While studying for my doctorate in ecolo gy I had become interested in the effects that spilled r adioac- tive materials could have on natural and man-made ecosystems. Since I was doing field research in an area liberally sprinkled with Minuteman missile silos, i t was not long before my interests expanded to include th e ecological consequences of a full scale thermonucle ar war. My concern about these effects naturally led me into contact with a group of disarmament activists, in whose company I visited a SAC bomber and missile base for a tour of the facilities. I also attended a series of meetings sponsored by the group in which they showe d anti-nuclear weapons films and presented talks by prominent disarmament speakers. It was during those meetings that I first began to be really alarmed—bu t not the way you might think. The basis for my concern was the bumbling incom- petence of the disarmament activists. Their stated goal was to draw people into their meetings, educate the m about the dangers of the arms race, and eventually initiate a public drive to have the weapons abolish ed. But the disarmament people I knew were absolutely incapable of motivating the public to follow their banner. The effect of their presentations was only to discredit themselves and encourage the audience to leave early. How would you feel if you went to a \"peace\"meet- ing and were forced to watch films or slides of bur ned, mutilated, and dismembered human beings? What would be your reaction to a prominent expert who insisted that there was no way you could save yours elf— that a nuclear war would utterly destroy mankind? T he people I saw at those meetings were sickened, disco ur- aged, and disgusted. They had come because they wer e mildly interested in \"doing something\" about nuclea r weapons, but they departed with the impression that disarmament activists were masochistic deviates who enjoyed torturing themselves (and others) with imag es of pain and despair. The audience felt brutalized a nd repulsed, and reacted with condemnation not for the weapons but for the people who had run the meeting. I have since become convinced that this condition is char- acteristic of most disarmament groups. It's no wond er that their efforts never get anywhere. This incompetence was disheartening to me, but I was more concerned by the lack of truthful informat ion in the talks and films. Having read the original re search on nuclear weapons effects, I was painfully aware o f the distortions and outright lies which the films and s peak- ers were passing off as \"the truth about nuclear wa r.\" Let me give you some examples. One speaker who had participated in the design and construction of the first atomic bomb was asked by a member of the audience, \"Where can I go to avoid be ing caught in fallout after an atomic attack?\" The spea ker replied, \"Oh, maybe the north coast of Alaska.\" Fro m my studies I knew that there are many areas of the United States which stand very little chance of get ting any fallout at all, even in the event of an all-out attack on our cities. The speaker was apparently not too inte rested in the facts. On a different occasion a speaker was asked, \"What would you do right now if the bombs started falling ?\" He made a gesture of resignation and replied, \"What co uld I do? Nothing.'\" This speaker was standing in a semin ar room within a well-shielded steel and concrete buil ding of considerable size, complete with two cafeterias, rest- rooms, a first aid station, a bowling alley, and a book- store. What could he have done? He could have grabb ed a bite to eat, selected a good book, and sat down i n safety to wait it out. Somehow that wasn't the impr es- sion I got from his answer. My objections were not entirely local, however. One evening I was listening to a National Public Ra dio"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"broadcast about the dangers of nuclear war when I heard a supposedly knowledgeable \"expert\" remark th at nuclear war was unthinkable because \"the National Academy of Sciences has recently shown that a nucle ar war would kill everyone in the northern hemisphere. \" This remark hit me particularly hard. I had just fi nished reading the NAS report in question and it had said nothing of the kind. In fact, the report had been h arshly criticized because it had not made any such stateme nt. The real NAS conclusion was that there is nothing a bout a nuclear war which can exterminate the human race. 1 The truth doesn't count in the disarmament debate. There is no need to lie to people about the effects of a nuclear war. The truth is bad enough. The damage done by making the threat seem worse than it really is cannot be easily dispelled. The exaggerated tales o f total annihilation convince people that survival is impos sible. This is not true. For most Americans, survival of a t least the first few weeks following a nuclear attack is n ot only possible, it is almost unavoidable. With careful pr epara- tion, any family or small group of people can insur e its own survival under such conditions and also through the long period of recovery to follow. I feel that the \"survival\" message is a much more useful approach to educating people about the dange rs of nuclear war than the \"disarm or die\" approach because it is positive and hopeful. There will be n o political solution to the nuclear arms race until t he American people make a potent political issue of th e matter, and there will be no such mobilization unti l they can be shown a way to discuss the subject without brutalizing themselves in the process. It is clear (at least to me) that an audience will be much more receptive to a speaker who tells them that they are going to live than they will be to someone who insists that they are a ll going to die. There was something else that made me mad enough to write this book. I decided to check into the official disaster preparations provided for us by U ncle Sam. The simplest way to do this was to go down to the local courthouse and interview the county director of civil defense. The fellow was a retired policeman w ho worked half time covering the paperwork of an offic e where he officially had nothing to do except \"be re ady\" all the time. In that office I heard a sincere tale of woe. This man took his job seriously and was very frus- trated by the condition of the civil defense system . He told me of \"the good old days\" when the fallout she lter boom was at its peak and the CD officers had locate d, labeled, and stocked enough shelters to house half the population of the country, if necessary. Since then , he sighed, funding for civil defense had dropped sharp ly in each succeeding year. The food and medications stoc k- piled in the 1960s had been cycled off the shelves and not replaced. Emergency field hospitals and generators had lapsed into disrepair and had been junked. Our city didn't even have any air raid sirens anymore. Then he told me about the new \"crisis relocation plans\" which had replaced the shelter plans in most areas. Cities near high-priority targets now had de tailed evacuation plans, intended to get the people out of the danger area and into a safe \"host community\" when international tensions became dangerous. I listened in amazement as he described the monumental task of uprooting hundreds of thousands of people and ship- ping them from one city to another. He pointed out that the 50,000 refugees destined for our area would fin d enough \"extra\" space in local homes and buildings t o accommodate them. He was not very confident about being able to feed and medicate the extra people, h ow- ever, nor was he very enthusiastic about how the lo cals would react to the imposition. Then I asked him what he would be able to do for us (and the refugees) if the atomic attack actually to ok place, destroying the cities the refugees had left and possibly the bulk of civilization too? He thought t hat one over for a long time and then replied, \"Nothing . All I could do would be to go home, get out my personal disaster supplies, take them down in my shelter, an d shut the door after me.\" I have looked into the national civil defense situa - tion more closely since that time, and it is appall ing. The people involved know what to do, but they have virt u- ally no money with which to do it. In fact, a frien d in the business recently informed me that President Carter has quietly ended what little civil defense research ha d been going on. I guess it's not \"nice\" to think that we might need the information. The last step in deciding to write this book occurr ed when I read Mel Tappan's Survival Guns, an encyclo- pedic tour of the world of survival and combat fire - arms. 2 Tappan's orientation was toward the needs of \"retreaters\" and \"survivalists.\" These are people w ho plan to survive any possible collapse of civilizati on by becoming self-sufficient for the duration of the di stur- bance. Many have formed \"retreat groups\" by banding together and buying rural property which they inten d to occupy when life in the cities becomes too dangerou s. I had never heard of retreaters or survivalists, but a little research uncovered the fact that there are many tho u- sands of such people throughout the country, with t heir own newsletters, newspapers, literature, and celebr ities. This appeared to me to be an audience which would b e interested in how to survive a nuclear war, and who (to judge from survivalist literature) had some fundame ntal gaps in their knowledge of what they were up agains t. I went out and made an effort to meet retreaters an d discovered some interesting things. Some survivalis ts are crazy. Others are simply prudent and want to be sure that their families will be safe in the event of so me"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"widespread danger, such as an earthquake, hurricane , economic collapse, or nuclear attack. Survivalists don't have a strong political identity. I have met people from the right, left, and middle of the political road w ho were making virtually identical survival preparations. I was surprised to find whole factions of the movement mo ti- vated by religious reasons (Methodists and Mormons, largely). Some groups were very involved with guns and physical defense; others had no guns and were m ore in favor of a spiritual defense. Some people are pr epared to survive for several years completely cut off fro m outside help. Most have prepared for one year of se lf- sufficiency. A few are satisfied with emergency pre para- tions good only for a period of a few weeks. Most survivalists currently have their collective eye on the nation's economy, expecting a collapse any moment. Some are more concerned with racial tensions, or th e possibility of famine. (Incidentally, I have used t he terms \"survivalist\" and \"retreater\" interchangeably in this book, but the reader should be aware that many people don't like to be called \"retreaters.\" They t hink it sounds cowardly.) So I joined the retreat movement. I searched through lengthy shelves of government publications, interviewed experts, purchased equipment to test in the field, learned to shoot, hunt, garden, grind grain, bake bread, build fallout shelters, predict fallout patt erns, recognize wild food plants, and even went so far as to learn how to be my own doctor (sometimes). When I finished, I called up the publisher of this book an d told him what I had in mind. A year later, here it is. Surviving a nuclear war, or any catastrophe, requires a little luck. That is inescapable. With e ffort, preparation, and foresight, the amount of luck requ ired becomes small, however. There are no insurmountable obstacles. I know this for a fact. I have actively sought out the truth behind the rumors, questioned the exp erts, brought my own scientific training to bear on evalu ating their conclusions, and I know that the nightmare of total annihilation is nothing more than a figure of speec h. An overworked figure of speech. Nuclear war will be the greatest social and biologi cal catastrophe our world has ever known. It will be unprecedented, but it will not be difficult to surv ive it. All you have to do is make an effort to understand the problems it will pose for you, and then systematica lly eliminate them one at a time. It can be done. This book tells you how. And if in the course of reading you should happen to learn a little bit more about the threat which n uclear weapons pose to us, and if you should happen to lis ten a little more critically to the words of our politici ans, and if you eventually contribute in some way to elimina ting the problem . . . that would be all right with me, too.

I HAVE DESIGNED Life after Doomsday as a com- prehensive survival manual intended to give a famil y or small group of people the information necessary to pre- pare for and survive a major disaster with a minimu m of discomfort. Although my main thrust is toward survi v- ing a full-scale thermonuclear war, I have consider ed many other disasters, both natural and man-made, an d have provided for them in the survival plans. Wheth er your main concern lies with famine, disease, natura l catastrophes, political disruption, economic collap se, or the slow and inevitable depletion of our natural re sour- ces, you will find the survival information you nee d within these pages. When discussing the subject of do-it-yourself civil defense preparation, I have often been asked questi ons like \"But what are you afraid of?\" or, \"Isn't it a little paranoid to be stockpiling food and things?\" I have never known quite how to answer these questions. It seems to me that there are people who see the world as a somewhat risky place, and then there are others who just can't see any risks at all. I tend to regard the la tter group as color-blind to danger—perhaps \"danger- blind\" would be the best term to describe them. The risks we take simply by living in the United States durin g the twentieth century are real and ever-present, and I don't think it's paranoid to recognize them. My attitude is that there is a little danger in everything we do and it is reasonable to take precautions to minimize our risk s. The alternative is to assume you are safe until cir cum- stances prove you wrong. 1 just can't go along with that policy. But paranoid or not, the question \"What are you afraid of?\" is one that really should be answered. If you are considering taking steps to see that you, your family, and perhaps a small circle of friends will be able to survive some kind of danger, it is reasonable to wo nder just what kind of catastrophe concerns you. This ch ap- ter is a brief summary of the possible troubles whi ch an American might have to face within the next few yea rs. It is intended as a complete listing, a sort of whi rlwind tour of the worst nightmares of mankind. Several of these disasters are virtually certain to happen, ot hers are very unlikely, and a few might even be impossible. Most would be temporary problems which would force you t o depend on your own resources for a few weeks at mos t. One or two of the others, however, could shatter We st- ern civilization completely. All of these crises are survivable in comfort and security. It takes time, effort, and the expenditur e of some money, but the result is well worth the invest ment. The result is saving your life. Famine Starvation is an old companion of mankind. To those of us who have never been hungry except when dieting, the idea of wanting food and not being abl e to get any is hard to imagine. But it has happened, an d under certain circumstances it could happen to us t oday in America. Simply because we do not fear hunger do es not mean we will never be hungry. There are numerous examples of crop failures in history; these are usually due to severe weather or fungal plant diseases. Before the 1880s there were no effe ctive fungicide treatments, and the airborne spores of fo od- destroying blights sometimes laid waste to the crop s of entire countries—even continents. Crop failures wer e common, and famine frequently followed. The best known example of such a crop failure was the potato murrain of Ireland, which struck in the 1840s. The Irish peasants were dependent on the potato for food, with each family eating about thirty-two poun ds of potatoes each day. The potatoes and a little pep per water made up their entire diet. Then, in 1846, a n ew disease struck without warning. A contemporary wit- ness wrote: 1 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"On July 27th ... I passed from Cork to Dublin, and this doomed plant bloomed with all the luxuriance of an abundant harvest. Returning on August 3rd, I beheld with sorrow one wide waste of putrifying vegetation . In many places the wretched people were seated on the fences of their decaying gardens, wringing their ha nds and wailing bitterly at the destruction which had l eft them foodless. 1 The result was an exodus of people from Ireland, where those too poor or too weak to leave tried to sustain themselves on unfamiliar natural foods whic h were soon exhausted. Millions died. When a new disease of wheat appeared in India during World War II, the wheat crop was so severely reduced that many Indian peasants starved. India's grain reserves would have been adequate to meet the demand, but a combination of government bungling and private greed raised the price of grain so high that the food was unavailable to the common person. Unab le to grow food and unable to buy it, the peasants sim ply died. 2 In the United States, crop failure due to infectiou s disease has not been common, but it has occurred. I n 1946, for example, another new grain disease appear ed. This one, called \"crown rust,\" appeared in oat fiel ds from Texas to New York and from Florida to Idaho, producing a severe reduction in the oat crop of tha t year. As recently as 1970, a totally new strain of fungus appeared and threatened to destroy the American cor n crop. We were fairly lucky that time because it hap pened to be a dry year, unfavorable to a fungus, and only 15 percent of the crop was lost. The discovery that th e entire corn crop, coast to coast, had no resistance to the new disease was very disturbing, however. Changes i n corn genetics were quickly made, steps toward chemi cal control of the disease were taken, and the situatio n was rapidly brought under control. 3 What would happen if a new disease should break out and destroy a major American crop in the next f ew years? It isn't likely that we will starve because we have a diverse economy based on a wide variety of grain an d feed crops, not to mention table vegetables and fru its. That does not mean that we would not suffer in any way, however. If the corn crop had actually failed in 19 70, the price of feed grain for poultry and livestock would have risen out of sight. Food prices would have followed . The impact on the economy would have been very serious, increasing inflation and upsetting the internationa l bal- ance of trade. Only if the new disease appeared in con- junction with poor weather would we be in actual danger of shortages. What about bad weather as a cause of crop failures? You've probably heard that some people think the ne xt ice age is coming, and all kinds of dire prediction s have been made concerning this over the last few years. I think we can safely ignore ice ages, but there are other possibilities which leave me feeling a little uneas y. One of these was described in a CIA report issued recen tly which pointed out that our entire agricultural scie nce is based on the kind of weather we have had over the p ast thirty years. 4 The report also pointed out that the last thirty years have been a very unusual period of goo d growing weather, the best since the Middle Ages. Th ere- fore, all of our agricultural techniques are based on weather conditions which are not normal and which could revert to more typical weather at any time. I examined the evidence behind this conclusion and found it pretty disturbing. The weather during 1976, the year following the CIA report, seemed to bear out investigators' predi c- tions of poor farming weather and severe variations in rainfall. 5 California had been suffering from a drought during the preceding year, and there was some optim ism in February when rain and snow storms arrived in th e Los Angeles area. It turned out that the worst drou ght in seventy years was destined to go on a little longer , unfortunately. Later, Oklahoma received 1/3 inch of rain, and the governor called on the entire state t o pray for more. They were having a drought of their own. In March, the farmers of Wisconsin had a little too much rain, accompanied by high winds, storms, and flooding. At the same time, a government study show ed that, due to prolonged drought, wind erosion in the Great Plains had spread over the largest area in tw enty years. June brought floods in Georgia, Texas, and South Dakota. Part of Georgia was declared a disaster are a because of flooding, as were areas of South Dakota that suffered from flooding and mudslides. The Texas inc i- dent involved 7 1/2 to 12 inches of rain that fell in Houston in twenty-four hours; this was more than the city's storm drains could carry away. In July, the Kansas-Missouri border area relived the Houston experience with a twelve-inch downpour overnight, after which the National Guard and Civil Defense authorities evacuated 1,000 residents of fl ooded farm counties. A week later, severe thunderstorms h it Buffalo and Rochester, New York, knocking out utili - ties and flooding homes. California's record-breaki ng drought continued to destroy crops and livestock. In August, while heavy rains were flooding Miami, Florida, the governor of Nebraska declared over hal f of his state to be an official disaster area. It still hadn't had any rain. Neither had North Carolina, where the cit y of Raleigh banned all unnecessary use of water to cons erve enough for drinking. A sudden September shower in Palm Desert, California, produced a flash flood tha t damaged 100 homes. October brought floods and a sta te of emergency to Pennsylvania, while Oregon was seed - ing clouds for rain. The overall picture is certain ly not LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"one of even, reliable agricultural weather. Don't think that weather doesn't change. It does. Sunny southern California was a hurricane coast as recently as the early 1800s, for instance. 6 It looks like our world population, which has grown by 50 percent ove r the last thirty years, may soon have to subsist on food grown in droughty summers punctuated by abrupt downpours and unpredictably early snowfalls. When you hear people complain about poor crops, remember the CIA report. Famine does not have to be only the result of crop failure, however. Food shipments could be halted ve ry easily in our country if truck and rail transportat ion were interrupted for any reason. If the trucks don' t arrive, the supermarkets don't have any food to sel l. Floods, winter storms, prolonged labor strikes, and high inflation can produce starvation even When the fiel ds (or warehouses) are full of food. The Indian grain famine of the 1940s, when food was too expensive to buy, is one example of this ki nd of emergency. Another is provided by the 25 million Ru s- sians who starved to death in the 1920s, following the end of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. Although the country was suffering from years of wa r and revolution, there was still a little grain in t he ware- houses. Unfortunately, it was doled out to only a f ew. Workers received full rations, but formerly upper o r middle class families received almost nothing. An e ye- witness in 1919 wrote: I met a woman and child, ragged and thin as skeleto ns, the child crying constantly with an unchanging expr es- sion of terror. The mother said that the child was hungry, and asked for a piece of bread, as they had not eaten in twenty-four hours. I opened my purse, but the woman turned away saying, \"No, not money, but bread.\" I have seen children, hardly clothed, ho llow cheeked and with forms like shadows, on their knees in the street trying to pick from between the paving s tones grains of wheat that had fallen from a torn sack. I have seen before bakeries men, women, and ch ildren stretched on the cold stones, awaiting through days and nights their turn to eat their meager ration of bre ad and then often falling exhausted and dying at the doors tep before they receive it. 7 As the famine worsened, people fled from the cities to live with relatives in the country. Of those who st ayed in Petrograd (because they had nowhere to go), over 40,000 died the following October when winter set i n. Overall, the population of the city fell from 2.5 m illion to 300,000. What would you do if the cupboards were bare, the stores were empty, and there was a long winter ahea d? Epidemic Disease Disease is another old enemy of our species and has played a very large part in our history. As modern Americans, many of us have never seen a friend or relative die of an infectious disease, and we tend to think that modern medicine can cure anything. It isn't tr ue, and of all the biological threats to civilization, the danger of pestilence is one of the most real and frightening. 8 There are many diseases to which humans are vulnerable. Cholera and smallpox have been two of t he worst in the history of our country, but for the sa ke of discussion plague and Lassa fever will be described . Plague is one of the oldest diseases of man, and La ssa fever is one of the newest. Each tells us something about our vulnerability. Plague is a disease of mammals, usually wild and domestic rodents, but includes humans in some circu m- stances. It has been known and feared since the thi rd century, and three major pandemics have occurred. T he first took place in the sixth century and killed an esti- mated 100 million people in Europe and Asia. The second, which killed 75 million, happened in the fo ur- teenth century and is remembered as the \"Black Deat h\" because of skin discoloration suffered by the victi ms. Fifty million people died in Europe alone, which wa s about one quarter of the entire population. (Imagin e the calamity if every family of four in your neighborho od lost one member to a disease.) The third pandemic began in China in 1894 and spread to the United Sta tes by 1900. Casualties were not severe, but the diseas e is still with us—waiting quietly in the rodent populat ion of the Southwest. In the United States, plague is known to be present in California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Nev - ada, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Michi- gan, Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas, North Dakota, and Hawaii, as well as areas in Mexic o and Canada. It is carried by wild rats, ground squi rrels, mice, marmots, owls (which eat rodents), gophers, badgers, rabbits, prairie dogs, and chipmunks. Tick s, lice, and bedbugs occasionally serve as carriers fr om the animals to humans, but usually the disease is trans mit- ted from a wild rodent to a domestic rat, from the rat to a flea, and from the flea to a human victim. The victim feels fine for two to four days after be ing bitten and then quickly gets very sick with chills, fever, headache, vomiting, delirium and other unlovely sym p- toms. Untreated, the disease is 50 to 90 percent fa tal, death occurring within a week of the first symptoms . The only good thing about it is that the person who has been bitten by the flea will probably not infect an yone else, unless all are sharing fleas and lice. Unfortunately, about 5 percent of the sufferers develop lesions in their lungs, and soon they begin to cough plague germs into the air. Anyone who inhales these germs is virtually doomed. The new victim soo n 3 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"begins to cough, too, and the plague can then sprea d from person to person like wildfire. Without immedi ate treatment with antibiotics, a victim of airborne pl ague has only one to five days to live. It is always fat al. 9 Could an epidemic of plague get started in the United States in this antiseptic age? It would not be surprising to hear that five people had died of thi s disease in far-away Madagascar in June, 1976. After all, those primitive tropical republics don't have the m edical facilities we do, and their grasp of sanitation is almost nonexistent. It's more disturbing to realize that i n the same month a twenty-two year old woman was diag- nosed as a plague victim in Colorado, and a twelve year old boy developed the disease in New Mexico. 10 That spring saw our worst series of bubonic plague cases in recent years, with eleven victims and two deaths sp read over six western states. In 1976, there were a tota l of sixteen plague cases in the United States, followed by fifteen cases in 1977. One episode involved the dev elop- ment of plague pneumonia (the contagious form) in three widely separated victims, in California, New Mex- ico, and Arizona. Only one of them recovered. Fortu - nately, these patients lived in areas of low popula tion density where the spread of the disease could be ha lted easily. Under the circumstances, though, one can't help but wonder how long it will be before an illegal al ien with a fleabite sneaks into the barrios of Los Ange les and then refuses to see a doctor when the coughing and fever set in. He'll cough, his friends will cough, their friends will cough.... It would not take much to st art an epidemic, and even a few cases could cause a seriou s panic. The Black Death is more than a disease; it i s a legend. People run from it in terror, and in so doi ng spread the disease wherever they go. You have probably heard of plague, but what about Lassa fever? This was a completely new and unknown disease that first appeared in Nigeria in 1 969 and which eventually killed over two-thirds of the peo- ple who caught it. The first known case was a missi onary nurse who died within ten days of getting sick. The next case was a second nurse who had cared for the first one during her illness. Then another nurse died, then members of the hospital staff, then the doctors, th en visitors. A victim was flown from Nigeria to New Yo rk so the disease could be studied and identified. Soo n two scientists at the Yale arbovirus research laborator y were sick. One of these workers had not been exposed to the disease specimens at all. When he died, all work wa s stopped at once. The disease was too dangerous to study. The one-third of the patients who survived did so only with the help of elaborate modern medical supp ort devices. They recovered only slowly, suffering from nerve damage and extreme debilitation. The first su rvi- vor lost twenty-eight pounds in three weeks before her condition stabilized. Untreated victims all died. It's frightening to think that new deadly diseases can arise for which medical science has no treatmen t, but to me the really chilling part of this story is that a patient sick with an unknown and extremely dangerou s disease was casually put on board a jet flight full of tourists, who were all exposed and who subsequently scattered all over the country. During the outbreak of the disease in Nigeria, missionaries, Peace Corps p er- sonnel, and tourists were traveling in and out of t he area constantly. Lassa fever didn't turn out to be routi nely infectious, since the viral particles had to be pas sed from one person to another through body fluids such as b lood or urine, but occasional patients who project virus -laden drops of mucus during coughing are not unknown. Except for the comparative rarity of these infectio us cases, Lassa fever might have provided us with a le sson in epidemic disease which we would have remembered for a long time.\" The danger has not passed, however. In March of 1976, another Lassa fever victim passed through Dul les airport in Washington, DC, exposing 300 fellow trav - elers who rode the same jumbo jet across the Atlant ic. 12 Public health officials scattered to seventeen stat es to locate and examine these potential victims. All tur ned out to be well. In August, yet another case appeare d, this time in Toronto, where health authorities closed th e hospital and quarantined it until they could be sur e that the patient was no longer contagious. Eleven people were found who had been in contact with this patien t, and some of them were discovered just as they were beginning to get sick. The pattern was repeated in May of 1977, when an English air traveler came down wit h the disease shortly after returning to London from Africa. Again the search for fellow air travelers w as undertaken, made more difficult this time by the fa ct that they had scattered to various countries, not j ust to different portions of one country. The dimension th at modern air travel adds to epidemic disease is that a serious outbreak in one country can spread all over the world in days or weeks. It's a very alarming though t. There is a serious danger of the United States suffering an epidemic of a more familiar disease so me- time soon. Public health officials report that less than two-thirds of today's school children have been imm un- ized against the common childhood diseases of polio , diphtheria, measles, pertussus, and mumps. Young pa r- ents, and to some extent young doctors, have never seen a polio epidemic and tend to think that such diseas es are things of the past. Epidemics aren't things of the past. We only have to wait long enough to see all that su ffer- ing take place again. 13 Would you know what to do if a life-threatening disease spread into your community?

These traumas do n ot normally threaten civilizations, but they do threat en lives. And they seem to happen all the time. I had an experience recently which illustrates the power of winter storms and blizzards. As part of a business trip to Washington, DC, I had a brief layo ver in New York. I was sitting in Kennedy International Ai r- port on a Thursday night waiting for my flight when it began to snow outside; in the space of an hour, abo ut six inches of snow accumulated. Two hours later, when t he plane was scheduled to leave, there was over a foot of snow on the ground and it was still coming down. Fo rty- mile-per-hour winds were preventing the ground serv ice crews from clearing the runways and de-icing the pl anes. Naturally the airport had to be closed. I spent two full days sitting in that terminal beca use the storm didn't let up. The snow became so deep th at it was impossible to leave by any means. No buses or t rains were running, and the few taxis willing to brave th e six-foot drifts were charging hundreds of dollars f or a ride into the city. Although the airline provided u s with meal tickets to the cafeteria in the building, the three or four hundred of us trapped in the terminal had to s hift for ourselves when it came to anything else. I talk ed the gate agents into raiding the parked airplanes for blankets and pillows after seeing too many cold chi ldren lying huddled together on plastic airport furniture or on ice-cold marble floors. The experience gave me a lo t of time to think about survival preparation during lar ge- scale emergencies. Fortunately the delay was only f orty- eight hours, because I had developed two large, raw skin infections that almost covered my shins, and there was no way for me to get to a doctor until the snow had been cleared away. It made me wonder what I would have done if there had been no doctor to turn to at all. Later, I went over the newspaper accounts of the storm and learned that the snowfall had been the he avi- est in nine years and had caused the collapse of nu mer- ous roofs, including a supermarket and a 3,500-seat auditorium. Some neighborhoods were still snowbound the following Monday. One hospital ran out of suppl ies and food as early as Sunday morning, only three day s after the trucks stopped running. Hospital staff members hiked through the drifts to purchase food f or the patients. They said people gave them odd looks when they bought grocery baskets full of bread. I s up- pose they did. 14 Summer storms, too, can threaten human life and property. The tornadoes of the Midwestern states ki ll an average of 100 people each year, striking with unbe lieva- ble frequency from Colorado to Carolina, and from t he Gulf Coast well past the Canadian border. Throughou t this region an average-sized county (about fifty mi les square) receives a tornado every year or two, and i n central Oklahoma this average rises as high as .3 t o 4 twisters each year. (See figure 11 for an illustrat ion of tornado frequency in the United States.) Occasional ly, flurries of tornadoes strike the Midwest with devas tating results. The estimated 100 tornadoes that swept thr ough Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virgi- nia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illino is, Michigan and Ontario during eight hours on the nigh t of April 2, 1974, represent one of the worst of these disas- ters. These tornadoes killed 324 people and severel y damaged scores of communities, leaving thousands of people homeless. Xenia, Ohio, a town of 25,000, was hit particularly hard, with half of its homes destroyed . For- tunately, there had been sufficient warning for the inhabitants to take shelter in basements, and only 30 were killed. A similar rash of tornadoes occurred on April 11, 1965, when forty-seven funnels killed a total of 25 7 people in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and I lli- nois. The greatest single disaster caused by a torn ado was the result of a single twister that ravaged Mis souri, Illinois, and Indiana in 1925. It took 689 lives. S ince that time, there have been eleven tornadoes which have e ach taken over 100 lives; six killed more than 200. All caused massive destruction of homes, utilities, and commun ica- tions. 15 Hurricanes are another natural disaster to which millions of Americans are subject each year. The fr e- quency of hurricanes varies, but on the average one passes over some section of the United States every year. Between 1900 and 1969, these storms killed a total of 12,000 Americans—about 174 per year. Hurricanes bring with them winds as high as 200 miles per hour , torrential rains, high tides and heavy seas, and ca n threaten life and property over areas hundreds of m iles wide. One of the worst hurricanes of recent years was hurricane Camille of 1969. Camille came in from the Carribean over the Mississippi coast towns of Gulf Port, Biloxi, Bay St. Louis, and Pass Christian; these to wns were subjected to winds in excess of 205 miles per hour. Every house suffered damage, and in Bay St. Louis h alf the main business section of town simply disappeare d into the sea. One hundred thousand people were evac u- ated from the coastal area of Mississippi and Louis iana, but the storm soon raged inland up the Mississippi valley into unprepared states. Within twenty-four hours, it had turned to the east. Three days after first crossing the coast, Camille passed over Virginia an d out 5 IT'S A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"into the Atlantic. In its wake were hundreds of dea d and hundreds of thousands left without homes. As a last gesture, Camille dumped ten inches of rain on Rich- mond, Virginia in one cloudburst, drowning at least 75 people (111 were missing). 16 Flash floods, of course, do not require hurricanes in order to take place. Small flash floods are really quite common, so much so that we tend to ignore them. Larger floods occur more rarely, and we ignore them so successfully that many people living in the path of flood- waters don't even realize it. For instance, there was a time during this century when most of the Los Angeles basin was under water. Between February 18 and 24, 1914, over nineteen inc hes of rain fell in the San Gabriel mountains north of Los Angeles, and since the ground was already saturated by previous rain storms, the entire deluge ran off int o the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers. These rivers ar e dry most of the year, but that February they suddenly b egan to flow with a volume equivalent to the Colorado Ri ver at full flood. Other canyon streams contributed alm ost as much water. On the 19th, the streets of Los Ange les were beneath two feet of water and the city had bee n cut off from outside aid. On the 20th, hundreds of acre s of Orange County were under water, and Long Beach had become an island. The entire area between the prese nt civic center and San Pedro harbor was submerged. Te le- graph lines were washed out, as well as bridges, ro ads, public utilities, and countless orange groves. Sant a Bar- bara was cut off and isolated. Flood waters in the moun- tains destroyed so many bridges that passenger trai ns became trapped on mountain grades, unable to advanc e or retreat because of washed out tracks. 17 The actual toll in lives after the waters receded w as fairly small, due mainly to the fact that most of t he inundated area was devoted to citrus farming. If su ch a flood were to take place today, the price would be much higher because those former orchards are now a mega lo- polis of suburban housing tracts. Virtually none of these people know about the 1914 flood. The fact that Cal ifor- nia's prolonged drought has at last ended in the eq uival- ent of two years' worth of rain in the space of thr ee months underlines the ever-present possibility of a re- currence. Even the best flood-control efforts somet ime succumb to floods so bad they only occur once in a century. Since we're discussing the perils of life in southe rn California, it's appropriate at this point to shift to the subject of wildfire. Forest fires and grass fires c an be natural disasters anywhere in the country, but the explosive vegetation of the California foothills is partic- ularly dangerous. The chaparral brushlands are plan t communities that seem to actually encourage holocau st fires. Naturally, thousands of Californians have bu ilt expensive houses on chaparral-covered hills. Having conducted field research on fire history in chaparral, I once made myself unpopular while visit ing friends by saying that I wouldn't want to live wher e they did, in spite of the beautiful view from their brus hy hillside lot. A few months later the Santa Barbara fire of June, 1977 destroyed their house along with 185 oth ers. They had seen the fire coming but had barely had ti me to pack their most valued possessions into the car bef ore the flames got too close. Then they couldn't find t he car keys. There was no time to search. They got away wi th their lives and were pleased to have saved that muc h. They were fortunate that there was a road leading a way from the fire; in many rural residential areas the roads lead up the canyons and stop in a dead end. When a fire comes up the canyon there is no place to go. 18 The subject of wildfire leads naturally to a relate d topic—that of volcanic eruptions. You probably don' t think you are in any danger from a volcano, and unl ess you live in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California or Hawaii, you are right. Unfortunately, a large volca nic eruption can have effects on the weather that might one day make us all feel a little insecure. Major volca nic eruptions such as that of Krakatoa, Java in 1883, o r Mt. Tambora, Indonesia in 1815 can inject incredible amounts of dust into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface by as much as 20 percent. The effect lasts only one to th ree years, but in the meantime a world-wide drop in tem per- ature can take place. The Mt. Tambora eruption pulv er- ized six cubic miles of rock and injected the resul ting dust high into the atmosphere. It produced actual f am- ines in Europe and North America by causing repeate d blizzards and hard frosts throughout the summer of 1816. Crops were very scarce that year. Four simila r, but smaller, eruptions have taken place within the last century. 19 Of course, if you do happen to live near an active volcano, you are certainly aware of the problems it is capable of presenting to you: molten lava, heavy ra ins, volcanic ash which can pile up and turn to thick mu d when the rain hits it, the rock \"bombs\" which fall out of the air, the poisonous and sometimes superheated ga ses, and, lastly, the earthquakes which accompany volcan ic activity. I visited Hawaiian Volcanoes National Par k in 1971 a few days after an eruption and walked around on a still-hot lava flow that had cut off the island's main coastal highway, forming an absolutely impassable roadblock. It was very impressive. The barrier was too hot to bulldoze or blast, too insecure to build a r oad over, and too big to go around. Islanders were luck y they had another highway paralleling the coast a fe w miles inland. On another occasion, I visited the ru ins of Pompeii, Italy, the town buried for centuries under LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 6"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"millions of tons of volcanic ash until its excavati on by modern archaeologists. The ruins were dominated by nearby Mt. Vesuvius. If you really want a survival night- mare, getting caught in a volcanic eruption is one of the worst. 20 What about earthquakes? It is commonly thought that if you don't live on the west coast you are pr etty safe from earthquakes. It is true that (as of March 17, 1976) the United States Geological Survey has officially noti- fied the governor of California that a major earthq uake equivalent to the San Francisco quake of 1906 is expected to hit southern California sometime within the next few years. Earthquake prediction has reached t he point where geologists can predict a tremor, but ca nnot yet define the exact time when it will strike. Rece ntly, an earthquake in China was successfully predicted to within twelve hours, but in the United States the a bility to make such predictions is not that advanced. 21 (We aren't world leaders in everything.) The fact remains that most of the United States is earthquake country, and only about 10 percent of us can rest easy that we are safe from this source of trou ble. People outside of the areas of high seismic activit y are really in the most danger, because their local buil ding codes are not designed to produce quake-resistant h ous- ing. As an example of a Midwestern earthquake, con- sider the 1811 tremor near New Madrid, Missouri, which was so violent that it caused 200 square mile s of forest to sink below the level of the Mississippi R iver, forming extensive lakes such as Reelfoot Lake in northwestern Tennessee. On the east coast there was the quake which destroyed Charleston, South Carolina in 1886. It was felt in every state east of the Missis sippi. Earthquakes in coastal areas sometimes generate tsunamis, the seismic sea waves mistakenly called \" tidal waves.\" Unless you live on the coast of a large bod y of water, you don't need to worry about them. But if y ou do live in such an area, tsunamis are worth conside ring. The Hawaiian Islands, for instance, have been hit b y the giant waves thirty times—since they were first disc ov- ered by Captain Cook in 1778. Following the Unimak, Alaska earthquake of 1946, seismic sea waves crosse d 2,240 miles of ocean to Hawaii in just four and a h alf hours. The waves rose to crests as high as 54 feet when they reached Hawaiian beaches. 22 The largest tsunami known all but destroyed the Minoan civilization in the Mediterranean in 1470 BC, crashing into port cities as a wall of water 165 feet high. Archeologists have est ab- lished the size of the wave from the distribution o f buried wreckage on the old city sites. 23 Natural catastrophes are a pervasive and continual worry to emergency planners because these crises ca n strike anywhere, at any time of the year, and can h ave results which vary from minor inconvenience to majo r disaster. Would your family be prepared to survive two or three weeks without utilities, food, medical hel p, or transportation? Would you be able to leave your hom e on a moment's notice to flee a fire, hurricane, flo od, or tornado, and then live on your own resources for da ys or weeks, perhaps using only what you were able to tak e with you? These possibilities are not just bad drea ms. They can happen to anyone, at any time, anywhere. They could happen to you. Religious Catastrophe A large number of survivalists, perhaps the major- ity, have become interested in emergency preparedne ss for religious reasons. The most obvious example is the Mormons, among whom many thousands of families now each have a year's supply of food stored away. Church leaders have adopted crisis preparation as a n official policy, even to the extent of using church funds to build granaries large enough to feed one-third o f the membership through a full year of famine. Their rea son, as explained to me by a friend who is a Mormon bish op, is simply that there seems to be a time of hardship in every life and it is sensible to prepare for it. \"W e take care of our own,\" he explained. A second group of survivalists with a religious motivation is Jim McKeever's branch of \"born again\" Christians. McKeever is one of the pillars of the r etreat movement who has successfully combined a knowledge of economics with \"the Word of God.\" If you want to see a carefully argued religious rationale for joining the survivalists, read McKeever's Christians Will Go through the Tribulation . . . And How to Prepare fo r It. 24 The basic theme is that the Scriptures warn of a catastrophic period of tribulation involving famine , earthquakes, economic collapse, and possibly nuclea r war, and that this time is near. The book also stre sses preparation and gives particularly good advice on monetary collapse and earthquake preparedness. Even if you aren't religious, the practical advice provi ded in this book is very worthwhile. Actually the \"religious catastrophe\" I referred to in the heading for this section is not a supernatural event, but is rather a sociological one. Looking back on t he fundamentalists' attempt to dominate the government (remember prohibition) and their attempt to subjuga te the sciences (the Scopes monkey trial), I get very uncom- fortable at the thought of an extreme religious gro up gaining political power. This could easily happen i n the aftermath of a national disaster such as a nuclear war. Religious intolerance has been a leading feature of human history, and zealots have a tendency to be ve ry casual with the lives, rights, and property of unbe lievers. Some people prepare for disaster because of the fears shared by their religious group. Others prepa re because they fear religious groups. Do you fall int o either category? 7 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Depletion of Natural Resources As an ecologist, I have a great respect for the rol e of natural resources—their conservation has been a con - cern of biologists for many years. The recent scare over the \"energy crisis\" has brought this subject into t he open, and many people feel that we are on the thres hold of imminent disaster. Others are convinced that the whole crisis is a con game staged by the oil compan ies to raise prices. Both could be right. The underlying fact is that the depletion of natura l resources is a proven civilization-killer. We tend to forget that ours is not the first major civilizatio n to flourish on the earth; most people have never even heard of all the minor civilizations that have existed. T hese last were mainly agricultural civilizations which topple d to disaster when poor farming practices finally destro yed the fertile farm lands which fed the cities. Take Iraq, for example, an area which today sup- ports barely one-quarter of the population which it had 4,000 years ago. The area depended on an elaborate irrigation system which was continually being choke d with silt, the product of runaway erosion in the ne arby highlands. When foreign armies conquered the area a nd freed the slaves, who kept the canals clear, farmin g became impossible and the civilization collapsed. A sim- ilar process of resource depletion occurred in Syri a, Lebanon, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Spain, Italy, Si cily, Yugoslavia, Greece, Crete, and Turkey, all of which now support less than half of the population they once had. 25 The primary fear we entertain today is that our \"slaves\" (machines) may be about to run out of \"foo d\" (oil) and our intricate civilization will come sput tering to a stop. There are lots of arguments about this, wit h wide differences of opinion about when the oil will run out, how fast we are using it up, and how much unknown o il remains hidden in the earth's crust. It really does n't matter. No one argues that the oil will not, in fac t, run out sooner or later. It will. Certainly no one disp utes that the Arabs, who have the largest reserves left in the world, are capable of rationing our supply or cutti ng it off if they like. They already have. And as for the United States' policy of developing the north slope of Ala ska as quickly as possible in order to become energy \"self - sufficient,\" that's like noticing that the gas tank is nearly empty and flooring the accelerator so you can get t o a service station before you run out. It's not very s mart. Ours is not the first energy crisis. There was a previous one in Britain in the sixteenth century. A t that time, wood was the main fuel for domestic and indus - trial uses as well as the primary source of buildin g material. By the seventeenth century, the English f orests had been depleted to the extent that a common joke was that Judas could never have found a tree to hang hi mself in Britain. Over the space of a century and a half, a shift from wood to coal gradually took place, an event wh ich eventually led to the beginning of the industrial r evolu- tion. The transition was completed without any seri ous difficulties by a natural evolution of technology t o meet the demands of society. 26 The danger of our energy crisis is that during the period when we are in transition from oil to some o ther energy source, there could be some difficult times. Our agriculture requires not only gasoline to run the e quip- ment, but oil-based fertilizers and insecticides as well. Without them, even for one year, we could not feed ourselves. Depending on how wisely the changeover t o new energy sources is handled, the transformation c ould be either simple and painless or a series of emerge ncies. Time will tell. Man-made Catastrophes Human beings, in their impetuous need to build bigger and better things, have managed to create bi gger and better kinds of disasters as time has gone by. We still can't match the sheer massiveness of a hurricane or earthquake, but in our own small way we have manage d to utterly destroy a city or two and hundreds of sm all towns over the years. The greatest tragedy is that many of these occurrences could have been avoided or rec og- nized in time for early evacuation. Too often they just happened, and days later, while searching through t he wreckage, people asked one another how it was possi ble. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is an exam- ple of a disaster that was at least partly man-made . For some time prior to the event, the local fire chief had insisted to the city council that San Francisco was inade- quately protected against fire. For one thing, the water mains all crossed the San Andreas fault, and no pro vi- sion had been made for the possibility that they wo uld break in an earthquake and leave the city without w ater. His pleas fell on deaf ears, and in the hours follo wing the quake the city burned to the ground. A large commun ity of wooden houses without fire protection is just a time bomb. The homes in the chaparral of California fall into this category. The problem of unsafe dams has also come to the public's attention several times over the last few years. The concern began on February 18, 1972, when a make - shift dam across Buffalo Creek, West Virginia over- flowed and then failed, releasing a sixty-foot high wall of muddy water which partially (and in some cases, who lly) destroyed fourteen communities of coal miners. The dam failure killed 60 people and left 5,000 homeles s. Just before the dam let go, a policeman tried to warn th e residents in the valley below, but few of them list ened. Those who left for high ground immediately were sti ll alive the next day even though their houses and bel ong- ings were completely swept away. It turned out that the \"dam\" had really been an overgrown pile of coal min ing waste that had just happened to block the stream an d LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 8"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"form a lake. The danger of flood was recognized by the locals, but no steps had been taken to prevent a di saster. They knew it had to be dangerous because the same d am had burst once before in 1966. In June of the same year, a second dam gave way. This one was in Rapid City, North Dakota, where hea vy rains and flooding were suddenly compounded by an earthen dam which failed and sent a raging torrent through the center of town. The flood left 155 dead , 500 missing, and 5,000 homeless, in spite of the fact t hat radio warnings had been given predicting that the d am would not hold for long. The result of these two incidents was the enactment of the federal Dam Safety Act of 1972, which provid ed that the Corps of Engineers would begin a routine s eries of inspections of the nation's 28,000 unregulated d ams to prevent a recurrence of the 1972 disasters. A fe w dams were specifically exempted from inspection, su ch as the 500 dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamati on. The Bureau had its own inspection program, and ther e was no need to duplicate the effort. It was about this time that plans were being made for the construction of a large Bureau of Reclamati on dam in Rexburg, Idaho. In spite of opposition by en vi- ronmentalists and hazard geologists, who said the d am was being built on a fault and would therefore be u nsafe, construction went ahead and the Teton Dam was com- pleted in early 1976. In June, as the dam was filli ng for the first time, a small leak developed under the ba se of the dam. Soon a section of the dam gave way, and th e pent-up waters raced down the valley, eventually ca us- ing eleven deaths and forcing 30,000 people in the upper Snake River valley to run for their lives. The subs equent inquiry showed that the Bureau had not heeded the warnings of outside geologists in the selection of the dam site, and that there was \"human error\" involved in the construction of the dam itself. Of course, the dam had been inspected and declared safe—another error. As a Bureau project, the Teton Dam had not been covered by the Dam Safety Act, but following its fa ilure, someone checked up on the 28,000 dams that were covered to see how many of them had been inspected since the law was passed in 1972. Zero. 27 As this chapter was being written, a source of danger to the average American was brought to my attention which I had not seriously considered befo re. In February of 1978, three train wrecks in the southea st portion of the country centered public and Congres- sional attention on the transportation of hazardous chemicals by rail. One freight train derailed near Waverly, Tennessee because a handbrake had acciden- tally been left on. The train included two tank car s of liquid propane gas, a highly explosive fuel. While attempting to empty one of the damaged cars, eleven people were killed and scores injured when the vola tile gases ignited and the tanker exploded. Shortly afte r- ward, a second train derailed, this time near Young s- town, Florida. The derailment was caused by sabotag e (somebody removed a rail) and resulted in the ruptu re of a tank car full of chlorine, the gas used in World War I as a chemical weapon. The cloud of green gas drifted o ver a nearby highway, where motorists driving into it dis co- vered that not only was it impossible to breathe, b ut that their car motors stopped dead. Eight people died an d 67 were hospitalized. The saboteur was one of the casu al- ties. Within a week there was another derailment, t his one purely by accident in Cades, Tennessee. This ti me it was a car full of sodium hydroxide which leaked, fo rcing the evacuation of 150 nearby residents. 28 The rapid succession of these accidents brought them to national attention for a few days, after wh ich they faded from the news again. Since there had bee n two similar incidents within a few miles of my home over the last few years, I became interested in just how often these train wrecks and chemical spills actually occ ur. The facts are enough to make anyone who lives near a railroad track nervous. For starters, in 1977 there were 7,858 train derail - ments in the United States, an average of 157 per s tate. Relatively few of these involved dangerous chemical s, but the list of serious incidents is still pretty l ong. In January, 1,000 Dover, New Hampshire residents fled from an overturned propane car. Three hundred peopl e were evacuated from their homes in Hanover, Ohio, following the derailment and explosion of a car ful l of vinyl chloride. In February, two square miles of Da llas, Texas were evacuated following the explosion of thr ee propane tankers. Another propane car derailment and explosion happened in March, in Wenden, Arizona. A small area in Delphi, Indiana was cleared when a tr ain carrying high explosives hit a truck at a crossing and derailed. At Inverness, Florida, a derailment spill ed 10,000 gallons of acid. In June, a collision of two trains in Neelyville, Missouri forced 400 people to flee w hile the resulting fire neared an explosive vinyl chlori de car. On June 27, a derailment in Metuchen, New Jersey damaged three cars laden with liquified chlorine ga s, but there was no evacuation because nobody knew what wa s in the cars. In August, 2,000 people in Novi, Michi gan were removed from the vicinity of a ruptured tank c ar carrying paradichlorobenzene, an insecticide. In Se p- tember, part of Watseka, Illinois was evacuated aft er an automobile collided with two trains and caused the leakage of toxic and explosive chemicals. Blooming- dale, Indiana was the scene of a derailment in Octo ber which ruptured a propane car. In November, 5,000 pe o- ple left their homes in Pensacola, Florida after a derailed tanker released ammonia gas. In Maryland, 400 peopl e 9 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"fled the vicinity of a train fire in which an ammon ia car was threatened. Thirty-six were subsequently treate d for chlorine poisoning from the same fire. In Nebraska, 771 residents of Battle Creek fled when a propane tanke r derailed and began to leak. Two hundred people evac u- ated an area in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania fol low- ing a derailment. The last entry for the year, immediately preceding the famous February accidents of 1978, occurred in Goldonna, Louisiana, where a truck-train collision caused an explosion and fire that destroyed one-third of the town and involved severa l tank cars of propane and chlorine gas. 29 I don't know about you, but after reading about these accidents (and hundreds of others that did no t release chemicals) my confidence in the nation's ra il- roads is shaken. The two accidents that happened ne ar my home involved a derailed chlorine car and a boxc ar full of highly toxic nuclear wastes which caught on fire. I think about them every time I see a train go by. There are many other types of man-made disasters, but one of the most alarming possibilities is a kin d of disaster that so far has happened only once. I refe r to the accidental large-scale release of radioactive mater ials into the air. Many people fear this will happen one day following an accident or sabotage at a nuclear powe r plant. If you have been sitting back and comfortabl y assuming that such things cannot happen (as the pow er companies assure us), you are in for a rude shock. Several of them, in fact. There is adequate evidence now to support the story that in 1958 a Soviet nuclear waste storage f acility in the Ural mountains accidentally exploded \"like a violent volcano.\" Tons of highly radioactive nuclea r wastes were injected into the air and carried many miles across the Russian landscape, resulting in the deat hs of several hundred farmers and the permanent evacuatio n of thousands of others. At least two Soviet scienti sts who later emigrated to the free world support this stor y, and there is ample evidence within Soviet scientific pa pers that the release was both massive and widespread. O ne of the scientists, who passed through the area in 1 960, described it as \"an empty land ... no villages, no towns, only chimneys of destroyed homes, no cultivated fie lds or pastures, no herds, no people—nothing.\" 30 Could a nuclear reactor accident happen in the United States? The recent series of incidents at th e Three Mile Island nuclear reactor plant in Harrisburg, Pe nn- sylvania has shaken many people's confidence. And i t is a little disturbing to reflect on the reactors that have already had accidents. There was the NRX reactor at Chalk River, Canada, which melted down, releasing radioactive steam into the air in 1952. Then there was the EBR-1 which melted and leaked radioactive mate- rial at Idaho Falls in 1955. In October of 1957, th e Windscale reactor burst a fuel rod and developed a uranium fire, spewing radioactive gases and dust fo r more than 300 miles across the English countryside. Chalk River suffered another accident in May, 1958, when a fuel rod in the NRU reactor melted and caugh t fire. In 1961, another accident occurred at Idaho F alls when an SL-1 reactor exploded, killing three worker s and releasing radioactive materials into the enviro n- ment. Then there was the Fermi reactor near Detroit which suffered a partial meltdown in October of 196 5, an accident which came under control just before of fi- cials were about to give the order to evacuate the city. 31 No discussion of man-made disasters would be complete without mentioning the dioxin accident at Seveso, Italy, in July of 1976. 32 This town of 17,000 people contained a chemical plant where trichloro- phenol (TCP) was manufactured. (TCP is used to make hexachlorophene for surgical soap.) The disaster be gan when a vat of TCP accidentally overheated and burst , releasing a huge cloud of chemicals which spread ov er the town. It seemed to be a minor inconvenience at first, because although TCP is irritating to the skin, it isn't really dangerous. Unfortunately, overheated TCP changes into dioxin, one of the most poisonous chem i- cals known. People soon became sick. Livestock, pet s, and wildlife died in their tracks. Large sections o f the town had to be evacuated, barricaded, and guarded b y troops to keep people out of the danger zone. Over 1,500 people received continuing medical attention, and 50,000 animals within the danger zone were systemat i- cally killed to keep them from spreading the poison . The crowning blow came when it was discovered that ther e is no known way to decontaminate the town. Dioxin is n ot water soluble, so rain does not touch it. And no or dinary fire is hot enough to destroy it. Burning the buidi ngs would just put the poison into the air again. Dioxi n is so stable that it is not expected to degrade within a human lifetime. The inhabitants have been permanently relocated. A major accident will probably never happen, they say—but the little ones seem to me to have happened all too often. The nuclear accidents, poisonous chemica l spills from trains, dam disasters, and the general lack of foresight shown in hazardous human activities bring s the potential for man-made calamity to a high place on the list of dangers which threaten the average pers on. Which of them are you subject to? Political Disruption As American citizens we tend to take for granted the idea that we have certain basic freedoms which cannot be taken from us, and that the government ha s certain basic obligations which it cannot refuse to carry out. In spite of a certain tendency toward retiring presi- dents early (by vote or by bullet), our government has been pretty stable, and we expect it to stay that w ay. So LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 10"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"why is this section devoted to the dangers of polit ical disruption? I include all kinds of politically inspired attacks on our comfortable way of life (or on our lives) under the title of political disruption. This is a topic abou t which people tend to worry too much, in my opinion, but t here are certain definite possibilities of danger to civ ilization and to ourselves inherent both in big governments a nd in small revolutionary groups. A surprisingly large number of survivalists are con - cerned about a dictatorship taking control in this coun- try. It seems impossible for such a thing to happen here, but on second glance, perhaps there is considerable food for thought in this idea. Historically, democracies have tended to degenerate into dictatorships in times of war or internal turmoil. The dictator does not rise to power in a bloody coup, but is elected to the office by p opular acclaim. He holds out the promise of solving the na tion's problems through firm policies and a restoration of \"law and order.\" A democracy has no defense against a di cta- tor who is placed in office by the people. In this regard, the content of Executive Order 11490 (October 20, 1969) often comes under discussi on. This order provides for the necessary emergency pow ers and continuity of government in the event of a nucl ear attack. Such a provision is sensible and justifiabl e. The cause for concern lies in the fact that the order d oes not explicitly state that it is intended for a nuclear war. It says the President may invoke the emergency powers in \"any national emergency type situation.\" Who decide s what constitutes a national emergency? The Presiden t. Executive Order 11490 contains provisions for the total control of the economy and the suppression of many individual freedoms. It could be liberally int er- preted to allow all of the following policies to be imple- mented: registration and persecution of persons suspected of being enemy or subversive agents; cont rol or confiscation of firearms; arrest of any person t rying to enter or leave the country (remember the \"iron c ur- tain\"); elimination of free enterprise through cont rol of industrial \"priorities,\" resource allotment and eve n out- right confiscation and nationalization of private p rop- erty; control of all communications systems, includ ing radio, television, and telephone in the name of \"na tional security\"; control of all forms of travel, includin g air and highway travel; confiscation of privately owned rad io equipment; censorship of internal mails; seizure of for- eign ships in United States ports; control of the l ending policies of financial institutions; freezing of sto ck and bond prices; and impressment of skilled labor into national service. Some of these provisions are spel led out exactly as I have indicated; others could be so inter- preted by a President determined to undermine the C on- stitution. Before you conclude that such a thing co uld never happen, think back on the abuses of executive power which accompanied the Watergate cover-up. Then remember who signed Executive Order 11490. Nixon. The most likely kind of civil or political disturba nce that the average person might encounter is a large- scale riot such as those occurring in recent years in var ious cities and college campuses around the country. The se have usually been associated with racial troubles o r draft protest. The following titles are a collectio n of headlines generated by one such disturbance. The Mob Increasing in Numbers Encounters Between the Mob and the Military Large Numbers of Rioters Killed Streets Barricaded, Buildings Burned, Stores Sacked, and Private Dwellings Plundered Another Day of Rioting Continuation of Mob Rule Several Soldiers Killed and Wounded Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Actually, these head- lines were drawn from the New York Times, during th e period of July 13 through 17, 1863, more than 115 years ago. The lesson to be learned is that the dra ft and race riots are nothing new, and the fact that they have died down for now does not mean that we have seen t he last of them. Disorganized mob violence is a calami ty which seems to lurk just beneath the surface in man y of our cities, and a hot summer night or a slump in th e economy can be all it takes to set it off. Organized violence against the government is quite another matter. The ranks of political dissidents a nd terrorists in the United States, although small, ar e sur- prisingly well-armed and pose a significant possibi lity of danger to the average citizen. This is not just rig ht-wing propaganda. The potential for large-scale revolutio n is not great, but it is there. When you consider that between 1971 and 1974 over 6,900 combat rifles and 1.1 million rounds of ammunition were stolen from our Army and National Guard armories, you begin to wonder just who has them. It is probable that these weapons were sold for profit to guerillas in other coun- tries, but since they have never been located, the ques- tion remains open. A specialist in terrorism from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency recently told the New York Times that even a small well-trained paramilitary f orce 11 ITS A DISASTER Resistance to the Draft—Rioting and Bloodshed An Armory and a Hotel Destroyed Colored People Assaulted Orphan Asylum Ransacked and Burned Mob Armed with Rifles—They Pick Off Soldiers from the Housetops The Contagion Spreading . . ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"could sabotage the power supply of any large metrop oli- tan area and black out the city for extended period s of time. A five-day blackout in New York, he predicted , would have very serious consequences: Looters would run wild, fires starting at random, a nd jittery National Guardsmen shooting into crowds of panicked people.... Food and water would become scarce, the sanitation system would collapse, and t he rats, which outnumber the people, would be close to achieving a permanent victory. 33 Then there is the problem of home-made atomic bombs. For a long time, scientists were divided on the subject of whether or not it was possible to build an atom bomb with materials available to the public—un til a Princeton physics student designed one as his sen ior thesis. 34 No one would officially admit that the design would work, but he got an A grade. The student didn 't even have to use classified information. Everything he needed was in the library. The only actual material he could not have obtained legally was the plutonium. Where would a terrorist get weapons-grade pluto- nium? Well, first of all there are \"tens of tons\" o f the dangerous metal missing and unaccounted for in government processing plants. Most of this is almos t certainly stuck inside pipes, but if thirteen pound s (enough for a Hiroshima-size bomb) were missing, no one would ever know. Of course it wouldn't really be necessary to build a bomb when there are so many around to steal. At one point, the United States owned about 40,000 tactica l nuclear weapons small enough to carry off in a car. These were scattered in warehouses and on board shi ps all over the world. Consider the inventory problem. If the military inventory is 99.9 percent efficient—an unheard of level of reliability—that still leaves f orty bombs unaccounted for. Most of these are just mis- placed, in the wrong room or on the wrong shelf, bu t we can't be certain that one or two aren't in irrespon sible hands. The CIA has been understandably concerned about terrorist weapons, and although officials admit tha t a terrorist atom bomb is possible, they think an atta ck using chemical, biological, or radiological weapons would be more likely. 35 A radiological weapon is a radioactive substance, such as plutonium, sprayed i nto the air as a mist. Anybody who breathes it dies of radiation sickness a few weeks later. There is no treatment. I don't think that many of us are in any danger fro m these possible attacks. The question which bothers me is the over-reaction by the government which may follo w such an incident. We have already seen signs of thi s in the over-reaction of United States intelligence age ncies to the imagined \"threat\" of student dissidents in t he Vietnam protests. A recent Senate investi gation LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 12 revealed that the FBI had created over 500,000 file s on potential \"security risks,\" and that the CIA had op ened a third of a million first-class letters in trackin g down these domestic demonstrators in spite of the fact t hat no communist link to the demonstrations was ever found . I was particularly interested in the FBI's list of 26 ,000 Americans who should be \"rounded up\" in case of national emergency because they might cause trouble . 36 Terrorism is based on the idea that if the authorit ies can be forced to lose their nerve, they may take co unter- measures that will be unacceptable to private citiz ens, who then join the ranks of the revolutionaries. Thi s kind of reaction does take place, as I can personally te stify. During the Vietnam college campus demonstrations in the spring of 1970, I was a struggling undergraduat e at UCLA trying to pass some very difficult classes in calcu- lus, physics, chemistry, and biology. Neither my fr iends nor I had any time for what we regarded as harmless fun-and-games on the lawn, where some scruffy liber al arts students assembled each day to march around an d wave signs. Then one day I walked out of UCLA's 3.5 million volume research library into a scene right out of a nightmare. Police in body armor were chasing unarmed students and beating them to the ground wit h clubs when they caught them. A riot-control squad h ad been loosed on campus, and, in a punitive display o f force, they simply broke every head they could reac h. I quickly returned to the library and stayed there un til the battle was over. After that, though, I had a lot of trouble controlling my attitude toward the police. It took sev- eral years before I began to regard policemen as pe ople again. I am a basically conservative person, but th e over-reaction and brutality I witnessed strongly sh ifted my approval toward the demonstrators. Imagine what happened with the more liberal elements on campus. The point is that the basic principle of terrorism works, and it could have effects on our lives which would go far beyond the bombing of a few buildings. If it is the goal of terrorists to provoke excessiv e retaliation and police-state activities, then they are already beginning to succeed in the United States, in spite of the fact that next to nothing has happened here. A recent Harris poll showed that 60 percent of all Amer- icans feel terrorism is a major problem in this cou ntry, and 55 percent would favor the formation of a speci al police unit with powers to investigate, capture and exe- cute suspected terrorist leaders and all members of their groups without a trial. 37 With so little encouragement, half of us would be willing to create a modern Amer ican Gestapo unit. If you are still thinking \"That kind of thing could never happen here,\" think again. During World War I I, over 100,000 innocent United States citizens were herded into concentration camps without trial on th e suspicion that they might be enemy agents. 38 The basis"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"for the suspicion was that these Americans had Orie ntal faces. The camps were in California. Their inaliena ble rights as American citizens were completely ignored . Your rights could be ignored just as easily if the political climate were right. If the power in your city was shut off for several days, could you do without it? Could you survive th e resulting riots? Would you vote for a proponent of \"law and order?\" How do you feel about imprisonment or execution without trial? How about Executive Order 11490? The potential for political disruption in th e Uni- ted States is real, and although we may hope it wil l not occur, we cannot ignore the possibility. Economic Crisis I think it is fair to say that if you were to make a list of the top ten leading survivalists, as many as sev en would be former economists and investment counselor s. The fear that the stock market will crash and the e con- omy will collapse is strong among these men, and co n- sidering their credentials, the possibility of econ omic chaos should be considered carefully. I ought to mention, however, that my personal attitude toward the field of economics is somewhat unenlightened. I regard economics as an occult reli gion complete with mystics, gurus, totems, taboos, and s acri- fices to the gods. I ran a private survey of articl es in the New York Times for the last two years and concluded that economic predictions are usually wrong. Foreca sts of economic collapse in survivalist literature are com- mon, and most are painfully overdue. The \"crash of '79\" used to be the \"crash of '76,\" and before that it w as the \"crash of '73.\" Someday the economic doomsayers wil l be right, but few will know it in advance. What could go wrong with the economy? The con- cern here lies with problems relating to inflation and banking. We'll examine inflation first. Inflation i s the gradual loss of value which happens to a nation's c ur- rency when the government starts meeting its debts by printing paper money without having enough silver o r gold to back it up. The new money does legally pay the debt, but it has no value. The effect is to dilute the value of money already in circulation. As the process goe s on, prices begin to rise to compensate for the falling value of the money. This has been happening in our country f or many years. Isn't a dollar still worth a dollar? Well, let's se e. A 1979 one dollar bill is supposed to have the same v alue as four 1979 quarters, which in turn ought to be equal to four 1960 quarters. But it doesn't work that way. I f you suspend your faith in the figure \"$1.00,\" you sudde nly realize that a 1979 dollar bill is not redeemable f or gold or silver. Its intrinsic value is about one-tenth o f a cent. Even if you tried to redeem it for gold, you wouldn 't get much. The United States has only a few cents worth of gold in Fort Knox for every dollar in circulation. The 1979 quarters are big copper pennies plated except at the edge, where the copper shows through. They have a real value of about six cents each, in terms of their metal—or about sixty times as much as the bill. (The new 1979 \"silver\" dollars are the same size—an d value—as these copper quarters.) A 1960 quarter, ho w- ever, is made of silver and is now worth four times its face value. That makes a 1960 quarter worth (in ter ms of intrinsic value) twenty 1979 quarters or 1,250 doll ars in 1979 bills. Is a dollar still worth a dollar? Of course, if you go out to the store right now to spend your one dollar bill, your four new quarters, and your four old quarters, you will receive equal valu e for them. Why? Because we still live under the convenie nt fiction that \"a dollar is a dollar.\" But as inflati on con- tinues, our money will begin to lose its value more and more quickly. There are many examples in history of currency like ours which became worthless in the sp ace of a few months as people lost faith in it. The classic example of hyper-inflation, cited in most economics textbooks, is that of Germany during 1923. Inflation was completely out of control due t o the post-war government's attempts to spend all the pap er money it could print. (There wasn't much in the tre asury following the German defeat in World War I.) The German people were very alarmed about this inflatio n, which was forcing prices to double every month duri ng the early part of the year. By the end of the year, prices were doubling every week, and finally they began to double every day. When the system finally collapsed , the cost of living had risen to a point 700 million tim es the pre-war level. Factories paid employees two or thre e times a day so workers could hurry out to spend the ir wages before the bills lost too much value. Some co m- panies paid their workers by giving them the mercha n- dise they produced. The workers would then spend th e evening trying to barter their goods for food. Peop le on fixed incomes or living on their savings were total ly unable to obtain goods and services. Between Octobe r and December of 1923, there were over forty food ri ots in major German cities. This pattern has been repea ted fifteen times in recorded history, and it has never been successfully opposed. Some economists suspect that there is no practical way to halt this inflationary spiral, and that the United States dollar may soon go the w ay of the mark. Time will tell. The second area of weakness in the economy involves the nation's banks. Banks operate under another convenient fiction: the idea that depositor s can withdraw their money at any time. When depositors l ose faith in that idea, they rush to withdraw their mon ey and the bank fails. How does this happen? If you ignore the fancy economic terms and legal restrictions, the operation of a bank is absurdly s imple. Imagine this situation: you deposit a dollar in you r 13 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"savings account. The bank then lends your dollar to another person, who opens an account and deposits t he dollar back in the bank. Then the bank lends the do llar to another person, who probably will also deposit t he dollar back in the bank. Under Federal Reserve Boar d rules, United States banks can lend four different people the same dollar. Now you and four other people each think you have a dollar in the bank, but there is o nly one dollar. What will the bank do if you all show up at the same time to withdrawn \"your\" dollar? One of you ge ts paid, and other others go without—and the bank fail s. It gets worse. In the preceding situation, the bor- rowers would eventually repay their loans, at least in theory, and you would be the only person with a cla im on that much-used dollar you originally deposited. But what if one of those borrowers defaults on the loan ? In that case, you and the other three borrowers have b een robbed. The dollar isn't there any more. If you try to withdraw it, the bank may have to close its doors. On a much grander scale, this is the position of ou r nation's largest banks. They have been lending bill ions of dollars to third world countries which have not paid back the money. This has put the banks in a shaky position. They have to make the loans look good, or their depositors will panic. To avoid the image of insol- vency, therefore, the banks have lent additional mo ney to the defaulting countries so they can at least pa y the interest on the previous loans. That way the banks don't have to admit that the loans are bad. It looks good on paper, but it leaves the banks very vulnerable to a loss of faith among their depositors. If one of the nation' s biggest banks should suffer a rumor of approaching failure, the rumor could actually cause the failure . Natu- rally, when one bank fails, rumors start immediatel y about other banks. The outcome of this cycle will b e left as an exercise for the reader's imagination. If one of these calamities develops in the next few years, as many people expect, we might find ourselv es thrown on our own resources for a period of time ra ng- ing from a few weeks to several years. Maybe it won 't get that bad. We could get lucky. Economic doomsayers a re usually wrong in the short term, but in the long ru n they will probably be right. If you suddenly find one mo rning that your bank has failed, your business has closed , and your money is worthless, how will you feed your fam ily? Thermonuclear War The last kind of disaster I am going to discuss is one that has never taken place at all: a full-scale the rmonu- clear war. Of all the potential disasters imaginabl e, nuclear war is both the greatest possible catastrop he our nation could ever face and the most immediate and continuous threat to each of our lives. I have save d nuclear war for the end of this chapter because suc h a war will produce its own version of every other kin d of LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 14 disaster. Nuclear war represents every danger to ma n- kind rolled up into one event. Most of the people with whom I have discussed nuclear war seem to think that they already underst and everything about it. The general idea seems to be t hat one of these days some idiot will \"push the button\" and the whole world will go up in radioactive smoke. Ac tu- ally, most people's ignorance of the reality of nuc lear conflict is as great as their ignorance of the far side of the moon. They know it is there, and as far as they're concerned that's enough to know about it. The only question which people routinely ask me is, exactly how likely is such a conflict? They seem to have convinced themselves that the opportunities for a nuclear war occur very rarely and can be safely ign ored, but they still want to hear words of assurance from an \"expert.\" Unfortunately, this is one of those parad oxical situations where the event is, oddly, both unlikely and certain to happen sooner or later. How likely is a full-scale nuclear war? Attempts have been made in the past to assign a definite pro babil- ity to it, but time has shown the prophets to have been embarrassingly wrong, and it is currently the unspo ken policy of nuclear arms experts to avoid the questio n. Even so, if you can sit still for a little math, I would like to illustrate something that is very disturbing abo ut the \"probability\" of nuclear war. One facet of training to be a scientist is studying the art of statistical inference. Perhaps the most inte resting thing this subject teaches one is what happens to v ery small, insignificant probabilities when they are co m- pounded year after year. For instance, I once read an estimate by a knowledgeable man who \"guessed\" that the probability of having a nuclear war was one cha nce in fifty for any given year. One chance in fifty me ans a 98 percent chance of not having a war during the year. You have to admit that this estimate sounds pretty reas sur- ing. Of course thereat probability of war is unknow n; it changes every time a new world leader comes into po wer or a new weapon is developed. The estimate of one chance out of fifty, however, will be sufficient to illus- trate my point. Starting in any particular year, and knowing that there is a 98 percent chance of peace each year, wh at is the probability that peace will continue for five y ears? To find out, you change the 98 percent figure to th e form 0.98, and multiply it by itself five times. Th is gives you the probability that there will be peace in the first year, and the second year, and the third year, and the fourth year, and the fifth year. We write this as ( 0.98) 5 , which equals 0.90, or a 90 percent chance that peac e will continue for five years from the starting date. The prob- ability of peace for any length of time can be comp uted in this manner. Table 1 gives this probability for several warless"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"periods of time. What this table shows is that even though the probability of peace in any one year is assumed to be very high, a person's chance of livin g to a ripe old age without seeing a war are very small. I f there is only one chance in fifty of having a war during any year, there is still a 78 percent probability (four chances out of five) that there will be a war within the sp an of an average person's life. TABLE 1 Probability of Consecutive Years of Peace _______ YEARS _________ PROBABILITY IN PERCENT 1 98 5 90 10 81 25 60 50 36 ________ 75 _________________________ 22 ______________ The exercise assumes that the probability of peace is 0.98 in any particular year. The false confidence inspired by a low probability of disaster simply encourages us to allow the risk to continue year after year. The end result of such a policy is inescapable. If we continue to give this calamit y repeated opportunities to take place, eventually a war will come. Under these circumstances, the advent of nuclear war can be regarded as a certainty. Only th e date is unpredictable. The fact that the date is \"unpredictable\" doesn't mean that no one is trying to predict it, however. R. E. McMaster's Cycles of War: The Next Six Years is a recent review of various war prediction schemes whi ch raises some interesting possibilities. 39 It is thought pro- voking to discover that several independent war pre dic- tion methods seem to point to a major war in the ea rly 1980s. These methods are based on cyclic developmen ts which precede important wars and are drawn from our nation's political, literary, and economic history. None of them are reliable enough to take seriously, but it gives one pause to find that predictors agree about the p oten- tial danger of the next few years. One factor which obviously influences the proba- bility of nuclear war is the attitude and posture o f the \"other side.\" We can assume that the Soviets do not want such a war, although they do seem to be well prepared to meet it. The fact that the USSR devotes an entire branch of its armed services to civil defens e is only one indication. But the assumption that the Russian s don't want a nuclear war does not rule out the poss ibility that they would sternly back a nuclear bluff if the y thought they could get away with it. After all, we have humiliated them several times in the past in just s uch a manner. Revenge might be sweet for the Kremlin. Could the Soviets win a showdown confrontation? Table 2 shows a partial summary of United States an d Soviet military forces based on figures drawn from the popular press and government publications. The exac t number and precise definition of each kind of weapo n can be argued, of course, but the figures are essen tially correct. In the last few years, the USSR has been b uild- ing up its military might while we have been retiri ng ours. Through inaction, the United States has lost its superior position in the balance of power, and it i s only a matter of time before we see how the Soviets will e xploit their new advantage. We can rest assured, I think, that they will exploit it. How would a nuclear war get started? The popular myth of the insane general with a finger on the but ton is pretty far from reality, but something like it did happen during the Nixon administration. The President, har - ried by the Watergate investigation, remarked to so me members of Congress, \"I can go into my office and p ick up the telephone and in twenty-five minutes 70 mill ion people will be dead.\" This remark sparked a great d eal of concern and a special Congressional investigation i nto the mechanism of command and control over this coun - try's nuclear weapons. Before the investigation cou ld convene, Defense Secretary Schlesinger quietly told his staff that any unusual orders from the White House should not be honored until he had personally exami ned them. This was a prudent action under the circumsta n- ces, since the Secretary was worried about a possib le military coup, but it was also quite illegal. The d anger of an insane President (the person occupying the most stressful job in the world) cannot be dismissed. 40 At the international level, there are several ways in which a nuclear war could start. Serious students o f the subject can list over a dozen possibilities: 41 1. We might one day get a false alarm from our early warning radar systems and launch a mistaken retalia - tion, forcing the Soviets to launch a real counter- attack. 2. There is the \"crazy general\" or \"crazy President\" possibility. Nuclear war might be ordered for no rational reason. 3. True mechanical or human error might launch one or more missiles. 4. A limited war might uncontrollably escalate. A NATO-Soviet armed conflict in Europe, for example, could spring up in which neutron weapons would be used, then small tactical nukes, then larger ones, then... 5. The rationality of irrationality might overwhelm logic. What if the Soviets put on a big show, sayin g that if we don't back down they'll blow us up? They might think that if they sound crazy enough, other 15 IT’S A DISASTER YEARS PROBABILITY IN PERCENT 1 98 5 90 10 81 25 60 50 36 75 22"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"TABLE 2 US and Soviet Strategic Forces WEAPON CATEGORY US USSR Intercontinental ballistic missiles Submarine-launched ballistic missiles Anti-missile missiles Strategic bombers Interceptors (Anti-bomber) Surface-to-air missiles (Anti-bomber) Tanks Naval combat ships SOURCE: Chiefly Bill Sweetman and Bill Gunston, Sov iet Air Power (New York: Crescent Books, 1978). 1,450 800+ 65 8,000 200 2,600 12,000 50,000 250 countries would beg us to be reasonable and we'd back down.

No matter how well the system would really work, it's lots better than anything we have. What if someone decides that they can go through a nuclear war without suffering too much damage? Tens of millions of Russians were lost in the two world wars. The loss of the same number in World War III might not seem too high a price to pay. 7. One of the worst possibilities is that one side wil l fear that the other is about to attack and will try to s hoot first. The advantages of a first strike are so grea t that in a crisis it could well seem the best thing to do if other prospects look poor. 8. We might launch the missiles at the Soviets as part of a pact to aid an ally under attack, or vice vers a. 9. A variety of crises, such as the election of an ext reme right-wing hawk to the Presidency might convince th e Soviets to attack rather than wait for us to do so. 10. If one side gained a definite lead in the arms race , it might feel that it was time to launch a full-scale attack before the other side could catch up. Such a situat ion may develop between 1982 and 1986, when the Soviets will have the capability to destroy our lan d- based missiles in a single strike. Our new MX missi le system will not yet be completed. 11. An ambitious dictator with nuclear weapons might start a war to further his own designs. (Remem- ber Hitler?) 12. An ambitious third nation, such as China, might decide to launch simultaneous attacks on the United States and the USSR, hoping that the two powers would retaliate against each other. The third natio n could then rule over the rubble. 13. A desperate third nation (as Israel could be if it were about to lose a final war with the Arabs) might fak e a nuclear attack on itself in order to draw us more actively into the conflict. Experts seem to agree that for the time being, the most likely form of nuclear war is a small one betw een two minor powers. As proliferation continues, small er and smaller countries are developing their own atom ic weapons, and before long the world will certainly h ave to deal with petty dictators lobbing radioactive ma te- rials at one another. It has even been suggested th at such governments might try the ultimate in international affrontery—using their crude bombs on major powers. 42 Most people could name the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 as two times when the United States threatened to use its nuclear str ike force against the Soviet Union, but few are aware o f the total extent to which the rival powers constantly threaten one another through the time-honored activ ity of \"sabre-rattling.\" In the period between 1946 and 1975, the United States used its armed forces for \" politi- cal purposes\" (bluffing) a total of 215 times. The Soviet incidents during the same period numbered 115. This averages out to about one incident per month over t hirty years. Of course, most of these events were fairly minor, such as the time a United States missile submarine paid a diplomatic visit to Turkey, incidentally demonstrat ing that there were United States subs within striking range of Moscow. Other incidents ranged in seriousness fr om Soviet overflights of the West German border to the Red Army's sealing off Berlin. United States and Soviet warships regularly harass one another at sea, with Soviet bombers circling over American aircraft carr iers, the bombers themselves closely escorted by United States fighters. The game of \"chicken\" even extends to undersea operations, where it has led to nine colli sions between United States submarines and Soviet naval vessels of various kinds. In total, there have been nineteen incidents in whi ch the United States has deployed strategic nuclear st rike forces in order to underline some message to the So viets. Any of them might have been interpreted by the Sovi ets as a hostile move. In addition, there are people wh o maintain that we have offered atomic weapons to all ies from time to time when they seemed to need them.

What wil l happen to us if a full scale nuclear war somehow do es get started in the next few years? During the initial bombing, our cities will be swep t by shock waves and winds that dwarf even those pro- duced by hurricanes and tornadoes. Fallout will con fine people indoors much longer and more certainly than any blizzard. Fires will burn unopposed through cit ies, forests, and fields until nature extinguishes them. The erosion which will follow the fires, as well as tha t which will take place on temporarily abandoned farmlands, may permanently degrade much of our agricultural ba se and contribute to widespread flooding. Famine will follow because the war will make gaso- line, insecticide, and fertilizer unavailable to fa rmers. Many fields, some with ripening crops, will be heav ily contaminated with fallout and will be unusable. The nuclear explosions will inject as much dust into th e air as a major volcanic explosion, cooling the earth and s hort- ening our growing seasons. Transportation facilitie s will be shattered, preventing what food is produced from reaching markets. Starving people will try to eat natural foods but will not know how to do so. Riots will follow. Medical personnel, equipment, and supplies, which are found mainly in cities, will be in short supply after the cities are attacked. Sanitation will fail in ma ny areas, contaminating the water and encouraging rats. Refug ee camps will be perfect breeding grounds for dangerou s diseases. Although many survivors will try to help one another, many will band together to prey on others. By far the easiest way to obtain food and supplies in the post-attack period will be to take them from the we ak. Then there are the nightmares brought about by nuclear war that exceed even nature's limits, such as the destruction of the ozone layer of the atmosphere, p ro- ducing a drastic increase in ultraviolet light. Cau casians will have to cover up when they go outside or suffe r a blistered sunburn in a few minutes. And then there are the problems of genetic damage, cancer, and radiati on sickness. 44 Pretty horrible, right? I tried to make it sound th at way. Believe it or not, even a nuclear war is survivable . With an eye toward realistic preparation, you can s ee to it that your family and a small group of friends wi ll be able to live through the holocaust and the post-att ack period with a minimum of unpleasantness. All you ha ve to do is give it a determined try. This book tells you how. Commentary Since the time this chapter was written, many of th e unpleasant forecasts 1 have made have come true. In the first six months of 1979, we had a truckers' strike which slowed down the transportation of food to many stor es. There was an outbreak of polio in Pennsylvania, the largest in recent years. (As I write these words, a radio news program informs me of a small bubonic plague outbreak in southern California.) A pack of rats be came bold enough to attack a woman on a New York street (less than two blocks from the City Hall). A blizza rd in Colorado knocked out electrical service to 250,000 peo- ple in Colorado Springs, while another storm deposi ted ice over Michigan, breaking power lines, making hig h- ways impassable and isolating 230,000 people in col d homes. Then there were the spring floods, which for ced 15,000 people from their homes in Alabama and Missi s- sippi. Several flurries of tornadoes struck the Mid west, including one episode which left 44 dead and over 6 00 injured in Wichita Falls, Texas. A train derailment in Florida forced 5,000 people to flee from advancing clouds of yellow sulphur fumes. (That was after the acetone tank-cars stopped exploding.) On the politi cal front, the Senate approved 2.1 billion dollars for devel- opment of the MX missile, a land-based mobile weapo n designed to elude a Soviet surprise attack. I don't view this as a positive development, from either the mil itary or the economic point of view. Then there was the ominous incident at Middle- town, Pennsylvania. The Three Mile Island nuclear power plant experienced the worst reactor accident yet, caused by an unbelievable combination of poor desig n and human error. Badly overworked technicians acci- dentally closed the valves which supplied the react or with emergency cooling water. The main cooling syst em subsequently failed. When the emergency system didn 't work, heat and pressure built up in the reactor cor e. The operators didn't know how hot the reactor had becom e because the computer which monitored the condition of the core was not calibrated for temperatures more t han 100 degrees above normal. It just typed out \"?????\" in- stead of the temperature. A misleading gauge made reactor technicians think that the core was covered by cooling water when it was actually partially expose d. The company had known that the gauge could cause 17 ITS A DISASTER"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"such a mistake but had not bothered to replace it. The pressure building up in the core should have been r e- leased by a special valve—which failed to open. It hadn't been replaced after a previous failure. Pressure ba cked up and forced radioactive water out on to the floor of the containment building. The water should have been safely confined within the building, but the buildi ng's sump pumps automatically started up and pumped the water outside to holding tanks. The pumps were sup- posed to be automatically disabled during an emer- gency. When the holding tanks filled up, the pumps kept right on pumping—spilling contaminated water on the ground. For survivalists, there are two important lessons heie. The first is illustrated by the fact that one backup system after another failed in rapid succession fol lowing an initial emergency caused by human carelessness. This is characteristic of the way in which massive \"fail -safe\" systems finally do fail. I think this point applies directly to nuclear weapons as well as to nuclear power. The second lesson involves official response to the cri sis. Virtually all of the information local residents co uld obtain came through the national news media. It too k the power company thirty-six hours to get around to informing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that there had been a hydrogen explosion within the containment building, a key piece of evidence that the reactor core was badly damaged. The NRC members described themselves as operating \"in the blind\" du ring the crisis. They thought they should order an evacu a- tion, but they didn't know if it was necessary—or already too late. The lesson to survivalists is cle ar: Don't wait for the official evacuation order. Such orders fre- quently don't come in time to save anyone. The Thre e Mile Island incident spurred a probe into emergency evacuation plans in general. Federal experts conclu ded that of the forty-three states which have nuclear p ower plants, only twenty-five of them have evacuation pl ans which would work. Of the twenty-five plans, only ni ne have been properly tested. Some of the others inclu de embarrassing oversights such as using school buses to transport residents out of town—leaving children stranded at school. Last but not least, let me remind you of the gas crunch. Subsequent to the political upheaval in Ira n, United States crude oil supplies diminished, appare ntly giving the oil companies an excuse to press for pri ce deregulation. In some parts of the country people b egan to have trouble getting gasoline, and two to six ho ur waits in line at the gas pump became common. Ration - ing schemes were proposed, and California went on a n \"odd-even\" system, which required that service stat ion attendants refuse to serve anyone whose license pla te number was at variance with the date. The ominous p art was the official effort to prevent private gasoline storage by making it illegal to fill a gas can larger than two gallons, and allowing only one can to a customer at that. When an emergency strikes, it really pays to be rea dy ahead of time. This goal, to be ready for the emergency ahead of time, is the reason this book was written. Governme nt agencies have a lamentable tendency to do too littl e, too late when danger threatens a community, making sur- vival a do-it-yourself proposition. It is my greatest wish that you will never need the information presented here. If you are forced to pu t this book to the test, however, I hope it will prove ade quate. Never forget that every emergency ends eventually. If you hang on long enough, you will see the new dawn. Even on the day after doomsday. Notes 1. E. C.

LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 20"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2 Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Nuclear War I HAVE DESIGNED the survival information in this book to include material appropriate to a wide rang e of disasters, including political and economic ones, b ut the fact remains that my primary purpose is to address the topic of surviving a nuclear war. I am convinced th at a group which is prepared to survive a nuclear war is fully capable of handling any other kind of crisis, too. But to withstand the stresses of nuclear weapons you first have to understand exactly what you will be up against. The purpose of this chapter is to provide factual infor mation upon which to base your plans. Please do not skip this section. It is vitally impo r- tant that you understand this material for three re asons. The first is that much of what you have learned abo ut nuclear war from disarmament spokesmen, science fic - tion novels, and Hollywood films is flatly untrue. This includes every so-called \"scientific proof that sur vival is impossible. The second reason is that there are leg iti- mate survival problems posed by nuclear weapons of which you may never have heard. Obviously, the thir d reason is that if your basic information is faulty, your precautions will be faulty too. You will have to su rvive the reality of nuclear war, not the legend. 1 A note to the reader: In writing this chapter I hav e relied heavily on The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, edited by Samuel Glasstone, as well as several Defe nse Civil Preparedness Agency (DCPA) manuals and text- books. 2 I found that there is very little agreement among them regarding the danger radii of nuclear weapons effects, including fallout patterns. Usually I have been able to trace the discrepancies to errors made by t he DCPA writers, and therefore I have generally followe d Glasstone. Be warned that the reference books you ha ve been using in your planning could be seriously in e rror. How Nuclear Weapons Work The explosive effect of nuclear weapons comes from the instantaneous liberation of fantastic amou nts of energy. The energy released is derived either fr om the process of fission or from a combination of fission and fusion processes. Without getting bogged down in to o many details, these processes can be explained as follows. Fission is the splitting of a large atom (of uraniu m or plutonium) that occurs when it is hit by a neutr on. A neutron is a particle of matter which is usually fo und resting peacefully in an atom's central nucleus. On rare occasions, however, certain unstable heavy atoms in a block of plutonium or uranium will suddenly split u p into various fragments, among which are two or thre e speeding neutrons. If the block of uranium or pluto nium metal is large enough, these liberated neutrons wil l smack into other atoms, splitting them and releasin g even more neutrons. Since each neutron liberates tw o or three others (and lots of energy) the process rapid ly builds up to fantastic proportions. The result is a n atomic bomb like the one used in Hiroshima in 1945. Fusion is quite a different process. The basic idea of fusion is to take two extremely light atoms of hydr ogen and smash them together hard enough to combine them into one heavier atom of helium. Once again, the pr ocess liberates neutrons and fantastic amounts of energy. On a pound-for-pound basis, the fusion of hydrogen produ - ces about three times as much energy as the fission of plutonium. That is why most of our missiles today h ave hydrogen warheads (H-bombs). The only practical way to get the hydrogen atoms to fuse is to heat them up to temperatures in the rang e of several million degrees, and the only way to do tha t is to use a uranium or plutonium fission bomb as a detona - tor. An H-bomb is constructed by enclosing a standa rd fission bomb in a mantle of hydrogen (in the form o f \"heavy\" water). When the fission bomb explodes, it heats the hydrogen up to the point where fusion can occur. There is usually an additional external jacket of 21 EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"uranium around the core of the H-bomb, too. This makes the explosion even bigger, because the neutro ns from the fusion of hydrogen produce a second wave o f fission when they strike the uranium jacket. This f ission- fusion-fission arrangement is the standard design f or a thermonuclear weapon. (\"Thermo\" refers to the heat required to set off the hydrogen fusion process.) Now suppose you had a very small H-bomb (1 kiloton) all set and ready to go with a fission bom b inside, a layer of hydrogen around it, and an outer jacket of uranium enclosing the whole thing. What would yo u get if you stripped off the outer jacket? In that case you would have a tiny thermonuclear warhead with some of its punch removed, obviously, but you would also have a bomb that releases a burst of high-energy neutrons. In a normal H-bomb, these neu - trons would have been used to cause fission in the ura- nium jacket, but in this neutron bomb there is no j acket to contain them. This is important. The terrible an d frightening neutron bomb is really just a regular H - bomb with a lot of its explosive power removed. It' s not anything new, and it is certainly no more terrible than the weapon that gave it birth. In spite of this, th ere has been a loud outcry about building it for possible u se in western Europe. For some reason people would rather have NATO use the much more destructive hydrogen warheads. This isn't sensible, because the neutron weapons ar e tiny and very clean. One 1-kiloton neutron bomb can only stop ten Soviet tanks. The 2,000 neutron bombs necessary to stop all of the 20,000 Red Army tanks now stationed in East Germany would produce no fallout and very little blast damage to the defended territ ory. Normal nuclear weapons would ravage the continent. Size and Type of Burst Nuclear weapons can be detonated in all kinds of circumstances. They can be exploded in the air over a target, on the surface of the ground, under the gro und (in a mine), under water, and at such high altitude s that the burst effectively occurs in space. Each of thes e loca- tions alters the effects produced by the blast and other phenomena, making the location of the bomb at the moment of detonation one of the most important fac- tors in predicting the problems it will cause for r etreat- ers. We will be concerned with surface bursts, air bursts, and high-altitude bursts. Underground explosions an d water bursts are not likely in an attack. Nuclear weapons are described in terms of the amount of TNT it would take to produce an equivalen t explosion. Usually, the nuclear weapon is equal to many thousands or millions of tons of TNT, and is referr ed to as a kiloton (thousand ton) or megaton (million ton ) weapon. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was approx- imately a 20-kiloton weapon. The largest ever built for an experimental explosion was a 57-megaton devi ce. Nuclear weapons in present use range from 20-megato n \"city busters\" to kiloton and sub-kiloton tactical weapons. The important thing to remember about variations in size of nuclear warheads is that the damage done does not increase in proportion to the size of the bomb. An increase in explosive power by a factor often produ ces, at most, a doubling of the radius of damage. This f act is not widely known; lack of awareness accounts for ma ny of the wild-eyed estimates of the damage which coul d be caused by \"super-bombs.\" The Guinness Book of World Records, for instance, reports that a 100-megaton b omb would make a crater 19 miles across. 3 This figure repre- sents 100 times the 0.19 mile diameter of a 1-megat on blast in rock. The potential size of a 100-megaton crater in rock is really only 0.8 miles in diameter. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to discuss the effects of a 1-megaton bomb and a 10-megaton bomb. These two sizes effectively span the range of weapo ns the Soviets may use on us, and even in the case of larg er or smaller weapons, the differences will not be so gre at as to invalidate plans and precautions based on these esti- mates. Don't let anybody scare you with tall tales of 50,000-megaton \"continent busters.\" Once you get ov er 50 megatons, the radius of damage expands very litt le with increases in bomb size. This is undoubtedly th e reason that neither side has tried to build a world - shattering bomb. That, and the fact that we all hav e to share the same world. Description of Air and Surface Bursts When a nuclear weapon is exploded, the incredible amount of energy released instantaneously heats a l arge volume of air to a temperature of tens of millions of degrees. The white-hot air radiates heat intensely and gives off so much light that a 1-megaton fireball l ooks brighter than the sun even when viewed from a dista nce of 50 miles. The flash in the sky from a relatively small 100-kiloton burst is visible from as much as 400 mi les away at night. (If the attack comes after dark, the re won't be much question about which nearby cities ha ve been hit.) At the instant of detonation, the fireball of a 1- megaton bomb is about 400 feet in diameter. It then begins to expand rapidly until, ten seconds after t he explosion, it is 5,700 feet across. Like a hot-air balloon, the fireball is buoyed up into the air at a rate of 300 feet per second. After about a minute, the fireball has risen to 25,000 feet and has cooled to the point that it is no longer giving off any light. As the cloud of superheated gas rises, it experienc es a certain amount of drag from the surrounding air. This slows down the outer edges of the cloud, allowing t he inner part to rise a little faster than the outer p art. The LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 22"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"total effect is the formation of what amounts to a smoke ring as the lagging outer rim of the cloud is sucke d into the space left by the rising center section. This r olling smoke ring is the fabled \"mushroom,\" which sits on top of a \"stem\" formed by a column of windblown smoke and dirt carried up behind the rising fireball. It has become fashionable to regard the mushroom cloud as a symbol of horror, but there was a brief time when the towering atomic cloud was regarded with aw e and admiration. Admittedly, the time was a short on e. Before the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, wit- nesses to the first atomic explosion described the mush- room cloud as the most awesome and beautiful thing they had ever seen. They talked about it as a rolli ng, glowing cloud giving off all the colors of the rain bow, with lightning bolts flickering all around it. We d on't normally think of mushroom clouds as being dancing visions of loveliness, partly because the films we have seen of air bursts are not usually in color, and pa rtly because we know now what the mushroom cloud means in terms of human suffering. At first the gases of the mushroom cloud are red or reddish-brown because of a high concentration of oxides of nitrogen. These compounds are formed any time air is heated and are most familiar in automob ile emissions which form smog. The yellow color of thic k smog is a very pale version of the color of a newly formed mushroom cloud. (The production of such grea t quantities of oxides of nitrogen in the mushroom cl oud represents a very significant threat to surivival p lanners, a fact which we will discuss in detail later in the chapter.) After a while the cloud cools down to normal air te mper- ature and the water vapor in it condenses and forms droplets. At this point the reddish color disappear s and the cloud turns white. At a certain point, the cloud stops rising and begi ns to spread out into a flatter shape. When it finally stops growing, the nuclear cloud is very impressive in te rms of size. A cloud from a 1-megaton burst is typically t welve miles high and twelve miles across. For a 10-megato n burst, the cloud is about twenty miles high and as much as fifty miles across. Shock Wave Effects Acting on the principle that retreaters aren't as interested in how the shock wave forms as they are in what happens to the surrounding countryside, I am going to skip the technical details of wave front f orma- tion and stick to the basic idea that a nuclear det onation produces a powerful shock wave in the air. This sho ck wave moves out in all directions from the fireball at a speed faster than sound. What are the pertinent det ails a retreater needs to understand about this effect? Probably the most difficult thing to grasp about th e blast wave is that it is actually composed of two e ffects which happen at once. The first effect is called ov erpres- sure, and consists of a drastic increase in air pre ssure above the normal level. This increase in air pressu re tends to crush hollow objects (like houses or cars) , pro- ducing an effect something like squeezing a beer ca n in your fist. The second effect is dynamic pressure, w hich produces a very strong wind blowing outward from th e center of the explosion. This wind tends to knock t hings down, like slapping that beer can and sending it fl ying across the room. Together, the overpressure and the dynamic pressure are the effects which are loosely re- ferred to as the blast wave. The blast wave has many effects which are of inter- est to retreat planning. Obviously, one effect is d irect injury to people. Others include damage to building s, vehicles, shelters, and various objects that could block a retreater's escape route. Table 3 gives a summary o f these blast effects. This table calls for a few words of explanation. Parked private airplanes are very delicate and can be made unflyable by overpressures in the 0.5 to 1.0 p ounds per square inch (psi) range occurring as far away a s twenty-one miles from a 1-megaton explosion. If you plan to fly to safety after an attack, you had bett er pick an airport a long way from the nearest target as yo ur starting point. If you are anywhere near a target when the bomb goes off, the last thing you want to do is to stand next to a window and watch. At extreme ranges, the shock wa ve may not arrive for two or three minutes. Window gla ss is almost as sensitive to overpressure as the sheet me tal in airplanes, and when glass shatters it forms thousan ds of razor-sharp missiles which shower into the room. Within 8.5 miles of a 1-megaton burst, some of thes e shards will have enough energy to penetrate through the body wall, causing serious injuries involving the a bdom- inal organs. An upright, absolutely unprotected human being out in the open may be picked up by the blast wave and hurled through the air, abruptly striking the groun d or some stationary object. This refers only to people out in the open who don't have the sense to lie down on th e ground before the blast wave arrives. At the ranges from a 1-megaton burst where this type of injury would b e a primary problem (four to seven miles), a person wou ld have fifteen to thirty seconds warning between the flash and the arrival of the blast wave. That is a lot of time in which to lie down flat or dive into a ditch. Actual ly, the delay between the explosion and the blast wave at t hese distances could be very dangerous. You might think the show was over before the wave front had time to arr ive. If your guard were down, it could be a fatal surpri se. The dynamic pressure within six miles of a 1- megaton burst mimics the effects of a 90 to 120 mil e per 23 EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"TABLE 3 Arrival Time and Radius of Shock Wave Effects RADIUS AND ARRIVAL TIME SHOCK WAVE EFFECT Parked private airplanes damaged but livable; windo ws have light damage [0.5 psi] Windows heavily damaged, wood frame houses lightly damaged.

Keep this in mind when you plan your escape route. If a road is close to the target, it is likely to be blocked by debris; there may be no exit afforded. Within about 5.5 miles of a 1-megaton explosion, the average tract house collapses completely. If yo u live in such a house, you don't want to build a shelter in the basement because the house will form a pile of debr is on top of you—and maybe burn as well. This is also the point where the first minor blast injuries occur. A few elderly people at this range will suffer broken ear drums if not protected by blast-proof shelters. At 3.6 miles most cars and trucks are damaged so badly by the blast that they require major repairs before becoming driveable again. The shock wave picks them up and bounces them end-over-end down the street. Within this radius, you could easily survive the bl ast in a properly built shelter, but don't expect to drive a way afterward. At 2.2 miles lung injuries may occur. At this range the effect is not too serious, but it is very uncom fortable. A little closer to ground zero, there is a definite possibility of having highway bridges damaged too severely to use. This is actually good news in a wa y. It means that if you steer clear of target areas while driving to your retreat (a good policy in general), you sho uldn't have any trouble with collapsed bridges. Steel or c on- crete bridges will be blown out only within the zon e of massive destruction near ground zero. At a range of 1.6 miles from a 1-megaton blast, most reinforced concrete houses can no longer stand the strain. They collapse. A little closer, and the peo ple who have avoided the dynamic wind by hiding in basement s begin to receive really serious lung injuries from over- pressure. At one mile from the center of the explos ion, direct injuries caused by high overpressures produc e universal fatalities, except within exceptionally s trong blast-proof shelters. At 0.5 miles from the center of the explosion (actually inside the fireball), even thes e special shelters collapse. Notice that the same effects occur in generally the same sequence, but at greater ranges, in the case o f the 10-megaton bomb. The exact range of each effect var ies complexly when smaller weapons are compared to larger ones, but the 10-megaton radii are usually a bout twice the size of the 1-megaton radii. (For 20-mega ton damage radii, multiply the 10-megaton figures by 1. 3.) Before closing this discussion of shock waves, I should caution you about a little-known phenomenon which could catch you napping. Nuclear blast shock waves can be refracted by the upper layers of the a tmo- sphere to become refocused at the earth's surface m any miles from the explosion. During the first atomic t est at Alamagordo, New Mexico, the window-breaking power of the shock wave ought to have been limited to a four-mile radius around the explosion. (It was a sm all- kiloton range device.) Instead, the wave front pass ed into the upper atmosphere, where it was refracted a nd refocused.

Gallup is about 250 miles from the test area. Similar phenomena wer e noticed in various Nevada tests, too. The lesson is that the distribution of shock wave effects in the midst of a full-scale multi-megaton attack is a wide open question. No one has examined this e ffect in terms of megaton weapons, and, as for the possib le interactive effects of setting off 400 1-megaton wa rheads all at once within the confines of a Minuteman miss ile field... You could be hit by a structure-damaging shock wave even in the most remote parts of the country. Best to be ready for it. Thermal Effects I think it may be important to begin by telling you What the thermal flash is not. If you have read Rob ert Merle's nuclear war survival novel Malevil, you wil l recall a dramatic episode in which a single bomb de to- nated over Paris incinerated all of France in a gus t of superheated air. 4 This is the \"wall of fire\" myth, and although it is very common in anti-bomb propaganda, it is patently ridiculous. When you hear someone talki ng about the expanding \"wall of fire\" from a nuclear e xplo- sion, you can be sure that he or she has not done a ny homework. To envision the thermal flash of a nuclear explo- sion, think of very bright sunlight. When sunlight is concentrated by a magnifying glass, it is hot enoug h to start fires. The light from a nuclear bomb is so in tense that it does not require the magnifying glass in or der to be this hot. That is all there is to the thermal fl ash. A point which is not well understood by the public is that the thermal flash from small (kiloton-class ) weap- ons is actually more dangerous than that from megat on weapons. The 20-kiloton bomb dropped on Hiroshima caused horrible flash burns on the victims. This bo mb released its thermal pulse in less than a third of a second; the victims were burned literally before they reali zed what was happening. A megaton weapon, on the other hand, releases its thermal pulse over a period of f ive to twenty seconds. This makes it less dangerous to peo ple out in the open for two reasons. First, the skin ca n absorb a lot more heat without damage when there ar e even a few seconds for circulating blood to carry t he heat away to other parts of the body. Second, the long d ura- tion of the pulse gives people a few moments in whi ch to react by diving to the ground, running indoors, or taking other kinds of protective action. The second subject of interest is the range of the flash damage. The ranges listed in table 4 are maxi mum ranges for clear weather conditions. The range of t her- mal effects in real life, however, can be very hard to predict. Since the thermal pulse is composed of light, its intensity naturally decreases with distance from th e cen- ter of the explosion. This is because the light ray s spread out at increasing distances. There is also a shadin g effect caused by dust and dirt in the air (which ought to be considerable over some cities). But even this effec t is complicated by the fact that the smoke particles ca n reflect the thermal radiation as well as absorb it, which means that they don't block out quite as much of th e flash as they should. Instead, they scatter it, so even if you are protected from direct exposure to the fireb all, you can still receive reflected heat from the surro unding sky. Weather conditions can either decrease the thermal flash or accentuate it, depending on circumstances. If the target area is covered by a low overcast or fog , a bomb detonated above the cloud layer will have the same blast effects as always, but the thermal effec ts will be greatly diminished. This is because the cloud la yer reflects and scatters most of the light from the fl ash, shading the earth below. On the other hand, if the bomb should detonate below a cloud layer, the thermal ef fects will be greatly increased; heat is reflected back d own- ward by the clouds. In table 4 I have listed retinal burns as an injury which may occur at distances of hundreds of miles f rom the explosion. This is true, but the occurrence als o requires some special circumstances. The fireball i s so bright that looking at it is like looking directly at the sun. Even at very great distances, anyone who has the fi reball within field of vision at the exact instant of deto natior may suffer a retinal spot burn. The lens of the eye concentrates the light from the fireball into a sma ll spot, and within that area the retina of the eye can be p erman- ently scarred. Please note that the damage is confi ned to one very small spot, and the impairment of visual a cuity is usually slight. Only people who have the incredi ble bad luck to be staring directly at the bomb when it explodes would suffer serious impairment of vision. Even these people would not be completely blinded, but would simply be unable to focus on an object by loo king directly at it. The experts regard this kind of inj ury as extremely unlikely. There is a second influence on the eye which is of more interest to us. The incredible brilliance of t he flash is a little like having several people set off flas hbulbs around you all at once. This scattered light can be so bright that it causes temporary bleaching of the re tina, leaving you with \"dazzled\" vision. The effect clear s up in a few minutes to a few days and has no permanent ef fect on the eye. (It could, however, bring your evacuati on vehicle to an abrupt halt.)

Night- adapted eyes are much more vulnerable because the pupil is dilated. The rest of table 4 refers to the distances at whic h various common materials would be charred on the surface or would actually catch fire following the ther- mal pulse. The distances listed for human skin burn s presume that the victim is just going to stand ther e and take it. Considering that the thermal pulse of a me gaton bomb lasts several seconds, this assumption of pass ive immobility is pretty strained. You should interpret the figures as the extreme ranges at which you could po ssi- bly be burned. The skin-burn figures in table 4 do not allow for variation in skin color. White-skinned people are l ikely to have much greater resistance to flash burns than darker races. This point was brought home to me whi le viewing films of a megaton test in the Pacific in w hich a flock of black terns and white terns was exposed to a thermal pulse. When the bomb exploded, the birds we re startled and flew around in great confusion. A few seconds later, when the thermal pulse was peaking, the black birds suddenly began to trail streamers of sm oke and literally \"went down in flames.\" In seconds the flock was reduced to white birds only. Notice the emphasis in table 4 on the word \"dry\" in several categories. The scraps of newspaper lying i n the street, pine needles, or dead leaves are only going to ignite if they are bone dry. In most places that li mits the incendiary effect of the thermal pulse to the dries t summer months. If the leaves are wet and muddy or buried under a foot of snow, the thermal pulse won' t set them on fire. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 26 In spite of these factors, a nuclear explosion does produce fires. Flash ignitions account for some of the fires, but most are caused by blast damage which br eaks electrical lines, ruptures gas pipes, and generally makes kindling out of wooden buildings. We tend to think of the pictures of Hiroshima in this connection; these show a city utterly leveled and burned to the ground. It is important to remember that Hiroshima was a city of buildings composed largely of wood, paper screens, and bamboo, in which cooking facilities and heating wer e provided by charcoal braziers. A modern American ci ty isn't nearly as vulnerable to fire as was Hiroshima . According to the experts, the kind of \"fire storm\" which destroyed Hiroshima is probably not possible in our cities. Only in wholesale distribution and slum areas is there enough loose combustible material to suppo rt the beginning of a fire storm. If one did get going , it would tend to be self-limiting, since the winds gen erated by a fire storm blow inward toward the center of th e burning area and do not spread the flames. If no fire storm forms, there is still the possibil ity that normal fires might spread downwind from the ar ea of the explosion. Such fires could spread for many miles in some areas, but they would soon burn out of the devastated area and into neighborhoods with intact fire- fighting capability. In the case of an air burst wi th no significant local fallout, there is no reason why t hese fires could not be fought and contained in the norm al manner. (Of course the fact that it could be done d oesn't mean that it would be done.) Notice that even in th is case the three-quarters of the city not lying downwind o f the hypocenter would be relatively safe from fire. A significant problem for survivalists is that of wildfires started by nuclear explosions. If the war begins"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"during the driest summer months, it will be possibl e for unimaginably large areas of forest, chaparral, and grass- land to burn. (Within this century there have been fires in the northern Rocky Mountains which have burned for weeks and covered many thousands of square mile s.) These could be controlled in some areas, but in oth er locations they would burn until they ran out of for est. A wildfire can cover ground quickly, too, traveling a s fast as ten miles an hour in some cases. Even if you sel ect a retreat site that will escape all nuclear weapons e ffects, you will still have to give some thought to the del ayed arrival of forest fires. (Natural forest fires occu r all the time and will also threaten your remote retreat if the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Serv ice is too busy to put them out.) Electromagnetic Pulse In addition to the intense light of the thermal pul se, a nuclear explosion also produces a burst of electr omag- netic energy in the radio and radar portion of the spec- trum. This is called the electromagnetic pulse, or EMP. Normal air and surface bursts do not produce a sign ifi- cant degree of EMP, but extremely high-altitude exp lo- sions (on the edge of space) produce an EMP that staggers the imagination. A strong EMP can induce a current of electricity to flow in any large metal object, such as an automobi le body, a power line, or a radio antenna. The longer the object, the more powerful is the surge of induced c ur- rent. This current is capable of causing actual dam age to radios, televisions, telephone networks, power net- works, and computers. The amazing thing about the EMP effect is the range of damage. High-altitude megaton tests in the Pacific knocked out emergency communications and city power in the Hawaiian Islands, over 750 miles away. Calculations show that it will be possible for the Soviets to explode one large bomb high over Omaha, Nebraska , and disrupt electrical equipment literally from coa st to coast. If your retreat group intends to rely on CB radios, amateur radio equipment, microcomputers, telephones , or even electric blasting caps, you will need to co nsider the EMP question very carefully. 5 Nuclear Radiation Units When scientists start talking about radiation expo- sure, they use special terms to describe exactly wh at they mean. Three very common terms are the roentgen, the rad, and the rem. A roentgen is a measurement of ho w much gamma radiation is present. The rad is a measu re- ment of how much radiation is absorbed by the body (or by a radiation meter). A rem is a measurement o f how much damage the absorbed radiation does to the body. These terms are complex, and substantial \"fud ge factors\" are involved in converting one unit to ano ther, depending on the energy of the radiation, the type of living tissue exposed, and the species of animal in volved. Fortunately, for humans exposed to gamma rays from fallout, the three units are approximately the same . In the civil defense context they are treated as essen tially interchangeable. 6 I have simplified the matter by using the initial \"R\" in all instances where a more preci se meaning is not necessary. Initial Nuclear Radiation The initial nuclear radiation is that produced within the first minute of the explosion. Virtually all of the radiation produced by the bomb appears within t his time. (Fallout contains only 1 percent of the radia tion produced by the explosion.) The important thing for retreaters to know about the initial nuclear radiat ion is that it is extremely limited in range. In order to receive a lethal dose of initial radiation, a person would ha ve to be standing in a totally unprotected location less tha n two miles from the center of the fireball. If you think about that for a minute, you'll discover that anyone doom ed by this kind of radiation exposure has only seconds to live anyway. The intense blast at that range will b e lethal even if the thermal flash isn't. There is really no need to worry about initial nuclear radiation. Fallout Fallout is a simple word which represents a very complex phenomenon. Once again, though, the real danger it represents is much less than the legendar y danger. When a nuclear explosion occurs in contact with the ground, the fireball and blast pick up many ton s of dirt and carry them up into the radioactive cloud. These dirt particles become covered with molten droplets of radioactive material. When the turmoil of the explo sion quiets down, these radioactive grains begin to fall back to the ground. This is the \"fallout.\" The amount of fallout formed and its distribution over the landscape depend on many interacting facto rs, such as the design of the weapon, the size of the p articles, the height of the explosion above the ground, and t he weather conditions at the time. In the case of an a ir burst, for example, the explosion occurs high enoug h in the air that no dirt is drawn up into the cloud. In this case the radioactive gases have no particles to condense upon, and instead they form very tiny droplets whic h are too small to settle out of the air. Therefore, in a ir bursts such as those at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, casualties due to fallout are completely absent. This is a very important point to keep in mind for retreat planning, because the most efficient way to dam- age a city is by using an air burst.

These maps are typi cal of those you see in many civil defense books, and t hey are almost entirely wrong. The targets selected are inap- propriate, the weapons used are too big, and the fa llout patterns presume universal ground level bursts. I h ave included figure 2 as a counter-example. In it the d ar- kened areas represent local fallout after a realist ic attack. Under realistic circumstances the fallout p icture is much less alarming than the typical examples wou ld indicate. After a surface burst, the fallout gradually settle s to the ground over a period of about twenty-four hours . This is the local fallout and consists of granules which are large enough to see with the naked eye, althoug h the larger ones reach the ground fairly quickly, an d by the end of the twenty-four hour period the dust is very fine. After the first day, the particles remaining in the air are so fine that they take weeks or months to final ly reach the ground, usually carried by drops of rain or flakes of snow. This is the delayed fallout. The design of the weapon determines both the amount of fission products available for fallout fo rma- tion and the size and height of the mushroom cloud, which influences the fallout's distribution. In gen eral, it is only the fission portion of the bomb that produc es fallout. A 1-megaton 100 percent fission bomb will pro- duce the same amount of fallout as a 2-megaton weap on using 50 percent fission and 50 percent fusion. Alt hough the total amount of fallout is the same, the 2-mega ton bomb may produce less severe exposures on the groun d because the greater size of the cloud will spread t he fallout more thinly over a larger area. This is a c ase where \"bigger\" isn't necessarily \"badder.\" The path of a fallout particle from the top of the mushroom cloud back down to the earth's surface can be very complicated. As a particle descends, it fal ls through many layers of the atmosphere, where winds may be blowing in different directions. Therefore, as the particle falls into each new layer, it may be tempo rarily carried off in a new direction relative to the grou nd. This makes it difficult to predict exactly where the fal lout will land. Fortunately, within the United States the occ ur- rence of radical differences in wind direction betw een atmospheric levels is not that common, and we can visualize the fallout as generally being carried of f in one direction. This is a particularly good approximatio n for those areas within 50 to 100 miles of the target, w here the FIGURE 2: A Realistic Post-attack Fallout Map. This scenario assumes a counterforce strike against our ICBM fiel ds which might or might not be accompanied by air bursts over bomber bases and cities. Air bursts produce no fallout.

The speed of the wind which carries the dissipating mushroom cloud away from the target is very importa nt to the distribution of the fallout. Since almost al l of the grains reach the ground within twenty-four hours, t he total distribution of fallout on the landscape will depend on how far the wind can carry the cloud during the first day following the explosion. Less obvious is the fa ct that the particles sift out of the cloud at a constant r ate, and if a high wind carries the cloud across a large territ ory during the first day, the density of particles fall ing in any one area will be greatly reduced. High winds greatl y increase the total size of the contaminated area, b ut greatly reduce the amount of fallout on the ground at any one spot. Incidentally, the winds which move the cloud occur at an altitude of roughly 40,000 to 50,000 feet. Th e local wind direction you experience on the ground has nothing to do with winds at this height. In the Uni ted States the general rule is that these high-altitude winds travel from west to east. In the northern half of t he country, the probability that fallout will be recei ved from a target to the east is less than 1 percent. ( That means you will get fallout from the east in roughly one nuclear war out of a hundred.) In the southern stat es the appearance of tropical summer storms makes the pre- diction of fallout patterns less certain. Even then , though, west to east winds predominate. The speed o f the winds is commonly between 50 and 100 miles-per- hour and can sometimes reach 300 miles-per-hour. These speeds are high enough to help out the retrea ter by spreading the fallout very thinly in most of the co ntami- nated areas. Local weather does not normally affect the pattern of fallout deposition, but it can affect the rate o f deposi- tion. Fallout particles can be \"scavenged\" from the remains of the mushroom cloud by the strong down- drafts of thunderstorms, for instance. Also, when f allout particles drift down into a layer of moist air, the mois- ture may cause the particles to fall faster. Either mecha- nism can produce local \"hot spots\" where radioactiv ity on the ground is as much as ten to thirty times tha t of the surrounding area. Figures 3 and 4 show idealized fallout distribution s at various times after the ground-level detonation of a 1-megaton fission bomb. These examples assume that the downwind travel of the radioactive cloud procee ds at a rate of 15 miles per hour, and that winds at a ll altitudes are blowing in exactly the same direction . To see how radioactivity builds up and decays at various distances from the explosion, first conside r an area located twenty miles downwind of the target. A t one hour after the explosion, the fallout has just started to arrive. The rate of radiation exposure is only 1 0 R per hour, and the total dosage for an unprotected perso n is 10 R. Fallout continues to arrive until it reaches a peak at about two hours, when the rate of exposure is ov er 1,000 R per hour. By six hours after the explosion, fallout has stopped arriving and decay has set in, bring- ing the rate of exposure rapidly back to 300 R per hour. The total dosage accumulated continues to increase and at six hours has just reached 3,000 R. By eighteen hours the rate has fallen to 80 R per hour, and the total dose has increased to 4,800 R. After one week, the figur es will be 5 R per hour and 6,700 R total. At the end of th e first month, the rate of exposure is down to 1 R per hour and the total accumulated dosage is 7,300 R. What could people do to protect themselves at this location? A standard home fallout shelter will cut down radiation exposure to under 200 R for the whole month—a dose many people can tolerate without ill effects (see table 5). Unfortunately, the area woul d be radioactive enough to make it dangerous to re-occup y for two or three months. Unless retreaters are prep ared to stay underground for ninety days or so, they sho uld plan to evacuate. TABLE 5 Radiation Dose/Time Relationships ACUTE EFFECTS 1 WEEK 1 MONTH 4 MONTHS Medical care not needed 150 R 200 R 300 R Some need medical care 250 R 350 R 500 R [very few deaths] Most need medical care 450 R 600 R * [50% die] For a fallout situation this category will be insig nificant. If an evacuation takes only thirty minutes, a retreater could leave as early as five hours after the explosion without acquiring a lethal dose of radiat ion. After twenty-four hours, a three-hour evacuation co uld be permitted. Two days after the explosion, an eigh teen- hour evacuation could be managed. A full twenty-fou r hour exposure to the fallout could be tolerated by the fifth day. (Note that only one exposure is safe. Go ing out of the shelter for half an hour on the first day an d three hours on the second day would be very dangerous.) Now consider the situation 100 miles from the target. One hour after the blast, the fallout hasn' t even reached this area—no one has been exposed to radia- tion. The fallout starts to arrive around the sixth hour, but at first the dosage is only I R per hour and th e total exposure is negligible. After nine hours, the fallo ut has all arrived and the exposure rate is up to a peak o f 12 R per hour. (This is obviously a far cry from the pre vious example.) By eighteen hours, the rate has decayed t o 5 R per hour, and the total dose has risen to 80 R. At the end LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 30"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 31 EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of the first week, the rate is 0.3 R per hour, and the accumulated dose is 240 R. At the end of the month, the rate has fallen off to 0.07 R per hour, and the tot al dose is 300 R. In this area you could live dangerously and ignore the fallout. A total dose of 300 R in one month is risky, but most people would not die from it or even becom e very sick. (Individual responses to radiation will differ, however.) If the people at this location were to st ay inside normal wood frame houses for the whole month , their exposure would be cut in half, down to 150 R. To play it safe, however, it would be best to use home fallout shelters for at least the first twenty-four hours. This precaution alone would reduce the one-month to tal exposure to 100 R. These examples aren't precisely representative of what will happen to us in the United States, howeve r, because they presume four things that are not neces sar- ily true. The first is that the wind is blowing at 15 miles per hour. This is too slow. Usually the winds we are interested in travel with a speed greater than 50 miles per hour. Since higher wind speeds spread the fallout particles more thinly over larger areas, th is redu- ces the exposure to persons on the ground. The second assumption is that the winds at various altitudes are all traveling in the same direction. This is not a totally inaccurate assumption, but it is not per- fectly true, either. Slight differences in wind dir ection from one layer of the atmosphere to another also se rve to spread out the fallout, again reducing the expos ure of persons on the ground. The third factor concerns the use of a 100 percent fission bomb. It is more usual to assume that a meg aton- class weapon is 50 percent fission and 50 percent f usion. (The real value is actually closer to 30 percent fi ssion.) Under this assumption all the radiation exposure ra tes and total dosages are cut in half. Finally, it will be a rare location that receives f all- out from the destruction of only one missile silo. The silos are distributed in groups which are just smal l enough to assure that their fallout patterns will o verlap. As a rule of thumb, we might assume that anyone rec eiv- ing fallout from one silo will also receive fallout from nine or ten others, too. Exposure rates and total d osages should be scaled up by a factor often to take this effect into account. Notice that multiple explosions will increase the concentration of fallout on the ground but will not greatly extend the total fallout areas in the downwind direction. Since the fallout reaches the ground within twenty-four hours, the distance it tr avels depends on the wind speed only, not on the number o f bombs. What does all this boil down to? It means that the example shown in figures 3 and 4 is roughly correct for areas near missile fields but greatly exaggerated f or all other targets. Most fallout studies use \"worst case \" assumptions which make the problem look much more serious than it really is. Ecological Effects of Local Fallout What about the biological effect the fallout will have on animals and plants in the contaminated area ? Effects on unprotected people are described in deta il in Appendix D, but I assume that there will be very fe w people in the fallout areas who will be suicidal en ough to expose themselves to the radiation by standing nake d in the center of a flat field throughout the danger pe riod. Wild animals and native plants will be subjected to just such exposure, however, and it is important to appr e- ciate what the fallout will do to them. For the most part, large-bodied mammals react to ionizing radiation exactly as humans do. A dose of 1,000 R will kill every deer, elk, mountain goat, and moo se exposed to it. Smaller mammals which spend half or more of each day in burrows beneath the ground will receive some shielding from their burrows, but this effect will be canceled by their extremely close ex posure to the fallout grains on the surface of the ground during their active periods. The effect on birds should be roughly similar to the effect on mammals. Ground- dwelling birds will be much harder hit than tree-dw ellers or waterfowl. From the levels of acute radiation dosages which will occur within fifty miles of the silos, there w ill be significant damage to terrestrial plants of almost every variety. Conifers are severely injured by radiation doses of 2,000 R or more, and grassland species become severely injured at doses exceeding 20,000 R. From these figures we can expect that pine forests will be defoliated and possibly destroyed for thirty miles or so downwind of the silos. Areas of grassland devastati on will be much more restricted but will still extend for several miles downwind of each silo. I want to underline the fact that as bad as all the se effects will be, they are restricted to areas adjac ent to the missile fields. The amount of actually unlivable ar ea will be very limited. The myth that a nuclear war means a poisoned world for thousands if years is not true. Don't be taken in by it. Internal Radiation Exposure One of the most persuasive arguments of the \"we're all going to die\" crowd is that even if you manage to survive the immediate problems of direct weapons effects, local fallout, civil disruption, lack of m edication, etc., you might as well give up because strontium-9 0 will get into your bones and kill you anyway. There is nowhere you can go, say the proponents of this noti on, to escape the radioactive chemicals which will even tu- ally find their way into your body. Well, there is some LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 32"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"truth to this objection, but there is also a lot of nonsense implicit in it. How does radioactive material get into the body? For the most part, such materials are inhaled, inge sted, or enter the body through wounds. Inhalation and ingestion of fallout particles and chemicals are si gnifi- cant problems, and retreaters need to take steps to avoid these routes of contamination. Internal radiation sources are dangerous out of proportion to their activity because even alpha par ticles (which cannot penetrate the skin) are capable of in ter- acting with living cells when emitted inside the bo dy. In the tissues immediately surrounding an internal rad ia- tion source, the exposure can be extremely high eve n if the particle does not contribute significantly to t he total body dose. The potential for inducing cancer or kil ling nearby cells is relatively great. Inhalation of fallout particles is not very likely under normal circumstances because during the perio d when the local fallout is arriving (and is suspende d in the air) the particles are mostly too large to be taken in. The nose can filter out virtually all of the particles, and about 90 percent of what little does get in is soon cough ed up. Inhalation of radioactive gases is another matter. These gases, such as iodine-131, cannot be filtered out by normal means and are absorbed into the blood through the lungs. Radioactive iodine is also intro duced into the body by drinking water or food contaminate d with fallout particles. Since the iodine will disso lve in water, even strained or boiled drinking water is un safe if it has been contaminated at one time. Once inside t he body, the iodine naturally concentrates in the thyr oid gland, where it can produce permanent damage. This effect is particularly noticeable in children, whos e subse- quent growth can be stunted by the lack of thyroid hormones. Fortunately, the half-life of radioiodine is about eight days, and a few weeks after the attack, most of it will have decayed. By simply avoiding contami - nated food and water for a month or so after the at tack, you can eliminate most of the risk. Other radioactive elements which can be absorbed through the digestive system include the \"bone seek ers,\" strontium-90 and barium-140. These elements are sim - ilar to calcium in chemical behavior and tend to be come incorporated into bones, where they remain perman- ently. Strontium-90 has been the focus of some pret ty lurid tales from time to time, including prediction s of \"poisoned\" agricultural products and universal leuk e- mia. Fortunately, the natural systems through which strontium reaches the human body tend to operate ve ry much in our favor. Strontium-90 from fallout is deposited on top of the soil, and unless the ground is plowed, the stro ntium tends to remain near the surface. Plants with deep roots pick up very little of it. Even shallow-rooted plan ts absorb more calcium from the soil than strontium. When an animal eats the plants, the strontium is absorbed into its body and deposited mainly in the bones. The proportion of strontium deposited in the edible meat and milk is surprisingly low and acts a s a barrier between humans and the radioactive chemical . Even within the human body the strontium from plant or animal food is mostly eliminated, although a sma ll proportion does find its way to the bones. Once inside the bone, the strontium-90 decays slowly, releasing low-energy beta radiation, which does little damage. Unfortunately, the decay product is yttrium-90, which decays again almost immediately, producing high-energy beta radiation. In areas subj ect to local fallout, enough strontium-90 may be deposi ted in the fields to produce a noticeable (but not nece ssarily large) increase in the incidence of bone cancer, an emia, and leukemia. Areas outside of local fallout patter ns will not have sufficient strontium to produce any of the se effects. The distribution of strontium-90 from fallout cor- responds closely to the contours of local fallout a s des- cribed in Appendix B. The total extent of strontium -90 contamination exceeding current Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) standards for agriculture from a single ground burst is roughly e qual to twice the 150 R exposure contour distance. This means that even in areas where the local fallout is not too severe, the strontium-90 contamination would st ill make the land unusable under current industrial sta nd- ards. After a nuclear war, the standards may well b e revised upward substantially. Current standards are intended to prevent any possibility of an increase in the cancer rate, however small, but in the post-attack period this will no longer be an important factor.-The fal lout gamma exposure will already have boosted the cancer rate, and exceeding the ERDA strontium-90 limit wil l seem unimportant when the only alternative is starv a- tion. There will be locations too heavily contamina ted to use for agriculture, but they will be limited in ex tent. To put this in perspective, we have been talking about \"acceptable\" gamma ray exposures as high as 150 R i n the civil defense context, but a dose of even I R w ould alarm an ERDA health physicist. Strontium-90 won't be that big a problem. Cesium-137 is another internal emitter but it diffe rs from strontium-90 in four significant ways. First o f all, it tends to stay in the soil and not be taken up by pl ants. The primary way for it to enter an animal's body is through ingestion of surface-contaminated plant mat e- rials. The second important difference is that cesi um imitates potassium (rather than calcium) and tends to concentrate in meat instead of bone. Therefore, the ingestion of meat from animals which have been feed ing on contaminated plants can be hazardous. The third 33 EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"difference is that cesium-137 is a gamma ray emitte r and contributes to the whole body radiation dose rather than concentrating in one organ. Lastly, cesium has a re la- tively short biological half-life and is 90 percent elimi- nated from the body within a year of being ingested . There are other internal radiation sources, but iodine, strontium, and cesium are the three which a re the most dangerous. The others either imitate the behav ior of these three elements, or they are not retained b y the body and are rapidly eliminated. For retreaters the les- son is that it would be better to avoid fallout are as when you select a location for your post-attack homestea d. If you do have to raise your own food in a fallout con tami- nated area, remember that internal emitters won't k ill you outright but will increase the possibility of d ying from radiation-induced diseases. Much of what we know about internal radiation comes from studies of radium wristwatch-dial painters who used to lick th eir brushes to keep them pointed and unknowingly swal- lowed enormous doses of radium (a bone seeker). Man y of these people were still around decades later whe n the Argonne National Laboratory scientists went looking for them. The workers had serious bone damage, but they had not been killed en masse. You won't be eit her. Long-term Effects In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences pub- lished \"Long-term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear Weapons Detonations,\" a massive evaluation of the effects a full scale nuclear war will have o n those parts of the world not within the influence of the direct weapons effects and local fallout. 7 The scientists attempt- ed to evaluate and predict the results of a United States/ Soviet war involving roughly 1,000 explosions in th e 10-megaton class and 5,000 explosions of about 1 me g- aton. (You have to admit that they were picturing a pretty respectable war.) Their report is the most u p-to- date evaluation of this subject; I have used it hea vily in preparing the material for this section. The long-term effects of a nuclear explosion arise from three processes. The first is the injection of radio- active particles into the stratosphere, where they remain as a suspended aerosol for months before coming dow n. The second factor in creating long-term effects is the injection of non-radioactive dust into the stratosp here along with the delayed fallout. Like an immense vol - canic eruption, the detonation of thousands of silo - destroying megaton weapons will put millions of ton s of dust into the air, effectively changing the clarity of the atmosphere and shading the planet's surface. The sc ien- tists predicted a resulting drop in average tempera ture of about 1 degree centigrade. The dust is expected to settle out of the air completely in two years or so. The third factor is the creation of enormous amounts of nitrogen oxides in the superheated air o f the mushroom clouds. Oxides of nitrogen in the quantiti es expected from the detonation of 10,000 megatons wil l produce a significant reduction in atmospheric ozon e. Since the ozone screens us from solar ultraviolet ( UV) light, the amount of UV light will rise dramaticall y. The NAS scientists were very cautious about saying exac tly how great an increase there will be, but their ball park estimate was in the vicinity of six times the prese nt UV level. This effect will return to near-normal level s in five or six years, although total recovery will take dec ades. What effects will these developments actually have on us and our surroundings? Let's take plants first . Natural plant communities outside of local fallout areas will show no damage from delayed fallout, but the d rop in world temperature and the UV light increase coul d have drastic effects in some areas. Not much is yet known about the UV threat except that some plants seem to be very sensitive to this type of light; a world- wide six-fold increase in U V light might mean exti nction for many natural species, possibly including a few very important natural dominants. That one is left hangi ng. We may assume that climatic cooling won't hurt native plants very much because we know from expe- rience that plant communities can survive such peri ods without any damage. The volcanic eruption at Kraka- toa, for example, did little to harm natural plant com- munities in the rest of the world. Crops will be mo re severely affected, however, because even a 1-degree drop in average temperature significantly shortens the n um- ber of frost-free days in a local growing season. T hedrop in temperature will eliminate wheat growing in Cana da for a year or two and will move agricultural belts a few hundred miles southward all over the continent. More serious is the fact that many agricultural crops show tremendous variation in UV sensitivity. Corn, soybeans, barley, wheat, and alfalfa are fair ly resistant to UV damage and can be relied on to grow under high UV illumination, but tomatoes, peas, bea ns, onions, sugar beets, and lettuce will not do well a t all. I think about that fact every time I see advertisemen ts for \"disaster\" vegetable seed canisters. Corn is usuall y the only plant offered that would stand a chance of sur viv- ing the UV exposure (see table 5). 8 Most wild animals will not suffer greatly from the long-term radioactivity produced by a nuclear war. The lifetime residual radiation dose for most wildlife will be about 2 rads (or 2 rem on the human scale). This is close enough to the natural background level to be unnoti cea- ble. There may be some damage to wildlife in arctic and alpine ecosystems, where lichens and mosses are the chief form of plant food, because these plants tend to concentrate fallout. This biological magnification will increase the internal dosage of radiation received by herbivores such as caribou. The UV light increase is likely to be a more seriou s LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 34"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"danger to wildlife species than radiation. Many ani mal species are dependent upon particular plants which may die out under high UV exposure. This possibility is too uncertain to explore with any confidence, but as a hypo- thetical example, imagine the implications for a po pula- tion of squirrels if suddenly their entire forest o f oak trees were to die. Starvation would reach all the w ay up the food chain to animals which prey on squirrels, to still others which prey on the predators. Direct effects of UV on wildlife are possible, but they shouldn't be serious for most animals. Experie nce has shown that animals which have accidentally beco me sensitive to sunlight (by eating certain toxic plan ts) simply find a shady place to spend the day and then forage at night. With the exception of birds, most of which are helpless in the dark, I suspect that most wild- life will adopt the nocturnal pattern for a few yea rs. (Actually, many mammals are naturally nocturnal and are not in direct danger from U V anyway.) Larger m am- mals that typically spend the winter searching for food in snow-covered areas will not fare so well, howeve r. The high UV concentration may mean severe snow- blindness and starvation for them. After the first winter, big game could be very scarce in much of the temper ate zone. Effects on domestic animals will be almost identica l to those for wildlife. If there are humans around t o guide animals to food and water, however, livestock will not be seriously affected. What about people? Many of the nuclear war hor- ror stories we see on television or read about in s cience fiction novels involve sweeping long-term dangers, guar- anteed to exterminate the human race if the hero of the story fails to clobber the bad guy in time. This is gar- bage. Of all the large animals on the planet, we ha ve the least to fear. This is mainly due to the fact that people are capable of understanding what is happening and can take steps to protect themselves. That is what this book is about, after all. The total residual radiation dose (both internal an d external) for a human survivor not living in an are a of local fallout will amount to less than 10 rem for a period extending up to thirty years after the war. Once ag ain, this is next to nothing. Remember that the exposure has to be over 200 rem delivered within a week to cause acute, lethal reactions in even 1 percent of the po pula- tion. We are talking about 1 / 3 rem per year or le ss. It doesn't seem very alarming, does it? If you have read Nevil Shute's On the Beach, you will remember the terrifying and inevitable wait fo r the end, when the delayed fallout from the northern hem i- sphere finally spread to Australia, killing the las t human survivors after just a few days of exposure. 9 The dis- armament people have made great use of this myth, hinting that it really could happen. Could it? A good-sized nuclear war will produce only 1/3 rem of exposure per year for residents of the north ern hemisphere, and the evidence to date indicates that land areas in the southern hemisphere will get only one- third as much radiation as in the north. Let's make it ea sy and call it 1/10 rem per year for Australia. How many w eap- ons would we have to detonate to increase the long- term fallout exposure level for Australia up to an average of 1,000 rem per week? The answer, rounded off a little, is 500,000 times the number of weapons wh ich the NAS thought would be enough for a full scale wa r. Even with the insane competitiveness of the arms ra ce, I suspect that it will be a while before we can match every available weapon with half a million others just li ke it. What effect will a 10-rem exposure over thirty year s have on the northern hemisphere survivors? For one thing, there will be an increase of about 2 percent in the spontaneous cancer death rate. (I suspect that ther e will be simultaneous increases in deaths from starvation , disease, and local riots which will make the cancer rate next to invisible in any case.) There will also be an increase in the numbers of radiation-induced deform i- ties in unborn infants at the time of the war, but the increases will not be distinguishable from non-radi ation defects. The effect of inhaled plutonium particles in produc - ing cancer of the lungs was not clearly defined by the Academy report; there is some controversy over that subject at this time. One interesting comment, reco rded in the report, though, was that the average New Yor ker in 1963 had about 1,000 plutonium particles in his lungs derived from weapons testing fallout. At last repor t, New York was nearly bankrupt but not experiencing any lack of population. The increased U V dose to humans may produce a 3 to 30 percent increase in the levels of skin cancer when averaged for the forty years following the war. Thi s means that while every 100 people who develop skin cancer now, between 103 and 130 may get the disease during the years after the war. This prediction ass umes that everybody will spend a lot of time basking in the sun during the first three years, when the UV levels wi ll be high. The cancer would be a delayed effect of this expo- sure. There is a serious objection to this assumpti on, however. If the U V levels get that high, a Caucasi an will develop a blistered sunburn within ten minutes of e xpo- sure to the sun. Incapacitating snowblindness will occur equally quickly in snowy areas. Most people will pr oba- bly try to avoid the sun for a while, which should cut down on the projected skin cancer rate. Remember th at the UV problem only lasts a few years, not forever. The final long-term effect on humans is the poten- tial genetic damage which could be caused by radiat ion or UV light. Once again, many movies have been made which capitalize on rampaging mutants, deforme d 35 EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"monsters, and other supposedly \"genetic\" changes in the human race. What are the facts? The Academy scientists carefully took everything into consideration and decided that there will be a n increase in birth defects of about 0.1 percent. Thi s means that the spontaneous rate of defective children, wh ich is 6 percent in our country, will increase to a high o f perhaps 6.1 percent in the years after the war. Onc e again, the difference will be too small to notice, and the effect will be temporary. For retreaters, the long-term effects of a nuclear war pose four direct difficulties. The first is the problem of being able to function in a high-UV environment. That ten-minute sunburn will be a serious nuisance. The second problem is the scalding of crops by UV light , which will mean that many of our most productive fo od plants will have to be shelved for several years un til the UV levels return to normal. The two to three years of abnormally cool weather will mean that a crop which does well at your retreat site under normal conditi ons will be unable to succeed there when the agricultur al belts shift to the south. Lastly, U V-induced blind ness in big game animals (other than hibernating bears, per - haps), will make hunting a very unproductive activi ty in any areas subjected to winter snows. Retreaters wil l have to take all these phenomena into account in th eir survival plans. Effect on Civilization The long-term effect which a full scale nuclear war will have on Western civilization is fairly easy to define. Western civilization as we know it will cease to ex ist. 10 There can be little doubt that a catastrophe which severely damages all the major cities of a civiliza tion, which reduces the human population of those cities to a quarter of their original number, which destroys th e factories, tools, and power sources upon which the econ- omy is based, and which then causes ecological dist ur- bances sufficiently great to make agriculture diffi cult for five or six years will deal a very severe blow to t he stability of the civilization. When you consider th at our civilization has been showing signs of running out of raw materials, that the easy seams of coal and veins of iron ore have all been used up long ago, that we have ha d to travel to the shore of the Arctic Sea for oil, you begin to suspect that economic recovery will not be possible . Politically, it is difficult to imagine the United States government surviving the crisis. The halls o f government are high-priority targets both at the national and state levels. Since the military force s will bear the brunt of the attack, it is doubtful that t he nation will be able to muster a viable defense after the w ar. The great probability is that individual counties and a ssocia- tions of towns will band together into local allian ces. The old line from the Declaration of Independence about our nation being composed of \"free and inde- pendent states\" may again become true for the first time in 200 years. Within these recovering fragments of the nation, it is likely that local economies will soon be establi shed with a fair amount of specialized labor. People wil l start using their old knowledge to put things back together. The people who say that we will become sa v- ages, or that at best we will be thrown back to the level of pre-industrial America, are not right. Imagine Civi l War era Americans with a detailed knowledge of electron ics, aerodynamics, medicine, and modern agricultural science who have the wreckage of 250 major cities t o plunder for parts. It will not be a return to an ol d way of life, and it will not be a matter of living like sa vages. It will be another in a long string of difficult ages, when human beings will work hard to rebuild their world — as they have done so many times in the past. What about Civil Defense? For those of you who are wondering what the nation's civil defense program could do for you in the event of a nuclear attack, the answer is nothing. T his is not just my opinion. In a recent interview, the dir ector of the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency, Bardyl Tiran a, candidly admitted that there is no real civil defen se program in this country anymore.\" When asked what he would tell his family if he knew an attack was c oming, Tirana replied, \"I don't know. I guess I'd tell my wife to get in the car and start driving. To where, I don't know.\" If the Tiranas had joined a retreat group they woul d know where to go in a crisis. How about you? Commentary Before closing this chapter, I think it is appropri ate to discuss a few political subjects. The point of v iew of the survivalist is unique and provokes an unusual s pec- trum of political attitudes regarding military spen ding and arms control efforts. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 36 Survivalists should vigorously oppose the follow- ing developments: 1. Strategic arms limitation treaties. The SALT tal ks were a noble idea, but in practice they have made a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"nuclear war more likely in the near future by widen ing the Soviet lead in strategic weapons. 2. Any new land-based missile program, whether using silos, underground mobile launchers, or surface mobile launchers. More than 90 percent of the fallo ut we can expect from a Soviet attack will come from t he destruction of our existing land-based missiles. Adding more gratuitous targets will just make our individual survival problems that much more difficult. 3. Deployment of strategic cruise missiles. Most of these mindless missiles will detonate over Soviet targets which have already been damaged by previous missile attacks. Multiple detonations over devastat ed areas will just add to the long-term ecological dis tur- bance without aiding the military effort. 4. \"Super-fallout\" enhanced radiation weapons. There was once a lot of interest in \"salting\" nuclear wea p- ons to produce very long-lived fallout. This would have been used to deny access to a region of specia l military or industrial value. Any future resurgence in this interest should be vigorously opposed. The lon g- term effects are severe enough as it is. Survivalisls should support these developments: 1. Any form of civil defense activity, even the dubiou s crisis relocation plans in fashion at the moment. G ov- ernment civil defense efforts generate research and surplus equipment of direct benefit to survivalists . Examples of these resources include both the surplu s radiation meters discussed in chapter 8 and the gov - ernment target list studies mentioned in Appendix A . 2. The B-l bomber, or any similar piloted delivery sys - tem. Any human-controlled vehicle is preferable to any computer-controlled vehicle from our point of view. A human pilot, unlike a cruise missile autopi lot, can elect to abort the mission if the primary targe t has already been destroyed. It's the best way to av oid the ecological consequences of \"pounding the rubble.\" 3. Improved missile guidance systems. The next genera- tion of ICBM guidance systems is expected to drop a Minuteman warhead within thirty feet of a Soviet si lo after a 2,000-mile flight. If guidance systems can really be made this accurate, megaton warheads will be unnecessary for silo destruction. Small sub-kiloton warheads, or even conventional explosives, might be substituted. This would virtually eliminate the pos si- bility of serious ecological disruption. 4. Deployment of the neutron bomb. This weapon is the first positive achievement in forty years of nuclea r weapons development. With about 2,000 1-kiloton neutron warheads, the NATO forces could easily stop a Soviet armored attack on western Europe and still have a territory worth defending afterward. The abi l- ity to achieve this military goal without destroyin g the defended territory is a tremendous step forward. Th e weapons NATO now stocks would stop the Soviet tanks easily enough, but they would also cause seve re damage to the defended nations. 5. The Trident submarine program. To the extent that Trident submarines can be used to make Minuteman silos obsolete, they are a positive development. Ev en though the Trident system multiplies the total numb er of megatons poised in readiness for a \"spasm\" war, this is tolerable if it helps eliminate the land-based s ilos. As survivalisls, we can tolerate any development which removes the 2,600 American and Soviet missile silos from the first-strike target lists. Unlike more conventional political groups, people concerned with surviving a nuclear war must occasio n- ally support increased military spending (even if i t undermines the dollar) and at other times oppose it (even if it weakens our defenses). Whether or not t he war will be fought is not the question here. The questi on is how it will be fought. The goal of survivalist poli tical activity in this area must be to alter the conduct of the war toward improved post-attack survival conditions . No one else is looking at the subject in quite this way. Notes 1. A wealth of information is available to survivalist s in the publications of various United States government agencies. When I have referred to such a document, I have included its depository call number to help you find it in a lib rary.

To flee or not to flee? Run or stay? Retreat or dig in? To continue to paraphrase Hamlet , is it better to sit still and take it or to get out of the way? Well, it depends. This chapter is intended to help guide you in selec t- ing among several difficult alternatives in your pe rsonal survival planning. In the case of a nuclear war (or some other massive disaster you may have in mind) will y ou be better off staying at home or would it be better if you evacuate to another area? If you decide to stay, wh at will you need to do in order to secure your position at home? If your decision is to evacuate, where will you go? How will you get there? Should you drive, hike, sail, o r fly? Would it be better to evacuate now, immediately, or wait until the last minute? How will you know when the last minute is at hand? These are some of the difficult questions every group of retreat planners faces at first. The answe rs depend mainly on your personal situation. Where you live, how many people are in your group, and how mu ch money you can spend will all affect the decisions. The only area which is completely up to you is how much effort and inconvenience you are willing to tolerat e in the name of security. You could move to Bora-Bora a nd be completely safe from nuclear attack, but in exch ange for that security you would have to give up frequen t trips to the movies, the grocery store, and your doctor. Where do you draw the line? That's up to you. Predicting Nuclear Danger Areas and Fallout Pattern s In Appendix A you will find a map and a list describing over 1,500 nuclear attack high-risk area s defined by the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (a nd which I have updated). These include 1,054 missile silos which are listed as aggregated \"complexes.\" Areas s ub- ject to extremely high fallout are also indicated. You should check to see if your home or potential retreat location appears on this list. You may be s ur- prised to discover that many nuclear targets are lo cated in remote corners of National Forests, etc. It woul d be better to be surprised now while looking over the l ist, rather than later . . . The target list is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary targets. Primary targets are mainly St ra- tegic Air Command missile and/or bomber bases and support facilities. These targets will be hit withi n min- utes of the outbreak of the war. Secondary targets are industrial or governmental targets and may be hit i mme- diately or may be designated for attention by Sovie t bombers several hours after the first strike. Terti ary targets are centers of civilian population. These t argets probably won't be hit in the first strike. As I mentioned in chapter 2, predicting where the fallout from a particular target will go is a shaky busi- ness at best. It is impossible to know what directi on the wind will be blowing in the 40,000- to 50,000-foot layer at the moment of detonation, and for this reason, m ost people simply give up on the whole idea. This is a mistake. Although you can't accurately predict wher e the fallout will go, you can do a pretty accurate j ob of figuring out where it won't go. Since retreaters ar e usu- ally more interested in locating safe areas than da nger areas, the mapping of fallout-free locations fits i n very well with their needs. First let's establish some fundamentals. The basic idea here is to plot on a map all the areas near yo ur home (or your proposed retreat) which probably will not receive any local fallout from targets nearby or in sur- rounding states. By \"probably will not receive any local fallout\" I mean those areas where the probability o f any particular spot receiving fallout is less than 2 pe rcent. If you build your house or retreat encampment in such an area, you could expect to receive fallout once in f ifty nuclear wars. Good enough? 39 TO FLEE OR NOT TO FLEE"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The next question is, what do we mean by \"fallout?\" For the special purposes of this discussion, I have arbi- trarily defined fallout as sufficient local fallout to pro- duce 150 rem of radiation exposure in the first two weeks following the attack. If you get less fallout than that, you will be in little danger, because even th e most modest protection will cut your exposure down to ne g- ligible levels; even without protection, the conseq uences of such radiation would not be too serious. If your area receives more than 150 rem in the first two weeks, you will have a radiation problem, and some more sophis ti- cated measures will be needed to insure your surviv al. Therefore we will be mapping areas that have less t han a 2 percent chance of receiving more than 150 rem i n the first two weeks. The next question has to do with the targets that will produce fallout. The actual selection is up to you, although Appendix A will help guide your decision. Real-life predictions should involve consideration of local fallout coming only from missile silos and ce rtain key military targets with hardened facilities. Thes e include bases located near Omaha, Nebraska; Riversi de, California; Washington, DC; Colorado Springs, Colo- rado; and possibly the submarine bases at Bremerton , Washington, and Charleston, South Carolina. It is a virtual certainty that the other primary targets (m ainly SAC bomber bases) will be hit with air bursts and w ill produce no fallout. If you are the kind of person who believes that the Soviets will try to generate as much fallout as pos sible and will hit as many military bases and cities as p ossible, you are welcome to go to the extra work of taking a ll targets into consideration, but I suggest that you not bother. Under those circumstances there aren't any totally \"safe\" areas worth mentioning. If you are m ore interested in real-world predictions, however, you can rapidly eliminate your local danger areas and conce n- trate on safer locations. Who knows where the wind blows? Several years ago the DCPA compiled \"effective wind direction\" da ta for the fallout-carrying layers of the atmosphere o ver forty representative cities throughout the United S tates. It found that fallout would almost always be blown to the east of any target. When the high-altitude wind s were moving very slowly, the wind direction was usu ally between north-northeast and south-southeast. At nor - mal speeds—around 50 or 60 miles per hour—the wind direction was usually between northeast and southea st. At higher speeds, the range of variation was even l ess, roughly between east-northeast and east-southeast. The DCPA people were kind enough to supply me with the raw data from this study in \"windrose\" for mat, which gives the exact percentage of time in which t he fallout would be blown a particular direction at a partic- ular speed from any of the forty cities. I used the se data to define the directions from each city which could be expected to receive fallout more than 2 percent of the time. Most cities had three such fallout sectors, c orre- sponding to 20, 40 and 60 mile per hour wind speeds . In addition, several cities had a fourth danger sector pro- duced by rare winds over 80 miles per hour. These sectors are listed in Appendix B. Once you know in what direction the fallout may be blown, how do you know how far it may go? This was a difficult question for me to investigate because th e sources disagree, sometimes by very wide margins. T he \"problem\" lies in the fact that the Atomic Energy C om- mission did not want to kill thousands of people wi th their tests and therefore avoided creating too much fallout in their Nevada explosions. The Pacific tes ts did generate plenty of fallout, but almost all of it fe ll into the sea before anybody could measure it accurately. Thi s leaves us with theoretical models which differ from one another almost as much as they differ from real lif e. Eventually I selected two sources of information about the downwind extent of the 150 rem exposure area at two weeks. The first, of course, was Glasst one's The Effects of Nuclear Weapons. 1 The second was the DCPA publication User's Manual, Meteorological Data for Radiological Defense. 2 As you will see in com- paring the two sources (in table 6), the DCPA figur es indicate downwind travel of fallout about one and o ne- half times as great as the Glasstone figures. Both pre- sume 50 percent fission surface bursts. Which set o f figures you decide to use is largely a matter of op inion. If you assume that Glasstone is right, then the DCPA figures represent a substantial margin of safety. I f the DCPA figures are right for 50 percent fission, then the Glasstone figures are very close to correct for 30 percent fission, which is a real-world estimate of the actu al fission content of the bombs. I prefer to use the DCPA figures for 1-megaton fallout and Glasstone's figures for the 10-megaton fall- out. On one hand, I know that I'm not overestimatin g the smaller fallout danger areas, which is the safe thing to do. On the other hand, using Glasstone's figures for the 10-megaton patterns assures me that I am not un der- estimating them by real-world standards, nor am I o ver- looking potential retreat areas by exaggerating the fallout danger radius. This is a real problem in te rms of the Minuteman silo fallout; if you use the DCPA fig - ures, the danger radii are so large that nothing ea st of the Rocky Mountains could be thought of as a safe area. That makes retreat planning difficult, to say the l east. Mapping Fallout-safe Areas The following paragraphs describe the method of mapping fallout safe areas within the United States .

(Distances indicate areas from the target at fourteen days.) the one produced by the American Automobile Associa - tion. It is important that the map be relatively la rge and that it include the whole country, exclusive of Ala ska and Hawaii. (Residents of these states can make do with a state map.) Refer to Appendix A. Mark a circle on the map that encloses the entire area within 1,000 miles of your loca- tion (or the proposed location of your retreat). Pl ot the locations of all missile fields within this circle. (The missile fields are located exactly in Appendix A; g ener- ally, these may be found in the following states: M on- tana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Ne- braska, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Arizona—see also figure 7.) Draw another circle on your map, this time enclos- ing everything within 350 miles of your home or ret reat site. Within this circle, plot the location of all primary, secondary, and tertiary targets. Use a \"l\" to desig nate primary targets, a \"2\" for secondary targets, and a \"3\" for tertiary targets. Now consult the list of forty cities in Appendix B, and check off the names of the cities on the list w hich fall within your two mapped circles. Mark their location s on your map. Next, carefully plot the fallout danger patterns fo r each of the cities which you checked in the last st ep. You will draw these patterns on a separate sheet of pap er, cut them out, and use them as tracing templates in plot ting the danger regions on your map. Figures 5A-5F show you how to construct the fall- out danger zone for Albuquerque, New Mexico, follow - ing a 1-megaton surface burst in that city. The sam e procedure can be used with any of the remaining thi rty- nine cities listed in Appendix B. Figure 5A: The easiest way to plot fallout patterns is to use \"polar coordinate\" graph paper. You can u se blank paper, a protractor, ruler, and compass if yo u like, but the graph paper helps. The very center of the c on- centric circles on the graph paper will be the loca tion of the target—Albuquerque in this case. Write in the d irec- tions of north, east and south. (In most cases you won't need to put in west, because the fallout won't go t hat way.) Now label the radial lines with their \"degree \" designations. The line running due north from the t arget is 0 degrees. The line running east is 90 degrees. Due south is 180 degrees. The number of degrees increas es as you travel clockwise around the circle. Now, how far will the fallout travel downwind? For this example I have used the DCPA estimate for a 1-megaton surface burst: according to table 6, the fall- out will travel 140 miles at 20 miles per hour wind speed, 265 miles at 40 miles per hour, or 310 miles at 60 miles per hour. Check the legend of your map to see what the scale is. It may say \"One inch equals approximately 100 miles\"; this means that the 140-mile distance will be a radius of 140/100 = 1.4 inches. A distance of 265 m iles reduced by the same method is 2.65 inches, and 310 miles becomes 3.10 inches. If the scale on your map is not 100 miles to the inch, the method still works. Divide the distance concerned by the map's scale to get th e inches of distance on the map. Then draw in three a rcs representing 140, 265, and 310 miles on your graph paper. You are now ready to start plotting the dang er areas. Figure 5B: Referring to Appendix B, you see that the 20 mile per hour danger zone for Albuquerque extends from 25 degrees to 175 degrees clockwise. D raw two vectors from the target out to the 140-mile lin e. This wedge-shaped area is where the fallout from Albu- querque will most probably be deposited when the hi gh- altitude wind speed is 20 miles per hour.

Draw in these vectors a nd extend them to the 265-mile line. This is the area where the fallout will most likely be deposited when the high- altitude winds are blowing at 40 miles per hour. Figure 5D: At 60 miles per hour, the winds deposit the fallout within an area from 55 degrees to 105 d egrees clockwise, extending to a range of 310 miles.

In s ome cases you would have to draw a fourth danger area f or the 80 mile per hour winds.) Figure 5E: In this figure all three danger areas ha ve been plotted together. The 20, 40, and 60 mile per hour danger areas are superimposed in the diagram. The n ext step is to draw a smooth outline around the ragged and angular pattern of wedges you have constructed. Thi s step will reflect the fact that the winds blow at a ll the speeds between 20, 40, and 60 miles per hour, too. This outer dashed line represents the total danger area for fallout from a 1-megaton surface burst occurring at Albuquerque. Figure 5 F: Here the outline of the total danger ar ea has been plotted along with an idealized fallout pa ttern. Notice that the area covered by the fallout pattern is much less than the total area within the danger zon e. The danger zone simply represents the extent of pla ces where the fallout could come down. As figure 6 indi - cates, the predicted danger zone for the Nevada tes t site far exceeded the actual location of fallout. Reconsider figure 5E for a minute. You may have wondered what the numbers were all about. It is not easy to predict the relative risk of living at different locations within the total danger area, but by checking to se e how the 20, 40, and 60 mile per hour danger areas overl ap, you can get at least a rough estimate of the hazard ous locations. The numbers refer to how many of the thr ee individual danger areas overlap each section of the dia- gram. The wedge-shaped area directly to the east of the target is overlain by all three patterns and has th e best chance of receiving fallout. Areas overlapped by on ly two patterns are not quite as dangerous, and those within only one pattern are safer still. Areas mark ed \"+\" are probably within only one pattern. Areas marked zero are judged safe. This method of sub-dividing t he danger zone is not statistically sound, but for cru de approximation it can be very useful. Note that this method also applies to situations where overlapping fallout from more than one target is a possibility. There are a couple of important exceptions to be aware of in plotting fallout danger areas by this m ethod. The first is that some cities in the southeastern p art of the country have a second danger area listed for wind s peeds in the 20 mile per hour category. Sometimes in the spring and summer, the wind blows slowly to the wes t in these locations. This produces fallout danger maps with a short, stubby \"tail\" sticking out to the west. Th e pat- tern shown for Charleston, South Carolina in figure 7 is one such example. Another exception has to do with 10-megaton fall- out patterns. At extreme ranges (such as those 600 to 1,000 miles downwind) the exact limits of the dange r area are very unreliable. The fallout cloud will al most certainly change direction and speed somewhat befor e traveling that far. The danger area calculated for 10- megaton fallout using this method is only useful fo r general planning. Don't make the mistake of feeling safe just because you are 1,001 miles from the target. Y ou can't cut it that fine. I have adopted the expedient of using a 10-megaton pattern as a model for the fallout that will be gen erated by the destruction of missile silos. There will act ually be much more fallout generated by these explosions tha n a 10-megaton figure would indicate, but the explosion s will be spread over such a wide area that you need only worry about 10-megaton's worth passing over you at any particular point downwind. To figure the danger areas for a missile field, just plot a 10-megaton p attern from the edge of the missile field that is closest to you. If the line misses you, you are probably safe. Now that you have drawn the danger pattern tem- plates you will need for your area, carefully cut t hem out. You can use these cut-out shapes to plot the d anger area boundaries for any target on your map. To draw the danger boundary for a particular target, select the tem- plate from the nearest city to the target, place th e \"target\" spot on the template over the target locat ion on the map, line up the east-west line on the template with the east-west line on the map, and carefully trace a line around the edge of the template. Your map now shows where the fallout from that particular target is li kely to land. Draw the fallout danger areas for all the mis sile fields on your map and also for any primary or seco n- dary targets that you suspect will be hit at ground level. (Most of them won't be.) When you are done you will have mapped the dangerous and safe areas near you, and you can proceed to your selection of a retreat site, a new neighborhood, or escape route. What does this method of mapping fallout tell us about the situation in the United States following a hypothetical attack? Figure 7 is a map of the proba ble fallout areas in the United States following a real -world attack on military and industrial targets (see also figure 2). As you can see, most of the country is in littl e danger from fallout. And as noted, even within the plotted danger areas only a small proportion of the area wi ll actually receive fallout. Even so, anyone who lives in the Central Time Zone should give serious consideration to digging a deep fallout shelter. The Dakotas, Nebras ka, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri are clearly in more dang er than the rest of the nation. Notice in figure 7 that the areas outside the fallo ut danger regions are \"safe\" only in the sense that th ey will receive no fallout. There are two or three hundred fairly important targets in the rest of the country which would not generate fallout but which would not be safe to be near.

As calculated by the method described in the text, areas enclosed by broken lines will receive most of the fallout generated in a realisti c attack by the Soviet two \"doomsday\" assumptions, namely that all primary targets will be hit at ground level, or, alternatel y, that every target in the country will be hit at ground l evel. If all the primary targets are hit with fallout- generating ground bursts, there will still be a sel ection of potential refuges where the probability of receivin g fall- out from any particular target is under 2 percent. I refer to these areas as \"Type A\" refuges. One of the larg est of these refuges is in western Canada (area 1). If you like foreign travel, you might dodge to the north. Withi n the United States, the Pacific coast from San Francisco to the Canadian border will be fairly fallout-free, in cluding a sizable chunk of east-central Oregon (area 2). Ne ar Los Angeles, the safest fallout refuges are the Cha nnel Islands (area 3), forty or more miles off the coast . People who routinely sail to the islands on weekends might decide to take an extended vacation if things start to look bad. There are Type A refuges in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona (area 4), Colorado and New Mexico (area 5), the Big Bend area of Texas (area 6), and the southe rn tip of Texas from roughly San Antonio south to the Mexi - can border (area 7). Much of Mexico itself (area 8) , of course, will be fallout-free. Union. Targets which generate fallout are missile s ilo fields and a few special military bases. (Compare to figure 2.) The refuges numbered 9, 10, and 11 are \"Type B\" refuges. These aren't really good refuges, but cons ider- ing the circumstances, they are the best the centra l part of the country has to offer. Assuming that they rec eive no missile field fallout, the probability of gettin g fallout from other primary targets is under 2 percent for t hese areas. That's the best I can do for the Midwest. On the east coast there are four refuges. The northernmost is in upstate New York (area 12) and extends across the Canadian border into Ontario. Th is is the only portion of civilized Canada east of Alb erta which is unlikely to receive fallout from United St ates targets (under the assumption that all primary targ ets will be hit at ground level, of course). Area 13 is in southern Virginia and North Carolina. This is roughly where our national leaders have the ir special fallout shelters, complete with offices, do rmito- ries, cafeterias, tennis courts, and the communicat ions equipment necessary to run a country (and a war) fr om deep underground. Area 14 extends along the Gulf Coast from New Orleans across the Florida peninsula to Jacksonvill e. The last Type A refuge (area 15) lies between Fort Myers 45 TO FLEE OR NOT TO FLEE "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"and Fort Lauderdale, just north of the Florida Everglades. The Type A and Type B areas assume that all primary targets will be hit at ground level. What i f all domestic targets are hit at ground level? In that case, the probability of getting fallout in the Type A and B areas rises to the point that they can not be considered refuges any longer. In the case of an al l-out, genocidal attack on our country (which is extremely hard for me to envision) only the \"Type C\" areas wi ll still have less than a 2 percent chance of getting danger ous levels of fallout. There are only three such refuge s. The first is in western Canada (area 1), the second is around the Oregon-California border (area 2), and the thir d is Mexico south of Monterrey (area 8). All of these ar eas, of course, are also Type A refuges. As this book was going to press, Congress allocated funds for the development of the controversial MX missile. This is to be a system of 200 land-based m issiles mounted on mobile platforms. The idea is that each missile can be moved constantly from one random pos i- tion to another within a ten-mile long trench, maki ng Soviet targeting problems hopelessly complex. In my opinion, this project is sheer folly. I strongly su spect that the Soviets will respond by developing the capabili ty to pulverize the entire length of each trench. Only th eir technological limitations and the SALT treaties wou ld hamper them in this goal. Since the MX system is th e \"answer\" to the Soviets' rapidly developing ability to hit every Minuteman missile silo, it doesn't seem likel y that missile technology will hinder them much in coping with the MX system. I may be old-fashioned, but I don't think the treaties will hinder them much either. At present, the MX trenches are to be built on government lands in the states of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. If these trenches are ever at - tacked, they will generate twice the overall amount of fallout we would expect to see from existing silos (because it will require several warheads to destro y each trench).

Still, 1 want to be sure that you have not lost you r perspective while looking at these maps. These refu ges are not the only safe places to be when the fallout starts. Even under the worst assumptions most of the land a rea of the country will escape lethal fallout exposure. How- ever, it is only in these refuge locations that you can be confident that you personally will be missed. Outsi de of the refuges you might be missed by the fallout, or you might not. But don't forget that if the fallout doe s happen to descend in your area there are still many steps you can take to protect yourself. Personal Decisionmaking The series of decisions you will need to make befor e starting your disaster planning are presented in th e form of a dichotomous key—the \"Key to Survival.\" This is a sequence of questions in which the answer you choos e to The Key to Survival 1. Is your primary concern a nuclear war? Yes-2. No—23. 2. Consult Appendix A to locate the nuclear targets in your state and adjacent states. Do you live within ten tniles of a primary target (twenty miles if the tar get is listed with an asterisk)? Yes—3. No—14. 3. Are you willing to permanently move to a safer area? Yes—4. No—7. 4. Would you rather move to a local area that is just out of range of the primary weapon effects, or woul d you rather make a major move to a really safe part of the country? Major move—5. Local move—6. 5. Most retreaters seem to consider the Klamath region of northern California and southern Oregon a s about the safest place to go to avoid direct weapon s effects, fallout, and starving refugees. Actually, many other parts of the country are \"safe\" too, if you assume no fallout except from the missile fields. E ven if the Soviets hit all primary targets using surfac e bursts, there are still many parts of the nation wh ich have less than a 2 percent chance of receiving fall out. At this point you should select a possible area to move to and start over again at 2, answering each succee d- ing question as if you live in your prospective ref uge location. This will help you determine if you have selected wisely. a particular question tells you which question to a sk next. Eventually, the questions lead you to a sugge sted type of disaster planning which fits your particula r situation. Using the key is simple: look at question 1, \"Is yo ur primary concern a nuclear war?\" If it is, you proce ed to question 2. If not, you skip straight to question 2 3. Keep following the instructions given in each entry and the key will lead you to the information appropriate to your needs. 6. You will have to analyze your situation carefully t o select a local neighborhood where your risk from direct weapons effects and fallout will be minimal. As a first approximation you should consider moving to a location northwest of the target. If the target i s a single military base, such as a SAC bomber base, a distance of 25 miles should be sufficient to preser ve you from very much direct damage. For a Minuteman missile complex, however, I would suggest a 100-mil e minimum to the west, and 500 miles to the north, south, or east. The fallout generated by 400 or mor e megatons detonating at ground level is extensive. Select your new location and then return to 2. Star t again and answer each question as if you lived at y our selected location. 7. You live within ten (or twenty) miles of a primary target but don't want to permanently move some- where else. In the case of a nuclear attack, would you prefer to dig in at home or evacuate on warning? Dig in—8. Evacuate—9. 8. You will need to study chapter 2 and chapter 4 very carefully to select an appropriate fallout/ blast s helter for your location. Be sure to allow for the fact th at your house may collapse and burn, which means that it would be better to locate the shelter outside. I f your problem in finding an appropriate shelter is too di ffi- cult, I suggest that you reconsider and decide to e vac- uate.

You live within ten (or twenty) miles of a prima ry target and you intend to evacuate in the event of a nuclear attack. The next question is obviously . . . where? This in turn depends on when you will evacu- ate. Before the attack—10. After—13. 10. Are you willing to evacuate at the first sign of danger or will you wait until the last minute? Firs t warning—11. Last minute—12. 11. In general, you can expect to be forewarned to the extent of knowing a day or two ahead of the time of an attack (remember the days of tension during the Cuban missile crisis). If you are willing to head f or the hills as soon as things start to look hot, you can plan on driving to a refuge which is as much as ten to t welve hours away. The same time limit applies to flying, but of course the distance which can be covered is much greater. Go to 5. 12. If you would rather stick it out until the last pos sible moment, it might be possible to hop into your car a nd leave town in the last five minutes between the Civ il Defense alert and the explosion, but I don't recom- mend it. Your last-minute warning could come either from hearing your favorite AM/FM radio station suddenly cut off the air, or from the wailing beep of an emergency weather radio (which also reports atomic attack). Weather stations are illustrated in figure 9. Don't count on local sirens. Most of them don't wor k anymore, and we have all learned over the years to tune out the few sirens that do work. If you prefer not to leave until the last minute, your refuge had bet ter be within one hour's driving time of your home or office. That will give you just enough time to ente r a prepared shelter before any fallout arrives. Don't plan to fly out at the last minute; it would be suicidal . Go to 6. 13. If you wait until after the attack to evacuate, you will need a blast and fallout shelter appropriate t o your location (see chapter 4), local stockpiles of sup- plies sufficient until it is safe to evacuate (see chapter 5), a guaranteed route away from the city (or targe t), and someplace to go. Don't count on flying out afte r the attack because all light aircraft in your area will probably have been smashed by the blast wave. Driv- ing out could be a problem too, due to damage to automobiles and obstruction of streets. I would recommend evacuating ahead of time if possible, but as a back-up you should plan a route to your refuge that allows you to make use of backpacking, motor- cycles, or river rafting. As strange as these sugge stions sound, they are ways of leaving a shattered city wh ich do not require broad, clear streets. Having a frien d from out of town meet you with a car at a pre- arranged point would be best. Goto 5 and 6, then go back to 2 and begin again. 14. Do you live within ten miles of any secondary targe t (twenty miles if the target is listed with an aster isk)? Yes—15. No—16. 15. Secondary targets are likely to be hit because of their industrial importance. Sometimes this \"impor- tance\" is based on a local accident of geography wh ich concentrates railroad and highway routes along a valley, pass, or shoreline and has little to do wit h industrial output as we normally think of it. In mo st cases, however, we can reasonably expect that the Soviets will concentrate their missile strike on th e primary targets and people living near secondary targets will have a few hours of warning before the bombers arrive. This greatly improves chances of a successful last-minute evacuation, provided you hav e prepared ahead of time and can load a car quickly enough to beat the rush. (The last thing you want i s to be caught in a traffic jam while the Backfire bombe rs are closing in.) Using motorcycles to leave the cit y alleviates this problem, provided you have stocked a refuge out in the woods prior to the attack and do not have to carry all your supplies with you. The locat ion of your refuge relative to the secondary target sho uld insure that you will be out of range of thermal and blast effects; there is probably little danger of l ocal fallout. Go to 18. 16. Do you live within ten miles of a tertiary target (twenty miles if the target is listed with an aster isk)? Yes—17. No—18. 17. It would be best to make plans to evacuate to a saf e refuge, but there is the distinct possibility that tertiary targets will not be attacked. This puts a different complexion on your preparations. It would be a good idea to get out of town for a few days when things get bad, but you will probably be returning. An elabora te refuge off in the hills is not necessarily required . In most cases a fallout-free spot to pitch a tent for a week or two ought to do nicely. Notice that if you are i n an area subject to fallout from a primary target you c an't get away with just a tent and a flat space to put i t on. In that case, you might be better off to build a fa llout shelter at home and trust to luck that your city wo n't be attacked. Retreaters who don't believe in trusti ng to luck can still arrange for a permanent refuge in the hills. Go to 18. 18.

Shelter or trust to luck—46. 23. You are not primarily worried about a nuclear at- tack. This implies that you are more worried about something else. Natural disaster—24. Man-made disaster—36. Religious or supernatural disaster— 45. 24. Natural disasters may be earthquakes—25, tsu- namis— 26, tornadoes—27, hurricanes—28, floods— 29, droughts—30, crop failures—31, wildfires—32, volcanoes—33, epidemics—34 and blizzards—35. 25. The cardinal rule for surviving an earthquake is to stand in a doorway away from windows, shelves, or other items that could topple over or shatter and shower you with glass fragments. Usually you will have only a few seconds in which to reach such a location, so you should pick it out in advance. Sta tis- tically, the earthquake will probably catch you eit her at home in bed or at work. An earthquake can range from a minor inconvenience to a major disaster. To prepare for the worst, stockpile food and supplies for at least a month of self-sufficiency (see chapter 5 ). Figure 10 shows a map of earthquake danger areas in case you are not sure how much danger you are in. Notice that there are only three really safe areas. .. all of them in prime hurricane country. Go to 46. 26. The one obvious thing to keep in mind about tsu- namis is that you have to be near the ocean shore i n order to be threatened. If you live more than 200 f eet above sea level, you should be quite safe, unless y ou are adjacent to a bay with a long, narrow V-shape. Such bays can magnify the wave. In most areas sub- ject to tsunamis (such as Hawaii), the government h as well-maintained alert systems which predict the wav es and warn residents hours in advance. You should tak e precautions for a rapid evacuation as described for \"wildfire\" in 32. You will be in danger of being ta ken by surprise only if you live at the water's edge ne ar an active submarine fault (see the shoreline areas in fig- ure 10). If you live on an earthquake coast, don't buy a beach house. Go to 46. 27. Figure 11 shows the country's worst tornado danger areas. In the most dangerous area (central Okla- homa), the number of tornadoes can reach three to four per year in each fifty-mile square area. If yo u live in a tornado danger area, you should build a storm cellar in your backyard or construct a reinforced s hel- ter in the northeast corner of your basement. Torna - does usually travel from the southwest toward the northeast, making the northeast part of a building marginally safer than other locations. Some of the fallout shelters described in chapter 4 will also d ouble as tornado shelters, so why not build one shelter f or both purposes? An emergency weather radio with an automatic alarm would be a good investment, too. If your house is damaged and your community widely disrupted by one or more tornadoes, you will need t o provide temporary shelter (tents, etc.) as well as most of your own food, water, clothing, and other suppli es for a day or two at least and for possibly as much as a month. Read the rest of this book with these needs i n mind. Go to 46. 28. Hurricanes represent the natural disaster most sim- ilar to a nuclear attack. Surviving a hurricane mea ns either that you must seek specially constructed she lter or that you must flee. The effects occur over thou- sands of square miles and tax the preparedness of entire states. It isn't safe to go outside or to tr avel; the aftermath can take weeks to come under control. Fortunately, relatively few of us live in the most dan- gerous hurricane areas (see figure 12). My advice t o a retreater who fears hurricanes is to prepare food, clothing, gasoline, and makeshift shelter supplies in boxes or duffle bags that can be loaded very quickl y into a car (see 32). If a Civil Defense mass evacuat ion is under way, authorities will tell you where they think nearby safe areas will be, but I would be more incl ined to take a weekend trip entirely out of the danger region.

Floods can happen almost anywhere except on mountain peaks. Natural floods result from too much rain (or melting snow) all at once, and no one can be entirely safe from them. A measure of safety can be obtained, however, by deciding not to live within 1 00 vertical feet of the nearest major river, or within the boundaries of local \"100-year\" floods. Your county Civil Defense office can supply you with the inform a- tion appropriate to your location.

Stockpiling water isn't the answer unless you have the ability to do it on a grand scale. A solution more to the point would be to drill a deep well on your propert y or to invest in equipment for purifying brackish or po l- luted water into drinking water (see chapter 5). Th e main danger produced by drought is crop failure—31, or possibly widespread wildfire—32. first strike nuclear targets has been conspicuously neglected in terms of emergency warning stations. (Compare to figure 7.) 31. There is only one answer to a serious crop failure. As has been the case for a hundred thousand years, those of us who have stored a little extra food wil l be much better off than those who have not. A crop failure by itself will probably not produce serious problems in the United States, but even so, there could be nutritional and economic advantages to hav - ing a basement full of food after a really bad agri cul- tural year. Go to 46. 32. I have listed wildfire as a natural disaster, but a s an ecologist I personally regard runaway wildfires as man-made disasters. Forests used to burn naturally and surprisingly often, but the evidence suggests t hat most of these natural fires were not very dangerous . After half a century of fire suppression, however, our forests are so full of fuel that they burn violentl y and uncontrollably whenever they get a chance. (We have Smokey the Bear to thank for that.) If you live in a forested area or in dense chaparral you should take steps to be ready for an emergency evacuation.

Volcanoes are not a threat to you unless you ha ppen to be living next door to one. Even then, you proba bly have little to worry about, since almost all of the thousands of volcanoes in the United States are extinct. The exceptions are in the states bordering the Pacific Ocean, where there are several definitely a ctive volcanoes: Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier, and Mt. St. Hel- ens in Washington; Mt. Hood in Oregon; and Mt. Shasta, Lassen Peak, and Cinder Cone (near Lassen) in California. In addition, there are many others along the Cascades which are dormant. Mt. St. Hel- ens, northeast of Portland, erupted violently and repeatedly throughout the 1800s, producing gigantic flows of mud and ash. Since the last eruption, thre e hydroelectric dams have been built on the slopes of the mountain. Civil Defense planners are worried th at a future eruption may produce a mud flow over- whelming the uppermost dam, causing a chain reac- tion of dam failures that would flood the Portland area. The state of Hawaii is entirely composed of volcanoes, four of which are active: Haleakala on Maui; and Mauna Loa, Hualalai, and Kilauea on Hawaii. Alaska contains about forty active volca- noes, mainly concentrated in a single belt stretchi ng southwest from Anchorage to the outermost of the Aleutian Islands. The one outstanding lesson of vol - cano safety is that no one has ever died in a volca nic eruption who had the sense to leave early. If you w ait too long you could be caught in a trap like the one that engulfed Pompeii: volcanic ash that's too thick to breathe and too thin to walk on. Go to 46. 34. Epidemics concern me as a population ecologist because they are a primary natural remedy to over- population and because it has been so long since th e human race was subjected to a serious disease out- break.

How do you know if you are in danger from a fau lty dam? Obviously, appearances aren't worth anything. I would suggest that you have a close look at some detailed topographic maps of your area to see just where the dams and reservoirs are actually located. Be sure to check any ponds or lakes in the hills upstr eam of your position to see what keeps them from sud- denly draining. When you have a good idea of the distribution of such potential threats, go to visit your local Civil Defense director. My experience has bee n that local CD people are very helpful and can usual ly point out exactly where the floodwaters from a rup- tured dam are expected to go. They may also be able to advise you about large dams far upstream which might cause problems. In any case, your options are to move permanently to high ground or to relocate t o a motel on high ground during especially heavy rain storms. Dams are particularly vulnerable to failure when they are overfull or when they are filling for the first time. Go to 46. 38.

You can bet that if the reactor melts down and starts t o release radioactive materials into the air, you wil l be one of the last to know. The history of reactor acc i- dents clearly shows that the authorities don't like to say anything until it is impossible to keep silent any longer. It may only be in the future that the real circumstances of the Three Mile Island incident wil l be fully known; critics are already alarmed at the apparent lack of communication between controlling agencies. I suggest that you buy a radiation detect ion instrument and a gas mask or other respiration filt er as insurance. That way you can avoid inhaling dan- gerous particles while you find out for yourself ho w radioactive your neighborhood has become. As for the area which could be contaminated by a really ba d accident, the rules for nuclear weapons fallout do not apply.

Chemical spills from derailed trains are not usuall y much of a hazard except within half a mile or so of the wreck. If several train cars derail near your home I suggest that you pack up quickly and go visit Grandma until the trouble is cleared up (even if th e local authorities don't ask you to evacuate). About one train car in twenty-five carries explosive or t oxic chemicals, and many times the Civil Defense people don't know what is in the cars. If the wreck is two or three miles away you might get out your trusty gas mask and keep it handy for a while, and you should certainly carry it with you in the car if you have to drive past the wreckage. Individual gas masks are inexpensive and inconspicuous (stuff them in a pape r bag)\"and are good insurance for people who live nea r railroads. Go to 46. 41.

I had not seriously considered the possibility that a totalitarian government could arise in the United States until one day I met a retreater who keeps hi s passport in his pocket and refuses to travel more t han 200 miles away from the Canadian border. I thought he was a little paranoid, but as the saying goes, \" That doesn't mean they're not out to get you.\" After rea d- ing Executive Order 11490 I'm not quite as compla- cent about this subject. 4 In my opinion, flight from a repressive government is the wisest course. The Jew s who left Europe just before World War II made the right choice. Six million of their slower brethren paid the price of tardiness. Incidentally, when you hear the conservatives opposing gun control on the grounds that it leads to tyranny—they're right. Totalitaria n regimes do have a historical tendency to disarm the civilian population prior to throwing their weight around. Frequently they use very humanitarian argu- ments, too. If you are the sanguine type who would rather fight, there are many left-wing, right-wing, and military manuals available which will tell you exac tly how to go about it. Some of these are mentioned in chapter 7. Go to 46. 43. I put in a paragraph about personal attack because in some parts of the country the possibility of bei ng assaulted ranks very high on the list of things peo ple worry about. Obviously, one tries to avoid dark alleys, rowdy bars, slum neighborhoods, and walking alone at night. As for personal defense, there are really only two ways to go. You can spend several years learning to be a deadly martial artist or you can spend several weeks learning to be a deadly pistole ro. Karate gives one the advantage of being \"armed\" all the time without being in violation of the law. If that doesn't appeal to you, there is the pistol.

They buy United States common circulation silver coins and hoard them. Your local coin shop can help you find these. The main idea is that even if the d ollar suddenly becomes worthless, the silver in the coins will still have value. At present, the coins are wo rth LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 54 five times their face value, and they should contin ue to increase in value as the dollar becomes weaker. The second approach is to invest in \"trade goods\" to us e when bartering becomes necessary. I have usually heard this idea explained in terms of stockpiled ammunition (especially .22 caliber cartridges). In a survival situation, ammunition has an intrinsic val ue which might make it a substitute for money. The thi rd approach involves buying retreat property which can be farmed. The idea is to retreat to the hills and become entirely self-sufficient until the trouble i s over. People concerned about economic collapse usu- ally subscribe to one or more of the survivalist ne ws- letters devoted to this subject. Consult chapter 5 for discussion of these newsletters and other survival resources. One particularly good treatment of the subject is Howard Ruff's How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years. 5 Ruff does a very good job of describing the economic dangers ahead and pre- scribes personal financial strategies to cope with them.

Additional Considerations When retreaters plan the location of their refuges, they normally take into consideration factors other than direct and indirect nuclear weapons effects. Very f re- quently, the location of large population centers i s taken into consideration, as well as the availability of good water and suitable land for farming or gardening. W hich contributing factors are really important in select ing the retreat site? The first thing many retreaters point out is that t he refuge must be in a place that can be defended or i t isn't any good. I've thought a lot about this characteris tically immediate response and I am inclined to put it down to the fact that most retreaters tend to be extremely security-conscious.

The first pr iority, then, is arable land and dependable water. Once you have located a suitable area with these qualities, you can go on to the problem of defense; first make sure th at you have a piece of territory that is worth defending. What about those ravening hordes? Suppose there is a nuclear attack that leaves all those city-bred people without food and water? Won't they come to the coun try looking for something to eat? Well, maybe so—but maybe not. One point which is frequently overlooked by retreat planners is the damage to the routes of com muni- cation which a nuclear attack will cause. In most s tates, the main highways run right through the high-priori ty targets. If you compare California's nuclear target sites (a s illustrated in Appendix A), with the maps in figure 14, it becomes clear that virtually all the north-south ar teries in this state would be severed by an atomic attack. Any attack severe enough to drive unprepared refugees f rom their homes will also interfere seriously with thei r mobil- ity. There will be virtually no gasoline for them, remember. (A retreater always has a safe route, an alter- nate route, and plenty of gas.) It will be reasonab le to expect a few refugees following an attack, but not as many as you might be inclined to believe. There is one situation in which there could be a large number of refugees in your neighborhood, how- ever. If things start to look bad, the President mi ght order the cities to be evacuated as a precautionary move. Millions of people would head for the designated \"h ost communities\" as the Civil Defense authorities try t o execute their crisis-relocation plans. In that case , as a retreater in a secure area, you might suddenly have a score of refugees billetted with you by the local C ivil Defense command or the National Guard. You will not be able to legally refuse. This would be a situatio n where the war has not begun and might never start. Civili za- tion with all its laws and restrictions still stand s. You will have to take in the refugees assigned to you. What will you do then? A third topic concerns the possibility of retreatin g by boat. Persons who live in seacoast cities may di scover that their escape routes are severely limited by su rround- ing targets and the coast. This situation applies p articu- larly to potential retreaters living in the Boston- Wash- ington megalopolis, Miami, Houston, the suburbs of Los Angeles and San Francisco, and cities on the sh ores of the Great Lakes. If you can sail out to sea as l ittle as 20 miles off the California coast, you will be quite s afe from blast and fallout. On the east coast, a distance of 200 to 300 miles would be better.

Commentary What to do, where to go, and how to get there are the three primary questions retreaters face in begi nning to plan their refuges. The right decisions are cruc ial to success at this initial stage.

Poten tial interferences from refugees should be considered, b ut as a secondary factor.

The naked human being is vulnerable to a var iety of environmental injuries, such as hypothermia, fro st- bite, heat stroke, dehydration, sunburn, and others which contribute to death by \"exposure.\" In spite o f our high standing on the evolutionary scale, we still s hare with the lower animals the absolute necessity of be ing able to get in out of the weather now and then. Whe n we cannot, we are in serious trouble. There are special kinds of shelters which are asso- ciated with extremely violent weather and the vario us effects of nuclear weapons. Even within structures which are satisfactory in terms of normal shelter requirements, we are still vulnerable to the over 2 00 mile-per-hour winds of hurricanes and the blast, th er- mal pulse, and radioactivity of nuclear detonation. For these situations, special kinds of shelter must be pro- vided, and sometimes in a hurry. This chapter covers the topic of shelter from the standpoint of protecting the vulnerable human body from all the possible external conditions which cou ld threaten it. The discussion is focused mainly on th e needs of the person who is preparing for nuclear wa r, but the interests of those concerned with natural d isas- ters are served in this context as well. Permanent shel- ters, expedient shelters, and special purpose shelt ers are examined with the intention of exploring a variety of designs to suit every need and pocketbook. First, h ow- ever, some principles of protection will be discuss ed. Basic Principles of Radiation and Thermal Protection The basic principle of any kind of shelter is to provide a local environment in which conditions are more comfortable or more healthy than those prevail ing outside. The principles of shielding a human being from gamma ray penetration and the thermal heat pulse of nuclear weapons are exceptional, however, and requi re at least a brief analysis. Gamma rays are electromagnetic rays very similar to light except that they are invisible, contain ex tremely high amounts of energy, and can freely penetrate mo st objects. You might think of fallout particles in th is context as being little shining light sources, emit ting a light to which most materials are transparent or tr anslu- cent. If you were to hold a piece of waxed paper up between your eye and a candle, you would be able to see the light of the candle through the paper. If you u sed two layers of paper, the amount of light reaching your eye would be less. If you were to use twenty or thirty layers of waxed paper, you could block out the light entir ely. Similarly, with gamma rays, the key to protection i s to get the right amount of material between you and th e fallout. For gamma shielding, the general rule of thumb is to build a mass barrier with a density of 150 pound s per square foot between you and the radiation source (s ee figure 15). This means if you were to draw a one fo ot square on the surface of a wall, and then cut that one foot square chunk out of the wall and weigh it, it would have to weigh 150 pounds or more in order to shield you effectively from fallout on the other side of the w all. Notice that the thickness of the wall doesn't reall y mat- ter, nor does the composition of the material in th e wall. A foot of concrete or twenty feet of snow (150 poun ds in each case) will shield you to about the same extent . The second principle of gamma ray shielding is to put as much distance between yourself and the fallo ut particles as possible. The gamma rays from any part icu- lar fallout particle spread out as they get farther and farther from the particle. If you increase the dist ance between yourself and the fallout particle by a fact or of two, the gamma exposure you will receive from that particle will fall off by a factor of four (2x2 = 4 ). At three times the distance you will get only 1 /9th the exp osure (3x3 = 9). At ten times the distance, you receive o nly 1 / 1 0 0 t h the exposure. This rule (called the \"invers e 57 HOME SWEET HOLE"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"square law\") becomes somewhat obscured when you start talking about large areas contaminated by fal lout particles, but the general effect holds true. If yo u can get some distance between you and the fallout, you can greatly reduce your exposure whether or not you hav e mass shielding. The third principle of gamma ray shielding is geometry. A house built in the side or top of a con vex hill is naturally protected from fallout radiation by the geometry of its position. Fallout particles on the slopes of the hill have a tremendous mass of earth between them and the inhabited portions of the house. Only those particles which actually fall in the immediat e vicinity of the house pose any threat. This kind of effect can greatly reduce radiation exposure. By the same token, the edges of a basement floor near the exterior walls are usually better protecte d than the center of the basement, but this depends on the size of the house. If you were to lie down on the baseme nt floor against the wall, the gamma rays from the nea rest fallout particles on the soil surface next to the f ounda- tion wall would have to travel diagonally downward through several feet of earth and concrete to reach you (see figure 16). At this point, it should begin to be obvious why most home fallout shelters are built in basements. In the basement, the designer can take advantage of the fo un- dation walls for mass shielding. The distance from the basement shelter to the fallout on the roof can hel p to reduce exposure. Finally, by placing the shelter in a corner or against a foundation wall, the designer c an increase protection through geometry. These are the principles of radiation shielding to keep in mind w hen considering shelter designs. The effectiveness of a fallout shelter is usually expressed as a protection factor or \"PF.\" A PF of 4 0, for example, means that persons inside the shelter rece ive only l/40th of the radiation that is present outsid e. PF 40 is the standard protection factor for home fallo ut shelters, established by the Office of Civil Defens e in 1962. With these principles in mind, there are several FIGURE 15: Principles of Gamma Ray Protection. Radi ation expo- sure can be limited by mass shielding, distance, an d geometry.

The P F provided by a concrete foundation wall increases greatly as the basement floor is approached. Radiation must pass through several fee t of earth and concrete to penetrate the wall at such a steep angl e. The insert shows precautions which you can employ in the landscaping of your property to cut down on the amount of fallout radiation which will be able to penetrate your home . The radiation resistance of a house can be greatly incr eased by banking earth up around the house. This can be d one by skillfully using wide planters, raised concrete or flag- stone porches, and large terrace patios. Don't make these barriers more than about ten feet wide or you will catch so much fallout in them that their shielding effect will be reduced. The idea is to provide a slightly elevated mass barrier between the interior of the house and the fallout in the surrounding yard (see figure 17). Additional radiation resistance can be provided by nearby outbuildings which interpose mass between th e house and portions of the yard, and which elevate f all- out particles on their roofs, increasing the distan ce between the particles and the interior of the house . The paved surfaces of a porch or terrace patio lend the m- selves to easy decontamination with a garden hose, allowing much of the fallout to be washed away from the immediate vicinity of the house. A swimming pool ca n overall PF values within a one-story wood frame hou se. (Insert after Shelter Designs in New Buildings, Office of Civil D efense, TR-43, March 1967—D119.9:43.) help increase decontaminated area because fallout which lands in a pool sinks to the bottom and is sh ielded by the water. Massive but decorative garden walls c an be used to shield a house from portions of the yard. T hese walls do not have to be tall, but they should be fa irly thick and constructed of solid masonry. Trees surrounding a house contribute to radiation resistance, too, by catching the fallout in their l eaves and holding it high up in the air away from the inhabit ed portion of the house. Just as in the case of adjace nt roof tops which increase the distance between the fallou t and your basement shelter, tall trees also produce a di stance effect and can cut down the amount of gamma radiati on entering the house by a significant factor. What about shielding against thermal effects? The thermal pulse of a nuclear explosion is a very brie f but very intense flash of radiated heat which occurs at the instant of detonation. The damage caused by this pu lse of heat is usually confined to the surface of the h ouse which faces toward the fireball, and in many cases the damage is limited to instantaneous surface charring . 59 HOME SWEET HOLE "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" FIGURE 17: Landscaping for Protection. Landscaping can help make a house resistant to fallout radiation, nuclear bla st, and thermal pulse. (After Reducing the Vulnerability of Homes, Office of Civil Defense, PG-80-11, August 1963—D13.8/6:80-11.) Sometimes when kindling material or loose papers ar e lying around, this pulse can result in the ignition of small fires, which subsequently spread. Protecting a building from thermal pulse is rela- tively simple. Tests at the Nevada proving grounds and actual experience recorded in Japan have shown that most exposed portions of a house are not likely to catch fire following a thermal pulse—even though the side of the house facing the explosion may be badly charred . The depth of charring is not usually great enough t o sustain subsequent burning. In fact, in some very i ntense explosions, the charring occurs so abruptly that th e surface of the wall is literally \"exploded\" away, l eaving the bulk of the wall intact and unheated. Houses pa inted white can withstand much greater thermal exposure than can dark colored or weatherbeaten structures. If you are building a house, it is a good idea to orient it so that the smallest side faces the direc tion of the nearest nuclear target; this means that the hou se will be exposed to the least possible dynamic pressure a nd thermal heating. Most people don't have much say about what direction their house faces, though. If you have a choice, however, try to point a narrow side of the building toward the closest danger area. The value of plants in resisting thermal damage is rarely considered but can be of overwhelming impor- tance. A stand of shade or fruit trees in the porti on of the yard between the house and the presumed nuclear tar get could intercept most of the incoming thermal pulse, and although it might catch on fire, it would protect t he house. A hedge set a few feet away from the side of the house would serve the same purpose. Be sure that th e side of the house exposed to the thermal pulse does not have any bushes or trees growing right against it, how- ever, since the plants could ignite easily and then spread the fire to the house. Fires which begin inside the house are more likely to result in the destruction of the building than a re exterior fires. Such fires are ignited by heat rays passing in through glass windows or open doors. You can tak e two approaches toward cutting down this hazard. One is to install heat-reflecting (solar) glass or opaque cover- LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 60 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ings over the windows. Venetian blinds or thick whi te draperies will do, especially if you splash water o n the draperies during the danger period. Ordinary window glass will not reflect enough of the heat to signif icantly cut down the fire potential. The second approach is to furnish the exposed rooms of the building with materials that are flame - resistant. Tests have shown that houses furnished w ith rayon and cotton catch fire easily when exposed to a flash of heat, but houses furnished with vinyl plas tics and wool resist ignition. Some fires do occur in th e latter case, but these are minor and tend to be self-limit ing. Fires from the thermal pulse take several minutes t o start, so if your home will be exposed to this dang er you should make plans to spend the first few minutes af ter the explosion searching for and extinguishing these fires. (Wait until after the blast effects have sub sided.) Be careful if you go outside during this period, si nce there is the possibility of subsequent detonations. This is a risky business, but if you don't catch the fir es in the first few minutes, they can get out of control. In any case, several large fire extinguishers would be a g ood investment. Permanent Interior Ground-level Shelters I want to discuss built-in ground floor shelters fi rst to dispel a widely held notion that fallout shelter s (or storm shelters) are vaults buried in the ground, so me- thing like mausoleums. The design presented here is intended to be incorporated directly in the constru ction of an average house without a basement. The importa nt thing to note here is that although the house has a built-in fallout shelter, no one but you and the co ntrac- tor need to know about it. Mass shielding is built into the walls and ceiling in such a way that nothing ou t of the ordinary is detectable. The design illustrated in figure 18 is for a one-st ory house built on a concrete slab. Several of the inte rior walls surrounding the bath-utility area have been m ade of foot-thick reinforced concrete. These walls can be finished in brick, paneling, plaster, or whatever y ou like. The extra thickness is noticeable only in the doorw ays and can be disguised even there to avoid the \"monol ith\" look. The shelter area is capped with a slab of rei nforced concrete a foot thick, which is poured in place to inter- lock with the walls and provide extra structural st rength FIGURE 18: Permanent Ground Floor Shelter. This she lter is built (luring the construction of the house by substituti ng reinforced con- crete for conventional materials in several interio r walls.

This shelter is constructed by filling normal interior walls with sand or grave l.

This interior module would certainly survive the re st of the house in the event of a tornado or hurricane; i t provides a radiation PF of about 40. This would be enough to insure the survival of a family unlucky enough to live in an area receiving as much as 6,00 0 R during the first two weeks after an atomic attack. I have deliberately selected a bathroom shelter design to underline an important point. If you have to stay in a single room for several days or weeks, it would be nice if the room had running water and a toilet. Many areas of the United States will not lose their util ities during a fallout or storm crisis, and the use of a bathroom as a shelter could add to the comfort of t he experience. Just be sure there is enough room to al low everyone in the family to lie down to sleep. Permanent Interior Basement Shelters 1 suspect that just about everybody has seen the type of concrete block bunker which was so popular in the 1960s as a permanent basement fallout shelter, and which amounted to little more than a dark, damp hov el LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 62 "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"to huddle in. I have selected a different kind of b uilt-in shelter as an example of a more enlightened design (see figure 19). This shelter can be built as part of a new house for about 500 dollars or so, depending on loc al costs and the exact dimensions of the room to be shielded. The mass shielding of this shelter is made of hollo w plywood walls filled with dry sand or gravel. The c eiling mass is provided by making bins out of the normal f loor joists and filling them, too, with sand or gravel. I favor this design for several reasons. The first is that a person building a house or remodeling a basement could bui ld such a shelter without attracting attention to thes e efforts. Also, the finished shelter is quite undete ctable. Depending on the circumstances, an adequate PF can be achieved with walls only four to six inches thick. (The physical location of the shelter in a basement make s up for the lack of mass in the walls.) There are two additional reasons why this design appeals to me. The first is that the bins of sand o verhead can be replaced with galvanized water tanks. The wa ter will not provide as much shielding as sand, but you r situation might allow for less shielding in order t o store more water. The second reason is that putting sand in overhead bins strikes me as safer than creating the same overhead mass by storing bricks or concrete blocks in such bins, as many designers suggest. If a shock wa ve or earthquake should happen to rupture one of those bi ns, it would be nice to have a cascade of sand, gravel, or water rather than a rockfall of concrete blocks. Remember who will be under it. Permanent Exterior Ground-level Shelters If you don't plan to build a new house in the near future, you might be interested in building a perma nent fallout/tornado/ hurricane shelter outside your hom e in the backyard. The design presented in figure 20 is a very solid above-ground fallout shelter which can be use d as a workshop, garden tool shed, potting shed, or chan ging area next to the swimming pool. The walls are twent y- inch thick concrete block capped with an eight-inch reinforced concrete slab. A wooden shingled roof co vers the ceiling slab and gives it a more traditional appearance. The shelter can be made either with or without windows; in areas subject to very high winds (or nu clear blast) you will want as little window space as poss ible. The windows and door can be shielded from gamma radiation by placing loose stacks of concrete block s in them, but a hurricane or tornado would simply blow these away. An atomic blast could pick up the brick s and fling them into the shelter with a great deal of fo rce. If you expect high winds or blast effects, you should leave windows out. Aside from the loose brick baffles, th is shelter was designed to resist blast effects as sev ere as five pounds per square inch overpressure as close as fou r miles to a 1-megaton burst. It should also withstan d winds over 150 miles per hours, although the decora tive roof would, of course, be blown off. One point of particular interest in this design is the ventilation openings near the top of the walls. In chapter 7, I'll discuss the defense of a refuge, but for no w it is sufficient to say that these ventilation ducts coul d be easily modified to form very useful loopholes. If t hat kind of thing is important to you, take a closer lo ok at this design. Permanent Exterior Below-ground Shelter The permanent, buried exterior shelter provides the best protection from winds, blast, and radiation yo u can obtain, and at a reasonably low cost. Constructed a s a part of a new house, such a shelter will add about 1,000 dollars to the cost of the house while providing a fallout PF of 1,000. For those of you living less than 500 miles to the east of Minuteman missile silos, a very high protection factor is a good idea. A good buried she lter would protect you against a cumulative exposure of 150,000 to 200,000 R. This is enough to kill every other living thing in your neighborhood, crabgrass includ ed. The design shown in figure 21 was initially intende d to provide a PF of 40, but an option is to cover th e roof slab with three feet of dirt. This is where the PF 1,000 comes from, so don't overlook that portion of the p lan. No provision is made in this plan for water or sanitation, or even for internal drainage. 1 visite d a shelter of this design tucked away under an expensi ve house in Pacific Grove, California and was surprise d to find two inches of water standing on the floor. It seems that the hatch over the door leaked rain and the wa ter had no way to run out. Be sure to include a floor d rain in your plans. Even so, with some modification and attention to detail, this could be a very useful shelter, either as an initial part of the construction of a house or as a later addition. I don't like the look of the air vents wh ich protrude and form first-class eyesores, advertising the presence of a \"bomb shelter.\" I would be inclined t o mask the vents inside shrubbery or disguise them as part of permanent patio light stanchions, tetherball pol es, or beach umbrella poles. Anything to make them less co n- spicuous. The hatch might also be redesigned to form the wooden top of a masonry bench or table, perhaps as part of a barbeque area next to the patio. (My intention in this suggestion is not only to make the presence of the shelter unobvious, but to remove the aspects of she lter design which are positively annoying. If you like t rap- doors and air pipes springing out of the ground in your backyard, you are welcome to them. I prefer more natural-looking surroundings.) 63 HOME SWEET HOLE"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" FIGURE 20: Permanent Exterior Ground Level Shelter.

It is best to build an underground shelter as far from nearby buildings as possible so they do not co l- lapse on top of the hatch as a result of wind or bl ast effects. If you desire, however, this kind of shelt er can be built right next to the house with a door directly into the basement. In areas where no blast is likely, this a rrange- ment would be preferred because it allows access to the interior of the house without exposing anyone to co n- tamination by fallout particles. Prefabricated Basement Fallout Shelters Prefabricated fallout shelters can provide adequate protection from fallout in most areas if the shelte r is located in a corner of a basement where the outside ground level is well above the roof of the shelter. A prefabricated shelter is simply a collection of she lter parts which serve other purposes until the time whe n they are needed for radiation barriers. The virtues of prefabricated shelters are that the materials are inexpensive (up to about 400 dollars 1978 prices), they can be installed in any basement by t he homeowner, and it is not really necessary to do any thing but buy the components and keep a copy of the plans . If hard work isn't your bag, you can stack the pieces away and know that they will be there when you need them . The design discussed in this section is described a s pro- viding shelter for four persons and requiring only twenty man-hours to build. A frantic family of four could assemble it in an hour. This is the Basement Concrete Block Shelter illus- trated in figure 22. It is a vault built in the cor ner of a basement from concrete blocks and a few pieces of wood. The official Civil Defense construction plans assume that you will mortar the blocks together to form a permanent shelter in the corner of your basement, but this is not necessary. If your home is not within a short blast radius of any target, there is no need to use mor- tar. (If it is subject to blast, your shelter shoul dn't be in the basement anyway.) Just stack the blocks dry and fill them with sand. If you go to the trouble of cutting and labeling all the wood parts ahead of time, you can assemble the shelter and occupy it in about an hour . If you don't live near any target, you should have at least that much warning before receiving any fallout. 65 HOME SWEET HOLE "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" FIGURE 22: Prefabricated Basement Concrete Block Sh elter.

Underground Homes as Whole-building Shelters For those readers who will take the idea of persona l blast/fallout/weather shelters extremely seriously, I would like to point out that the technology now exi sts to build new homes in such a way that the entire house is a \"shelter\" in every sense of the word. I am referrin g to underground homes. For those of you who may be interested, under- ground houses are basically simple solar designs bu ilt of reinforced concrete and buried partially or wholly beneath ground level (see figure 23). Do not get th e idea that they are vaults, however; underground houses a re just as light, warm, open, and dry as conventional wood- frame houses. They have picture windows opening out onto the hillside, sunken patios and gardens open t o the sky, and numerous skylights. The underground houses I have seen have had more window space than most con- ventional houses. The advantages of underground structures (other than as shelters) stem from the thermal insulative prop- erties of soil and the inexpensiveness of concrete. Depending on who designs the house, the total cost of construction can be as much as 20 percent less than a wooden house of the same size. If you go to a high- priced architect who has grandiose ideas, the cost over- run can be equally high. The long-term savings, however, make up for any additional expense. Becaus e the temperature of a house is buffered by the surro und- ing soil, an underground home can be heated and coo led very efficiently. In one experiment, the owner of a n underground house in Illinois turned off the heat f or two weeks when outside temperatures were about 40 degre es below zero. The house lost about 1 degree a day. A standard home would have been freezing in a few hou rs. Fuel economy is outstanding. From the standpoint of fallout, there are several advantages to a whole-house shelter. A typical unde r- ground design has all the shelter potential of a st andard FIGURE 23: Underground Home. Not designed with fall out protec- tion in mind, this home still provides excellent ra diation shielding with easily decontaminated patio and pool areas.

Even without any serious attempt to maxim ize the shelter potential, the deeper portions of a typ ical subterranean home provide protection well in excess of a PF of 40, the standard set by the Office of Civil Defense. As for blast resistance, in experiments co n- ducted at the Nevada test site, buried concrete str uctures withstood up to 200 pounds per square inch overpres - sure. This is a pressure high enough to kill any un pro- tected humans outright, and corresponds to that at a location only half a mile from the center of a 1-me gaton burst. This is within the radius of the fireball I do not suggest that a typical residential underground hous e (or its inhabitants) would survive this kind of treatme nt, but the potential is there and could be exploited. The main vulnerability of underground houses to the effects of nuclear weapons is the windows and s ky- lights. Of course, you could design the house with an interior area that could be completely sealed off, but for my money, it would be worth it to make the whole ho use resistant to blast and radiation. The architects wh o com- peted in the 1960s fallout shelter design contests sug- gested several answers to the problem of protecting windows; these deserve some discussion here. One common suggestion was to construct rolling panels of concrete which could be pushed into posit ion across the vulnerable windows prior to an attack (s ee figure 24). These panels were to be at least eight inches thick and would have to run on steel tracks. Anothe r approach was to mount the concrete panels on pivots and place them within the outer portion of each win dow or doorway. In an emergency the panels could be rotated a quarter turn, effectively blocking off th e opening. There were two suggestions that I thought might be particularly useful. One of them, described to me b y Cresson Kearny of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , was to cast concrete panels horizontally on the gro und in front of each window, as if the concrete were to form part of a sidewalk. Since the windows of an under- ground house are frequently set at grade level, in an emergency these cast-to-fit concrete slabs could be jacked upright to cover the windows. This seems lik e a simple solution which could even be applied to exis ting basement windows. A similar but expedient approach is to cover the windows with logs, lumber, or door pan els and then pile an earthen berm against them. Obvious ly, this would take time, perhaps several days in some cases. A really original suggestion was part of an award- winning school fallout shelter design. The idea was to cast the roof of a building as a single slab of con crete and support it at the corners with hydraulic jacks. The win- dows make a wide band of glass just below the level of the roof all the way around the building. In the ev ent of a crisis, the jacks are used to lower the roof right down on top of the walls, covering the vulnerable windows a nd essentially sealing the building. The windows were designed to slip up inside the lip of the roof so t hat they would not be crushed. I think that the potential for underground housing has not been properly appreciated by the public in gen- eral; the shelter aspects of underground living mak e a close examination of these possibilities necessary. I keep wondering if the time will come when the individual s who built underground homes will be the only people capable of normal, comfortable day-to-day living. T iny fallout shelters are adequate for survival, but it would be much better during such trying times to have the ru n of an entire house. Weathering the crisis within the f amiliar surroundings of home can be a great psychological p lus. Expedient Interior Shelters If you are reading this book, I can't imagine that you are the complacent type who will one day be cau ght with no fallout protection at all, but a war might start while you are on vacation with relatives—or you mig ht be forced to evacuate from your home—so a few words about building a fallout shelter from nothing are i n order. The basic idea is to enclose a space with as much mass as you can scrape together. This is best done in a basement, where the natural shielding of the surrou nd- ing earth provides substantial protection even with out additional efforts on your part. Two approaches to constructing a makeshift shelter in a basement are shown in figure 25. A sturdy workbench or a table formed of chests of drawers topped by two or three interior doors can be used as a platform on which t o pile up everything heavy you can find. Drawers and boxes filled with dirt are best, but newspapers, books, f ire- wood, tools, or anything that is heavy may be used. Your goal is to pile 150 pounds of material on every squ are foot of the table and in front of every square foot of the sides of your shelter. Piling up heavy furniture in the room over the shelter location or filling up a bath tub or child's wading pool in the room over the shelter ca n help achieve the needed mass. (If you can get your water bed into the room over the shelter, that would be excel lent protection.) Shielding of this sort provides a PF o f about 40. If the house does not have a basement and there is no time or no way to reach better shelter, a makesh ift shelter can be constructed in the center of the fir st floor (see figure 26). Again, the plan is to pile heavy t hings on top of a sturdy table to achieve a mass of 150 poun ds per square foot. This is a poor shelter, but it will be better than no shelter at all. If you have garbage pails o r wastebaskets, you can fill them with water and take them into the shelter space with you—if you sit and hug a garbage can full of water, one whole side of you will be 69 HOME SWEET HOLE"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" FIGURE 25: Two Expedient Basement Shelters.

In most kinds of shelters, one tries to be sure that t here will be enough space for each person to feel comfortable , but in a ground-level makeshift shelter like this, the more crowded you get the safer you will be. Remember tha t radiation sickness can be significantly reduced if any large part of your body can be protected. Arrange y our few really good shields to protect your legs if you can. Undamaged marrow in your leg bones might pull you through, even though the rest of your body is sever ely irradiated. For those of you who will be seeking shelter from blast and fallout radiation in apartment buildings, there are some special considerations to keep in mind. In multiple-story buildings (six or more floors), the base- ment is often deep enough, large enough, and far en ough from the roof to provide exceptionally high radiati on protection (a PF of over 200). Interior areas of fl oors about halfway up the building are also very good fa llout shelters because of the distance between them and t he fallout particles on the roof and on t he ground. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 70 over the shelter; a supply of children's wading poo ls can be very effective in creating overhead mass. (After Persona l and Family Survi- val, Office of Civil Defense, SM-3-11, June 1966.) Remember that nearby roofs will catch fallout parti cles and raise the effective \"ground\" level. Keep this i n mind when you select the story to use as your refuge (se e figure 27). A few special locations in a multiple story buildin g are particularly well protected. The very center of an intermediate floor, the central core of an \"X\"-shap ed building, and the windowless interior room formed b y an \"L\"-shaped building are all especially good plac es to take refuge (but only on intermediate-level floors) . As mentioned before, a basement or sub-basement is by far the best shelter if it is available. When a blast w ave hits a modern high-rise building, there is a tendency for the contents of the upper stories to be blown sideways through the walls and out of the building. Use the base- ment if you expect blast. Expedient Exterior Fallout and Blast Shelters A far better way to deal with the threat of nuclear attack than using interior space is to build an exp edient fallout and blast shelter outside in your back yard or in some other small vacant area of land.

Even a simple open trench about four feet deep provides a PF of 10. Two designs for expedient exterior shelters invented and tested by researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory are particularly useful. Both a re intended to be built by an average family of four, using only hand-powered tools and materials which are lik ely to be found in the home. The first design, the Door-over-Trench Shelter, consists of a trench dug in firm ground which is co vered with door panels and then buried under three feet o f mounded earth. With suitably constructed makeshift blast doors, the fallout PF of this shelter is abou t 1,000— and it will resist blast pressures up to about 15 p ounds per square inch, the equivalent of a 300 to 400 mil e per hour wind. Although the door panels are very flimsy , the earth over them forms an arch and supports its own weight as the doors sag. The strength of this natur al earth arch is amazing. One of the tests the Oak Rid ge researchers conducted involved burying the do or- covered trench under six feet of dirt and driving a heavy piece of earth moving equipment up on top of the mound. The doors held. The Door-over-Trench Shelter has been success- fully field-tested on two occasions. In the first i nstance, a father who had never dug a trench before completed the shelter within thirty-six hours of receiving the in struc- tions. His wife was an invalid, and he was assisted by only one little girl. On the second occasion, a fat herless family worked together to build the shelter in only thirty-four hours. These building times could be gr eatly reduced by any increase in the number of workers, t heir experience, or the quality of the tools available t o them. A roto-tiller could greatly speed up the excavation of the trench, for instance. The second design is the Car-over-Trench Shelter; it makes use of the same principle as the Door-over - Trench design. Suppose you must leave your home in a hurry, evacuating in the family car to a remote ref uge. (Local Civil Defense authorities have the power to force you to evacuate in some areas.)

The car is driven over the trench to form a roof, after which the int erior, the trunk, and the top of the hood are filled with dirt to provide overhead shielding.

This is not a blast-resi stant shelter, but it can make you safe from fallout for the few days during which you would need protection. The Car-over-Trench Shelter was field-tested in Colorado in the winter of 1973 by a couple with one nine-year-old child.

The manual contains complete plans for fifteen expe di- ent shelters, housing from 2 to 100 people, constru cted of almost every imaginable material from living roo m rugs to moving vans. Truly an expedient shelter for every pocketbook. FIGURE 27: Preferred Shelter Locations. In a multip le-story apart- ment or office building, the areas shown are most p rotected from radiation.

The Ultimate Expedient Shelter What if I were to tell you that there was a well-ma de fallout shelter waiting for you, and all you had to do is spend 50 cents on a key for the door in order to ta ke possession? Furthermore, that this shelter is made of I reinforced concrete and is proof against very high levels of blast and heat as well as fallout? Sounds unbeli eva- ble? It's true. If you live in a suburban area with paved streets a nd underground utilities, you also have a plentiful su pply of manholes. Beneath each manhole is a small under- ground room or possibly a six-foot diameter drainpi pe, either of which will serve admirably as a shelter f rom nuclear effects. All you have to do to gain access to this haven is to get the lid up. These lids are made of very thick s teel, intended to support the weight of trucks and buses, and they are not light. Usually, though, a motivated ad ult can pull open a manhole cover by using a simple \"ke y\" made of two bolts and a short length of steel cable or rope. Tie the cable between the centers of the bolt s (making an \"H\"). Then insert one bolt through the h ole in the edge of the cover. Jiggle it around inside t o get it crosswise under the hole, use the other bolt as a h andle, and pull the cover off. Simple. Some manholes do lead to sewers, of course, but others are nice and dry and clean. It pays to do so me shopping around. Expedient Shelter on the Farm Unfortunately, the lethal effects of ionizing radia - tion are not confined to humans. Most large mammals react to fallout radiation about the same way peopl e do; therefore, they need shelter in the event of atomic attack. Obviously, you cannot afford to build extensive und er- ground facilities to house your herd of cattle or f lock of sheep, so any shelter for the animals will have to be makeshift. The key to protecting livestock is to get them indoors where you can keep the fallout from getting into their coats. If you can prevent contact beta burns from the fallout, you have solved half of the problem. T he beta burns from fallout particles can produce large open sores which are extremely vulnerable to infect ion. You must also keep the fallout out of the animals' feed for at least two weeks following the attack, even i f it means starving them. (You will have to supply water , of course, contaminated or not.) This will prevent int ernal burns and will help reduce radioactive damage to th e thyroid from iodine-131. The second half of the problem is to shield the animals from penetrating gamma radiation (see figur e 28). If you herd the animals into a barn in a crowd ed group, you can achieve some degree of self-shieldin g; the animals in the center will be partially protected b y the LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 72 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" The door to the ultimate in expedient fallout and b last shelters, along with a \"key\" for opening it (a crowbar works, too).

Fill ing the loft with hay, wetted if the barn will stand th e strain, will help provide overhead mass. Most barn roofs ar e high enough to produce some distance attenuation of radiation. You will have to shield the sides of the barn with an earthen berm if possible, piled to a depth of three feet or more against the sides of the barn. If the barn is constructed of concrete, some additional sheltering effect may be achieved by stacking sandbags in the windows. Hosing off the roof of the barn after the fallout has stopped will greatly increase the prote ction, but don't even think about it unless you can rinse off the barn without exposing yourself to a significant dos e of radiation in the meantime. In many rural areas, the initial fallout concentration will be light enough to allow you to run out for a few minutes before diving back into your fallout shelter. Be sure that your dosimeter i s work- ing properly before you try it, however, and make c er- tain that you have proper anti-contamination clothi ng to wear. (Radiation equipment is discussed in chapt er 8.) Boats and Airplanes as Shelters Obviously, it is not a good idea to choose a small boat or a private plane as a shelter from a severe storm or from the blast effects of a nuclear explosion. I n terms of fallout, however, there are situations in which a boat or plane could be used as a refuge from gamma radia - tion, at least temporarily. With a little preparation, a small sailboat can be successfully used as a fallout shelter (see figure 29). This fact derives from the tendency of fallout grains (w hich resemble sand) to sink when they land in the water. This makes the surface of a large lake or an ocean self- shielding, because once the fallout particle has su nk through five or six feet of water, it is effectivel y nullified as a source of radiation. People on a boat, therefo re, would only need to be worried about the fallout par ticles which land directly on the boat itself. Even withou t taking any steps to wash away this fallout, their e xpo- sure would only be about 20 percent of what they wo uld have received on shore. To reduce the dose even more, the boat should be anchored several hundred yards from shore and cover ed with a waterproof rain fly. By rinsing off this fly periodi- cally while the fallout is arriving, the inhabitant s of the boat can greatly cut down their exposure. With more advanced preparation, retreaters could rig up a pum p and sprinkler system to automatically wash off the rain fly—without human intervention. Some provision should be made to inject a little detergent into th e spray water to help dislodge the fallout grains and to br eak up the surface tension of the water around the boat. M ost of the smaller particles that might otherwise have remained as a layer of dust on the surface of the w ater will then sink. My model for this discussion is a twenty-seven foot sailboat with a small cabin, arranged with a walkwa y FIGURE 29: Sailboat Fallout Shelter. This plan is a scaled down version of a technique currently employed by the Un ited States Navy. (A) Remotely controlled sprinklers rinse fallout of f the boat.

I would sug- gest piling the supplies, particularly the water ju gs, on the bunks to form a makeshift radiation shield at t he level of the waterline. The people should try to st ay down as low as possible on the deck area between th e bunks, in the space which is normally below the wat er- line. This is the best-shielded location on the boa t. Remember that if there are too many people to fit i nto this area in a prone position, you can still succes sfully beat the radiation by keeping at least the lower ha lf of your body well shielded. Don't just put the kids do wn there and sit it out above the waterline yourself. What survival potential has an orphan, after all? The usefulness of an airplane as a radiation shelte r is limited. For those of you who anticipate flying away to a remote refuge, however, there is one very impo rtant thing to realize about fallout radiation. Since fal lout is like sand, it sifts down out of the air fairly rapi dly; a few hours after a detonation, the amount of fallout in the air over the target or immediately downwind of it is ve ry small. By that time, most of the particles have set tled to the ground. A person flying over the contaminated a rea at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (relative to the local ground level) is so far removed from the radioactiv e material on the ground that the dose received is on ly about 1/1,000th of the ground level dose (see figur e 30). This means that it is safe to fly across contaminat ed areas which would be lethal to cross on foot or in a car. If you pick your time wisely and avoid flying through a FIGURE 30: Airplane Radiation Shelter. The distance between a plane in flight and fallout particles on the ground provides excellent protection.

Special Shelter Topics If we agree that the term \"shelter\" means a refuge from a hostile external environment, a broad range of possible circumstances and special protections beco me appropriate for discussion. These cases include sim ple protections from cold, rain, wind, heat, and sun, a s well as more exotic precautions against the danger of no x- ious gases, radioactive dust, nuclear thermal flash effects, and flooding. If you are subject to any threat which means that you might one day be forced to evacuate from your home, provisions for shelter are uppermost. If your household is already equipped with a full complemen t of camping gear or a truck camper, you will not need t o make many further preparations. If not, several kin ds of equipment must be obtained. The first item is a tent. There are many fine famil y- sized tents on the market, and one which suits your taste and budget should be easy to find in a local sporti ng goods or department store. (Sears' tents are partic ularly suitable, well-made, and are reasonably priced.) On e of the most interesting tents I have seen is made by t he Beckel Canvas Company (Box 20491, Portland, Oregon 97220). It is designed to accommodate a wood stove, a very unusual feature. (The stove is also supplied b y Beckel.) I suggest that you get a tent that is larg er than you think you will need because your whole family w ill have to stay in it, along with all your supplies an d salvaged belongings from your damaged home. Since tents always seem to be crowded even under normal circumstances, this is not the right place to econo mize. It is best to get a tent with an external framework of aluminum poles rather than the kind with the poles inside. Interior supports are a nuisance, and the o utside framework can be much steadier in a wind. The second category of necessary items is sleeping gear. If you are not familiar with sleeping on the ground, be warned that there is much more here than meets t he eye. If you are forced to camp out, possibly in the snow or rain, the proper sleeping bags and accessories w ill be essential to your comfort and health. Having spent a few cold, miserable, and completely sleepless nights be cause of poor sleeping gear (in the summer at that), I ca nnot emphasize this point too strongly. You will need a down-filled sleeping bag (two and one-half to three pounds) for each person, or the equivalent in heavi er synthetic fiber-fill. The new mountaineering bags stuffed with Dupont Hollowfill II or Celanese Fortr el Polarguard polyester fiber are especially good beca use they stay warm when wet—a big advantage over down. Get sleeping bags with drawstring hoods that close tightly around the sleeper's head rather than the \"slumber party\" type which cannot be closed at the top. \"Modified mummy bags\" are handy because they can also be unzipped and used as blankets. Remember tha t light summer bags will not keep you warm in the win ter, although numerous blankets, towels, or even carpeti ng can help bridge the gap. In any case, be sure to bu y a full-length Ensolite pad for each bag, as well as a n inexpensive Mylar emergency blanket. The pad makes sleeping more comfortable by preventing body warmth from soaking into the ground, and the Mylar \"space\" blanket will reflect radiated heat back to your bod y. Both can make the difference between comfort and ut ter misery. The third category of items for cold weather includes special outdoor clothing. The crisis simul ation field tests of expedient fallout shelters made it o bvious that most people do not have proper outdoor clothin g. We scuttle from heated homes to heated cars to heat ed offices on a routine basis and usually experience v ery little exposure to the elements. For extended outdo or living, however, each member of the family must be equipped with insulated boots, two layers of wool s ocks, full-length thermal underwear, woolen pants (two la y- ers, one over the other), several wool shirts to we ar as multiple layers of insulation, an insulated hat or parka hood, a muffler, and a good pair of insulated glove s or mittens. If this sounds extreme, I suggest that you try a simple experiment. Go out in your back yard some winter night about 2 AM. Sit down on a stool and do n't move for an hour. If you still feel warm after that length of time, your selection of clothing was equal to th e challenge. Before making the test, however, be sure that someone will come to look for you after an hour, in case you don't return. What about the opposite problem—not too little warmth, but too much? For people on the west coast who may have to flee a nuclear threat by evacuating to the inland deserts, the danger of unbearably high temperatures is very real. In this case, the shelte r requirement is a sunshade and a cool local environm ent. The shade could be provided by a tent or self-suppo rting awning (there are no trees to tie ropes to on the d esert). The cool environment can be produced by digging a narrow trench about three feet deep along an east-w est line. The cool soil at that depth will help keep yo ur body from overheating. Incidentally, don't forget that d eserts are only hot during summer days. At night and in th e winter, they are bitterly cold. A special kind of shelter problem is produced by flooding such as that which occurs periodically in parts of the Mississippi valley—spring run-off puts thous ands of acres under water every few years. In these area s, whole counties can become submerged under three or LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 76"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" A top-of-the-line floating shelter, this emergency life raft comes with a radar reflecting tent.

Even if the water doesn't get any hi gher, you will have a problem finding a place to sit down or go to sleep. For people who live in areas which flood, it would be a good idea to buy a surplus six-man military li fe raft. There are more expensive river rafts, but the surpl us kind will do if in good condition. The best rafts a re the kind that make up into a floating tent, but you can easily adapt a cheap surplus tent to your raft with a pair of scissors and a tube of silicone cement or \"shoe goo .\" The raft should be stored partially inflated to keep it from cracking along folds and to facilitate rapid inflat ion in an emergency. A good place to keep it is in the raf ters or on the wall of your garage. Obviously, it is better to store the raft in an elevated position rather than in the base- ment. When you wake up in the middle of the night w ith the water around your knees, getting the partially inflated raft out of your flooded basement will be very difficult. Such a raft will provide both shelter and transpor- tation until the flood subsides. If you decide to g et a raft, be sure to include a few useful accessories, such a s a large-volume air pump for inflation (and re-inflati on if your raft leaks air), a set of inflatable life vest s, and perhaps even a small electric outboard motor. If yo u keep the battery charged, an electric motor is much more dependable than a gasoline powered motor. (One can even be scavenged from your car.) Personal protective clothing and equipment has also been designed to safeguard individuals who for some reason are forced out in the open where they m ay be subjected to fallout, thermal flash, high ultrav iolet exposure, or noxious gases. Suppose a nuclear warhead detonates a few miles away and the thermal pulse starts a fire in the bus hes next to the side of your house. Knowing that the fa llout shouldn't begin to arrive for at least thirty minut es, you might rush outside to put out the fire before it sp read to the house. Suddenly a second warhead detonates over the same target, catching you in the searing therma l pulse. How could you protect yourself? For personal protection against the danger of flash burns, it is sufficient to place any opaque object between you and the fireball. In Hiroshima, people who were 77 HOME SWEET HOLE "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"very close to the epicenter received \"pattern burns \" where the thermal pulse burned exposed skin but was absorbed or reflected by their clothing. A light-co lored item of clothing was sufficient to reflect the heat , espe- cially if it was composed of heavy cloth or was sev eral layers thick. For a retreater forced by circumstances to be out- side in an area of thermal flash effects, the lesso n is clear. Light-colored clothing several layers thick is call ed for, as well as complete head and face protection. White wool is very resistant to ignition by flash effects , espe- cially if you take the precaution of dousing yourse lf with water before going outside. Head protection can be as simple as a hood of white cloth, held in place by a hat or headband. The best way to protect the face is to sh ape the hood to form a veil, exposing only the eyes. A wide-brimmed hat angled to shade your face from the nearest likely target will help too. Sunglasses sho uld be worn to cut down on the chance of temporary flash blindness, but do not expect them to shield your ey es from the thermal pulse—it is much too intense to be stopped by a pair of sunglasses. Whatever you do, d on't look over toward the potential target even for an i nstant. If one of the worst nightmares of nuclear war should come true, we may have to endure several yea rs of exposure to abnormally high levels of ultraviole t light, caused by thermonuclear side-effects which d e- stroy atmospheric ozone. This exposure to ultraviol et light can be extremely serious from the standpoint of sunburn and snowblindness. Calculations have shown that it might be possible for a Caucasian to receiv e a second degree burn after a few minutes of exposure to sunlight under these conditions, and some form of p ro- tection is necessary for anyone who has to venture out- side even for brief periods. Fortunately, sunburn is a common malady, and snowblindness is not unfamiliar. Just as in the cas e of flashburns, the secret is to cover up. The Arab-lik e protective clothing, hood, wide-brimmed hat, and su n- glasses will go a long way toward removing the risk from a high ultraviolet environment. Don't forget to sto ck up on sunscreen ointments, zinc oxide, and sunburn rem e- dies when you are putting together your survival stockpile. Remember also that the ultraviolet light is asso- ciated with sunlight and presents no obstacle to go ing outside at night. This is the time when you will be able to spend hours in the garden or take care of your farm . If the ultraviolet menace materializes, we may all sim ply become nocturnal for a few years, shifting the busi ness day to the hours of darkness and sleeping when the sun is up. If there is any chance that you will have to go outside while the fallout is still active in your a rea (for instance, to tend livestock or to decontaminate the paved areas around your house) you will need anti-c on- tamination clothing. The main purpose of such cloth - ing is to protect your skin from beta radiation bur ns which occur when fallout particles come into contac t with your skin. Beta radiation is very limited in p enetra- FIGURE 31: Anti-contamination Protective Clothing. Pictured in an official Soviet civil defense text. (P. T. Yergorov , I. A. Shlyakhov and N. I.

The burns the m- selves are not serious and heal after a few weeks w ithout appreciable scarring, but they could easily become infected in the meantime. Once again the secret is to cover up (see figure 31 ). This time the color of the clothing doesn't matter as much as the material used. You will need a suit of dustproof material such as rubberized cloth or plas tic. A suit of inexpensive plastic rain gear will satisfy the requirement, provided that the coat has a fairly la rge hood. Plastic garbage bags will provide material wi th which to improvise coverings for your feet, and a r oll of sticky silver \"duct\" tape will help you seal up you r en- semble. Don't forget to wear rubber gloves and tape the coat sleeves tightly around the gloves at the wrist s. As for your head, bear in mind that one of the wors t places to get fallout is inside your lungs. The bes t ar- rangement is to wear a gas/ dust mask on your face with the hood of the coat pulled out on to the surface o f the mask and taped in place. The whole-face MK-5 gas mask supplied to the Navy is one of the best for th is purpose and can be used to protect you from a wide range of noxious gases as well. (These are availabl e from the Ruvel Company, 3037 North Clark Street, Chicago , Illinois 60657, for about 15 dollars.) If you don't have a gas/dust mask, improvise a filter with a terrycloth wash- cloth and tie it to your face like a surgeon's mask . You may find that you will grow too hot inside your sealed anti-contamination suit, especially during h ard physical labor. You can cool off a little by wearin g a water-soaked shirt over the plastic suit. As the wa ter evaporates, it will help cool your body. Even so, y ou might have to stop work after an hour or so to avoi d overheating. Commentary Shelter is a very broad term, covering protection from normal weather as well as special conditions brought about by natural catastrophes and nuclear w ar. Even so, by carefully deciding what kinds of shelte r you may require, you can protect yourself with a minimu m of inconvenience and expense. At the very least, a retreater should have a clear idea of how to build an expedient fallout shelter in an emer- gency. I would suggest that your family take steps to acquire a significant degree of fallout protection and a complete set of outdoor equipment and camping gear. The expense can be managed with a little care, and the security of being prepared is priceless. That's my kind of bargain. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 80"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"5 A Loaf of Bread, a Jug of Wine, and Chow SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS THE BASIC THEME which ties together all of the various political, moral, and religious factions of the survivalist movement. Lef t- wing \"hippies,\" right-wing \"patriots,\" back-to-the- landers, and religious and economic survivalists al l puzzle over the same questions. How much food to store? How to store it? How much water? How to puri fy it? What about power? How much fuel? How much land? What crops to plant? The list is endless. This chapter and the next (which is devoted to do-it-yourself medicine) present an overview of thi s very broad subject. There is so much popular literature on self-sufficiency that it is impossible to do more t han briefly review the field. Even so, I hope to accomp lish three things in this chapter. First, I think it is important to provide a general treatment of survival self- sufficiency for readers who are just starting to ex plore the subject. Second, more experienced readers may b e interested in a critique of some common survivalist attitudes regarding stored food, hunting, and other sub- jects. Finally, vital survival tips relating to the ecological consequences of nuclear war will be discussed. In any case, there is a lot of ground to cover. Stored Food Stockpiles Survival self-sufficiency depends largely upon stored emergency food. Since the Mormon church adopted its emergency food storage program a few ye ars ago, the proliferation of food storage plans, produ cts, and technology has been explosive. I feel that an o verall picture of this trend will be more helpful to most people than itemized instructions which don't quite apply to anyone's particular situation. (That way you can pi ck out the approach that best fits your philosophy—and pocketbook—and pursue it as you see fit.) The subject of emergency food storage is tied inex- tricably with nutritional considerations, shelf lif e, food faddism, and blatant sales promotion. It can be ver y difficult to separate one influence from another. F or example, what exactly is meant when a prominent authority advises you that a food item is \"no good? \" It might mean that the nutritional content deteriorate s to an unacceptable level by the time the product is to be used. The vitamins disappear. Usually, though, vita min deterioration takes place soon after the package is sealed, and the rate of deterioration slows down af ter a few weeks have passed. To allege that the nutrition al content of a stored food item is adequate until the fourth or fifth year (when it suddenly drops like a stone) is difficult to justify. That allegation, however, is very common. Maybe the expert meant that the food becomes in- edible or unwholesome after a certain period of tim e. Could be. Some foods slowly undergo chemical deteri o- ration and finally become inedible even in the abse nce of microorganisms. The published figures forshelf live s are quite varied, however. Some manuals list powdered milk as an item that is inedible after six months. Others describe twenty-year-old powdered milk that is stil l as edible as the day it was packaged. The truth of the matter is that we haven't been storing food items l ong enough (or carefully enough) to know exactly what t heir shelf lives are. My personal suspicion is that when a survival nutri - tion expert says your stockpile of food is \"no good \" after a certain period of time, that person's primary mot ive is to get you to discard it and buy more. I know this sounds cynical, but the only practical approach to the she lf life question is to routinely sample items from your sto ck- pile to see what condition they are in. Your own ex pe- rience is your only safe guide. No one else is stor ing your food under the conditions found in your house. Let's begin our tour of emergency food programs by examining regular supermarket foods which come i n 81 A LOAF OF BREAD, A JUG OF WINE, AND CHOW"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"TABLE 7 Suggestions for Shelter Basic Food Supply SOURCE: Personal and Family Survival, Office of Civ il Defense, 1966—D119.8/8.3 11-A LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 82"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"cans, jars, boxes, and plastic wrappers. Some peopl e stock up on frozen or refrigerated items. I have ne ver been able to see the wisdom of this, unless you hav e an iron-clad guarantee of refrigeration even in a majo r crisis. Therefore, this discussion will be restrict ed to items which are normally stored at room temperature . Can you construct an emergency food stockpile from supermarket foods? Of course you can—within reason. Food storage experts usually frown on canne d goods because of their supposedly short shelf lives . The foods we find in the market are not intended to rem ain palatable for more than a year. Industry efforts ha ve concentrated on achieving that one year span, as th at is sufficient time to grow (and can) an entirely new c rop. How much longer the food may last is usually not known. Since the foods will last for at least one year, it is obvious that a carefully managed stockpile containi ng a year's supply of canned food can be organized. It i s only necessary to acquire the stockpile gradually and th en use up and replace year-old items as necessary. This re quires a lot of organization, however, and most people don 't want to bother with the involved record keeping and constant attention this system requires. Therefore, the canned-food approach to stockpiling is usually rese rved for people whose interest is in a short-term stockp ile. (By short-term I refer to a food supply sufficient for one week to one month.) In any case, it is relatively s imple to do your grocery shopping on the basis of \"one can f or me and one for a friend\" until you have built up yo ur supply. As an example of this kind of plan, see table 7, a suggested list of civil defense foods, originally p rovided by the Office of Civil Defense. This stockpile is d esigned for a two-week shelter stay when there will be no o ppor- tunity for cooking. (That's a point to consider car efully.) The \"maximum shelf life\" column in this table is in ter- esting for several reasons. For one thing, the stat ed shelf lives greatly exceed those quoted by people who sel l freeze dried food. The eighteen-month life of candy must refer to chocolate bars, because hard candy is nearly indestructible. The expiration date for suga r is also hard to understand, since sugar can't rot and doesn't contain any vitamins. There are no figures for nonfat dry milk, cheese, or peanut butter because t heir shelf lives depend on many uncontrolled factors. Tomato products are excluded because they are acidi c and tend to corrode the cans they are stored in. For large-scale food preparedness, a program of supermarket-type foods is obviously inadequate. Wha t about the Mormon \"basic four\" food storage pro- gram, involving bulk containers of wheat, sugar (ho ney), powdered milk, and salt? This approach to food stoc k- piling is really as old as agriculture. It is simpl e and cheap, and three of the components have the virtue of nearly unlimited shelf life. The usual program cons ists of storing wheat in large plastic trash barrels or sealed cans in which carbon dioxide or nitrogen has been u sed to drive out the oxygen (an anti-insect precaution) . Powdered milk is somewhat more difficult to store, but it can be continually recycled or purchased in spec ial nitrogen-packed cans for long storage. The salt and sugar are packaged to keep out moisture and, barrin g accidents, will keep forever. A year's supply of th ese staples for one adult costs less than 300 dollars. There are some drawbacks to be expected in the face of such economy. The \"basic four\" diet is aust ere, and to most people it is disturbingly unfamiliar. A fre- quently heard warning is that old people and childr en may refuse to eat these foods in a stressful situat ion and will starve to death instead. It would be best to t ry the program out for a week or two before limiting your options to this plan. The allegation that the basic four program is borin g (wheat—wheat—wheat) has some basis, but don't assume that bread is all you would be able to make from these staples. There are an amazing variety of ways to prepare whole wheat products. As a single example, consider gluten, the protein fraction of flour, whi ch is easy to extract and can be made into a meat substit ute that is difficult to tell from the real thing. I ha ve pre- pared chicken-fried gluten steaks which my \"tasters \" mistook for breaded veal. They had never heard of gluten and thought I was referring to the breading on the outside of the \"meat.\" There can be variety in this diet. The published authorities disagree in their recom- mendations of how much of each staple to store. I reviewed the recommendations of seven \"experts\"; th e results are shown in table 8. In the column indicat ing range, the lower figures are based on the assumptio n that you will store other kinds of food as well as the basic four. The higher figures follow the assumption that the basic four represent almost everything you will eat .

My evaluation of the basic four approach is that it is the cheapest and most trouble-free way to compil e a large supply of food. There are definite drawbacks in the amount of skill and the amount of energy (in terms of heat) needed for preparation, however. The nutritio nal quality of the diet is disputed and may be seriousl y deficient in certain amino acids. For a nuclear war situa- 83 A LOAF OF BREAD, A JUG OF WINE, AND CHOW"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"tion, though, nothing else will do as well. Because of their low cost and long life, I suggest that a nucl ear war survivalist store a five-year supply of these foods . When you are preparing for severe climatic disruption an d several years of ultraviolet-seared crops, you will need the largest reserve of staples you can handle. A st ock of wheat, milk, sugar, and salt is the easiest way to stretch your money into supply. The third major approach to emergency food involves stockpiling large amounts of commercially packed air dried or freeze dried foods. There is a great deal of sales pressure behind these products, a fac tor to keep strongly in mind when reading about them or talking to sales representatives. I think it is saf e to say that these foods offer variety, taste, and familiar ity (in most cases), as well as relatively long storage lif e. Unfor- tunately, they are very expensive. A year's supply of meats, vegetables, fruits, stews, and various other prod- ucts for one person can cost more than 1,500 dollar s. The manufacturers say (correctly) that this is less than you would normally pay for food in a year, but you could buy five years' worth of the \"basic four\" for the same price. This is the trade-off. The freeze dried prod- ucts are good, tasty, and easy to prepare, but they cost more than many people are willing to pay. Hand-in-hand with the dried food companies are the companies that specialize in selling\"nutritiona l sup- plements.\" These are special packages containing hi gh- potency vitamin and mineral capsules, and usually a form of soybean protein for making \"fortified\" drin ks. My feelings about these supplements are mixed. The protein supplements are a good idea, but if you are a self-reliant kind of person (i.e., a survivalist) y ou can buy the soy protein in bulk at a health food store and package it yourself for 10 to 20 percent of the com mer- cial price. (That's five to ten times more protein for the same money.) The vitamins are essential, but again, you can get more for your money at a discount drug stor e. My overall recommendation to someone who wants to start a food stockpile would be the follow ing: 1. Increase your normal home supply of canned goods to include a two-week to one-month surplus. Recycle it periodically. This will give you a supply of you r everyday foods which will not require special skill s to prepare, will not require added water, and will not require cooking. This is your first line of defense . 2. Get a six-month supply of commercially packaged freeze dried (or air dried) foods. Make your own selection to suit your tastes. Be sure to remember that this is your best form of stored meat; buy accordin gly. 3. Use the \"basic four\" to fill in the gaps. A six- month supply of wheat, sugar, salt, and powdered milk add ed to the freeze dried meals will be a reasonable com- promise between variety and expense. It is best to buy milk in nitrogen packed cans from a survival food supplier. It will last longer that way. Nuclear war survivalists should seriously consider storing up t o five years' worth of the \"basic four\" to see them through in case of repeated crop failures due to cl i- mate and ultraviolet levels. 4. Arrange for vitamin/mineral and protein supple- ments, either from commercial suppliers or from you r own manufacture. A modest investment here will free you from worries about nutritional inadequacies in the stockpile. Water Storage and Purification When the discussion turns to water, there are only two alternatives. You can store a very limited supp ly of it, or you can obtain it from outside. The assumpti on, of course, is that you will not be able to get safe dr inking water out of the tap. An earthquake, a labor disput e, a nuclear strike, or a terrorist attack could easily cut off your municipal water supply and leave you on your own. It is easy enough to set aside an emergency supply of water in jars, bleach bottles, or five-gallon ca ns, but it is very hard to store enough to supply a family for more than a few weeks. The inescapable problem with wate r is that a cubic foot of it weighs over 60 pounds and c annot be concentrated into a smaller volume. Four hundred cubic feet of water contains 3,000 gallons and repr esents a scant supply of drinking water for a family of fo ur to stretch over a year. That quantity weighs about ten tons and requires a tank the size of an average bedroom. But you can buy (and bury) such a tank if you are serio us about storing water. On a smaller scale, it is possible to buy commer- cially canned water at outrageous prices, or you ma y can it yourself using canning jars and a water bath can ner. I have had excellent results storing water in one-gal lon plastic milk bottles which have been thoroughly was hed with soap and water, then soaked in a hot, bleach s olu- tion for several days. Some people add a few drops of tincture of iodine or household bleach to the store d water to prevent microorganisms from growing in the bottles, but this isn't usually necessary. Most cit y tap water is so full of chemicals already that nothing can possibly grow in it—it even kills yeast in bread do ugh. Rationing of stored water is discussed further in chapter 8, but it is important to mention here that the amount to store for each person ranges between one quart and two gallons per day. One quart is the bar e minimum for maintaining life under optimum condi- tions (no activity, high carbohydrate diet, and coo l temperatures). Two gallons provide water for drinki ng, cooking, and limited bathing. The more the better. If you get your water from a stream or river, or from a questionable municipal water supply, you wil l LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 84"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" The Waterpik Portable Instapure water purifier kill s microorganisms and removes objection- able particles and odors from drinking water. (Avai lable from Holubar Mountaineering Ltd., Box 7, Boulder, Colorado 80306.) have to purify it. Purification involves the remova l of objectionable tastes, harmful microorganisms, fallo ut grains, and dissolved radioactive chemicals from th e water. The process sounds complex, but actually it isn't. There are several portable water purification kits on the market which use silver, iodine, or chlorine to kill bacteria while filtering the water through activate d char- coal and spun glass to remove particulates and diss olved chemicals. The units are small (about the size of a can of tennis balls) and very easy to use. I recommend the Waterpik Portable Instapure Model PI-1 for nuclear war applications because it uses iodine as the anti bacte- rial agent. The iodine is in the form of small tabl ets marketed as \"Potable Aqua\" by the Wisconsin Pharma- ceutical company. The tablets cost about 3 dollars for enough to treat fifty pints, but if you visit your local surplus store, you can get the same thing in a GI b ottle for about 70 cents. The tablets start out gray but turn rust color after a few years when they lose their p otency. Be sure to check the color of the surplus tablets. The normal procedure with the Portable Instapure is to drop an iodine tablet into a pint of water, l et it sit for a while to kill the germs, and then run the water t hrough the activated charcoal filter. This removes all par ticu- lates and bad tastes—including that of the disinfec ting iodine. The end result is sweet, pure water. This i s not the way to use the kit in a nuclear war setting, ho wever. If the water has been contaminated with fallout, yo u must run it through the filter first, and then add the iodine tablet. Drink the water with the iodine stil l in it. It tastes bad, but it isn't a health risk unless you h ave thyroid problems. Consult your doctor to determine whether this will be a hazard to you. The point of the purification is to diminish the effect of iodine-131 on your body. This radioactive chemical is present in fallout and dissolves in wat er. If you drink contaminated water, the iodine-131 winds up in your thyroid gland, where it can do a surprising ly great amount of damage. 1 The activated charcoal filter removes most of the dissolved iodine-131 from the water. When you drink the purified water, you flood your thyroid with harmless iodine and block the abs orp- tion of the remaining radioactive iodine. This prec au- tion is vital in fallout areas for the first two or three weeks following the attack. Iodine-131 has a very s hort life and is most dangerous during this time. If you're not concerned with fallout problems, it isn't necessary to use iodine for your water purify ing agent. Other chemical agents, or just boiling, will do very well. If you have purchased retreat property out in the woods, you will want a well, or maybe even two well s. A good deep well is the only absolutely dependable so urce of untreated water, especially in the case of nucle ar attack. Just be sure that you can pump it by hand i f you have to. Those electric pumps won't work when the power fails. For a retreater on a sailboat or life raft, drinkin g water may be the biggest single survival problem. A t sea you have fish, shellfish, and so forth for food, bu t there is no drinkable water.

These are, more or less, big bea ch balls which use sunlight to d isti l l drinking water from s ea- water. Each still produces about a pint of water a day, which means that nine stills per person will be nec essary.

Those of you to whom the \"basic four\" food stock- pile is appealing will want to see Passport to Surv ivalby Esther Dickey. 1 This is one of the earliest books in the field and unquestionably one of the best. In a sing le sentence, Passport to Survival is a cookbook writte n for the survivor of a major disaster who has had the fo re- sight to store a lot of wheat. Dickey makes a basem ent full of grain sound like a gourmet supermarket. Running a close second to the above is Lorraine Tyler's The Magic of Wheat Cookery. 4 This is not a survivalist publication, but it does introduce meth ods of wheat cooking using flour you grind yourself. This book is specifically oriented toward the Bosch Magic Mil l and Magic Mixer, both of which are excellent products. A book which provides a broader discussion of home food storage is Family Storage Plan by Bob Zabriskie. 5 Zabriskie presents a detailed emergency food storage plan and does it with commendable brev - ity. He covers canned goods as well as basic staple s and provides inventory forms for stockpile management. For people interested in a comprehensive program involving bulk staples, freeze dried food, and nutr itional supplements, the classic survivalist text is Howard Ruffs Famine and Survival in America.'' Ruff is one of the outstanding figures in survivalism, with a popu lar newsletter (The Ruff Times) and a television series to his credit. He is also a salesman, a fact which leaps o ut of every page of his book. There is no more detailed c onsid- eration of survival nutrition at present than that in Ruffs book. In my opinion, the best information on state-of- the-art food stockpiling can be found in Bill Pier' s arti- cles in the Personal Survival Letter, which Pier co -edits with Mel Tappan. 7 His articles are forthright, sensible, a pleasure to read, and worth the 125 dollars per y ear subscription fee for the newsletter.

Growing Your Own Food One popular approach to retreating has been to buy LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 86"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"rural property or a small farm and to plan on raisi ng food in the event of an emergency. This branch of s urvi- valism is almost indistinguishable from the back-to -the- land movement, in which the object is to be self-sufficient even if there is no emergency. Surv ivalists can make use of the experiences of the back-to-the- land people in planning self-sufficient farms and homest eads. Keep in mind, however, that the anti-technology att i- tude of many neo-homesteaders can also be anti- survival when things get tough. The first consideration, choosing the property for your retreat, is a subject fraught with legal probl ems, financial hurdles, and agricultural questions. It i s com- monly said that in order to be self-sufficient, abo ut two acres of land per person are needed. You can get by on less, but only if everything else is going your way in terms of climate, growing season, fertilizer, and i nsecti- cides. The two acres must be land that can be farme d, not woodlot, mountain, or rocky ground. One of the most common mistakes which starry-eyed neophytes make is to buy \"farm\" land that can't be farmed. I visited one idealistic commune which consisted of fifty acr es perched on the spur of a mountain. The land was on a 30 to 50 degree slope, and the nearest available water was 1,000 feet below in the valley. The inhabitants car ried water up the hill in a truck to keep their tiny veg etable patch going. That's okay if you can afford it (they had jobs in town), but it isn't self-sufficiency. For finding and selecting land, there are two sour- ces of information which I regard as indispensable. The first is Finding and Buying Your Place in the Count ry by Les Scher. 8 Scher describes himself as an \"attorney-at- law and consumer advocate\" and covers every angle o f this subject in slightly under 400 pages. Scher poi nts out in detail the many potential pitfalls in buying rur al land. Getting swindled by a sharp real estate salesman co uld ruin your survival plans permanently, so it pays to be very careful. The second resource is Jim McKeever's Investment and Survival Letter, generally referred to as McKee ver's MISL. 9 I was fortunate to be able to visit Jim at his ranc h in Oregon, and I came away convinced that he is the man to talk to about planning a small survivalist homes tead. He is actually on the land learning to grow crops a nd to milk goats, and he has many valuable observations about survivalist farming. The last I heard, the su bscrip- tion rate was 95 dollars for twenty issues per year . It's worth it if you are planning on a farm for survival . Once you have your land, you will need some guid- ance about how to use it. Running a small farm or r anch is a full-time profession, not a task you can light ly assume. There are hundreds of books available on ho w to run a homestead; you will need several dozen of them if you aren't lucky enough to have a friend who can teach you the ropes. Unfortunately, it seems that people who farm well frequently don't write well. (The opposit e may also be true.) A few homesteading guides are excell ent, however. One resource I wouldn't be caught without is John Seymour's THE Guide to Self-sufficiency. 10 This man- ual must be seen to be believed. The illustrations are shaded drawings as precise and detailed as photogra phs. They are generously used to provide step-by-step instructions for every imaginable homestead procedu re from butchering hogs to building barrels. It is rel atively thin (250 large-format pages) but is so packed with information that I wouldn't trade it for a shelf of other homesteading books. A second manual is Grow It! by Richard Langer. 11 Langer does with words what Seymour does with pic- tures. H is analysis of managing a small farm is ve ry good and is heavily loaded with practical pointers. This is more of a textbook than a reference manual, intende d to teach the reader all about farming. Third is a unique manual for rural living. I refer to Carla Emery's Old Fashioned Recipe Book. 12 I was fortunate to acquire my copy during the period when Carla was still printing it herself, mimeographing it at home on colored paper. This \"recipe book\" was writt en with the wisdom of the old Chinese proverb that beg ins \"For rabbit stew: First catch a rabbit...\" My copy has over 600 pages of closely typed instructions, recip es, anecdotes, observations, and suggestions. I can't imagine learning to be self-sufficient without cons ulting this manual. Gardens and Gardening Nuclear war presents special problems for the would-be survivalist gardener. Not the least of the se problems is the fact that seeds must be stored unti l planting is possible. An interesting solution is th e \"Sur- vival Garden,\" a vacuum-packed assortment of seeds packaged by the Clyde Robin Seed Company and mar- keted through Survival, Inc. The Survival Garden co n- tains a selection of green beans, beets, cabbage, c arrots, corn, onions, peas, spinach, summer squash, and tomatoes. I bought a can of these seeds with the intention of debunking them. The idea that perishable seeds coul d be canned for prolonged shelf life struck me as an imp ossi- bility, and that a single selection of seeds would be useful anywhere in the country seemed very improbable. I w as surprised on both counts. The varieties selected re pre- sent a nice blend of true-breeding characteristics and rapid development. (By \"true-breeding\" I mean that succeeding generations of seeds will produce the sa me quality of plant each year.) The spinach is an exce ption. It is a hybrid, and can be expected to deteriorate in quality and yield with each generation of inbreedin g. Hybrids are genetic manipulations, like mules, and do not reproduce well. 87 A LOAF OF BREAD, A JUG OF WINE, AND CHOW"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" The Survival Garden seed assortment, packaged by th e Clyde Robin Seed Company. (Available from Surviva l, Inc., 16809 S. Central Avenue, Carson, California 90746.) The rapid growth of the Survival Garden seeds is important for two reasons. First, the seeds can be used in almost any part of the country and will mature befo re the growing season is over. Even in the warmer part s of the country, it might be necessary to start your ga rden in midseason, in which case rapidly maturing plants ar e useful. Second, if a nuclear war produces a cooling of the climate (as discussed in chapter 2), short-seas on crops will be needed even in parts of the country w hich normally have long growing seasons. Frosts will be coming early for several years. The thing which surprised me the most about the Survival Garden is the quantity of seeds provided. The can of seeds costs under 10 dollars; you could spen d over ten times that much buying the same seeds in packet s at your local nursery. I thought that this was remarka bly generous until I realized the reason: Stored seeds lose their viability on a percentage basis. If a crop of seed is 98 percent viable when it is packaged, it might be only 50 percent viable the next year. In the third year it might be only 10 percent viable, and so on. The Survival Gar den contains half an ounce of carrot seeds, which is en ough to plant thousands of carrots, if all the seeds ger minate. If the seeds lose most of their viability, however, the large quantity insures that you will still be able to grow a respectable number of carrots. If the number of living seeds is very low, you can still use the few resulting carrot plants as a seed source for the fo llowing season. I think it's a good arrangement. How long will such a can of seeds last? Since the seeds are vacuum packed in a metal container, they are safe from insects and rodents. Spoilage should not be a problem. Corn and onion seeds tend to lose their vi tality within the first two years under normal circumstanc es, however, and I would be somewhat suspicious of the entire seed supply after it had become four or five years old. I suggest buying a supply of corn seeds every year to be sure of their viability. Obviously, I endorse the Survival Garden seed supply. Unfortunately, there is a very serious flaw in it from the standpoint of nuclear war. If the war affe cts the ozone layer and increases ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, as it almost certainly will, most of the Survival Garden plants won't be able to survive. Th ey'll die of sun scald very rapidly. The scientific infor mation on this phenomenon is not as detailed as we would l ike. For now, table 9 will serve as a general guide to t he ultraviolet sensitivity of crop plants.

Cline and F.B. Salisbury, \"Effects o f Ultraviolet Radiation on the Leaves of Higher Plants,\" Radiatio n Botany 6 (1966), pp. 151-163. From this table you can see that most of the seeds in the Survival Garden selection may be impossible to grow in a post-attack environment. Corn should do well, however, especially after the first year or t wo is past and ultraviolet levels are starting to drop back to nor- mal. I suggest that you supplement your emergency s eed stockpile with enlarged supplies of the \"resistant\" crops, just in case. Some plants, such as onions, cannot s urvive ultraviolet exposure and cannot be stored long enou gh to bypass the high-ultraviolet period following the war. We will be forced to grow them in protected greenho uses or they will become extinct. Fortunately, wood fram e, plastic-covered greenhouses are cheap and can be st ored as bundles of precut wood parts and compact rolls o f plastic. (Plastic coverings which will block out 80 per- cent or more of incoming ultraviolet are available. ) I think the expense and trouble to preserve these spe cies are worth it. Hydroponics, the science of growing plants in arti- ficial nutrient solutions instead of soil, is also a viable alternative to traditional gardening. Hobbyist hydr o- ponic tanks can be readily adapted to automatic car e of greenhouse plants. This is definitely the way to de rive the maximum production from minimum space in a greenhouse. I suggest consulting Home Hydroponics and How to Do It by Lem Jones, or see Jim McKeever' s \"Your Own Food Factory\" in MISL number 151. 13 For a good general introduction to greenhouse manage- ment, try Organic Gardening under Glass by George and Katy Abraham. 14 Preserving Food If you plan on producing your own food, the sub- ject of home food preservation will become importan t to you sooner or later.

You have to preserve the food you grow or you'll wind up being fat in the fall and th in in the spring. There are many possible ways to approach food preservation. You can take your pick of canning, dr ying, smoking, pickling, jellying, freezing, salting, fer ment- ing, bulk storage, or storage in a root cellar. The main investment involves the purchase of lots and lots o f jars and a generous supply of canning lids. I favor wate r bath and pressure canning for most applications, since y ou can preserve nearly anything, including whole chick ens, without the blessings of refrigeration. It's simple and quite safe—if you follow the directions to the lett er. There are many good books on the topic. A novice should start with the Ball Blue Book, the manual pu b- lished by the company that makes Ball canningjars. It is usually available in supermarkets and is kept const antly up-to-date. For more advanced home food preservation, see Stocking Up, edited by Carol Stoner, and Keeping th e Harvest, by Nancy Thurber and Gretchen Mead. 16 Both are excellent. If the prospect of facing an uncertain future with a limited supply of canning lids makes you uneasy, le t me call your attention to Morris Reusable Home Canning Seals and Lids, produced by National Manufacturing. These lids are plastic and may not keep out externa l oxygen for as long as metal lids, but they are cert ainly good for a year, and you can use them over and over again. They are well worth trying out. A more expensive approach to resealing jars is provided by the Luminarc wide-mouth glass storageja r, manufactured by J.G. Durand International. These ar e heavy glass jars with hinged glass lids. They can b e used just like conventional canning jars, with a red rub ber \"o-ring\" providing the seal. With a little care, th e jars and rings can be reused time after time. Food Gathering Under the topic of \"gathering\" I have included foraging for wild edible plants, hunting, and fishi ng. As a botanist/ecologist/survivalist, I have been inter ested in wild edible plants for quite a while, and have m ore than once participated in a day of group foraging c li- maxed by a 100 percent natural dinner. As a hobby, collecting and eating natural foods is very enterta ining, but as a survival proposition, there are very few w ays for the average person to starve faster. Most of the wild plants regarded as \"edible\" are th e gustatory equivalent of lettuce. If you can find en ough to eat, get the snail tracks, spider eggs, and dirt washed off, swallow the greens without objecting to the un usu- ally strong or bitter taste, and avoid an allergic reaction, all you get in the end is a stomach full of water a nd indigestible roughage. Humans are not cows. Cellulo se does not break down in our digestive tracts. And if you are a normal person, you probably aren't too excite d about a dinner of unseasoned green leaves anyway.

Unless you can provide incredible qu anti- ties of fish (more than one pound of cooked meat pe r person each day), a diet of fish is a diet of slow starva- tion. Sometimes not so slow. As for hunting, it seems that just about everybody interested in retreating envisions himself as Danie l Boone. (\"If 1 get a mite hon-gry I'll jest take 01' Betsy and kill me a bar!\") Some people even take this sen se of identification so far as to buy a black powder Kent ucky rifle as their only survival hunting weapon. Others go a step further and purchase bows and arrows. They wil l be very hungry on the day after doomsday. Or dead—kill ed by a wounded \"bar.\" Although I have derided hunting, fishing, and gath- ering wild foods, wild edibles are still an importa nt resource which retreaters ought to learn how to exp loit. If you have just a marginal familiarity with the so urces of wild food in your area, you can stretch your eme r- gency food supply into a pleasing and well-balanced diet. With advanced hunting and gathering skills, y ou will have a very substantial buffer against starvat ion. How do you go about acquiring this degree of skill? Foraging for edible plants. Basically, there are three kinds of plants: edible plants, non-edible pl ants, and poisonous plants. In some cases there are edibl e, non-edible, and poisonous parts on the same plant. To be able to collect edible material only, you really must know what you are doing. Begin by learning to identify plants. To do this yo u will need a manual of the flora of your area. Don't waste your money on a simplified book of wildflower pictu res. The kind of book you need will be lengthy and might not have any pictures at all. You'll have to spend from 20 to 50 dollars for it. I won't recommend one here since these books are local in geographic coverage. Call your l ocal university botany department and ask the taxonomist to suggest one for your location. Be sure that your in terest isn't underestimated. Once you have the manual, you will need someone to teach you to use it. You might enroll in a botan y class, but be sure that the class deals strictly with \"loc al flora.\" There are few things in life as useless as a genera l botany course. If you can't enroll in an appropriate cours e, you may have to find a tutor. At first, you will defini tely need the assistance of someone who has experience in ide nti- fying plants. The reason you will need help is the almost univer- sal failing of floral manuals. The joke among botan ists is that the manuals are written by people who don't ne ed them for people who can't use them. It's true. The prob- lem is complicated by the fact that many \"species\" of plants pay no attention to the manuals and interbre ed so freely that it is impossible to identify them. In a n area containing several species of oaks, for instance, a lmost every individual is a mixture. If you don't have th e advice of someone who has been there before, that c ould be baffling. It's even a good idea to make up a col lection of properly identified specimens to keep as referen ces. Any botanist can tell you how. After you have learned to identify the most com- mon plants in your area, you can move on to the \"ed ible\" ones. There are many books on collecting \"natural\" foods, but I warn you that most of them are worthle ss. Some are even dangerous. One reliable resource, how - ever, is Edible Native Plants of the Rocky Mountain s by H. D. Harrington. 17 It is a useful guide; once you have seen it, you will know what the others lack. Many o f the plants covered in this book are common throughout t he country. If you own retreat property, you should consider managing the native vegetation in favor of edible s pe- cies. Without too much effort, you can dig up edibl e plants and replant them on your property. Plants pr es- ent on your land which are not edible can be thinne d or removed to make way for the newcomers. Hunting and fishing. Most people are more confi- dent about their ability to recognize edible animal s than edible plants. After all, if it walks, flies, swims , or slith- ers, there is a very good chance it can be eaten. A ll you have to do is kill it and cook it, right? Yes, but there are several catches. The biggest one is the part that b egins \"All you have to do ... \" Any study of survival hunting should begin with Mel Tappan's Survival Guns. 18 Most survivalists are familiar with this book, but for the uninitiated, S urvival Guns is a 450-page text on firearms for pest elimin ation, hunting, and defense under conditions of long-term sur- vival. No survivalist can be well-informed without this book. (My dog-eared copy wore out and I had to buy a new one.) I recently spent an afternoon in conversation with a friend who is a game manager on a large Indian rese rva- tion. We discussed survival hunting under post-atta ck conditions and came to some startling conclusions. Sport hunters will have some drastic changes to mak e in their expectations, equipment, and methods before they are ready to live off the land following a nuc lear war. For one thing, most hunters are \"sportsmen.\" Mod- ern hunting laws are designed to give animals a fai r break and usually stipulate that you can't shoot an y- thing between sunset and sunrise; use lights to fin d game at night; employ walkie-talkies or motor vehicles; use bait; shoot at sitting game birds; shoot at songbir ds; use unattended baited lines, nets, or traps for fish; s et snares; shoot females; or have more than five cartridges in your rifle at one time. By turning these rules around, t he advantage is given back to the hunter—a virtual che ck- 91 A LOAF OF BREAD, A JUG OF WINE, AND CHOW"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"list of survival hunting techniques is obtained. In short, hunters must unlearn the rules of conduct which the y are currently expected to follow. Consider big game hunting. Shooting a large animal for food is an attractive idea because one b ullet brings down so much meat, and the target itself is large and fairly easy to hit—if you have your wits togeth er. But in the aftermath of a nuclear war, big game hun ting is not likely to be a very productive pastime. Ther e are many reasons for this. First, if your area receives lethal doses of fallout, there just won't be any big game. Deer are just as sensitive to radiation as people. Secon d, the high level of ultraviolet light will force deer and other animals into exclusively nocturnal habits, and for a while at least it may force you into nocturnal habi ts, too. If you live in an area with winter snows, the ultra violet light will blind animals and indirectly result in v ery high mortality during the first winter. You may be able to take large numbers of animals while they are blinde d, but what about later? Add to this the fact that most game animals have yearly migrations which will leave you without anyt hing to hunt during half the year, even in \"good\" game a reas. In the summer the animals seek the security of the peaks while in the winter they migrate to the milder lowl ands. If your retreat is high in the mountains, you will have some long, meatless winters. If you have homesteade d in the valley, your summers will be mainly vegetarian. A fancy hunting rifle is clearly not a meal ticket. In addition, sport hunting rifles will be virtually useless for survival hunting in a nuclear war conte xt. Assuming that there are deer or other animals in yo ur area at all, they will be staying in very dense cov er by day and moving only at night. You and the animals will both be trying to avoid ultraviolet burns, and the deer will be trying to avoid you and all those other starving hu nters in the neighborhood. You will never get a 400-yard shot, not in the brush during the day and certainly not w hile you are hunting at night. Super-accuracy will not b e required. Instead, you will need a 12-gauge shotgun loaded with buckshot or a rifle capable of firing rapidly and repeatedly. Clamping a powerful flashlight on the barrel of the gun will help you locate and hit game in the dark. (A deer's eyes shine in the beam of light as much as 1 00 yards away.) If you adjust the beam to coincide wit h the shot pattern or bullet trajectory, you can even use it as an aiming device. Another variation of this trick i s to use a red filter on the flashlight. Many large mammals are blind to monochromatic red light. You can see them clearly, but they think they are safely hidden in t he darkness. For a nuclear war situation, I suggest hunting with a military assault rifle. For one thing, with such a rifle you can keep shooting as long as a target is visibl e (or audible, dangerous as that is). Bolt actions are to o slow on successive shots for survival hunting. Then ther e is the problem of other hunters. As soon as you pull t he trigger, everybody within five miles will know two important things about you. First, they will have a t least a general notion of where you are. Second, they wil l know that you have seen something worth shooting. They will be hungry too, and may decide that their best chance of bringing home the venison will be to loca te you. History has shown that about 1 person in 10 will rob for food if starving; about 1 in 100 will commi t murder for food; roughly 1 in 1,000 will eat human flesh if hungry enough; and 1 in 10,000 will actively hun t peo- ple. Are you sure you want to be out in the woods hunting with a bolt-action rifle? Not me. What about small game? In Survival Guns, Tap- pan makes a pretty convincing case for doing small game hunting with air guns, and I totally agree wit h his reasons. Adult pellet rifles are available which ha ve sufficient accuracy and power to kill small animals at ranges as great as thirty to fifty yards. Furthermo re, these rifles are quiet enough to avoid spooking the game if you miss, and they do not advertise the fact tha t you are out hunting. They need very little maintenance, and pellets can be obtained by the thousands for just a few dollars. Silence, accuracy, and reliability make ai r guns very attractive to survivalists. I asked Robert Beeman, Ph.D., for his thoughts on air guns and survival applications, and, not surpri singly, he had kind words to say about the Beeman line of a ir rifle products. According to the expert, the most p opu- lar items he sells for survival hunting include the Bee- man/Feinwerkbau 124, the Beeman Model 35, and the Beeman/Weihrauch Model 35 rifles. 19 The rifles are usually fitted with a metal aperture sight or a sco pe, and perform best when used with Beeman/H&N or Silver Jet pellets. The inherent accuracy of these rifles ranges from 0.15 to 0.25 inches at 25 feet, with velocitie s between 700 and 800 feet per second. When hunting with an air rifle, be sure that you do not overlook the potential of songbirds as game. It is only recently that these birds have been legally pr o- tected; our heritage includes centuries of \"four an d twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.\" When you conside r that, as protected species, these birds do not fear humans, you begin to appreciate them as a fairly ea sy source of food. Once you shoot and clean the first bird of the day, you can set up the refuse as bait. Back of f a measured distance with your air rifle and wait. Som e- thing will come to investigate the offal. Score num ber two. Now you have twice as much bait—and so on. Or you might scatter a little corn or wheat around. Wh en you have attracted enough birds, you can \"ground sluice\" them—shoot the whole flock with one shotgun LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 92"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"shell. (You've heard of \"sitting ducks.\" You have t o admit it's economical.) The Federal Ammunition Guide (a brochure avail- able in sporting goods stores) lists number 6 shot for almost all kinds of small game. You may also want s hells loaded with buckshot and rifled slugs, depending on the big game in your area. Be wary of the buckshot load s, however. The 3 inch magnum loads contain marginally more pellets and kick a lot more than a 2% inch var iety, but few people realize that the smaller shells actu ally propel the pellets faster (which means greater pene tra- tion and range). Of course, the most efficient possible way to obtai n small game is to trap it. Trapping is very valuable to a survivalist, because the trap stays outside working twenty-four hours a day while the trapper hunts, gardens, sleeps, and generally ignores it. For surv ival- ists, the Havahart repeating bird and rodent traps are especially useful. 20 Havahart's sparrow and pigeon traps capture one bird after another, alive, without need ing any attention. They will hold up to ten pigeons or twenty smaller birds at one time. The rodent traps will ta ke up to fifteen mice or several rats without being reset ; this could be quite a blessing if your homestead develop s rodent problems. The same principle applies for fishing as for hunt- ing both big and small game. Leave your trusty fly rod at home. You can practice sport fishing if you want to , but filling the pot requires a different approach. If y ou look through a typical book on emergency survival, you w ill find examples of netting and trapping fish en masse which would be foolish for a survivalist to ignore. These techniques are widespread in survival literature an d need little coverage here. If I were to recommend a single book to get you on the right track for survival hunting and fishing, i t would be Modern Hunting with Indian Secrets, by Allan A. Macfarlan. 21 Macfarlan covers a very wide range of \"dirty hunting\" tricks which will help to break the habits of sportsmanship and bring in some food. For all types of survivalist tasks, a good utility knife is indispensable. I asked the people at the Atlanta Cutlery Company to suggest a good survival knife, and they generously sent me several to try out. Two were esp e- cially interesting. One was a Bowen \"survival\" mode l, which is a belt-buckle knife. The handle is in the shape of a large square buckle, and the blade slips into a s heath sewn into the belt itself. It is not only a very ni ce looking knife, but it comes with a very presentable belt. T he edge is serviceable, the blade strongly made. It has two draw- backs, however. The first is the ludicrous possibil ity that whenever you want to use the knife, you will have t o hold up your pants with the other hand. Second is t he equally ludicrous fact that legislators in several states have decided that this little knife is a \"concealed weap- on\" and have passed special bills to outlaw it. (My Three utility knives for survivalists: the Victorin ox Swiss Army \"Explorer,\" the Bowen belt-buckle knife, and the Panther lock-blade foldi ng hunter. Note the \"Flicker attached to the blade of the Panther. This inexpensive devic e allows one-handed opening of the knife and subsequently serves as a finger guard. (B owen, Panther, and Flicket courtesy of the Atlanta Cutlery Company, PO Box 839, Conyers, Geor gia 30207.) 93 A LOAF OF BREAD, A JUG OF WINE, AND CHOW "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"evaluation of this blade as a weapon is such that I 'd rather fight bare-handed, knowing that my pants wou ld stay up.) The second knife was a Panther, a lock-blade fold- ing hunting knife. This is a heavy-duty pocket knif e which I have used in all kinds of kitchen, garden, work- shop, hunting, and survival tasks with complete sat isfac- tion. It holds its edge very well. Although it has only a single blade, I find that I use it all the time. In cidentally, Atlanta Cutlery also sells a little device called a \"flicket,\" which clips on the Panther blade and allows you to open the knife instantly with only one hand. You'll appr eciate that someday when you are in a hurry and your other hand is occupied. I wouldn't be without it. Something else I wouldn't be without is my Victori- nox Swiss Army pocket knife (the Explorer model). This knife is a three-inch toolbox which includes a can opener, bottle opener, wire stripper, two standard screwdrivers, a Phillips screwdriver, a magnifying glass, scissors, two knife blades, an awl, a corkscrew, tw eezers, and a toothpick. This, too, I use every day for rou tine chores and unpredictable minor maintenance. One cau - tion: Be sure it's a Victorinox. There are many che ap imitations. Energy and Utilities Energy is a topic of utmost importance to survival- ists. What about light? Cooking? Electrical power? Heating? There are two approaches. First, you may stockpile fuel. It is easy to use commercially available unde r- ground storage tanks to house your emergency supply of gasoline, propane, or whatever you feel you need. D on't try to store such fuels in above-ground portable ta nks or cans. The object of survivalism is to increase your chan- ces in a crisis, not to make life dangerous during normal times. You can use your stored fuel to heat your ho me, to cook your meals, or to power an electrical gener ator. It would be best to make your house as thermally ef fi- cient as possible, even to the extent of adding add itional layers of insulation which would normally not be ec o- nomical. Try to see that the waste heat from the ge nera- tor and from cooking is used again to heat the hous e. The exhaust from the generator must be vented direc tly to the outside, of course, but it can be routed thr ough a heat exchanger first. The obvious problem with stored fuel is that it mus t inevitably run out. Fortunately, the proponents of \"soft technology\" have been at work for several years dev ising more and more efficient solar collectors, windmill generators, deep discharge storage batteries, and o ther devices for home energy production and storage. You can now provide most of your own heat, hot water, a nd electricity if you take advantage of this research. There is still some difficulty with providing heat for cooki ng, however. At present, the best source is heat from b urn- ing wood. As an alternative, you can use a solar ov en to cook your main meal—provided you are content to eat only at noon on sunny days. A very convenient way to provide a fallout shelter with emergency power is to set up a twelve-volt sys tem based on automobile batteries and accessories. This allows you to make use of equipment designed for mo tor homes, campers, and vans such as refrigerators, lig hts, fans (both for air circulation and for venting kitc hen steam outside), vacuum cleaners (for removing fallo ut from hair and clothing), air compressors, water pum ps, spotlights, clocks, winches, burglar alarms, AM-FM radios, CB radios, tape decks, PA systems, and coff ee cup warmers! All the comforts of home. 22 For a good general introduction to alternative energy systems, see Producing Your Own Power, edite d by Carol Stoner; continuously updated information i s provided in Alternative Sources of Energy Magazine. 23 Frequent articles of interest appear in Popular Sci ence and Popular Mechanics, too. The Small Town As Refuge Recently, more and more survivalist leaders have come to the conclusion that the easiest way to insu re the continuity of essential goods and services is to mo ve to a small rural community. 24 They say that an agricultural town which produces most of its own food (or could do so) has a good probability of avoiding starvation. It can devote attention to essential projects, such as com munity defense. It has a proper balance of skilled people and a full assortment of tools, equipment, and supplies. All things considered there is no possible way for an i ndivid- ual or family to duplicate the self-sufficiency of a town. These survival experts practice what they preach. Their addresses are places like Eureka and Yreka, C ali- fornia; Rogue River and Medford, Oregon; Spokane, Washington; and Kalispell and Stevensville, Montana . These communities aren't all small, but on the aver age they will have fewer difficulties in times of crisi s than places like Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago. If you decide to move to a small rural community, do it soon. You will want to be a well-established member when things get nasty. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 94"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Commentary The hardest part of being a writer is not finding enough to say, but knowing when to stop. The topic of self-sufficiency is so large that I could write sev eral chapters (or books) about it without feeling that I had covered the topic adequately. I will have to conten t myself for now by advising you to consult other resources. Survival, Inc., mentioned earlier in this chapter, publishes a catalog of note. Also, be sure to see t he catalogs offered by Garden Way Publishing and Moth- er's Bookshelf. 25 Neither should the concerned survival- ist overlook The Survivor's Primer and Updated Retrealer's Bibliography, by Don and Barbie Ste- phens. 26 Books listed in these sources will give you the broadest possible access to information on self- sufficiency short of joining a commune. Three survivalist newsletters, also already men- tioned, are indispensable: McKeever's MISL, Pier's and Tappan's Personal Survival Letter, and Ruffs Ruff Times. In addition, Kurt Saxon's The Survivor shoul d be mentioned. 27 Saxon splits his attention between exploring nineteenth-century technology from the su r- vivalist viewpoint and inventing novel ways to unde r- mine the Eureka, California city council. Some of t he articles in The Survivor are very useful; others ar e maca- bre, but are still very useful. The subscription ra te is low and the volume of information in each issue is larg e, but The Survivor isn't for everyone. Finally, if you are ready to progress from the plan - ning stage to action, be sure to write for the cata log of the Cumberland General Store and for the Countrysid e Catalog. 28 These firms carry a large selection of hand- powered cultivators, seeders, dough kneaders, bottl e cappers, grain mills, meat grinders, fruit presses, wash- ing machines, corn shellers, sausage stuffers, and nearly everything else. Remember that food and other necessities can only be compiled during pre-crisis times. Don't wait too long. Notes 1.

LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 96"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"6 Nobody Makes Housecalls Anymore IN THE SPACE of the last three months, I have been brought into contact with physicians and hospitals alto- gether too frequently. In that period of time, an e lderly relative became involved in a serious automobile ac ci- dent and subsequently suffered a stroke. A young woman who is a close friend of the family developed a brain aneurysm and had to have very dangerous surge ry to correct it. Another close friend developed a 104 - degree fever that ran on for days and turned into m enin- gitis. He was in the hospital under codeine sedatio n for a week before he began to improve. My family and I pa rti- cipated in a holiday get-together after which every body but me got sick (I don't like potato salad). Anothe r friend developed a cyst in his head the size of an egg and had to have it treated. Yet another friend had a mi scar- riage. Last but not least, I spent five days taking care of a fourteen-month-old infant while his parents were out of town. He had the flu the whole time. What would we do if we needed professional medi- cal help and couldn't get it? The retreaters I have met regard that possibility as the single most difficul t prob- lem they face. After all, growing crops is not all that complicated. Pulling a trigger to bring in meat or defend your life is pretty simple, too. But if someone get s a small cut, and it becomes infected, and ominous red strea ks start to spread—what do you do? If one of your sent ries accidentally shoots himself in the foot—what do you do? If several members of your group arrive at the retreat suffering from flashburns or blast injuries —what do you do? Without a team of physicians, a fully st ocked pharmacy, and a well-equipped hospital, these ques- tions and others like them present life threatening dilemmas. Obviously, the best answer to medical problems would be to have a physician join your group. This might not be as difficult as it sounds. A surprisin gly large number of retreat groups are composed partial ly or wholly of physicians (particularly the commercia l \"rent-a-shelter\" groups in California). I suspect t hat this is due to the fact that doctors are at home with em er- gency situations, death, and, particularly, prevent ive attitudes. Their profession makes them tend to thin k like retreaters; it is only a small step to full-sc ale emer- gency preparedness. If you can't interest a physician in your group, th ere are several other medical professionals who could b e of assistance. The Office of Civil Defense suggests th e fol- lowing \"doctor substitutes,\" in order of priority: den- tists, veterinarians, registered nurses, pharmacist s, licensed practical nurses, trained medical corpsmen , podiatrists, and students of these disciplines. And if your circle of friends does not include any veterinarians, podiatrists, or medical corpsmen? Do n't despair. If you have to supply your own medical aid there is still quite a lot that you can do for your self, even in severe emergencies. This chapter is a guide to t he books, equipment, and supplies you will need in ord er to act as your own doctor under emergency conditions. In Appendix E I have also provided a selection of tech nical information about nuclear war injuries. These addi- tional materials are included because it is unlikel y that whatever doctor you eventually contact will be fami liar with them. There are perhaps a dozen physicians in the country who have seen a case of radiation sickness. Your doctor isn't likely to be one of them. There are two other points to bring up here. Don't be complacent just because your brother-in-law the pediatrician has joined your retreat group. You wil l need to prepare for do-it-yourself medicine anyway. What will you do if he doesn't make it to the retre at site? What if he arrives but is so badly injured that he needs a doctor? Be prepared. Lastly, be aware that modern physicians are rela- tively inexperienced in medical techniques which li e outside of their fields of specialization, and may never have studied therapies which are more appropriate t o a retreat than a hospital. They know the best way to treat a particular problem using the most modern hospital 97 NOBODY MAKES HOUSECALLS ANYMORE"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"equipment and supplies, but the second-best way (us ing two spoons and a can opener) is something that they have never tried, seen, heard of, or thought about. You will have to provide the books, supplies, and equip ment to assist your doctor in the difficult transition f rom modern medicine to retreat medicine. Otherwise, the doctor may be unable to help you. WARNING! Self-medication under circumstances where a phy- sician's care is available is not only illegal, it is extremely dangerous. The author and the publish- ers of this book do not recommend or endorse self-medication or the practice of medicine with- out a license in any way, shape, or form. The responsibility for any such activity is borne entirely by the reader. Seek professional medical help if there is any possible way to obtain it. Basic Medical Self-help In the next section I'll discuss \"first aid\" for re treat- ers, but first I want to cover a new and unique res ource of medical self-help which is gaining popularity ar ound the country. Public health authorities have begun t o implement self-help training courses for the genera l public which go far beyond the traditional Red Cros s \"first aid\" curriculum. These classes are intended to help a layman make the right decision about whether or n ot a particular medical problem requires the attention o f a doctor. From 30 to 70 percent of the cases a family doctor sees each day are people who don't really ne ed help. Most patients have discomforts that they can treat themselves or which are self-limiting. Medical self -help courses are designed to teach a layman how to tell the difference between these conditions and the mor e serious ones which do require professional treatmen t. The basis of these programs is a course originated by Dr. Keith Sehnert, author of the best-selling bo ok How to Be Your Own Doctor (Sometimes). 1 I highly recommend this book to all people who are concerned about their health, and to retreaters in particular . The book contains clearly written advice on teaching yo ur- self how to monitor your family's health using simp le medical instruments such as the stethoscope, thermo me- ter, sphygmomanometer, otoscope, and penlight. How to Be Your Own Doctor (Sometimes) includes chapters on general preventive medicine (living lik e you like to live), as well as extensive sections on und erstand- ing your doctor's medical jargon, putting together a \"black bag\" of your own, assembling a selection of emergency drugs and medical supplies, and evaluatin g your doctor. Sehnert also includes a really helpful sec- tion on how to interrogate your doctor to really fi nd out what is wrong with you. It's the perfect preparatio n for LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 98 the patient whose doctor says, \"Take two of these p ills and call me in the morning.\" Within the main body of Sehnert's book is a second book, The Self-help Medical Guide. This manual is t he heart of the matter for retreaters, because it guid es one by a series of questions to a determination of what is wrong and to a decision about whether or not to see a doctor. If professional help is not called for, the guide includes complete instructions on treating the prob lem at home. I have used this guide with my family and I have found it to be comprehensive and easy to follo w. There is one book which you might consider buying as a supplement (or a poor substitute) for Sehnert' s manual. This is The Well Body Book by Mike Samuels, M.D. and Hal Bennett. 2 This book has an excellent section on self-examination but is heavily laced wi th Eastern mysticism and I cannot whole-heartedly reco m- mend it. A \"Family Black Bag Home Health Kit\" containing all the equipment necessary to complement Sehnert's book is commercially available from the Clayton Div - ision of Marshall Electronics. 3 The kit contains a special cut-down version of the book, but I suggest you vis it a bookstore and get the complete text, too. First Aid for Retreaters For the emergency situations which retreaters may have to face someday, standard first aid training w ill be hopelessly inadequate. You may be called on to admi n- ister first aid to persons, possibly loved ones, wh o have suffered severe injuries caused by blast, flash bur ns, flame burns, chemicals, or possibly even small arms . For these reasons a retreater needs a somewhat un- usual manual on first aid technique and lifesaving. The best manual I have seen along this line is the United States Army Field Manual 21-11, First Aid fo r Soldiers, available commercially from Normount Tech - nical Publications under the title First Aid for So ldiers and Sportsmen. 4 This is the manual to consult first in an emergency because it tells you what to do to keep t he victim alive long enough either to get him to a doc tor or to figure out how to treat the injuries yourself. T his book contains all the standard information on bleeding, artifi- cial respiration, closed-chest heart massage, banda ging, and treating shock. It also includes an unusual deg ree of information on first aid for victims of massive wou nds, severe burns, bullet wounds, and poison gas. Have y ou ever stopped to consider how you would give artific ial respiration to a person wearing a gas mask? This ma nual describes two procedures. The chapter on psychological first aid is also unus - ual. Psychological injuries don't show like wounds of the flesh, but they can be just as incapacitating, and special skills are needed to deal with them. The ma nual discusses how to recognize a psychological casualty ,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"how to give first aid, and how to control your own attitude toward a person who is helpless but appare ntly uninjured. (Saying \"Snap out of it!\" usually makes things worse.) If you contemplate being prepared fo r disaster, you will certainly need to give some thou ght to the psychological health of your group of survivors . In one other aspect First Aid/or Soldiers is unique . Most first aid manuals tell you never to move a wou nded person for fear of aggravating injuries. This manua l, designed for use on the battlefield, assumes that t here will be times when the only thing you can do is to pick up and carry the casualty. The details of immobilizing the injury and protecting the patient under these circu m- stances are described at length. As a retreater, yo u may someday be forced to transport a member of your gro up under just such primitive conditions. If that happe ns, you will need this manual. Advanced Self-help Up to this point I have been describing skills whic h fall into the general category of home care or firs t aid. Once you have become qualified to handle routine si tua- tions, what can you do about the more serious medic al problems which may arise? Are there any steps you c an take to further increase your medical capabilities? The isolated position of the retreater may seem unique, but in fact there are several relatively co mmon situations in which laymen are cut off from profess ional medical aid for long periods of time. Scientific ex plorers of the arctic wastes and mountaineering teams in th e Himalayas or Andes are frequently removed from medi - cal aid for weeks or months at a time. Seafarers de velop medical emergencies in mid-ocean when ships are day s from land. In China, where the general population hopelessly outnumbers the doctors, specially traine d paramedics have assumed medical duties of virtually every description. A similar situation prevails in Mex- ico. When the Apollo astronauts were on the surface of the moon, they were about as far from the hospital as anyone can get. You can bet some careful thought we nt into their self-help kit. Finally, there has even b een some formal effort to provide for the needs of isolated survi- vors of a nuclear attack. There are several advanced self-treatment books which you should own. The first is available under two titles. Through the United States Public Health Ser vice, it is called Austere Medical Care for Disaster; you can also find it as Medical Care in Shelters through th e Office of Civil Defense. 5 Austere Medical Care (for the sake of convenience) is the manual supplied with official fallout shelte r medi- cal kits. It covers a wide range of survival medica l ques- tions, but it assumes that you are sitting in a well-stocked shelter and that you will be able to o btain professional help within two weeks at the most. Dis cus- sion focuses on about sixty emergencies likely to o ccur in a fallout shelter. I was particularly impressed with the sections on the medical care of premature and newbo rn infants. In many other departments, however, the ma n- ual is disappointing. Under \"death,\" for instance, it tells you to reassure the dying patient's relatives that death is painless, kind, merciful, etc. It doesn't tell you how to tell if the patient is really dead, though. The man ual is written at about the eighth grade level, and althou gh its overall quality is fairly good I would feel very un comfor- table if this were my only medical book. (I would a lso feel uncomfortable without it, however.) The next manual on my shelf is Medicine for Mountaineering, edited by James A. Wilkerson, M.D. 6 This is a small but detailed manual designed for mo un- taineering expeditions in places where medical help can- not be obtained. Wilkerson's instructions are clear and well-illustrated, and he doesn't hold back in descr ibing what to do until he reaches problems which require major surgery. Under the rugged conditions of moun- taineering, Wilkerson explains, heroic attempts at sur- gery would probably kill the patient faster than th e original sickness or injury. For a few extreme case s, Wilkerson recommends transportation to a hospital a t all costs, but for most conditions the manual conta ins everything you need to know, including how to selec t and administer several prescription drugs. One section of Medicine for Mountaineering is particularly important for retreaters. Chapter 15 d eals exclusively with the prevention and treatment of su n- burn and snowblindness caused by the ultraviolet li ght encountered at high altitudes. Since a nuclear war may allow a serious increase in ultraviolet radiation a t the earth's surface, this information is crucial. In spite of its general quality, Medicine for Moun- taineering has a serious flaw, at least from my poi nt of view. Wilkerson assumes that if you are going to hi ke off into the Himalayas you will be in shape for the tri p. The book does not cover the medical needs of stay-at-ho me types who may have heart disease, ulcers, arthritis , or terminal acne. There is no information about preg- nancy, of course. Even so, this is one of the clear est and most up-to-date medical guides you can get. Don't b e without it. The most comprehensive medical self-help book I have been able to find is Where There Is No Doctor, written by David Werner. 7 This is a really excellent village health care handbook. It was written to be the medical guide for a person living in a remote Latin American village, where medical care is hours or da ys away. If there is a single book which you should ow n on advanced self-help, this is the one. Where There Is No Doctor contains simple and clear instructions for treating everything from abc esses to yeast infections, including every kind of injury and 99 NOBODY MAKES HOUSECALLS ANYMORE"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"disease which is likely to appear in a rural villag e. Its usefulness to us is reduced slightly by Werner's co ncen- tration on tropical diseases and impoverished peopl e, and one feels a certain sense of culture shock when reading it. Many of the procedures are set forth in cartoons to help explain the treatment to an illite rate patient, for instance. Even with these drawbacks, W here There Is No Doctor is by far the best single manual a retreat group can possess. A similar manual has been written for Americans, but unfortunately it is rather out of date. I refer to The Ship's Medicine Chest and First Aid at Sea, publish ed by the United States Public Health Service. 8 This man- ual is nearly 500 pages long and covers every medic al emergency that could possibly happen aboard a ship at sea. The only problem is that The Ship's Medicine C hest was originally written in 1947 and only sketchily r evised in 1956; the medical advice is weak on antibiotics and strong on enemas. (It even suggests enemas for ment ally disturbed patients.) Even though this manual should not be your only medical book, it has a definite place on your survi val shelf. When the time comes for action, you may disc over that you do not have the selection of miracle drugs called for in the more recent books. In that case, you wil l appreciate the value of a manual that tells you how to proceed using epsom salts. In addition, the book co n- tains miscellaneous topics that you will not find c overed anywhere else, such as how to prepare a medical rep ort for transmission to a doctor over the radio. This i s vital. If you have any worries about dentistry or obstet- rics (you should), the manual you will need is Medi cal Handbook for Unconventional Operations, edited by William C. Kothe, M.D. 9 Although this is apparently a manual for military medics, it contains a really ex cellent section on delivering babies and the only useful di scus- sion of do-it-yourself dentistry I have been able t o find. (I particularly liked the first line of the obstetr ics section: \"Do not become involved with obstetrics if there is any way to avoid it.\") There is one more medical book for laymen which I would like to point out because it is unique. This is A Barefoot Doctor's Manual, the official American tra ns- lation of Ch'ih Chiao I Sheng Shou Ts'e, the 1,000- page Chinese paramedical manual. 10 A Barefoot Doctor's Manual is unlike any other self-help book. For one thing, it was written by ph ysi- cians for use by paramedics in a country where the patients vastly outnumber the doctors. The authors assumed that the paramedic would have to serve in t he physician's place almost all the time, and that the para- medic would have to concoct medicines at least part of the time. Altogether, A Barefoot Doctor's Manual is very much the kind of thing a retreater might need following a nuclear attack. Once again there are drawbacks, however, a few of which are really blessings in disguise. The manual covers a wide range of ailments and suggests several metho ds of dealing with each of them. The suggested treatments are acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal remedies, and con- ventional Western medicine. The first part of the l ist sounds like a primitive and motley assortment of te ch- niques, but let me warn you not to take this book t oo lightly. The Western medicine sections are detailed and accurate, as well as being more recent than those i n most American manuals. Although acupuncture is alien to our culture, it really seems to work when used for the relief of pain, or so say many American physicians and dentists who have tried it. Moxibustion is similar to acupuncture, but the treatment is accomplished with small burns instead of pin pricks. As for herbal re me- dies, don't forget that aspirin is just willow-bark tea condensed into a tablet. Many herbal remedies are q uite effective. Detailed, modern instructions for treating injuries and performing surgical procedures are also provide d which you will not find in any other manual for lay men. Where else are you going to find a handbook that te lls you how to perform a vasectomy, for instance? The next few books I want to recommend are not intended for laymen at all. The first is The Merck Man- ual of Diagnosis and Therapy, published by the Merc k, Sharpe and Dohme Research Laboratories. 11 This book contains 2,000 pages of vital information in pocket - reference format for physicians and pharmacists. Mu ch of the discussion is unintelligible to the average reader, but since the scope and depth of the information gr eatly exceeds anything written for laymen, it could be a vital source of information in an emergency. If someone g ets sick and the other books disagree or tell you to go to a hospital. The Merck Manual will fill you in on the missing information. It might tell you exactly what to do, or it might tell you that there is nothing you can do. Either way it will settle your doubts. And what if the problem can't be solved by a hand- ful of pills? What if surgery is necessary? This su bject is probably better left alone by the layman, but I fin d that I cannot resist making a few comments about it. I agr ee with Wilkerson that in primitive circumstances ther e is little point in attempting amateur surgery—the shoc k and inevitable infection would surely doom the pati ent. However, a retreat group of any size ought to be ab le to establish a sterile environment and provide some fo rm of anesthesia; this eliminates Wilkerson's most ser ious objections. If members of your group are injured by nuclear weapon effects or small arms fire, you coul d easily wind up with one or more patients for whom surgery would be the only hope of survival. If one of your friends intercepts a buckshot pellet (or a gla ss splinter) three inches to the left of the navel, yo u can LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 100"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"either write the person off to a prolonged and very painful death or you can try to repair the damage. In this context, the book to get is Emergency War Surgery, published by the United States Defense Department. 12 This manual is written by military sur- geons to brief newly inducted physicians in the tec h- niques of battlefield surgery. Since many drafted doctors are specialists in non-surgical fields (suc h as pediatrics, dermatology, obstetrics, and internal m edi- cine), the directions in the manual do not presume that the reader is at home with surgery. There are a few portions of this manual which are impossibly loaded with medical terms, but the procedures themselves a re very clear. If you are ever unfortunate enough to b e forced into a gun battle in defense of your retreat , you will need this book. Badly. One point I should make here is that most bullet wounds will be in your patient's legs (about 40 per cent), arms (about 30 percent), or head (about 20 percent) . Only about 10 percent of wounds will be in the ches t or abdomen. This is because most of the people who wil l be shot in the chest or abdomen will die before you ca n get to them. Your task will be mainly one of cleaning wounds in the extremities and sometimes amputating limbs, neither of which is a very complicated kind of surgery when your only goal is to save life. The subject of amputation is particularly impor- tant. Before the advent of sterile operating proced ures and antibiotics, the threat of gangrene was so grea t that bullet wounds in extremities were routinely treated by amputation, often by \"surgeons\" who had no formal training, and never with the blessing of anesthesia . In spite of these circumstances, over half of the pati ents lived. One physician I talked to recommended amputa - tion as the \"primitive\" treatment of choice in the case of a large third-degree burn on an extremity. He felt that the stump would be easier to manage than the burn. When you pick up a scalpel, though, remember that you are walking a very thin line between medical tr eat- ment and manslaughter. Such an extreme measure as amateur surgery is justified only when professional help cannot be obtained and it is certain that your pati ent will die without your intervention. Do-it-yourself surge ry is an expedient for a time of complete anarchy and cha os. It would be utterly reprehensible to use it as anyt hing other than a desperate last resort. If you decide to purchase these recommended books for your family or retreat group, you will ne ed at least two additional volumes to help you interpret the previous manuals. First, you will need a pocket med ical dictionary designed for laymen, such as The New Ame r- ican Medical Dictionary and Health Manual, by Rober t E. Rothenberg, M.D. 13 The paramedical manuals are full of such terms as keloid, keratitis and anorexi a, a fact which makes the dictionary very useful. The second back-up book is Gray's Anatomy, the classic text of doctors and medical students for de cades. 14 You will be able to get this edition or maybe even a newer one in any medical school bookstore. A knowl- edge of anatomy could be vital to your patient's su rvival. You might study the appropriate sections of Gray's and decide not to try it. (Note: There are two circa 19 00 nostalgia editions on the market. Get the modern me di- cal text.) The books I have recommended are not the only useful medical and paramedical manuals available. They seem to me to more than cover the information which the non-physician can handle and which the retreater may need to know. If you happen to know o f better resources, please bring them to my attention by writing to me; useful suggestions will be incorpora ted in later editions. Laboratory Procedures There may be considerable doubt that the average person can perform a successful surgical procedure, but performing lab tests is another matter entirely. Th e subject of do-it-yourself medical laboratory work h as been totally neglected in the emergency and surviva l literature, in spite of the fact that many of the t echniques are simple and require little or no training. The medical tests I am thinking of are those asso- ciated with basic urinalysis, blood analysis, and b acteri- ology. The tests of most immediate use to the retre ater are blood tests. The ability to perform A-B-O typin g, RH typing, and donor compatibility tests will be th e difference between achieving successful transfusion s and watching your patients die for lack of blood. T he ability to perform a white blood cell count will be vital to retreaters after a nuclear attack—white blood cell count will be one of your best indicators of the severity of a person's radiation injury. (See Appendix D.) It is a simple test that will leave you in little doubt abo ut who is going to live and who is not. (If you are a well-pr epared group, the test will tell you that you are all fine . That's worth knowing, too.) To perform your own simple lab tests, you will need a copy of Laboratory Section of the Packaged Disast er Hospital, published by the United States Public Hea lth Service. 15 This manual describes nineteen simple lab tests you can perform with a minimum of equipment. Fortunately, the most vital tests are also the simp lest, requiring only a microscope, a few chemicals, and a glass microscope slide designed for blood tests. Yo u could put it all together using a hobbyist microsco pe for about 50 dollars. Medical Supplies Now that you have a selection of medical manuals to consult in an emergency, it is time to consider acquir- 101 NOBODY MAKES HOUSECALLS ANYMORE"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"ing the supplies you will need. There are three pri mary questions to resolve. The first is, which medicines to store? The second is, where to get them? The third is, can they be stored for maximum shelf life? If you don't feel confident in your ability to anal yze long lists of drugs to see if they meet your needs as a retreater, get a photocopy of the Therapeutic Guide for Pharmaceuticals in the Packaged Disaster Hospital. 16 This is a simplified summary of the action, use, ca utions, side effects, and dosage of a hundred drugs which a re particularly appropriate to disasters. This manual tells you everything you need to know to safely use these preparations, but it does not use difficult technic al lan- guage. No retreat medic should be without it. The question of which medicines to store is a diffi - cult one to resolve. As I mentioned previously, gov ern- ment paramedical manuals are mostly out of date, an d in some cases the medicines they discuss are simply not available anymore. Also, I have found that informat ion on the shelf life of prescription drugs is difficul t to obtain. This is critical information; it won't do m uch TABLE 10 \"Moon Kit\" Medical Supplies SUPPLY YEARS OF SHELF LIFE Achromycin Caps 2—5 Ampicillin 1—5 Aspirin Several Bacitracin Eye Ointment 1—2 Benadryl Several Bronkaid Several Cepacol Gargle Several Darvon Compound 5 Di-Gel Liquid 1—2 Debrox Drops 1—2 (tentative) Dome-Boro Tabs Indefinite Emetrol Several Fleet Enema Indefinite Lomotil Several Marezine Tabs Several Merthiolate Several Neosporin Ointment 1—2 Neosynephrine Nose Drops 1—2 Parcpectolin Several Robitussin CF Syrup Several Seconol 5 Senakot Granules 1—2 Sudafed Tabs 5 Syrup of Ipecac Several Tincture Benzoin Indefinite Triaminic Syrup 1—2 Tylenol 5 Vaseline Indefinite Reprinted by permission of the publisher from Keith Sehnert, How to Be Your Own Doctor (Sometimes) (New York: Grosse t & Dun- lap, Inc., 1975). good to stockpile a five-year supply of medicines t hat expire in eighteen months. I have attempted to solve this problem by passing on to you three lists of medicines which I have upd ated from the available literature. I was fortunate to b e able to interest several physicians, a professor of clin ical pharmacy, and a veterinarian in this problem. Their suggestions, combined with available lists, have pr o- vided the basis of what I believe to be a very comp rehen- sive medical checklist for retreat groups. The first list is that compiled by Keith Sehnert fo r How to Be Your Own Doctor (Sometimes). He calls it the \"Moon Kit\" because he based the list on the med ical kit carried by the Apollo astronauts. The list as i t appears in Sehnert's book contains information on c ost, quantity to have on hand, average adult doses, and prescription use, but no information on shelf life. I have supplied the missing shelf life information in tabl e 10. You will notice that the shelf life information is not precise. This lack of consistency is due to variati ons in the quality of the products supplied by different m anu- facturers. Most pharmaceuticals have expiration dat es stamped on the bottles. Be sure your pharmacist includes this information when your order is filled . Those items marked \"indefinite\" will store without dete- riorating for many years provided they are tightly sealed and not subjected to extremes of temperature or moi s- ture. Any item which is opened in normal use should be immediately replaced with a fresh package and remov ed from the stockpile. The second list of medicines was derived from the United States Public Health Service's Austere Medic al Care in Disaster (see table 11). It has been update d slightly, using as few substitutions as possible to allow you to follow the directions in the manual. Some su bsti- tutions were necessary because the manual doesn't s pec- ify the exact nature of the medicine (for example, \"nose drops\") or because the medicine is no longer commer - cially available. The list is intended to supply th e medi- cal needs of fifty people during a two-week shelter stay. In both tables 10 and 11, there are several items which can only be obtained with a doctor's prescrip tion. The items on Sehnert's list are for day-to-day use under the direction of a physician and should not be diff icult to obtain. Show your doctor the \"Moon Kit\" list. Most family doctors will respond by helping you plan you r emergency kit if approached in this way. It might b e even easier to obtain the medicines for the Austere Medical Care list because there are fewer prescript ion preparations than are in Sehnert's list. Don't be offended if your physician doesn't like th e idea of handing you several bottles of narcotics, b arbitu- rates, and antibiotics.

Your doctor may naturally be a little s uspi- cious at first, and it will be up to you to dispel doubts. If your doctor hesitates, you might offer to accept a partial supply at first. You can bring the unopened bottles in at a later date, after you have made two or three rout ine office calls for check-ups, chest X-rays, and runny noses. Once trust is established, your doctor will be more inclined to assist you. In fact, it wouldn't hurt t o talk a little about retreating in general. Who knows? The third list of medicines (given in table 12) is the complete pharmaceutical list from the Packaged Disa s- ter Hospital program. This is a list for doctors, n ot laymen, and consists of all the pharmaceuticals nee ded to run a 200-bed disaster relief hospital for one m onth. These supplies are specifically selected, storable phar- maceuticals appropriate to a disaster situation. I have included information on the minimum useful amount o f each preparation to give you a lower limit, in case your group doesn't feel the need for 6,000 patient-days of supplies. In some cases, the lower limit is the uni t pack- age, while in others the minimum useful amount is t hat required for one full course of treatment. (One pen icillin tablet isn't good for anything.) Notice that this list is intended for the use of a physician in a hospital and contains many items whi ch would not be useful in a remote refuge. Barium sulf ate, for example, is of no use unless you have an X-ray •machine. Soda lime requires an anesthesia machine. I -have preserved the list in its entirety so that yo u (and your doctor) will know that nothing has been left o ut. The Packaged Disaster Hospital list is about ten years old—it is not too outdated, but a few comment s are in order. The clinical pharmacist who revised t he list for me suggested that you include a supply of an am ino- glycoside antibiotic (like Gentamicin) for Gram neg a- tive infections. This was as a partial substitute f or chloramphenicol, an antibiotic on the list which is cur- rently out of favor because of its dangerous side e ffects. Chloramphenicol is still useful for combating typhu s and typhoid fever, both of which are \"disaster\" dis eases, and it has a comparatively long shelf life. It shou ld not be used on radiation victims, however, because it t ends to injure bone marrow and may only aggravate the patient's problems. It would be a good idea to stoc k up on chloramphenicol anyway; three or four years afte r the war, it might be the only antibiotic on your sh elf that is still potent. If there will be infants in your retreat group (or if you contemplate taking in the children of refugees) , it would be a good idea to include a sizable stock of powdered baby formula. Also, you should heavily ove r- stock your \"clinic\" with antibiotics. Burn injuries and radiation sickness both require months of continuou s antibiotic therapy for each patient. I would sugges t a minimum of 100 daily doses per expected patient in addition to the standard supply. This brings up a new problem.

Unless one of the members of your retreat gro up owns a pharmacy and can arrange to enlarge inventor y to suit your needs, there is only one workable poss ibility. You say \"moo\" and go to see a veterinarian. About 90 percent of the items listed in table 12 ca n be obtained as veterinary medicines. These drugs ar e prominently labeled \"not for human use,\" but in man y cases they are exactly the same preparations used i n hospitals. With the exception of certain drugs whic h are never used on humans, these veterinary medicines represent an easy way to build up an emergency drug stockpile. My advice to a retreater is to stick to human medi- cines as much as possible, but to provide large stocks of veterinary antibiotics. Remember also tha t if you offer the medicine to a vet at a discount price three or four months before it expires, it will probably be bought back eagerly. That way the antibiotics aren' t wasted and you can recover some of your invested money with which to buy new supplies. In turn, the veterinarian gets a discount source of drugs (a pri nciple operating expense). What about other medical supplies and equipment, such as bedpans, sutures, bandages, splints, and su rgical instruments? In this area, virtually nothing is res tricted except for hypodermic syringes and needles, which require a doctor's prescription in some states. Onc e again, a veterinary supply catalog-will have most o f the unusual items, and your local discount drug store w ill have the rest. For a few items, like bedpans, you m ight have to resort to a surgical supply store. Table 13 is a list of bandages and similar supplies from The Ship's Medicine Chest and First Aid at Sea , which I felt was sufficiently comprehensive to be included here. The other paramedical manuals specif y stocks of supplies which would be inadequate for an y retreat application; even this list is a little ski mpy. If you would rather do your planning from a really complet e list, you should see Packaged Disaster Hospital Com po- nent Listing and Storage Data. 17 This is the list of every- thing needed to run a 200-bed hospital for a month. It's more than anybody ought to need. In looking over table 13, you should keep in mind that this is not a disaster list. It is more approp riate to industrial accidents. Some adjustments are therefor e in order. (For one thing, a single \"male\" urinal will surely prove inadequate if any of your patients are female s. Some of the small containers and labels for dispens ing pills may not be necessary.) I suggest that this li st would be roughly adequate for a party of five for one yea r in a nuclear war setting.

And what about glasses? What will you do during the attack or disaster if your eyeglasses are damaged o r destroyed? Many retreaters face this question with resig- nation. Others overlook it entirely. Good eyesight is vital to your survival; you should take steps to be sure that it is not imperiled. Save old glasses when the y are replaced by new prescriptions. The old prescription s might not have been perfect for your vision, but in a pinch they will be better than nothing. Just put th e old pairs in with your survival stockpile. Or, order an extra pair of glasses the next time you visit your optome trist. If you get caught without your glasses and desper- ately need clear vision, there is a temporary exped ient you can try which usually works. You can manufactur e a set of corrective \"lenses\" quickly and easily by punch- ing pinholes in a sheet of aluminum foil. Hold the foil up near your eye and look through the holes. This sounds idiotic, but it works pretty well. The pinho les focus the incoming light on the retina of the eye.

LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 110"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"7 To Have and to Hold AT ONE POINT or another almost everyone asks me a question like \"But what do you do when outsiders tr y to barge in and steal your supplies or throw you out o f your own shelter?\" The answer is obvious. You either let them have their way, or you oppose them. If you feel mor ally compelled to share your supplies and survival equip - ment with all comers, you may do so. In that case y ou should skip straight to chapter 8. If not, you will need to give the subject of defense some serious thought. There is one point which I want to make very clear before proceeding. This chapter is about defending a refuge. Any superficial resemblance to the militari sm of right-wing private armies or left-wing revolutionar y cadres apparent here is painfully regretted. Such g roups use the same weapons and methods which I describe i n this chapter, but this is due to the realities of c ombat and not to any similarities in philosophy. I have too m any troubles already to allow readers and reviewers to clas- sify me as a \"hard-line anti-communist\" or a \"left- wing anarchist.\" (Both have happened in the past.) If re aders intend to be prepared for a life-threatening calami ty, they should give some thought to surviving a direct attack on their lives, too. One could easily bring about the other. This chapter covers the problems and methods of defending your group, family, and property against the hostile attentions of outsiders. This is a unique s ubject in a book of civil defense techniques, simply because no government or humanitarian organization is capable of discussing it. If you try to envision the Red Cross telling you the best way to shoot people, you will see what I mean. One of the advantages of producing a book lik e this on a private basis is that one can say the thi ngs that disaster relief agencies regard as taboo. The first question here is a moral one. Are you justified in refusing to share your supplies with a stranger in order to protect the lives of your fami ly and friends? There is a pervasive humanitarian attitude that it is \"noble\" to sacrifice yourself and loved ones for a stranger. I do not agree with this point of view. I feel that I have a moral obligation to warn people of the tro ubled times ahead and show them how to prepare themselves , but once they have been warned, I feel no further o bli- gation to them. I prefer the moral lesson described in Aesop's fabl e of the grasshopper and the ant: All summer long the ant toiled to set aside enough food to last him through the winter, while the grasshopper sang merrily and igno red the ant's warnings of hard times to come. (This sit uation is familiar to all survivalists.) When winter came, the ant was comfortable and well fed, but the grasshopper w as starving and cold. When Aesop has the grasshopper b eg the ant for food, he is posing the exact moral dile mma which troubles retreaters. Should the person with f ore- sight be obliged to succor the unprepared and fooli sh neighbor? Aesop said no. You may dance in the winte r to the tune that you sang in the summer. The next question is also a moral one. If you refus e to share your supplies on the grounds that you have only enough to save yourself and family, are you justifi ed in using force to protect those supplies? I think you are fully justified. If the supplies are your only hope of survival, anyone who attempts to steal or sabotage those supplies is attempting to murder you and your famil y. The principle of self-defense clearly applies. If s omeone is trying to kill you, you are morally justified in resisting to the utmost. I will presume in this chapter that you are a perso n who has taken every reasonable step to be prepared for disaster, and that you will make every effort to av oid trouble when times get bad. If you do get into a fi ght, therefore, you will be in a morally justifiable pos ition, and I will not have to concern myself with whether or not it is right for you to fight. I'll stick to the much simpler question of how you should go about it. 111 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Selecting Your Defense Arsenal To help you get oriented to the world of defensive firearms, I have prepared a discussion of four weap ons which you will want to acquire for your arsenal. I say \"arsenal\" because you will find that one thing inev itably leads to another. Once you decide to defend yoursel f, you discover that you are committed to prepare prop - erly. Otherwise, there is no point in preparing at all. I formed my own ideas of what constitutes a basic arsenal for a survivalist some time ago, and was th en pleasantly surprised to find that most other retrea t planners had come to the same conclusions. There is n't much room for latitude. The realities of combat and the commercial availability of weapons forces everyone into essentially the same mold. For a \"proper\" assortmen t of defensive firearms, each member of your group shoul d be equipped with a military assault rifle, a reliab le com- bat pistol, and a 12-gauge riotgun. This assortment represents the basic defense \"tool kit\" needed for resist- ing an attack on your refuge. Before I discuss actual hardware, there are several philosophical and practical points to make. First, most firearms are not weapons, strictly speaking. They a re sporting equipment. Let me make my point clearer by analogy. Although we all recognize that a baseball bat can be used as a club, we also realize that a bat i s neither designed nor intended for such use, and therefore i s not a weapon. Similarly, a firearm designed for putting holes in a paper target can be lethal, but it is no t a weapon either. Yes, you could shoot and kill a person with such a firearm, but that is not the point. As a survivalis t defend- ing the lives of your loved ones, you are not \"shoo ting to kill.\" You are shooting to live. Although all firea rms have the ability to take a person's life, only a fe w have been designed to save lives. I am referring to firearms designed to fire man- stopping bullets; to shoot time after time without jam- ming; to stand up to misuse and mishandling; to req uire a minimum of skill for effective use; to minimize t he time spent in reloading; and to provide the penetration, range, and accuracy needed for combat. Out of the t otal range of firearms available, only a few meet all of these criteria. These are the military assault rifles. An assault rifle is a wicked-looking black steel an d plastic weapon intended only for combat. It can be operated successfully with a minimum of training an d a maximum of confidence. It will keep firing reliably even under circumstances where a sporting rifle would ov er- heat and malfunction. This is how it saves your lif e—by continuing to fire when a jam or a delay in reloadi ng would be fatal. In my opinion, the question of whic h assault rifle you should buy isn't nearly as import ant as the fact that you must get one. Otherwise, your \"defense\" will be a noisy version of suicide. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 112 In preparing this chapter, I sought the advice of several experts; after comparing their comments I h ave decided to discuss only four weapons. Although ther e is a wide selection of apparently adequate defensive f ire- arms, most have hidden flaws which make them unde- pendable or inappropriate for survivalist use. Fort u- nately, there is one heavy assault rifle, one light assault rifle, one combat pistol, and one combat shotgun of which most survivalists approve. I suggest that you con- fine your shopping to these weapons. They will do t he job—many of the others won't. First on the list is the Heckler & Koch HK91. This is a heavy assault rifle which fires the 7.62 NATO car - tridge, a standard United States military caliber. Many survivalists regard the HK91 as absolutely the best de- fensive firearm available. This rifle will fire tim e after time for hours or days on end without jamming. It i s so reliable that deliberate attempts to jam it usually fail. It is also extremely rugged and amazingly accurate. Me l Tappan (the survivalist gun guru) has reported 100- yard three-shot groups as small as 3/8 inch with this ri fle. This figure represents a center-to-center variation in point of impact only slightly larger than the diame ter of the bullet. (Most combat rifles are doing well to m ake two-inch groups at 100 yards.) In skilled hands the HK91 has an effective range of 1,000 yards, about h alf a mile. The 7.62 NATO cartridge is powerful enough to penetrate trees, car bodies, and brick walls with e nough energy left over to do lethal damage to an attacker on the far side. The rifle can be purchased with a conveni ent collapsible stock, if desired, and costs between 40 0 and 550 dollars, depending on the exact model and the dealer. The second rifle on the list is the Armalite AR-180 , a light assault rifle which fires the standard Unit ed States military 5.56mm round. Compared to the HK.91 , the AR-180 is smaller, lighter, less powerful, and less accurate. Its effective range is 450 yards, but the re is some question about the man-stopping qualities of t he bullet beyond 150 yards. If you are shooting the AR - 180, the guy on the far side of the tree will be re latively safe. On the other hand, this assault rifle is easy for an inexperienced person to shoot because of its light weight and almost total lack of recoil. It is also less expensive than the HK91, selling for 270 to 350 dol lars in most gun stores. The AR-180 comes with an integr al folding stock. The third recommended weapon is the Colt Government Model Mark IV .45 caliber automatic pis- tol, or one of its Colt variants. This model has be en in service with the United States Army for seventy yea rs and is the favored pistol of most combat-shooting h ob- byists. The reader should understand that pistols i n general are under-powered, unreliable, inaccurate, and difficult to shoot.

There really isn't a \"best\" pistol for defense. If you want the \"best,\" you get a rifle. A pistol i s a self-defense first-aid kit which you carry when you want to be armed but it isn't convenient to carry your r ifle (i.e., when you are on top of a ladder washing fall out off the barn roof). The pistol also serves as a second line of defense in case the rifle jams or runs out of ammun ition. It is not a primary weapon—but it is indispensable. The Colt automatic is one of the few pistols for which there is any general approval. Learn to shoot it skillfully and it will save your life in situations where you would o ther- wise be caught unarmed. It costs about 250 dollars. Finally, the fourth weapon on the list is the Remington 870 12-gauge riot shotgun. Survivalists equip themselves with shotguns for special situatio ns, such as close-range confrontations with mobs, night fighting (when aiming is difficult), and firing fro m a moving vehicle. In these situations the massive fir e- power and spreading pattern of a shotgun blast is l ikely to be more effective than single shots from a rifle or pistol. The Remington 870 is a pump gun which, when loaded with eight 2 3/4-inch magnum number 4 bucksh ot shells, can launch 240 pellets in as little as 2.5 seconds. No other kind of firearm even comes close to a shot gun for putting lead into the air. On a pellet-for-bull et basis, a riotgun is the equivalent of ten typical submachi ne guns. Once again, be warned. There are many kinds o f shotguns on the market, but the Remington 870 is th e only one which all of my reviewers, including Mel T ap- pan, agreed would do the job. The Remington 870 cos ts in the vicinity of 175 to 225 dollars, depending on the model and the dealer. The number of weapons to acquire and what order to acquire them in are matters left largely to the individ- ual's judgment. Among survivalists the general rule is to The Colt Commander .45 autopistol, one of the accep table variants on the basic Colt design. This one h as been customized for reliable operation in combat. Note the Pachmayr gri ps, the flat mainspring housing, the oversized slid e release and safety levers, the King-Tappan fixed combat sights, and the long N ational Match trigger. Internal modifications (ramp ing, throating, and trigger job) were also performed. (Customizing by B&B Sales, North Hollywood, California.)

Some people go a litt le farther and buy one spare rifle and pistol for each cou- ple. One riotgun per couple seems to be fairly repr esen- tative. As for the order of acquisition, it would b e ideal (but expensive) to purchase all the weapons at once . Failing that, it is best to start with the assault rifles, purchasing the riotgun and pistols as finances allo w. Persons severely restricted by budgetary limits buy the shotgun first because it is versatile and least exp ensive. Then they buy their rifles, and finally, their pist ols. Firearm Accessories The selection of a proper assortment of accessories for your firearms is extremely important, especiall y because it is a side of defense preparation which i s not immediately apparent. 1 If you do not allow for these accessories in your planning, they can bankrupt you r defense fund very quickly. For an assault rifle, the first essential accessori es are extra magazines. Most assault rifles come with a single five-round magazine. This is the only size t hat can be used for legal hunting, but it is utterly useles s for defense. You will need an assortment of twenty- or thirty-round magazines which hold 150 to 200 cartri dges in total. The exact number isn't critical. Various experts recommend anywhere from 90 to 250 cartridges in mag - azines for each rifle. My preference with a light a ssault rifle is to keep one twenty-round magazine in the r ifle, four more twenty-round magazines in a belt pouch, a nd three thirty-round magazines in a second belt pouch . That gives me 190 shots before I have to reload a m aga- zine. This represents the maximum number of 5.56mm magazines it is convenient to carry. More aren't re ally necessary. Unless you are shooting like a maniac or are very heavily pressed, you can't fire this many shot s without (1) having a chance to reload magazines, (2) having a chance to flee, (3) winning the fight, or (4) getting killed. If you are firing wildly in und isciplined bursts, you deserve to run out. If you are so hard pressed that you can't reload and can't escape, you'll be d ead before you run out of ammo anyway. Don't worry abou t it. (You'll have to pay 100 to 200 dollars for a fu ll set of rifle magazines.) After you get your magazines, you will need a supply of stripper clips and several clip guides. S tripper clips are inexpensive little tin devices which hold ten cartridges in a neat, uniform row. When used with a clip guide, stripper clips help you reload an empty maga zine wry quickly. Although it may take a frantic, fumbli ng person as much as a minute to refill a twenty-round magazine by hand, with the clips the same task can be completed in less than five seconds. The \"guides\" a re essential to the process since they mate the clips to the magazines during reloading. The clips usually cost about 20 cents for a ten-round clip, and the guides run about 80 cents each. It is best to store your entir e ammu- nition supply in clips, and you should also have tw o or three guides for each rifle. They're easy to mislay . If your defense will be conducted where targets more than 100 yards away are a possibility, a teles copic sight will be a significant aid to you. But first y ou will have to order a special scope base (or \"mount\") for your assault rifle. These cost from 30 to 200 dollars. I t is very important that the scope base does not block your v iew of the iron sights and that the base be quickly det acha- ble. If somebody starts shooting and you dive into the nearest ditch head-first, you may bend that expensi ve scope into a pretzel. It is essential for your surv ival that you be able to shift to the iron sights with a mini mum of delay. For combat applications you need a short, rugged scope with about 4X magnification. Some people get variable power scopes (3X to 9X) but these really a ren't necessary. Just don't make the error of getting a 9 X fixed-power scope or some similar high-magnificatio n device. Powerful scopes add marginally to your accu - racy, but they greatly increase the amount of time you spend trying to find the target through the scope. When the \"target\" is shooting back, it is better to empl oy a less powerful scope with a wider field of view. Such a s cope may cost you anywhere from 50 to 650 dollars, depen d- ing on the model you choose. 2 Once you have installed your telescopic sight, you will immediately appreciate the utility of a bipod. This is a simple two-legged support which snaps on the end of the rifle and holds it steady while you squint thro ugh the scope. It will cost you about 15 dollars for the AR -180, or about 100 dollars for the HK91. Many \"civilian\" assault rifles come with a bayonet mount as standard equipment (an odd kind of thing t o find on a rifle supposedly being marketed for hunti ng or target shooting). It would be difficult to think of a situation in which a survivalist would need a bayon et without invoking absurdly unlikely possibilities. I n war it sometimes happens that both sides run out of amm u- nition before the battle is over, and bayonets are brought into play. This isn't likely to happen to s urvival- ists. Anybody who runs short of ammo while attackin g you is going to withdraw, not fix bayonets and char ge. If you run out of bullets, the bad guys will simply sh oot you. No chance for bayonet work there. There is another problem with bayonets. Light assault rifles are not designed for the stresses of bayonet combat. A rifle with a broken stock and a bent barr el will not add much to your survival potential. If yo u feel that you must have one, however, the bayonet for th e AR-180 costs from 15 to 30 dollars; that for the HK 91 costs about 70 dollars. Don't forget to get a cleaning kit for your rifle. 115 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Commercial kits costing 5 to 10 dollars include cle aning rods, bore brushes, solvent, oil, and patches, all of which are essential to routine maintenance. You should al so lay in stocks of oil, solvent, and patches in large quanti- ties against the possibility of lean times ahead. A s for cleaning your rifle, there is some difference of op inion about how often to do it. In the days of corrosive pri- mers, firearms had to be cleaned thoroughly after e ach use or they became rusty junk in a short time. Mode rn non-corrosive primers do not present this problem, and although the rifles do need to be cleaned once in a while, the primary threat to the longevity of the rifle ba rrel is that you may clean it too often. You will have to s trike your own balance in this matter. The last accessory you may wish to obtain is a spar e parts kit for your rifle. I doubt that you will be able to wear out your rifle in actual combat, but you might \"burn up\" a barrel by firing too fast or lose a vit al piece while cleaning it. A spare parts kit for an assault rifle should contain an extra barrel, firing pin, extract or, both front and back iron sights, and a full selecti on of springs. An assortment of miscellaneous tiny pins, screws, and other \"losable\" parts should also be included. Don't forget to acquire a field manual or training manual appropriate to the weapon. The \"exploded\" diagrams in such manuals are very useful when reassembling a gun from pieces. Also, for a su rvi- valist it would be wise to get a good gunsmithing b ook or two and a selection of special tools required for m in- imum maintenance and repair in the field. Suppose you have purchased a full set of accesso- ries for your rifle. Spread them all out on the liv ingroom floor and take stock. There should be seven to ten magazines, a telescopic sight, a bipod, maybe twent y stripper clips full of ammo, two or three clip guid es, a cleaning kit, and perhaps even a bayonet. (We'll ig nore the rest of the ammo and the spare parts kit for no w.) Now here is the challenge: With your rifle in your right hand, pick up the accessories in your left hand and run out of the room, as if someone were shooting at you . Impossible, right? The accessories form a collectio n of thirty to forty separate items—far too many to carr y in your hands or pockets. Fortunately, the military so lved this problem long ago, and for 20 to 40 dollars you can obtain a surplus infantryman's pistol belt, suspend ers, fanny pack, bipod holder, bayonet scabbard, and mag a- zine pouches. The cleaning kit fits in a special co mpart- ment of the bipod holder, and the fanny pack holds your clips of extra ammo, as well as your scope. You can even hang a canteen on the belt. (Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a paramilitary attempt to \"dress u p and play soldier.\" Your rifle's accessories won't do yo u much good if you have to leave them behind or rummage around in a paper bag to find them while under atta ck.) An important word of advice about how to arrange LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 116 the pouches on the pistol belt: Don't put anything up in front next to the buckle. You frequently see thirty -round magazine pouches hung right in front; this is a ter rible mistake. When you throw yourself flat on your face (as you might have to do someday), the magazine pouches swing out into a very awkward position. The effect is like landing on two upturned bricks. If you get lucky, t he pouches don't swing out as you dive. Instead, they catch you sideways—in the groin. Attach them to the belt along the sides of the body, at least as far a round as the hipbone on either side. For the Colt .45 automatic pistol, it is wise to ha ve enough extra magazines to hold fifty or more rounds of ammunition, as well as a cleaning kit, a spare part s kit, and a holster. Getting the right holster is so impo rtant that you really ought to buy three holsters for eac h pistol. One should have a big wrap-around flap to p ro- tect the gun from rain, snow, or mud, if necessary. Another should be designed for speedy access, a use ful attribute when circumstances require it. The third should be a shoulder holster which hangs the gun un der your left arm, where it will not interfere with usi ng a rifle or shotgun. This consideration is more important than it might appear at first, since most people don't wear the p istol while practicing with a rifle. If you try doing bot h at once, you may find that you are always banging one weapon against the other. When the rifle is slung o ver your right shoulder, getting it off in a hurry cart be an awkward and tangled business if there is a big hols tered pistol hanging on your right hip. Better to have th e holster under your left arm in this case. There are about forty custom modifications which people perform on the Colt .45 autopistol, most of which are appreciated only by the true pistolero. T he pistol should be taken to a gunsmith to be throated and ramped, which means a little grinding here and ther e to help the pistol feed recalcitrant cartridges more r eliably. This is a standard modification which nearly everyo ne regards as routine. It is also worthwhile to have t he trig- ger worked on at the same time. I prefer to replace the standard trigger with the longer National Match tri gger, which has a built-in adjustable stop to prevent ove r- travel. The pistol illustrated here has had several exter- nal modifications as well. It has Pachmayr neoprene grips and a special flat mainspring cover, both of which aid the shooter in keeping a tight grip on the pist ol. Oversized safety and slide-release levers make oper ation of the weapon more positive under the pressures of combat. Finally, the standard iron sights have been replaced with highly visible King-Tappan combat sights, which I find exceptionally helpful. 3 Total cost of all modifications was under 100 dollars. Shotguns do not require the range of accessories that rifles and pistols do, but there are a few acc essories"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"for the Remington 870 which are well worth having. The Choate Machine and Tool Company manufactures sev- eral 870 accessories, chief of which are a folding stock with pistol grip, an eight-shot magazine tube exten der, and a very convenient sling (with hardware). They a lso make a device which holds a flashlight parallel to the barrel of the gun. (That's great for nocturnal hunt ing and pest elimination, but suicidal in night combat. ) Don't overlook the fact that you'll need some kind of pouch or bandoleer to carry extra shells, too. Shot shells are heavy and bulky, and you will want to carry for ty or fifty, minimum, when the shooting starts. Ammunition Supply The quantity of ammunition you will need for each firearm will depend on the nature of the gun, its i ntended use, and your expectations about the severity of th e troubled times ahead. Someone who carries a pistol in the street for personal defense is usually content with little more than the number of cartridges contained within the gun. On the other hand, a retreat group of fifty people preparing for a major catastrophe migh t feel the need for hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. What kind of general guidelines can we establish for planning purposes? I have previously said that 150 to 200 rounds in magazines is about the maximum one individual with an assault rifle is likely to need in a single fire fi ght. If you are deliberately aiming your shots, it is difficult to imagine how you could expend more than 1,000 rounds before becoming a casualty yourself. I tend to take the 1,000-round supply as the basic, minimum quantity o f ammunition which should be stored for each assault rifle. For a group anticipating a prolonged period of anarchy, five to ten times this amount of ammunitio n might eventually prove useful, but the probability of any one person being able to expend it all in combat is very small. Remember, too, that any member of your group who becomes a casualty will supply the rest of you with ammunition. (So will casualties from the opposing s ide, if you win.) Just don't get into the endless mire o f always wanting a little more ammunition than you have. You have to draw the line someplace. You don't need as large a stockpile for a pistol as for an assault rifle, because you won't live as long if you are depending on a pistol in a battle situation. Fifty rounds ifo magazines and another 300 in boxes is about the limit. (That's 3,000 rounds for the extended-anarchy peopl e, although how they intend to use it up, I don't know .) You'll need a few additional boxes for periodic tes ting, sighting-in, and similar purposes. If you envision raking the landscape with shotgun fire, you should lay in 1,000 rounds or more for ea ch gun. If the role of the shotgun in your defense wil l be confined to close-quarters kill-or-be-killed action , much less ammunition is needed. In that case, 200 combat rounds per gun is more than enough. That number represents about forty successful face-to-face shoo touts before you run out of shells. If you seriously expe ct to survive more than 40 such duels, you're a better ma n than I am—or you're an incurable optimist. Training Individual combat training is a very complex and sophisticated process, one which very few people wo uld be willing to undergo \"just in case.\" There are a f ew elements of this training, however, which are absol utely essential. If you really expect the firearms to do the job, you must learn to use them effectively. This implie s a basic familiarity with the weapons at the very leas t. Your most minimal training goal should be to teach your group members the fundamental skills they will need to load cartridges into a magazine, seat the magazine in the weapon, advance a round into the chamber, release the safety, fire the round, remove the magazine, check for a live round in the chamber, an d extract it. A person who cannot perform these procedures is dangerous, as well as totally ineffec tive as a defender. To develop practical shooting skills, nothing will do quite as well as Finding a good teacher. The fir st-class route is to enroll in one of Jeff Cooper's courses at the American Pistol Institute. 4 Failing that, inquire at your local gun club. If that doesn't work out, either, t here are many shooting books in print which may help. In thi s regard, be sure to see the catalog from Paladin Pre ss, which contains many titles on sniping, combat train ing, and weaponry. 5 Defense of a Fixed Position The defense of a fixed position is a difficult topi c to approach with any certainty. The difficulty increas es because there is no way to anticipate what kind of force may attack you. The situation most survivalists see m to fear is that during a crisis, a desperate mob or a gang of cutthroats will hear of the food stockpile and come after it. There is also the unlovely possibility of attac k to obtain women (for this there is ample historical precedent) or confrontation out of general meanness . Having the guns and ammunition is just the beginnin g of being ready to resist such an attack. By far the best way to win a fight is to avoid it altogether. If nobody knows about your food stockpi le, nobody will be making plans to steal it. (You might still be vulnerable to systematic looting, but if a gang of desperate refugees starts ransacking every house on your street, you should have ample warning before t hey get to you.) This principle is called \"security of information.\" Before the disaster your special equi p- ment should remain well-hidden, and after the event you 117 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"should do nothing to call attention to yourself. Du ring periods of famine, a well-fed person has either bee n hoarding food or has been indulging in cannibalism. Either way, it's bad if rumors start to spread. Security of information also involves guarding your defenses. Never show your defense preparations to anyone who doesn't have a direct need to know about them. One untrustworthy person visiting your refuge could carry away vital information about your stren gths and weaknesses. Sadly, it is common for a survivali st to encounter people who have prepared for disaster by buying thousands of dollars worth of guns and ammunition—but no food. The implication is obvious. Be very careful when you share your secrets. After you have taken care of the security of information angle, you will need to carefully plan the conduct of your defense. Military manuals will be o f some help, but remember that as a survivalist your goals are not the same as those of an army. Military plan ning tends to be based on the concept of \"acceptable los ses.\" How many members of your family are you willing to regard as acceptable losses? How many close friends ? Your goal as a survivalist must be defense with zer o casualties (on your side, at least). The second point where your methods will have to differ from standard military practice is in the \"c hain of command.\" Survivalists tend to be very independent, and expecting them to unquestioningly obey \"orders\" given by some arbitrarily designated \"commander\" is plainly unrealistic. Soldiers submit to such arrang e- ments because they know they will be shot by a firi ng squad if they refuse, but individual armed survival ists are not likely to conform to that same mold. Your military leader will not be able to sit back and di rect the fight from some safe bunker. The group must be led by example, with the commander out in the worst of it, or you won't have any defense. The third way in which your plans will have to differ from the military pattern is in the goal of your activity. Holding your tactical position is the onl y purpose of your defense. You will not be trying to slow down the enemy advance; you will have to hold your position without any chance of retreat, reinforceme nt, or surrender. The unique circumstances of survivali st defense simplify the situation to a very elementary level: You win or you die. With these philosophical preliminaries out of the way, let's get down to the practical steps to take in planning your defense. A typical infantry attack of a fixed position (such as a machine gun nest) consist s of the attackers dividing into two or more groups (see figure 32). One group creeps forward while the rest of the attackers fire heavily into your position. They don't really intend to shoot you at this point, but are t rying to FIGURE 32: Classic assault of an isolated military outpost. One attacking group forces the defenders to keep their heads down while a second group attacks from very short range. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 118 "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"force you to keep your head down. (That way the cre eps in the grass can crawl up close without getting sho t for their trouble.) When the advance party reaches good cover near your position, they start shooting and k eep you pinned down while the rest of the attackers adv ance. In this manner, the whole attacking band can crawl right up to your door. Then, while several attackers keep you busy by shooting at you, the rest suddenly rush you . A very brief and very fatal close-quarters fight foll ows. That's the approach you have to be able to frustrat e. The first thing to do is to go out to the actual si te you plan to defend and take a good look at it. Walk all around and be sure to get a worm's eye view of all the angles. Locate every possible area of concealment. Get a large-scale topographic map and plot out every feat ure that could hide a prone person. Systematically exam ine every patch of trees, every bush, each rise and dip in the ground. Check ditches, road banks, buildings, hay- stacks, deeply furrowed fields, flower beds, and anything else which might hide attackers from your view. Plot all such areas on your map. Then go back and double-check the areas which seem to offer no conce al- ment. Look at them through the sights of your rifle while tying flat on the ground. Sometimes very slight cha nges in elevation can create areas of \"dead ground\" wher e attackers will be invisible from your position. Now it is time to plot the position of all obstacle s. Is there anything out there which restricts the moveme nts of someone who is trying to sneak up on you? Are th ere any steep hills, cliffs, deep ravines, bramble patc hes, rose hedges, large streams, or overgrown thickets? Plot these obstacles on the map along with the areas of concealment. (Use two different colors.) Draw a circle on your map, centered on your defensive position, with a radius of 1,500 yards. T his represents the absolute maximum distance at which a skilled sniper is likely to be a serious threat. Dr aw another circle (with the same center), representing the maximum range of your rifles (450 or 1,000 yards fo r light and heavy assault rifles, respectively). Take a good, long look at the map and ask yourself two questions : First, is there anywhere within the 1,500-yard circ le where someone might be able to shoot at you, but yo u wouldn't be able to shoot back? If there is, you wi ll need to think about a contingency plan to deal with this problem. The solution might be as simple as buying one or two long-range rifles. At the very least, you wi ll want to keep an eye on these possible sniper locations w hile trouble is brewing. The second question concerns how the areas of concealment and 1he obstacles around your position combine to create corridors through which attackers will be channeled as they approach you. Perhaps a narrow ravine crosses your property. Attackers coul d crawl up the ravine and get near your house without being seen. Even discontinuous areas of concealment may link up in unexpected ways at dusk and after da rk. (At sunset or sunrise, an attacker might cross an o pen area by staying directly in front of the sun. It is very hard to see a figure in the shadows when you have to loo k right at the sun in order to do so.) Once you have identified the natural corridors approaching your position, you can begin to plan yo ur defense. Your planning should concentrate on findin g ways to block the approach corridors and ways to us e the corridors as traps. To seal off corridors, three methods can be used. The first is to remove the cover that allows the en emy to approach unseen. You might cut down a few trees or open up a thicket here and there. You might have to replace a board fence with one made of chain link o r barbed wire. Deep shadows can be dispelled by eliminating the object that casts them or by lighti ng the area artificially. Maybe the dark side of the barn could use a coat of light paint. Most people won't want t o bulldoze a no-man's land around their homesteads, b ut anyone can remove some of the unessential cover. The second way to close a corridor is to obstruct i t with a barrier. That ravine I mentioned earlier mig ht better serve the ranch as a pond. A wild rose thick et or cactus patch can be planted across a line of approa ch. A barbed-wire or chain-link fence forms a very effect ive barrier. Even though such obstacles can be defeated , you can arrange things so attackers must expose themselves or set off an alarm to do so. A few roll s of barbed wire strung concertina-fashion can be set up quickly at critical points. Concertina-wire barrier s are cheap and very formidable when properly arranged. While you are setting up barriers, you might give some thought to blocking the driveway or road that leads to your property. That way no one can come speeding up and penetrate your defenses by surprise . The Cableguard barrier gate, an inexpensive steel c able barrier which can be installed between two moderate ly large trees in about an hour, may be of use to you in this situation. 6 This cable forms a padlocked gate which you can open at any time, but which is extremely diffic ult to force or defeat. The third way to close an approach corridor is simply to bring it into your field of fire. With mo dern rifles it is not necessary to stand on top of an ob ject in order to defend it. After looking at your map of approach corridors, you might discover that the bes t way to protect your house will be to conduct the de fense from a different part of the property. It might be better to establish a stronghold on the hill behind the ho use, for instance. You should especially consider the possibility of spreading your defenders around in t wo or three locations. Three fortified positions with mut ually 119 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"supporting fields of fire can be extremely difficul t to assault. As for setting a trap, once you have identified the approach corridors, your trap is half set already. The trick is to conceal the fact that a particular corr idor has been brought under your field of fire. Returning on ce more to the imaginary ravine which crosses your property, you might decide not to obstruct it, but to leave it as an inviting line of approach. The trap consists of setting up a well-hidden outpost from which your defenders can fire down the length of the ravine. I f your defenders hold their fire until the attackers have crawled well up the ravine, very few of the interlopers wil l escape. The battle will be very brief and very one-sided. T hat's the way you want it. When you are arranging your defenses, remember that cover from sight is worth more than cover from bullets. (If the bad guys can't see you, they can't shoot at you.) You will be safe, and they will be was ting TABLE 15 Safe Thicknesses for Bulletproof Barriers ammunition on every tree and bush in the neighbor- hood. If you will be shooting from an unconcealed position (such as a house), head cover and loophole s will be vital to your success. Trying to shoot through a window or door is suicidal, in spite of the countle ss examples of it seen on television. A wall of sandba gs arranged to allow you to fire without exposing more than a tiny amount of your face is the only prudent course. Even better is to make more loopholes than you need, and then avoid the really conspicuous ones. L et the attackers waste their ammunition and attention on fake targets. While they are plinking away at the o bvious loopholes, you can be firing back from unobvious on es. To see how well-concealed these loopholes really ar e, you will have to view them from the enemy's positio n well in advance of the fight. Remember that what is hidden at one time of the day may be very plain at other times. A word of caution: Be sure that your \"bulletproof barriers are truly capable of stopping bullets. If they won't do the job, they are worse than useless since they show the attackers exactly where you are and give t hem a good target to concentrate on. Barricades intende d to be bulletproof can easily be tested. (See table 15 for the suggested bullet-stopping thickness of common rampa rt materials.) Although it hampers your style a little, there is a fairly secure way to shoot at attackers from within a house. Since your goal is zero casualties, you may find this useful. The technique involves using sandbags to build a small fort, complete with loopholes, set ba ck about eight feet from the exterior wall of the hous e (see figures 33 and 34). You keep the interior of the ho use as dark as possible and fire at the attackers from wit hin this bulletproof nest. In this way you can shoot through door and window openings (and through specially cut loopholes in the external walls), but the attackers can't see the loophole you are firing from. The probabili ty that one of their bullets will find the loophole in your hidden internal fort is very low. The trade off is that your view (and field of fire) is restricted by this tech nique, but defenders occupying several mutually supporting positions can sacrifice a little flexibility for gr eatly increased security. As long as somebody can keep an eye on each approach corridor, the defense will be tigh t. 7 Defense of Moving Vehicles One especially difficult tactical problem is the defense of one or more moving vehicles. A family is extremely vulnerable to armed attack when driving along in a car. If you are traveling in only one car (as a single family group), your main defensive effort should concentrate on avoiding any possibility of trouble. In a LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 120"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" A Loophole behind vine. B Tiles lifted on roof. Dark patches are paint ed on roof as dummy loopholes.

FIGURE 33: Technique of fortifying a house. Diagram shows methods of hiding loopholes to avoid the necessity for firing through windows. (From Combat in Fortified and Built-up Are as. United Slates Army Field Manual Number 31-50. 10 March 196 4.) FIGURE 34: Shooting from internal forts. This techn ique makes it very difficult for attackers to achieve a hit. (Ada pted from S. J. Cuthbert, We Shall Fight in the Streets. Paladin Pr ess. PO Box 1307, Boulder, Colorado 80306, 1965.) riot situation or other large-scale disturbance, yo u will be safest leaving the area just after dawn. Most pe ople are asleep at that time or have been driven indoors by the cold, and yet there is enough light for you to see barricades and rioters in time to avoid them. If the police or National Guard are trying to subdu e disturbance in your area, be sure to time your dawn escape to be after the official curfew period. Othe rwise you could be risking your life. Jittery National Guardsmen can be far more dangerous than rioters. Also, if you will have to pass a police or National Guard roadblock, don't do it in a car bristling with weap ons. You'll wind up in jail at the best, and if you snee ze at the wrong moment you could get shot. If you know from listening to the radio or televisi on that there are no official roadblocks in the area, the need for weapons in the car may outweigh the potential p eril of being caught with them by the authorities. If so , a good arrangement for a single-family vehicle would be to arm the driver with a pistol and place the child ren on the passenger side of the front seat. The second ad ult should be alone in the back seat, armed with a high - firepower weapon such as an assault rifle. The fron t right window should be up to protect the children, but the remaining windows should be open at least two o r three inches. The object is to stick the muzzle of the rifle out either back window and make a lot of noise, panicking the mob of rioters long enough for the dr iver to break off contact and speed away. Note that the rifle is used as a psychological weapon. It is completely irresponsible to shoot into milling crowds when it is so easy to break them up with the sound of the shots a lone. Be sure that the driver is equipped with excellent ear protection. It's needed—the driver's ears could be less than two feet from the rifle's muzzle when you shoo t. If your retreat group is larger than a single famil y, you can take more sophisticated precautions. Modern techniques of mobile reconnaissance on the battlefi eld apply fairly well to a convoy of retreaters. The ba sic requirement is that the group use at least three ve hicles. In this method, the first vehicle contains one skil led driver acting as a scout. The scout probes ahead of the convoy, ranging about 200 yards in front of the sec ond car and locating obstacles, ambushes, or other haza rds that might otherwise entrap the entire party. It is important to realize that the job of scout should n ot 121 TO HAVE AND TO HOLD "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"necessarily be hazardous; the escape route can be planned and studied ahead of time to eliminate or circumvent potential problem areas. The scout approaches blind corners with caution and waits for the second car to draw near if anything looks suspiciou s. The second car in the convoy carries a heavily armed team whose duty is to counter-ambush anyone who attacks the first car, giving the scout an oppo rtunity to escape. The team in the second car should be arm ed with heavy assault rifles and skilled in long-dista nce marksmanship. It would be best to have several members of this team keep the scout under observati on with powerful field glasses at all times. People waiting in hiding to surprise a vehicle tend to concentrate on the first car that comes into vie w and overlook a following vehicle until too late. The mo ment that the scout gets into trouble, the riders in the second car open fire, pouring bullets into every spot that could possibly conceal attackers. The attackers, stunned that their ambush has suddenly turned into a pitched bat tle, dive for cover, and in the confusion the scout has a chance to execute a bootlegger turn and get away. 8 Following another 100 yards behind the second car is the third portion of the convoy. This could be a single car, or several cars, trucks, or buses. These are t he vehicles you are trying to protect. The theory is t hat any ambush will be sprung by the first two cars, preven ting the non-combatants from driving into a trap. Some o f the riders in the third section should be armed wit h assault rifles and shotguns in case someone plans a back- ambush for you, a trap in which the first two cars are allowed to pass but the third section of the convoy is attacked. In this case the second car can reverse c ourse and come to the rescue. In very hilly country or in built-up urban location s where turns in the road put the scout out of sight of the second car, the convoy should proceed \"inch-worm\" fashion. The scout drives forward to the next bend in the road and then stops. If all is clear, the scout sig nals the second car to follow. The third car maintains its p osition just within sight of the second car. In this manner , the scout proceeds one curve at a time, immediately bac ked up by the team in the second car. The third portion of the convoy remains one curve farther back, where it wil l be out of the line of fire if trouble develops. In an emergency when time is running out (the fallout is coming), an alternative to the \"inch-wor m\" technique is to proceed through \"blind\" areas at th e highest safe speed of the slowest car in the convoy , widening the intervals between cars so that no more than one is likely to be attacked before the others real ize it. This is a risky approach, but if the alternative is equally risky you have nothing to lose. It is essential in this kind of convoy to have two or three methods of fool-proof communication between vehicles. CB radios will do for a start, but bear i n mind that attackers may have them, too. A system of headlight-taillight signals and a system based on g un- shots should also be instituted. In addition, every car should have maps of main and alternative routes to the refuge in case of separation. Be sure, however, tha t the maps are drawn in such a way that they won't guide unwanted strangers to your location if they fall in to the wrong hands. Commentary Remember that although you may not be a profes- sional military officer, you can still plan and car ry out a successful defense of your refuge. You can concentr ate your efforts on a single location, and with a littl e luck you will be able to spend months or years in prepar ation before putting your plans to the test. But don't pu t it off.

One resource you should not overlook in planning yo ur defense is the discussion of the Rhodesian guerilla war provided in numbers 1 and 2 o f Bill Pier and Mel Tappan's Personal Survival Letter. The kind of attack that white Rhode sian farmers have learned to frustrate is similar to the situation survivalists envision: con frontation of an isolated family by superior numbers of well-armed soldiers. As an example of th e farmers' resourcefulness, it is common for them to set a switch which turns on lights at a far end of the house. During a surprise night attack, fire can be drawn away from the family for a few seconds—long enough for defenders to grab their weapons and take cover. It's a simple and effective diversion. 8.

There have b een serious threats and counter-threats. A hot war usin g tactical nuclear weapons is taking place in Europe. You have left your city home and arrived at your refuge . In the company of several other families, you are prep aring to dig in and wait it out. Then the bombs start to fall. You're on your own. What do you do now? This simple question is probably the least discusse d and the most crucial question in retreat planning. Once you get your ten or twenty or fifty people into you r fallout shelter—what do you do then? How do you kee p their spirits up? How do you organize them to do th e work that needs to be done? How do you keep them from panicking? From losing hope? This is the problem which the Civil Defense people refer to as shelter management. They have spent muc h time and effort on this subject, and the Shelter Ma nage- ment Textbook is one of the most useful publication s in the whole preparedness field. 1 One of the only useful publications, in fact. That doesn't mean that the official approach to shelter management is not flawed, however. The peop le who laid down the rules for shelter living were out of touch with reality on many points. In official shel ters, for instance, the shelter manager or the manager's depu- ties are required to go around among the shelterees and confiscate all food, drugs, alcohol, and firearms. Now I admit that in certain parts of the civilized east y ou might be able to get away with that, but any fool who tri es it in El Paso, Texas or Great Falls, Montana is going to get shot for his trouble. (Every time I read those inst ruc- tions I mentally picture some pompous official in a CD armband trying to confiscate Mel Tappan's forty-sev en- gun \"basic no-frills\" survival arsenal.) The short-sightedness of rules like these has occa- sionally shown up in real-life emergencies. The con fisca- tion of alcoholic beverages is one such example. Du ring hurricane Camille, the CD \"security team\" for a lar ge public shelter discovered a room full of alcoholics who had somehow sneaked out into the storm and looted a liquor store. When discovered, they were quietly dr ink- ing themselves into a stupor. Righteously, the secu rity team confiscated the booze and destroyed it. Within a few hours, they had a growing number of winos with alcohol withdrawal convulsions and delirium tremens — and no medical help. Fortunately, private disaster preparedness is a remedy for such official myopia. You can prepare ah ead of time and provide better food, better accommoda- tions, and better leadership than the official shel ters can offer. This chapter is a guide for the shelter lead er which tells how to manage a group of people to give them the best chance of survival. I have also included certa in suggestions about equipment and supplies, where appropriate. Leadership One of the sad things that modern psychology has taught us is that a natural leader is someone who i s tall, has a deep voice, and is strongly prejudiced. Of th e three, the prejudice is the most important quality. Having made up his mind beforehand about nearly everything , the natural leader is ready with a course of action while everybody else is still trying to figure out what t he problem is. The natural leader always has a plan an d always acts confident. Of course, he is also wrong most of the time. Your retreat group will need leadership. In some situations, a confident leader, even if wrong, will con- tribute more to your survival potential than any ot her factor. Such a leader will inspire people to work t ogether and to look forward with some assurance to a hopefu l future. This is absolutely necessary. If your group does not have a natural leader, you can fall back on you r own 125 WAKE ME WHEN ITS OVER"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"resources and perform the same function even better by imitating the behavior of the natural leader while substi- tuting rational plans in place of blustery posturin g. The principles of leadership are as follows: 1. Assume command rapidly. Like the natural leader, you must begin to organize your group members and direct them before they get their bearings. 2. Demonstrate authority. That is the official jargon for \"act like a leader.\" Take charge, display the fact that you know what you are doing. Act confident and well-organized. 3. Delegate authority. The leader's responsibility is to oversee all aspects of life within the retreat grou p during the crisis, but it is a mistake to get bogge d down in every petty detail. Delegate. Don't let vit al tasks be left undone because you personally cannot perform them. 4. Refrain from personal overinvolvement. That means don't play favorites in the retreat—not if you want to remain the leader. 5. Establish a priority of action. First things first. Make a list of the things that need to be done and decid e which are the most important. The list will help yo u resolve conflicts in your own mind and will preclud e differences of opinion among your shelterees. Remember, you don't have to be right. But you do have to be ready to answer when someone asks, \"What next?\" 6. Provide an example of behavior. Make a strict point of following your own rules and of living exactly l ike the people you are trying to lead. Be energetic, ho pe- ful, helpful, and your followers will respond in ki nd. 7. Recognize the changing needs of the group. At first , the people in your group will need to be reassured, guided, organized, and generally cared for. Later, they will be able to function well on their own, an d you will be faced with the task of keeping them occ u- pied. Even later, your primary function may be to encourage them to be patient and not leave the shel ter too soon. 8. Recognize the need for compromise. Even under the best circumstances there will be situations where t wo legitimate but opposing needs will have to be recon - ciled. Be ready with a compromise, or be ready to firmly back one side. Don't let a general debate ge t started. You won't have the time to spare. Management Objectives Once you know how to act like a leader, you will need to have a clear idea of the goals you are tryi ng to accomplish. Obviously, the survival of the group is the main goal, but there are several lesser objectives which will contribute substantially to your survival. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 126 The first of these is to rapidly organize the group members into \"teams\" responsible for various vital func- tions in the shelter. The size and composition of t he teams will depend on the size of your total group. (Clearly, there will be little point in assigning \" team leader\" titles to the members of a group composed o f only four people.) Large groups, on the other hand, may require extensive organization. In general, you will need to assign teams to meet t he following needs. First, you will need a radiologica l defense team to begin immediate work monitoring you r fallout meters and watching for the first grains of fall- out. You will need a security team, too, as well as a medical team, a communications team, a food-and- water team, a safety team (for fire prevention and con- trol), a ventilation team, a sanitation team, and p erhaps even a few other special groups, depending on your situation. Assign your people to these teams rapidl y and direct them to begin their duties at once. Later on , you can sort out individual skills and change assignmen ts to make the best use of everybody's abilities. At firs t, the emphasis should be on speed, not efficiency. The second task is to obtain information from your teams which will allow you to clearly define your s itua- tion. How much food and water do you have? What problems can your medical team foresee? What news from communications? Will ventilation be adequate? What fire hazards are there? Has any fallout arrive d, and if so, how rapidly is the external radiation ha zard building up? Does the security team report any sign of strangers near the property who might be inclined t o force their way in with you? You should build as co m- plete a picture as possible of the expected duratio n of your stay in the shelter as well as an appreciation of your capabilities and the hazards which the shelter itse lf may represent. From this assessment of your situation, you can begin to set up an actual survival plan. The next step is to develop your rules for shelter living and to set up a detailed daily schedule. The rules and schedule will give the members of your group a framework within which to live as a substitute for the way of life they have left behind. The rules will h elp prevent conflicts and problems, while the schedule will allow everyone to settle into a predictable pattern . The importance of this step must not be underestimated. The fourth step is really the most crucial part of the whole effort. Managing for survival is really direc ted at maintaining the group's morale and preventing members from getting bored, morose, depressed, and defeated. The Golden Rule of shelter management is keep them occupied. We will return to this primary theme again and again in this chapter."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Shelter Schedule The following is a sample shelter schedule which you may adopt. I have annotated it to briefly expla in the use of some of the time periods. Most are either se lf- explanatory or are covered in detail later in the c hapter. 7:00 AM Reveille (rise, clear away bedding, dress , etc.) 7:30 AM Prepare breakfast. 8:00 AM Serve and eat breakfast (water ration). 8:30 AM Clean up after breakfast. 9:00 AM Sick call (a general medical inspection and discussion of medical topics, if necessary). 9:30 AM Leader's option of continuing sick call or starting training sessions, recreation time, group meeting, etc. 10:00 AM Snack time (water ration). 10:30 AM Training session (entire group). 11:00 AM Training session (special groups, inclu ding school for the children). 11:30 AM Free time for quiet activities (nap time, etc.). 12:00 PM Prepare lunch. 12.30 PM Serve and eat lunch (water ration). 1:00 PM Clean up after lunch. 1:30 PM Information and training session, nap time for small children. 2:00 PM Information and training session, school for the children. 2:30 PM Emergency drills (finding emergency exits while blindfolded, fighting mock fires, etc.). 3:00 PM Snack time (water ration). 3:30 PM Recreation (free time). 4:00 PM Recreation (free time). 4:30 PM Recreation (quiet activities, nap time). 5:00 PM Prepare dinner. 5:30 PM Serve and eat dinner (water ration). 6:00 PM Clean up after dinner. 6:30 PM Official daily briefing (team leaders repor t to the group; discuss and make group decisions). 7:00 PM Training session. 7:30 PM Planned recreation (group singing, etc.) 8:00 PM Planned recreation (radio, television view- ing, etc.). 8:30 PM Free time for quiet activities (some people will want to turn in early). 9:00 PM Free time for quiet activities. 9:30 PM Snack time (water ration). 10:00 PM Free time for quiet activities. 10:30 PM Prepare for sleep. 11:00 PM Lights out. 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM First night watch. 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM Second night watch. 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM Third night watch. 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM Fourth night watch. This schedule is a loose framework which you can alter to suit your needs. For example, first and se cond, and third and fourth night watches might be combine d. You or the group can decide to change the schedule at any time, but don't change it too often or you will lose the reassuring psychological sense of routine. Shelter Rules The retreat leader must deal very early with rule- making. The shelter living situation will be novel to everyone, and at least a few carefully designed rul es will be necessary to insure the survival of the group. T hat is the key. Any rule, any decision about a rule, and a ny disciplinary action must be clearly in line with th e survi- val goal, or your group will rebel. You will need rules for several functions. First is entering and leaving the refuge. Your group should know, in very clear terms, exactly who can enter an d what they can bring with them (preferably, well in ad- vance of the crisis). If the basic family unit of p arents and children belongs in the retreat group, what abo ut Aunt Mary and Uncle Bill, who were visiting with th e family? How about pets? How about strangers? You must know clearly where you will draw the line. You can't save everybody. Leaving the refuge is equally trou- blesome. Your rules must cover who, when, and for what reason a person may leave the shelter or the p rop- erty, if only to impress on children (and some adul ts) that it is dangerous to go outside. Then there are the rules which cover day-to-day living within the shelter. There must be clearly de fined limits on how much food and water each person is entitled to in a day, as well as rules against misu sing supplies. People under stress frequently show it by snacking. In that direction lies a band of fat retr eaters with no food left in the stockpile. There must be r ules covering who will dispense medicine (to prevent was te) and rules covering the time and duration of quiet h ours, when people may expect to sleep undisturbed. Finally, there are special rules. You will have to decide for yourself what you think of smoking, alco hol, drugs, sex, gambling, and fighting. These decisions will depend on your circumstances. Just remember, the ca r- dinal rule is to prohibit anything that reduces the 127 WAKE ME WHEN ITS OVER"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" High-range Civil Defense fallout meter available fro m Survival, Inc., 16809 S.

Don't fall into the trap of proscribing activities just b ecause they \"aren't nice.\" There is more than enough of th at advice in the official books. While you are working up your list of rules, bear i n mind that restrictions will be better received if y ou leave a few for people to set for themselves. The determi nation of quiet hours could readily be made by group membe rs, for example. As long as you have a definite eight-h our period in which people can sleep, it doesn't really matter when it is. Let your group decide for itself. This makes the whole issue of rule-making less arbitrary. Radiological Defense Detecting, measuring, and keeping track of fallout radiation levels is a vital activity for a retreat group for three reasons. First, you will need to know exactly who has been exposed to exactly how much radiation. Thi s will allow you to choose the right people to send o utside on brief but important errands (such as getting the can opener out of the car). Second, taking definite act ion to measure and record radiation dosages will reassure your group that you really are doing everything you can to keep them safe, and will dispel members' inevitable fear that they are dying of invisible radiation. Third, the time the group will spend in taking measurements and cal cu- lating cumulative doses will be time that you will not have to find ways to fill. There are several approaches to acquiring radiation detection equipment, some very expensive and others extremely economical. On the expensive side are the sensitive survey meters sold for use in health phys ics applications. These meters are much too sensitive f or most civil defense work, but they can be useful in decon- taminating people and equipment. A sensitive survey meter (detecting 0 to 0.5, 0 to 5.0, and 0 to 50 mi lliroent- gens per hour) will help you get the last vestige o f fallout out of your hair and out from under your fingernail s. You can buy such meters, intended for the measureme nt of gamma and beta radiation, for prices ranging between 250 and 400 dollars, depending on your sour ce. For nuclear war radiation dose rate measurements, however, you will need a meter that will measure ra dia- tion levels greatly in excess of those indicated ab ove. Official civil defense fallout meters give readings in the 0 to 0.5, 0 to 5.0, 0 to 50 and 0 to 500 roentgen per hour range, more than 1,000 times higher than a health p hys- ics instrument can manage. Unfortunately, these ins tru- ments are not routinely manufactured any more. If y ou want one, you will have to buy it on the surplus ma rket or you will have to build one yourself. At the time this book was written, Survival Inc. was offering surplus civil defense CD V-710 survey meters for a very reasonable price. I recently purc hased and tested seven of these meters and found them to be in operating order. They responded well to a cobalt-60 gamma source and unquestionably represent one of th e best bargains in the whole field of survivalism. Th ey run for 400 hours on two D-cells and a Mallory M-215 22 .5v battery (available at Radio Shack). An alternative to buying the meter as surplus is to build it yourself. This is easier than you think. C resson Kearny of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory recentl y completed a set of step-by-step instructions on how to assemble an accurate and dependable fallout meter f rom materials normally found around the house. 2 Unfortu- nately, his budget allowed him to print only 100 co pies of the plans, all of which went into files or libra ries. (See Appendices in the back of this book for detailed in struc- tions of Kearny's meter.) Dosimeters are another kind of radiation measur- ing device, used for automatically recording the to tal radiation exposure received by a particular person. A dosimeter is a pen-like device which clips to your belt and is worn all the time. At any moment you can unc lip it, look into the end of the device, telescope fash ion, and read your personal total exposure on a tiny interna l scale. A dosimeter needs recharging about once a we ek, for which you must buy a special recharger. The recharger costs about 60 dollars; each dosimeter al so runs about 60 dollars. For gamma radiation, get dir ect- reading dosimeters in the 0 to 200 R or 0 to 600 R range. I recommend that a well-equipped retreat group have a high-range civil defense survey meter at the very least. The ultrasensitive health physics survey met ers are second in priority, and although useful, are not es sen- tial. A full set of dosimeters will be reassuring t o your group, but again, they are not essential. Be sure t o buy extra batteries for the meters and dosimeter charge r; store them in the refrigerator. You may be able to find sources for radiation detec - tion equipment just by looking in the yellow pages.

The easiest way is to place a white plate or a sheet of paper o utside on the ground and check it every few minutes. When the fallout arrives, it will appear as a sprinkling of grit on the paper or plate. At night, you will be able to see t he grains descending like snow through the beam of a flashlig ht. Although radiation is invisible, the fallout grains are not. Until the fallout does arrive, the radiological defense team can be kept occupied with tasks that improve the shielding around the shelter. Piling sa nd- bags against exterior walls is an example of such a ctiv- ity. The team should collect hoses, brooms, and buc kets of water to store outside the shelter entrance. Thi s will speed up the decontamination of the premises later. If possible, the team should plow the land within 100 feet of the main building and parking area, leaving deep furrows. This will greatly cut down the radiation e xpo- sure of persons in the center of the plowed area. ( Plow the furrows in circles around the building like the grooves in a record, not radially like the spokes o f a wheel.) The second duty of the radiological defense team is to decontaminate incoming group members who arrive after the fallout. Imagine that the people to be de con- taminated have had a few ounces of ground pepper thrown at them, and that your job is to get it off their clothes and out of their hair without breathing it. The best arrangement is to have the contaminated people shower and shampoo several times; then check them over closely with a sensitive survey meter. Pay par ticular attention to all hairy areas and folds of skin. If shower facilities and survey meters are not avai la- ble, you can make do by thoroughly brushing the hai r and carefully dusting off the person's clothes. Don 't forget the shoes, which are likely to be heavily co ntami- nated. Tell group members to report any itching aro und the ears, neck, armpits, or ankles—fallout can ente r the clothing and lodge against the body. Itching may in di- cate the first stages of beta burns, and the affect ed area should be carefully washed at once. (See Appendix E for additional information about beta burns.) A professional decontamination team at work. Althou gh workers are taking elaborate pains to see that no r adioactive material touches them, the fundamental activity is no more complex than scrubbing the floor. (Photograph court esy of Nuclear Associates, Inc., 100 Voice Road, Carle Pla ce, New York 11514.) The third duty of the radiological team is to keep careful and accurate records of the radiation level out- side the shelter. For one to several hours after th e first fallout arrives, the readings will continue to rise , but soon they will peak and begin to drop. At any time following this maximum level, you can use the dose rate measurement and the estimated time since the explos ion to calculate how long you will have to stay in the shelter. (This, obviously, is a vital piece of information. The technique is described fully in Appendix E.) If food and water thought to be contaminated is brought into the shelter, the radiological team sho uld examine and decontaminate it as soon as possible. Radioactive fallout must not be eaten. Although I stressed in chapter 2 that the long-term radioisoto pes which will eventually work their way into our bodie s are not a very great cause for individual concern, actu al fallout grains are another matter entirely. Don't e at fallout contaminated leafy vegetables. If you have nothing else to eat, wash the leaves carefully firs t. The same goes for apples and other fruits. Some vegetab le products such as apples, oranges and potatoes form their own \"containers\" and can be decontaminated by washing or peeling. Other foods, like unwrapped bre ad or unwrapped fresh meat, can be best decontaminated by carefully cutting off the outer layers and savin g only the uncontaminated inner core. You may find that th ere LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 130"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" will be still other kinds of food that can not be t reated at all, such as individual slices of bread. These shou ld be disposed of outside. Food in sealed containers (cans, jars, bottles, or plastic bags) is edible as long as no fallout gets on the food itself. The exposure of the food to the radiat ion alone does not affect the edibility of the food. (M any grocery store foods on your shelves right now have been sterilized by radiation as a routine commercial pro cess.) You can decontaminate the food by washing the outsi de of the container or by wiping it carefully with a d ry cloth. The meat from cattle which have received a lethal dose of radiation may be used for human consumption , but only if the slaughtering is performed within th e first week following exposure and the animals have not eaten any fallout. After that, the animals become b acte- remic, and their flesh constitutes a source of food poi- soning. They literally rot on the hoof and become i nedi- ble while still alive. If the animals have eaten fa llout you will run a risk of receiving a dose of radioactive cesium from their flesh. This should be avoided if possibl e, but remember that it is far less harmful than outright starva- tion if that is the choice. Water brought in from local streams or ponds should be purified as described in chapter 5 by str aining and running it through an activated carbon filter t o remove radioactive chemicals. A standard home water softener will also remove most of these chemicals. Be sure to add a few drops of iodine to each gallon to kill germs and to help prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland. The final and most important duty of the radiolog- ical team will be to determine when it is safe to g o outside. As a general rule, a person can withstand up to 6 R of radiation per day in a nuclear war context w ith- out serious ill effects. By the time the outside ra diation dose rate has fallen to 2 R per hour, it will begin to be safe to go outside. At this level, a person who has not been exposed to too much radiation previously can afford to stay outside for up to three hours per da y. As the dose rate continues to decrease, the periods of out- side activity can be made proportionately longer. ( See table 20 in appendix F.) Sanitation As 1 remarked in chapter I, we tend to take proper sanitation for granted. Virtually every building an y of us has ever seen has contained a flush toilet. We cons ider ourselves victims of governmental neglect when we a re confronted by such an outrage as a pit toilet in a national park. Like it or not, the success or failure of your retr eat group could well depend on the strength of your san itary resources. Poor sanitary facilities can quickly pro duce disease and demoralization. If you haven't really c onsid- ered the toilet question, a big part of your surviv al planning has been left undone. Official fallout shelters are provided with garbage cans or metal drums with toilet seats to serve as c om- modes. Once again, you can do better. Portable flus h toilets can be purchased for reasonable prices in m any department stores. Powerful deodorizing chemicals a re also available. Even if you decide not to buy a toi let, you should get the chemicals. The official suggestion is to have one commode for every fifty people under optimal circumstances, but I suggest that you provide two or three times that ma ny toilets—you might develop a group diarrhea or nause a problem. The toilets should be partitioned off from sight and sound nearthe point wheretheventilation air lea ves the shelter and as far from the food preparation ar ea as possible. You can isolate each individual toilet or group them into men's and women's facilities. If your gro up is very informal, you can have \"unisex\" restrooms, but I don't recommend it except within family groups. Remember that your purpose is to promote a sense of routine, and radical departures from the patterns o f day-to-day living will not help. 131 WAKE ME WHEN IPS OVER The Pak - A - Potti. A flushing portable toilet available from Sears; no shelter should be without one."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The cleanliness of the toilets and surrounding area is also important to health and morale. (The CD peo ple suggest that everybody should do everything sitting down to avoid spattering, and that toilet-trained b ut still small children should be supervised.) The medical t eam should supply soapy water for washing hands. One really staggering problem is posed by the admittance of an infant into the refuge. You can ex pect to have to deal with a ballpark figure of 200 to 40 0 dirty diapers per month per child. This is your single la rgest argument for having the ability to do laundry. Adul ts can just rinse out their clothes now and then, but diapers have to be properly washed. The alternative is to l et the kids run around naked in a restricted corner of the shelter and to clean up after them as need be, like puppies. (That suggestion is straight from the offi cial guide.) While you are stocking your refuge, don't overlook sanitary napkins, toilet paper, and bathing soap. T he person who forgets to stock the shelter with these items may well be sent back out to get them. Safety If your retreat group is forced to live for several days or weeks in the confined quarters of a fallout shelter, the group leader must be extremely sensiti ve to the hazards inherent in the shelter situation itsel f. Don't concentrate so much on the dangers outside that you overlook the calamities which can happen within the shelter. Of primary concern is the possibility of fire. You will have many people in a relatively confined spac e. You will have cooking stoves, candles, and perhaps sparks from electrical equipment as ignition source s. You may have white gas stored for stoves, gasoline for the generator, and goodness knows what kinds of gunpowder and explosives if you belong to one of th e more security-conscious groups. It all adds up to t oo many people in too small a space with too much dang er- ous fuel. Safety precautions will be extremely important. Precautions will fall into two categories. First, y ou must take steps to see that fuel (and ammunition, i f applicable) is stored as far as possible from the c ooking area, preferably next to the toilets and near the v entila- tion exit. This will be a most emphatic no-smoking area. Flashlights, not candles, should be provided for pe o- ple visiting the toilets at night. Be sure that the main sleeping area is immediately adjacent to one or mor e exits, and that there is nothing near those exits t hat could possibly catch on fire or fall over and block the door. Your last job every night should be to check the exits to be sure that they are unobstructed. The second precaution is to train everyone in what to do if there is a fire. Members should be able to get up LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 132 from their normal sleeping locations and crawl to t he nearest exit by feel, not by sight. Run that drill at least once a day. Teach everyone how to put out burning clothing by wrapping the victim in a blanket: gasol ine- soaked clothing can't be put out by rolling on the ground. Place buckets, cans, or boxes of sand at various locations around the shelter and asign specific fir e- fighting duties to persons normally nearby those po ints. Don't use water or chemical fire extinguishers, at least not at first. Water will spread a gasoline fire, an d most chemical extinguishers will release smothering gase s. Chemical extinguishers put out the fire, but they w ill also drive you out of the shelter. Keep the carbon diox- ide extinguishers and several buckets of baking sod a in reserve. If the fire can't be controlled with sand, get everybody outside and then use the chemicals. Be su re everybody understands that in a choice between radi a- tion and exploding gasoline, the radiation is the l esser evil. Ventilation You will need about three cubic feet of air per person per minute circulating through the shelter i n order to avoid carbon dioxide buildup, oxygen deple - tion, high humidity, high temperature, and that unm is- takable locker-room smell. The ventilation team wil l be responsible for air quality and air-related safety. In Appendix D I have included drawings of the Kearny A ir Pump (KAP). This is a simple \"flap-valve\" air pump which you can make from items found in any house. A kind of Venetian blind that opens when it swings aw ay from the shelter and closes (pushing air ahead of i t) when it swings toward the shelter, it may be used i n a door, window, or hallway to provide ventilation. If the KAP will be used to insure adequate ventila- tion, be sure to check first to see in what directi on the air naturally flows through the shelter space. Open up the air intake and exhaust hatches, window, or ducts an d see if there is a natural flow. Always install the KAP so that it operates in the same direction as the natural ai r flow. If you try to force the air to go against its own i nclina- tions, you won't have much success. It may have occurred to you that fallout particles might be sucked into your shelter by your ventilati on pump or blown in by a draft. If you have a powerful ventilation pump, you might want to filter the inco ming air through a common furnace dust filter, but if yo u are using a low-pressure high-volume pump (like the KAP ), you won't need this precaution. Even the slowest fa llout grains fall like snow, at rates of about half a foo t per second. These settle to the ground very quickly. Yo u won't have any fallout in your air supply if you ar range your ventilation so that the air enters through gro und- floor windows that have been left slightly open, us e a"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"KAP in the basement stairwell to pump air from the ground floor to the shelter, and let the air exit t hrough a basement window. It is possible that a small amount may enter the house, but it won't get down to the s helter. The ventilation team should be constantly on guard for gases which might pose a danger. Carbon dioxide from breathing or carbon monoxide from stoves and Coleman lanterns are two examples of potentially da n- gerous gases. If people start fainting and their li ps look either blue or cherry red—it's time to go outside. Fast. Blue lips mean lack of oxygen. Bright red lips indi cate carbon monoxide poisoning. Retreaters frequently bu y hand-powered ventilation air pumps to help stave of f this kind of problem, but there are simpler ways, t oo. If you bring a generator inside the shelter and provid e a pipe to channel the exhaust to the outside, your ai r- pump problem will be solved. Internal combustion engines are powerful air pumps, and even a very sma ll gasoline generator will keep fresh air circulating through your shelter as long as it is pumping exhau st to the outside. A fireplace or wood stove vented to th e outside has exactly the same effect. The fumes from stored gasoline within the shelter will be a particular problem. The safety team will want to locate the gasoline storage area next to the ven tilation outlet so the fumes will be carried directly out of the shelter: the ventilation team will probably agree. What they may not agree on is where the cooking stove sh ould go. The safety team will want the cooking area to b e as far from the stored gas as possible. The ventilatio n team may want both the gas and the stove near the outgoi ng air duct. The group leader will have to resolve suc h opposing desires. Shelter managers are frequently preoccupied with the possibility of too much heat and humidity in th e shelter. I want to caution you about this fear. It is true that in overcrowded public shelters the heat of 200 to 600 bodies can quickly raise the temperature to una ccep- tably high levels, but a family or small retreat gr oup in a concrete basement is going to be too cold, not too hot. You must look over your situation carefully and dec ide which category you fall into. If your shelter is li kely to be too cold, you will want to plan on forms of cooking , lighting, and recreation which will raise the tempe ra- ture. If your shelter is likely to be too warm, you will need pre-cooked foods and cool light sources. In ei ther case, you will want to take steps to keep the level of humidity as low as possible. Humidity makes a hot shelter feel even hotter, and it makes a cold shelt er damp and miserable. More ventilation is the cure in eith er case. Illumination and Power The period in which your group may have to be confined in a crowded fallout shelter will be one w ith many difficult emotional overtones. If you have to spend those days trapped in total darkenss, your su rvi- val potential will be very low. Even those of us wh o do not normally fear the dark may find that the total dark- ness of a night in a shelter may be more than we ca n stand. (This has been indicated in shelter simulati on studies.) Imagine what the effect would be on claus tro- phobics and insecure children. In many parts of the country, commercial power supplies will not be knocked out by a nuclear attac k. Coal and oil powered generating stations may be abl e to stay in operation for days or weeks, at least until the fallout has decayed to the point that people can co me out in the open again. Nuclear reactors will contin ue to generate electricity for a year or two after the at tack, provided only that the operating crews stay on the job. Hydroelectric dams will work even longer in many areas. If you live in such an area, you may be able to use normal electric lighting during your shelter stay. If not, you will have to provide illumination some other way. As well-prepared retreaters, you have no excuse for not buying a small gasoline-powered gene ra- tor and storing enough fuel to keep it running for a week or two, until you can leave the shelter. Battery-po wered lights are useful, too, as are candles and kerosene lamps. White-gas Coleman lanterns produce the brightest li ght available from a non-electric source, followed clos ely by large kerosene lamps, battery lanterns, and candles , in order of diminishing intensity. Small kerosene lamp s are frequently dim and smoky. Votive candles make good night-lights. An enclosed flame is less bright than an exposed flame , but the enclosed flame presents less of a fire hazard. The fire problem is also why I prefer candles to liquid-fuel ed lamps. If a candle falls off a table, it will usual ly put itself out. If a kerosene lamp falls off the table . . . During the day, you may be able to bring light into the shelter by using mirrors set up in entrances to reflect sunlight. Be sure to maintain a reasonable day/nigh t cycle of light and dark periods. It is fine for Esk imos to live on a twenty-four-hour free-running cycle, but mod- ern Americans won't take to it very well. They will develop psychological, and perhaps even physical, p rob- lems if deprived of the diurnal cycle. Communication You will need to set up a special communications area within your refuge where you can house and use your radio equipment. In this \"radio shack\" you can install a telephone, intercom, amateur radio transc eiver, CB radio, weather alert radio, multi-band receiver, and/or scanning receiver, and monitor them on a twenty-four-hour basis. A special team of communica - tions people should be in charge of this equipment, and no one else should be allowed to fool with it.

There are several advantages to having an amateur radio operator as a member of your group. HAMs, as they are called, are radio hobbyists licensed to op erate very sophisticated equipment, some of which could b e vital to the success of your retreat. Although anyo ne can buy a 40-channel CB radio and operate it over a ran ge of three or four miles, a HAM can set up a local commu nic- ations net using two-meter equipment, giving a work ing range over twenty miles and providing 800 channels to choose from. In addition, two-meter rigs are remark ably clear and interference free, qualities CB will neve r pos- sess. The typical two-meter handi-talkies are about half the size of a comparable CB unit and usually have m uch greater battery life. For longer range communication, HAMs routinely set up stations which reach around the world. It is n't unusual for a HAM to spend the evening chatting wit h a radio friend in New Zealand, Australia, or South Af rica. If you were a survivor of a nuclear war, it would b e helpful to be able to radio for medical advice or f or news from a country not involved in the war. Of course, HAMs are also quite capable of reaching radio opera - tors within the United States and Canada, too. If you don't happen to know an amateur radio hobbyist, look in the yellow pages for a store carr ying HAM equipment and ask the proprietor to put you in touch with the local club. In three or four months, you can be trained and get your own license. You will h ave to learn Morse code and some elementary theory, but th e investment of time is well worth it. If you can't afford a wide variety of sophisticated radio equipment, at least get a multi-band portable receiver so you can tune in emergency broadcasts in your area. I recommend the GE ten-band receiver (GE Model Number 7-2971 A). This radio is about the siz e of a lunchbox and receives AM, FM, CB, and short wave (6 to 21 MHz), as well as all public service, UHF, and weather frequencies. It operates on batteries or wa ll power. I have used mine intermittently for over a y ear, and the original batteries are still going strong. You may find when you take your portable radio into a basement or fallout shelter that it doesn't work. Reinforced concrete and earth are excellent barrier s to radio signals. Then you may find that the radio has no LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 134 "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"external antenna jack. What do you do then? If the radio has a whip antenna, you can rig an external antenna and clip it to the whip with some success, particularly with FM. Just take any kind of insulated wire, tie a roc k to one end, heave the rock up into a tree, and run the other end down to the shelter. Wrap the wire around the w hip antenna, and you are ready to go. Unfortunately, many portable AM radios have internal ferrite rod antennas which are not easy to reach. You can disassemble the radio and connect your antenna directly to the circuit board through a cap acitor if you know enough about electronics, but there are easier methods. One is to carefully coil ten or fif teen feet of the antenna around the outside of the radio (the rest of the antenna is outside in the tree as before). T he external coil has to be coaxial with the coil aroun d the ferrite rod in order to work, so a little experimen tation will be necessary. But the simplest solution is to tie the radio to a long pole and set it outside on the grou nd. You can get normal reception that way while listening f rom within the shelter. If you have equipped the shelte r with twelve-volt emergency electricity, you can prepare your- self with an automobile AM-FM radio and antenna. Se t up the antenna outside, hook up the radio in theshe lter, and you're all set. An especially useful kind of radio for survivalists , is a weather alert radio with an automatic alarm. The government maintains many emergency weather infor- mation stations around the country, and if you are near one you can arrange to be instantly advised of any tornado, flood, hurricane, or atomic attack. I reco m- mend the Electra Bearcat Alert BC W for retreat app lica- tions. This radio will run on alternating current o r batteries, is designed for use with a roof antenna, and automatically turns itself on in the event of an em er- gency broadcast. The Electra Bearcat costs about 70 dollars. The Midland 13907 is my second choice (at 40 dollars), but it doesn't measure up to the Bearcat in terms of battery life or sensitivity. 4 As for CB equipment, the golden rule is never to buy any unit that won't deliver the full five-watt maxi- mum power. Even the five-watt units are disappointi ng unless they are attached to large base station ante nnas; a handi-talkie rated at less than five watts will fre quently Radios of use to survivalists.

I tend to favor the Realistic 200 series of handi-talkies bec ause of their versatility and convenient shape. These are f ive- watt units which can be obtained with six crystal- controlled channels or forty synthesized channels, external antennas, rechargeable batteries, alternat ing current adapters, auto adaptors, external microphon es, earphones, and speakers. They can be operated on a low power setting to conserve batteries or to reduce th e chance of being overheard, and they fit nicely into a surplus thirty-round magazine pouch for carrying on a pistol belt. One caution, however. Of my five handi - talkies, all have had to be returned for warranty s ervice once. After that, they have operated very reliably. Be sure to \"burn the unit in\" well before the guarante e period is over. Amateur radio equipment should be Heathkit manufactured for our applications because of the advantage of having the kit building manuals and troubleshooting guides that come with the radios. 5 You can buy a black box off the shelf if you want to, b ut it's nice to have a full set of manuals that tell you ho w to troubleshoot and repair your radio in case somethin g goes wrong. My last technical note about radios has to do with EMP, the electromagnetic pulse generated by a nucle ar explosion, discussed in chapter 2. There is a very real possibility that the EMP from an explosion many, ma ny miles away could destroy your electronic equipment if you don't protect it. I have seen comments in civil defense literature to the effect that disconnecting anten- nas and power leads during the attack will protect the equipment and that small radios won't be affected, but my contacts in the defense electronics industry tel l me otherwise. If you want to protect your radio equipm ent from EMP, they say, you'll have to disconnect it an d store it inside a closed metal cabinet which has be en electrically grounded. Nothing else will do. My sug ges- tion would be to store a few handi-talkies and port able radios in a metal footlocker and solder a conductin g strap from the box to a water pipe. The radio room should be located in some part of the shelter that can be isolated from the general l iving/ sleeping area. The radios will have to be operating even when people need quiet for sleeping, and in the day time the radio operator may need quiet in order to hear faint signals. Having the communications center in a sepa rate room is best. With the exception of routine checks with the security team, all activity in the radio shack shou ld be logged, with detailed written notes of the time, ra dio frequency, and content of all messages in and out. It will be important to be able to follow the broadcasts of particular stations, and without written records, y ou will be unable to relocate many of them. During the phase when your group members are entering the refuge, it might be a good idea for th em to announce their arrival (probably over CB radio) bef ore driving in. Your communications officer will need t o monitor the pre-selected channel and let those arri ving (and the security team) know that they are expected . This will be your opportunity to prepare a receptio n for any unexpected cars which may be tailing them. Security Most retreaters are naturally inclined to consider security a very important aspect of all phases of e mer- gency planning. I was a little surprised to discove r that the official shelter management text, too, devotes a lot of space to the subject of securing the shelter aga inst unwanted outsiders. Once again, though, the officia l version quickly loses touch with reality. One of th e suggested ways to deal with outsiders was to exchan ge people from the shelter with people from outside to \"equalize\" their exposure to radiation. I suspect t hat once inside, no one would agree to being rotated ou t- side, and that the people outside would not agree t o wait quietly until they could be rotated inside. A retreat group of any size should have a well- organized security team. Typically, there is one me mber of each survivalist family who is security-consciou s to the point of having some skill with firearms. A sec urity team composed of one member of each family is a ver y democratic arrangement which leaves no one feeling left out or at the mercy of the people wearing the guns. If you can organize your team that way, it will be a good arrangement. What are the duties of the security team? Actually, they are quite varied. For one thing, the security team meets and guides incoming retreat members, directin g them to their quarters. The security team controls entrance to the shelter to be sure that everyone's expo- sure time to external radiation is properly logged and that incoming persons have been decontaminated. Food, water, and medical supplies should be constan tly, but inconspicuously, kept under guard. During sleep ing periods, one or two security team members patrol th e shelter and keep watch over the sleepers, on guard against ventilation failure or fire. The team also checks on patients while the medical personnel are asleep. As the group leader, you may be forced to call on the security team to deal with a destructive or dan gerous member of the group, someone whose refusal to abide by the rules endangers everyone's survival. Your ac tion in this case will have to depend on the seriousness of the offense. A very minor infringement of the rules whi ch occurs only once can probably be ignored. Repeated minor offenses might be solved by a quiet talk with the offender or the offender's family—social pressure c an usually bring people into line. For the hard cases, there is no other resort other LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 136"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"than arrest and confinement. Someone who insists on taking more than the allotted share of food or wate r and who cannot be reasoned with is threatening the surv ival of the group. Not only does this person deplete the survival stockpile, but the contention produced cre ates dissatisfaction and unrest. Arrest and confinement, placing the uncooperative individual under direct c on- trol, is the only thing you can do. Be sure that th e survival rationale of the arrest is clear to the gr oup. Why confinement? Consider your other alterna- tives: You can't throw the offender out into the fa llout because this individual is somebody's friend or rel ative. (He or she wouldn't be a member of your retreat gro up otherwise.) Even if the troublemaker is a stranger, it is a mistake to consider expulsion as a solution. As soo n as you exile someone, the members of the group who dis - agree with your leadership will start to think you might do it to them. There goes your authority and group morale in one blow. Other actions will have equally serious consequences to morale. Don't even think ab out physical punishment, boot-camp harassment, mock jury trials, orwithholdingsurvival supplies. Just l ock up the offender. When you let the troublemaker go agai n is up to you. The most important duty of the security team is to form the nucleus of your defense in case of an atta ck by outsiders. You have the option of admitting strange rs, of course, but if you decide not to allow anyone el se into the refuge, the responsibility of turning the suppl icants away will fall on the security team. The best appro ach will be to direct strangers to some other potential source of safety, such as the nearest town with a CD offic e. Many of the people who will arrive seeking help wil l really need only a minimum amount of advice, after which they will be able to save themselves. You may be able to prevent many desperate confrontations simpl y by having a few dozen sets of survival instructions ready to hand out to unprepared neighbors. If you tell th em how to help themselves, many people will go away an d leave you alone. If not, you can always fall back o n the techniques discussed in chapter 7. Medical Care The first duty of your medical personnel will be t o break out the medical supplies and familiarize them - selves with the kind, quantity, and location of the mate- rials at hand. They should also take a few moments to meet and briefly examine the arriving group members . Many incipient medical problems can be nipped in th e bud right there. You should set up a sick bay in an isolated corner of the shelter where the main part of your group will not be exposed to patients (and vice versa). There are ver y important reasons for this isolation, in addition t o the obvious benefit to the recuperating patients. For o ne thing, in a restricted environment such as a baseme nt or other typical fallout shelter, you will be in defin ite danger of an outbreak of respiratory disease. Peopl e with cold or flu symptoms must be isolated from the main group to slow down or prevent the spread of th ese diseases. You might have enough penicillin to treat one pneumonia victim, but without isolation you could w ind up with twenty. Then what would you do? Another reason to isolate patients has to do with the psychological effect on the healthy members of the group. If the members of your retreat group have be en exposed to fallout on their way to the refuge (or f ear that they have), the first person who vomits will terrif y every- one. Since it is natural for people to become sick when confined in an enclosed space with the smell of vom it, one incident can trigger a rash of vomiting. It is not far from that to a panic over imaginary radiation sickn ess. Segregating people who feel sick can help prevent t his. (Be sure everyone knows that radiation sickness is not contagious.) If you have group members who have been injured by direct weapons effects, especially severe burns, isolat- ing them from the rest of the group will help the g roup avoid the demoralizing shock of being constantly exposed to severely injured or disfigured patients. This is part of the reason for being a retreater in the first place—to avoid witnessing the human suffering that will be created by the attack. The leader's goal is to c alm and reassure the people in the group, not to horrify an d shock them. Isolate the badly injured. Once you have set up your sick bay, you will need a second medical area in which to examine and treat y our \"outpatients.\" If you have segregated the truly ill and injured, it doesn't make much sense to parade the healthy ones through the sick bay just to give them aspirins. You might think of this second area as an \"examination room.\" It will need good lighting and privacy. Your medical stores can be kept in this ar ea. The medical team should keep a detailed log of the condition, symptoms, and treatment of each patient, including a careful account of the medication issue d. This will help you describe the patient's condition if you have to radio for medical advice, and it will give the on-duty medical attendant a complete record of ever y- thing that has happened since the last shift began. Incid- entally, if you place the radio room next to the examination room, radio links to a remote doctor wi ll be made easier. What do you do if someone dies?The signs of death observed in the patient should be carefully describ ed in the medical log and witnessed, signed, and dated by the medical team, the group leader, and the next of kin of the deceased. The next of kin should receive the pe rsonal effects of the deceased, except for those which cou ld spread disease or which have been fouled or damaged by 137 WAKE ME WHEN ITS OVER"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the patient's condition. The body should be covered , wrapped in its own bedding, and stored out of sight . If placed in a cool location, the body will keep for a t least a day or two, until you have sufficient time to allow a brief burial expedition outside. The radiological defense team will have something to say about the timing and dur a- tion of any such foray. In most locations there wil l be very little problem in disposing of the dead. It will also be the responsibility of the medical t eam to supervise the general living conditions within t he shelter to prevent any possible threat to the healt h of the group. This means they will have the right to \"pres cribe\" such non-medical measures as baths, de-lousing trea t- ments, and changes in food preparation or storage methods if necessary. Any step the medical team can justify on the grounds of health relates directly t o the survival potential of the group. That includes maki ng Johnny wash behind his ears—and Johnny's father, to o, if necessary. One duty which could fall to your medical team is the grisly job of \"triage.\" If your retreat plans g o radi- cally astray, you may be faced with treating many b adly hurt group members. The medical personnel will have to decide who can be saved and will have to withhold t he priceless medication from those who cannot be helpe d. Their decision is final—but be ready to have the se curity team back them up. Some of the relatives won't be inclined to agree with the medics. Distribution of Food and Water The group leader will find that water will be one o f the greatest worries. Your people will be able to l ive without food for weeks, and without medical attenti on for possibly many years, but without water, your ad ven- ture will be over within a week. By far the best situation is to have access to a de ep well at your refuge. In that case, you can use all the water you want without imposing restrictions. If you have to rely on a limited supply, however, you will have to manage its use very carefully. Modern Americans use water like the ever-present resource it has always been to us; without strict rationing, your group could go through a six-month supply of drinking water in a w eek. If your supply is limited, you should institute a basic ration of one-half gallon of drinking water p er person per day, doled out in six servings of about ten ounces at snack and meal times. If water is in shor t supply, you can cut this ration down to one quart p er day, but only if conditions are ideal. This means t hat the temperature is comfortable, that there is little ph ysical exertion to be performed, and that the shelter diet is restricted to high carbohydrate foods. (Protein req uires water for digestion.) Don't cut the ration any furt her than one quart per day. Having people die of thirst before the water runs out is inexcusable. Make it clear to everyone that the medical team may prescribe water as a medicinal resource to pers ons performing hard physical labor or to members suffer ing from burns, injuries, or diarrhea. Be extremely car eful to see that the distribution of the water ration is meticu- lously fair otherwise, because if it is not, you wi ll soon have a tense situation on your hands. Everybody get s half a gallon a day. Period. Of course, if your resources will stand it, your management problems will be made less difficult if you double this ration. A gallon a day is plenty to dri nk and leaves some extra for shaving, sponge baths, and pe r- haps a minimum of laundering. You might offer group members the choice of a rigid allowance or a more flexible arrangement in which they may use water at their own rates—as long as they don't exceed the da ily limit. This approach allows individuals to \"save up \" extra water for personal uses, but it also requires that someone who is above reproach keep track of every- body's water allowance. For sanitary purposes it is desirable that members of the group have their own water cups, and that wa ter be poured into the cup, not the cup dipped into the water. Contaminated water from outside the shelter (from a stream, lake or swimming pool) should not be used for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth, but it is all right for utilitarian uses such as fallout decontamination, laundry, fire fighting, sanitation, and bathing. Ju st be sure that you strain it through cloth first to remo ve fallout grains. Remember that any water you devote to sanitation can first be used for washing dishes, cl othes, diapers, or people. It will be safe to drink fallou t con- taminated water after two or three weeks, but it wo uld still be best to treat it as described in chapter 5 first. Advice about the preparation and serving of food is probably the area in which official shelter managem ent policy is most noticeably lacking. Apparently, some bureaucrat discovered that if you starve people the y will need less water, go to the toilet less frequen tly, and be too weak to cause trouble. From this discovery sprang the crackers-and-candy 700-calorie-per-day shelter diet. If you have any sense, you won't foll ow this example. The preparation of food is probably the one area of shelter living which can be of the greatest aid to the group leader. By planning the retreat food stockpil e to consist mainly of foods which require much prepara- tion, you can keep people busy preparing, serving, and cleaning up after meals for four hours or more each day. Stocking your emergency larder with cans of heat-an d- serve spaghetti is okay, but stocking dry spaghetti noodles and packets of dry sauce ingredients will h elp you keep people busy during times when activity wil l be a blessing. Keep the concept in mind while you are planning. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 138"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"As is the case with water, food should be distribut ed with absolute equality, except in the case of indiv iduals who clearly require more than their rightful shares . The medical team should have the authority to prescribe extra rations to their patients, pregnant women, la ctat- ing mothers, and persons who have been performing heavy labor on behalf of the group. (In some cases, teenaged boys might also be allowed a little extra to eat, too. They need it.) There is one potentially disastrous calamity which can arise from group meal preparation under surviva l conditions. If your refrigeration is not good (or i s non- existent), or if your cooking ware and eating utens ils are not kept scrupulously clean, you may develop food poisoning. The medical team will have to be on the alert for this possibility at all times, and it will be t heir duty to inspect all kitchen equipment before and after each meal. Also, the shelter leader should see to it tha t at least one member of the medical team eats a selection of food that is completely different from the main menu at each meal. If the rest of you suddenly get sick, there w ill be at least one medic available. Morale will be better if the food has variety and i s not too unfamiliar. Small children are notorious fo r refusing novel food, and under tense circumstances even adults may lose their appetites—when confronted wit h whole wheat gruel, to name an example. There will b e a natural tendency to eat the \"good\" food first and l eave the bulk of the stockpile for later—when the monoto ny of canned carrots meal after meal will be unbearabl e. See that it doesn't happen. Sleeping The amount of time you allow for sleeping may have to vary somewhat for the first few days. At fi rst, the members of your group will be feeling anxious and uncomfortable, and if they cannot sleep during the first or second night, you may be inclined to schedule te n hours of sleeping time later on to make up for what was lost. Be flexible. As a well-prepared retreat group, you ought to have separate sleeping quarters for each family group to pre- serve privacy. If you are forced by circumstances t o resort to community sleeping, your problems will be greatly increased. If you can't supply separate, en closed sleeping areas for each family, at least screen off three areas to separate unmarried males, unmarried female s, and family groups. Group morale will require some s uch arrangement. As for equipment, every individual should have a complete set of sleeping gear (mattress, blanket, p illow, sleeping bag, etc.). There should be several extra sets, too, to provide changes of bedding for sick persons and small children. If the group will have to spend an extended amount of time living in a crowded shelter, it may be wise to allow an outlet for sexual needs and other activities req uiring privacy. A \"private area\" out of sight (and sound) of the main group is an adequate solution. Just be sure th ere is somewhere people can go to be absolutely alone if t hey really feel the need. During the hours allotted for sleep, the members of your group should be strongly encouraged to respect one another's rights to quiet and darkness. Some fa irly specific rules might be needed to define these righ ts, and the security team night patrol should quietly enfor ce them. Remember that the idea here is to give everyb ody the best possible chance to get a good night's slee p; this goal can be jeopardized by both over-enforcing and under-enforcing the rules. One thing to think about in your preparation of the refuge is the fact that large utility storage shelv es can be used to store supplies before the emergency, and ca n be quickly converted to bunk beds after occupancy begi ns. With a little ingenuity your storage shelves can be designed to double as Pullman berths, giving a meas ure of privacy to the sleepers and a place they can thi nk of as their own. This also saves floor space. If you do use bunk beds, be careful to check the radiation dose of the upper bunks. You may have to put everybody on the floor for the first day or two unt il it becomes safe to sleep that close to the ceiling of the shelter. (See figure 16 for an illustration of radi ation levels in several basement areas.) Training The suggested shelter schedule advises that several time periods during the day be devoted to \"training .\" What does this mean? Persons in a retreat group about to emerge into the realities of a post-nuclear-war era will need to be taught how to survive in the new circumstances they will encounter. A well-prepared retreat group will assig n a team of qualified people to lead training sessions in which the specialists systematically educate the re st of the group members in the skills they will need to e xist, cope, and survive in their new way of life. A training program also gives people something to do. Teachers will spend some of their off-duty time framing their lesson plans, and trainees will spend time discussing and reviewing after each class. Even if there is no actual benefit derived from the content of the c lasses, the activity produced is worth the effort. At first, training should concentrate on two topics . The first is life within the shelter or refuge. Wha t are the rules? What is the routine? Where are certain featu res of the shelter located? How do you operate a chemical toilet? How do you start the generator? How do you use a Coleman stove? A two-way radio? A survey meter? The second topic concerns the real world effects of 139 WAKE ME WHEN ITS OVER"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"nuclear weapons. It will be important to advise the trainees about the factual implications of a nuclea r war to dispel some of their fears. You might simply rea d out loud a few excerpts from chapter 2, chapter 4, and Appendix E of this book. Don't let your people sit and worry about the pseudo-dangers they have seen in th e movies. That would certainly be damaging to morale. Another important topic to cover immediately is firearms safety. If you intend to have a \"ready rac k\" of loaded rifles and shotguns for defense, you will ne ed to drill everyone in the fundamentals of gun safety. I deally, a retreat group would consist entirely of skilled N ational Rifle Association members who have been handling weapons since they were pre-schoolers, but in real life you can expect that half of your group will be inco mpe- tent with guns. You must train them at least well e nough to make it safe to leave guns and novices alone in the same room. (This is particularly true of children a nd pacifists.) Later on, the emphasis in training can be shifted t o the skills the trainees will need in order to survi ve out- side the shelter. If you intend to live by farming and hunting, you will have to educate your people in th e theory and skills they will need in order to \"retur n to the land.\" Be sure that you teach at least a few people the more technical details (such as genetic breeding) i n case your resident farmer has a fatal accident. You will also want to select a certain number of hunters and star t teaching them the rudiments of good marksmanship using pellet guns. Lastly, the education of children must go on. They must be taught to read at the very least; without t he skill of reading, they will be unable to consult your tec hnical library, notes, and medical manuals after you are g one. If your group is planning for long-term self-suffic iency, at least buy a set of phonic reading books, phonic flash- cards, and an illustrated dictionary. You won't reg ret the expense. Recreation and Special Activities The official shelter management text makes life in a crowded fallout shelter sound like summer camp. Gro up reading, group singing, story telling, macrame, pos ter painting, mobile making .... A well-prepared retrea t group can do a lot better. You may already have thought of a reading library as a way to pass the time, and under the right circ um- stances a large selection of paperbacks could be a defi- nite survival resource both for individual and grou p reading. Don't forget, however, that only about 10 per- cent of the American public reads for recreation. T here may be people in your group whose eyesight is too p oor for them to enjoy reading. Others may be too young to be able to read. Still others may just not like to read. You will need other forms of recreation for such people . If your group has made careful preparations ahead of time, it should be possible for you to provide a wide variety of recreational resources. If you have a ge nera- tor, you can use any kind of electronic entertainme nt you happen to like. An electronic television game ( ping- pong, target shoot, tank battles, etc.) will keep c hildren busy for hours. A videotape recorder/player and fif ty cassettes of movies would be a tremendous recreatio nal resource. One two-hour escapist-type movie each eve n- ing will make your days pass much more quickly. Jus t be sure that you exclude nuclear war horror stories fr om your tape library. Recorded music can be a great morale booster if you use it correctly. Singing along with Mitch is o ut of vogue right now, but the sense of solidarity produc ed by group singing should not be overlooked. For whateve r reason, it is a fact that group singing creates a s pirit of unity that is difficult to produce any other way. H aving a few musical instruments laid away is also a good id ea. The wrong way to use music is to \"pipe it in\" constantly, giving your shelter the air of a dentis t's office. About half the people in your group will lo ve it, but the other half will go crazy. Conflicts in tast e can escalate to serious tensions if you aren't watching for them. You will also find that a major source of recreatio n will be provided by the communications equipment. People will be unable to resist fiddling with the s hort- wave receiver in search of news from the outside wo rld. You should purchase at least one portable shortwave radio that anyone in the group can use. Remember th at you will have to restrict access to the radio shack to prevent potential accidents with the radio equipmen t. Active games and exercise will help relieve some tension in the shelter, but you can only allow them if the ventilation team thinks it can handle the extra hea t and humidity that will result. A week or two of inactiv ity will not hurt anybody, but if you intend to become hunte rs and farmers during the post-war period, you might f eel the need for physical training. Have the medical te am supervise the exercise sessions, and don't let the \"coach\" coerce or cajole the flabby people. Members should be encouraged to progress at their own speed, with the medical team keeping a sharp lookout for signs of o ver- exertion or heart disease. The signs to watch for a re pulse rates greatly in excess of 160 beats per minu te during active exercise and/ or pulse failing to ret urn to normal within about five minutes. You may find that some of the survival training sessions will quickly become recreational in nature . After you have begun to use a BB gun to teach marks - manship, you may find that it will also be in servi ce during free-time periods. The toil of preparing mea ls may, if handled correctly, soon become a challenge to some of your group members. Your cooks may soon LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 140"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"make it a point of pride to serve \"impossible\" food s such as doughnuts, cakes, meatloaf, and chops made of whole wheat flour, sugar, milk, and dried soup mixe s. It can be done. Religious services also fall into the category of \"special activities.\" The religious behavior of you r group is something you should take into account in advanc e. Unless you are all members of the same church, you will have to handle your religious differences with some tact. Non-denominational services or prayers (at mealtime , for example) can usually be accommodated without offending anyone, particularly if the duty is rotat ed among the different factions represented in the gro up. Services characteristic of a particular religion wo uld be better conducted in private if that can be arranged . Don't make the mistake of thinking that just because your group happens to be composed of atheis ts, agnostics and Sunday golfers that you will not need a Bible and prayer book. You may find that your group will feel an overwhelming need for the \"proper\" ser vices if you have a death, or later on, a wedding. Management after Emergence At some point, the outside radiation will decay enough that group members will be able to safely le ave the shelter for longer and longer periods each day. This is the period of \"temporary emergence,\" when life w ithin the shelter will be varied by brief trips outside. Living conditions will remain essentially the same, except that you may have access to abundant water from outside for laundry and bathing. Your primary and most difficul t duty during this period will be to keep track of ea ch individual's daily radiation exposure and to preven t overanxious group members from trying to leave the shelter too soon. You will also want to have the ra dio- logical defense team begin a detailed survey of loc al radiation levels on and around your property. You m ay find that there will be both \"hot spots\" and \"cold spots,\" depending on where the fallout lodged when it fell. During this period of marginal safety, unsuspected hot spots could be very dangerous. At this point, a peculiarity of radiation dose rate measurement must be considered. Dose rate is suppos ed to be measured at a height of thirty-six inches abo ve the ground to give a \"proper\" reading. The reason for t his is that radiation exposure from fallout particles on t he ground diminishes rapidly with distance. Your feet get a much higher dose than your head as you walk across a contaminated area. Taking the measurement at a leve l of thirty-six inches gives you an average rate of e xposure for an adult male. The body of an adult female is a little closer to the ground and receives 1.2 times the sta ndard dose. That's not too alarming, but the picture chan ges rapidly as you get nearer the ground. A toddler thr ee feet tall receives four times as much radiation as his o r her father, even when they are standing side by side. A nd a crawling infant is exposed to sixty-four times the adult dose. Clearly, a dose rate measurement for each individ- ual should be taken at that person's midbody level. If the dose rate is barely safe for adults, don't expose c hildren to it. If you must take them across such a contamin ated area, you should carry them—a toddler sitting on an adult's shoulders receives only one-fourth of the s tand- ard adult dose. One more thing—don't lie down out there. If you wait until the standard dose measurement reads 0.25 R per hour (the level which a person can tolerate ind efi- nitely in a nuclear war context), you'll expect to receive only 6 R of exposure each day. But if, glad to be o ut of the shelter, you spread out your sleeping bag on co ntam- inated ground and spend the night, you'll expose yo ur- self to 128 R before morning. Four nights spent on the radioactive ground would certainly kill you, even though the survey meter (at thirty-six inches above the ground) says it's safe. During this period you may want to keep your primary security team inside the shelter as much as possible. Their inclination will be to get out ther e and \"patrol the perimeter,\" but it would be better to r estrain them and send second-string defenders to be the loo k- outs. You must shield your best fighters from radia tion exposure as a general policy because (1) you don't want to take any chances that they will develop radiatio n sickness, and (2) if worst comes to worst, they may have to expose themselves to outside radiation for dange r- ously long periods. Every hour you protect them dur ing this period will be another hour that they will be able to safely spend outside in an emergency. The time will eventually come when the radiation dose rate has fallen below 6 R per day. At that poi nt, it will be possible to leave the shelter for as long a s neces- sary, or even permanently, if you wish. It will be wise to at least sleep in the shelter, but you will be able to spread out to more roomy ground-level quarters in the dayt ime. This expansion into additional living space will si mplify problems of privacy and overcrowding. After permanent emergence, you will need to reor- ganize your teams and prepare to meet the new chal- lenges of life outside. Your approach to post-war l iving will depend largely on your circumstances and on th e preparations you have made in advance. Most full- fledged retreaters envision a future of complete se lf- sufficiency based on gardens, gathering, hunting, fishing, farming, and perhaps ranching. If this is your proposed course, you and your group will have to ma ke some hard decisions about how it is to be done. 141 WAKE ME WHEN IPS OVER"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Shelter living is, by its very nature, a socialisti c process. The survival of the group is the goal, and if your neighbor doesn't survive, then neither will you. Se lf- sufficient living, however, usually works best as a free enterprise activity. If you don't grow your own foo d, you don't eat. Trying to mix the two systems can be tricky, especially when the people who have to swea t in the sun all day plowing the fields start to feel bi tter about the easy life the hunters are leading. (Remember Ca in and Abel?) When your group is on its feet and you are all livi ng out in the open again, it will be inevitable that y ou will have dealings with other surviving groups in your a rea, including refugee groups and local residents. As a retreat group, you will be better equipped for the shift to self-sufficient living than most of your neighbors. It will be in your and their best interests if you make imm ediate attempts to offer your knowledge and skills to the local government as a gesture of community support. Remember that although you cannot share your food and supplies without jeopardizing your own long-ter m survival, you can share your knowledge of survival skills without endangering your position. The best possibl e way to avoid being attacked by starving neighbors i s to see to it that they don't starve. Teach them. Finally, you should be prepared for one staggering responsibility. When you attempt to contact the loc al government to offer your services, you may discover that, for all practical purposes, you are the local govern- ment. It could happen. As a large group of organize d and well-trained survivalists in the midst of starv ing anarchy, you may be sucked into a power vacuum. If so, you will find that your security team has become th e core of the local police department, your medical t eam has suddenly become the health department, and your food-and-water team has assumed the duties of count y agents. The radiological defense team may be guidin g decontamination efforts; your communications people may be setting up telephone, telegraph, or radio li nks to surrounding homesteads and communities; your train- ing staff may be badly overworked teaching survival skills; and you, poor benighted soul, will be wonde ring how buying a few bags of wheat and a shotgun could have catapulted you into such a mess. Good luck. Commentary This is the final chapter of Life After Doomsday, and before closing I would like to discuss two subj ects which didn't quite fit anywhere else in the book. T he first is what I call the Leibowitz project; the second is the problem of finding a solution to the arms race. There is a recurrent theme in survival fiction in which someone carefully selects and preserves an as sort- ment of books intended to help civilization rebuild after the disaster. This theme appears in A Canticle for Leibo- witz, 7 Lucifer's Hammer, 8 and The Time Machine, 9 to name only three examples. It is also an importan t theme in medieval history. We are familiar with the ancient Greek and Roman classics only because the books were deliberately preserved through the Dark Ages by monks and others who recognized their worth . The Leibowitz. project is my informal attempt to se e that the knowledge essential to civilization's reco very aftera nuclearwar will be available when it is need ed. To this end I propose that you select three books as a legacy for the future. The first two books should be a ref erence book and a textbook relating to your profession; th at way you can pass on the knowledge of the field you know best. The third book might be anything. It cou ld be a book about history, art, religion, science, po etry, philosophy, or even fiction. When you have selected your three books, buy a new hardback copy of each. LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 142 Treat each book with insecticide, wrap it in severa l layers of plastic and foil, and seal it airtight. L abel the package well. Then store it in a safe place. Maybe, someday, we'll all be glad you did. As for the arms race, I find each of the three typi cal \"solutions\" to be unacceptable. I think waiting pas sively to see what happens is suicidal; unfortunately it i s a very common policy. As far as I can see, the result of d isarm- ing ourselves to avoid the war would be eventual ca pitu- lation. In my opinion, people who believe otherwise are being idealistic to the point of mental incompetenc e. The only other \"solution\" I have encountered is the Russian one: Get ready to fight the war and win it. That is a chilling alternative, and if we eventually dec ide to pursue it, decades will pass before we catch up to our opponents. A fourth alternative, of course, is the one repres- ented by this book; but I retain the hope that ther e must be some solution other than preparing for the worst . We must continue to seek another way out of the nuclea r arms race, and not simply sit back on our supplies and watch the world drift gradually toward nuclear war. Having read Life After Doomsday, you are aware that personal survival of a nuclear attack is quite poss ible— but it requires a lot of effort. If you are willing to expend the effort getting ready for the war, why not make an"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"effort to help prevent or avoid the war, too? Somew here there must be a feasible course of action lying bet ween the unacceptable alternatives of decimation and capitul a- tion. A contribution of yours might help find it. The largest single obstacle to finding such a solu- tion is the fact that most Americans are abysmally ignor- ant about nuclear weapons. After reading this book, you no longer fall into that category. You could make a substantial contribution to the nuclear arms questi on by using your knowledge to educate your friends. The n ext time you hear people repeating the \"no survivors\" 10 myth, challenge them. Do they really know anything about the effects of nuclear weapons'? About fallou t? About radiation protection? How about the size and structure of the Soviet and American arsenals? Are they aware of the variety of ways in which such a war mi ght get started? Do they know the truth about the long- term effects of radiation exposure, or do they rely on n uclear superstitions? Do they have a realistic grasp of th e number and distribution of nuclear targets in their area? What about ecological effects? You will find that m ost people are almost totally ignorant of even the most fundamental realities of nuclear war. You can help cor- rect that. I spent over a year writing this book to educate yo u about these topics. Do me the courtesy of spending ten minutes passing on some of the information to a fri end. It will be time well spent.

Jim McKeever has called my attention to an article in the MISL about the benefits of storing frozen food in a fallout shelter. The idea is that a small freezer filled with pre-cooked food, medicines, and flashlight batteries simplifies some of the problems of shelter living. Even without electricity, the food will take three or fo ur days to thaw if the freezer is kept shut. Keep in mind, however, that some medicines can't su ccessfully be frozen. Dry tablets, particularly, should not be frozen. (See table 14 i n this regard.) 7. Walter M. Miller, Jr., A Canticle for Leibowitz. Bant am, 1961. 8.

All of the data were in the op en literature; there are no government secrets revealed here. The primary source was High Risk Areas for Civil Preparedness N uclear Defense Planning Purposes (DCPA, TR-82, April 1975) . All high priority targets were double-checked against A nalysis of Effects of Limited Nuclear Warfare (United States S enate Committee on Foreign Relations, September 1975). Figure 35 shows the extent of areas of direct weapo n effects in which an unprotected human would be in d anger of injury. However, 300 tertiary targets not shown on this map are discussed in the text. Do not overlook these ta rgets in your survival planning. In the list that follows, the ra dius of danger is assumed to be ten miles unless the target is mar ked with an asterisk (*). In that case, the danger radius is tw enty miles. Note that some danger areas cross state boundaries. , Primary targets are military bases, missile silos , and com- mand posts which the Soviets may attack without war ning in an effort to disarm us. These areas will certainly be hit in any nuclear exchange. Persons living near these targets will receive virtually no warning before the incoming warheads e xplode. Secondary targets are military installations and ci ties which have high military value but which do not hou se stra- tegic weapons. These areas might not be attacked in a first strike, but would be reserved for subsequent bomber or missile attacks with the object of reducing our ability to fight a pro- longed conventional war. Tertiary targets are non-military cities whose resi dents can be held hostage for purposes of nuclear blackma il. The object here would be to destroy cities one by one i n every state until Congress was clamoring for peace at any price. If this course of action sounds unthinkable, remember that it is exactly what we did to the Japanese at the end of W orld War II. The High Risk Areas manual designates 175 counties which could receive extremely high levels of fallou t radiation. I have chosen not to reproduce this list here because , in my opinion, the information is very poor. The DCPA res earchers made assumptions and used statistical techniques wh ich have very little to do with reality; problems were compo unded by inappropriate graphics and slopping printing practi ces. The results are misleading and potentially dangerous fr om the standpoint of survival planning. The fallout predic tion method described in chapter 3 is much more reliable .

LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 152"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"APPENDIX C Expedient Shelter Construction The following shelter-building instructions were ad apted from Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Expedient Shelter Ha nd- book (ORNL-4941), a manual written by G. A. Christy a nd Cresson Kearny. The Door-over-Trench shelter (figure 36) can be used by just about everyone; the Car-over-Trench shelter (figures 37, 38, and 39) is particularly appropriat e to retreaters who plan to drive to a remote refuge in an emergenc y. Several other shelter plans were presented in this manual w hich I would have liked to include here, but space did not allow this. The instructions for constructing these two shelter s are basically so similar that 1 have taken the liberty of combining them into a single set of instructions. Each paragr aph is pre- ceded by a notation (CAR, DOOR, or BOTH) indicating to which shelter the instructions apply. Before startin g, be sure to line out the paragraphs which do not apply to the s helter you wish to build. Study all the instructions carefully before begin- ning work, and then check off each step as you fini sh it. Both types of shelter are intended for use in areas where a shortage of building materials exists and where the earth is sufficiently firm that the walls of the shelter wil l not cave in. A Car-over-Trench Shelter will provide fallout protect ion for four to six people, depending on the size of the ca r. A Door- over-Trench Shelter will provide fallout protection for one adult or older child for each door used and provide s better fallout, blast, and fire protection than does a Car- over-Trench Shelter. A family evacuating a probable target area during a crisis can carry with them—provided they have a car with a roof rack, a station wagon, or a pickup truck—enoug h doors with the knobs removed to build this shelter. For either shelter, first determine whether the gro und is firm enough to be safe. If the earth is very sandy, it is unlikely to be stable enough to keep the trench sidewalls fr om caving in. A quick test to determine whether or not earth is f irm enough is given in step 7. Also before beginning, you shou ld dig a test hole to make sure that the ground water table and t he depth to solid rock is more than forty inches below the surf ace. 1. DOOR—Materials Required: One door for each adult, older child, or two younger children to be sheltere d is neces- sary. Even hollow-core interior doors will serve. In addition to digging tools—preferably pick and shovel—the following rainproofing materials are req uired: (A) To make the buried roof, especially needed to k eep rain or melting snow from dangerously weakening the eart h- covered doors, at least twenty-five square feet per person of waterproof material such as canvas, plastic sheetin g (four or more mils thick), shower curtain, or plastic tablec loth is needed. A family-sized tent might even be used. (B) For the two canopies over the shelter openings, a piece of rainproof material about six by six feet and a second piece a bout four by four feet are required. These canopies will keep fallout and/or rain from entering the shelter. Ordinary clo th will keep out fallout particles but not rain. Other materials are also useful: (A) An additional fifty square feet (about the area of a bedsheet) per pers on of plastic or cloth is needed to line the trench and t o make \"rolls\" to raise and strengthen the entryway and ve ntilation hole openings (see figure 40). Plastic bedsheets, b edspreads, stout curtains, canvas, rugs, etc. will serve. (B) T wo pillow- cases per person, filled two-thirds with earth, wil l function as \"sandbags.\" (C) String and/or cord, a knife, and a file for sharpening tools, as well as a measuring tape, yard stick, or ruler, will be indispensable. (D) Finally, four sti cks or boards (each about four feet long) and eight stakes to sup- port the awnings over the shelter openings are requ ired. Poles and stakes from the family tent will work wel l. 2. CAR—Materials Required: In addition to digging too ls— preferably pick and shovel—a car that can be parked over the trench is required. A four-wheel-drive pickup t ruck is ideal, but any car more than nine feet long will se rve. The following materials are also needed: (A) To keep ea rth mounded around the car from falling into the trench and to provide a storage shelf on the surface around the t rench, plastic sheeting (such as polyethylene film at leas t four mils thick, shower curtain, or plastic tablecloth) or cl oth (bed- sheets, bedspreads, etc.) are needed. (Ten to twelv e bed- sheets or the equivalent area of material will be r equired.) (B) Eight pillowcases, filled two-thirds with earth, will func- tion as \"sandbags.\" (C) String and/ or cord, a knife , and a file for sharpening tools as well as a measuring ta pe, yard- stick, or ruler will be indispensable. 3. BOTH: If at all possible, wear gloves while building the shelter (including digging test holes) to avoid bli sters. In this context, blisters could be fatal. 4. BOTH: Sharpen all tools before beginning work, and k eep them sharp. 5. BOTH: Select reasonably level ground, accessible by car. 6. BOTH: Make sure that the earth is firm and stable en ough so that the walls of the trench will not cave in. A s a test, dig a small hole about eighteen inches deep. Remove all lo ose earth from the bottom of the hole. Then make a \"thu mb test\" by pushing a bare thumb into the undisturbed earth in the bottom of the hole. If the thumb can be pushed into the earth no further than one inch, the earth should be suitable for this type of shelter. If the earth does not pas s the \"thumb test,\" move to another location and try the test ag ain. Con- tinue to relocate and repeat until suitable earth i s found. To make doubly sure the earth is sufficiently stabl e and safe, make \"heel tests\" as the trench is deepened. To make a \"heel test,\" first make an undisturbed, smooth eart h step at least four inches wide, sixteen inches long, eighte en inches below the surface, and eight inches above whatever depth you have dug the trench. If the earth step does not break off when a 150-lb man stands on the outermost four inch es of this step, placing all of his weight on one heel wh ile raising his toe slightly, then the earth is stable enough t o safely dig a vertical-walled trench at least eight inches deeper than this earth step (see figure 41). 153 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" FIGURE 36: Building plans for the Door-over-Trench expedient fallout shelter.

To determin e the length of the trench, add together the widths of al l the doors to be used for roofing it, and then subtract eight inches from this sum. (To avoid arithmetical errors, it is best to lay all the doors side by side on the ground.) 8. Stakeout a rectangular trench thirty-six inches wid e and of the length previously determined. Also stake out th e en- trance at one end and the ventilation hole at the o ther. 9. CAR: Dig a trench twenty-eight inches wide and f orty inches deep. To determine the length of the trench, measure the overall length of the car (front to rear bumper ). Subtract forty-eight inches from this measurement and use th is dimension as the length of the trench. 10. CAR: Stake out a rectangular trench twenty-eight in ches wide and of the length determined previously. Also stake out the entrance 11. BOTH: Clear any brush, grass, or weeds that are mor e than a few inches high from the area where the tren ch will be dug, and from the ground around all sides of the tr ench to a distance of about eight feet from the sides and end s of the trench. 12. BOTH: Dig the main trench, the entryway trench, and the ventilation-hole trench. Place the excavated earth along both lengthwise sides of the trench so that no eart h is piled nearer than three feet from the sides. 13. BOTH: To reduce the labor in removing hard earth wi th a pick, pick-mattock, or grubbing hoe: (A) Keep tools sharp. (B) After shoveling out and leveling the temporary bottom of the trench, start picking in the center of the t rench, digging and then shoveling out a shallow hole acros s the entire width of the trench. (C) Then with the pick or mat- tock, break off row after row of small chunks of ea rth, breaking off each row across the width of the trenc h. A little experimentation may be necessary to determine the o pti- mum size chunk which will break off with each pick stroke. Move forward as the work progresses (see figure 42) . (D) Shovel out the loose earth until the trench flo or is again about level. (E) Repeat. 14. DOOR: To keep each trench its full width as it is d ug, cut sticks thirty-six, eighteen, and twelve inches long , and use them repeatedly as width measures. Keeping the tren ch its full width will save much work and time later. 15. CAR: Excavate both the main trench and the twenty-f our- inch-long part of the entryway trench to a depth of forty inches. To save work, cut a stick twenty-eight inch es long and use it repeatedly to help keep the main trench its full twenty-eight inches wide as it is dug down. To keep out radiation, do not make the entrance larger than ill ustrated unless a very large person must enter. 16. BOTH: If thes oil changes as the trench is being ex cavated, again make the same two soil tests—the \"thumb test\" and the \"heel test\"—used in the test hole. If the soil does not pass the tests, do not dig the trench any deeper. 17. DOOR: Carefully level and smooth the ground to a di s- tance of two and one-half feet from the sides of th e trench so that the doors will lie flat on the ground. 18. BOTH: If the supply of sheets, bedspreads, plastic, and/or other materials is plentiful, line the walls before covering the trench. The wall lining should reach the floor of t he trench. A trench with lined walls is more livable; the lini ng keeps the dirt from falling into eyes. Remove loose earth and rock from the edges and walls before placing the lining. H ang the lining from the edge of the trench by piling a litt le earth on it. 19. DOOR: To rainproof the shelter and to prevent t he roof- ing doors from being dampened and weakened, use ava ila- ble waterproof materials as follows: If the earth i s dry, the easiest and best way to make a rainproof roof is to place the doors directly on the ground, with each of the end doors overlapping an end of the main trench by four inche s. Be sure to first level the ground surface so that door s touch the ground close to all edges of the trench. Mound dry earth over the doors until the mound is about twelve inch es deep above the centerline of the trench and slopes to bo th sides, just covering the ends of the doors. Next, smooth o ff the earth mound, being careful to remove sharp stones a nd sticks that might puncture the rainproof material. Then place waterproof material over the smooth mound, ma king the illustrated \"buried roof.\" Finally, carefully m ound an additional six to twelve inches of earth on top of this roof. If the earth is wet, place the waterproof material directly on top of the doors to keep them dry and s trong. To keep water from collecting on the horizontal surfac e and leaking through, slope the doors toward one side of the trench by raising the other side of the trench by a bout three inches. One way to raise a side (while not increasi ng the distance the doors must span and thus decreasing th e depth of earth that they will support) is to place an ear th-filled \"roll\" of bedsheets or other material along one lon g edge of the trench. To keep the waterproof material used to cover the doors from sliding down the slope of the doors when earth is shoveled on, tuck the upper edge of the ma terial under the higher ends of the doors. Finally, mound earth over the doors so that the mound is eighteen inches deep above the centerline of the roof and three or four inches deep over both ends of the doors. If more waterproof material is available than is required to create a \"buried roof,\" to cover the do ors, and to make the two illustrated canopies over the shelter openings, use this excess material to cover the ground on whi ch the doors are placed. 20. DOOR: In order to be able to place an adequately th ick depth of shielding earth right up to and around the entryway and ventilation hole, before placing the earth cove r on the roof, stack improvised \"sandbags\" around these two open- ings, or use cloth or plastic material to make \"rol ls\" of earth, as illustrated in figure 40. 21. DOOR: Shovel earth around the \"rolls\" or \"sandbags, \" used to raise the level of the earth around the two shelter openings. Slope this earth outward, and pack it so that rain water on the ground cannot run into the shelter. 22. CAR: After the trench has been dug and cleaned out to a depth of forty inches, or the excavation stopped be cause the soil has changed, drive the car carefully over the trench. Have someone guide the driver carefully. 23. CAR: To shield against radiation coming from above the trench shelter, remove the seats and put excavated earth into the car (on the front and rear floor, on the areas where the seats were, and inside the trunk) to an average dep th of at least one foot. If you are using a pickup truck, fi ll the bed to a depth of one foot, too. 24.

LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 158 "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"from falling into the trench, use plastic sheets at least four mils thick, shower curtains, bed sheets, or other material—as illustrated in figures 37, 38, and 39. To do so, first fold a sheet about fifteen inches from one of its long edges. Then secure the folded edge of the sheet in the bottom of the door frame by closing the door on it. Place the longer part of the sheet on the gro'und in such a position that the line along which the cloth contacts the ground surf ace, when the cloth is pushed inward toward the trench, is an inch or two inside the line joining the inner sides of the front and rear wheels. Next, put some earth on the larger par t of the sheet to hold it in place on the ground. 25. CAR: Shovel more earth on and against this held-in- position, larger part of the sheet, up to the heigh t of the bottom of the car door. Meanwhile, keep the fifteen -inch- wide outer flap of the sheet above the banked earth until it can be placed on the outward-sloping side of the ba nked earth. So placed, this flap will help carry away fr om the shelter any rain or fallout that may run off the ca r. For added shielding, bank earth twenty inches high arou nd the car. 26. CAR: Secure the folded material in the front door so that enough of it extends in front of the door to enable you to prop up this part of the fold under the front fende r. Water that may run off the car roof from its drain channe l then will not run under the car. Similarly, secure plastic or cloth sheets under the closed hood and car trunk to keep earth piled around the front and rear of the car from fal ling under the car. 27. BOTH: Dig small drainage ditches around the complete d shelter to lead runoff water away. 28. BOTH: To keep rain and/or sand-like fallout particle s from entering the shelter openings, build an open-s ided canopy over each opening as illustrated in figures 38 and 39. Support each canopy on two sticks placed firmly in the ground; pull the corners of each canopy with cords tied to the bases of four stakes. 29. BOTH: For a place to sit inside the shelter, make a \"bench\" of water and food containers, bedding, etc. , placed along the side of the trench that is farthest from the off- center shelter openings. If the trench floor is dam p, it is best to cover it with waterproof material. 30. CAR: Place \"sandbags\" on the ground around three side s of the entrance. (A pillowcase about two-thirds ful l of earth, tied closed at its mouth, makes a quite satisfactor y \"sand- bag.\") Mound earth around and almost as high as the sandbags to keep possible rainwater on the ground f rom running into the shelter trench. Study figure 40 cl osely in this regard. 31. CAR: To provide the essential ventilation—especially for enough cooling outdoor air in warm weather—build a venti- lation opening at the rear of the car. Make this op ening ten inches wide and at least six inches high. (This ope ning will need to be made larger if you plan to build a Kearn y air pump to use in it—see Appendix D for plans of the p ump.) 32. BOTH: In cold weather, restrict air flow through the shelter by hanging curtains or otherwise partially obstruct- ing the two shelter openings. Always leave at least a few square inches open in each opening, however, to pre vent a dangerous concentration of exhaled carbon dioxide. To keep exhaled water vapor from wetting clothing and bed- ding and reducing its insulating value, prop the ve ntilation openings as wide open as is practical to maintain t olerably warm shelter temperatures. When fallout is descendi ng, ventilation openings should of course be closed mor e tightly. 33. CAR: After otherwise completing the shelter, put six to eight inches of earth on top of the car hood to inc rease the shielding provided by the engine and to prevent the sun from overheating the hood and thus the air inside the sh elter. 34. CAR: To increase the radiation shielding of the entra nce at times when temperatures inside the shelter permi t most of the entrance to be closed, fill a car seat with ear th. A shelter occupant can then pull the upside-down, earth-fille d car seat over the entrance hole, as required. If the car lac ks a hollow seat, use an earth-covered spare tire, or boards. 159 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"APPENDIX D The Kearny Air Pump The Kearny Air Pump (KAP) is a ventilation pump des igned by Cresson H. Kearny at Oak Ridge National Laborator y to be used in expedient fallout shelters. It consists of a wooden frame about three feet square (the dimensions are v ariable) with a series of plastic flaps arranged across one face to allow air to pass through the frame in only one direction . When the frame is swung back and forth in a doorway or venti lation tunnel, the flaps act as valves, creating a flow of air. The formal instructions on how to build a KAP are lengthy, but this shortened version will provide a general overview o f principles and design. The frame can be made of any stiff material. Althou gh small boards are pictured, even a few relatively st raight sticks cut from bushes could be used. Note that the openin g of the pump is crossed by many wires spaced about two thir ds of an inch apart and that only every fifth or sixth wire carries a plastic flap. String pulled taut across the opening and stapled or tied in place can be used in place of wire. The flaps are cut from garbage bags or strong paper. A hem of flap ma terial is wrapped around a wire and taped to itself (not to t he wire). The drawings picture metal hinges being used to sus pend the KAP in the doorway; you might take a set of hinges from a door in your house. In more primitive conditions, a hinge made of rope, wire, or fabric tape might be made to serve. See figures 43, 44, 45, and 46 for details of construct ion. FIGURE 44: Detail of KAP construction.

This material has been condensed from The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, edit ed by Samuel Glasstone. Special Characteristics of Injuries Sudden compression and decompression of the body in the blast wave results in damage at junctions betwe en tissues and in air-containing organs. The lungs are particu larly prone to hemorrhage and edema, and if the injury is sever e air can enter the veins of the lungs, creating air embolic obstruction of the vessels of the heart and brain. Bodily activity in a person suffering primary blast injuries is extremely hazar dous for this reason, and can produce death where recovery might other- wise have occurred. Damage to the brain is unlikely as a direct effect, but can result from arterial air emboli ari sing in the lung. Persons who spontaneously survive twenty-four to forty- eight hours without treatment, complications, or ot her injuries usually recover, showing little lung hemorrhage aft er seven to ten days. Primary blast effects can cause temporary loss of c on- sciousness and ruptured eardrums. Indirect blast injuries from missiles striking the body can either be penetrating or nonpenetrating. Small glas s fragments can cause penetrating wounds deep enough to enter t he abdominal cavity in some cases, even if the fragmen ts are very small (0.1 grams). Indirect injuries caused by the body being thrown through the air and striking a stationary ob ject do not differ from normal impact injuries. Burns. Nuclear weapons produce flame burns, flash burns, and sometimes burns due to contact with hot gas and dust from the explosion itself. Flame burns are ide ntical to common burns caused by any fire. Flash burns are in flicted directly by the thermal heat pulse of the explosion and are usually restricted to those parts of the body not c overed by clothing. Only the side of the body facing the fire ball is injured. Flash burns through clothing usually occur where t he fabric is thin and tightly pressed to the skin, such as at t he elbows and shoulders. Flash burns generally show a much smaller depth of penetration of the skin than flame burns. Dependin g on the distance from the explosion, the burns may vary fro m mild erythema to charring of the skin. Flash burns devel op as depigmented lesions in cases of moderate exposure, but in cases of light exposure the initial erythema is fol lowed by the development of a walnut coloration of the skin. (No te: This remark applies directly only to Orientals.) Burns of moderate second degree (and milder) usually heal within four weeks, but third degree burns can easily be- come infected, especially because one of the effect s of nuclear radiation injury is to decrease the body's resistan ce to infec- tion. Infected second-degree burns can become third -degree burns due to the destruction of the remaining layer of skin. Thick scar tissue (keloids) can be expected over he aled burns if the healing is delayed by infection or mal nutrition. Dark-skinned people (Orientals) produce keloids eas ily as a racial characteristic. The keloids subside graduall y in the course of years. Eye injuries. Nuclear explosions produce chorioreti nal burns, flash blindness, and keratitis. Retinal spot burns occur in persons who have the fireball in their field of view at the instant of detonation. Impairment of visual acuity will depend on the part of the retina that is damaged. Flash blindness is a temporary condition of dazzlem ent which may persist from a few seconds to several day s. It is associated with image persistence, after-image form ation, halo, etc. Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) may appear i n nuclear explosion victims in some instances. The sy mptoms (sensitivity to light, foreign-body sensation, lach rymation, redness) last from a few hours to several days. The onset of most cases follows soon after the explosion, but de layed onset as much as a month later can occur when associated with nuclear radiation injury. Corneas usually do not suf fer per- manent damage in a nuclear flash injury of the eye (there is no delayed opacity). Effects of acute radiation dosages. The unit of rad iation dosage in normal use is the \"rem\" which stands for \"roentgen equivalent mammal (or man).\" The rem is a dose unit of \"biological effect\" and does not refer to the amoun t of radia- tion received but to the amount of damage done. For gamma rays, x-rays, and beta rays, the dose in rems is ap proximately equal to the amount of radiation received measured in roentgens. Table 19 represents a summary of the clinical effec ts of acute ionizing radiation dosages (those received al l at once or over a very short time). The information applies to whole- body exposures uncomplicated by other conditions. Radiation injuries superimposed on other conditions aggravate shock. An irradiated person with burn inj uries may develop earlier and more severe shock than the exte nt of the burns would indicate. Healing of wounds is retarded by the effects of radiation sickness due to a drop in natu ral resistance to secondary infections. Infections which would nor mally be dealt with by the body may prove fatal in radiation victims. Acute doses of 25 to 200 rems produce little effect . Some patients will complain of vague discomfort or fatig ue, others may have nausea and vomiting during the first day a fter exposure, and still others will show no symptoms at all. Detec- table blood changes will be present in some people (see figure 47). The patients will recover and feel fine for up to two weeks or more, then suffer mild loss of appetite and mala ise. In this latent period, changes in the character of the bloo d will be more definite. Essentially all patients will recove r completely 163 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" TABLE 19 Clinical Effects of Acute Ionizing Radiation Doses in the absence of other injuries or infection.

Acute doses of 200 to 1,000 rems will produce letha l effects in from 0 to 80 percent of the patients, de pending on the dose. Probability of survival is good at the lower end of the range and poor at the upper end. Initial symptoms d evelop generally within twenty-four hours of exposure and consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and m alaise. The larger the dose, the sooner the symptoms will devel op. Symp- toms will disappear after a day or two, and for sev eral days to two weeks the patient will feel relatively well. Su bsequently there is a return of symptoms, including fever, dia rrhea, and a step-like rise in temperature which may be due to a ccompany- ing infection. Commencing two to three weeks after e xposure, there is a tendency to bleed spontaneously, and sma ll hemor- rhages (petechiae) form under the skin. This tenden cy may be marked. Spontaneous bleeding from the lining of the mouth, the intestinal tract, and the kidneys (blood in the urine) are very common. The bleeding is due to a lack of plate lets in the blood. Epilation (loss of hair) begins at about two weeks in cases exposed to more than 300 rem. A loss of white blood cells occurs, leading to overwhelming infections. More se rious cases exhibit severe emaciation and delirium, with death inter- vening in two to eight weeks.

Symp- toms are hyperexcitability, ataxia (lack of muscula r coordina- tion), respiratory distress, and intermittent stupo r. There is almost immediate incapacitation, and death follows in all cases within a few hours to a week. Emergency Handling of Radiation Victims The following guidelines for handling radioactively con- taminated patients were adapted from Physician's Em ergency Handling of Radiation Accident Cases (Atomic Energy Com- mission, 1969—Y3.At7:2 Rl 1/20). Originally written with a nuclear power plant accident in mind, they have bee n adapted here for the nuclear war setting. 1. Check patient on stretcher for contamination, us ing a sur- vey meter. 2. If seriously injured, give emergency lifesaving ass istance immediately. 3. Handle contaminated patients as if carrying out a s urgical procedure (use cap, mask, gown, gloves, etc.). 4. Collect and contain all potentially contaminated ma terial, such as clothing, bedding, blood, urine, vomitus, a nd stool. When the patient is first removed from the contamin ated environment, any or all of these could be radioacti ve and must be treated accordingly. 5. Decontaminate the patient's skin by washing with so ap and warm water (as the medical condition permits). Pay particu- lar attention to body orifices, folds of skin, and hair. Con- tinue to use the survey meter to check the progress of the decontamination. Scrub the most contaminated parts first. 6. Wounds should be covered until the general decontam ina- tion bath is accomplished. Then they should be libe rally irrigated with sterile water, and the run-off caugh t in a basin. This water will now contain radioactive mate rial and must be handled with care. 7. In the case of a grossly contaminated wound contain ing fallout, dirt particles and crushed tissue, the eme rgency treatment is a simple wet debridement followed at a later date by more thorough surgical attention. The tissu e and dirt removed from the wound will be radioactive and will require proper handling.

Rate of Decay Calculations Figure 48 consists of two scales which you can cut apart and use as you would a slide rule. The upper scale shows various times after the nuclear explosion, ranging from one hour to forty days. The lower scale represents the radiation dose rate. By sliding the scales back and forth, yo u can match any measured dose rate with the time when it was me asured. This gives you a means of predicting how rapidly th e fallout radiation in your area will decay. Measure the radi ation close rate outside the shelter, exactly three feet above the ground. For example, the scales are positioned in figure 47 as if a measurement of 1,000 R per hour has been obtained a little less than three hours after the explosion. By comparing the scales to the right of this point, you can see that the do se rate will fall to 10 R per hour by the sixth day, and to 1 R per h our by the fortieth day. (You can cut the scales apart alongth edotted line and reposition them to fit your time and radiation reading.) Note that the dose rate scale is in arbitrary units , which means that you can adjust it also to suit your need s. The scale as printed runs from I to 1,000 R per hour. You can adjust it to cover the range from 10 to 10,000 R per hour by mul tiplying the numbers on the scale by 10. You can adjust it t o cover the range from 0.1 to 100 R per hour by dividing the nu mbers on the scale by 10. To cover the range from 0.01 to 10 R per hour divide the numbers on the scale by 100. Stay-time Calculations Suppose you have an emergency and you want to know how long you can stay outside without receiving a d angerous dose of radiation. Figures 49 and 50 will help. First, you must determine the dose rate for one hou r after the explosion (even if it took more than one hour f or the fall- out to reach your location). Using figure 49, draw a straight line from a measured dose rate in the left scale(Ex posure Rate at H+t) to the time when the dose rate was measured in the center scale (Time after Burst), and continue the l ine to inter- cept the right scale (Exposure Rate at H+l). The in tercept point on the right scale gives you the theoretical dose rate at one hour, which you need for the next calculation. Decide how much radiation you are willing to accept . This will depend on your previous exposure and how close you are to the 200 R lethal limit (see figure 50). Mark the maxi- mum allowable dose in the left-hand scale (Total Ex posure). Now mark the H+l dose rate in the scale second from the left (Exposure Rate—1 hour). Draw a line through these t wo points to intercept the center scale (E/ R 1). Mark the intercept point on the center scale. Finally, mark the \"entry time\" (when you plan to go outside) on the right-hand scale. Now draw a straig ht line from the point on the center scale to the point on the r ight-hand scale. This line will cross the \"Stay Time\" scale. The intercept point will be the amount of time you can stay outsi de before acquiring your maximum safe dose of radiation. For purposes of illustration, imagine that it is fi fteen hours after the explosion and you have been in a we ll-shielded fallout shelter the whole time. You want to go outs ide to decontaminate the area around the shelter. You took a reading four hours after the explosion which indicated an e xposure rate of 80 R per hour at that time. You are willing to accept 150 R of exposure if you have to. How long can you stay outside before you reach this level of exposure? Consulting figure 49, you see that the dose rate wa s 80 R per hour (A) at four hours after the explosion (B). A line connecting A to B intersects the H+l scale at 400 R per hour (C). Now turn to figure 50. You are willing to receive 1 5 0 R o f exposure (A). The H+1 dose rate was 400 R per hour (B). Draw a line from A to B and extend it to the center scal e (C). You plan to go outside beginning fifteen hours after th e explosion (D). A line drawn from C to D intercepts the \"Stay Time\" scale at twelve hours (E). This is the answer. Under thes e conditions, you can stay outside for twelve hours before acquir ing a dose of 150 rem. FIGURE 48: A slide-rule for predicting the rate of decay of fallout radiation.

The Need for Accurate and Dependable Fallout Met ers If a nuclear war ever strikes the United States, su rvivors of the blast and fire effects would need to have reliable means of knowing when t he radiation in the environment around their shelters had dropped enoug h to let them venture safely outside. Civil defense teams could use broadcasts o f surviving radio stations to give listeners a general idea of the fallout radiat ion in some broadcast areas. However, the fallout radiation would vary widely fr om point to point and the measurements would be made too far from most shelte rs to make them accurate enough to use safely. Therefore, each shelter shoul d have some dependable method of measuring the changing radiation dangers in its own area. During a possible nuclear crisis that was rapidly w orsening, or after a nuclear attack, most unprepared Americans could not buy or otherwise obtain a fallout meter -- an instrument that would greatly improve t heir chances of surviving a nuclear war. The fact that the dangers from fallout radiation -- best expressed in terms of the radiation dose rate, roentgens per hou r (R/hr) -- quite rapidly decrease during the first few days, and then decrease more a nd more slowly, makes it very important to have a fallout meter capable of accura tely measuring the unseen, unfelt and changing fallout dangers. Occupants of a fallout shelter should be able to control the radiation doses they receive. In ord er to effectively control the radiation doses, a dependable measuring instrument is needed to determine the doses they receive while they are in the shelter an d while they are outside for emergency tasks, such as going out to get badly nee ded water. Also, such an instrument would permit them to determine when it i s safe to leave the shelter for good. Untrained families, guided only by these written in structions and using only low cost materials and tools found in most homes, have been able to make a KFM by working 3 or 4 hours. By studying the operating sec tions of these instructions for about 1 1/2 hours, average untrained families have been able to successfully use this fallout meter to measure dose rates and to calculat e radiation doses received, permissible times of exposure, etc. The KFM (Kearny Fallout Meter) was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is understandable, easily repairable, and as acc urate as most civil defense fallout meters. In the United States in 1976 a commercially available ion chamber fallout meter that has as high a range as a KFM for gamma r adiation dose-rate measurements retailed for $600, Before a nuclear attack occurs is the best time to build, test and learn how to use a KFM. However, this instrument is so simple that it could be made even after fallout arrives provided that all the materials and tools needed (see lists given in Sections V, VI, and VII) and a copy of these instru ctions have been carried into the shelter. II. Survival Work Priorities During a Crisis Before building a KFM, persons expecting a nuclear attack within a few hours or days and already in the place where they intend to await attack should work with the following priorities: (1) build or improve a hi gh-protection-factor shelter (if possible, a shelter covered with 2 or 3 feet of ear th and separate from flammable buildings); (2) make and install a KAP (a homemade shelter-ventilating pump) -- if instructions and materials are available; (3) st ore at least 15 gallons of water for each shelter occupant — if containers are available ; (4) assemble all materials for one or two KFM's; and (5) make and store the drying agent (by heating wallboard gypsum, as later described) for both the KFM and it s dry-bucket. III. How to Use These Instructions to Best Advantag e 1. Read ALOUD all of these instructions through Sectio n VII, \"Tools Needed,\" before doing anything else. 2. Next assemble all of the needed materials and tools . 3. Then read ALOUD ALL of each section following Secti on VII before beginning to make the part described in that section. A FAMILY THAT FAILS TO READ ALOUD ALL OF EACH SECTION DESCRIBING HOW TO MAKE A PART, BEFORE BEGINNING TO MAKE THAT PART, WILL MAKE AVOID- ABLE MISTAKES AND WILL WASTE TIME. 4. Have different workers, or pairs of workers, mak e the parts they are best qualified to make. For example, a less skilled work er should start making the drying agent (as described in Section VTU) before o ther workers start making other parts. The most skilled worker should make an d install the aluminum-foil leaves (Sections X and XI). 5. Give workers the sections of the instructions cover ing the parts they are to build—so they can follow the step-by-step instructi ons, checking off with a pencil each step as it is completed. 6. Discuss the problems that arise. The head of the fa mily often can give better answers if he first discusses the different possibl e interpretations of some instructions with other family members, including t eenagers. 7. After completing one KFM and learning to use it, if time permits make a second KFM-that should be a better instrument. IV. What a KFM Is and How It Works A KFM is a simple electroscope fallout meter with which fallout radiation can be measured accurately. To use a KFM, an electrostatic charge must first be placed on its two separate aluminum-foil leaves. These leaves are insulated by being sus pended separately on clean, dry insulating threads. To take accurate readings, the air inside a KFM mus t be kept very dry by means of drying agents such as dehydrated gypsum (easily made by heating gypsum wallboard, \"sheetrock\") or silica gel. (Do not use calcium chloride or other salt.) Pieces of drying a gent are placed on the bottom of the ionization chamber (the housing can) of a KFM. An electrostatic charge is transferred from a homem ade electrostatic charging device to the two aluminum-foil leaves of a KFM by means of its charging-wire. The charging-wire extends out through the transpare nt plastic cover of the KFM. When the two KFM leaves are charged electrostati- cally, their like charges (both positive or both negative) cause them to be forced apart. When fallo ut gamma radiation (that is similar to X rays but more energetic) strikes the air inside the ionization ch amber of a KFM, it produces charged ions in this enclosed air. These charged ions cause part or all of the electrostatic charge on the aluminum-foil leaves to be discharged. As a result of losing charge, the two KFM leaves move closer together. To read the separation of the lower edges of the tw o KFM leaves with one eye, look straight down on the leaves and the scale on the clear plastic cover. Keep the reading eye 12 inches above the SEAT. The KFM should be resting on a horizontal surface. To be su re the reading eye is always at this exact distance, place the lower end of a 12-in ch ruler on the SEAT, while the upper end of the ruler touches the eyebrow above th e reading eye. It is best to hold the KFM can with one hand and the ruler with t he other. Using a flashlight makes the reading more accurate. If a KFM is made with the specified dimensions and of the specified materials, its accuracy is automatically and permanently establish ed. Unlike most radiation measuring instruments, a KFM never needs to be cali brated or tested with a radiation source, if made and maintained as specifi ed and used with the following table that is based on numerous calibrations made a t Oak Ridge National Labor- atory. The millimeter scale is cut out and attached (see p hoto illustrations on the following page) to the clear plastic cover of the KFM so that its zero mark is directly above the two leaves in their discharged position when the KF M is resting on a horizontal surface. A reading of the separation of the leaves is taken by noting the number of millimeters that the lower edge of one leaf appears to be on, on one side of the zero mark on the scale, and almost at the same time noti ng the number of millimeters the lower edge of the other leaf appears to be on, on the other side of the zero mark. The sum of these two apparent positions of the lowe r edges of the two leaves is called a KFM reading. The drawing appearing after t he photo illustrations shows the lower edges of the leaves of a KFM appearing to be 9 mm on the right and zero and 10 on the left, giving a KFM reading of 19 mm. (Usually the lower edges of the leaves are not at the same distance from the zero m ark.) 169 APPENDICES "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"1. charging and reading the KFM before exposure; 2. exposing it to radiation for a specified time in the location where measure- ment of the dose rate is needed -- when outdoors, holding the KFM about 3 ft. above the ground; 3. reading the KFM after its exposure; 4. calculating, by subtraction, the difference between the reading taken before exposure and the reading taken after exposure; 5. using this table to find what the dose rate was dur ing the exposure -- as will be described later. Instructions on how to use a KFM are given after th ose detailing how to make and charge this fallout meter. To get a clearer idea of the construction and use o f a KFM, look carefully at the following photos and read their captions. A. An Uncharged KFM. The charging wire has been pul led to one side by its adjustment-thread. This photo was taken looking straight down at the upper edges of the two flat, 8-ply aluminum leaves. At this angle the leaves are barely visible, hanging vertically side by side directly under the zero mark, touching each other and with their ends even. Their suspension- threads insulate the leaves. These threads are almost parallel and touch (but do not cross) each other where they extend over the top of the rim of the can. B. Charging a KFM by a Spark-Gap Discharge from a Tape That Has Been Electrostatically Charged by Being Unwound Quickly. Note that the charged tape is moved so that its surface is perpendicular to the charging-wire. The high-voltage electro- static charge on the un- wound tape (that is an insulator) jumps the spark-gap between the tape and the upper end of the charging-wire, and then flows down the charging-wire to charge the insulated aluminum- foiJ leaves of the KFM. (Since the upper edges of the two leaves are 3/4 inch below the scale and this is a photo taken at an angle, both leaves appear to be under the right side of the scale.) C. A Charged KFM. Note the separation of the upper edges of its two leaves. The charging- wire has been raised to an almost horizontal pos- ition so that its lower end is too far above the alu- minum leaves to permit electrical leakage from the leaves back up the charging-wire and into the outside air. Also note the SEAT, a piece of pencil taped to the right side of the can, opposite the charging wire. D. Reading a KFM. A 12- inch ruler rests on the SEAT and is held vert- ical, while the reader's eyebrow touches the upper end of the ruler. The lower edge of the right leaf is under 8 on the scale and the lower edge of the left leaf is under 6 on the scale, giving a KFM reading of 14. For accurate radiation measurements, a KFM should be placed on an approximately horizontal surface, but the charges on its two leaves and their displacements do not have to be equal. V. Materials Needed A. For the KFM: (In the following list, when mor e than one alternative material is given, the beet material is listed first.) 1. Any type metal can, approximately 2-9/16 inches in diameter inside and 2-7/8 inches high inside, washed clean with soap. ( This is the size of a standard 8-ounce can. Since most soup cans, pop can s, and beer cans also are about 2-9/16 inches in diameter inside, the req uired size of can can also be made by cutting down the height of more wid ely available cans -- as described in Section IX of these instructions.) 2. Standard aluminum foil - 2 square feet. (In 1977, 2 square feet of a typical American aluminum foil weighed about 8.2 grams -- a bout 0,29 oz.) (If only \"Heavy Duty\" or \"Extra Heavy Duty\" aluminum fo il is available, make S-ply leaves rather than 8-ply leaves of stand ard foil; the resultant fallout meter will be almost as accurate.) 3. Doorbell-wire, or other light insulated wire (prefe rably but not necessarily a single-strand wire inside the insulation) -- 6 in ches.

Any type of lightweight thread (preferably but not necessarily nylon). (Best is twisted nylon thread; next best, unwaxed l ightweight nylon dental floss; next best, silk; next best, polyester.) -- 3 feet. (Thread should be CLEAN, preferably not having been touched with fing ers. Monofilament nylon is too difficult to see, handle, and mark.) 5. A piece of clear plastic - a 6 x 6 inch square. Str ong polyethylene (4 mils thick) used for storm-proofing windows is best, but any reasonably stout and rather clear plastic will serve. The strong cle ar plastic used to wrap pieces of cheese, if washed with hot water and soap , is good. Do not use weak plastic or cellophane. 6. Cloth duct tape (\"silver tape\"), or masking tape, o r freezer tape, or Scotch-type tape -- about 10 square inches. (Save a t least 10 feet of Scotch Magic Transparent Tape for the charging device.) 7. Band-Aid tape, or masking tape, or freezer tape, or Scotch transparent tape, or other thin and very flexible tapes -- abou t 2 square inches. 8. Gypsum wallboard (sheetrock) - about 1/2 square foo t, best about 1/2 inch thick. (To make the essential drying agent.) 9. Glue -- not essential, but useful to replace Band-A id and other thin tapes. \"One hour\" epoxy is best. Model airplane cement is satisfactory. 10. An.ordinary wooden pencil and a small toothpick (or split a small sliver of wood). 11. Two strong rubber bands, or string. B. For the Charging Devices: 1. Most hard plastic rubbed on dry paper. This is t he best method. a. Plexiglas and most other hard plastics, such as are used in drafts- men's triangles, common smooth plastic rulers, etc. - at least 6 inches long. b. Dry paper - Smooth writing or typing paper. Tiss ue paper, news- paper, or facial tissue such as Kleenex, or toilet paper are satisfactory for charging, but not as durable. 2. Scotch Magic Transparent Tape (3/4 inch width is best), or Scotch Transparent Tape, or P.V.C, (Polyvinyl chloride) in sulating electrical tapes, or a few of the other common brands of Scotc h-type tapes. (Some plastic tapes do not develop sufficiently high-volt age electrostatic charges when unrolled quickly.) This method cannot be used for charging a KFM inside a dry-bucket, needed for charging when the a ir is very humid. C. For Determining Dose Rates and Recording Doses R eceived: 1. A watch -- preferably with a second hand. 2. A flashlight or other light, for reading the KFM in a dark shelter or at night. 3. Pencil and paper - preferably a notebook. D. For the Dry-Bucket: (A KFM must be charged insid e a dry-bucket if the air is very humid, as it often is inside a crowded, long-occupied shelter lacking adequate forced vent- ilation.) 1- A large bucket, pot, or can, preferably with a t op diameter of at least 11 inches. 2. Clear plastic (best is 4-mil-thick clear plastic us ed for storm windows). A square piece S inches wider on a side than the diam eter of the bucket to be used. 3. Cloth duct tape, one inch wide and 8 feet long (or 4 ft., if 2 inches wide). Or 16 ft. of freezer tape one inch wide. 4. Two plastic bags 14 to 16 inches in circumference, such as ordinary plastic bread bags. The original length of these bags shoul d be at least 5 inches greater than the height of the bucket. 5. About one square foot of wall board (sheetrock), to make anhydrite drying agent. 6. Two 1-quart Mason jars or other airtight containers , one in which to store anhydrite and another in which to keep dry the KFM charging devices. 7. Strong rubber bands - enough to make a loop around the bucket. Or string. 8. Four square feet of aluminum foil, to make a vapor- proof cover -- useful, but not essential. VI. Useful but not Essential Materials -Which Could be Obtained Before a Crisis- 1. An airtight container (such as a large peanut butte r jar) with a mouth at least 4 inches wide, in which to keep a KFM, along with som e drying agent, when it is not being used. Keeping a KFM very dry greatly exte nds the time during which the drying agent Inside the KFM remains effec tive. 2. Commercial anhydrite with a color indicator, such a s the drying agent Drierite. This granular form of anhydrite remains light blue as long as it is effective as a drying agent. Obtainable from laboratory supply sou rces. VII. Tools Needed Small nail - sharpened Stick, or a wooden tool handle (best 2-2 1/2 inch diameter and at least 12 inches long) Hammer Pliers Scissors Needle - quite a large sewing needle, but less than 2 1/2 inches long Knife with a small blade ~ sharp Ruler (12 inches) VIII. Make the Drying Agent -- The Easiest Part to Make, but Time Consuming - 1. For a KFM to measure radiation accurately, the air inside its ionization chamber must be kept very dry. An excellent drying agent (anhydrite) can be made by heating the gypsum in ordinary gypsum wallb oard (sheetrock). Do NOT use calcium chloride. 2. Take a piece of gypsum wallboard approximately 12 i nches by 6 inches, and preferably with its gypsum about 3/8 inches thick. Cut off the paper and glue, easiest done by first wetting the paper. (Since wat er vapor from normal air penetrates the plastic cover of a KFM and can dampe n the anhydrite and make it ineffective in as short a time as two days, fres h batches of anhydrite must be made before the attack and kept ready inside the sh elter for replacement. The useful life of the drying agent inside a KFM can be greatly lengthened by keeping the KFM inside an airtight container (such as a peanut butter jar with a 4-inch-diameter mouth) with some drying agent, wh en the KFM is not being used.] 3. Break the white gypsum filling into small pieces and make the largest no more than 1/2 in. across. (The tops of p ieces larger than this may be too close to the aluminum foil lea ves.) If the gypsum is dry, using a pair of pliers makes breakin g it easier. Make the largest side of the largest pieces no bigg er than this. 4. Dry gypsum is not a drying agent. To drive the wate r out of the gypsum molecules and produce the drying agent (anhydrite), heat the gypsum in an oven at its highest temperature (which should be ab ove 400 degrees F) for one hour. Heat the gypsum after placing the small piece s no more than two pieces deep in a pan. Or heat the pieces over a fire for 2 0 minutes or more in a pan or can heated to a dull red. 5. If sufficient aluminum foil and time are available, it is best to heat the gypsum and store the anhydrite as follows: a. So that the right amount of anhydrite can be tak en quickly out of its storage jar, put enough pieces of gypsum in a can w ith the same diameter as the KFM, measuring out a batch of gypsum that al most covers the bottom of the can with a single layer. b. Cut a piece of aluminum foil about 8 in. x 8 in. square, and fold up its edges to form a bowl-like container in which to hea t one batch of gypsum pieces. c. Measure out 10 or 12 such batches, and put each batch in its aluminum foil \"bowl.\" d. Heat all of these filled \"bowls\" of gypsum in ho ttest oven for one hour. e. As soon as the aluminum foil is cool enough to t ouch, fold and crumple the edges of each aluminum foil \"bowl\" together, to make a rough aluminum-covered \"ball\" of each batch of anhydrite. f. Promptly seal the batches in airtight jars or ot her airtight containers, and keep containers closed except when taking out an al uminum-covered \"ball.\" 6. Since anhydrite absorbs water from the air very rap idly, quickly put it in a dry airtight container while it is still quite hot. A M ason jar is excellent. 7. To place anhydrite in a KFM, drop in the pieces one by one, being careful not to hit the leaves or the stop-threads. The pieces should almost cover the bottom of the can, with no piece on top of other pi eces. 8. To remove anhydrite from a KFM, use a pair of sc issors or tweezers as forceps, holding them in a vertical position and no t touching the leaves. 171 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"IX. Make the Ionization Chamber of the KFM (To Avoid Mistakes and Save Time, Read All of This Section ALOUD Before Beginning Wor k.) 1. Remove the paper label (if any) from an ordinary 8- ounce can from which the top has been smoothly cut. Wash the can with soap a nd water and dry it. (An 8-ounce can has an inside diameter of about 2-9/16 inches and an inside height of about 2-7/8 inches.) 2. Skip to step 3 if an 8-ounce can is available. If a n 8-ounce can is not available, reduce the height of any other can having an inside diameter of about 2-9/16 inches (such as most soup cans, most pop cans, or m ost beer cans). To cut off the top part of a can, first measure and mark the l ine on which to cut. Then to keep from bending the can while cutting, wrap newsp aper tightly around a stick or a round wooden tool handle, so that the wo od is covered with 20 to 30 thicknesses of paper and the diameter (ideally) is only slightly less than the diameter of the can. One person should hold the can over the paper-cover ed stick while a second person cuts the can little by little along the mark ed cutting line. If leather gloves are available, wear them. To cut the can off smoothly, use a file, or use a hacksaw drawn backwards along the cutting line. O r cut the can with a sharp, short blade of a pocketknife by: (1) repeate dly stabbing downward vertically through the can into the paper, and (2) repeatedly making a cut about 1/4 inch long by moving the knife into a sloping po sition, while keeping its point still pressed into the paper covering the sti ck. Next, smooth the cut edge, and cover it with small pieces of freezer tape or other flexible tape. 3. Cut out the PAPER PATTERN TO WRAP AROUND KFM CAN. ( Cut one pattern out of the following Pattern Page A.) G lue (or tape) this pattern to the can, starting with one of the two sh ort sides of the pattern. Secure this starting short side directly over the s ide seam of the can. Wrap the pattern snugly around the can, gluing or t aping it securely as it is being wrapped. (If the pattern is too wide to fi t flat between the rims of the can, trim a little off its lower edge.) 4. Sharpen a small nail, by filing or rubbing on concr ete, for use as a punch to make the four holes needed to install the stop-t hreads in the ionization chamber (the can). (The stop-threads are insulators that stop the charged aluminum leaves from touching the can and b eing discharged.) 5. Have one person hold the can over a horizontal stick or a round wooden tool-handle, that ideally has a diameter about as large as the dia- meter of the can. Then a second person can use the sharpened nail and a ham- mer to punch four very small holes through the sides of the can at the points shown by the four crosses on the pattern. Make these holes just large enough to run a needle through them, and then move the needle in the holes so as to bend back the obstructing points of metal. 6. The stop-threads can be installed by using a needle to thread a single thread through all four holes. Use a very clean thread,' prefer- ably nylon, and do not touch the parts of this thread that will be inside the can and will serve as the insulating stop-threads. Soiled threads are poor insulators. (See illustrations.) X. Make Two Separate 3-P1y Leaves of Standard [Not Heavy Duty*] Aluminum Foil Proceed as follows to make each leaf: 1. Cut out a piece of standard aluminum foil approximately 4 inches by 8 inches. 2. Fold the aluminum foil to make a 2-ply (= 2 thicknesses) sheet approximately 4 inches by 4 inches. 3. Fold this 2-ply sheet to make a 4-ply sheet approximately 2 inches by 4 inches. 4. Fold this 4-ply sheet to make an 8-ply sheet (8 she ets thick) approximately 2 inches by 2 inches, being sure that the two halves of the second-fold edge are exactly together. This third folding makes an 8-ply aluminum foil sheet with one corner exactly square. 5. Cut out the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, found on the fol lowing Pattern Page B. Note that this pattern is NOT a square and that it is smaller than the 8-ply sheet. Flatten the 8 thicknesses of aluminum foil w ith the fingers until they appear to be a single thin, flat sheet. 6. Hold the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN on top of the 8-ply aluminum foil sheet, with the pattern's THIRD-FOLD EDGE on top of the third-fold edge of the 8-ply aluminum sheet. Be sure that one lower co rner of the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN is on top of the exactly squa re corner of the 8-ply aluminum sheet. 7. White holding a straight edge along the THREAD LINE of the pattern, press with a sharp pencil so as to make a shallow groove for the THREAD LINE on the 8-ply aluminum sheet. Also using a sharp pencil, trace around the top and side of the pattern, so as to indent (groove) the 8-ply foil. 8. Remove the pattern, and cut out the 8-ply aluminum foil leaf. 9. While holding a straight edge along the indented THREAD LINE, lift up the OPEN EDGE of the 8-ply sheet (keeping all 8 plies together) until this edge is ver- tical, as illustrated. Remove the straight edge, and fold the 8-ply aluminum along the THREAD LINE so as to make a flat-folded hem. 10. Open the flat-folded hem of the finished leaf until the 8-ply leaf is almost flat again, as shown by the pattern, from which the FIN- ISHED-LEAF PATTERN has al- ready been cut. 11. Prepare to attach the aluminum- foil leaf to the thread that will suspend it inside the KFM. *If only heavy duty aluminum foil (sometimes called \"ex tra heavy duty\") is available, make 5-ply leaves of the same size, and use the table for the 8-ply KFM to determine radiation dose rates. To make a 5-ply leaf, start by cutting out a piece of foil approximately 4 inches by 4 inches. F old it to make a 4-ply sheet approximately 2 inches by 2 inches, with one corner exactly square. Next from a single thickness of foil cut a square approximately 2 inches by 2 inches. Slip this square into a 4-ply sheet, thus making a 5-ply shee t. Then make the 5-ply leaf, using the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, etc. as described for making an 8-ply leaf. If no epoxy glue* is available to hold down the hem and prevent the thread from slipping in the hem, cut two pieces of tape (Band-Aid tape is best; next best is masking or freezer tape; next be st, Scotch tape). After first peeling off the paper backing of Band-Aid tap e, cut each piece of tape 1/8 inch by 1 inch long. Attach these two piec es of tape to the finished 8-ply aluminum leaf with the sticky sides up, except for their ends. As shown by the pattern on the following patt ern page, secure 1/8 inch of one end of a tape strip near one corner of the 8-ply aluminum foil leaf by first turning under this l/8-inch end; that is, with this end's sticky side down. Then turn under the other 1/8-inc h-long end, and attach this end below the THREAD LINE. Slant each t ape strip as illustrated on Pattern (C). SINGLE THREAD THREADED THROUGH 4 HOLES TO MAKE 2 STOP-THREADS Before threading the thread through the four holes, tic a small toggle (see the preceding sketch) to the long end of the thread. (T his toggle can easily be made of a very small sliver of wood cut about 3/8 in. lo ng.) After the thread has been pulled through the four holes, attach a second togg le to the thread, about 1/2 inch from the part of the thread that comes out of the f ourth hole. Then the thread can be pulled tightly down the side of the can and the second small toggle can be taped securely in place to the side of the can. (If the thread is taped down without a toggle, it is likely to move under the tape.) The first toggle and all of the four holes also sho uld be covered with tape, to prevent air from leaking into the can after it has been covered and is being used as an ionization chamber. Be sure you have read through step 18 before you do anything else.

Cut an 8-l/2-inch piece of fine, unwaxed. very clean thread. (Nylon twisted thread, unwaxed extra-fine nylon dental flo ss, or silk thread are best in this order. Nylon monofilament \"invisible\" thread is an excellent insulator but is too difficult for most people to h andle.) Cut out Pattern (C), the guide sheet used when atta ching a leaf to its suspending thread. Then tape Pattern (C) to the top of a work table. Cover the two \"TAPE HERE\" rectangles on Pattern (C) with pieces of tape, each piece the size of the rectangle. Then cu t two other pieces of tape each the same size and use them to tape the th read ONTO the guide sheet, on top of the \"TAPE HERE\" rectangles. Be very careful not to touch the two 1-inch parts o f the thread next to the outline of the finished leaf, since oil and dirt ev en on clean fingers will reduce the electrical insulating value of the threa d between the leaf and the top rim of the can. 13. With the thread still taped to the paper pattern an d while slightly lifting the thread with a knife tip held under the center o f the thread, slip the finished leaf under the thread and into position ex actly on the top of the leaf outlined on the pattern page. Hold the leaf in this position with two fingers. 14. While keeping the thread straight between its two t aped-down ends, lower the thread so that it sticks to the two plast ic strips. Then press the thread against the plastic strips. 15. With the point of the knife, hold down the center o f the thread against the center of the THREAD LINE of the leaf. Then, wi th two fingers, carefully fold over the hem and press it almost fla t. Be sure that the thread comes out of the corners of the hem. Remove the knife, and press the hem down completely flat against the rest of th e leaf. 16. Make small marks on the thread at the two points sh own on the pattern page. Use a ballpoint pen if available. 17. Loosen the second two small pieces of tape from the partem paper, but leave these tapes stuck to the thread. 18. Cut 5 pieces of Band-Aid tape, each approximately 1/8 inch by 1/4 inch, this small. Use 3 of these pieces of tape to secure the centers of the side edges of the leaf. Place the 5 pieces as illustrated in the SIDE VIEW sketch below. *If using epoxy or other glue, use only a very litt le to hold down the hem, to attach the thread securely to the leaf and to glue together any open edges of the plied foil. Most convenient is \"one hour\" epoxy, ap plied with a toothpick. Model airplane cement requires hours to harden when appli ed between sheets of aluminum foil. To make sure no glue stiffens the fr ee thread beyond the upper comers of the finished leaf, put no glue within 1 / 4 inch of a point where thread will go out from the folded hem of the leaf. The instructions in step 11 are for persons lacking \"one hour\" epoxy or the time required to dry other types of glue. Persons using glue instead of tape to attach the leaf to its thread should make appropriate use of t he pattern on the following page and of some of the procedures detailed in steps 12 through 18. XI. Install the Aluminum-Foil Leaves 1. Use the two small pieces of tape stuck to the ends of a leaf-suspending thread to attach the thread to the outside of the can. Att ach the tapes on opposite sides of the can, so as to suspend the leaf inside the can. See END VIEW sketch. Each of the two marks on the attached threa d MUST rest exactly on the top of the rim of the can, preferably in two ve ry small notches filed in the top of the rim of the can. Each of these two marks on a thread should be positioned exactly above one of the two points show n on the pattern wrapped around the can. Be sure that the hem-side of each o f the two leaves faces outward. Sec END VIEW sketch. 2. Next, the suspending thread of the first leaf shoul d be taped to the top of the rim. Use a piece of Band-Aid only about 1/8 in. x 1 /4 in., sticking it to the rim of the can so as barely to cover the thread on the side where the second leaf will be suspended. Make sure no parts of the tapes are i nside the can. 3. Position and secure the second leaf, being sure tha t: a. The smooth sides of the two leaves are smooth (n ot bent) and face each other and are flush (= \"right together\") when not c harged. See END VIEW sketch and study the first photo illustration, \"An Uncharged KFM\". b. The upper edges of the two leaves are suspended side by side and at the same distance below the top of the can. c. The leaf-suspending threads are taped with Band- Aid to the top of the rim of the can (so that putting the cover on will not m ove the threads). d. No parts of the leaf-suspending threads inside t he can are taped down to the can or otherwise restricted. e. The leaf-suspending parts of the threads inside the can do not cross over, entangle or restrict each other. f. The threads come together on the top of the rim of the can, and that the leaves are fiat and hang together as shown in the f irst photo illustration, \"An Uncharged KFM,\" g. If the leaves do not look like these photographe d leaves, make new, better leaves and install them. 4. Cover with tape the parts of the threads that exten d down the outside of the can, and also cover with more tape the small pieces of tape near the ends of the threads on the outside of the can. 5. To make the SEAT, cut a piece of a wooden pencil, o r a stick, about one inch long and tape it securely to the side of the can al ong the center line marked SEAT on the pattern. Be sure the upper end of this piece of pencil is at the same position as the top of the location for the SE AT outlined on the pattern. The top of the SEAT is 3/4 inch below the top of th e can. Be sure not to cover or make illegible any part of the table printed on the paper pattern. 6. Cut out one of the \"Reminders for Operators\" and glue and/or tape it to the unused side of the KFM. Then it is best to cover al l the sides of the finished KFM with clear plastic tape or vamish. This will ke ep sticky-tape on the end of an adjustment thread or moisture from damaging the \"Reminders\" or the table. XII. Make the Plastic Cover 1. Cut out the paper pattern for the cover from the Pa ttern Page (B). 2. From a piece of clear, strong plastic, cut a circle approximately the same size as the paper pattern. (Storm-window polyethylene pl astic, 4 mils thick, is best.) 3. Stretch the center of this circular piece of clear plastic over the open end of the can, and pull it down close to the sides of the can , making small tucks in the \"skirt,\" so that there are no wrinkles in the top c over. Hold the lower part of the \"skirt\" in place with a strong rubber band or p iece of string. (If another can having the same diameter as the KFM can is avai lable, use it to make the cover - to avoid the possibility of disturbing the leaf-suspending threads.) 4. Make the cover so it fits snugly, but can be taken off and replaced readily. Just below the top of the rim of the can, bind the covering plastic in place with a J/4-inch-wide piece of strong tape. (Cloth duct tape is best. If only freezer or masking tape is available, use two thicknesses.) 177 APPENDICES Keep v ertical the small part of the tape that presses against the rim of the can while pulling the length of the tape horizontally around the can so a s to bind the top of the plastic cover snugly to the rim. If this small part of the tape is kept vertical, the lower edge of the tape will not squeeze the plastic below the rim of the can to such a small circumference as to prevent the cover from be ing removed quite easily."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 179 APPENDICES"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 5. With scissors, cut off the \"skirt\" of the plastic c over until it extends only about one inch below the top of the rim of the can. 6. Make a notch in the \"skirt,\" about one inch wide, w here it fits over the pencil SEAT attached to the can. The \"skirt\" in this notch ed area should be only about 5/8 of an inch long, measured down from the t op of the rim of the can. 7. Remove the plastic cover, and then tape the lower e dges of the \"skirt,\" inside and out, using short lengths of 1/4-inch-wide tape. Before securing each short piece of tape, slightly open the tucks that are bei ng taped shut on their edges, so that the \"skirt\" flares slightly outward and the cover can be readily removed. 8. Put the plastic cover on the KFM can. From the P attern Page (B) cut out the SCALE. Then tape the SCALE to the top of the plasti c cover, in the position shown on the pattern for the cover, and also by the drawings. Preferably use transparent tape. Be careful not to cover with tape any of the divisi on lines on the SCALE between 20 on the right and 20 on the left of 0. 9. Make the charging-wire by following the pattern given below which is exactly the right size. Doorbell wire with an outside diameter of about 1/1 6 inch is best, but any lightweight insulated wire, such as part of a light weight two-wire extension cord split in half, will serve. The illustrated wir e is much thicker than bell wire. To stop tape from possibly slipping up or dow n the wire, use a very little glue. If a very thin plastic has been used for the cover, a sticky piece of tape may need to be attached to the end of the bare-ended ad justment thread, so both threads can be used to hold the charging wire in a desired position. The best tape to attach to an end of one of the adj ustment-threads is cloth duct tape, A square piece 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch is the st icky base. To keep this tape sticky (free of paper fibers), the paper on the can should be covered with transparent tape or varnish. A piece about 1/8 inch by 3/4 inch serves to stick under one end of the sticky base, to hold the adjus tment-thread. A 3/4 inch by 1-1/4 inch rectangular piece of tape is used to mak e the finger hold - important for making adjustments inside a dry-bucke t. With a needle or pin, make a hole in the plastic co ver 1/2 inch from the rim of the can and directly above the upper end of the CEN TER LINE between the two leaves. The CENTER LINE is marked on the patter n wrapped around the can. Carefully push the CHARGING-WIRE through this hole (thus stretching the hole) until all of the CHARGING-WIRE below its Band-Aid-tape stop is inside the can. XIII. Two Ways to Charge a KFM 1. Charging a KFM with Hard Plastic Rubbed on Dry P aper. a. Adjust the charging-wire so that its lower end is about 1/16 inch above the upper edges of the aluminum-foil leaves. Use the sticky-tape at the end of one adjust- ment-thread to hold the charging-wire in this position. Stick this tape approximately in line with the threads suspending the leaves, either on the side of the can or on top of the plastic cover. (If the charging-wire is held loose- ly by the cover, it may be necessary to put a piece of sticky-tape on the end of each adjustment-thread in order to adjust the charging-wire securely. If a charging-wire is not s ecure, its lower end may be forced up by the like charge on the leaves befor e the leaves can be fully charged.) b. Select a piece of Plexiglas, a draftsman's plast ic triangle, a smooth plastic ruler, or other piece of hard, smooth plastic. (Unf ortunately, not all types of hard plastic can be used to generate a sufficien t electrostatic charge.) Be sure the plastic is dry. For charging a KFM inside a dry-bucket, cut a recta ngular piece of hard plastic about 1-1/2 by S inches. Sharp corners and edges can be smoothed by rubbing on concrete. To avoid contaminating the charging end with sweaty, oily fingers, it is best to mark the other end with a piece of tape. c. Fold DRY paper (typing paper, writing paper, or other smooth, clean paper) to make an approximate square about 4 inches on a side and about 20 sheets thick. (This many sheets of paper lessens leakage to the fingers of the electrostatic charges to be generated on the hard plastic and on the rubbed paper.) d. Fold the square of paper in the middle, and move the hard plastic rapidly back and forth so that it is rubbed vigorously on the paper in the middle of this folded square — while the outside of this folded square of paper is squeezed firmly between thumb and the ends of two fingers. To avoid discharging the charge on the plastic to the fingers, keep them away from the edges of the paper. See photo. e. Move the electrostatically charged part of the rubbed plastic rather slowly past the upper end of the charging- wire, while looking straight down on the KFM. Keep the hard plastic approximately perpendicular to the cha rging-wire and about 1/4 to 1/2 inch away from its upper end. The charge jumps the spark gaps and charges the leaves of the KFM. f. Pull down on an insulating adjustment-thread to raise the lower end of the charging-wire. (If the charging-wire has been held in its charging position by its sticky-ended adjustment-thread being stuck t o the top of the clear plastic cover, to avoid possibly damaging the threa ds: (1) pull down a little on the bare-ended adjustment-thread; and (2) detach , pull down on, and secure the sticky-ended adjustment-thread to the si de of the can, so as to raise and keep the lower end of the charging-wire c lose to the underside of the clear plastic cover.) Do not touch the charging -wire. g. Put the charging paper and the hard plastic in a container where they will be kept dry -- as in a Mason jar with some drying a gent. 2. Charging a KFM from a Quickly Unwound Roll of Ta pe. (Quick unwinding produces a harmless charge of several thousand volt s on the tape.) a. Adjust the charging-wire so that its lower end i s about 1/16 inch above the upper edges of the aluminum-foil leaves. Use the st icky-tape at the end of one adjustment-thread to hold the charging-wire in this position. Stick this tape approximately in line with the leaves, either on the side of the can or on the plastic cover. (If the plastic cover is weak , it may be necessary to put a piece of sticky-tape on the end of each adjus tment-thread, in order to hold the charging-wire securely. If a charging-wire is not secure, its lower end may be forced up by the like charge on the leav es before the leaves can be fully charged.) 181 APPENDICES "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"EXACT SIZE STICKY-ENDED ADJUSTMENT-THREAD (OVERSIZED DRAWING) d. While holding the unwound tape tight, about perp endicular to the charging-wire, and about 1/4 inch away from the end of the charging-wire, promptly move both hands and the tape to the right rather slowly - taking about 2 seconds to move about 8 inches. The electro static charge on the unwound tape \"jumps\" the spark gaps from the tape t o the upper end of the charging-wire and from the lower end of the cha rging-wire to the aluminum leaves, and charges the aluminum leaves. Be sure neither leaf is touching a stop-thread. Try to charge the leaves enough to spread them far enough apart to give a reading of at least 15 mm. Pull down on an insulating adjustment-thread to rai se the lower end of the charging-wire. If the charging-wire has been held i n charging position by its sticky-ended adjustment-thread being stuck to t he top of the clear plastic cover, it is best first to pull down a little on the bare-ended adjustment-thread, and then to move, pull down on, and secure the sticky-ended adjustment-thread to the side of the can so that the lower part of the charging-wire is close to the underside of the clear plastic cover. Do not touch the charging-wire. Rewind the tape tight on its roil, for future use w hen other tape may not be available. b. The sketch shows the \"GET SET\" position, preparatory to unrolling the Scotch Magic Transparent Tape, P.V.C elec- trical tape, or other tape. Be sure to first remove the roll from its dispenser. Some of the other kinds of tape will not produce a high enough voltage. c. QUICKLY unroll 10 to 12 inches of tape by pulling its end with the left hand, while the right hand allows the roll to unwind while remaining in about the same \"GET SET\" position only an inch or two away from the KFM.

Make and Use a Dry-Bucket By charging a KFM while it is inside a dry-bucket with a transparent plastic cover (see illustration), this fallout meter can be charged and used even if the relative humidity is 100% outside the dry-bucket. The air inside the dry-bucket is kept very dry by a drying agent placed on its bottom. About a cupful of anhydrite serves very well. The pieces of this dehydrated gypsum need not be as uniform in size as is best for use inside a KFM, but do not use powdered anhy- drite. A dry-bucket can be readily made in about an hour by proceeding as follows: 1. Remove the handle of a large bucket, pot, or can pr eferably with a top diameter of at least 11 inches. A 4-gallon buck et having a top diameter of about 14 inches is ideal. If the handle -supports interfere with stretching a piece of clear plastic film acros s the top of the bucket, remove them, being sure no sharp points rem ain. 2. Cut out a circular piece of clear plastic with a di ameter about 5 inches larger than the diameter of the top of the bucket. Clear polyethylene 4 mils thick, used for storm windows, etc., is best . Stretch the plastic smooth across the top of the bucket, and ti e it in place, preferably with strong rubber bands looped together to form a circle. 3. Make a plastic top that fits snugly but is easily r emovable, by taping over and around the plastic just below the top of t he bucket. One-inch-wide cloth duct tape, or one-inch-wide gla ss-reinforced strapping tape, serves well. When taping, do not permit the lower edge of the tape to be pulled inward below the rim of the bucket. 4. Cut two small holes (about 1 inch by 2 inches) in t he plastic cover, as illustrated. Then make the radial cuts (shown by do tted lines) outward from the small holes, out to the solid-line outlines of the 3 inch by 4 inch hand-holes, so as to form small flap s. 5. Fold the small flaps upward, so they are vertical. Then tape them on their outer sides, so they form a vertical \"wall\" a bout 3/4 inch high around each hand-hole. 6. Reduce the length of two ordinary plastic bread bag s (or similar plastic bags) to a length that is 5 inches greater than the height of the bucket. (Do not use rubber gloves in place of bags; gloves so used result in much more humid outside air being uninten tionally pumped into a dry-bucket when it is being used while charg ing a KFM inside it.) 7. Insert a plastic bag into each hand-hole, and fold the edge of the plastic bag about 1/2 inch over the taped vertical \"wall\" around each hand-hole. 8. Strengthen the upper parts of the plastic bags by f olding 2-inch pieces of tape over the top of the \"wall\" around ea ch hand-hole. 9. Make about a quart of anhydrite by heating small pi eces of wall-board gypsum, and keep this anhydrite dry in a Mason jar or other airtight container with a rubber or plastic s ealer. 10. Make a circular aluminum-foil cover to place over t he plastic cover when the dry-bucket is not being used for minutes t o hours. Make this cover with a diameter about 4 inches greater t han the diameter of the top of the bucket, and make it fit more snug ly with an encircling loop of rubber bands, or with string. Al though not essential, an aluminum-foil cover reduces the amoun t of water vapor that can reach and pass through the plastic cover, thus extending the life of the drying agent. 11. Charge a KFM inside a dry-bucket by: a. Taking off wrist watch and sharp-pointed rings t hat might tear the plastic bags. b. Placing inside the dry-bucket: (1) About a cup of anhydrite or silica gel; (2) the KFM, with its charging-wire adjusted in its cha rging position; and (3) dry, folded paper and the electrostatic charging de vice, best a 5-inch-long piece of Plexiglas with smoothed edges, to be rubbed between dry paper folded about 4 inches square and about 20 sheets thick. (Unrolling a roll of tape inside a dry-bucket is an impractical charg ing method.) c. Replacing the plastic cover, that is best held i n place with a loop of rubber bands. d. Charging the KFM with your hands inside the plas tic bags, operating the charging device. Have another person illuminate the KFM with a flashlight. When adjustin g the charging-wire, move your hands very slowly. See the dry-bucket photos. 12. Expose the KFM to fallout radiation either by: a. Leaving the KFM inside the dry-bucket while expo sing it to fallout radiation for one of the listed time interv als, and reading the KFM before and after the exposure while it remains inside the dry-bucket. (The reading eye sho uld be a measured 12 inches above the SEAT of the KFM, and a flashlight or other light should be used.) b. Taking the charged KFM out of the dry-bucket to read it, expose it, and read it after the exposure. (If this is done repeatedly, especially in a humid shelter, the dryi ng agent will not be effective for many KFM chargings, and w ill have to be replaced.) How to Use a KFM after a Nuclear Attack A. Background Information If during a rapidly worsening crisis threatening nu clear war you are in the place where you plan to take shelter, postpone stud ying the instructions following this sentence until after you have: (1) built or improved a high-protection-factor shelter (if possible, a shelter covered with 2 or 3 ft of earth and separate from flammable buildings), and (2) made a KAP (homemade shelter-ventilating pump) if y ou have the instructions and materials, and 183 APPENDICES XV."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"(3) stored at least 15 gallons of water for each shelter occupant if you can obtain containers. Having a KFM or any other dependable fallout meter and knowing how to operate it will enable you to minimize radiation in juries and possible fatalities, especially by skillfully using a high-p rotection-factor fallout shelter to control and limit exposures to radiation . By studying this section you first will learn how to measure radiati on dose rales (roentgens per hour = R/hr), how to calculate doses [R] receiv ed in different time intervals, and how to determine time Intervale (hou rs and/or minutes) in which specified doses would be received. Then this section lists the sizes Of doses (number of R) that the average person can tolerate without being sickened, that he is likely to survive, and that he is likely to be killed by. Most fortunately for the future of all living thing s, the decay of radioactivity causes the sandlike fallout particles to become less and less dangerous with the passage of time. Each fallout pa rticle acts much like a tiny X ray machine would if it were made so that it s rays, shooting out from it like invisible light, became weaker and wea ker with time. Contrary to exaggerated accounts of fallout dangers , the radiation does rate from fallout particles when they reach the gro und in the areas of the heaviest fallout will decrease quite rapidly. For e xample, consider the decay of fallout from a relatively nearby, large su rface burst, at a place where the fallout particles are deposited on the gr ound one hour after the explosion. At this time one hour after the explosio n, assume that the radiation dose rate (the best measure of radiation danger at a particular time) measures 2,000 roentgens per hour (2,000 R/hr ) outdoors. Seven hours later the dose rate is reduced to 200 R/hr by normal radioactive decay. Two days after the explosion, the dose rate outdoors is reduced by radioactive decay to 20 R/hr. After two weeks, the dose rate is less than 2 R/hr. When the dose rate is 2 R/hr, people can go o ut of a good shelter and work outdoors for 3 hours a day, receiving a da ily dose of 6 roentgens, without being sickened. In places where fallout arrives several hours after the explosion, the radioactivity of the fallout will have gone through its time period of most rapid decay while the fallout particles were still airborne. If you are in a location so distant from the explosion that fallout arrives 8 hours after the explosion, two days must pass before the initial do se rate measured at your location will decay to 1/10 its initial intens ity. B. Finding the Dose Rale 1. Reread Section IV, \"What a KFM Is and How It Works. \" Also reread Section XIII, \"Two Ways to Charge a KFM ,\" and actually do each step immediately after reading it. 2. Charge the KFM, raise the lower end of its charging -wire and read the apparent separation of the lower edges of its leaves while the KFM rests on an approximately hori zontal surface. Never take a reading while a leaf is touch ing a stop-thread. 3. Expose the KFM to fallout radiation for one of the time intervals shown in the vertical columns of the tabl e attached to the KFM. (Study the following table.) If the dos e rate is not known even approximately, first expose the full y charged KFM for one minute. For dependable measurements outdoors, expose the charged KFM about three feet above the ground. For most exposures, co nnect the KFM to a stick or pole (best done with two rubb er bands), and expose it about three feet above the gr ound. Be careful not to tilt the KFM too much. 4. Read the KFM after the exposure, while the KFM rest s on an approximately horizontal surface. 5. Find the time interval that gives a dependable read ing - by exposing the fully charged KFM for one or more of t he listed time intervals until the reading after the exposure la: (a) Not less than 5 mm. (b) At least 2 mm less than the reading before the exposure. 6. Calculate by simple subtraction the difference in t he apparent separation of the lower edges of the leave s before the exposure and after the exposure. An example: If the reading before the exposure is 18 mm and the readin g after the exposure is 6 mm, the difference in readings is 18mm - 6 mm = 12 mm. 7. If an exposure results in a difference in readings of less than 2 mm, recharge the KFM and expose it again for one of the longer time intervals listed. (If there appears to be no difference in the readings taken before and after a n exposure for one minute, this does not prove there is absolutely no fallout danger.) 8. If an exposure results in the reading after the exp osure being less than 5 mm, recharge the KFM and expose i t again for one of the shorter time intervals listed. 9. Use the table attached to the KFM to find the dose rale (R/hr) during the time of exposure. The dose rate (R/hr) is found at the intersection of the vertical column of numbers under the time interval used and of the horizontal line of num- bers that lists the calculated difference in readings at its left end. An example: If the time interval of the exposure was 1 MIN. and the difference in readings was 12 an, the the table shows that the dose rale during the time interval of the exposure was 9.2 R/HR (9.2 roentgens per hour). Another example: If the time interval of the exposu re was 15 SEC. and the difference in readings was 11 mm, t he table shows that the dose rate during the exposure was ha lfway between 31 R/HR and 37 R/HR that is, the dose rale was 34 R/hr. 10. Note in the table that if an exposure for one o f the listed time intervals causes the difference in readings to be 2 mm or 3 mm, then an exposure 4 times as long reveals the sa me dose rate. An example: If a 1-min exposure results in a difference in readings of 2 mm, the table shows the dose rate was 1.6 R/hr; then if the KFM is exposed for 4 minu tes at this same dose rate of 1.6 R/hr, the table shows th at the resultant difference in readings is 8 mm. The longer exposure results in a more accurate determination of the dose rate. 11. If the dose rate is found to be greater than 0. 2 R/hr and time is available, recharge the KFM and repeat the dose- rate measurement -- to avoid possible mistakes. C. Calculating the Dose Received The dose of fallout radiation -- that is, the amoun t of fallout radiation received -- determines the harmful effects on men a nd animals. Being exposed to a high dose rale is not always dangerous -- provided the exposure is short enough to result in only a small dose being received. For example, if the dose rate outside an excellent fall out shelter is 1200 R/hr and a shelter occupant goes outside for 30 seconds, he would be exposed for 1/2 of 1 minute, or 1/2 of 1/60 of an hour, whi ch equals 1/120 hour. Therefore, since the dose he would receive if he st ayed outside for 1 hour would be 1200 R, in 30 seconds he would receive 1/1 20 of 1200, which equals 10 R (1200 R divided by 120 = 10 R). A total dally dose of 10 R (10 roentgens) will not cause any symptoms if it is not repeated day after day for a week or more. In contrast, if the average dose rate of an area we re found to be 12 R/hr and if a person remained exposed in that particular area for 24 hours, he would receive a dose of 288 R (12 R/hr x 24 hr = 28 8 R). Even assuming that this person had been exposed previously to ver y little radiation, there would still be a serious risk that this 288 R dose would be fatal under the difficult conditions that would follow a heavy nucl ear attack. Another example: Assume that three days after an at tack the occupants of a dry, hot cave giving almost complete protectio n against fallout are in desperate need of water. The dose rate outside is f ound to be 20 R/hr. To backpack water from a source 3 miles away is estima ted to take 2-1/2 hours. The cave occupants estimate that the water b ackpackers will receive a dose in 2-1/2 hours of 50 R (2.5 hr x 20 R/hr - 50 R). A dose of 50 R will cause only mild symptoms (nausea in about 10% of persons receiving a 50 R dose) for persons who previously h ave received only very small doses. Therefore, one of the cave occupants m akes a rapid radiation survey for about 1-1/2 miles along the proposed rou te, stopping to charge and read a KFM about every quarter of a mile. He fi nds no dose rates much higher than 20 R/hr. So, the cave occupants decide the risk is small eno ugh to justify some of them leaving shelter for about 2-1/2 hours to get w ater. D. Estimating the Dangers from Different Rad iation Doses Fortunately, the human body — if given enough time -- can repair most of the damage caused by radiation. An historic example : A healthy man accidently received a daily dose of 9.3 R (or somew hat more) of fallout-type radiation each day for a period of 106 days. His total accumulated dose was at least 1000 R, A dose of one thousand roentgens, if received in a few days, is almost three times th e dose likely to kill the average man if he receives the whole dose in a few days and after a nuclear attack cannot get medical treatment, adequa te rest, etc. However, the only symptom this man noted was seriou s fatigue. The occupants of a high-protection-factor shelter ( such as a trench shelter covered with 2 or 3 feet of earth and having crawlw ay entrances) would receive less than 1/200 of the radiation dose they would receive outside. Even in most areas of very heavy fallout, persons w ho remain continously LIFE AFTER DOOMSDAY 184 "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"in such a shelter would receive a total accumulated dose of less than 25 R in the first day after the attack, and less than 10 0 R in the first two weeks. At the end of the first two weeks, such shelter occ upants could start working outside for an increasing length of time ea ch day, receiving a daily dose of no more than 6 R for up to two months without being sickened. To control radiation exposure in this way, each she lter must have a fallout meter, and a daily record must be kept of the appro ximate total dose received each day by every shelter occupant, both w hile inside and outside the shelter. The long-term penalty which would resu lt from a dose of 100 R received within a few weeks is much less than man y Americans fear. If 100 average persons received an external dose of 10 0 R during and shortly after a nuclear attack, the studies of the Japanese A-bomb survivors indicate that no more than one of them is likely to die during the following 30 years as a result of this 100 R radiation dose. These delayed radiation deaths would be due to leukemia and other cancers. In the desperate crisis period following a major nuclear attack, suc h a relatively small shortening of life expectancy during the following 30 years should not keep people from starting recovery work to save the mselves and their fellow citizens from death due to lack of food and other essentials. A healthy person who previously has received a tota l accumulated dose of no more than 100 R distributed over a 2-week period should realize that: 100 R, even if all received in a day or less, is un likely to require medical care-provided during the next 2 weeks a tot al additional dose of no more than a few R is received. 350 R received in a few days or less is likely to p rove fatal after a large nuclear attack when few survivors could get medical care, sanitary surroundings, a well-balanced diet, or adequate res t. 600 R received in a few days or less is almost cert ain to cause death within a few days. E, Using a KFM to Reduce the Doses Received Inside a S helter Inside most shelters, the dose received by an occup ant varies considerably, depending on the occupant's location. For example, inside an expedient covered-trench shelter the dose rate i s higher near the entrance than in the middle of the trench. In a typ ical basement shelter the best protection is found in one corner. Especia lly during the first several hours after the arrival of fallout, when th e dose rates and doses received are highest, shelter occupants should use their fallout meters to determine where to place themselves to minimize the doses they receive. They should use available tools and materials to re duce the doses they receive, especially during the first day, by diggin g deeper (if practical) and reducing the size of openings by partially bloc king them with earth, water containers, etc. -- while maintaining adequat e ventilation. To greatly reduce the danger from fallout particles en tering the body through nose or mouth, shelter occupants should at least co ver their nose and mouth with a towel or other cloth while the fallout is being deposited outside their shelter. The air inside an occupied shelter often becomes ve ry humid. If a good flow of outdoor air is flowing into a shelter - esp ecially if pumped by briefly operating a KAP or other ventilating pump - - a KFM usually can be charged at the air intake of the shelter room witho ut putting it inside a dry-bucket. However, if the air to which a KFM is e xposed has a relative humidity of 90% or higher, the instrument cannot be charged, even by quickly unrolling a roll of tape. In extensive areas of heavy fallout, the occupants of most home basements, that provide inadequate shielding agains t heavy fallout radiation, would be in deadly danger. By using a de pendable fallout meter, occupants would find that persons lying on t he floor in certain locations would receive the smallest doses, and tha t, if they improvise additional shielding in these locations, the doses received could be greatly reduced. Additional shielding can be provided by pl acing a double layer of doors, positioned about two feet above the floor and strongly supported near their ends, and by putting books, containers f ull of water and other heavy objects on top of these doors. Or, if tools a re available, breaking through the basement floor and digging a shelter tr ench will greatly increase available protection against radiation. If a second expedient ventilating pump, a KAP, is made and used as a fan, such an extremely cramped shelter inside a shelter usually can be occ upied by several times as many persons.
