The Trilateral Commission was founded in 1973 by New York banker David Rockefeller, then Chairman of Chase Manhat- tan Bank, and Harvard University academic Zbignieuw Brzezinski, later to become Na tional Security Assistant to President Jimmy Carter. What it is depends on one's viewpoint. According to the Trilateral Commission itself: The Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by pri- vate citizens of Western Europe, Japan and North America to foster closer cooperation among these three regions on common problems. It seeks to improve public understanding of such problems, to support proposals for handling them jointly, and to nurture habits and prac- tices of working together among these regions. However, in populist political ci rcles the Trilateral Commis- sion is a transparent device to achieve New World Order, which sound suspiciously like other dictatorial \"World Orders.\" From this viewpoint Trilaterals are enemies of freedom and intent on gaining a monopoly of world political power for their own benefit. Twenty years ago the Trilateral Commission had very little history; one could not track its intentions from its actions."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Today, in 1994, one can look at 20 years of Trilateral history and more accurately assess their objectives in the light of past political acti ons and member appointments to various Administrations. The original 1972 membership chosen by Rockefeller and Brzezinski comprised about 200 members worldwide of whom about one-third were North Am ericans, one-third Europeans and one-third Japanese. In 1993 this had expanded to about 325 members worldwide, termed \"distinguished citizens\" by the Trilateral Commission but in fact representing an extremely narrow spectrum of world opinion and culture and completely unelected or repres entative of anything but David Rockefeller's personal views. From the start the Commission has been termed \"private\" and \"unofficial\" with the stated objective to \"draw together the highest level unofficial group possible to look together at the common problems facing our three areas\" and to \"foster cooperation.\" Throughout Trilateral Commi ssion's reporting one finds a consistent confusion between \"private\" and \"public.\" The Commission is promoted as a private group founded by a private citizen. David Rockefe ller. Yet its objectives and operations are public policy oriented. In the words of the Trilateral Commission: The full Commission gathers once each yearâ€”in Lisbon in 1992, in Washington in 1993, in Tokyo in 1994. In addition to special topi cal sessions and reviews of current developments in our regions, a substantial portion of each annual meeting is devoted to considera- tion of draft reports to th e Commission. These reports are generally the joint product of authors from each of the three regions who draw on a range of consultants in the course of their work. P ublication follows discussion in the Commission's annual meeting. The authors are solely responsible for their final text. A separate publication contains the prin cipal presentations at the annual meeting. Occasionally informal papers appear from regional activities. 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Each regional group has a Chairman and Deputy Chairman, who all together constitute the leadership of the Commission. The Executive Committee draws together a further 36 individuals from the wider membership. In brief, this group of private citizens is precisely organized in a manner that ensures its collective views have significant impact on public policy. They meet, they review, they discuss, they report and after this discussion make their recommenda- tions public. For what purpose? The Trilateral Commission would hardly expend all this energy and funding for an academic exercise. . the objective has to be to establish public policy objectives to be implemented by governments worldwide. Further, the members are not elected. . they are chosen. The Chairman of the Execu tive Committee, the committee that chooses members, is David Rockefeller, who is also founder and Chairman of the overall Trilateral Commission. The entire structure reflects Rockefeller choices, not impartial or representative choices. This phenomenon of a David Ro ckefeller front organization has not been lost on observers. On July 27,1979, radio station KLMG, Council Bluffs, Iowa, ran an interview of George Franklin, then Coordinator of the Trilateral Commission. This author was a guest on the program. Here from the transcript is how Franklin answered the question of Rockefeller influence. C OMMENTATOR : Why is it, in the Trilateral Commission that the name David Rockefeller shows up so persis- tently, or [the name of] one of his organizations? F RANKLIN : Well, this is very reasonable. David Rocke- feller is the Chairman of the North American group. There are three chairmen: one is [with] the North American group, one is [with] the Japanese group, and one is [with] the European group. Also, the Commission was really David Rockefeller's original idea. 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Franklin is aware of the Rockefeller criticism and tries to pass it off as unimportant, as \"reasonable.\" The fact that Rocke- feller is personally involved with member selection suggests that the Commission was formed to advance family or personal objectives. If not, then Rockefeller would have allowed others to make such choices. The commentator then switches the discussion to the then current Carter Administration, in which co-founder Zbignieuw Brzezinski is National Security adviser to Carter and numerous other Trilatera ls had been appointed. C OMMENTATOR : On President Carter's staff, how many Trilateral Commission members do you have? F RANKLIN : Eighteen. C OMMENTATOR : Don't you think that is rather heavy? F RANKLIN : It is quite a lot, yes. C OMMENTATOR : Don't you think it is rather unusual? How many members are there actually in the Trilateral Commission? F RANKLIN : We have 77 in the United States? C OMMENTATOR : Don't you think it is rather unusual to have 18 members on the Carter staff? F RANKLIN : Yes, I think we chose some very able people when we started the Commission. The President happens to think well of quite a number of them. This author then pursued with Franklin the question of mem- bership choice and Rockefeller in fluence. Franklin denies the obvious. It is obvious to any reasonable person that the Tri- lateral Commission is a Rockefeller organization formed to advance his interest and that it most certainly has significant influence. Influence is the raison d'etre for the Trilateral Commission. S UTTON : D O you believe that the only able people in the United States are Trilateralists? F RANKLIN : Of course not. F RANKLIN : Well, when we started to choose members, we 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"did try to pick out the ablest people we could and I think many of those that are in the Carter Administration would have been chosen by any group that was inter- ested in the foreign policy question. S UTTON : Would you say that you have an undue influ- ence on policy in the United States? F RANKLIN : I would not, no. S UTTON : I think any reasonable man would say that if you have 18 Trilateralists out of 77 in the Carter Admini- stration you have a preponderant influence. F RANKLIN : These men are not responsive to anything that the Trilateral Commission might advocate. We do have about two reports we put out each year and we do hope they have some influence or we would not put them out. S UTTON : May I ask another question? F RANKLIN : Yes. S UTTON : Who financed the Trilateral Commission originally? F RANKLIN : Uhh. . . The first supporter of all was a foundation called the Kettering Foundation. I can tell you who is financing it at the present time, which might be of more interest to you. S UTTON : I S it not the Rockefeller Brothers' Fund? F RANKLIN : The Rockefeller Brothers' Fund? The North American end of the Commission needs $1.5 million over the next three years. Of this amount, $180,000 will be contributed by the Rockefeller Brothers' Fund and $150,000 by David Rockefeller. C OMMENTATOR : Does that mean that most of it is being financed by the Rockefellers? F RANKLIN : N O , it means that about one-fifth of the North American end is being financed by the Rockefellers and none of the European and Japanese end Moreover, the Rockefeller family had long-standing interests 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in several public policy organizations of highly significant influence. The Trilateral Commission only extended the work and influence of the Council on Foreign Relations chaired for many years by the self-same David Rockefeller. Another Rockefeller family-sponsored and financed group was the Commission on Critical Choices whose task was to identify the \"critical choices\" facing the United States at the turn of the 21st Century. On ce again we have a commission appointed by the Rockefellers, to decide what is best for all Americans. T HE C OMMISSION ON C RITICAL C HOICES F OR A MERICANS is a nationally representative, bipartisan group of 42 prominent Americans, brought together under the chair- manship of Nelson A. Rockefeller. Their assignment: To identify the critical choices which will confront America as it embarks on its third century as a nation and to determine the realistic and desirable objectives this nation can achieve by 1895 and the year 2000. The Commission was established in the American tra- dition of voluntary effort. It is 42 citizens who have joined together to help determine the facts about the future of America. Because of the complexity and interdependence of issues facing the world today, the Commission organ- ized its work into six study panels, which emphasize the interrelationships of the critical choices rather than studying each one separately. The six study panels are: Panel I â€” Energy and Its Relationship to Ecology, Economics and World Stability; Panel II â€” Food, Health, World Population and Quality of Life; Panel III â€” Raw Materials, Industrial Development, Capital Formation, Employment and World Trade. Panel IV â€” International Trade and Monetary Systems, Inflation and the Relationships Among Differing Economic Systems; Panel V â€” Change, National Security and Peace, and 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Panel VI â€” Quality of Life of Indi viduals and Communities in the U.S.A. In brief, the Commission is a Rockefeller study group, funded in large part by a Rockefeller organization. The Third Century Corporat ion, a New York not-for- profit organization, was created to finance the work of the Commission. Since the star t of its activ ities in the fall of 1973, the Corporation has received contributions and pledges from individuals and from foundations well- known for their support of public interest activities. The Drive for New World Order While publically portrayed as a high level discussion group, the Trilateral Commission is dedicated to New World Order. The most comprehensive statemen t of New World Order is to be found in Trilateral co-f ounder Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era, published just before the Trilater al Commission was founded. This book is the blueprint for a \"more just and equitable world order.\" In one sense it is not much different to scores of other plans for political contro l that go back to Greek times and include More's Utopia, Karl Marx, V.I. Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Mao... all are schemas for political control. The only document in history th at has rigidly defined and restrained government control is the Constitution of the United States, unique because it limits government power. Brzezinski's book dismisses the Constitution... for the same reasons that all other politic al documents have dismissed freedom, i.e. because it is \"inadequate.\" However, Brzezinski's rejection of the Constitution is on unique groundsâ€”\"the age cannot bear the problems of assimilating the old into the new\"â€”yet many of the problems are created by the self-same Trilateral members who now propose solutions. According to Brzezinski mankind has moved through three states of evolution and we are now in the middle of the fourth 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"and final state. In some ways the secular Brzezinski analysis is parallel to Jose Arguelles' The Mayan Factor, a mystical calendar of the world divided into periods. According to The Mayan Factor, our world is also presently in the final stages of dissolution, culminating in 2012 when it passes to higher levels of consciousness. Back to Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilatera l Commission. The first global stage is described as \"religious\" and combines \"a heavenly universalism provided by acceptance of the idea that man's destiny is essentia lly in God's hands\" with an \"earthly narrowness derived from massive ignorance, illiteracy and a vision confined to the immediate environment.\" The second stage is nationalis m, and defined as \"another giant step in the progressive re definition of man's nature and place in our world.\" In Arguelles this is paralleled as \"materialism.\" The materialist philosophy of Marxism comprises the third stage. For Brzezinski \"this represents a further vital and creative stage in the measuring of man's universal vision.\" Neither David Rockefeller nor Zbignieuw Brzezinski cite the technological and moral wea knesses and excesses of Marx- ism. They view it as \"creativ e\" and a signifi cant factor in man's maturity. In reality, â€” and history has now demonstrated what some of us argued for years â€” Marxism is a hollow sham, a gigantic con job, a device for New York cap italists to control a country through technology and debt wh ile pretending the opposite. It was American trade unions , especially under Samuel Gompers and George Meany, th at recognized the phoniness of Marxism. Wall Street and many academics who should have known better were the promot ers, allies and apologizers for Marxism. Capitalists, because a monopoly state offers the opportunity of monopoly market s and monopoly profits with- out any uncomfortable criticism from the street. Academics, because Wall Street-financed Un iversities offer opportunities for self-advancement a nd self-aggrandisement. After Marxism, according to Brzezinski, comes the fourth and final stage, the Technetron ic Era or the idea of rational 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"humanism on a global scale, the result of American- Communist cooperation. Here is the Brzezinski view of the contemporary structure which is a tortured framework to present a supposed requirement for a New World Order political structure: Tension is unavoidable as man strives to assimilate the new into the framework of the old. For a time the established framework resili ently integrates the new by adapting it in a more familiar shape. But at some point the old framework becomes overloaded The new input can no longer be redefined into traditional forms, and eventually it asserts itself w ith compelling force. Today, though, the old framework of international politics â€” with their spheres of influence, military alliances between nation-states, the fiction of sovereignty, doctrinal conflicts arising from nineteenth century crises â€” is clearly no longer compatible with reality. Interestingly the Brzezinski estimate of change is significantly in error and this error will undoubtedly affect the nature of the world to come. New World Order is not inevitable. Firstly, the current trend is towards small political units reflecting ethnic and national groups. Within the United States we have proposals fo r independent States and to divide States into two or three segments as large units become ungovernable and \"overloaded.\" The framework is \"overloaded\" but the reaction is smaller units, not larger, ungovernable units. This is precisely the opposite reaction proposed by the Trilateral Commission. Secondly, when it comes to \"rational humanism\" Brzez- inski is again way off contemporary evolvement. Religion is coming back and in a more spiritual form. The older churches, institutionalized churches, are suffering losses, particularly the 2000-year-old Catholic ch urch. However, there is a revival of religion through modern technol ogy, i.e. radio churches and TV evangelists. Further there is a spiritual evolvement of extraordinary proportions in non-traditional forms such as 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"meditation and communal group s. Some of these groups, such as the Church Universal and Triumphant in Montana, are now established and accepted by traditional areas. This is a far cry from \"humanism\" and non-religion! How- ever, it is in technology that we find departures from the \"new world\" proposed by Brzezinski and adopted by David Rocke- feller and the Trilateral Comm ission. The technology of the future has an emerging spiritual component. The physics of the future, post-high energy physics and the vacuum energy physics of the 21st century is also a spiritual technology. The Eastern concepts of Buddhism a nd the material world are to an extent merging with the vacuum physics of the West, Zen and western physics are mergi ng in a manner that confounds the ideas of the Trilateral Co mmission. Agreed that this new input cannot be defined in tradit ional terms, in this limited manner Brzezinski is correct bu t the new framework is not a rigid New World Order. Pa radoxically. New World Order turns out to be a reflection of the old traditional framework! Brzezinski and Rockefeller propos e to replace the old frame- work with a new framework. . but one under their control. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO: MEMBERSHIP OF THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION The interesting aspect of Trilateralism is that it brings to- gether the Administrators of power rather than the Holders of power. David Rockefeller is essentially the only power center in the entire Trilateral catalog. Politicians, lawyers, bureaucrats, media types, trade unionists come and go in the Trilateral halls of power â€” they are tr ansient administrators. They retain administrative positions only as long as they are successful in using political power to gain political objectives. Operators do not, by and large, create objectives â€” this is an important point. One should label this group of operators \"the hired hands.\" As Senator Mansfield once said of Con- gress, \"To get along, you must go along.\" Trilateral operators are at the pinnacle of success in \"going along.\" In the 1970's, nine of the American Trilateral commis- sioners were Establishment lawy ers, from highly influential major law firms. The \"revolving door\" area between so-called public service and priv ate gain, where attorneys alternate be- tween private practice and the federal payroll, clouds more precise identification. For some reason, two of the nine lawyers were partners in the Los Angeles law firm O'Melveny & Myers: senior partner, William T. Coleman Jr. (also a director of David Rockefelle r's Chase Manhattan Bank and a 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"former Transportation Secretary): and Warren Christopher, who was a partner from 1958-67 and from 1969 until joining Carter's regime as Deputy Secretary of State, and Clinton's as Secretary of State in 1993. In 1994 William T. Coleman Jr., now a senior partner in O'Melveny & Myers, had already been Secretary of Transpor- tation, was still a Trilateralist and indeed a member of the exclusive Trilateral Executive Committee. From the same law firm of O'Melveny & Myers in 1994 Warren Christopher had become Secretary of State after serving as Co-Director of President Clinton's Transition team, amid strong protests that he was not looking for any personal appointment. Christophe r did an outstanding job for the Trilaterals, appointing no fewer than 22 fellow members to the Clinton Administration that emphasized the \"old way of doing business\" could not c ontinue. No doubt Christopher will return to O'Melveny & Myers after his term as Secretary of State, to continue the wheeling and dealing business. Moreover, this political influence duo is now joined in 1994 by yet another partner in O'Melveny & Myers, Ko-Yung- Tung, Chairman of the firm's New York-based Global Practice Group. So this almost unknown Los Ange les law firm is in reality an influence-peddling outfit of the first category. This Trilateral trio highlights the cozy revolving door political influence game that makes a mockery of a free society. O'Melveny & Myers together with Kissinger & Associates and the Carlyle Group have a lock on political influence â€” and all just happen to be linked to the Trilateral Commission. George Franklin, former Executive Secretary of the Commis- sion, avers, this is a mere statistical accident, all talent just accidentally happens to be within the Trilateral Commission, that we shouldn't be concerned; in fact, according to Franklin, we should be grateful that such eminent ladies and gentlemen are willing to accept the burdens of \"public service.\" So how does this political influence game work? We'll suppose you're out there in Zaire or the Argentine and you want some U.S. taxpayer dollars â€” to build a bridge or \"fight 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"drugs,\" anything in fact that gives you opportunity to skim a little gravy off the top for your own hardworking self â€” what do you do? You head for Trilateral Mr. Ko-Yung-Tung, the O'Melveny & Myers man in New York, or Trilateral Henry Kissinger at Kissinger Associates, or former Secretary of Defense Trilateral Frank Carlucci at The Carlyle Group â€” all with excellent Trilateral connections and â€” for a substantial, very substantial, fee â€” they will take your case to Washington. And do you believe for one mi nute that some small time Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who makes routine $100 million aid decisions is going to look the other way when Henry, or Frank, or Yung-Tu ng telephone about the pitiful needs of Zaire or the Argentine? After all, a Deputy Assistant Secretary has ambitions one day of becoming a full-fledged Assistant Secretary and will need a few kind words from prominent persons. So the decisions on Zaire or the Argentine are not made with the interests of the United States taxpayer in mind but by what is termed elegantly as \"political factors.\" Now contrast this con game with the many thousands of American citizens who suffered from U.S. radiation experiments in the 1940's and 1950's. They want compen- sation but have to go to court to try to get just compensation from the Department of Energy. The American in the street can't call up Henry Kissinger or Frank Carlucci or Ko-Yung- Tung (as can the Zairian Embassy or an Argentinian Senator). Poor Joe Blow has to use his limited funds to challenge a Department of Energy with unlimited taxpayer funds to fight its own citizens. This is what Trilateralism is all about. It's not about the Technetronic Age which is a long word about nothing and indeed if Brzezinski couldn't see the coming downfall of the Soviet Union, he can't be relied upon to for see the nature of the coming era. Trilateralism may be clothed in fancy lan- guage but it boils down to the exercise of political power in the interests of the Trilaterals and their associates. If you swallow the coy phrase \"public service\" then you shouldn't be reading 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"this book. It's more like institutionalized ripoff. So you complain to Congress?

In the 1970's, of five media commis- sioners, three were relatively insignificant: Doris Anderson, editor of Chatelaine Magazine; Carl Rowan, columnist, and Arthur R. Taylor, formerly head of the CBS network, dismissed in October 1976. Two media Trilaterals were highly influential: Emmett Dedmon, editorial director of the Chicago Sun-Times, published by Field Enterprises. The chairman of Field Enterprises, Inc., Marshall Field V, also a director of First National Bank of Chicago, operates Field Enterprises under an exhaustive agreement with his half brother, \"Ted,\" Frederick W. Field; and Field ownership is significant because of Trilateral connecti ons with the First National Bank of Chicago. In any event, Chicago Sun Times is the sixth largest newspaper in the U.S. (daily circulation 687,000). Another influential media Trilateralist was Hedley Donovan, editor-in-chief of Time, member of the Council on Foreign Relations and director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. According to the U.S. Labor Party: Donovan played a central role in the \"faking of the President, 1976.\" Under his Trilateral direction, Time functioned as a black propaganda vehicle throughout the campaign and post-election period, painting Carter as an \"outsider\" with no connections with the corrupt politics of Washington, D.C. and Wall Street This \"image build- ing\" provided the crucial cover for the planned vote fraud, and Time played a crucial coverup role as widespread evidence of the Nov. 2 fraud surfaced. Trilateral disdain for the First Amendment is a factor working strongly against generally sympathetic media attention. On the other hand, Trilateralist intervention in day-to-day media operation, by use of the traditional tele- phone call, is probable, given the numerous Trilateral corporate directors in the media: Henry B.

Their presence is ominous. However, any persistent interv ention to kill or re-orient stories will backfire. Most media people are professionals rather than propagandists. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, supposedly a public institution, has always had a heavy Trilateral bias. This reflects the blurring of public and private which Trilaterals exercise so well for their own advantages. Sharon Percy Rockefeller, wife of Commissioner John D. Rockefeller IV, former Governor, now Senator from West Virginia, is an example of this link. More emphatic is the funding of the PBS heavyweight programs which mold public opinion by Trilateral-oriented and Trilateral-represented firms. Robert C. Wenks, a Trilateral in 1994, is also Chairman of Prudential Securities, Inc. and finances \"Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser,\" and you will never hear Rukeyser criticize the Federal Reserve private banking monopoly or argue gold as the only stable basis for a monetary system. \"Tony Brown's Journal\" on PBS is funded by Pepsi-Cola, a major Trilateral-linked firm with at least one or two directors always on the Trilateral Commissi on. Pepsi is one of the gung ho New World Order firms and as you will remember, was first into Communist China and only second after Coca Cola into Soviet Russia. The famous MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour is financed by Archer Daniels Midland, a global corporation with Trilateral Dwayne Andreas as Chairman. Pepsi Cola also finances MacNeil Lehrer.

In 1993 President Bill Clinton and Vice President Albert Gore were Trilaterals. It should be emphasized that selection by the Trilateral Commission was long before they became residents of the White House. Interestingly, President Jimmy Carter was selected and promoted by none other than Trilateral President David Rockefeller. In 1992 the Trilatera l backing was more discreet for Bill Clinton because of previ ous public criticism of the Tri- lateral Commission for its dominant influence. Here's how T HE T IMES (London) reported the Rockefeller- Carter linkup: Governor Jimmy Carter, the 1976 Democratic Presi- dential candidate, has for reasons known only to himself professed to be an innocent abroad, but the record is somewhat different. As Gove rnor of Georgia, a state aspiring to be the centre of the New South, he led the state trade missions abroad. While in London in the autumn of 1973 he dined with another American visitor, but by no means an innocent, Mr. David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank. Mr. Rockefeller was then establishing, with the help of Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski of Columbia University, an international study gr oup now known as the Tri- lateral Commission, He was looking for American mem- bers outside the usual catchment area of universities, corporation law firms and government, was impressed by the Governor, if only becau se he had ventured abroad, and invited him to join. Governor Carter, perhaps because he was already eyeing the White House from afar, was only too happy to accept. This enlightening statement in T HE T IMES has one significant error. The Trilateral Commission is no \"inter- national Study group\" â€” it is cl early a group that generates policies and tries to ensure that its own Trilateral Com- missioners have a role in implementing the policies. A study 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"group would not place one-third of its members in Administration after Administration, both Republican and Democrat. This is, T HE T IMES to the contrary, an operating group working towards specific self-centered objectives. The Congress Senators and Congressmen are members of the Trilateral Commission, which, given the negative belittling Trilateral view of the Congress, is somewhat surprising. On the other hand, modern politicians in the \"Best Congress that money can Buy\" have little trouble accommodating inconsistent policies providing the price is right â€” for them. Trilateralists also occupy key posts in the House, i.e., chairman of the House Repub lican Conference, majority whip, chairman of the Democratic Conference, and chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. In sum, Trilaterals have a lock on the legislative process. The significance of this lock on the legislative process is brought into focus when we ex amine the political ideology of Trilateralism as expressed by Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki in T HE C RISIS OF D EMOCRACY . â€¢ The democratic political system no longer has any purpose. â€¢ The concepts of equality and individualism give problems to authority. â€¢ The media is not sufficiently subservient to the elite. â€¢ Democracy has to be \"balanced\" (i.e. restricted). â€¢ The authority and power of the central government must be increased Weighing these totalitarian ideas which form the poli- tical philosophy of the commission against congressional membership in the Trilateral Commission, the reader will be tempted to ask, were these the political policies espoused by these politicians when elected to office?

Trilaterals in the Clinton Administration All Administrations since the Carter Administration have contained an unusually large number of Trilateral members.

As Executive Director George Fr anklin Jr. stated back in 1978, the Trilateral Commission invites only members with New World Order viewpoints and goals. President Bill Clinton then is an ideal member, unusually so because his entire career has been formed under tutelage and guidance of New World Order advocates. (See JBS Bulletin, October 1992). Clinton has a B.S. in International Affairs from George- town University in 1968, where he studied under Carroll Quigley, whose famous Tragedy and Hope had been published in 1966. Quig ley broke the story of an elitist British group financed by the Rothschilds and Cecil Rhodes, whose ambition was to run the world. Rhodes founded the Rhodes 24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"scholarships at Oxford University â€” and Clinton, a devout disciple of the New World Orde r message, was given a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University. There is another side to the Quigley story which is little known, and we are aware of it b ecause this author had some correspondence with Quigley about Tragedy and Hope. Quigley sincerely believed in New World Order but was not aware of the darker side of the globalist types until they refused to reprint his book and destroyed the plates; Quigley was alerting too many honest academics and citizens to the dark side of New World Or der. The difference between Quigley and Clinton is morality. We know that Quigley was an honest academician, a little naive, genuinely puzzled why the Establishment wanted the secrets in Tragedy and Hope kept secret. Clinton, on the other hand, quickly learned the political power profit lessons of the New World Order, in the tradition of Rothschild and Rhodes. Consequently, while Quigley died a puzzled man, B ill Clinton has been supported at every turn of the road (until early 1994) by the Trilaterals and their fellows to gain a reputation of deceit and devious- ness unequalled by any past President of the United States. As we write this (January 1994) Clinton is in trouble. We even hear rumors that he is ta rgeted for political destruction and will be succeeded by another Trilateralist, former Mayor of San Francisco, now Senator Di anne Feinstein. But make no mistake, the Trilaterals have a firm hold on the Presidency and will continue to bring their influence to bear on its occupant. 25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE: NEW WORLD ORDER AS THE OBJECTIVE Run your eye down the list of executive committee members:* who is the most powerful individual among them? There is no doubt that David Rockefeller dominates the executive committee, and thus th e commission itself. Even if we are generous (or naive) and see the executive members as equals, then David would surely be primus inter pares. It is, however, naive to see David Rockefeller as an omnipotent dictator or the Rockefeller family as an all-powerful monarchy. This is a trap for the unwary. Our world is much more complex. We are looking at a family of families, a collective of power holders w ith at least several hundred, perhaps several thousand, member s, who collectively aim to divert the world, not just the United States, to their own collective objectives. Let's start at the beginning. The Trilateral Commission was David Rockefeller's idea and promoted with David's funds. (Leave aside for the time being the U.S. Labor party theory that Trilateralism uses the Rockefellers as a \"cover\" for a \"British conspiracy.\") An interview with George S. Franklin, former commission coordinator, by Michael Lloyd Chadwick, editor of The Freemen Digest, published in Provo, Utah, is the most authentic version of the f ounding process which has yet * See Appendix A, p. 142 27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"surfaced. This portion of the interview follows: M R . C HADWICK : Mr. Franklin, you were a participant with Mr. David Rockefeller, Robert Bowie, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Owen in forming the Trilateral Commission. Would you provide us with a brief history of how it came into existence? M R . F RANKLIN : David Rockefeller, in the winter and spring of 1972, gave several speeches to the Chase Bank forums in London, Brussels, Montreal and Paris. He recommended the establishment of an international com- mission on peace and prosperity which in fact is now the Trilateral Commission. He didn't receive an enthusiastic response in these meetings and he dropped the idea. He thought, \"If the Chase Bank Forums don 't respond favor- ably to my suggestion then it's probably a lousy idea.\" He then went to a Bilderberger meeting. Mike Blumen- thal was there (now Treasury Secretary), and he said, \"You know, I'm very disturbed. . . Cooperation between these three areas â€” Japan, the United States and Western Europe â€” is really falling apart, and I foresee all sorts of disaster for the world if this continues. Isn't there anything to be done about it? \"David then thought, \"I'll present the idea once more,\" which he did, and he aroused great enthusiasm. The next eight speakers said that this was a marvelous idea; by all means, somebody get it launched David wasn't quite sure whether these were all his friends. He wasn't quite sure if they were being polite or if they really thought it was a good idea. So he took Zbig Brezinski back on the plane with him. Zbig thought it was a very good idea and had done some writing on it. Bob Bowie had done some writing on it too. When he got back, David asked me if I would go back to Europe and talk to some people more at leisure and see if they really thought this was a good idea They truly did David and I went to Japan in June of 1972 and he talked to a lot of people there. They thought it was a good 28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"idea, so we had a meeting of 13-15 people at his place in Tarrytown (ed: New York). It was decided to go ahead and try to organize and form it There is no reason to doubt th at formation came about in any other way â€” at least we have no evidence that Franklin is hiding anything. But note that the way the Trilateral Com- mission was founded suggests a loose power coalition, some- times in competition, sometimes in cooperation, rather than a small, tight, iron-fisted conspi racy run by the Rockefellers. But even the establishment Washington Post has found unsettling features about the Trilateral Commission in its current seemingly non-interested packaging. Consequently it is not surprisi ng that Trilater al objectives are not shouted from the rooftops but inferred from policy statements, papers and positions as well as the personal philosophies of those chosen as members of the Commission. Here's the Washington Post observation: Trilateralists are not thr ee-sided people. They are members of a private, though not secret, international organization put together by the wealthy banker, David Rockefeller, to stimulate the establishment dialogue between Western Europe, Japan and the United States. But here is the unsettling thing about the Trilateral Commission. The President-elect is a member. So is Vice- President-elect Walter F. Mondale. So are the new Secre- taries of State, Defense a nd Treasury, Cyrus R. Vance, Harold Brown and W. Michael Blumenthal. So is Zbig- niew Brzezinski, who is a former Trilateral director and, Carter's national security advi ser, also a bunch of others who will make foreign policy for America in the next four years. No doubt this Washington Po st observation was brought to the attention of David Rockefeller because by the 1990s the publisher of the Washingt on Post, Katherine Graham (Chairman of the Board of Wa shington Post Companies) had been appointed to the Trilateral Commission! 29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Even though Trilateral control has continued, the Wash- ington Post has made no more remarks about \"unsettling things.\" This was the White House com position in the early 70s. It remains the same today, in 1994, a heavily Trilateral membership. President Bill Clinton is a Trila teral as was President Jimmy Carter. Secretary of State Warre n Christopher is an original member of the Trilateral Co mmission. So are 22 other mem- bers of the Clinton Cabinet and sub-cabinet Administration. The personal philosophies of Carter appointees are similar to that of Clinton. . . they all adhere more or less to a global New World Order. Where, for example, President Truman was non-imperialist, these are imperialist Presidents. From speeches and letters written by Trilateralists we know their New World Order position. When the Trilateral Commissi on met in Tokyo, Japan, in January 1977. Carter and Br zezinski obviously could not attend as they were still in the process of reorganizing the White House. They did, however , address personal letters to the meeting, which were reprinted in Trialogue: It gives me special pleasure to send greetings to all of you gathering for the Trilateral Commission meeting in Tokyo. I have warm memories of our meeting in Tokyo some eighteen months ago, and am sorry I cannot be with you now. My active service on the Commission since its incep- tion in 1973 has been a sple ndid experience for me, and it provided me with excellent opportunities to come to know leaders in our three regions. As I emphasized in my cam paign, a strong partner- ship among us is of the greatest importance. We share economic, political and security concerns that make it logical we should seek ever-increasing cooperation and understanding. And this coope ration is essential not only for our three regions, but in the global search for a more just and equitable world order (emphasis added). I hope to see you on the occasion of your next meeting in 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Washington, and I look forward to receiving reports on your work in Tokyo.\" Jimmy Carter Brzezinski's letter, written in a similar vein, follows: The Trilateral Commission ha s meant a great deal to me over the last few years. It has been the stimulus for intellectual creativity and a source of personal satis- faction. I have formed close ties with new friends and colleagues in all three regions , ties which I value highly and which I am sure will continue. I remain convinced that, on the larger architectural issues of today, collaboration among our regions is of the utmost necessity. This collabo ration must be dedicated to the fashioning of a more just and equitable world order (emphasis added). Th is will require a prolonged process, but I think we can look forward with confidence and take some pride in the contribution which the Com- mission is making. Zbigniew Brzezinski The key phrase in both letters is \"a more just and equitable world order.\" Does this emphasis indicate that something is wrong with our present world order, that is, with national structures? Yes, according to Brzezinski; and since the present \"framework\" is inadequate to handle world problems, it must be done away with and supplanted with a world government. In Brzezinski's Technetronic Er a, the \"nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multi- national corporations are acti ng and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state.\" Understanding the philosophy of and monitoring the Tri- lateral commission is the only way we can reconcile the myriad of apparent contradictions in the information filtered through to us in the national pr ess. For instance, how is it 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"that the Marxist regime in Angola derived the great bulk of its foreign exchange from the offshore oil operations of Gulf Oil Corporation? Why did Andrew Young insist that \"Com- munism has never been a threat to Blacks in Africa\"? Why did the U.S. funnel billions in technological aid to the Soviet Union and Communist China? Why does the U.S. apparently help its enemies while chastising its friends? These questions, and hundreds of others like them, cannot be explained in any other way: the U.S. Executive Branch (and related agencies) is not anti-Marxist or anti-Communist â€” it is, in fact, pro-Marxist. Those ideals which led to the abuses of Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, and Mussolini are now being accepted as necessary inevitab ilities by our elected and appointed leaders. This hardly suggests the Great American Dream. It is very doubtful that Americans would agree with Brzezinski or the Trilateral Commission. It is the American public who is paying the price, suffering the consequences, but not understanding the true nature of the situation. One of the most important \"frameworks\" in the world, and especially to Americans, is th e United States Constitution. It is this document that outlined the most prosperous nation in the history of the world. Is our sovereignty really \"fiction\"? Is the U.S. vision no longer compatible with reality? Brzezinski further states: The approaching two-hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence could justify the call for a national constitutional conven tion to re-examine the nation's formal institutional framework. Either 1976 or 1989 â€” the two-hundredth anniversary of the Constitu- tion â€” could serve as a suitable target date culminating a national dialogue on the rele vance of existing arrange- ments. . . .Realism, however, forces us to recognize that the necessary political innovation will not come from direct constitutional reform, desirable as that would be. The needed change is more likely to develop incremen- tally and less overtly. . . in keeping with the American tradition of blurring distinctions between public and 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"private institution. Obviously Brzezinski, and global capitalists have no use for national sovereignty or the C onstitution. Their interests are global â€” and much as they may protest we see no difference between Trilateral globalism and, for example, British and French imperialism of the 19th Century. Or the Holy Roman Empire for that matter. But this New World Order objective would not pass an elec- torate. Outside the globalists, the New World Order fanatics, we doubt that many in the United States are interested in a planned world economy under the dominance of Wall Street. In conclusion, the Trilateral Commission when pressed makes no secret of its unrepresentative nature nor its New World Order objectives. Back in 1978 in the previously cited radio interview with George Franklin Jr., then Executive Director of the Trilateral Commission, these objectives emerged under questioning from the author: S UTTON : Mr. Donovan, of Time-Life, has just been appointed Special Assistant to President Carter. Mr. Donovan is a member of your Commission. F RANKLIN : That is correct. S UTTON : Does this not emphasize the fact that the Carter Administration is choosing its administration from an extremely narrow range. In other words, the Trilateral Commission? F RANKLIN : I do not think that that needs any confirma- tion. That is a matter of fact that he has chosen most of his main foreign policy people, I would have to say, from the people he got to know while he was on the Trilateral Commission. S UTTON : Well, I can only make the statement that this leaves any reasonable man with the impression that the Carter Administration is dominated by the Trilateral Commission with your specific ideas which many people do not agree with. F RANKLIN : Well, I would certainly agree that people who were members of the Commission have predominant 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"places in the foreign policy aspects of the Carter Administration. They are not, because they are members of the Commission, controlled in any sense by us. I do think that they do share a common belief that is very important that we work particularly with Europe and Japan or we are all going to be in trouble. S UTTON : But this common belief may not reflect the beliefs of the American people. How do you know that it does? F RANKLIN : I do not know that it does. I am no man to interpret what the people think about. S UTTON : In other words, you are quite willing to go ahead (and) establish a Commission which you say does not necessarily reflect the views of the poeple in the United States? It appears to me that you have taken over poli- tical power. F RANKLIN : I do not think this is true at all. Anybody who forms a group for certain purposes obviously tries to achieve these purposes. We do believe that it is impor- tant that Europe, Japan, and the United States get along together. That much we do believe. We also chose the best people we could get as members of the Commission. Fortunately, nearly all accepted The President was one of them and he happened to have thought that these were very able people indeed, and he asked them to be in his government, it is as simple as that. If you are going to ask me if I am very unhappy about that, the answer is no. I think that these are good people. The reader can make his or he r own interpretation. We hold the view today in 1994 that we held in 1973 and 1978 (the date of the radio program) â€” that the Trilateral Commission is not representative of the United States, has clearly by its actions demonstrated that it is a group intent on manipulating power for personal advantage and that these actions or objectives are not those of American citizens â€” and the Trilateral Commission has no intention of putting the matter to a vote. Quod etat demonstrandum. 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR: POLICIES FOR MONOPOLY CONTROL The unstated concealed Trilateral policy is global power and influence, a policy best achie ved by financial control. The dedicated interest of the Rockefeller family and international bankers in world order, world planning, global problems is the sure indicator that they unders tand how political control can be translated into dollars and cents. Trilaterals, one of several el itist organizations for global control, have organized influe nce peddling companies headed by their own Trilateral buddies. These grease the way more or less legally between government contracts and corporate contracts. Anti-lobbying laws are so devious ly written and so easy to circumnavigate that in practi ce they do no more than con- vince the public that government contracts are intended to be influence free. The reality is that the revolving door is significantly con- trolled by Trilaterals and completely controlled by elitists, if we include the influence of su ch organizations as Council on Foreign Relations (long-time Chairman was David Rocke- feller) and Yale Skull and Bones (with members such as George Bush, Averell Harriman and other government movers and shakers). One well-known conduit for government business using in- sider influence is Kissinger Associates. Trilateral Henry 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Kissinger, founder and Chairman of Kissinger Associates, is former Assistant for National S ecurity Affairs and a former U.S. Secretary of State. As such, Kissinger was able to acquire and use worldwide contacts and a thorough know- ledge of the contact-contract world. Kissinger & Associates charges gl obal corporations substan- tial fees to act on their behalf within and without the United States. Kissinger uses his infl uence, earned and gained at US. taxpayer expense, to push th e cause of his clients. This is, of course, influence peddli ng, but apparently legal because the loopholes written in to the laws are big enough to drive a truck through and will remain that way until the voting public demands that politics be separated from personal finance. A more recent influence peddling outfit is the Carlyle Group, subject of a scathing and well-written article in the New Republic (October 18, 1993). A ccording to this article, the Carlyle Group was founded by David Rubenstein, a minor league former merchant banker, and named after the New York Hotel Carlyle. The Hotel Carlyle is a l ong-time corporate hangout. (We once visited one of the suites and found it to be a dismal, solidly-furnished building used by global wheeler dealers for private business.) The Carlyle Group according to New Republic holds a majority stake in firms that do business with the United States Government. Day-to-day operations are conducted by former Secretary of Defense Fr ank Carlucci, a Trilateralist whose entire stock of expertise consists of whom he knows in Governent and how Government wheels mesh together. Among members of the Carlyle Group are former Secretary of State James Baker, a close friend of former President George Bush, former Budget Director Richard Darman, Trea- sury Secretary Donald Regan, Bush Campaign Chairman Fred Malek, George Bush Jr., former CIA Director Robert Gates, the current SEC Chairman Art hur Levitt, Clinton transition team co-director Vernon Jordan, and politician Bob Strauss. These are former Cabinet-level politicians who have noth- 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ing to sell but their access in Government, i.e. their personal telephone books. All are directly or indirectly Trilateral connected. Frank Carlucci openly lists hi mself in the Trilateral biog- raphies as \"Vice Chairman, the Carlyle Group, former US Secretary of State.\" Vernon Jordan is listed as Partner Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.\" As New Republic author Mi chael Lewis describes the scene: The Carlyle Group in short ha s become a kind of salon des refusees for the influence peddling class. It offers a neat solution for people who d on't have a whole lot to sell besides their access, but who don't want to appear to be selling their access. So the \"access capitalist\" joins the perennial \"Washington lobbyist\" â€” roads to instant wealth for the not-so-fussy lawyer. One of the first successful Carlyle operations is known as \"The Great Eskimo Tax Scam of 1987.\" This well- organized and well-thought out loophole enabled Alaskan companies to sell their losses for hard cash to other com- panies. These losses were used to reduce the tax load of the companies and so everyone gained â€” except the U.S. tax- payer. Carlyle, of course, wa s in the business of matching Alaskan losses to corporate tax avoidance. Eskimos were flown to Washington, D.C. and shown how to organize some dubious losses â€” for which the high-toned Carlyle Group took a fancy fee of one percent. According to New Republic, Carl yle has excellent expertise to enable firms to buy Government property cheap â€” as Car- lucci had spent billions of tax dollars in contracts to large military industrial firms, these same firms were no doubt will- ing to look kindly on his efforts to organize a private auction of assets. According to Carlucci, \"everyone in our business is trying to figure out ways to avoid getting into an auction. Get into auctions, that's a way to lose a lot of money.\" The idea was \"private auctions\" for a few invited buyers. We call it a 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"conspiracy to defraud taxpayers â€” but Department of Jus- tice hasn't yet lifted a finger to go into court. Trilateral Frank Carlucci, whose efforts are described by Jack Anderson as \"the bureau cratic havoc wrought by Frank Carlucci, a human windstorm out of Washington\" is a perfect example of the market value of political contact. . . Carlucci has worked in every administra tion from Kennedy to Bush, in numerous departments without any momentous contribution to public welfare. According to Carlyle Chairman Rubenstein, \"I get resumes from some of the biggest na mes in town, lawyers who are making $800,000 a year. They call and say they'll come and work for free. It's almost embarrassing.\" Now why would any Washington lawyer want to work for free, in New York too? Obviously because Carlyle ha s a reputation for making money, lots of money, at public expense and is apparently untouchable. Yet one senses a certain uncertainty because the last words to the New Republic writer were \"How do I keep it from being a cover story?\" Global Money Monopoly Trilaterals want monopoly, world monopoly. Therefore, you must hold a key fundamental pr oposition in mind: Trilaterals are not interested in what monetary system works best, or most equitably, or whether gold is a more effective monetary device than paper, or what monetary system will support a higher standard of living for the world's poor. The overriding drive for Trilaterals is to manage the world economy, \"manage\" being a euphemism for control. This con- trol is exercised through so-c alled coordination of macro- economic policy, in spite of the dismal results from attempted macroeconomic direction. It is argued that the prime deside- ratum for this control device is to keep world peace. Nowhere is there any recognition of the hist orical fact that such control has always led to conflict: that denying national and ethnic independence is a sure road to strife and bloodshed. Trilaterals by their own words are interested in political power: all objectives are subor dinate to the political power 38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"needed to order the world as the Trilateralists see fit. So you will not find rational considerat ion of alternatives, or the weighing of options in Trilateral dogma. You can, however, expect an irrational drive, come what may, to control the world in the name of globalism and New World Order. Triangle Paper 14, \"Towards a Renovated International System,\" concludes that the 1944 Bretton Woods system has already \"come under increasing strain,\" and events have forced traumatic changes, that is, the periodic assault on the dollar and floating exchange rates. The current Trilateral objective is to build an international system, a world order based on cooperation and focusing on two aspects which require such cooperation: â€¢ International lending, and â€¢ The creation of international reserves. The Trilateral proposal is to involve five to ten leading core countries in establishing the new system. The rest of the world will have to go along as best it can. Some ideas to this end have already been implemen ted: for example, a new man- made artificial international money, the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) has been created for central banks. As the SDR is introduced, gold will (supposedly) be phased out of the international reserve system. International Bankers and Bancor (Paper Money) The benefits of Bancor will accr ue to international bankers more than to anyone else. The interlock between New York international bankers, the Trilateral Commission, and thus, Trilateral proposals in Bancor can be traced precisely. The earnings that major banks receive from overseas is a matter of public record and is a measure of the division between their domestic interests in the United States and a global economy. The degree of domestic control over the economy by international banks has been identified in a report published by the late Senator Lee Metcalf, \"Voting Rights in Major Corporations.'' Also a matter of public record are the names of internationa l bankers who are Trilateral 39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Commissioners. When we integrat e these three statistics, (a) source of bank earnings, (b) cont rol of domestic companies, and (c) Trilateral membership, we identify a highly significant interlock between international banks and the Trilateral push for a global economy. Table 4-1 ranks 12 international banks in order of their 1976 earnings from overseas; that is, the bank with the highest per- centage of its earnings from overseas is ranked Number 1, and the bank with the least pe rcentage from overseas is ranked Number 12 (columns 1 and 2). This percentage is com- pared with the equivalent 1970 figures to demonstrate that foreign earnings have ballooned since 1970 (columns 3 and 4). Column 5 is the Metcalf Index of domestic control by these same bankers, defined as th e number of the 122 companies examined by a congressional committee in which the bank is among the top five shareholders . Column 6 lists Trilateral commissioners who are also directors of these banks. Chase Manhattan is the bank with the highest percentage of earnings from abroad: a rema rkable 78 percent, compared to 22 percent in 1970. In brief, David Rockefeller's inter- national merchandising has made Chase a global bank, not an American bank, and we might call David a de facto world citizen, not an American citizen. At the same time, Chase has a very low rating on the Met calf Index. The bank is among the largest five stockholders in only eight of the 122 com- panies studied by the subcommittee (compared to Citibank's 25 and J.P. Morgan's 56). No fewer than six Chase Manha ttan directors (Kissinger is on the Chase International Adviso ry Board) were represented in 1976 on the Trilateral Commission.

Attempts to hold the price of gold at an artificially low \"official price\" proved elusive and ultimately de monstrated that even Tri- lateral power is subject to worl d market forces â€” and market forces are the sum of indi vidual marketing decisions. The task ahead for the Trilateral Commission world mana- gers is to integrate these m onopoly ideas into the world mone- tary system and make them work. The immediate and most compelling task is to operate the floating rate system to dam- pen erratic movements in exch ange rates, which are, of course, damaging to international trade. Such erratic move- ments do not occur in fixed rates tied to gold. However, gold moves the world away from th e \"cooperative\" international arrangements needed by Trilaterals, and gold, therefore, is a bigger problem than floating rate disorder. Following this is the task of world reserve mana gement. The Trilaterals want \"wider cooperation since the key to world reserve manage- ment is restraint in the additi ons to central bank holdings of gold and of course currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, the German Mark, the British Pound and the French Franc.\" 1 The sinking dollar is also a pr oblem, and an unforeseen one, particularly as it inevitably lead s to lesser use of dollars as a world reserve unit. Trilaterals with their vague views on gold were not able to foresee that the 1971 suspension of gold con- vertibility would be a millstone around the neck of dollar and \"international cooperation.\" The out-of-date views on gold held by the U.S. Treasury, under Trilateral control, are we ll exemplified by a letter from Gene E. Godley, assistant secret ary for legislative affairs at the treasury to Congressman J. Kenneth Robinson â€” a letter which incidentally illustrates clearly why the treasury has been able to lose billions of dollars for the U.S. taxpayer. There is, moreover, a high degree of uncertainty about the usefulness of gold as money. Its monetary role has greatly diminished in recent years,and its market price has varied widely. Thus, our go ld stocks no longer repre- sent an assured source of financing for our imports. 43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The principal objective in 1944, when Keynes proposed a universal money, was much narrower than current proposals: the system was to be one of multilateral clearing, a universal currency valid for trade trans actions throughout the world. According to Keynes: It is not necessary in order to attain these ends that we should dispossess gold from its traditional use. It is enough to supplement and regulate the total supply of gold and of the new money taken together. The new mon- ey must not be freely convertible into gold, for that would require that gold reserves should be held against it, and we should be back where we were, but there is no reason why the new money should not be purchasable for gold.\" When it came to christening this new money, Keynes said, \"What shall we call the new money? Bancor? Unitas? Both of them in my opinion are bad names, but we racked our brains without success to find a better.\" Even \"Bezant\" was pro- posed, interestingly the name of the last international coin (a gold coin) that circulated throughout the then known world for 800 years because it was a gold coin and never debased. Actually the two proposals, Bancor (British) and Unitas (United States), had different features. The adopted American plan, Unitas, deposited part of the U.S. gold reserves with the IMF together with a specific amount of domestic currency but created no international currency. By contrast, the Keynesian plan, Bancor, provided an interna- tional currency with overdraft facilities at the clearing union. In other words, today the Trilaterals have taken us back to the Keynesian Bancor plan rejected in 1944. A comparison of the two monetary schemes clarifies their major differences: Keynes Bancor Scheme (not adopted in 1944) Universal money - Bancor Gold accepted as a reserve No gold convertibility Trilateral-modified Bancor Scheme of 1978 (used today) Universal money â€” SDRs (Special Drawing Rights) Gold not accepted as reserve No gold convertibility 44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"National currencies not held as reserves Public approval necessary National currencies not held as reserves Public approval not necessary Bancor was not adopted in 1944. It's now a matter of his- tory that the related Harry Dexter White Unitas plan which was adopted led the U.S. into bankruptcy: the dollar weak- nesses of today are directly traceable to the Bretton Woods Unitas plan. Today's Trilaterals are political animals, with New World Order objectives, not interested in orderly world trade but in a specific future world struct ure under their control. The question is not to design a workable system to facilitate trade and improve human welfare, but to design a system that will enhance and preserve power for the Trilaterals. The Trilateral answer is to reinvent the system not used in 1944, the Keynesian Bancor, but modified this time as a universal cur- rency divorced completely from gold and national currencies. The extent of insider willingness to disregard, and even distort, widely held progold vi ews of others is exemplified by an extraordinary statement in Robert Solomon's book, which is aptly subtitled An Insider's View. This is Solomon's interpretation of the motivati on of gold-oriented economists: Those who are worshipful of gold (gold bugs or, more politely, chrysophilites) are usually motivated by one or more of these concerns: par ticular economic theories now held by a small minority of economists, distrust of government, (and) international political objectives. The rationale for paper money, to quote Robert Solomon again: Just as there is a need in each country for economic policies aimed at high employment and price stability, there is a need, at the international level, for a similar effort to make the policies of individual countries com- patible with the well-being of the world economy. Since there exists no international authority that can directly 45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"perform this function, it can be done only by means of consultation and cooperation among representatives of independent nations meeting together in established international form. This European episode and th e later creation of the Euro- pean Currency Unit (ECU) exemplifies the Trilateral weakness in historical precedent. Why did the Germans refuse to go along with Keynesian demand stimulation? Because two factors are locked into the German psyche and ignored by American planners. Fi rst, the unparalleled rise of the German economy from the ashes of 1946 was due to plain old laissez faire free enterpri se, not artifici al Keynesian locomotives. Second, Germany has had two recent devastat- ing price inflations (1923 and 1946), and both times the Mark went to zero. Germans know the consequences of inflation and Keynesian-type stimulation. In sum, a combination of factors â€” German refusal to adopt Keynesian stimulation, the French political scene, and the collapse in the leading indi cators (signaling a depression in 1979) â€” has reduced inte rnational cooperation and coordination. One can perceive in the background a central reason why the Trilaterals, essentially th e big New York banking powers, must move ahead with Bancor. . . why they must develop the so-called Witteveen facility. . . why they must create elastic international reserves, to be expanded at the push of a computer key. The central unstated propellant for global fiat money is that the international moneta ry system is on a precarious merry-go-round: borrow â€” generate a deficit â€” be unable to repay â€” reschedule â€” borrow some more. The world debt bal- loon must be kept inflated If the balloon goes bust, so do the New York banks (remember Chase receives 78 percent of its earnings from abroad). If one of the world players decides he's had enough, if a New York bank says no to Zaire, if Turkey or anyone of a dozen other LDCs default, the whole pack of monetary cards will come tumbling down. 46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Monopolists Plot Their Course The 1993 Annual Meeting of the Trilateral Commision held very appropriately in Wash ington, D.C. on March 27-29 focused on the new Clinton Administration. Trilateral Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke to the group and read a letter from fellow Trilateral, President Bill Clinton. However, the most enlightening feature came from the Chairman's Report (page 75 in the Report) entitled \"An Agenda for Trilateral Leadership.\" The title itself negates the propaganda that the Trilateral Commission is a \"study group.\" This title claims \"leader ship\" and an \"agenda,\" i.e. a plan. And indeed the speech, presumably expected to be kept semi-secret, did spell out an agenda for a New World Order and the need for definite action and planning to bring this about: A future order based on sustained cooperation will not happen without the conscious planning and steering of political leadership and without a fuller sense among our citizens of the needs of this new era. ... Trilaterals are right in believing that citizens are unenthusi- astic about \"the needs of the new era.\" The \"needs\" are largely chosen and exploited by the Tri- laterals themselves for self interested reasons. Furthermore Trilaterals have no legal validit y. They are not elected. They are not subject to any citizen review. They apparently can do what they want without cons ulting any citizen. No wonder citizens are uninterested.

We pointed out that such magnified problems appear to be selected according to the following criteria: â€¢ The problem must be important from a global viewpoint; â€¢ The problem must be one that can be solved by some degree of Trilateral-Communist cooperation following a presumed unstated objective to merge the U.S. with a socialist structure. â€¢ The venture must be one that can be pursued without undue intrusion into the internal affairs of the participating states. An important problem area that fits the criteria for selective manipulation is that of world food. Food supplies are inadequate, people need food to live, and the technological and financial abilities for food pr oduction are heavily within Trilateral countries. As Triangle Paper No. 13 puts it: Prospects are somewhat more substantial for coopera- tion in the realm of increasing food production. Produc- tion increases require both more effective domestic 49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"agricultural policies on the part of de veloping countries and enlarged provision of outside capital and technology to them for agricultural development. In particular, Triangle Paper 13 claims: The prospects for cooperation are more promising with regard to the third objectiv e: the development of ade- quate food (particularly grain) reserves. A reserve stock policy that could keep cereal price changes within a less disruptive range than in the recent past could make a considerable contribution not only to restraining infla- tion in the developed and developing worlds, but also to ensuring that adequate food supplies are available to developing nations at prices that will not impose an undue drain on foreign exchange... In considering Trilateral ta rgets for international food reserves and world agriculture, we need to consider what the Trilaterals say they want and compare it to what they really want. Fascinated by the idea of \"food power\" and \"contrived shortages,\" the Trilaterals inte nd to use food as a weapon to bring about the New World Order. One stated objective is to create an \"international system of national food reserves\" by massive manipulation of recen tly acquired political power against private markets and ini tiatives. It is proposed, for example: â€¢ To keep grain prices in a \"less disruptive range,\" â€¢ Restrain inflation, â€¢ Ensure adequate food reserves for lesser developed countries (LDCs) and â€¢ Overcome periodic food imbalances. Trilateral intentions for a wo rld grain storage program are published by the Trilateral Commission and the Brookings Institution, headed by Trila teral Commissi oner Bruce K. MacLaury. Other Trilateralis ts on the Brookings Board of Trustees include Robert V. Roos a (partner in Brown Brothers, Harriman), Lucy Wilson Benson, and Gerard C. Smith (ambassador at large for non-pr oliferation matters.) In 1976 50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Philip H. Trezise, with the assistance of former Assist ant Secretary of Agriculture Carroll Brunthaver, published Re Building Grain Reserves: Toward An International System. Brunthaver had previously been involved in a conflict of sworn testimony, investigated by the Senate Permanent S ubcommittee on Investigations. (See Report, Russian Grain Transactions, 93rd Congress, 2nd Session, p. 33). In the Trezise book, the problems for multi- lateral agreement on grain reserves are considered to be \"formidable.\" Going ahead is \"compelling\" because of the following: upward moves in grain prices have a \"pervasive influence\" on all food prices; they mean more worldwide hunger; and grain stocks can be used in periods of famine. More specifically, Trezise proposed: â€¢ An initial reserve of sixty million tons of grain, rising to between seventy-five and eighty million tons by 1981, â€¢ Contributions from all industrial countries, including Argentina and South Africa, â€¢ A program cost of $6 billion plus $640 million in annual storage costs, â€¢ That stocks should be \"national,\" bought at 10 percent above floor prices and sold at 10 percent below ceiling prices, â€¢ That twenty million tons be set aside for famine reserve. As in most Trilateral writings, Trezise includes only evi- dence in favor of proposed Trilateral policy. Trilaterals typi- cally use an ideological procedure of gathering facts and opin- ion supporting their argument, never allowing a hint of seri- ous counterargument. Two glar ing unstated consequences in Trezise's book are: 1. Any such massive stockpiling will raise the long-term price of grain, negating the objective of \"restraining inflation\"; 2. The only way to stop the resulting inflation is through rigid government price controls and regimented farming. The choice of food products as a means of reducing national sovereignty is emphasized in the following paragraph: 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"There are several reasons why commodities are treated differently than other products that enter into trade. Probably the most basic reason is that commodity sup- plies are linked to land, tying them to the concept of territory, over which nation-st ates exercise sovereignty. As a general proposition, the demand for, and the supply of, most commodities are rather unresponsive to changes in price over short periods of time, so that quite sharp fluctuations in price can be generated by fairly modest changes in overall market conditions. Moreover, the time required to expand supplies is often lengthy, although this property varies widely among individual commodi- ties. Although the value of all commodity consumption represents no more than about ten percent of annual eco- nomic activity in industrialized nations, and even though substitutes exist for any particular commodity, commodities are sometimes distinguished as \"core products.\" The Trilateral elite, through control of the U.S. executive branch, will be calling the shots on a world basis to reduce producer control and indirectly national sovereignty. The amount of political power possessed by world grain producers can be measured by comparing the area devoted to 1976 wheat production in Trilateral regions: Thousand Hectares European Economic Community 11,232 Japan 89 United States 28,700 U.S.S.R. (for comparison) 59,462 This U.S./Trilateral dominance is further reflected in world export figures of wheat plus flour for 1975-76: Metric Tons United States 31,522,000 Canada 12,136,000 Australia 8,072,000 EEC 7,729,000 Argentina 3,111,000 Japan 38,000 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"If it were possible for other countries to substantially in- crease their wheat production, the quickest way to do so would be to raise government price support levels. However, except for Argentina, the U.S. already has the lowest support levels among the 30 or so wh eat-producing countries in the world. Thus, one can see how the U.S. has acreage, yield, and production efficiency all workin g for it at the bargaining table. This discussion of \"food power\" is not academic â€” it has major significance for any grain trader, farmer, firm, or individual in any way conn ected with grain products. The Trilaterals propose interna tional sanctions against any government, private firm, or produ cer (in or out of an associ- ation) that interferes with Trilateral objectives. These sanc- tions will not be applied in any principled way, but will be used pragmatically to achieve Trilateral goals. The key to this plan and associated sanctions is in Triangle Paper 10, \"Seek- ing a New Accommodation in World Commodity Markets.\" Therein, the concept of \"contrived shortages\" is floated. A contrived shortage is any non- Trilateralist action in the market place that interferes with Trilateral objectives. For example, a farmer withholding grain from the market and waiting for a higher price, is gui lty of contrived shortage. The paper further states that thes e contrived shortages can be informal, rather than brought about by a formal association of producers. While all offenders are to be subject to effective interna- tional investigation and action, the penalties are not to be applied equally. A non-Trilateral developed country such as Argentina or South Africa will be dealt harsher penalties (i.e. sanctions) than underdeveloped Zaire or Zambia (phrased subtly as \". . . in the case of non-industrialized countries, however, it is necessary to cons ider this issue from a broader political perspective\"). Consequently, any informal or formal farmers group in the U.S. protesting price levels â€” a nd such protest will be inevi- table when Trilateral objectives surface â€” will be subject to penalties. When can these i ndividual firms and nonfavored 53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"governments anticipate Trilate ral hostility? Probably under the following conditions: â€¢ If they attempt to stabilize or move market prices to non- Trilateral levels, â€¢ If they respond to market impe rfections or undertake any systematic withholding of supplies from the market, â€¢ If they make any informat ion exchange for these purposes. Trilaterals are well aware that market fluctuations in agri- culture are highly sensitive to supply changes, and that whoever controls the supply controls the market. In Triangle Paper 14, \"Towar d a Renovated International System,\" two additional and interesting caveats relating to international grain reserves appear: 1. That the Soviet Union can benefit from fixed prices and guaranteed sources of supply, and 2. That if the U.S.S.R. doesn't see the wisdom of joining the Trilateral plan, the Trilaterals will go it alone. On the other hand, the paper comments: We have not sought ventures that would exacerbate Sino-Soviet rivalry. We have thus focussed, for the most part, on projects that would involve either the USSR or China, but not both. This does not mean that cooperation with the Soviet Union and China cannot be pursued simultaneously â€” only that it should not focus on the same projects. The chances of Soviet or Chinese agreement are, of course, uncertain; our assessments are tentative, based on such limited evidence as exists. Only by seeking cooperation can its feasibility be ascertained Looking at the period since 1976 when these ideas were floated, agriculture has been used to promote New World Order, in some ways not too obvious. The Soviet Union dictatorship was kept alive for decades by American wheat sold at below market ratesâ€”and butter and cheese subsidized by the American taxpayer. Further- more Trilateral writer Philip Trezise was one of the most vocal Washington policy makers, promoting the downright false 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"view that the Soviet Union wa s technically viable â€” all the while American grain companies and multinationals were preparing to exploit the Russian market. When it came to Somalia however, a minor pawn on the New World Order scene, some two million Somalis were allowed to starve before U.S. came to offer help â€” then the help was a comic opera military excursion (network TV cameras were on Somali beaches filming U.S. Marines wading ashore â€” presumably the network crews got there first with dry feet). The Somali fiasco de monstrated that Trilateral objectives are political, not humanitarian. The humanitarian is merely an excuse for the military. And while Trilaterals say they will not \"exacerbate Sino- Soviet rivalry\" they most cer tainly condone Chinese persecu- tion of dissidents. Every time the Chinese demonstrate bru- tality towards their own peopl e and the Western world calls for sanctions, the Trilateral for ces urge restraint and caution. For what reason? Obviously, to protect investments in China. Crisis Politics in Agriculture As Trilateral policies are im plemented, unrest among farmers surfaces â€” mostly in Europe, especially among French and Belgian farmers but also from time to time in the United States. A nationwide farm strike was well underway in mid-1978, with participating farmers from all areas of agriculture. Demonstrations like \"tractorcades\" were common events covered on national T.V. While some farmers in winter areas were not sure if they would be planting spring crops, others were already pressed to the wall with bankruptcy: they had no choice but to refrain from planting as long as prices remained relatively low. Once again the banks were in danger of becoming owners of real es tate â€” farms. Since banks do not want that responsibility, every effort was made to support shaky farms and ranches. Recently, the Federal Land Bank (where most farmers have found an easy and inexpen- sive source of credit for decades) announced it would not foreclose on farmers in default. The implications of this are 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"far-reaching, especially since no one knows just how many farmers are in serious trouble. Big changes cannot be implemented only during periods of crisis. It appears the Trilateralists are pushing for a major farming crisis in the U.S. within the next year or so, one that can be manipulated for Trilateral ends. If the farming indus- try becomes bankrupt, the government's only choice will be to \"institutionalize\" the nation's food production in the same manner that Amtrak was \"nationalized.\" On the other hand, if the government chooses to let prices rise to the point where farmers can realize a profit, it will be only with additional and far-reaching controls over the farmer. Government-induced prosperity has always resulted in a trade-off: Profits for Controls. The current situation in the U.S. plays directly into Tri- lateral hands. The grain or \"cereal snake\" will be a foregone conclusion when the Trilaterals find themselves caught in the vise between farmers crying for higher prices and consumers demanding lower food prices. But, of course, it will have been a \"contrived\" crisis in the first place. How then will a national grain reserve â€” keyed to the inter- national grain plan of the Trilateral Commission â€” affect the American farmer? The carrot offered by the Carter administration, under Tri- lateral control, was stable and \"high\" prices. Farmers, suffer- ing from four years of low prices, were eager listeners. Secre- tary of Agriculture Bergland (a Trilateral nominee) vowed \"to even out the booms and busts\" in agriculture. (To this, former Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz responded, \". . . you'll notice he's going to even out the boom first.\") In practice, the Carter grain storage program produced the following: â€¢ A narrow grain price snake. The government supported the floor of the snake, while whipped-up consumer pres- sure, through a captive media, created a lid on the ceil- ing of the snake, making an ultimate government price ceiling inevitable. â€¢ More â€” and more â€” government control. If the government determines quantities produced and 56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"market prices, then ultimatel y, it will decree who plants what, and where. Farmers have yet to learn they cannot have tradi- tional freedoms and security at the same time. The summer of 1977 was favorable for grain farmers, due to increased yields and stocks; and then, worried over produc- tion and low prices, farmers asked for acreage cutbacks. By August 1977, Secretary of Treasury Blumenthal and Secre- tary of State Vance wanted no cutbacks: they argued in- creased production was needed for the storage program. It is not clear if this was a dispute between Trilateralists and non- Trilateralists in the cabinet, but it is not likely. Former Minnesota Congressman Bergland is not a Trilateral member, but he was sponsored by Vice President Walter Mondale â€” and Bergland has a longtime image to maintain of being \"the farmer's friend.\" President Carter made a contradictory decision by calling for Congress to legislate a 20 percent acreage cutback plus adding 30 to 35 millio n tons of grain for the national stockpile. By 1994 the grassroots reaction by farmers could be iden- tified but had not reache d crisis proportions. Finally American trade unions at the local level sensed they were being betrayed at the national level. In the days of Samuel Gompers and George Meany, American workers were represented with honesty in th eir struggle with management. The coming of Trilateralism changed that and it took many years for the unions to recognize they had been sold out. Lane Kirkland, boss of the AFL-CIO, was a long time Trilateral member (not in 1993). His pla ce was taken on the Commission by Glen E. Watts, former Pres ident of the Communications Workers of America, and Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers. A remarkable article, \"DDT in the Baby Food â€” and other threats posed by GATT\" appeared in the San Francisco Examiner (February 2, 1994) by Jay Hopkins, a writer on labor affairs. Remarkable, because the article not only reflected labor's sense of betray al, but that it appeared in a major city newspaper. Here's a couple of quotes from Hopkins: \"U.S. workers are 57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"being told by their own govern ing elite that they must compete in the world market against the poor masses in the Third World.\" The article points out that recent GATT sessions received delegations from \"major cor porations like DuPont, Mon- santo, and Cargill, alongside U.S. government officials. There were virtually no representa tives from small businesses, farms, churches, unions, environmental groups. Obviously the economic interests of multinational corporations including those based in the United States are frequently at odds with the welfare of average Americans.\" Hopkins stated bluntly, \"should the US Government defend American sovereignty, jobs and economic indepen- dence?\" or \"throw American workers and consumers into a downward spiraling global comp etition with nations that have nowhere near our quality of life?\" What is happening in many indus tries and certainly in agri- culture and food processing, is th at the American standard of living is being pulled down de liberately by the Trilateral process. Whether enough American workers, who are notoriously sparse readers, will read thes e words and spread the message is unlikely. In all probability, we shall see the old time high standard of living of the American worker go by the wayside. The unions should be watching out for their members, but union leaders are too interested in the trappings of power. Why American Federation of Teachers, Communications Workers of America, and International Ladies Garment Workers Union would want to be represented on the Trilateral Commission can only be explained in terms of the limited vision and self-advancing greed of union leaders. We cannot imagine that Samuel Gompers or George Meany would give the Trilateral Comm ission even the time of day.

The American consumer will not find lower prices but will see lower quality products in many cases (for example, in imported meat) and a loss of jobs in labor-intensive agricultural and food processing operations. Canning and meat processing plants are closing by the score in the United States and their operations moved overseas to lower wage costs. The original objective of world \"cooperation\" in agriculture stated in Triangle Paper No. 13 had been heavily imple- mented by 1994. However, the impact on American jobs can only be generally estimated because so much low-paying labor in the U.S. has come from illegal immigrants. Within another 20 years we project that all global agricul- ture and food processing will be under control of the interna- tional giants. This will give Tr ilaterals the power to create abundance or famine at will. 59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX: TRILATERALS DON'T LIKE TAXATION.. FOR THEMSELVES Oddly, while there are Trilateralist papers on almost every major policy issue, there are none at all on taxation. After some research, we discovered a possible reason for the silence. Taxation is not a pressing problem for Trilateralists; it is only a pressing problem for you and me. Research unearthed an interesting paradox: Trilater als emphatically favor more taxes for the common man, but do very well avoiding taxation for themselves and their corporate vehicles. When we were able to identify Trilateral public statements on Proposition 13, for example, they were not unexpectedly strongly against reducing Calif ornia property taxes. For example, â€¢ Bank of America (Trilatera ls Clawson and Wood were directors) contributed $25,000 to defeat Jarvis-Gann (Proposition 13). â€¢ Governor Thompson of Illinois, who is making appropri- ate presidential noises, rejected a similar tax reduction program in Illinois. â€¢ Carter said Proposition 13 is an \"aberration\" that will not sweep the country. â€¢ The Los Angeles Times (a director is Commissioner Harold Brown) was described by Jarvis himself as \"the vindictive paranoiac, schizophr enic Los Angeles Times\" for the vitriolic nature of its opposition to 13. 61"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"In sum, Trilateral put their weight against Jarvis-Gann and tax reduction. Trilateral opposition to tax reduction most emphatically did not apply to their own taxes nor to those of their corporate affiliations. Trilateral multin ationals have successfully avoided paying taxes in the Un ited States and have made some headway in tax avoida nce in England and possibly elsewhere. The United States picture wa s publicized by Congressman Charles A. Vanik (on 26 January 1978) after a congressional study of the taxes paid by major multinational corporations. Reported Congressman Vanik: This study, covering tax year 1976, examines 168 com- panies. These include 108 industrial, 7 mining, 8 airline, 9 railroad, 5 trucking, 13 utility, 8 retailing, and 10 commercial bank companies. Because a few did not furnish data adequate for computation, some categories of taxes or rates could not be computed Where sufficient data made computations possible, the average effective U.S. tax rate on worldwide income of the corporations was approximately 13.04 percent, down significantly from the 21.3 per cent rate in tax year 1975. In order to qualify for a tax rate this low, an average family of four could only have earned $20,000. The companies listed in this study had a pretax income of more than $38.7 billion. The figures show that 17 companies paid nothing in effective Federal income taxe s in tax year 1976 â€” 6 more than tax year 1975 â€” despite combined total worldwide net incomes of more than $2,594,060,000 â€” table 1. The 17 companies accumulated tax credits of more than $375 million. In some cases, however, companies paid no taxes because they sustained net losses. In other cases, some companies will claim to have \"paid''Federal taxes, but their credits exceed taxes, resulting in no effective payment and an effective tax rate of zero.â€” Included in this tax avoida nce group of multinationals we 62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"find numerous corporations w ith Trilateral connections. Having assumed the burden of deciding the future for American society and the New World Order, one would at least expect that Trilaterals pay their full share of the costs. We therefore examined the Va nik study from the viewpoint of identifying the taxes paid by multinationals represented in the Trilateral Commissi on by company directors. The lowest income tax bracket for an individual U.S. tax- payer is 14 percent. On the other hand, Chase Manhattan, Continental Illinois, and First Chicago, the power houses behind Trilateralism, all pay far lower rates. In fact, Chase Manhattan Bank paid no U.S. taxes at all in 1976. On the one hand, David Rockef eller (chairman of Chase and the largest individual shareholde r in Chase,) wants to decide the future of American society and the world; on the other hand, his bank is totally unwilling to make a contribution to the new American society and a New World Order. Given these facts, we have ever y right to be skeptical about announced Trilateral intentions and objectives. We have every right to assume that th e Trilateral Commission may be a gigantic rip-off on American society. Unfortunately no study of multin ational taxation rates has been made by Congress since 1978, the Vanik study was the last comprehensive study which revealed the low rates paid by multinationals. However, we believe that the rates paid in the late 1970s and included here have not changed dramati- cally in the last decade. As we all know, personal income tax rates are much higher than the rates paid by the tax-avoiding multinationals. In the U.S. the starting individual tax rate is 14 percent and the highest rate is 70 pe rcent. In Canada, the rate starts at 17 percent and ranges to 43 percen t. Other European countries have even higher rates up to a confiscatory 98 percent in Britain. If you are a Trilatera lly-connected international bank, your effective rate in 1976 was much lower than the lowest individual bracket.

Take, for example, a report in the London Economist (14 January 1978) from the British view- point, under the scathing headline: \"No Tax Please, We're Banks\" American and other foreign banks in London could end up paying little or no British ta x if their huge claims for relief which are now being examined by the Inland Revenue are accepted Even the British clearing banks could have their tax bills dramatically reduced ... the MNC is also a source of concern to some govern- ments, since from its wide base it is often able to circum- vent national monetary, fis cal, and exchange policies. The possibility of distortions arising from intracorporate pricing practices to take a dvantage of national varia- tions in tax laws has also been cited with concern. A check of multinational cor porations and their 1976 U.S. tax rates on world income turns up some multinationals that did pay significantly high U.S. tax rates.

A recent report by the House Government Operations Committee disclosed the following: â€¢ IRS decisions on some multinational oil firms have cost the U.S. Treasury over $7 billion since 1974. \"By the early 1970s, multinational petroleum companies were operat- ing abroad under a set of factual and legal circumstances completely at variance with those upon which the previ- ous foreign tax credit rulings were based.\" â€¢ IRS failed to audit oil company returns or require them to provide supporting information for their expense claims (Presumably audits are only for individual taxpayers.) â€¢ These favorable actions stemmed from \"interference\" by then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (Trilateral). 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"â€¢ More recent \"improper interference\" for the same purpose came from Secretary of Treasur y Blumenthal (Trilateral).

In brief, a House committee has charged Trilateralists Henry Kissinger and Michael Blumenthal with \"improper interference\" with IRS to obtain benefits for certain companies.

Another example follows for those readers who have read my Wall Street and the Bols hevik Revolution and who may remember that in 1918, the lead ing Wall Street law firm sup- porting the infant Bolshevik re gime in Russia was Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett of New Yor k. As one indication of then- support, partner Thomas D. Thacher wrote a report which became decisive in gaining British cabinet support for the Bolsheviks. Also Thomas Lamont , Dwight Morrow, and H. P. Davison were closely involved in developing policy towards the Bolsheviks: all were partners in the J. P. Morgan firm. While in London on 13 April 1918, Thomas D. Thacher, a member of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia, wrote to the American ambassador in London that he had received a request from H. P. Davison, a Morgan partner, \"to confer with Lord Northcliffe\" concerning the situation in Russia and then to go on to Paris \"for ot her conferences.\" Lord North- cliffe was ill, and Thacher left a memorandum to be submitted to Northcliffe on his return to London with yet another Morgan partner, Dwight W.

This memorandum not 66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"only made explicit suggestions about Russian policy that supported the pro-Bolshevik position of William Boyce Thompson (director of Chase, now Chase Manhattan, Bank), but even stated that \"the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet government in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary   army.\"   The first three proposals in Thacher's report follow: First of all... the Allies should discourage Japanese intervention in Siberia. In the second place, the fullest assistance should be given to the Soviet Government in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary army. Thirdly, the Allied Governments should give their moral support to the Russian people in their efforts to work out their own political system free from the domi- nation of any foreign power. . . Was Wall Street attorney Thacher a capitalist enemy of the Bolsheviks? Of course not. Thach er was right in there, help- ing the revolution, as part of the \"breakaway ruling class,\" along with capitalists from J. P. Morgan and Chase Bank. Similar aid for Marxist revolut ion came in South Africa and Red China. And who was U.S. Secretary of State in charge of facilitating this aid? Cyrus D. Vance, who before his appoint- ment as Secretary of State wa s also a partner in Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett. Senator Clifford P. Case was a member of the firm of Simp- son, Thacher and Bartlett fr om 1928 to 1953, when he became president of the Fund for the Republic, the founda- tion that funded the study for a \"new constitution\" so desired by the elite. Yet another memorandum from William Boyce Thompson (director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chase Bank) to Lloyd George (prime minister of Great Britain) in December 1917, supported the Bolsheviks and admitted in part: About the overthrow of the last Kerensky government we materially aided the di ssemination of the Bolshevik 67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"literature, distributing it through agents and by aero- planes to the German army. If the suggestion is permis- sible, it might be well to consider whether it would not be desirable to have this same Bolshevik literature sent into Germany and Austria across th e West and Italian fronts. Does this sound as if Wall Street and the Bolsheviks were enemies? Or allies? Another excellent example of the capitalist-communist alli- ance is Gulf Oil in Angola, the financial backer of the Neto government, while Cuban troops protect Gulf's Cabinda pro- duction facilities. And how about Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum? In the Russian edition of Lenin's Collected Works, you will find several letters from Lenin to Hammer addressed affectionately as \"D ear Comrade.\" Capitalists, the big enemy of communists? N onsense. They work hand-in- glove to rule the world. And in 1994 inside history is not too much different to 1919. It has not gone unnoti ced that politicians make election promises that are abandoned when they enter office. President Bill Clint on, a Trilateralist, is a prime example. Election promises to reduce bur eaucracy, to protect indivi- dual privacy, to reduce the power of the elite and lobbyists and similar populist scenarios have all been abandoned. And a series of declassified FBI documents illustrates the behind-the-scenes origins of many Clinton appointments. They are evenly divided between associates and supporters of the Institute for Policy Studies, a pro-Marxist think tank, and multinational professional lobby ists. The co-directors of the transition team were both Tril aterals: Warren Christopher and Vernon Jordan; and both were big time lobbyists. Then came a series of appointments reflecting Marxist-leaning Washington think tank persons (mostly from the Institute for Policy Studies, i.e. Ant hony Lake, Leon Panetta, Morton Halperin) and/or big time lobbyists (Ron Brown, Warren Christopher), and revolving door insiders (Winston Lord, David Gergen, Bruce Babbitt). 68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The only truly non-Washington appointment is Attorney General Reno, who has proven herself adept at squashing investigations and actions that might embarrass the Administration â€” BCCI, Brow n bribe investigation, Whitewater affair, Waco. . . The key to understanding world events is to look at the world in terms of a Marxist Ruling-Class Alliance. Then, seemingly inconsistent actions and events make sense: â€¢ The elite subsidizes Marxist regimes: they are not enemies. â€¢ The elite abandons free ente rprise allies: it wants socialism. â€¢ The elite presses for more indi vidual taxation, that is, the Marxist \"graduated income tax.\" â€¢ The elite reduces its own taxation in the same way that the Moscow elite lived it up in Soviet Russia at the expense of the Russian working class. The textbook modern history is illusory because it is based on a mythical capitalist-vers us-communist struggle. Thus, when we are asked to believe that Trilateral ambitions are morally justified to build a New World Order devoted to the peace and welf are of mankind, two points strike us: (a) this end does not coincide with other interpreta- tions of Trilateral motivations and actions, and (b) the means adopted appear authoritarian a nd suggest that the ends may also be authoritarian.

To emphasize the discriminatory approach of the Carter administration on tax matters, we can do no better than quote the congressional testim ony of Philip E. Vision, supervisory revenue officer in the Chicago District Office of IRS, who in 1976 blew a small whistle on IRS procedures before the Subcommittee on Ov ersight of the Committee on Ways and Means. Congressman Jones asked Vision about differing treatment of rich and poor taxpayers: Is there pressure to sei ze a small business or a poor taxpayer's property in order to close the case, and pressure to perhaps settle quickly w ith a rich taxpayer who has plenty of accounting and legal ability to drag things out? To which IRS official Vision replied: In all candor, Congressman, I must say this: You will find those branches or groups that are involved in the inner city of Chicago, the lo w income, the closures are highest because there is really no problem. It requires no technical skills or knowledge to prepare a levy upon the employer of an employee who is getting take-home pay of about $80. We can go in, serve the levy, and take the entire $80. Certainly a taxpayer who is earning $80 could hardly be expected to employ an e xpensive attorney or CPA. Usually when he comes in, in response to the levy, it is with tears in his eyes because he allocated that $80 to the gas or electric company and because IRS took that money, his electric and gas will be shut off and also part of that money was intended to feed his family.

To fully understand the impli cations of a vi ciously gradu- ated income tax system aimed at the small/medium American businessman and the broad middle class and to understand as well the role of the multinationals and the international bankers who make up the power elite behind the Trilateral Commission, we need to go b ack to 1847 and the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Of the Communist revolution, Marx and Engels wrote: In the first instance, this can only be affected by despotic inroads upon the ri ghts of property and by despotic interference with bourgeois methods of produc- tion; that is to say by meas ures which seem economically inadequate and untenable, but have far-reaching effects, and are necessary as means for revolutionizing the whole system of production. In brief, elimination of pr operty owners and small- and medium-sized businessmen (\"Bourgeois methods of produc- tion\") outside the orbit of the multinationals and interna- tional banks is an essential prerequisite to socialism. Then Marx and Engels outline the famous ten \"measures\" for achieving revolution in the advanced countries to bring about socialism. These measures are described by Marx and Engels as follows: In the most advanced countries they willy generally speaking, take the following forms: 1. Expropriation of landed pr operty, and the use of landrents to defray State expenditure. 2. A vigorously graduated income tax. 3. Abolition of the right of inheritance. 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigres and rebels. 5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclu- sive monopoly. 71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"6. Centralization of the means of transport in the hands of the State. 7. Increase of national fact ories and means of produc- tion, cultivation of uncultiv ated land, and improvement of cultivated land in accordance with a general plan. 8. Universal and equal obligation to work; organization of industrial armies, espe cially for agriculture. 9. Agriculture and urban industry to work hand-in- hand, in such a way as, by degr ees, to obliterate the dis- tinction between town and country. 10. Public and free education of all children. Abolition of factory work for children in its present form. Education and material production to be combined Notably, there is a parallel between Marx and Trilateral propositions: centralization of cr edit in IMF and the Federal Reserve System parallels Marx's measure 5. AMTRAK, fed- eral funding of rapid transit, and persistent efforts to cut down on use of individual auto mobiles parallels Marx's measure 6. Finally, our Sixteenth Amendment to the Consti- tution, the \"income tax amendment,\" is none other than the \"vigorously graduated income tax\" proposed by Marx in the Manifesto. What has this to do with Trilateral multinational avoidance of taxation? Plenty, as it turns out. It is interesting to reread Karl Marx's Manifesto in the light of the alliance between Wall Street multinationals and the Communist imperialists. Marxists, especially, should reread Marx. The enemy of Marxist totalitarianism is not the capitalist but rather the \"Bour geoisie,\" the middle class. Marx sees the bourgeoisie as the source of all that is evil, yet he does not include all the ruling establishment in those designated for elimination. To the contrary, when the class war is about to be fought to a finish, Karl Ma rx envisaged a curious event: \"a small part of the ruling class breaks away to make common cause with the re volutionary class, the class which holds the future in its hands.\" In sum, Marx envisaged a coal ition of ruling interests of the 72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"revolutionary Marxists and a segment of the ruling class. This is precisely what history has recorded in the hundred or so years since the Manifesto was published. One of the most significant forces in modern wo rld development has been the assistance from a relatively small yet powerful part of the ruling Western establishment to the Soviet Union channeled through such influential orga nizations as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and today the Trilateral Commis- sion. In Marx's terms, are not Cyrus Eaton, Armand Hammer, David Rockefeller, and the Trilateral Commission ruling class breakaways? Have not Marxists and the \"break- away ruling class capitalists\" joined hands to eliminate the American middle class? Unfortuna tely, academic analysts are blind to the implications of the alliance: they read Marx with preconceptions. So let's present some evidence. In 1976, the Marxist government of Angola reorganized Diamang, its diamond-producing monopoly. The Neto Marx- ist government will own 60.8 per cent, and the balance will be owned by the former foreign corp orate owners. It will be a mixed company. But which former owners will be expropri- ated to make way for the new Marxist shareholders? Not the big greedy capitalists we hear so much about in socialist literature, but, in the words of the Neto government, \"a large number of small shareholders .\" The major \"foreign com- panies,\" the large multinationals, that is, the ruling capitalists, will not be affected by the takeover. In other words, the ruling class joins hands with Marxist revolution- aries against the small bourgeois owners. 73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE Trilaterals have a fondness for declaring \"war\" on world prob- lems.

In this chapter we consider (a) the \"war on AIDS\" and (b) the \"war on drugs.\" In each case we unearth a story very different from the establishment media official line intended for public consumption. THE WAR ON AIDS According to Dr. Robert Gallo and other establishment AIDS researchers, this deadly disease with the capability to wipe out the world originated with a little green monkey in Africa who bit a native with disastrous results. Believe it or not, establishment scientists eith er push this absurd, unproven argument or dismiss origins as irrelevant. There is another argument, backed by hard evidence and reflected in five books by respect ed medical doctors. Briefly, this argument is that AIDS is a man-made disease developed by the U.S. Army as part of a biological warfare program, 75"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"funded by Congress and released by elitist fanatics to elimin- ate specific segments of the world's population. Horrific as genocide by global fanatics may appear, there is more evidence for this interpre tation than for the little green monkey theory. Even more horrendous, this argument takes us right to Tri- lateralist Robert S. McNamara, former Secretary of State and Chairman of the World Bank. It was McNamara who ap- proved funding for development of an artificial AIDS virus later funded by Congress. Here's the story based on the research of these five doctors which we supplemented with our own research for documen- tary evidence.

Originally called U.S. Army Biological Labora- tories it is now labeled U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). The Army maintains a Special Operations Division (SOD) on the Fort Detrich base with a formal operating agreement with CIA (memor andum signed in May 1952). Both CIA and Army have covered their tracks well but some original documents survive to outline a horrific story. In the early '60s U.S. Army SOD personnel used speci- ally designed suitcases to spray unsuspecting American civilians with bacillus subtilis at the Greyhound Bus Terminals in Washington, Chicago and San Francisco. 1 Available from T HE P HOENIX L ETTER , Suite 216C, 1517 14th Street West, Billings, MT 59102; $87 for one year.

The number of one way tickets so ld at time of release was used to estimate distribution of the bacterial agents. (Bacillus subtilis can be bought at biological supply houses. It is not listed as a pathogen, but can cause res- piratory infections, bloo d poisoning and food poisoning.) According to declassified Army documents the Grey- hound terminals in San Francisco and Chicago were the location for \"six operatives to launch covert attacks\" spread over 7 days. Specially designed suitcases sprayed bacteria into crowded term inals for maximum exposure. Photographs were taken a nd other Army personnel \"covertly collected air samples in close proximity to the passengers\" to determine if the civilians had been infected (See photographs.) Later tests were repeated with smallpox agents, grown in large quantities and convert ed to a lethal powder for spraying. Senate investigation in 1975 revealed close cooperation between SOD and CIA: \"CIA associaiton with Fort Detrich involved the Spe- cial Operations Division (SOD) of that facility. This division was responsible for developing special applica- tions for biological warfare ag ents and toxins. Its prin- cipal customer was the U.S. Army. Its concern was with the development of both suit able agents and delivery mechanisms for use in paramilitary situations. Both standard biological warfar e agents and biologically derived toxins were inve stigated by the division.\" The Senate Committee found the CIA had covered its tracks to conceal this uncons titutional activity from the American public. The Senate Committee stated, \"Al- though some CIA originated documents have been found in the project files it is clear that only a very limited documentation of activities took place.\" An extract from a U.S. Army report details why small- pox was selected as the \"agent of choice.\" Its \"attractive\" features are listed as: 77"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"1. Smallpox is highly infectious with close contact It spreads readily from an infected person to susceptible individuals. 2.

Although the Federal Government claims that the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons stopped further use of Fort Detrich we know that the U.S. Army applied for $1.4 million appropriation to EXPAND germ warfare testing ability in the early 1980s. Senator James Sasser objected and it is unlikely th at the appropriation went through. It could have been handled on the \"black budget.\" The Originator of AIDS In July 1969 Dr. MacArthur, Di rector of the U.S. Army Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) appeared before Congress (the Appr opriations Committee of the House) and stated: \"within a period of 5-10 years it would be possible to produce a synt hetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired. This synthetic agent is AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency syndrome virus or HIV-1). ARPA requested $10 million to develop AIDS, 10 years before the virus was identified in the field Dr. MacArthur added, \"It is a highly controversial issue and there are many wh o believe such research should not be undertaken lest it lead to another method of massive killing of large populations.\" From 1961 to 1968 while this artificial biological agent was under discussion in the Pentagon, Trilateral Robert McNamara was Secretary of Defense. Clark Clifford (of BCCI notoriety) took over as Secretary in 1969. (Emphasis added.) 78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"On October 2, 1970, just 15 months after Dr. MacArthur requested an appr opriation for AIDS devel- opment, Robert McNamara, now World Bank President, made a speech to international bankers in which he identified population growth as \"the gravest issue that the world faces over the years ahead.\" In his speech to the banke rs, McNamara argued that population growth was leading to instability, that a 10 billion world population would not be \"controllable.\" Said McNamara, \"It is not a world that any of us would want to live in. Is such a world inevitable? It is not sure but there are two possibl e ways by which a world of 10 billion people can be averte d Either the current birth rates must come down more quickly or the current death rates must go up. There is no other way.\" In brief, Robert McNamara was in the final decision- making role for development of AIDS at the very time he was contemplating the idea that \"world death rates must go up.\" This is more than coincidence. Our conclusion is that Tril ateralist Robert McNamara knowingly encouraged development of AIDS as a means to reduce the world's population. It is difficult to arrive at any other conclusion, Soviet Union Charges Pentagon With AIDS Development This information became known to the Soviets and in October 1985 the Soviet Union mounted a worldwide propaganda campaign, AIDS had been manufactured at Fort Detrich, Maryland by the Pentagon, The initial information was planted in a Soviet-backed newspaper in India and then surfaced in more than 30 media sources worldwide. The report was backed by an East German report by Professor Jacob Sega l of Humbolt University, East Berlin. Segal argued that the AIDS virus is \"the product of an abortive experiment carried out at a laboratory to develop bi ological warfare means.\" This Soviet propaganda campaign was discounted in 79"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the West (this editor incl uded). It was beyond the realm of rationality that the U.S. would develop a killer agent such as AIDS. Professor Segal appears to hold the view that it was \"accidental,\" i.e. an \"abortive experiment.\" This position we also held for a while, until the McNamara speech of October 1970 surfaced. In any event, in the late 80's the U.S. State Depart- ment ran a rebuttal campaign to the Soviet charges. However, State was unaware that the Congress had published Dr. MacArthur's requ ests and statements so the rebuttal fell flat on its face. The State Department, for example, claims the U.S. Army had never used Fort Detrich as a biological warfare base. This is just not true. Further, State apparently had no knowledge of the McNamara contemplation of raising death rates by design. Conclusions 1. CIA-U.S. Army undertook fi eld tests with bacillus subtilis and smallpox against American civilians. 2. There is no question that the Army received funds from Congress for AIDS development and this was prob- ably undertaken at Fort Detrich. The AIDS release could have been accidental but we discount this for several reasons. Initial cases came from Africa and Haiti, not the United States.

One is the possibility of technologi cal surprise. Molecu lar biology is a field that is advancing very rapidly and eminent biologists believe that within a period of 5 to 10 years it would be possible to produce a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired. M R . S IKES . Are we doing any work in that field? D R . M AC A RTHUR . We are not. M R . S IKES . Why not? Lack of money or lack of interest? D R . M AC A RTHUR . Certainly not lack of interest. M R . S IKES . Would you provide for our records information on what would be required, what the advantages of such a program would be, the time and the cost involved? D R . M AC A RTHUR . We will be very happy to. (The information follows:) The dramatic progress being made in the field of molecular biology led us to investigate the relevance of this field of science to biological warfare. A small group of experts considered this matter a nd provided the following observations: 1. All biological agents up to the present time are representatives of naturally occurring disease, and are thus known by scientists throughout the world. They are easily available to qualified scientists for re search, either for offensive or defensive purposes. 2. Within the next 5 to 10 years, it would probably be possible to make a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from any known disease-causing organisms. Most important of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and ther apeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease. 3. A research program to explore the feasib ility of this could be completed in ap- proximately 6 years at a total cost of $10 million. 4. It would be very difficult to establish such a program. Molecular biology is a relatively new science. There are not many highly competent scientists in the field. Almost all are in university laboratories, and they are generally adequately sup- ported from sources other than DOD. Howeve r, it was considered possible to initi- ate an adequate program through the Na tional Academy of Sciences - National Research Council (NAS-NRC). The matter was discussed with the NAS-NRC, and tentative plans were made to initiate the program. However, decreasing funds in CB, growing criticism of the CB program, and our reluctance to involve the NAS-NRC in such a controversial endeavor have led us to postpone it for the past 2 years. It is a highly controversial issue and th ere are many who believe such research should not be undertaken lest it lead to yet another method of massive killing of large populations. On the other hand, wit hout the sure scientific knowledge that such a weapon is possible, and an understanding of the ways it could be done, there is little that can be done to devise defe nsive measures. Should an enemy develop it there is little doubt that this is an important area of potential military technological inferiority in which there is no adequate research program. 81"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Reprinted from a cartoon by Steve Benson in the Thursday, January 6, 1994 edition of the Arizona Republic. 82"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Pravda: October 31, 1986 \"The AIDS virus, a terrible disease with no cure was, accord- ing to western researchers, created in Pentagon laboratories.\" (SPID = AIDS) (At Bottom) \"Pentagon SPIDtsialist\" (In Russian, a play on the words \"SPID\" and \"specialist.\") 83"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"For more information see: (1) Lorraine Day, M.D., AIDS: What the Government Isn't Telling You, Rockford Press, P.O.

The \"war\" has had no effect on the supply of drugs, has not reduced demand for drugs, but has definitely been used to f und covert programs not author- ized by Congress and to line i ndividual official pockets. Under the Bush and Clinton administrations, the national \"war on drugs\" is a shoot-from-the-hip stumbling failure and a waste of taxpayer funds. This is not only a personal conclu- sion, it is a conclusion reac hed by police chiefs, medical researchers, sociologists, psyc hologists, syndicated column- ists and even by politicians. One can be excused if the conclu- sion is reached that the \"war\" is designed to fail What went wrong? â€¢ No one in any administratio n bothered to identify the problem in a realistic manner. . . each administration reacted in panic from a public outcry, unthinking and too late. â€¢ The drug abuse problem involve s perhaps 20 million Ame- ricans. Tsar Bennett wanted to build prisons to accommodate these 20 million errant citizens. . .but without facilities for cures. Additionally Bennett proposed gun control, curtailing civil rights and foster home s for children of abusers. â€¢ Two-thirds of the drug fighting budget is spent on mili- tary excursions... in Latin Amer ica and Colombia. . . also in 84"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Humboldt County, California, where for the first time possibly since the Civil War American troops have been used against Americans. â€¢ Of every ten aircraft intercepted, only one is a drug runner. . . the other nine are innocents. â€¢ A war of words is fought with incomplete, sometimes false, research information. â€¢ The end result of the Bush-Clinton war has been more violence, more homicides, an increase in drug use. . . and of course an increase in headline-catching drug busts. Some capsule comments: Washington D.C. Police Chief Isaac Fulwood: \"Bennett spends his time talking, not doing anything. Bennett's ap- proach is absolutely wrong. I don't even know if he has an approach.\" Washington D.C. Police Executive Research Forum (a think tank reflecting major city police chiefs): \"A clear need exists to expand and intensify the inquiry into both the medi- cal aspects of drug abuse and the efficacy of our current policy.\" If we had space we could print scores of critical comments from the medical side. Here's a couple of typical comments: Medical drug specialists are caustic in their criticism of on- going programs. Says Dr. Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medi- cal School: \"These ads (anti-drug ads) are totally irresponsible and they're scaring kids. When ki ds realize they've been had and not been told the truth, they'll backfire.\" The general assessment is that the program is a failure: Sta- tistician Susan Nissenbaum (Ca lifornia Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs), \"The gene ral consensus is that we're beginning to see an increase in the heroin problem.\" The latest medical research suggests that certain brain irregularities make some people much quicker to become addicted than others. . . and much harder to cure. Extensive well-controlled research suggests that some addicts take drugs to repair a defective brain chemistry, that persons subject to depression, anger, restlessness find the first dose of the drug immensely reinforcing, i.e. they are biologically pre- 85"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"disposed to a specific drug. Reports Ralph Tarter, a psycholo- gist at the Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh, many recovering drug abusers \"tell me the moment I took my first drug I felt normal for the first time.\" The New York Times (June 26, 1990) had an extensive article on biological predisposition. More generally, Newsweek (January 29, 1990) commented: \"After nine months the model for national action has turned out to be only a nasty battle of words.\" A predictable by-product of the Bennett war has been a distinct increase in violence and a dramatic increase in drug- related homicides. The undeniable increase in drug-related homicides is reported from New York, Miami, Houston, Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Oakland, Califor- nia, for example, tabulated 88 homicides by July 1990 (as opposed to 148 for all 1989) and 37 percent were drug related Another neglected aspect is that valium and codeine, legal- ly prescribed, are among the most addictive drugs and cause as many medical problems as illegally acquired drugs. An increasing reaction has been a demand for legaliza- tion ... to place cocaine and he roin on a par with cigarettes and alcohol, freely available with tax revenues going to the government instead of the dope dealers. This would certainly put the dealers out of business, and there would be no supply side left for the military excursion tactic. However, it would not so lve the medical problem: if cer- tain people are biologically disposed to drugs, then given the existing totally inadequate cure facilities we would end up with a medical overload instead of a legal enforcement overload Here the information is inadequate... we just don't know too much about how business losses are generated in relation to drugs. Is it the pressure to obtain money for drugs that leads to theft, embezzlement and inefficiency or do the drugs themselves make for the ineffi ciency? This is a significant point: in one case legalization would lead to fewer business losses, in the other it would lead to even more inefficiency. In brief: the shoot-from-the-hip Bush-Clinton approach wholly underestimates the complexity of the drug abuse 86"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"problem. However, the program does ach ieve what has long been feared. . . curtailment of hu man rights and constitutional rights, military action against Americans by Americans, prison camps for large numbers of Americans, domestic street violence... all under the name of fighting drug abuse. What's Happening at the Street Level IF the Bush-Clinton anti-drug crusade had been successful, supply would have dried up at the street level and prices sky- rocketed This has not come about. COCAINE is in plentiful supply. Police Departments around the country confirm this finding. Price dropped right after Bennett was appointed (as suppliers emptied their pipelines). Prices have now stabilized. Police Chief Fulwood (Washington, D.C.) states: \"We haven't seen any decrease in av ailability of drugs.\" A conti- nent away from Washington D.C, this author was walking along Market Street, San Franci sco, and saw a stocky white male at the corner of Powell and Market, where the tourists congregate for cable cars. . . who was shouting, \"Powder, Rocks\" (i.e., cocaine \"powder\" and crack \"rocks\"). This in broad daylight! HEROIN supply has increased and price has dropped sub- stantially.

Supply curtailment is a failure. In November 1993 the CBS-TV program 60 Minutes pro- duced dramatic evidence that our analysis is right on. DEA officials, including former DE A Chief Judge Bonner charged the CIA with importing one ton of pure cocaine in a single transaction from Venezuela. This was sold on American streets. This same CIA operation created the drug trafficking net- work in Haiti with \"intelligence network\" used as a cover and operating under General Cedras. One thousand pounds of the 1990 Venezuelan shipment was seized at the Miami Airpor t. DEA and Customs investi- gators were ordered to back off because the cocaine was im- ported with the approval of the United States Government. Moreover, Department of Jus tice knew about the shipment and did nothing. Senator Boren (Skull & Bones) knew about the shipment and did nothing. A Senator who represents the people of the United States closed his eyes. Only a few officials at DEA did their job! Culminating in the 1993 CBS program. (No U.S. newspaper printed this information until New York Times 11/20/93. Phoenix Le tter picked up some facts years ago, including information not on the CBS program, through the Caracas, Venezuela newspaper El Universal) The point is this, if one has knowledge of a drug shipment going to the United States, then legally one is required to report the facts. That means every one of these knowledge- able officials in CIA, Justice and State, plus Senator Boren, are guilty of trafficking. The street dealers who sold th is one ton of pure cocaine were no doubt routinely picked up and sentenced. The offi- 88"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"rials should also go to jail. After all, if a $20 street sale earns a prison sentence then so should importing one ton of pure cocaine. What has happened? You guessed it! Nothing. The White House is protecting everyone, which, given Tri- lateralist Clinton's involvement in Mena, Arkansas cocaine trafficking, should not surprise us. Senator Boren is protected by fellow Senators. We don't hear any calls for investigation of the Boren role. The ranking CIA official, Mark McFarlin, resigned. No charges filed. The assistant CIA official in charge of the shipment was \"disciplined,\" no charges filed. All State and Justice officials have been protected. What's the law? Here it is, as outlined by a Senior DEA official: \"If you are part of a drug shipment, and you have knowledge that it is going to the United States, you are culpable.\" \"Culpable?\" Yes, culpable of drug trafficking. So where is Attorney Janet Reno? Do we have a Constitu- tion or have we become just another Banana State petty dic- tatorship? One rule for the peasants and another for the privileged?

We do not recall any instance where government has acted honestly and brought right and honesty into the equation. The reaction has always been more cover up until the victim becomes the culprit. Today the United States is governed by a bunch of amoral whining money grubbers whose only concern is to keep intact their position at the public trough.

The credit for all U.S. policies in the past several decades, including these absurd \"wars\" on problems, is defin- itely with the Trilateral Commission. There is significant evidence published over the last two decades that the U.S. Government is involved in drug traf- ficking and that this trafficki ng is more than an accident. The largest cocaine laborator y in Bolivia was built and operated by CIA. Lt. Colonel \"Bo\" Gritz has charged and pro- duced evidence that the Golden Triangle, largest producer of heroin, has ties to Washington, D.C. 1 We know that CIA financed the Afghan rebels and the Nicaraguan \"contras\" through drug sales. There are in fact scores of such in- stances .... in brief, a large portion of trafficking is operated under official Washington approval. And we have demonstrated th at Washington, D.C, since the 1970s, has been under the cont rol of Trilateralists. . . and not coincidentally th e \"drug problem,\" th e so-called \"war on drugs,\" has been with us since the late 1970s. It was Trilateralist Henry Ki ssinger who developed \"crisis management\" â€” that crises can be used to move the world to New World Order.

Remarkably both Carter and C linton ran on a platform em- phasizing anti-Establishment policies while immediately and without hesitation appointing es tablishment representatives and then conducting long time establishment policies. The duplicitous procedures of both administrations is re- markable for its parallels rather than differences: both Carter and Clinton lied during the electio n process and told the elec- torate only what the electorate wanted to hear. When gaining office both Presidents proceeded to do the opposite in many cases to the policy promised during the election. Reagan and to a lesser extent Bush were more consistent in that policy tended to follow pr omises. However, both these Presidents also lied before and after taking office. If politicians in the United States complain they are held in low regard they have only themselves to blame. What we find extraordinary is that common sense suggests voters would turn to third parties. So far the electorate has been convinced that a third party could not win, without even considering the probability th at a strong third party vote would at least bring some hone sty to the morally bankrupt Democrats and Republicans. 91"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"A very large proportion of the electorate is now sitting on its hands, not voting. If this silent and considerable segment ever acts in unity, there w ill be a political revolution in the United States, and New World Order will take a massive tumble. The creation of a Carter ad ministration image of anti- Establishmentarianism while simultaneously creating a Tri- lateral administration is typically the deceptive operational approach taken by this self-appoint ed elite. Take the first half dozen appointments and look at their associations and allegi- ances. The administration was at some pains to show a com- petition for posts and promoted the idea that anti-Establish- ment and non-Establishment pe rsons would be appointed. See, for example, the Wall Str eet Journal on 2 December 1976 concerning the meeting of 16 candidates in Plains, Georgia. The initial sequence of a ppointments went like this: Appointment Number 1 - Bertra m Lance: president of Na- tional Bank of Georgia (Atlanta) to be director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Th is is a vital, central post for plans to centralize the U.S. economy. Appointment Number 2 - Cyrus Vance. Secretary of State, Trilateralist. At the time of taking office, Vance was a partner in Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett; a director of IBM, Pan American World Airways and Aetna Life Insurance; a mem- ber of the Democratic party, Foreign Policy Task Force, Council on Foreign Relations (v ice-chairman of the board), and the Trilateral Commission; and also a former deputy director of defense. Appointment Number 3 - W. Mi chael Blumenthal: Secretary of Treasury. Also a Trilateralist. Who is Blumenthal? Like Henry Kissinger, he was born in Germany and came to the U.S. at the age of 21. At the time of taking office, he was chairman of Bendix Corporation and formerly in the Kennedy administration as deputy for the secretary for economic affairs, member of the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Affairs, and the Initiative Committee for National Economic Planning (with Irwin Miller and Robert McNamara.) After this third appointment, th ere was definite feedback in newspapers and radio that the \"liberals\" felt they had been 92"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"betrayed because appointments and rumors of appointments did not include them. The result ? Jane Cahill Pfeiffer, vice president of IBM, strongly pushed for commerce secretary as Appointment Number 4, dropped out, and the next two ap- pointments went to big government liberals: Appointment Number 4 - Brock Adams: transportation sec- retary. Also a Trilateralist. Appointment Number 5 - Congr essman Andrew Young as Ambassador to the United Nations. Trilateral Appointment Number 6 - Zbigniew Brzezinski: executive director of Trilat eral Commission, was appointed national security adviser. Who is Brzezinski? By explicit statement, Trilateralists reject the Constitution and the democratic political process; in Between Two Ages, Brzezinski (Carter's sixth appointment) wrote as follows: The approaching two-hundred th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence could justify the call for a national constitutional conven tion to reexamine the na- tion's formal institutional framework. Either 1976 or 1989 â€” the two hundredth anniversary of the Constitu- tion â€” could serve as a suitable target date culminating a national dialogue on the relevance of existing arrange- ments. . . Realism, however, fo rces us to recognize that the necessary political innova tion will not come from direct constitutional reform, desirable as that would be. The needed change is more likely to develop incremental- ly and less overtly. . . in keeping with the American tra- dition of blurring di stinctions between public and private institutions. According to Huntington of Foreign Policy magazine, an \"election coalition\" may be ab andoned after political office has been achieved; a politician doe s not have to keep his word to the electorate. Jimmy Carter is a supreme example of Trila- teralism in practice. When Brzezi nski refers to \"develop(ing) incrementally and less overtly\" he is specifically recommend- ing a deceptive \"salami-type\" approach to abandonment of the Constitution. Perhaps some r eaders may consid er this to be the essence of subversion. If so, they had better do some- 93"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"thing about it, because no one in Congress has yet plucked up enough courage to even call for an investigation of Trilateralism. Clinton Abandons \"Election Coalition\" Trilateral Huntington's dictum that a politician may aban- don the \"election coalition\" after election to office, i.e., a politician may break his promises, has bypassed our jour- nalist investigators. Jimmy Carter broke promises right and left without much of a squeak from anyone. There appears to be a joint Demo- crat-Republican compact to i gnore the \"election coalition\" and keep out third parties, which is about as close as you can get to dictatorship without abandoning the Constitution. In January 1993, the same month Clinton took office, our newsletter, The Phoenix Letter, (a Report on the Abuse of Power) carried the followi ng front page article: Clinton Reeks of Conflict of Interest The American public has been suckered. . . again! Among the lavish Clinton promises to fix everything from health care to the deficit was above all a commitment to run the thieves and crooks out of Washington. Well, we have news for Clint on voters. Clinton was backed by the thieves and crooks and has appointed the self-same lobbyists he swore to run out of town to run the transition team. The political con game has become so blatant that Presidents don't even wait until the ink is dry on the ballot to break their promises. Before the election, we identified the background of Clinton's key financial backer, none other than Jackson Stephens, a founder of the Bank for Crooks and Criminals (BCCI), and the man who actually introduced Democratic elder statesman, Clark Clifford, to the BCCI crowd. We figure that one way or another, Stephens contributed $2 million to the Clinton campaign. And we are supposed to 94"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"believe that the BCCI whitewash won't continue! Then we looked at Clinton's transition team and found it headed and staffed by Washington lawyers and lobbyists, the very people that Clinton said he would remove, those whose client lists and board director ships covered just about every major corporation and many foreign countries. Who is represented in Washington? You and I? Not likely. Many of the transition team clients have matters pending before regulatory bodies and the Congress itself. Then to emphasize the hypocrisy, the transition team introduced new ethics \"rules\" to supposedly limit \"the influence of lobbyists\" and to be rigidly enforced. All well and good, except that at time of writing, it has been impossible to obtain a set of these rules. (Released December 10, see below.) During the election, Clinton repeatedly called for limits on lobbyists. \"We've got to clean it up. We're all going to have to change,\" said candidate Clinton. \"Business as usual,\" says elected Clinton. A Huge Scaly Serpent Crawling Through the Corridors of Congress Politicians, lobbyists, college professors of political science and their textbooks all tell us that lobbying is essential, a necessary function of society to make democracy work. The conventional view is that lobbying is harmless and useful in that it makes all viewpoints heard. Hogwash! Individual voting citizens are those represented in Congress by their elected representatives. Congressmen and women are not elected by corporations or foreign inter- ests, they are elected by individual American voters. It is American citizens that are elected, not the dairy interests or the water interests or the welf are interests of some way off foreign country. Certainly Joe Dairy Farmer has representa- tion as an individual, but the collected interests have no col- lective vote and should have no representation in Congress. In practice, lobbying has become the conduit for pressure groups. And every so-called reform has left gigantic loopholes 95"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"to continue the process of lobbying. Lobbyists now place money on both sides (Democrat and Republican) and fight smaller parties because they would then have to lay out money on more parties to guarantee representation. The political process has b ecome an outright fraud. The individual American has beco me disenfranchised. The power groups and foreign interests have become power holders working through a compliant Congress. And from what we can see, th e \"new\" Congress will be little different from the old. Reportedly, Clinton was shocked at the public reaction to the appointed transition team, and instructed staff to draft lobbying rules. These rules were drafted and succeeded only in rejecting one transition aide from one meeting for conflict of interest. Even then the Clinton White House refused to release copy of the new \"rules\" until December 10. The transition director, Trila teralist Warren M. Chris- topher, is senior partner in O'Melveny and Myers, with a heavy Far East client list incl uding Mitsui, Sumitomo Trust, Japan Airlines and Hyundai. Ch ristopher has more interest in representing Japanese intere sts than the American down home. In fact, just to illustrate the hypocrisy, during the campaign, Clinton pointedly cr iticized American law firms who work for foreign interests. Once elected, Clinton picked on this foremost representa- tive of foreign interests to act as director of the transition. Warren Christopher is on the board of Lockheed Aircraft but is not (under the Clinton rule s) in conflict of interest on military matters in the Clinton Administration. The Clinton rules do not bar Christopher from discussing Asian matters on behalf of his clients. What is the Clinton defense to such charges? Simply that there is no conflict of interest because the connection between these officials' advice and their ability to profit is \"too diffuse\" and that Mr. Clinton, no t his transition advisors, will make the final decisions. Lobbyists themselves are under no illusion that the \"rules\" have not changed The firm of Patton, Boggs and Blow pub- 96"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"lishes a newsletter in which it openly boasts of its contacts within the Democratic Party and Washington power circles, and indeed has two partners close to the Democratic Party: Democratic Party Chief Ro n Brown and Thomas Boggs. Then we find Lefitia Chambers, who is transition overseer on budget issues, who in real life is lobbyist for AFL-CIO, home builders and senior citizens. The results of this system can be seen in billion dollar wasteful expenditures: â€¢ The State of Virginia, as reported in November Phoenix Letter, has a disproportionate share of Federal funds guided to Virginia by the \"King of Pork.\" â€¢ Extraordinary waste of money in technical expenditures: for example, the billion dollar \"Hot fusion\" program. â€¢ Neglect of programs that have no powerful voice in Congress. Most of the \"future technology\" reported in FTIR (Future Technology Intelligence Report, P.O. Box 423652, San Francisco, CA 94142-3652) is ignored by financiers. The rules announced on December 10 and hailed by obser- vers as pathbreaking are no more than a further whitewash. Officials may be personally banned from lobbying for five years, but what about their partners? These are exempt The lifetime ban on foreign company lobbying has no meaning in practice. The only sure fire solution is complete and final ban on all lobbying, except that of individual private citizens or their own elected representative. Corporations and law firms do not vote. Individuals do. When Mr. Clinton adopts this standard, we shall see the scaly serpent crawl back out of Washington, D.C. NAFTA â€” Step to New World Order Multinationals well represented on the Trilateral Commission aim to dominate world production and trade. The enormous pressure behind the NAFTA agreement, to bring the U.S., Mexico and Canada into a tariff-free commun- ity, was motivated by New World Order.

Initial reaction was from Chiapas, Mexico, the revolt of Indians against Mexican authority. The Indians, already hard-pressed, unable to sell th eir coffee on the world market, now find that the Mexican Government support structure was dismantled, and their domestic corn crop could not com- pete against imported U.S. corn. NAFTA was the last straw. Another result still to emerge will be Mexican meat ex- ports. U.S. giant meat firms will go to Mexico to take advan- tage of low wages, poor safety standards and lax sanitation regulation. We will see a flood of imported Mexican beef, with the identity of U.S. firms hidden behind a Mexican import label. NAFTA exempts Mexico from the U.S. Import Act to benefit GIANT U.S. firms. NAFTA was an end-run by U.S. multinationals around U.S. regulation. Clinton promised to appoint more meat inspectors as a cover to disguise the reality. The end result will be to hurt smaller U.S. ranchers and to expose U.S. citizens to uninspected beef. Mexico is now highly advantag eous for Trilateral firms like General Electric (Vice Chairman Paolo Fresco is a Trilateral), Motorola (Chairman George M. C. Fisher is a Trilateral), Levi Strauss (Robert D. Haas is a Trilateral and close to David Rockefeller), Mobil Corporation (Allen Murray, Chairman, is Trilateral), and several major pharmaceutical companies (Johnson and Johnson, Smith Kline Beecham). NAFTA will spur U.S. firms into Mexico to take advantage of lower regulatory stan dards and low wage rates. NAFTA is an essential part of the Trilateral plan to reduce U.S. living standards and transf er benefits overseas to less developed countries. Trilateral Clinton was able to do this because the media have their Tr ilateral members who act as guides for smaller circulation ne wspapers and stations (CNN Chairman W. Thomas Johnson is a Trilateral, so is Katharine Graham, Chairman of the Wash ington Post, among others). The U.S. citizen doesn't stand a chance, faced with this array of like-minded conspirato rs.

Much of the thinking behi nd Trilateralism comes from early concepts put forward by Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner with funds from South African gold and diamond mines. Rhodes founded the Rhodes Scholarships to bring Americans with specific personality traits to Oxford University for one year. Bill Clinton became a Rh odes scholar after studying under Carroll Quigley at Georgetown University. Carroll Quigley wrote a ma ssive volume, Tragedy and Hope, which described New Worl d Order plans. Quigley was not a defector; he agreed with the objectives of an Anglo- American New World Order. Where he parted company was that he believed this should be an open objective, not a closed secretive conspiracy. So the Rhodes organization a nd the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London are essential parts of the New World Order. The RIIA spawned the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, a broader-based but still limited organization with the same objectives. Our observa- tion is that CFR has a wider range of views among its mem- bers, some even against New World Order, than does the Trilateral Commission or the RIIA. 101"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The interesting aspect of CFR is that David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission, was long time Chair- man of CFR and is today Chairman Emeritus.

Another more restricted segm ent of New World Order is the truly secret Skull & Bones Se nior Society at Yale. Fifteen years ago this author obtained a copy of the secret member- ship list (a two-volume black leather-bound affair) and was able to analyze in depth the influence and extent of Skull & Bones in the U.S. government. This was published as America's Secret Establishment 1 and is still in print today. Loose Backgrounds of New World Order Types Almost every proponent of New World Order from its very earliest days has some kind of shady past cert ainly not in keeping with the high ideals professed. Cecil Rhodes himself was accu sed of deception and crook- ery in gaining control of the gold and diamond mines of South Africa. His partner, Lord Milner, was the author of the infam- ous \"Milner Telegram\" which br ought about the Anglo-Boer War in 1899. The Rhodes diamond mines becam e the core of the DeBeers monopoly and still today maintains monopoly control of world diamonds â€” a model for New World Order. Cecil Rhodes' own image of a New World Order was hardly inspiring to any but Anglo Americans. The second largest language group in the world is Spanish speaking â€” and you won't find a single Latin in a ny New World Order organiza- tion. In fact, so far as the Trila teral Commission is concerned, Latins don't exist who warrant membership in the Commis- sion. You won't find Arabs, either , or Chinese re sident in the Far East. Now this might be comforting to the English-speaking world but disparities of this kind are guaranteed to lead to 1 Obtainable from Liberty House Books, P.O.

If Latins, Arabs, Chin ese, Russians and others are delegated to subordinate positions in New World Order, the outcome will be conflict, not peace. Then the individual and corpor ate histories of Trilateral members and firms are hardly reassuring. We couldn't find a single individual or firm wher e some investigation had not been started for illegal conduct. Take as a random example a firm mentioned only once above â€” Prudential Securities Company. Robert C. Winters, Chairman of the Board of Prudential, is a Trilateral. As we go to press, Prudential is under investigation on several charges. Apparently Prudential brokers ha d orders to deceive custo- mers (New York Times, 2/28/94 ) and some brokers even quit rather than go along. Prudential is the focus of a widening criminal inquiry relating to the way customers were treated when the firm was suffering enormous losses. A few years ago Wall Street brokerage firms could main- tain zero balance accounts, funds were deposited only when the bank called. This is also known as ch eck kiting. If you and I did it we would end up in ja il. The brokerage firms got off scot-free and made millions a y ear from the practice. E. F. Hutton was the major player in this con game. Kissinger Associates, an infl uence-peddling outfit founded by Henry Kissinger to capitalize on his \"public service\" has more than once come into unfavorable criticism but his mem- bership of the Trilateral Commission is carefully screened out of reports. The firm had a field day, for example, in the bankruptcy of LTV Corporation where $144 million went to consultants for professional services related to the bankruptcy, and Kis- singer Associates got the lion's share. The gross overcharging was never investigated. Similarly, the BCCI affair, a worldwide scandal to which Kissinger Associates was linked, managed to evade investi- gation in the United States. In England where many thou- sands lost deposits, only a lowe r level manager went to jail. 103"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Friends of Hillary The Clintons have proved th emselves remarkably adept at promoting their own private interests at public expense â€” and especially in acquiring \"friends\" in need of Government favors who can show a little appreciation. The fascinating difference between the Clintons and almost any other political family we can think of is the vehement, almost breast-beating denunciati on of influence peddlers and lobbyists. Yet these are the \"friends\" that come to show their appreciation. The New York Times (March 31,1994) commented caustic- ally on \"Arkansas, where a thousand or so insiders run things in a loosey-goosey way that may look unethical or even illegal to outsiders.\" Apparently, Arkansas morality is, for the Clintons, distinct from Washington morality and they cannot be accused of irregular conduct because that would discrimin- ate against Arkansas. The really breathtaking \"loosey-goosey\" event that bene- fited the Clintons was Hillary's ability to take $1,000 as a complete novice without collate ral and with naked market exposure, and convert it into $100,000 in cattle futures â€” a notoriously unstable market. Hillary did this in ten months with only $1,000 in a margin account (this would normally re quire at least $10,000) and faced disastrous losses any day or hour if the market turned sour on her investment. Moreover, Hillary went through specific market moves with results which are impossible unless her broker was mak- ing illegal actions on her behalf. Hillary's broker was Robert L. (Red) Bone of the Ray E. Friedman & Company brokerage firm of Chicago. In October 1978 she opened a trading account with $1,000. The very first day this investment went to $6,300. There is no documenta- tion for the trades, and there is no way that $1,000 would cover the amount of cattle futur es trades needed to make that amount of profit. 104"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"House Speaker Thomas Foley (Trilateral) House Speaker Thomas Foley is a disgrace.

It was agreed â€” no meetings or h earings on Whitewater under any circumstances. That put non-Trilateral Congre ssman John La Falce, Chair- man of the Small Business Committee, on the spot. La Falce had already started an inves tigation and requested docu- ments from the Small Busi ness Administration.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This view is another Karl Marx fundamental misinterpretation of the 19th century world. Lenin, who followed Marx as tactician of the world revolutionary battle, was more perceptive and saw capitalists as shortsighted, with many willing to supply the rope to hang themselves. The Rockefeller group of Wall St reet financiers and their associated banks, Chase, Manhattan and then Chase Man- hattan Bank, have always been in the forefront of capitalists willing to aid and succor Marxism. This suicidal policy con- tinued under various Presidents who owe election to the Rockefeller family, i.e. Carter and Clinton, and the Trilateral Commission. A fundamental Trilat eral policy is one world interdependence, a merging of Marxism and capitalism under Trilateral leadership. The Rockefeller family has shown notable ability to first conceal its support of Marxism before and after World War II and then conceal its promotion of Trilateralism in recent dec- ades. Historians have been unwitting supporters of the Rockefeller family objectives by continuing to advance the 107"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"theoretical dialectic view of an historical antagonism of com- munism vs. capitalism as the actual nature of events. The true history is a history of cooperation between elite political leaders of the West and various Marxist regimes. The West has used debt and technology to more or less control these ineffective Marxist societies. Trilateralism is merely contin uation of this global decep- tion, and fools historians as well as voters. We are in a period where Marxist regimes are allowe d to find their own level of instability, i.e. effectively to collapse, while new forms of world control are substituted. New World Order via Trila- teralism is 21st Century Marxism. Let's briefly review the history of elitist support of Marx- ism and Trilateralism to achieve New World Order. This began, by the way, with Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner in Eng- land, founders of the Rhodes scholarships at Oxford. Presi- dent Clinton is a Rhodes scholar and understands at least part of the picture. (A fascinating research topic, never under- taken, would be to explore the contacts between Rhodes, Milner and the Fabians in London with Karl Marx, who worked most of his life in London in the same period. The start point for any interested researcher would be the Scot- land Yard files on Karl Marx.) Back in the 1920s the Chase National Bank (Chase National merged with the Bank of Manhattan to become Chase Man- hattan) was deeply involved in building the Soviets â€” and some of this activity was probably illegal and certainly against U.S. official policy. Both Chase National and Equitable Trust were the leaders in the Soviet credit business at a time in the 1920s when the State Department had banned credits to Soviet Russia. Chase evaded the ban by accepting platinum from Soviet mines and advancing credit on the basis of these shipments. This was strictly against U.S. policy in the 1920s. The president of the American-Russian Chamber of Com- merce in the 1920s was Reeve Schley, also a vice-president of Chase National. The Chamber was a pressure group which sought to change U.S. policy into recognition of the USSR, to 108"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"open up the Russian market for some major American firms and banks. To this end, the Chamber used avowed commun- ists as agents; for example, a Chamber delegation to Russia in 1936 was led by Charles Haddell Smith, previously described by the State Department as \"in the employ of the Soviets and a member of the Soviet Peasant International.\" Members of the Chamber included many of the firms opening up the China trade today, including Deere & Co., Westinghouse and Chase National. In the early 1920s the Soviet Union was on the verge of col- lapse. The only industrial stru cture was that of the Tsars. Industry was dormant, not destroyed as Soviet propagan- dists would have us believe. Fo reign firms, mainly American and German, came in to start up a dormant Tsarist industry and remained to build the Five Year Plans. Why? Because the Soviets had destroyed the skilled engineers and managers needed to run industry. As Soviet Commissar Krassin phrased the problem: \"Anyone can help pull down a house; there are but a few who can rebuild. In Russia there happened to be far fewer than anywhere else.\" Take the example of Boeing Aircraft (Trilateral T.W. Wilson is chairman of the board). In the 1930s Boeing sup- plied technical assistance to the growing Soviets. The Soviet I-16 fighter was patterned on the Boeing P-26. The Soviet TU-4 four-engine bomber was a copy of the Boeing B-29 and could only have been reproduced with U.S. assistance. Today Boeing is a one-time supplier of aircraft technology to the Soviet Union and to Communist China, and remains represen- ted on the Trilateral Commission. Another example is UOP (Universal Oil Products), now a subsidiary of Signal Oil Company. In 1932 UOP had con- tracts in the USSR for construction of hydrogenation plants, which were of vital importance for military purposes. Up to 1938 the Soviets were unable to produce 87-94 octane gaso- line for aviation use. Hydrogenation plants built by UOP con- verted 85 octane gasoline from Saratov and Grozny into 95 octane avgas. Today, UOP is one of the first American firms into China to build the Chinese petrochemical industry â€” also 109"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"vital for war purposes. Yet another example is Ingersoll-Rand, which was repre- sented in the Soviet Un ion by Armand Hammer (former chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) as early as 1918. At that time Armand Hammer's father, Julius Ham- mer, was secretary of the Comm unist Party U.S.A. Ingersoll- Rand became a prime seller of t echnology to the U.S.S.R. In 1979, Ingersoll-Rand is following the same road with Com- munist China. We can cite dozens of firms with similar stories. U.S. multi- nationals built Soviet power. This has cost the United States hundreds of thousands of lives in Korea and Vietnam. Now these same multinationals have begun to build Communist China under the initial push from Trilateral President Jimmy Carter. The most important and largest China contracts link to Tri- lateralists and their corporate affiliates: The key financial backer of Jimmy Carter was Coca-Cola chairman and Trila- teral Commissioner J. Paul Austin. Coca-Cola will have a soft dr ink monopoly in China. Maybe the Chinese don't yet know what a soft drink tastes like, but 800 million Chinese is a prime market for the 21st century. NOTE: Coca-Cola had been negotiating for ten years before 1979 with the Chinese, i.e., long before any public surfacing of a \"new\" China policy and presumably while the Chinese aided the killing of Americans in Vietnam. â€¢ A consortium of U.S. oil companies has negotiated devel- opment of Chinese petroleum resources. These include Exxon (David Rockefeller has dominant interests), Pennzoil, Phillips and Union Oil. â€¢ Former Time Magazine Man-of-the-Year was the Chinese Communist leader, Teng Hsiao- Ping. Trilateralist Hedley Donovan was editor-in-chief of Time. â€¢ The first American banks into Communist China were Chase Manhattan and the Firs t National Bank of Chicago. â€¢ Japanese Trilaterals are heavily involved in construction of Communist China. The Carter Administration agreement with Communist 110"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"China, the so-called \"normali zation\" of relations, was an extraordinary treaty. All the Chinese terms, including those rejected by Presidents Nixon a nd Ford, were totally accepted by the Trilateral negotiations. The negotiators were Trila- terals. On the spot in Pe king was Leonard Woodcock. In Washington was Cyrus Vance and Warren Christopher (under-Secretary of State for Ea st Asian and Pacific Affairs, now Secretary of State). There was no pressure to make an agreement at this time from the strategic or political viewpoint â€” so we must look to the multinationals for an answer. What do they gain? Was the China treaty a duplicate of th e early 1920-30 Soviet agree- ment? A device to fill multinational order books and expand the loan base of international banks? The United States was in an extremely strong bargaining position. The Chinese needed U.S. technology to survive. They needed U.S. credits to buy technology. They needed the U.S. as an ally against Russian intrusions over the Chinese border; and recognition by the U.S. gave the Chinese Com- munists a status they could ach ieve in no other way. Yet the United States capitulated without a whimper, very much like the Vietnamese situation when the U.S. got sucked into a major war without plan or purpose. Some 50,000 Americans were killed. Then we abandoned the battlefield at a time when we still had the absolute capability to finish the military job. In other words, we did not apparently know why we were in Vietnam in the first place. When we were involved, we spent billions on war materials and even then lacked the will to use those weapons. In these instances and others we can find a common thread, a common explanation. In science, the answer that most like- ly is true, is that answer which fits the largest number of cases or events. Is there profit for Wall Street in recognizing Communist China? Was there also profit in $300 billion of Vietnamese military contracts? In the same way there was profit in saving the Soviets and building the Soviet Five Year Plan? This is the simplest, most plausible answer. It fits most 111"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"cases â€” and this is where Tril ateralism comes in. Trilateral- ism is the vehicle by whic h some banking interests and multinationals carry out their policy objectives. The Trilateral opening to Comm unist China also reveals a total failure to recognize the human cost of Chinese Com- munism. Conservatively, China has murdered 50 million Chinese in the 30 years of the Revolution. During one particular campaign, \"Let a Mi llion Flowers Bloom,\" Chinese Communists lifted their restricti ons on freedom of speech and action. Many Chinese then took the bait to criticize the regime. After a few months of freedom of speech the Chinese government promptly arrested the dissidents and used their own words as evidence to send them to labor camps, prisons, or to their death. These big businessmen have a habit of telling each other how non-political and smart they ar e to ignore civil and social conditions while concentrati ng on the business at hand. The profit statement is the guide: In brief, an utter, complete amorality. The dangerous illusions Tril aterals hold about Russia and China do not therefore stem fr om ignorance of the facts â€” their actions stem from extreme short-sightedness and amorality. The next contract for a multinational has total precedence over any nonsense about human rights. While, for example, Trilateral J. Paul Austin may want to sell Coca-Cola to 800 million Chinese, Austin has no interest in what hap- pened to tens of millions of the less fortunate Chinese. The outright betrayal of Taiwan in the clear, stark words in the official agreement reads as follows: \"The government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese posi- tion that there is but one China, and Taiwan is part of China.\" It is difficult to find any histor ical parallel where a country has acknowledged the slaughter of 50 million people by creat- ing an alliance with that count ry. Possibly the closest parallel is Hitler's alliance with St alin in 1939 afte r Stalin had murdered millions of peasants and Hitler had begun to move against his enemies much as th e Trilaterals are moving today against their own particular enemies. 112"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"At this point we should note the official Trilateral double standard on human rights. In brief, for Trilaterals' human rights are subordinate to thei r overall objective of world control.

Some Trilateral conceptions of detente with the Soviet Union and other communist states tend to conflict with a policy of promoting human rights. (Richard N.

Interestingly, the Clintons fit the description of \"break- away capitalists\" formulated by Lenin. . . i.e., a group of capitalists who see pecuniary advantage in Marxism and so support the Marxist cause. Obviously the Clintons have no aversion to moneymaking us ing the political process; Hillary's cattle futures trading and Arkansas activities are excellent examples. Yet while making capitalistic profit we also find Hillary supporting Ma rxist causes... in exactly the same manner as the Rockefeller Chase Bank in the 1920s. In the case of the Clintons, the evidence is somewhat more serious because, according to recently releas ed FBI docu- ments (reprinted below) a C linton-supported pro-Marxist organization, IPS (Institute fo r Policy Studies) is suspected of bank robbery and murder.

Our interpretation is somewhat different to the ge neral conservative interpreta- tion.

We see the Clintons as cultivating and financing IPS for future personal gain, not because they had Marxist leanings. These revelations of a co mmunist-oriented IPS vet- eran (Derek Shearer) direc tly influencing Clinton, and Clinton entrusting the country 's future to numerous other IPS supporters, is grim indeed and does not bode well for the Nation. But there are many more such dis- turbing revelations yet to be fathomed. These additional evidences â€” which even more firmly cement Bill Clinton into the camp of IPS subversives â€” come through Hillary Clinton. If the only links Hillary had to IPS were her close friendship with Derek Shearer 's sister and her furrow- browed fling at Yale, such c ould appear quite incidental But unfortunately, there are additional reams of hard evi- dence which indict Hillary as a motivated IPS champion. For example, while serving as Director and Chair of the Board of Directors of th e New World Foundation in 1987-88, Hillary Clinton praised and gave away signifi- cant sums of money to severa l far left organizations â€” including IPS.

(page 37) IPS Suspected of Bombings and Murder The IPS has long been suspected of revolutionary activities and this must have been known to the Clintonsâ€”and especially to Hillary Clinton, who financed IPS in part. Foundation fund disbursers make themselves aware of recipients' backgrounds. In 1971 the IPS was under investigation by the FBI \"for possible involvement of IPS associates in bombing matters\" (see documents reproduced below) and \"a connection has been shown between the subjects of a bank robbery-murder and some IPS associates.\" (This related to the murder of a police officer on September 23, 1970 during robbery of the State Street Bank and Trust Company in Boston.) At precisely this time in 1970, Hillary Clinton was associ- ated with Robert Borosage, Dir ector of the IPS. . . and ten years later we find Hillary still associated with and financing IPS Marxist causes. If writers on the outside of IPS can determine IPS' revolu- tionary violent nature, then so can a Yale lawyer with inside contacts at IPS. We have to assume that either Hillary Clinton is remarkably naive or was aware of the violent nature of the IPS when she directed funds into the IPS and related organizations. When we consider the FBI documents reproduced below with the additional materials in SECRET, this writer has serious reservations about Hillary Clinton. Anyone who would finance or aid violent activities is unstable and certainly not fit to influence public policy in a free country. SECRET comments on public reaction to some of these revelations as follows: On CNN's Capital Gang columnist Mona Charen cited Hillary's radicalism but was interrupted by Al Hunt, Chief of the Washington Bureau of the Wall Street Journal, \"It's utter, complete nonsense. You don't have 116"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"anything factual\" blurted Hunt Charen replied, \"No, it's based on her foundation grants to CISPES and William Kunstler.\" Hunt stormed, \"No, that is the far-right American Spectator kind of neo-fascist hit nonsense.\" After Rush Limbaugh raked Hunt over the coals over 500 radio stations for that sophomoric name-calling spree, a humbled and much sm arter Al Hunt scraped out an apology, offering that, \"It would be outrageous for me or anyone else to smear [The American Spectator] with that pejorative label.\" Regardless how uneasy the truth makes persons such as Al Hunt, Hillary Clinton's political activities are as relevant as the political act ivities of any first lady. If Eleanor Roosevelt had (befor e, after or during WWII) channeled money to Japan's military supporters, that would have been relevant. If Bess Truman had directed monies to North Korea's advocates, that would have been relevant. If Jackie Ke nnedy had aided Castro or if \"\"Lady Bird' Johnson had supported the Viet Cong, those actions would have been relevant; as would news of Barbara Bush funding Sadam Hussein's forces. Likewise, Hillary's support for pro-Marxists in Amer- ica and for communist insurgents in Nicaragua and El Salvador is just as relevant! Especially in light of the Clinton campaign rhetoric that he and Hillary would be somewhat of a husband-and-wi fe Presidential team. As Hillary declared at the New York Convention, \"With me you are getting two for the price of one.... Vote for him and you will have me also. The Trilateral Commission then is a prime Rockefeller front to control policy to bring about New World Order. Through the Clintons the decades-old pol icy of aid to Marxist regimes and revolutionaries continues. This is a long way from the \"study group\" label claimed by the Trilateral Commission.

Here's another seg- ment of the same radio interview of Mr. Franklin, in which he disclaims knowledge of a Trilateral book recommending abridgement of press freedoms, a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. S UTTON : Mr. Franklin, do you believe in freedom of the press in the United States? F RANKLIN : Definitely, of course. S UTTON : Let me quote you from a book, Crisis In Democracy, written by Michel Crozier, who is a Trilateral member. F RANKLIN : Correct. S UTTON : I am quoting from page 35 of his book: \"The media has thus become an autonomous power. We are now witnessing a crucial change with the profession. That is, media tends to regulate itself in such a way as to resist the pressure from financial or government interests.\" Does that not mean that you want to restrict the press in some way? F RANKLIN : I can't quite hear you. S UTTON : Let me paraphrase this for you. I think I will be clear in my paraphrasing. The Trilateral Commission is unhappy with the press because it resists the pressure from financial or government interests. That is one of your statements. 121"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"F RANKLIN : N OW , let me say something about our book. [NOTE: \"our\"] The book that we put out, the report, is the responsibility of the authors and not of the Commission itself. You will find that in the back of a number of them, and that book is one of them, that other members of the Commission will hear dissenting views, and you will find dissenting views in the back of that book on the press question. S UTTON : I would like to quote a further statement from the same book and leave the question at that point: \"The media deprives government and to so me extent other responsible authorities of the time lag and tolerance that make it possible to innovate and to experiment responsibly.\" What the book recommends is something like the Interstate Commerce Com- mission to control the press. This seems to me to be a violation of the Constitution. F RANKLIN : I would agree with you that we do not want some- thing like the Interstate Commerce Commission to control the press. [Michel Crozer, et al, in Crisis In Democracy, make the following statements with refe rence to the \"Interstate Com- merce Act and the Sherman Anti-trust Act\": \"Something comparable appears to be now needed with re- spect to the media. .. there is also the need to assure to the government the right and the ability to withhold information at the source\" (page 82). The authors go on to argue that if journalists do not con- form to these new restrictive sta ndards, then \"The alternative could well be regulation by the government. \"] S UTTON : I fail to understand why the Trilateral Commission would associate itself with such a viewpoint. F RANKLIN : As I just mentioned to you, we hired three authors for each report. The authors ar e allowed to say what they think is correct. What the Trilateral Commission does is this: It says we think this report is worthwhile for the public to see. This does not mean that all the members of the Commission agree with all the statements in the report and, in fact, a majority of them might disagree with certain things. Now, 122"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"where a statement is one that many Commissioners seem to disagree with, we then do put in the back a summary of the discussion. That book does have a summary of the discussion of our meeting which questions various things in the book, in the back of it. While Mr. Franklin tries to put distance between the Trila- teral Commission and individual members, he then admitted to a \"common philosophy\" which appears to suggest they have common views on at least fundamental issues. S UTTON : Would you say Mr. Franklin that the members of the Commission do have a common philosophy? F RANKLIN : Yes, I think a common philo sophy. I think that all of them believe that this world will work better if the principal industrial powers consult each other on their policies and try to work them out together. This does not mean that they will agree on everything. Of course, they won't. But, at least they will know what the other countries feel, and why they feel it. S UTTON : The Financial Times in Londonâ€”the editor is Ferdy Fisher, a Trilateralist. He fired a long time editorial writer, Gordon Tether, because Tether wanted to write articles criti- cizing the Trilateral Commission. Do you have any comments? F RANKLIN : I didn't know that at all. It sounds terribly unlikely, but if you say that it is so, probably it is. [See Chapter Seven, \"Trilateral Censorship: the case of C. Gordon Tether\" in Trilaterals Over Washington. Trilaterals see the media as the \"gatekeeper\" and comment as follows: \"Their main impact is visibility. The onl y real event is the event that is reported as seen. Thus, journa lists possess a crucial role as gatekeepers of one of the central dimensions of public life. \"] George Franklin got into further deep water about control of the press when asked how it chose writers and whether it approved of the chosen writers. R EES : Yes, Mr. Franklin, I noticed that you were saying that the Trilateral Commission takes no responsibility for the use 123"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"of the publisher's imprimatur, but I would be interested to know about how you go about sel ecting your writers to put out the various positions. F RANKLIN : Well that is a very interesting question. We have a meeting with the chairmen. The way the situation is organ- ized is this. There are three chairmen, one from each of the three areas. Three secretaries, one from each of the three areas, and I, have got an interm ediate staff job called \"coordi- nator.\" Now, the chairmen and secretaries meet with what they have jointly, will discuss not only topics they think will be useful to have, but also au thors for these topics. The topics are then discussed by the whole Commission and approved or changed slightly. The authors are chosen by members of the staff and consultation with the chairmen. R EES : S O , although you do not take r esponsibility for the fin- ished product you are responsible for the selection of the writers. F RANKLIN : Very much. No question about that. R EES : S O it does have your imprimatur stamp of approval each time? F RANKLIN : In that sense. We certainly choose the writers, and we choose them because we think they are very good, obvi- ously. So far, every single report that has been written by the authors has, in fact, been accepted for publication by the Commission. R EES : Then the report on the news media was accepted? F RANKLIN : It was accepted, but there was a lot of dis- agreement with that. It was felt that it was an important statement, with quite a lot of interesting new ideas in it. It was also a very strong opposition which was reflected in the back of the report in a section, I think it is entitled, \"Summary of Discussion.\" Whatever Mr. Franklin's evasive statements, common sense suggests that Trilateral reports do in fact reflect a com- mon philosophy, else the Commission would hardly pay out funds for their production. The \"do not necessarily agree with 124"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"the authors\" is a mere ploy to evade responsibility for unwelcome views. In one sensitive area, the abnor mally low tax rates paid by Trilateral banks and firms, Ge orge Franklin Jr. was highly evasive â€” and for good reason. Tr ilaterals have been getting away with murder, taxwise. Here's the Council Bluffs segment on taxation: C OMMENTATOR : Mr. Sutton, do you have any other questions? S UTTON : I have one more question, that goes to a new field entirely: taxation. We have established that David Rocke- feller is chairman and single most powerful influence in Chase Manhattan Bank. Now, do you happen to know the tax rate that Chase Manhattan pays in the United States? F RANKLIN : I don't know. . . happen to know â€” it is about 50% (fifty percent), S UTTON : I will give you some figures. In 1976, Chase Manhat- tan Bank's tax rate was precisel y zero. I am wondering why, if you are so influential politically, why at least you cannot pay a tax rate more equivalent to that of the average American taxpayer, which is 15%, or 20% or 30%. F RANKLIN : I have nothing to do with Chase Manhattan Bank. But if the tax rate was zero, it must have been because it had very large real estate losses in that year, I think. S UTTON : In 1975, it was 3.4%. It is always way under 10%. F RANKLIN : Well, that is extremely interesting. It is a new fact for me. S UTTON : Well, my point is this, that you are willing to guide the United States into the future, but apparently you are not willing to pay your fair share of the costs. C OMMENTATOR : Y OU are talking about the Commission mem- bers as a whole? S UTTON : Yes. F RANKLIN : I think you will find that the Commission mem- bers pay whatever the laws say they are supposed to pay under the circumstances. I do not know what the particular 125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"reason was on Chase. They did have heavy losses; I am not familiar enough with their situati on to be able to tell to you. In brief, our Trilateral friends have been dealing themselves favors when it comes to taxation. Trilateral firms are notori- ous for the ridiculous low tax ra tes they appear to pay, zero being quite common. And it's all legal because Tr ilateral poli- cies are put into law by Trilat eral politicians â€” so George Franklin can truly say that \"the Commission members pay whatever the laws say they are supposed to pay under the circumstances.'' 126"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE: CONCLUSIONS Twenty years after founding of the Trilateral Commission we can now assess its objectives and intentions. Originally pre- sented as a \"study group\" by in terested citizens concerned about world problems, we find th at the Trilateral Commission is anything but this description. The first finding is that from the start the Commission has reflected extremely narrow segmen ts of the citizenry in each constituent country. The Commissi on is as representative of world requirements and world needs as the fox is represen- tative of chickens in the hen coop. The dominant influence has always been David Rockefeller and comparable bankers overseas. The dominant influence is that of the international banke rs, those who already heavily control world directions through control of finance. Further- more, David Rockefeller was long time Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York, the most important regional bank in this private system. The Federal Reserve System is not a public instituti on, it is a private institution, a fact which has to be borne in mind. Federal Reserve distance from the prevailing government of the time is deliberate, so that the financial system can be controlled in the interests of those who own the Federal Reserve. Rockefeller has a small executive Committee that invites 127"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"prominent citizens to join the Commission. This perpetuates the Rockefeller influence so that new members are at least sympathetic to Rockefeller objec tives in their private views. This in itself would not be objectionable if: (1) The Commission was indeed a \"study group\" and, (2) If the Commission exercised the same interest in separation from the Federal Government in appoint- ments as it does in operation of the Federal Reserve. The Trilateral Commission is not a study group. Its studies are farmed out to academics w ho can reflect the Commission views. These studies are then the basis for Trilateral discus- sion and agreed policies beco me the policy viewpoints of individual members. When these members are appointed to the Federal Govern- ment, and generally about one-third of the members at any time are in the current Admini stration, then they transmit these policies into practice. The conclusion is that the Trilateral Commission is a policy-oriented group with the power to translate policies into action whatever the general citizenry may wish. Nowhere do we find any policy de terminations in favor of individual free enterprise a nd individual freedom. We find many claims that the world is \"ungovernable\" and that State action is needed to bring citi zen objectives into line with Trilateral ambitions. Our chapters and examples of attempts to solve social prob- lems through \"wars\" demonstrates policies that must have a hidden objective. The so-called \"war on drugs\" has not suc- ceeded and never could succee d. We find that the Clinton \"war on drugs\" is not far removed from the Reagan-Bush \"war on drugs\" although Clinto n promised a new approach. It is still a multi-billion military approach to intercept supply, a remarkably inefficient procedure. The demand side has never been realistically tackled. And as Lt. Colonel \"Bo\" Gritz has pointed out, along with othe rs, the CIA is deeply involved in trafficking. So we are left with the thought â€” is the war on supply designed to allow other channels like CIA to control supply? This is the only ra tional conclusion one can make. 128"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Whatever the Trilateral Co mmission members may claim, our finding is that the objectiv e is a New World Order with Trilateralists in control.

Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz, U.S.A. (Ret) for U.S. Congress, House Foreign Affairs Committee International Narcotics Control Task Force Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C. Tuesday, 30 June 1987 N INE HUNDRED TONS OF HEROIN & OPIUM WILL ENTER THE FREE WORLD FROM S OUTHEAST A SIA ' S \"G OLDEN T RIANGLE \" THIS YEAR . The reason is because U.S. taxpaye r dollars and American equip- ment have been used to construct a new road that will allow narcotics to pour out of General Khun Sa's Shan Territories rather than trickle out by horse and mule as has been the case until the beginning of this year. Last year 600 tons of Opiates tr afficked from this area. Press reports included as part of this statement argue that it is logistically impossible to increase the output to 900 tons. The new road capable of easily handling 10-ton truck convoys signal not only the capa- bility, but the reality. The disappointing fact is that this new artery was constructed by the Thai Government using money, manpower, time and materials furnished by our drug suppression funds. Moreover, there are serious implica tions that elements within the U.S. Government are Khun Sa's bi ggest customers. The facts are that for 15 years U.S. taxpayers through legislative bodies like this committee and executive agencies such as have testified here today, have dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into drug suppression programs within Thailand and Burma which have done nothing but nourish the flow of narcotics from Asia into the United States. The proof is statistically clear. Fifteen years ago the flow of Opiates was 60 tons; this year it w ill approach or exceed 90 0 tons. The reasons, while multi-faceted, boil down to one word, \"money.\" 157"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Certain high level Thai and Burmese officials are packing their pockets with U.S.-supplied drug s uppression funds, political payoffs, and other spinoff profits like the thousands of Teak trees felled during the Khun Sa road effort. Khun Sa has no outlet for teak, but it is a protected and highly valued commodity in Thailand. More shameful are the serious allegations raised by General Khun Sa and his staff that corrupt U.S. official s allow this travesty and in certain cases are directly involved. After a meeting with General Khun Sa and others, I am convinced that a secret combination exists today within the U.S. Government that was officially germinated during the Nixon-Vietnam years and has, through illicit drug profits, propa gated itself today into a self- serving righteous monster of global proportions. I believe Ed Wilson was a member of this combination and that his activities represent only one of many tentacles. I belie ve the Contra-Iran situation is merely another visible lesion that has emerged from this extra- governmental organism. I say \"would be righteous\" because those within this secret com- bination I believe honestly think they are serving America by offering an established model of sabotage, subversion, and assas- sination to areas threatened by co mmunism. They are in existence because normal government process is too cumbersome, time- consuming and ofttimes impotent. Th ese persons who are intelligent and well seeded in our governmental structure think they are smarter than our elected officials and can expedite accomplishment of national objectives. They have funded their efforts through drug trafficking because of a 1960s mindset that anyone who would use opiates is animalistic and the U.S.A. doesn't really care about them. They began their drug dealing in Southeast Asia as a means to fund the secret war in Laos and Cambodi a that Congress was officially unaware of. Besides my personal experiences, all of these conclusions are spelled out in the book, The Politi cs of Heroin in Southeast Asia. I have good reason to believe that after President Nixon got the U.S. out of Vietnam \"with honor,\" while bringing home \"all the POWs\" in 1973 that either with hi s concurrence, or on the initiative of those \"Best and Brightest\" included within the \"President's 40,\" the war continued to be fought through Project Phoenix.

Even so, an estimated 150,000 nonmilitary persons were terminated; the program failed to meet the expectations of those in charge. Next, I believe the Phoenix model was moved to help stabilize a toppling Shah who happened to be close to the Administration â€” and to people in the secret combination society, many of whom held high positions within the Executive Br anch. The Shah fell. By this time the model was self-perpetuating. Rather than shut down after faili ng in Iran, there was a refocus on the building communist threat in Central America. The Contra-Iran- Oliver North-White House disclosures are only protrusions that have become visible because of the extent and intensity of this para- government organization. Even as these hearings are underway, representatives of this secret combination are at work in the Philippines, offering \"anti-communist solutions\" to that struggling democracy. I believe that. As years and changing administrations have gradually thinned the society's active duty status within the U.S. Government, I believe those who still steer the society have become more self- serving, making huge personal profits under the guise of fighting worldwide communism. Further, I believe they are maximizing their influence to protect those of the brotherhood who still hold active office in the government. I have been told for years that U.S. POWs would never be allowed to return because they were dir ectly related to illegal drug traf- ficking by U.S. officials. Until May of 1987, I thought this absurd. Now, after eight years in the POW-Southeast Asian arena, I clearly can see what was hidden except to those more sensitive to power politics than myself. The reason we have met the enemy and he is U.S. in our efforts to return POWs while they are still alive is simple. When POWs are returned the first demand by the American people will be to examine those within the government responsible for their return. America will want to know why these individuals failed in their official capacities; why the burden fell on the private sector, and what took so long if the POW issue is truly \"Top National Priority\" as designated by President Reagan. Upon investigation it will be revealed that responsible officials were more interested in interested in actuating their secret society than accounting for our POW and MIA. The fact is that all of the Heroin and Opiates could be shut off at 159"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"the Golden Triangle if America's responsible elected and ap- pointed officials would do their job. General Khun Sa is recognized as the drug kingpin and controls the Golden Triangle with a well- disciplined army of 40,000 Shan soldiers. He has stated to me before three other American witn esses on videotape that he great- ly desires to stop the drug trafficking, but we won't let him. He has promised that if we will give hi m any economic alternative, he will not just stem, but stop the flow of narcotics through his areas of control. He has said for example that for one-tenth the money we now give the Burmese for drug suppression turned into economic aid and crop substitution, he will use his force to enforce what we cannot and have not. In addition, Khun Sa has stipulated that the Burmese must be stopped from using the 12 Bell Helicopters and fixed wing aircraft given them by the U.S. to spray the Shan State people, animals, food and water w ith Agent Orange and herbicides. All that I have presented thus far is backed up by written and recorded documents made available to the Committee. It has been reported to me by committee personnel that Khun Sa has made these offers before. They say the CIA has expressed doubt and mistrust that Khun Sa will carry out his part of the bargain. I and three other Americans have met with Khun Sa. We believe him to be sincere. Certainly in view of the dismal failure of the CIA and DEA to slow, stop or even deter the flood of drugs from the Golden Triangle, it seems that a change in dynamics is in order. Especially since Khun Sa has directly implicated persons within the CIA as some of his best customers. The videotapes show testimony of a frustrated medical doctor who, under orders from Khun Sa, did everything from offer radio links to Khun Sa's headquarters to present a horse that might be used to alert DEA of drug movements. The low level agents supported these initi- atives, but in every case they were rejected at DEA headquarter levels. I have strived at the invitation of the Executive Branch for eight years to convince political skeptics that American POWs are alive in the hands of Communist forces in Laos and Vietnam. I abhor drugs and dopes that are users, yet in the past two weeks I've been told by committee staff and others that \"federal sources\" and a Los Angeles State Department employee have said that I am \"a drug trafficker,\" and I will be in pr ison before July 4th. I know this level of federal employee would neve r make such slanderous state- ments unless encouraged by higher-ups. While following the 160"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"classic model of \"deny-defame-divert,\" it is disappointing that law enforcement agencies would reveal such lowlife practices as direct- ly as they have, and then av oid comment when confronted. I have tried in every way to cooperate with the committee and its membership. I've furnished videotapes, only to be informed that the chairman has blocked their distribution. I've supplied the Suchesk letter to Vice President Bush, and requested a written transcript of the file from which Khun Sa's secretary read from. I received a letter in the mail last week. It was from Khun Sa. The stapled and sealed envelope had been opened. Inside, the pamph- let, which had also been stapled shut, had been opened and the con- tents removed. I had asked Khun Sa to translate his record; sign it himself with two additional witnesses. I was assured this docu- ment was part of the opened package. I have requested my con- tacts furnish me with a FAX of th eir copy. It serves to supplement in writing the verbal and video accounts. I'm disillusioned that this comm ittee, which represents the in- terest of 240 million Americans in controlling illegal drug traffick- ing, would take such a negative and skeptical position on such a critical issue as Khun Sa's proposal and my deliverance of the information he gave us. I've been told that I must \"sell my case\" to you. Facts are, I am a citizen who has been twice to see a warlord who is recognized as the world's most powerful Heroin kingpin. This person has shown statistically that our 15-year old drug suppression program is, at best, \"dumb\" by anyone's stan- dards. At best we have millions of U.S. tax dollars being mishan- dled; one recipient has made use of U.S. assets to build a major road, and secures that road from outside infiltration; 900 tons of opiates entering the free world; rampant corruption of allied of- ficials. At worst, in addition to the best case, we have officials within the USG who won't, as Khun Sa says, let him get out of the drug business, because they are his biggest buyers. Your business is representing Americ an interest in drug control. You greatly influence how our ta x dollars are used and how well the enforcement agencies do their job. My business is bringing home POWs while they are still aliv e. Neither one of us has been able to make much headway becau se I'm convinced there are per- sons within the government that are opposing us both. If POWs came home, the resulting investigation will expose their drug involvement; if the drugs are stopped, their source of income dries up.
