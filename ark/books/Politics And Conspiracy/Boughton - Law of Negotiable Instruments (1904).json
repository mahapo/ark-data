Origin of the (6Law 1’I~chant.p9 The idea of negotiability as applied to- modern business affairs is a product of commercial intercourse. Indeed, without this principle, or some equivalent which the wit of man. might have devised, it is safe to say that the world’s commerce and consequently its civilization would have been greatly retarded. An interchange of commodities leads to an interchange of ideas. An interchange of ideas quickens the pulse of civ- ilization and increases the demand for the nece.ssaries and luxuries of life. This in turn quickens commercial activity .and the world’s civilization moves on step by step; The doctrine or idea of negotiability as ,applied to certain legal documents has been and still is one of the salient factors in this movement. It has crossed the frontiers of nations and brought men of different. countries and of different races in- to contact, breaking down the ‘barriers of prejudice and opening channels of trade and trafic. . In the earlier. stages of society when man was yet in a savage, nomadic state and generally at war with all the world beyond his own tribe, commerce was of necessity lim- ited to a narrow sphere and to the exchange, or barter, of the rude articles which savage ingenuity could devise. The advent of agriculture led to the foundation of communities with fixed habitations. Tribal barriers were removed and nations were formed. Manufacturing followed leading to Note.-On account -of the frequency with which army officers are called upon to handle commercial paper, not only on their own account, but for the government as well, it has been thought advisable to present the most necessary features of the law on that subject in the form of a printed lecture which student officers can take with them as a means of ready reference."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2 demands for distant products. The exchange of commo- dities, however, article for article, was difficult and burden- some. This rendered apparent the necessity for some med- ium of exchange, some representative of value, that would pass current in commercial centers. Gold and silver satis- fied this requirement and early became the recognized med- ium of exchange or standards of value. This was a long step in advance but commerce was still barnacled with many difficulties that were overcome only with the slow pro- gress of centuries. Piracy at sea and robbery on land, ra- cial jgealousy, universal warfare, and tedious communica- tions were obstacles not lightly brushed a.side and rendered commercial enterprises dangerous in the extreme. Naturally those engaged in traffic, especially at ‘sea, would seek to secure the acceptance of rules that would af; ford some p,rotection to the undertakings in which they were engaged. These efforts were first manifested in the “Sea Laws” of the Mediterrane.an cities which, lying in the track of oriental trade, constituted during the; middle ages the great commercial centers of the world. One of the features growing out of these crude mari- tim.e regulations was what came to be known as the law- merchant (lex mercatoria), comprising, those usages of trade which merchants regarded as binding in commercial trans- actions. *Blackstone states that’the law-merchant is a branch of the law of ‘nations, and that it has been ingrafted into and made a part of the common law, being allowed, for the Ben+ fit of trade, to be of the utmost validity in all commercial transactions. **And even though they may have been uw * Chase’s Blackstone; 880, He s,ays,’ “In mercantile questions, such as bills of exchange and the lik6: in all marine causes, relating to freight, average, dem,urrage, idsurances, bottomary, atid others of a similar nature; the law-mere chant, which is a branchr of the law of nations, is regularly and constantly adhered to. *+ Id. 41."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3 known to Blackstone usages of trade and commerce are ac- knowledged by courts to be a part of ’ the common law* though of more universal auth0rity.t When the law-m,erchant came to be recognized as a part of the common law is not easy to say, It is referred to in T the Magna Charta and also in the statutes of the Plantage- nets and TudorsQL It was, however, in the time of Black- stone, fully regarded as a part of the common law. , For some time a distinction was maintained between foreign and domestic mercantile contracts, the former being construed according to the “usages of trade”’ or law of merchants, the latter according to the ordinary law of contracts. The. construction applicable to the law-merchant was afterwards extended to local transaction when merchants were parties, those engaged in other avocations or trades being still ex- cluded. Finally, in. 1666, the courts declared, “That the law of merchants is the law of the land, and the custom is good enough generally for any man, without naming him merchant.’ ‘Wt Mention has already been made of, the great advantage to civilization resulting from the adoption of a medium of exchange which made possible the purchase of commodities . without an actual exchange of goods.

Chancellor Kent is of the opinion that the bill of ex- change was known to the ancient Greeks. * But according to Story the medium of exchange employed by the ancients differed in form and purpose from those now in, use .** The nearest app-roach ,was the custom which prevailed at Rome where one paid money to another in that city to be . repaid by the latter at another place. This contract is mentioned by Cicero and a like contract is supposed to be referred to in the Pandects, Other writers assert that there is no vestige of our contract of exchange to be found in the Roman I,aw.*** However this may be, with the downfall of the Western Roman Empire and the advent of the Dark Ages commerce declined and for centuries there was little call for contracts of this character. But with the revival of commerce consequent upon the Crusades and the general awakening at that time they gradually came into use and ” ere long the bill of exchange was a well recognized feature of the commercial world. - According to Hallam? the merchants of Lombardy and the south of France took up the business of remitting-money by bills of exchange and making profits on loans in the early part of the 13th century, an.d within the next two . * 3 Corn.

It is also probable that the chief characteristic of the bill of exchange -negotiability-was a product of this re- vival of trade and comm,erce.t But when once established this principle became a potent factor in the growth of com- merce itself. Being a product of international commerce the attri- butes of the bill of exchange were at first restricted to for- eign bills, that is, to those the parties to which resided in different countries. But the merits being so apparent the inland bill soon *came into use, first upon the continent and afterwards in England. Here, however, they were at first very much restricted, but the restrictions gradually wore away arid now foreign and inland bills, both in England and America, stand very much on the same footing. difference, however, still remains : This To charge the responsi- ble party in case of dishonor protest is required for foreign bills, while for inland bills simple notice either verbal or in writing will be sufficient. In the United States the general rule is that the States ?re “foreign” as far as negotiable in- struments are concerned. THE PROMISSORY NOTE. Instruments in the form of promises to pay must have existed from the earliest times. Credit is essential in all business transactions, but ordinary prudence would require some evidence to show that credit had been given, or that a parol contract existed. This led to the promissory note, an instrument at first unnegotiable, but afterwards (in England) Q Id. There were three species of paper credit in the dealings of the merchants: l-General letters of credit not ad-. dressed to any one and not uncommon in the Levant. Z- Orders to pay money to a particular person. 3-Bills of exchange regularly negotiable.

Bills of exchange and promissory notes are, par excell- ence, negotiable instruments, but as commercial transactions are greatly facilitated by the use of, such instruments the tendency is to extend. the principle of negotiability to other securities or evidences of indebtedness . Thus the check has taken its place among negotiable instruments and is now a marked feature of the commercial world. THE CE@CK. The check is in the nature of a bill of exchange drawn on a bank or banker and payable on demand. It is, however, a distinct commercial instrument though subject to the same rules in regard to transfer, indorsement, and negotiability. The chief points of difference will be referred to later on. . . As a matter of course the law of negotiable instruments has changed and is still changing with the evolution cf com- . , ., merce and of legal science. Each country has a jurispru- de&e peculiar to itself and in the United States this is to a greater or less degree true of the States that comyose the : Union.

It pertains to contracts in general. In this class of transfers the assignee takes what ever is transferred subject to the equities of as- signment. That is, the- assignee takes no better title than that possessed by the assignor, nor is his title complete as against the debtor until the latter has been notified of the transfer. Moreover, except in case of specialties, the con- sideration must be expressed: But negotiable contracts have always been excepted from this rule and pass from hand to hand so as to give the holder who is without notice of prior equities an abso1ut.e title free from the equities of assignment. Nor need the consideration be expressed, ti-,c law implying a consideration sufficient to support the con- tract.“* . This freedom from the restrictions that accompany the assignment of ordinary chases in action is, in fact,, what the term negotiab,ility ** implies, its purpose and office being to facilitate trade by furnishing a kind of money based upon the credit of individuals. In order, however, for a contract to fulfill these condi- tions-that is be negotiable-it must possess the following 1 properties : *** I. It must be in writing and for the payment of a cer- tain sum of money. 2. The sum ordered (bill, check), or promised (note), to be paid must be payable ‘absolutely and unconditionally. 3.

The person in lawful pos- session of a negotiable instrument is called the holder. He may be the payee, indorsee, or bearer. A BIIJ, OF EXCHANGE may be defined as an uncon- ditional, order in writing by one person upon another for the payment of a certain sum of money absolutely’ and at all events. Among -merchants a bill of exchange is usually called a “draft.” When accepted it is called an “accep- tance.” An instrument to be negotiable must be payable absolutely and uncondi- tionally. This requires that there shall be a date, certain to arrive, upon which the instrument willmature or become duo. Therefore a bill of exchange pay- able at or after sight, or.after demand, or after any other wacertain event, must be presented to the drawee for acceptance. That is, it must be presented. to him to determine whether or not he will honor it. If he accepts the date of maturity is fixed. Should acceptance be refused the bill is at once dishon- ored.

PROMISSORY NOTE is an unconditional promise in writing, signed, but not sealed by the maker, to pay a certain sum of money absolutely and at all events, either to the bearer or to a person named therein, or to the latter’s order. Promissory notes, depending upon the way they are written and signed, may be classed as follows : ( I) several, (2) joint, (3) joint and several. The several note has only one maker. A joint note has . two or more persons as makers and is written, “we promise,-” etc. Here the obligation is joint, and if the holder sues he ~ must sue all the makers together. A joint and several note is written, “we jointly and seueraily prwhse,” or “I promise,” and is signed by two or more persons. The holder in this case can sue any one or all the makers as he pleases. In some States statutes make all notes signed by more than one person joint and several. When the payee of a note has indorsed it to a third person the note is virtually converted into a bill. John Doe, the indorser of the note, corresponds to the drawer of the bill; the maker of the note to the acceptor of the bill. The liabilities of these assimilated parties are also identical. The maker of the note and the acceptor of the bill are the parties ‘first liable to the holder. If these parties fail to pay, the in- dorser of the note and the drawer of the bill become liable. A mere memorandum of indebtedness without a promise to pay is not a promissory note. For example, ((I: 0.

The chief points of difference between a bill of exchange and a check are the following:. A check is always drawn on a bank or banker; no days of grace are allowed; the drawek is not discharged by the la&es of the holder on presentment for pavment unless he can show that he has sustained some . inj ury4 by the default ; it is not due until payment is de- manded, and the statute of limitation runs on’ly from that time ; it is not necessary that the drawer of a bill should have funds in the hands of the drawee: a check in such a case would be a fraud.“” Where checks or other negotiable instruments are made payable to a fictitious person they are generally regarded as payable to bearer.? CERTIFIED CHECKS. By certification of a check is meant the act by which the bank admits the check to be good.

The demand may be made whenever it suits the convenience of the party entitled to the stipulated payment. TRANSFER OF NEGOTIABIJ3 INSTRUMENTS : IN- D6RSEMENT.n To constitute a medium of exchange negotiable instru- ments must be readily transferable from one person to an- other. This attribute they have, the transfer being effected by i~dorsewzent if the contract is payable to order, or by simple delivery if payable to bearer. A complete title passes in either case.*** To be able to enforce rights therein the holder of ;d nego- tiable instrument must be a bovta fide holder for value. A thief may, however, transfer for value a negotiable instru- ment that he has stolen and thereby convey a valid title. So also may the finder of a. negotiable instrum.ent that has been lost. By Indorsem.ent is meant the writing of the name of the indorsw on the instrument with the intent either to transfer the tifle to the same, or to strengthen the security of the holder by assuming a contingent liability for its future pay- ment, or both. * In New York, however, it has been held that the certification doesnot extend to the almount named in the check nor to the payee thereof.

It may be payable a given time after date ; at, or a given time after, demand; or at, or a given time after, sight. “Sight” applies only to bills and refers to the time of ‘presentation for acceptance, the ma- turity being determined by the date of acceptance. To charge the drawer and indorsers, presentment for acceptance or for payment, as the case may be, followed in case of refusal by notice of dishonor, is’ necessary. A bill, note, or check is presented by exhibiting it and requesting its acceptance or payment. The holder must first seek pay- ment from the parties primarily liable. That is, <from the acceptor of a bill of exchange, the maker of a promissory note, and the drawen of a check. If they do not pay then the holder must take the necessarylegal steps to ch?,rge the parties secondarily liable; that is, the drawer and indorsers in case of bills and checks, and the indorsers in case of notes. Presentment must be m.ade by the lawful holder or his au- thorized agent. , A failure to present a bill or note for paymeat at the proper time and place- * Norton’s Handbook, 3d Ed., p. 366 et seq."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 ( I) Relieves . the acceptor or maker ‘from payment of further interest and costs of suit (if he were ready to pay at the proper time and place) but not from payment of the principal sum, liability for which continues until paid or outlawed.

Negotiable instruments not payable on demand are en- titled to days of grace,” generally three, which are added to the nominal tim,e of payment. Where no time of payment is specified the instrument is regarded as payable on demand. Checks** are payable on demand. But the drawer of a check is not discharged from his obligation by unreasonable delay in presentment of the check for payment, or in giving him notice of dishonor, unless he has been actually pre- judiced thereby ; but if the drawer has suffered a loss thereby as when the bank fails, he is discharged to the extent of his loss. Checks should be presented for payment within a reason- able time. The following rules are safe: If the holder and banker are in the same place the check should be presented within one business day at’ter its receipt. If they are in different places the check must be for- warded for pres,entment within one business day after its receipt, and must be presented to the banker within. one business day after its arrival at the place where the banker is located. * Days of grace have been abolished pin some of the States. ** In ,some States checks drawn on a banker in another State are regarded as foreign bills 6f exchange and treated ac- cordingly."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I7 DISHONOR OI? NEGOTIABLE INSTRUv..ENTS : NOTICE. or A negotiable instrument is dishonored when acceptance payment, as the case may be, is refused, acceptance or payment being legally required. When an instrum,ent is dishonored notice of that fact must be given- in case of a bill or check, to the drawer and indorsers ; in case of a note? to the indorsers. Otherwise they are discharged. NOTICE OF dishonor, unless a writing is required, may be verbal and should be given immediately after dis- honor, the’ law allowing a r.easonable time, determined by the “usual cot&e of business,” to reach all the parties whom it ii sought to charge. Where the parties all reside in the same place the drawer and indorsers must be notified not later than the next .business day. If they live in dBerent places, notice must be deposited in the post office so as to be taken by the mail leaving within that time.

Generally, the notary takes all the steps, presentment, demand, and givi.ng notice, necessary to fix the liability of the drawer or indors- ers.

But a demand note is negotiable for a reasonable time after its date. PAYMENT BY NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS. Generally a negotiable instrument given for a debt does not discharge it unless by agreement of the parties. But a _ negotiable instrument m.ade by a third person and Given without Endorsement for a contemporaneous debt discharges the debt unless the contrary be expressly proved. If, how- ever, a negotiable instrument made by a third person be in- dorsed for a contemporaneous debt, or given without in- dorsement for a precedent debt, the debt is not discha’rged. But the above rules are presumptions m .erely and may be varied by express agreement between the parties. In some States, however, when a note or bill is given on account of indebtedness payment of the debt is presumed until the con- trary is shown.

The rate of interest payable as damages is also de- termined by this law. The law of the place where suit is brought for breach governs the remedy, form of action, etc. DEFENSES. A party to a negotiable instrument may interpose certain defenses in a suit brought by a holder against him, among which are the following: I. Infancy. In .this. case the contract is voidable, not void. 2, Coverture. At common law a negotiable instrument made by. a married woman was void. This rule has been changed in many States. 3. Statutes. * Statutes may avoid instruments by de- claring certain contracts void, or annexing a pen- alty to the performance of the act for which the instrument is given. 49 Material alterations. It is doubtful whether insanity or complete intoxication is a defense against a holder for value without notice; but ultra z&es is not a defense. Nor is the fact that the instru- ment was obtained through fraud or duress, or that there is a failure of consideration; or that pavment has been made, a .’ defense against a purchaser for value without notice. If alterations are innocently made recovery can be had upon the original consideration. Forgery of a negotiable"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 instrument, or of an. indorsement thereon, except in case of ratification or estoppel, nullifies the instrument as to all parties against. whom the forgery is committed. In case of forgery the payor. can recover of the payee claiming through forgery, the recovery being based upon the warranty. But forgery does not destroy the title of the true owner of the instrument, nor the right to collect it. If the forgery consists in raising the amount, the maker or drawer can. be held only for the original sum, unless through his carelessness he has made the forgery. possible. If he writes with a pencil that can be easily erased, or leaves a blank space whereby the amount can be raised, he can be held responsible for the loss. OTHER INSTRUMENTS POSSESSING ATTRI- BUTES OF NEGOTIABILITY. ’ “A coupovt bo%d is an instrument complete in itself, ,and yet composed of several distinct instruments each of which is in itself as complete as the whole taken together. As originally issued the coupon bond consists. of ( I) an obliga- tion to pay a certain sum of money at a future day ; and (2) annexed to it is a series of coupons, each ‘of which is a prom- ise for the payment of a periodical installment of interest.“* Coupon, bonds containing the usual properties of negotiabil- ity are negotiable and have the qualities of commercial paper. The coupons are written contracts for the payment of a cer- tain sum of money as interest and so drawn that they may be separated from the bond. They are negotiable and suit may be maintained upon them without producing the bond to which they belong.** ,4 certificate of deposit is a written acknowledgment of a bank or banker of the receipt of *a certain sum of money from a certain person upon deposit, and is generally framed in such a form as to constitute a promissory note. * Daniel’s Negotiable Instruments, Sec. 148fP 144 U.
