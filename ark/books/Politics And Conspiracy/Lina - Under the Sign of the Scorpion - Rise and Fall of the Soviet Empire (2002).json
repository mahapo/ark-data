In astrological terms, the sun was just then precisely at the centre of the sign of Scorpio. Thus Scorpio can be regarded as the symbol and guardian of Soviet power. The planet Pluto in turn, affects those under the direct influence of Scorpio. In the past, Mars was said to rule Scorpio but since Pluto's discovery in 1930 and its subsequent integration into the astrological system, it has assumed its rightful place in the sign of Scorpio. The effects of Pluto, even before its discovery, have always been the same, whether or not they were attributed to another planet. The fact that the Soviet empire was born under the \"wrong\" planet demonstrates the inscrutable nature of Pluto, which does not show its true face until the time is ripe to restructure power to its own advantage. It has recently been revealed that the Bolsheviks were well versed in astrology. Scorpio's field of influence incl udes power and financial developments at the expense of others. This is why the power-mongers of Scorpio need to stick together - to establish a political Mafia, in other words. Pluto in Scorpio also involves certain hidden circumstances, which are revealed only with the passing of time. The astrologer E. Troinsky claimed as early as 1956 that the Soviet Empire would break up at the beginning of the 1990s. Due to their vindictiveness, cunning, brutality and art of dissembling, the wards of Scorpio are characterised as extremely dangerous opponents. Those under the power of Scorpio are deeply materialistic extremists who like to exploit others and neither forgive nor forget. If their aims are crossed they become possessed by fury. They stop at nothing to reach these aims. Their true nature remains shrouded in mystery. Scorpio's colour is red and its symbols are the vulture, the snake and the lifeless desert. In the animal kingdom, the scorpion is known as a poisonous creature that prefers the cover of darkness. It has been known to sting others of its kind if they get in its way."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The reader will see that this description suited the Soviet system, its ideology and leaders. The brutality of Soviet power is well documented. Its ideology bore a distinct likeness to the mirage of the desert, since neither of the two have anything at all to do with reality. Despite personal experience of Communism, the average subject of the Soviet Empire knew nothing of the fundamentals or essential points of Marxism-Leninism, or of its true origins and history. Everything of impor- tance or in the least bit compromising has been concealed in both Western and Soviet history books. The former president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, stated that concealment was a kind of falsehood. Therefore, the author would like to reveal a few facts, which corrupt historians usually pass over in silence. This book deals with Adam Weishaupt, who founded the Illuminist- Socialist movement in the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt on the first of May 1776, and Moses Hess, Karl Marx's guide and teacher, two names, which are not generally known to those who have passed through Marxist educational institutions. There is a saying: communism is the bloodiest, most difficult and the most terrible way from capitalism to capitalism. The truth of this now appears to be proved by reality. The representatives of the crim inal powers who halted Russia's development and threw the country into chaos have now themselves admitted that life was better in tsarist Russia than in the Soviet Union. As an example of this, a Soviet Russian head clerk in 1968 lived at a standard, which was only 18 per cent of that which a normal Russian clerk enjoyed in 1914. It has also been calculated that a Russian labourer in 1968 lived at a standard, which was only half of his counterpart's in 1914, even coun- ting an inflation rate of 8 per cent per year. Even so, life in Russia was not so hard in 1968 as in 1991, the last year of Soviet power. Workers during the tsarist regime earned 30 roubles per month, teachers and doctors 200. A loaf of bread (410 g) cost 3 kopecks, 410 g of meat 15 kopecks, 410 g of butter 45 kopecks, 410 g of caviar 3 roubles and 45 kopecks. If we compare the conditions in the USSR with those in the West, we find even sharper contrasts. In 1968, the average standard of living in the United Kingdom was 4.6 times higher than in the Soviet Union. The figures are taken from Anatoli Fedoseyev's book \"About the New Russia\" (London, 1980). 10"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The last dictator of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev (a member of the Trilateral Commission), sought only to mend the roof of his giant empire when its socialist foundations were rotten to the core. In the West and even in the East, the symptoms of the Socialist disease have been discussed but not its ideological, political, or economic causes. For this reason, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the reader about the ideological foundations of Soviet power and about the real reasons behind the decision to spread Socialism-Communism throughout the world using cunning and violence, a decision, which has resulted in the greatest spiritual, social and ecological catastrophe in the history of mankind. Important facts, hitherto unknown, about Soviet Communism, its crimes and its criminals, are continually publicised in present-day Russia. Therefore, intelligent Russians are aware of essentials that are very little known in the West. I have included many such new facts in this second edition of \"Under the Sign of the Scorpion\", and can present an enlarged work to the reader. Juri Lina Stockholm, January 2002. 11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MYTHS CONCERNING FALSE COMMUNISTS AND SHAM CHRISTIANS In the autumn of 1989, the crimes of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu against the Romanian people and the Hungarian minority were discussed on Swedish television. In the studio was Jorn Svensson, a functionary for the Left-Party Communists (VPK), who claimed that the eastern European communists were not true followers of the workers' ideology because they had deviated from the Marxist doctrine. Since then, the crimes of the eastern European communists have come increasingly to the public's attention. Therefore, their sympathisers in the West sought to take a symbolic distance from them, so as not to jeopardise their own chances to missionise in the future. Naturally, they regarded themselves as true communists, despite having previously given their full support to the Bolsheviks in the East. This has become so serious a matter that they now claim these sympathies to have been a grave mistake. Some of the western communist parties began to camouflage themselves to hide their true principles, like the Swedish Left Party Communists, who re- named themselves simply the Left Party. The French communists demanded that their leader, Georges Marchais, step down because he had taken a holiday by the Black Sea as a guest of Ceausescu. Marchais tried to save himself with a cheap trick: he claimed that he had distanced himself from the communist regime in Romania a year earlier, when he said on television that the government of Bucharest had nothing in common with socialism. On the 28th of December 1989, he expressed his hope in the newspaper l'Humanite that true socialism might now begin to be built up in Romania. Presumably, the three hundred million victims of communism are not enough for certain naive people to perceive the evil of the Marxist doctrine. There is not one honest person who would accept a similar view of the evils of the German national socialists, namely the regret that the leaders happened to be criminals who departed from the \"true and benevolent doctrine\", despite the fact that the victims of the Nazi regime 12"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"were far less than the number of those who perished in the countries, which the communists took over. Milovan Djilas, one of the best-known exposers of communism, stated in an interview for the German magazine Der Spiegel (also published in the Swedish daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, 13th April 1983) that he believed the idea of communism had evolved from the culture of the West, from Judaism, from the Utopian philosophy, from Christianity and the medieval sects. We do indeed find some similarities between the communist system and the power structure of the Christian church, especially regarding the ideology and the intolerant attitude. Even a few Christians (not many) have, in retrospect, condemned the Fathers of the Church for their atrocious acts of violence and for laying the foundations of a system of religious totalitarianism in Europe. Certain Christians have called these criminal Fathers of the Church and other barbaric lay members \"sham\" Christians. At the same time they make a point of claiming there is nothing intrinsically wrong about the doctrine; that the fault lies with the sheep, which have strayed from the path of the true doctrine. It is quite improbable that such a doctrine would be without error. The Buddhists have not waged any religious wars or tortured any of their dissidents. Neither have they, like the Christians and the communists, forced their teachings on anyone with violence. The Christians and the communists have both been especially intolerant towards their dissidents. Both Church and Marxism were created with a view to slavery. Both doctrines split into different factions, and both have also claimed a monopoly on the truth. The developments of twentieth century history and science have shown these doctrines to be intrinsically wrong and exploded their dogmas. Sovietologists have revealed embarrassing facts about Marxism, and many Christian ideas have been overthrown by research in quantum physics. (Paul Davies, \"God and the New Physics\", 1983.) Even a cursory glance at the New Testament, which was claimed to be holy, reveals that descriptions are unsupported by any evidence. For instance, the description of Herod the Great is completely erroneous - there is no evidence that he ever ordered any mass slaughter of children. Compared to others, he appears to have been a benevolent king. Historical evidence shows that he, during the great famine in Judea 24 years before 13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the Christian era, bought foodstuffs in Egypt with the government's and his own money, whereupon he organised a fleet to fetch the supplies and distributed them within his kingdom. \"His generosity proved to be spectacular\", according to the historian Michael Grant (\"Herod the Great\", New York, 1967, London, 1971). When the Northern (and poorer) half of Sweden suffered from famine at the end of the nineteenth century, the Bishop of Harnosand refused to distribute supplies among the people lest they got the idea that they were entitled to anything for free; it was better the congregation starved to death. (Dagens Nyheter, 24th December 1989.) Communists are infamous for causing mass famine by confiscating all of the peasants' grain. They nationalised the peasants' land to make them dependent on the state. Both Christians and communists confiscated the lands and possessions of their most dangerous \"enemies\". The Roman emperor Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 B. C.) did the opposite by buying land himself and giving it away to his soldiers to make them independent of the state. In the 1920s, Soviet ideologues held up the \"communist state\" founded by Johannes Bockelson in Munster in 1534 as an example. A group of fanatical Anabaptists led by Johannes Bockelson seized power in Minister, Westphalia on the 23rd of February 1534, where they proclaimed the Miinster commune, also called \"New Jerusalem\". This commune became the abode of extreme ruthlessness. Three days after the seizure of power, the first leader of the commune, Jan Matthijs, expelled all those who were not ready to accept their beliefs. Later, the leadership passed over to the baptised Jew, Johann Leiden, who proclaimed himself king of New Zion (Miinster), and the town council was replaced by a council of twelve apostles. They confiscated the property of the church and the wealth of those who had fled. They banned trade, enforced work duty and abolished money. Everything was to be owned collectively - the people were only allowed to keep their tools - all the produce was confiscated by the commune and polygamy was introduced. This community was intended to become the \"thousand year reign of peace\" (the Millennium). Evil reigned in Miinster for sixteen months before the Bishop's troops arrived on the 25th of June 1535 and executed all the leaders of the commune. Later, the Baptists and the Mennonites arose from the ideology 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of the Anabaptists. The Anabaptists also took part in the peasant uprising and incited the poor to revolt in several cities in Germany and Holland. The Soviet propagandists were particularly impressed by the political terror, which was the basis of the Anabaptist tactics. Both Joseph Stalin and Felix Dzerzhinsky were to have been ordained as priests, and had examples at hand. In the 1930s, Stalin began to officially compare the communist party with the Teutonic Knights of the Sword (Fratres Militiae Christi) from the 13th century. The Taborite religious fanatic, Thomas Muntzer, attempted to seize power in central Germany during 1524-25 with the help of enraged pea- sants. He believed Martin Luther's reforms to be insufficient and wanted to abolish property and overthrow the aristocracy. Descriptions of similar events from an even earlier date can also be found. The Brothers of the Apostles, led by the fanatical Fra Dolcino, seized power in Vercelli, northern Italy, in the early 1300s. Only poverty seemed righteous to them, and so they killed every rich person in the city. The terrorist regime of the Brothers of the Apostles lasted three years, from 1304 to 1307. They did not achieve any form of social equality. The roots of communism can also be found in the book \"The Prince\", written by Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) who was the secretary of the Council of Ten in the republic of Florence. The book presents techniques of cynical manipulation and falsehood to support an unlimited dictator- ship. It was published after his death, in 1532. A Soviet joke goes: \"The Christians only preached the advantages of poverty, the communists enforced them.\" The similarities between the histories of communism and Christianity are sometimes shocking. Bolshevik leaders did not shy away from killing nine innocent people if the tenth victim would be a true opponent. Crusaders occupied the French town Beziers in the year 1208, and their leader, Arnold Amalric, a baptised Jew, gave an order typical of that time: \"Kill everyone - God will recognise his own!\" When the Cheka's (political police's) chief, Felix Dzerzhinsky reported to Lenin in the summer of 1918 that five hundred intellectuals (scientists and cultural figures) had been executed, Lenin became ecstatic. When Pope Gregory XIII learned that 60 000 Huguenots had been murdered as heretics on the 24th-26th of August 1572, he was similarly elated and held a great feast, conducted a church service, and even minted 15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"a new coin to celebrate the massacre. This information comes from Buch- wald's book \"The History of the Church\". In 1198, the church established a commission to persecute and try heretics. This later developed into the Holy Inquisition. In 1483, Tomas Torquemada (1420-1498), a Marrano (baptised Jew), was appointed Grand Inquisitor of Castilia and Aragon. In 1492, he expelled all Jews who refused to become Marranos. Torquemada worked intensively for 18 years and burned people at the stake. He is said to have execut ed many children personally. Symbolic straw dolls were burned in lieu of those who had been charged in absentia. Many people were imprisoned for life, and Torquemada sent thousands to the galleys. The terror of the Church in Spain was, however, substantially less than in the rest of Europe. Professors Henry Kamen (Barcelona) and Stephen Haliczer (Illinois) have made important revisions to the information regarding the extent of the administration of justice by the Inquisition. According to professor Jose Alvarez-Junco at the University of Tuft, the Inquisition only executed, at the most, 5000 Spaniards during 350 years, while at least 150 000 people (\"witches\") were burned at the stake as heretics in the other Christian countries. He concludes that all historians have spread exaggerated information and even myths about the Inquisition. This Grand Inquisitor made torture an efficient tool: certain parts of the body were burned, certain parts had nails hammered through them, certain chosen victims were flayed alive. In order to secure their possessions, he accused other Marranos of faking their allegiance to Christianity. Another Marrano, Isaac Abrabael, controlled Spanish finances at the time. In December 1917, a special commission for dealing with counter- revolutionaries was set up in Petrograd. This organisation was called the Cheka in Soviet Russia, and was especially infamous under its subsequent abbreviations - OGPU, NKVD, and lastly as the KGB. The Inquisition encouraged children to betray their \"heretical\" parents and married couples to hand each other in. Each informer was paid four silver marks. The Soviet officials encouraged a similar type of betrayal. There are still more similarities between institutions of the Bolsheviks, the Roman Catholic Church, and the freemasons. High church figures had commissars bearing letters authorising them to exercise the authority of 16"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"their masters. Similar officials were used in connection with the so-called French revolution and also by the Bolsheviks. The spies used by the church and the Inquisition were called the Militia of Christ; the law-enforcement and reconnaissance organs of the commu- nist dictators were called the People's Militia. The Soviet system had a hierarchy of councils, or Soviets as they were known, of which only the highest, the Supreme Soviet, had the right of pardon - a system reminiscent of the Judaic kahal. Both the communists and the Christians have practised a dreadful bar- barism against opponents. After the crusaders reached the river Carnascio on the 23rd of March 1307, they imprisoned the leader of the Brothers of the Apostle, Fra Dolcino, after first destroying his army of a thousand men. He was horribly tortured and then executed on June 1st, 1307. For an entire day he was paraded through the streets of Vercelli in a wagon, whilst pieces of his body were ripped off with a pair of red-hot tongs. His shoulders apparently shuddered a little when they tore off his nose, but he had kept silent the rest of the time. Lenin and Stalin showed similar sadism when they liquidated their opponents. Both the Christians and the communists have knowingly employed criminals. In 1095, Pope Urban II Clermonti released murderers, thieves and other criminals so that they might take part in the crusade in 1096. On their way through Europe, these villains plundered all they could. (Mikhail Sheinman, \"Paavstlus\" / \"The Papacy\", Tallinn, 1963, p. 32.) The Bolshe- vik leader Leon Trotsky released criminals to terrorise the population. Mao Zedong did the same. The religion of Marxism had roots in Christianity. As Bertrand Russell pointed out: Yahweh = dialectical Marxism. The Messiah = Marx. The Chosen ones = the proletariat. The church = the communist party. The Second Coming of Christ = the revolution. Hell = punishment of the capitalists. The millennium or thousand year reign of peace = communism. 17"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Bolsheviks had their own ten commandments and, like the church, they also mocked their opponents. The totalitarianism of the church belongs to the past but if the church should ever regain its former power, its atrocities would probably be repeated. The Jesuit historian Luigi Ciccutini believed in 1950 that the church had the divine right to judge and intervene in any matter what- soever. He claims that the church was justified in burning Filippo Giordano Bruno at the stake in February 1600. A similar danger awaits us if the communists (with the help of the financial elite) should ever grow strong again. After all their atrocities, we should ignore their pretty slogans. One can characterise both Christianity and communism as extremely anti-cultural ideologies, both of which persecuted leading cultural figures. Both have impeded the free development of science. Due to the reactio- nary attitude of the church, many truths, scientific, religious and esoteric, have still not been accepted. One of the worst crimes of Christianity was the arson ordered by the patriarch Theophilus, which led to the complete destruction of the ancient world's largest library in the Serapis temple of Alexandria in A. D. 391. The root of this crime was the church's hatred and intolerance of know- ledge springing from classical pagan Greco-Roman culture. Another example is the murder of the female philosopher and mathematician Hypatia in Alexandria in A. D. 415. The communists also burned books and persecuted cultural figures. They even prohibited the conductor's profession because \"the orchestras could play perfectly well without conductors\". Later, seeing that their orchestras could not manage without their leaders, the communists had to change their tune. Pope Leo X (1513-1521) believed it right and proper to use the \"wonderful fairy tale about Jesus Christ which has given us so many advantages\", as he stood upon the festive board and raised his glass. (Henry T. Laurency, \"Livskunskap Fyra\", Skovde, 1995, p. 179.) Moses Hess, one of the most important founders of communist ideo- logy, believed communism to be a perfect lie to spread destruction with. (Moses Hess, \"Correspondence\" / \"Briefwechsel\", The Hague, 1959.) It is regrettable that ideologies whose fundamental principle is intole- rance still halt moral development. Two Swedish bishops, Gottfrid Billing 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"in Vasteras, 1888, and Bo Giertz in Gothenburg, 1950, believed that it would be better to crush a child's head with a rock than not to baptise it (Henry T. Laurency, \"Livskunskap Fyra\", Skovde, 1995, p. 185). Even today, Protestant and Catholic Christians continue to brutally terrorise and murder each other in Northern Ireland. Towards the end of their reign, under Mikhail Gorbachev, the commu- nist leaders in Russia were prepared to ask the Russian Eastern Orthodox Church for help in order to preserve their power. However, what is created by violence cannot long survive. Despite the fact that none were allowed to leave the Soviet communist party without retribution, it still collapsed when thousands of people began to leave this criminal institution in 1990. In August 1991, after the Communist party attempted to overthrow Gorbachev's reforms, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin made the communist party illegal, just as the National Socialist (Nazi) Party was outlawed after the Second World War. Life itself forced them to repudiate their primitive and unreal dialectical materialism as an infallible dogma, to part with the \"holy\" book \"Das Kapital\", and the \"prophets\" - Lenin, Mao, and other mass- murderers. These worshippers of violence still have their \"holy shrine\" - Lenin's Mausoleum - but sooner or later they will come to realise that their Messiah, Marx, is as dead as his ism. But the most troubling and challenging question still remains - will we be able to perceive the new incarnations of this evil? 19"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE ILLUMINATI: TRIUMPH OF TREACHERY On the night of Wednesday, the first of May 1776, three men gathered at the house of a young law professor, Adam Weishaupt, in the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt. They had decided to found a secret order to undermine the social system, at first called the Orden der Perfektibilisten (The Order of Perfectibilists). Weishaupt had been working on the plans for this order ever since 1770. Among the three guests were two of Weishaupt's students: Prince Anton von Massenhausen, who had helped work out the rules of the Order, and Franz Xaver Zwack, only registered as a member on the 22nd of February 1778. There was also another man who later went under the pseudonym Tiberius, though nothing more is known about him. The historian Nesta Webster (actually Julian Stern) claimed that the French Count Honore Gabriel Riqueti de Mirabeau, a member of a Dutch Masonic Lodge, was also among the founding members. All the members used pseudonyms in connection with their work. Weishaupt called himself Spartacus, Massenhausen became Ajax and Zwack Cato. The historical Porcius Cato had demanded the total destruction of the city-state of Carthago. Mirabeau was called Arcesilas, but in 1786 his alias became Leonidas (Nesta H. Webster, \"Secret Socie- ties and Subversive Movements\", London, 1924, p. 205). Mirabeau was a famous French orator who had contracted enormous debts. Weishaupt came into contact with Mirabeau through certain Jewish bankers. Mira- beau was blackmailed into joining the Illuminati. (Nikolai Dobrolyubov, \"Secret Societies in the Twentieth Century\", St. Petersburg, 1996, p. 23.) Cities and areas that were important to the Illuminati were given ancient names: Ingolstadt was called Ephesus, Munich Athens, Bavaria Achaia, Vienna Rome, Landshut Delphi, Austria Egypt and so on. With the help of confiscated documents, it can be seen that the Illuminati used the Persian calendar, where October was called Meharmeh, November Abenmeh, December Adarmeh, January Dimeh, etc. 20"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The lawyer Franz X. Zwack received his doctor's degree and became advisor to Count Salm in Landshut where a great deal of the Illuminati's archives was brought. Not long afterwards, in 1779, the Order was renamed Orden der Illuminaten. Their primary watchword was: \"The Illuminati must control the world!\" But first Adam Weishaupt wanted a German unification. In 1779, Spartacus (Weishaupt) had written a letter to Marius (Jakob Anton von Hertel) and Cato (Zwack) and suggested a change of name. They intended to call themselves \"Bienenorden\" (Order of Bees) but they kept in \"Orden der Illuminaten\" in the end. (\"Einigen Originalschriften des Illuminaten-ordens\" / \"Collected Original Writings of the Illuminati ()rder\", Munich, 1787, p. 320.) The Illuminati (\"The Illuminated Ones\") eventually became a powerful und despotic organisation in Bavaria. Its members included Baron von Thomas Bassus, Marquis Constantin Costanzo, Baron Mengenhoffen, Friedrich Munter and other influential people. The Order was founded on approximately the same principles as the Jesuit Order. Adam Weishaupt had work ed five years to develop a system, which suited him. The Order was divided into three classes (the Jesuits had four). The first class was for novices and the lesser illuminated (Minerval), the second for freemasons (including the Scottish Knights), and the third, the mystery class, was comprised of priests, regents, magicians and a king (the Jesuits had a general). Their goal was to impose Novus Ordo Seclorum: the New World Order. The Ideological Background of the Illuminati In 1492, the Alumbrado (The Enlightened) movement was founded by Spanish Marranos (baptised Jews who secretly kept their Talmudic faith) and a similar organisation was founded in France in 1623 - \"Guerients\" who changed their name to Illuminati in 1722. The Spanish authorities attempted to stop the Alumbrado movement as early as 1527 when Ignatius Loyola was temporarily arrested for his activities with the Illu- minati. Loyola (Inigo Lopez de Regalde), who was of Jewish blood, was born in the 1490s. In 1534, he founded his own order - the Jesuits - taking out 21"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"a loan for the purpose. The Pope acknowledged the Jesuit Order on the 5th of April 1540. Benjamin Disraeli, author and prime minister of Great Britain in 1868, and 1874-76, himself a Jew, wrote in his book \"Coningsby\" (London, 1844) that the first Jesuits were Jews. In this new order, all members were under Loyola's surveillance. It was the Jewish Jesuit Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino (1542-1621) who ordered the philosopher Filippo Giordano Bruno burnt at the stake on the 17th of February 1600. In 1771, 23-year-old Weishaupt met Kolmer, a Danish Cabbalist Jew who had just returned from Egypt. Kolmer initiated Weishaupt into the secrets of Osiris magic, the Cabbala and the Alumbrado movement. Nesta Webster assumed that he had been known in Italy as Altotas, Cagliostro's master. Kolmer's occult knowledge made a deep impression on Weishaupt, who later chose the Egyptian pyramid as the Illuminati's symbol of power, probably using an illustration from the book \"Pyramidography\" (1646) by Jean Greaves, professor of astronomy at Oxford. One year earlier (1770), Weishaupt had been given a post as lecturer in canon law at the University of Ingolstadt. He later received his doctor's degree and in 1773, at the age of 25, became a professor at the same university. During a short period he even held the post of principal. In 1800, the university moved to Landshut and from there to Munich in 1826. It was no coincidence that the Order of the Illuminati was founded on the first of May. Among the Cabbalist Jews, this date, 15 (1.5), symbo- lised the sacred number of Yahweh and so became their occult holiday. According to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the first of May - the day following Walpurgis Night - is when the dark mystical forces are celebrated. At this time a young Jew named Mayer Amschel (born February 23rd, 1744) was being tutored to become a rabbi. Amschel lived with his parents in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt am Main. He later took the name Rothschild. It was Mayer Amschel Rothschild who convinced Weishaupt to wholly accept the Frankist Cabbalist doctrine and who afterwards financed the Illuminati. Rothschild had given Weishaupt the task of re- establishing the old Alumbrado movement for the Cabbalist Jews. Theoretical Cabbala embraces only secret teachings about God and nature. But practical Cabbala (such as Frankism) attempts to affect earthly 22"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"matters. It involves the use of amulets and magic numbers as well as the conjuring of evil spirits. Both the Talmud and Midrash contain Cabbalist information. (\"Ancient Oriental and Jewish Secret Doctrines\", Leipzig, 1805.) Jakob Frank (1726-1791) was the most frightening phenomenon in Jewish history, according to the Jewish professor Gershom G. Scholem. His actions were totally immoral. Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman shows in his book \"To Eliminate the Opiate\" (New York, 1974) that there was a clear connection between Frankism and Weishaupt's Illuminism. The goal of the Frankists was to work in secret to establish Jewish world supremacy. Professor Scholem has clearly docum ented that they achieved extensive political power. Jakob Frank (actually Leibowicz) was born in 1726, in Polish Galicia. He officially converted to Catholicism but this was just camouflage. Jakob Frank was jailed in 1760 for continuing to teach the Cabbala (Zohar) and for practising secret Jewish rituals. In 1773, the Russians attacked the region of Poland where Frank was held prisoner. He was released and moved to Offenbach (near Frankfurt am Main) in Germany where he began to lead a luxurious and wild life. His deeds were evil, his personality nefarious. This information comes from Professor Gershom G. Scholem's books \"Cabbala\" (New York and Scarborough, 1974), Sabbatai Zevi\" (New Jersey, 1973) and \"The Messianic Idea in Judaism\" (New York, 1971). Jakob Frank summed up his doctrine in his book \"The Words of the Lord\".He asserted that the creator God was not the same as the one who had revealed himself to the Israelites. He believed God was evil. Frank proclaimed himself as the true Messiah. He vowed not to tell the truth, rejected every moral law, and declared that the only way to a new society was through the total destruction of the present civilisation. Murder, rape, incest and the drinking of blood were perfectly acceptable actions and necessary rituals. Frank was one of those refractory Jews who worshipped devils. The extremist Jews were particularly fond of a devil called Sammael. (C. M. Ekbohrn, \"100 000 frammande ord\" / \"100 000 Foreign Words\", Stockholm, 1936, p. 1173.) Joseph Johann Adam Weishaupt was born on the 6th of February 1748 in Ingolstadt, by the Danube, in Bavaria, into an assimilated Jewish 23"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"family. (Pouget de Saint Andres, \"Les auteurs caches de la revolution francaise\", p. 16.) His father was a professor at the University of Ingolstadt. (\"The Trail of the Serpent\", Hawthorne, 1936, p. 68.) He was educated in a Jesuit monastery and studied law, literature, and atheist philosophy. In 1773, the twenty-five-year-old Weishaupt left the Jesuit Order. This may have been because he had developed his independent ideology, but the subsequent dissolution of the Jesuit Order in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV may also have been a factor. The Jesuit Order in France, Spain, Portugal, Naples and Austria was dissolved. A few years later, Weishaupt's \"Perfektibilist\" Order began to work against the Roman Catholic Church. In 1814, however, the Jesuit Order was re-established and through new infiltrations became more powerful than ever before. In 1775, Professor Weishaupt became a member of the lodge Theodor zum guten Rat within eclectic freemasonry. Later, Weishaupt was to use this foothold in Munich to allow his Illuminati to infiltrate all the other Masonic lodges, due to the fact that he wielded great influence over the lodge through its Grand Master, Professor Franz Benedict (Xaver) von Baader, who had joined the Illuminati. It was Baron Adolf von Knigge (born 16th October 1752 in Breden- beck, died 6th May 1796 in Bremen), Adam Weishaupt's closest collabo- rator, who later helped him to gain entrance to different Masonic organisations. (Pat Brooks, \"The Return of the Puritans\", North Carolina, 1976, pp. 68-69.) In 1777, he received the highest degree of the Knights Templar (Knight of Cyprus) in Hanau. The 27-year-old Knigge joined the Illuminati in Frankfurt in 1780 under the alias of Philo (the original Philo was a Jewish scholar). The Illuminati began to work especially actively after the entrance of Adolf von Knigge in July 1779. Baron von Knigge also wrote the book \"Concerning Association with People\". He brought together many powerful men. It was largely thanks to Philo that the organisation spread through the whole of Germany. Both financial and sexual favours were used to gain control of people in high places. In time, the Illuminati won control of every Masonic order in the world. Important financiers joined the organisation: Speyer, Schuster, Stern and others. The Jews had therefore gained a very powerful position. Their base of operations was Frankfurt am Main. 24"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" In Hamburg, a powerful Jewish-Cabbalist family grew forth. Their name was (Samuel Moses) Warburg and they also joined this conspiracy of world supremacy. 25"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Jesuits had taught Weishaupt much, not least their doubtful morals. He encouraged his closest collaborators to use the lie as a tool and to avoid giving the public any true explanations. The leaders of the Illuminati saw to it that their most dangerous opponents and others who might be a threat to the secrets of the Order were poisoned. (Gerald B. Winrod, \"Adam Weishaupt - a Human Devil\".) Weishaupt got his wife's sister pregnant and, not being able to pay 50 marks for an illegal operation, he unsuccessfully tried to bring about an abortion by the use of drugs. A boy was born on the 30th of January 1784. Later, Weishaupt suddenly became rich... In 1777, the Illuminati began to co-operate with all the Masonic lodges (especially the Grand Orient) in order to infiltrate them. The Duke of Brunswick, Grand Master of Germany, said in 1794 that the Masonic lodges were controlled by the Illuminati. When Weishaupt became a member of the Grand Orient, the lodge was backed financially by Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812), according to the British historian Nesta Webster. Bernard Lazar, a well-known Jewish author, wrote in his \"L'Anti- semitisme\", in 1894, that exclusively Cabbalist Jews surrounded Weis- haupt. Confiscated documents show that of 39 Illuminati holding lesser leading positions, 17 were Jews (i.e., 40%). The higher one looked in ranks, the larger was the percentage of Jews. Even the fact that the Illuminati headquarters in Ingolstadt were later converted into a synagogue was symbolic of this conspiracy. Lazar stated that all these Jews became the agents of revolution because they had \"revolutionary souls\". There were four especially important Jews in the Illuminati leadership: Hartwig (Naphtali Herz) Wessely, Moses Mendelssohn, the banker Daniel von Itzig (1723-1799) and the businessman David Friedlander. (La Vieille France, 31st of March, 1921.) All of the initiated had taken a vow \"to eternal silence and undeviating loyalty and total submission to the Order \". Each member had to promise: \"I pledge to count what is best for the Order as my own best, I am ready to serve it with my personal fortune, my honour and my blood... the friends and enemies of the Order shall also become my friends and enemies...\" Lastly, each new member was warned: \"If you are a traitor and a perjurer, then know that the brothers shall take up arms against you. Do not hope to flee or to find a place to hide. Wherever you are, shame, 26"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"contempt and the wrath of the brothers shall pursue and torment you to your innermost entrails.\" Most members were led to believe that the lower degrees of mystery they had reached were the highest. Few members had been informed about the true purpose of the Order. The Illuminati's codex was presented in Masonic terms and prescribed lies, treachery, violence, torture and murder in order to reach all its goals. Many members believed themselves to be working for an improvement of the world. They never guessed that Weishaupt's true purpose was to establish Novus Ordo Seclorum, a global program for world domination. The Protestant princes and rulers in Germany were well disposed to Weishaupt's official plan to destroy the Catholic Church and they sought membership in his Order. Through these men Weishaupt gained control over the Masonic Orders, into which he and his other Jewish cronies were initiated in 1777. To prevent the rulers from understanding the true aims of the Illuminati, he forestalled their contact with the higher degrees. During the year following its founding, the Order was spread exclusively through southern Bavaria. Later, it gained a foothold also in Frankfurt am Main, Eichstadt and other cities, according to \"Vagledning for frimurare\" / \"Guidance for Freemasons\", Stockholm, 1906, p. 166. Officially, the Illuminati were supposed to spread virtue and wisdom, which was to subdue evil and stupidity. They wanted to make great discoveries in all branches of science. The Illuminati were to be cultivated into noble, eminent people, also according to \"Guidance for Freemasons\". In time, the following men joined the Illuminati: the bookseller and writer Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733-1811), whose alias became I.ucian, Duke Ernst von Gotha, Heinrich Pestalozzi, whose pedagogic system Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, began applying in Soviet Russia, Duke Karl August, Baron Herbert von Dalberg, Count Stolberg, Baron Tomas Franz Maria von Bassus (whose alias became Hannibal on the 13th December 1778), the author, folklorist and philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), the Jewish author and prominent freemason Johann Christoph Bode (1730-1793), whose pseudonym was Amelius, Ferdinand of Brunswick, Professor Semmer from Ingolstadt, the philo- sopher Franz Baader from Munich and others. Adam Weishaupt began to work especially closely with the Jewish Masonic leader Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786). Mendelssohn became,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"so to speak, Weishaupt's invisible guide. Moses Mendelssohn was officially known by the Jews as a poor writer who became one of Germany's fore-most philosophers during the \"age of enlightenment\". He called himself a philosopher and a cultural personality. Officially, Mendelssohn's aim was to \"modernise\" Judaism so that the public might accept the Jews when they ostensibly gave up Talmudism and \"assimi- lated\" to the western culture. The Illuminatus Mirabeau wrote a book in 1787 about Moses Mendelssohn's political \"reforms\", to spread even more fantastical myths about him. In secret, however, Mendelssohn encouraged the Jews to faithfully keep to the beliefs of their fathers. He led the Illuminati in Berlin. The First Disclosures From 1781 on, the resistance to Adam Weishaupt's movement started to grow. The first official attack on the Illuminati was made in 1783, 215 years ago. A rejected candidate, the bookseller Johann Baptist Strobl from Munich, was the first to raise the alarm. Weishaupt immediately declared that the man was an uninformed slanderer, rough in manners and speech. But others came after Strobl: Professor Westenrieder and Danzer also warned about the Illuminati's true activity, according to \"Vagledning for frimurare\" / \"Guidance for Freemasons\", Stockholm, 1906, p. 166. The Duchess Maria Anna and professor Joseph Utzschneider at the Military Academy in Munich (who had left the Illuminati in 1783) also came out with public warnings. In 1784 the Order already had 3000 members spread over France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Hungary and Italy. Even- tually, several members left: Zaupser and professors Grunberg, Renner and Cosandey from Munich. On the 1st July 1784, even von Knigge gave up all his responsibilities within the Order due to a conflict with Weis- haupt. The latter, though he totally accepted Philo's (von Knigge's) new, polished plan of reforms, still wanted to make additions and changes here and there. Philo was later to return. Strobl's company began publishing seve ral polemical pieces aimed at the Illuminati. It is sufficient to mention: \"Babo, Gemalde aus dem menschlichen Leben\" (\"Babo, Impressions from Human Life\"). These 28"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"publications worked with planned effect. When a more conservative and patriotic regent, Duke Charles Philipp Theodore (1724-1799), reached power in Bavaria, he issued a ban on secret societies on 22 June 1784. The Illuminati and the freemasons closed their lodges. The freemasons sought to defend themselves publicly. The Illuminati even offered to present all their papers and allow themselves to be subjec- ted to public trial but nothing helped. On the 11 February 1785, Weishaupt was discharged and forbidden to live in Ingolstadt and Munich. At the same time, the university was informed that Weishaupt would be arrested. On 16 February, he went underground and was hidden by his Illuminati brother Joseph Martin, who worked as a locksmith. A few days later he fled from Ingolstadt to Nuremberg dressed in the working clothes of a craftsman. He stayed in Nuremberg a short while and then travelled on to the free city of Regensburg where he continued his activities, but then a stroke of fate occurred that put the police on the Illuminati's tracks. (Countess Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 291.) During the inquiry, more and more terrible evidence against the Illumi- nati appeared, but they continued their activities despite the ban. Therefore, on March 2nd 1785, a further decree was issued which made possible the confiscation of the Illuminati's assets. On 20 July 1785, the courier of the Illuminati Jakob Lanz (who worked as a priest) was hit by lightning in Regensburg and died. Weishaupt was together with him. Lanz intended to travel on to Berlin and Silesia and received his last instructions from Weishaupt before he died. He had sewn in a list of Illuminati and some compromising papers in his priest's robe. Weishaupt did not know about this and became the victim of his own conspiracy. (Countess Sofia Toll, \"The Brothers of the Night\", Moscow, 2000, p. 291.) The local police found other important documents at Lanz' house, in- cluding detailed instructions for the planned French revolution. Some of the papers were addressed to the Grand Master of the lodge Grand Orient in Paris. Everything was handed over to the Bavarian government and on the 4th August 1785 a new ban on secret societies was issued. On 31 August, an order to arrest Weishaupt was issued. A price was put on Adam Weishaupt's head in Bavaria. Weishaupt fled to Gotha, where the llluminatus, Ernst, Grand Duke of Saxe-Gotha, could protect him. 29"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"He gave Weishaupt the title of Privy Councillor, gave him sanctuary. Weishaupt stayed in Gotha for the rest of his life. He died on the 18th November 1830. A bust of him stands on display in the Germanisches Museum in Nuremberg. The police began to look for known members of the Order. The Illuminati had managed to infiltrate many important posts in society. For this reason the police investigation was very slow. The raid on Zwack's house, which had a direct link to the secret Illuminati documents found at Lanz' house, was only made one year and two months after Lanz was struck by lightning, on 11 and 12 October 1786. On the llth-12th October 1786, they searched the house of Dr Franz Xaver Zwack (Cato) in Landshut where the Illuminati kept their most important papers. In the following year Baron Bassus' (Hannibal's) castle in Sandersdorf was also searched and the police confiscated even more papers concerning the Illuminati's conspiracy against the whole world. In these documents, which I carefully studied in the summer of 1986 in the Ingolstadt archives, plans for a global revolution were laid out and these papers clearly stated that this destructive operation was to be the work of secret societies. 30 "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Several important men in Ingolstadt and Bavaria lost their posts, some were even imprisoned or expelled from the country - but some of those involved were so powerful that they were spared retribution. The free- masons did not believe they were given a fair trial, as no defence was permitted. In the autumn of 1786, the Elector Karl Theodor demanded that the Illuminati cease their activities. They did not. In 1786, two remarkable books about the Illuminati were published: \"Drei merkwurdige Aussagen\" (in which Professors Griinberg, Cosandey und Renner testified) and \"Grosse Absichten des Ordens der Illuminaten\" (\"Great Purposes of the Order of the Illuminati\") with Professor Joseph Utzschneider's testimony. After a lengthy inquiry, the Elector ordered two works containing confiscated secret documents to be printed under the titles: \"Einige Originalschriften des Illuminaten-Ordens\" and \"Nachtrag von weitern Originalschriften\" (\"Some Original Documents of the Illuminati Order\" and \"Supplement of Further Original Documents\"). These books were sent to the governments in Paris, London and St. Petersburg, but were not taken seriously (until it was too late). Johann Baptist Strobl also printed a new collection of documents concerning the Illuminati in 1787. According to \"Guidance for Freemasons\", Weishaupt, von Knigge, Bode and the other \"most distinguished Illuminati\" were noble-minded, honest and well-intentioned men who aspired towards goodness and justice. Some truly lofty cultural personalities allowed themselves to be fooled by the skilful Illuminati pr opaganda. Adam Weishaupt, as a skilled propagandist, had previously written the books \"An Apology for the Illuminati\" (1786), \"Das Verbesserte System der Illuminaten\" / \"The Improved System of the Illuminati\" (1788), \"Spartacus und Philo\", (1794), and others. When the Illuminati were banned on 4 August 1785, Zwack fled to Augsburg and from there to Weslar. After the death of the Elector, Zwack returned to Bavaria, where he was reinstated as a civil servant. Von Knigge travelled to Bremen, where he died as a British officer on 6 May 1796. Several other members were dismissed from their posts. All according to the Grand Master of the Illuminati, Leopold Engel. Even the great poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe became a freemason in 1780 and joined the Illuminati somewhat later in the 1780s. His alias within the Order was Abaris. (\"Geschichte des Illuminaten-Ordens\" / 31"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"\"History of the Order of the Illuminati\" by Leopold Engel, Berlin, 1906, pp. 355-356). But eventually he was able to see through their deception. The Illuminatus Goethe wrote to Bode, a fellow member, on the 22nd June 1784: \"Believe me, our moral world is undermined by sub-terranean tunnels, basements and sewers, like a large town usually is, without anyone usually thinking of their connections. It is comprehensible to me or any other enlightened person if smoke sometimes rises from a crack or if strange voices are heard...\" The Murders of Schiller and Mozart The great poet and playwright Friedrich von Schiller moved to Mannheim on the 27th July 1783. In June 1784 Christian Gottfried Korner (1756- 1831), an important Illuminatus, sent Schiller a letter suggesting he join the Illuminati. Korner saw to it that all Schiller's debts were paid off and following this, he joined the Order. An Illuminatus was bound by the codex of the Order: \"I shall perform an action, if asked by the Order, which I may not consent to, inasmuch as it (when seen as a whole) would truly be wrong. Furthermore, even if it might seem so from a certain point of view, it would cease to be improper and wrong if it served as a means to ther eby achieve blessedness or the final aim of the whole.\" This quote comes from the documents of the Order which were taken during the police search of Baron Bassus' castle in Sandersdorf and later published under the collective title \"Nachtrag von weitern Originalschriften\" in Munich, 1787. Two defectors from the Order - Professors Cosandey and Renner - also confirmed in April 1785 that an Illuministic principle was \"the ends justify the means\". It was only later that Schiller was able to see through the deception. Deception and blackmail were the order's ways to reach its aims. Weis- haupt had advised his closest Illuminati brothers: \"Devote yourselves to the art of deception, the art of disguising yourselves, of masking your- selves, spying on others and perceiving their innermost thoughts.\" To make sure that the secrets of the Order were not leaked, Weishaupt created a secret police corps within the Order which he called the \"insinuating brothers\". These worked in the same manner as the Bolshevik's Cheka and its successors: denunciation, provocation, blackmail and terrorism. The 32"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"insinuating brothers\" acted with full force during the reign of terror which is called the \"Great French Revolution\", which was largely the work of Illuminati agents. Following the French Revolution, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe declared his detestation of it to Eckermann. He said that all sudden changes brought about by violence were repugnant to him because they went against the order of nature (\"Goethe\" by Karl Vietor, Stockholm, 1953, p. 100). Naturally, Friedrich von Schiller could not suspect that Heinrich Voss, a young doctor who took care of him, was one of the \"insinuating brothers\" who reported everything he heard and saw to Weishaupt. Schiller, Pestalozzi and several other Illuminati from Germany were given French citizenship as \"prominent foreigners\" in 1792. Schiller read about this in the newspaper Moniteur. After seeing through the Illuminati's evil nature, Schiller planned to write a play called \"Demetrius\", the working title of which became \"The Bloodbath in Moscow\". This play was to uncover some of the atrocities behind the scenes of those in power. Heinrich Voss reported this to Weishaupt who wished to stop this play at any cost. Fortunately for the Illuminati, Schiller died after a long illness at around six o'clock on the 9th of May 1805. Hermann Ahlwardt claims in his book \"Mehr Licht\" / \"More Light\" (1925, pp. 60-69) that Schiller was murdered by the Illuminati. A collective of German and foreign experts (including Sten Forshufvud from Gothenburg and Professor Hamilton Smith from Glasgow) found airsenic in samples of Schiller's hair. The 45-year-old Schiller's work was never completed; instead he ended up in a mass grave. (Henning Fikentscher, \"The Latest Developments in Research of Schiller's Mortal Remains\".) On 5 December 1784, the freemasons asked the brilliant Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to become a freemason. He joined the lodge Zur Wohltatigkeit (To Charity) on 14 December 1784. He was also a member of another lodge, Zur wahren Eintracht (To True Concord). This was a double lodge. Soon Mozart reached the very highest degree, the 33rd. Mozart wrote many compositions for Masonic ceremonies. The most important freemasons in Vienna were Illuminati at the same time. In 1783, 36 of the 83 brothers in Zur wahren Eintracht were Illuminati. There were also many conspirators among the members of To 33"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Charity. Mozart's powerful friend, Baron Gottfried van Swieten was an Illuminatus. Also his closest friend Count August von Hatzfeld was an Illuminatus. In his obituary notice for Hatzfeld in 1787, the local leader of the llluminati, Christian Gottlob Neefe, praised him in Magazin der Musik. Neefe was Beethoven's teacher. It was for this reason that Beet- hoven became a freemason and gained close ties to many llluminati, including Gemmingen, who had helped Mozart in Mannheim and recruited him as a member of To Charity. Mozart was impressed by the official intentions of the llluminati. He did not know any more details. He had no idea what his influential friends really intended. There is no clear information about whether Mozart even knew that his friends were members of the subversive llluminati. They only revealed their membership to those whom they might be able to recruit. Adam Weishaupt had taught: \"To some of these freemasons we shall not even reveal that we have anything more than what the freemasons have... All those who are not suitable for the work shall remain in the Masonic lodge and advance there without knowing anything about the additional system.\" (\"Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens\", Munich, 1787, p. 300.) In December 1785, the llluminati's activities in Vienna were prohibited. The llluminati were forced to leave their lodges. Despite the ban, they continued to act as ordinary freemasons. They went over to The Crowned Hope. The llluminati Ignaz von Born, Joseph von Sonnefells and Otto von Gemmingen founded a new lodge, The Truth, the Grand Master of which was Born. The llluminati believe that they preach the ultimate truth. On 14 January 1786, Mozart joined the new lodge The Crowned Hope. But he was not present at the opening ceremony and later he seldom attended their meetings. During this period, Mozart seldom wrote Masonic music. Mozart belonged to the society where the llluminati still dominated. Only during the last year of his life, 1791, did he produce new pieces of music for the freemasons. This music contained secret codes and moods. Mozart desired true friends. This was why he became a freemason. All his friends were freemasons. As a very sociable person, Mozart could not be alone and therefore needed friends to associate with. It has been observed that Mozart, due to his membership in Masonic lodges, found it easier to succeed and to make a name for himself in 34"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Europe, since high-ranking Masonic brothers supported him. Nearly half of the members of To True Harmony were aristocrats who helped Mozart, for example Esterhazy. Mozart's publishers were also freemasons: Pasquale Artaria, Cristophe Torricella and Franz Anton Hoffmeister. Mozart could always count on the brotherly hospitality of the freemasons, and during his sojourns abroad, he always received economic support and free lodgings. During his travels 1787-1791, the freemasons in Prague and other places helped Mozart in various ways. There is written evidence which proves this. Friends among the freemasons played a crucial role in aiding Mozart financially: Lichnowsky, Franz Hofdemel and Michael Puchberg were among his most important creditors. Mozart, in his turn, helped other freemasons by acquiring loans for them. In December 1787, Mozart was appointed the imperial chamber composer. This gave him requisitions for greater operas. The Illuminati had become a state within the state. Despite all the prohibitions, they continued with their subversive activi ties against society. At that time, people lacked experience and resources to protect themselves against freemasonry, which was under the influence of the Illuminati. The prominent Austrian composer Franz Schubert was not a freemason and he died poor and unappreciated. As a gifted man, Mozart finally managed to see through the Illuminati's evil, despite the fact that it appeared to be an angel of light. He intended to protect society by founding a secret society with several of his friends, Die Grotte (\"The Cave\"). Mozart was well aware of the deadly risk he was taking. Already in April 1787, he wrote in a letter to his father that death was actually the friend of man and that he could never lie down to sleep without thinking that he, despite his youth, might not see another day. (Maynard Solomon, \"Mozart\", Stockholm, 1995.) He wished to expose the magic and the conspiracy of the freemasons to the public. For this purpose he intended to use his opera \"Die Zauberflote\" (\"The Magic Flute\"), where Sarastro's prototype was the Grand Master of the freemasons, Ignaz von Born. Mozart had a perfect memory. Once he had heard a melody, he could play it again later without making any mistakes. \"The Magic Flute\" (1791) contained many revelations about the secrets of freemasonry. He used the pyramid of the Illuminati, the all- seeing eye, the temple and other secret symbols. These metaphors were later removed. Mozart also used musical means of expression by 35"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"contrasting lyrical and tragic themes, elegance and folklore, fantastic details and the solid atmosphere of the orchestra. The opera premiered in the autumn of 1791. The Illuminati could not forgive Mozart for this. \"Requiem\" was requisitioned from him anonymously in order to celebrate his own death. He was also paid in advance. The freemasons poisoned the object of their hatred slowly. \"Requiem\" was finished up to the second-to-last row of verse: lacrymosa dies ilia. Sussmayr finished the opus. Hermann Ahlwardt claimed in his book \"Mehr Licht!\" (\"More Light\") that Mozart was murdered. He died on 5 December 1791, precisely seven years after his initiation into the Masonic lodge. Salieri was later made the scapegoat. Hermann Wagener's \"Staats- und Gesellschaftslexikon\" (volume 18, 1865) confirmed that Mozart was poisoned. In 1990, several doctors tried to claim that Mozart died of a kidney disease. (Dagens Nyheter, 19 September 1990.) But if he had died a natural death, the freemasons would not have taken away Mozart's body to prevent an autopsy after he died, or laid him in a grave for the poor together with quicklime. If Mozart had been faithful to the freemasons, he would have been buried with great honours. His hypocritical \"Masonic friends\" wept crocodile tears. If \"The Magic Flute\" had been accepted, those in power would not have sent Johann Emanuel Schikaneder, author of the opera's libretto, to a lunatic asylum, where he died in 1812. In Austria, freemasonry was forbidden in the middle of the 1790s. Society managed to keep its ban on this subversive movement until 1918, when the freemasons in Austria came to power with the aid of the false socialist doctrine. The freemasons continue to smear and depreciate Mozart today (for example Milos Forman in his film \"Amadeus\"). The Illuminati as Infiltrators The Illuminati moved freely within the many secret societies of the time seeking to utilise the liberal ideology of freemasonry as a bait for those who lacked knowledge of its true purposes. \"All Illuminati are freemasons but far from all freemasons are Illuminati,\" stated Professors Cosandey and Renner from Munich in their testimonies in April 1785. 36"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Only a minority was allowed to reach the highest mystery degrees. Only those few knew of the true intentions of the order. Cosandey and Renner, together with several other witnesses, claimed that \"there was constant talk of the purpose\" without any explanation of what this was. Those of the lower degrees (\"useful idiots\") were only to obey, without under- standing why. Weishaupt's plan for seizing power was ingeniously simple. The moul- ders of public opinion (priests, writers, public officials) were to be made obedient tools, whereupon they would, in Weishaupt's words \"surround the princes\". As \"advisors\" they were to influence political decisions in favour of the Illuminati's aims. When entering the Order, the new brothers had vowed: \"I shall never use my position or post against another brother.\" This corrupt group loyalty did not relate to the brothers as individuals, however; they were only tools for the invisible powers within the Order. It could just as easily be turned against any particular brother if the \"purpose\" (i.e., Weishaupt himself) decreed it. So the brothers of the lower degrees were made to provide information (on printed forms) each month on their own actions and those of fellow brothers (the so-called Quibus licet). The leaders of the Order compiled information from these \"con- fessions\" which they could use later against any refractory brothers. Weis- haupt also encouraged the Illuminati to steal or copy secret and government documents. The Order needed these documents for its revolutionary activities but it also wanted the brothers to lose any feelings of loyalty for the established order by having them constantly seeking to betray it. Religion, nationalism, patriotism, loyalty to the ruler, family ties - all such feelings were to be replaced by a single strong loyalty to the Illuminati's cause. A defector, Joseph Utzschneider, a professor at the Military Academy in Munich, revealed that the constant preaching against the fatherland disgusted him so much that he left the Order. The supranational socialist power the Illuminati aspired to was summed up in the concept of Novus Ordo Seclorum (The New World Order). Some of the main points of this program were: 1. Suppression of all religion, including all communions and doctrines which could not be subjected as tools for Illuminism. 2. Suppression of all feelings of nationality and - in the long term - abolition of all nations and introduction of an Illuministic world-state. 37"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"3. Successive transference of all private and national property into the hands of the Illuminati. The methods whereby to accomplish this were new taxation laws which Illuministic officials were to introduce. Weishaupt's original plans also in- cluded a progressive income tax (so this is no new invention!) and an even more confiscatory inheritance tax. Karl Marx, too, wanted a high, progressive income tax in his \"Commu- nist Manifesto\". The intention was to weaken society. 4. An all-encompassing espionage and denunciation system with the \"in- sinuating brothers\" as prototype. The symbol of this was the all-seeing eye, an eye within a pyramid, which was the Illuminati's symbol of power. And finally: 5. A global moral rule, a complete standardisation of all people's inner- most will, wishes and aspirations beneath \"the one will\"; the will of the Illuminati. The Illuminati simply wanted to abolish all forms of ordered govern- ment, patriotism, religion and the family to finally set up a world govern- ment. Upright people would never work for such an abhorrent program, so the \"normal\" Illuminati were filled with fair phrases about love, charity and suchlike which we call \"ideology\" today. The further up one advanced, the more primitive were t he members. The more primitive the individuals, the lower the ideals enthusing them. Therefore, the Illuminati have used all sorts of ideologies (Nihilism, Liberalism, Fascism) or made them up themselves (Marxism, Commu- nism, Socialism) whereas they them selves were perfectly independent of all ideology. In 1933 The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia published a large amount of information about Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati, but after this year the entries were blatantly inconsequential. A conference was held at Mayer Amschel Rothschild's castle in Wilhelmsbad on the 16th July 1782, where the freemasons and Illuminati forged a complete alliance. In this way, the leading secret societies began a closer co-operation with the Illuminati. Thereby, Weishaupt gained no less than three million tools to work with. In time, the Illuminati were to bring death and suffering to hundreds of millions of people. At the Masonic conference in Wilhelmsbad, a decision to murder Louis XVI of France and Gustavus III of Sweden was made. (Charles de 38"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Hericault, \"La Revolution\", p. 104.) The initiative for this conference was Jewish. (A. Cowan, \"The X Rays in Freemasonry\", London, 1901, p. 122.) A decision to murder emperor Leopold of Austria was also made at the conference. He was poisoned on the 1st March 1792 by the Jewish freemason Martinowitz. Gustavus III of Sweden was murdered the same month. The freemasons had gathered in Lyon in 1778 to discuss the coming revolution. Further congresses were held in Paris in 1785 and 1787 and in Frankfurt am Main (where Rothschild had his bank) in 1786. The Illuminati sought control over the press and began placing their infiltrators behind the scenes as \"experts\". The Order also wanted to influence schools. In 1800, the Illuminati were active in Sweden, Austria, Russia and many other countries. Three years earlier, Professor John Robison had written a thorough exposure of the Illuministic plot in his book \"Proofs of a Conspiracy\" (London, 1797). The English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was initially also fooled by the Illuminati's propaganda, despite Weishaupt having stated fairly distinctly that the purpose of the Illuminati was to act tirelessly until \"leaders and nations disappear without violence from the Earth, humanity becomes one great family and the world a residence for sensible people\". But later Shelley came across a copy of Abbe Barruels' sensational book \"Memoirs, Illustrating of History of Jacobinism\", which had been published in 1798. This book revealed, with the help of certain Bavarian documents, the Illuministic Jews' conspiracy. Shelley took these revelations seriously and recommended the book to his friends. He began to regard the Illuminati as evil incarnate and even suggested to Leigh Hunt, the outspoken author that they found a society where the sensible members would stand against \"the society of freedom's enemies\". Shelley afterwards continued to see through the machinations of the Illuminati behind the political scenes. The Americans Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton became acquainted with Weishaupt's doctrine in the 1790s. Jefferson and Hamil- ton opened the Masonic lodges in the United States of America to European Illuminati, despite many voices being raised in warning against this action. Among these protestants was John Quincy Adams, who was later elected president (1825). He wrote a letter to Colonel William L. 39"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Stone revealing how Jefferson exploited the Masonic Order to undermine society. The Illuminati retaliated by making Adams' attempted re-election im- possible. Adams was subjected to a vicious smear campaign by the national press, which had already come under the control of the Illuminati. Adams also tried to publish a revealing book about the Illuminati but the manuscript was stolen. Captain William Morgan, who had reached a high degree within freemasonry and had a central position in the order, found some of the terrible secrets of the Illuminati in his Batavia Lodge No. 433 in Batavia, New York. He became aware of the Illuminati's goals and travelled around the USA to warn the Masonic lodges. In 1826, he explained that it was his duty to warn the public about the secret plans of the Illuminati. Morgan wanted to expose the shady activities of the Masonic elite in a book. He signed a contract with the publisher, Colonel David C. Miller. The book, \"Freemasonry Exposed\", was published in 1826. This brought the members of the concerned lodges to the verge of nervous collapse. At that time there were 50 000 freemasons in the USA. After the publication of this book, 45 000 freemasons left their lodges. Nearly 2000 lodges were closed. Many of the remaining lodges cancelled their activities. In the state of New York alone, there were 30 000 freemasons. After Morgan's book was published, the number of members decreased to 300. (William J. Whalen, \"Christianity and American Freemasonry\", 1987, p. 9.) Richard Howard, an English Illuminatus, was sent to America to murder Morgan. Together with four others he kidnapped Morgan and drowned him in a lake, the intention being to scare other freemasons into sub- mission. (Michael di Gargano, \"Irish and English Freemasons and their Foreign Brothers\", London, 1878, s. 73.) The American historian Emanuel M. Josephson revealed in his book \"Roosevelt's Communist Manifesto\" (New York, 1955, p. 24) that the Illuminati's Columbia Lodge was founded in New York in 1785. Its first leader was Governor DeWitt Clinton, followed by Clinton Roosevelt. In 1786 the Illuminati lodge in Virginia was founded and Thomas Jefferson became its leader. When Weishaupt was exposed in Bavaria, Jefferson defended him as an \"enthusiastic philanthropist\". Within a short time the Illuminati had opened fifteen lodges in America. 40"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Thomas Jefferson did all he could to finally get the Illuminati's pyramid accepted by Congress as the national (great) seal on the 15th September 1789. In 1789, the publicist, statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706- 1790), himself a freemason, demanded that the United States of America defend itself against the Jewish immigration and influence with the help of the constitution, since the Jews had become a state within the state. This demand was refused and instead the Star of David became the symbol of the military and police in America. George Washington, who had become a freemason in 1752 when he was 20 years old, also attempted to oppose the Illuminati's work in America after he was convinced in 1796 that they posed a threat to the nation. Due to this, Weishaupt had made plans to murder Washington if he became too troublesome. (Neal Wilgus, \"The Illuminoids\", New York, 1978, p. 33.) David Pappen, President of Harvard University, also came out with a warning against the Illuminati on the 19th of July 1798, and somewhat later Timothy Dwight, President of Yale University, followed suit. This led Henry Dana Ward, Thurlow Weed and William H. Seward to form an anti-Masonic party in the United States of America in 1829. The Party took part in the presidential elections in 1832 but 1840 had already outmanoeuvred it... Weishaupt, like Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) in the Republic of Florence, believed that power should be held exclusively by certain chosen people - all the others were unreliable nobodies. In his post- humously published book \"The Prince\" (1532), Machiavelli advocated the introduction of an unlimited dictatorship. The Jesuits' Totalitarianism as a Prototype Some sources, above all Christian, claim that Weishaupt's ideological prototype was Plato's \"Republic\". These claims are misleading. Weis- haupt (despite his hatred of them) admired the Jesuits' tactics, discipline and skill at organisation, their ability to put talents to good use and their devotion to their cause. Since Jesuits educated Weishaupt, he was familiar with their experiences of creating to talitarian societies and his prototype 41"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"was above all the totalitarian and theocratic rule, which the Jesuits enforced, in spite of the Spanish central power, in Paraguay in 1609. This slave state existed officially fo r 159 years, up to 1768 when Weishaupt was a twenty-year-old student. The Jesuits called this serfdom enco- mienda, meaning mission or protection. The facts I found in Carl Morner's dissertation \"An Account of the History of Paraguay and the Pertaining Jesuit Missions from the Discovery of the Country to 1813\" (Uppsala, 1858, pp. 92-102) call for consideration. According to Morner, every mission had a municipal council, which carried out the Jesuits' orders. The Jesuits followed a kind of communist method, using cunning and violence. Guarani Indians of both sexes and all ages were put to forced labour for the mission. The Indians did not have any personal property. All the produce was gathered in communal storehouses. Whatever food and clothing the Indians needed, as well as the general needs of the commune, were distributed from these. The Jesuits oversaw the work in a factory manner. The Jesuits had introduced work duty. The supply of food and other necessities to the Indians depended on the results of production. The power structure was centralised and work was performed in groups. The commune even organised entertainment. When punishment was meted out, the Indians were made to kiss the hand of their executioner, thank him and express their remorse. The commune leadership was comprised of Jesuit priests from Italy, England and Germany. They had cordoned off the area in a manner remi- niscent of a ghetto or Eastern Europe behind the iron curtain. All this strengthened the idea that the Jesuits aspired to create an independent state. \"Savage\" Indians from nearby areas were tempted into the enclosed communes with good food, kindness, parties and music. There was no suggestion of the coercion and servitude to come. Then the trap closed around them. The Jesuits distributed the \"savages\" among the missions on the Parana River. Many fled home into the jungles only to be enslaved again later. The Indians were turned into helpless, dependent creatures. Their chances for spiritual development were curbed. Special Jesuit priests (like politruks) indoctrinated the Indians not to express their dissatisfaction. Christianity, originally a religion intended for slaves, was used cunningly. 42"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"At the same time, they tried to accustom the Indians to a militarist attitude and in this way they became the tools of their masters without any thought or will of their own. Paraguay was an example of standardisation, the \"right of co-determination\", the factory mentality, communist methods, an iron curtain (the area was turned into a ghetto), politruks, servitude, vio- lence, propaganda and militarism. An interesting fact is that primarily Central European Jesuits (of Jewish stock) were chosen as leaders of the Paraguay missions. Information about the real conditions eventually reached the outside world despite all hypocrisy and double-dealing. In 1759, the Jesuits were ordered to release the Indians and abolish their isolation system. Naturally, the Jesuits claimed that all the accusations brought against them were false but they still admitted that something should be done and offered to help the Indians to gradually become independent again. They had no intention of keeping their promise. Meanwhile, in Europe, the animosity against the Jesuit Order grew and King Carlos III of Spain expelled the Jesuits from all his provinces in 1767. The Jesuits in Paraguay shared the fate of their brothers. One year later, in 1768, they officially left their missions without resistance - missions, which had, through their communist way of life, stifled the spiritual development of the Indians. Thereby, the Jesuits had gathered experience of indoctrinating the exceedingly freedom-loving Indian nations, and of changing them into obedient slaves in their \"commune\". Within only eight years, in 1776, the Jesuit defector Adam Weishaupt formed the Order of the Illuminati. In actual fact, the Jesuits kept their ghettos until well into the nineteenth century. Slavery was abolished in 1843. The Illuminati's First Coup d'Etat Adam Weishaupt also worked intensively as a member of the Masonic order Grand Orient to prepare a so-called revolution. (Nesta Webster, \"The French Revolution\", London, 1919, pp. 20-21.) At the same time, the Illuminati had gained a secure footing in France. A Portuguese Jew, Martinez Paschalis, had formed Illuminati groups all over the country up to 1787. Count Honore Gabriel Riqueti de Mirabeau (alias Leonidas) became the most important Illuminati leader. 43"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Another important Illuminatus, the writer and publisher Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793), alias Amelius, had travelled to Paris in the same year to organise the French revolution and to give the go-ahead signal for the rebellion two years later, according to Johannes Rogalla von Bieberstein's book \"Die These von der Verschworung 1776-1945\" (Frankfurt am Main, 1978). As an Illuminatus, Bode had been successful in making contacts with other freemasons, also in Sweden. He published the first Masonic periodical during the years 1116-1119. He also took part in the Masonic convention in Wilhelmsbad in 1782. Weishaupt had earlier sent the Jew Giuseppe Balsamo (born 8th June 1743 in Palermo), who presented himself under the false title of Count Alessandro Cagliostro, to France so that the Illuminati would control the French Masonic orders. Cagliostro-Balsamo had been recruited in Frankfurt am Main in 1781. (\"The Trail of the Serpent\", Hawthorne, California, 1936, p. 163.) One year earlier he had declared himself leader of the Egyptian freemasonry. Cagliostro also took part in the important Masonic congress in Paris on the 15th February 1785. Cagliostro was expelled from France in 1786 in connection with the \"necklace affair\". He was jailed in Rome in 1789, after attempting to set up a Masonic lodge and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He died on the 26th August 1795. Rothschild's most important lackey, Weishaupt, was also sent to Paris with unlimited funds to bribe capable men, organise a revolt and depose the king. A secret committee was set up at the Masonic convention in February 1785 to co-ordinate the actions of the revolution. It included Saint-Martin, Etrilla, Franz Anton Mesmer, Cagliostro, Mirabeau, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (actually T. Perigord), Bode, Dahlberg, Baron de Gleichen, Lavater, Count Louis de Hesse, and representatives of the Grand Orient from Poland and Lithuania. (\"The Trail of the Serpent\", p. 73.) Weishaupt always played a leading role at the Illuminati's meetings in Paris. He invited thousands of murderers to Paris. Many lampoons against Queen Marie Antoinette began to circulate in Paris (Svenska Dagbladet, 27th September 1987). After this, leaflets were spread to incite the people to revolt. The aim of the freemasons was to dethrone the king. The propaganda machine was skilfully tended. Marie Antoinette became a symbol of all evil in the kingdom. 44"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"These so-called revolutionaries, who worked to undermine the established order, were often young and many among them were Jews or freemasons, according to the historian Henrik Berggren, Ph. D. (Dagens Syheter, 20th January 1987, Berggren's \"The Grammar of the Revo- lution\"). The three hundred men who seized power under the French Revolution were all Illuminati. (Gerald B. Winrod, \"Adam Weishaupt - a Human Devil\", p. 37.) Marat and Robespierre officially belonged to a \"revolutionary\" organisation, The embittered. The Association of equals had also been active in Paris since 1786. This organisation had, in the same year, already decided where to imprison the \"enemies of the people\". The revolutionary leaders Mirabeau, Garat, Robespierre, Marat, Danton, Desmoulins and many others were Illuminati, according to Gerald B. Winrod, \"Adam Weishaupt - a Human Devil\" (p. 36). According to Nesta Webster, Danton and Mirabeau were originally members of the Masonic lodge Les Amis Reunis (The Reunited Friends), upon which the Illuminati also put their mark. Louis Leon Saint-Just, called one of the fathers of totalitarianism, was also a freemason. The Illuminati took over the Jacobin clubs already in 1789. 152 of these clubs were active on the 10th August 1790, according to the Encyclo- paedia Britannica. The Jacobins had a centralised network over all France. The first club was taken over by We ishaupt's close collaborators Bode and Baron de Busche. The Jacobin funds amounted to 30 million livres in 1791. Honest researchers have pointed out that the history of the Jacobins is in fact a part of the history of the Illuminati. We must not forget that one of Weishaupt's titles was \"Patriarch of the Jacobins\". The Jacobins also wore red caps, which they called \"caps of liberty\" or Jacobin caps. According to the still current propaganda, Louis XVI was a merciless and stupid tyrant. In actual fact, he was a kind, well-meaning person, a warmly religious family man and, bes ides, extremely clever and well-read, according to the French historian Eric Le Nabour's biography of the king, \"Le pouvoir et la fatalite\" (\"Power and Destiny\"). He often read his encyclopaedias. Louis was so near-sighted that he had difficulty recognising people only a few yards away. He was a good locksmith and had a knowledge of mechanics, which surprised contemporary experts. He liked carpentry and woodwork. The king had no interest in the glamorous aspects of court life. Louis was 16 when he married the 14-year-old Marie Antoinette. He never travelled abroad. 45"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Illuminati have managed to present as negative a picture of Louis XVI and his France as possible to the post-revolutionary world. It was not the extravagance and wasteful spending of the court that caused the enormous state deficit, but rather France's support of the American Revo- lution. The costs of the war against England became astronomical. Louis XVI was the first head of state of the Old World to recognise this new republic. Gustavus III was the second. Louis XVI had reformed the judicial system, abolished torture in 1788, humanised the prisons and developed the h ealth service. He paved the way for the fall of the monarchy through constant, small concessions to the freemasons and the Illuminati. The revolution was not organised in a desti- tute country, but in a flourishing nation. France's exports had multiplied ten times during the century. Industry and agriculture had made great ad- vances. The French network of more than 40 000 kilometres of stone- paved roads was admired by an amazed world. (Rene Sedillot, \"Le cout de la Revolution francaise\" / \"The Cost of the French Revolution\", Paris, 1986.) A presage of the catastrophe to come occurred almost exactly a year earlier, on the morning of the 13th July 1788, when a great storm swept across the country. In a few minutes, the temperature dropped 13 degrees, the sun was hidden and hailstones the size of a baby's head swept over the richest farming country in the land - 900 000 hectares were affected, trees were uprooted, vineyards destroyed and harvests spoiled. Over a thousand villages suffered. Roofs blew off and church steeples were brought down. It was not long before the superstitious were proved right - it was a terrible sign of calamity and violent, sudden death. Neither was it a good sign that the price of bread began to rise day by day, hordes of beggars moved along the roads and over 100 000 destitute people found their way to Paris. Another bad omen was that the winter of 1788-1789 in France was extremely severe. The harbour of Marseille froze over. All traffic between Dover and Calais stopped. The mills iced over and could not grind flour, so that the shortage of bread became disastrous. This is why the populace could be incited to revolt. The riots went on throughout the winter. On the 1st of March 1789, the 19-year-old lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to Dijon to crush a riot but he refused to take the king's side. He chose to go over to the revolutionaries. 46"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Dark Illuminati forces fomented the riots in the French countryside. The dcbts owed on the state deficit consumed half of the French budget. All this money found its way into the hands of profiteering Jewish money- lenders. All of these factors were exploited. The time to strike had come for the conspirators, who had united the Jacobin clubs. As a kind of prelude, Mirabeau called in the Estates-General on May 5th 1789, just after the thirteenth anniversary of the Illuminati's founding. Marx described Mirabeau as the \"lion of the revolution\". At the beginning of the revolution, there were 282 Masonic lodges in France, of which 266 were controlled by the Illuminati, according to Nesta Webster (\"World Revolution\", London, 1921, p. 28). It was these same groups which organised all the riots and troubles. On the 13th of July 1789, at 11 o'clock, the conspirators gathered at the church of Prix Saint-Antoine where they set up a revolutionary committee and discussed how to organise the revolutionary militia. Dufour from the Grand Orient chaired the meeting. Even the fall of the Bastille was planned by these freemasons, according to Gustave Bord's testimony. (V. Ivanov, \"The Secrets of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1992, p. 120.) On the following day, July 14th, people were incited to head for the Bastille fortress with axes in their hands. Contrary to what the Illuminati's myths say about it, there was no storming and capture of the Bastille. It simply capitulated to the threats of four freemasons. In this way the Bastille was taken. Actually, it was quite meaningless to take the Bastille - the authorities had already decided to demolish it to build a housing area. Not a single political prisoner was found in the Bastille. There were only seven people incarcerated there. Four of these were infamous frauds and forgers. The young Comte des Solages had been imprisoned at his father's bidding since he had committed serious offences (incest). Two of the Bastille inmates were mentally ill; one of these was an Irishman with a three foot long beard who claimed to be God himself. The revolutionaries continued to mislead the people by showing them a printing press, which they claimed, was an instrument of torture. They also asscrted that an old suit of armour had been used as a straitjacket for refractory prisoners. Actually, the prisoners had had it fairly easy. They had their own furniture and were allowed to wear their normal clothes. They were also 47"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"served several courses for dinner. The dungeons had been used to store wine. The warders had been decent, and visits from friends and relatives had frequently been allowed. The library was of a high standard. The daily walks in the little garden of the Bastille had been pleasant. The freemasons, headed by Camille Desmoulins, agitated the people more and more intensively with shouts of \"Down with the Bastille!\" The tumult cost 83 attackers their lives. Another 73 were injured, of which 15 later died of their injuries (Svenska Dagbladet, 25th June 1989). Earlier, the liberal governor had even invited the freemasons' messenger to dinner! He was tortured and killed by the crowd. His head was cut off and carried in triumph on a pole through Paris. Afterwards, three officers were murdered and two invalids were hanged. The \"revolutionaries\" waved their red flags. Afterwards, agents of the freemasons were sent out across the country. Their main task was to foster panic simultaneously in most of the provinces. During this summer of famine, they began to spread lies in different cities and villages about the roaming bands of beggars and unemployed, calling them bandits and arsonists who killed women and children. They also lied about an impending attack by the Germans and the English. Within 36 hours these evil rumours had reached the great masses around the country and created an enormous panic on the 22nd of July. The leaflets appeared to be official declarations. They would read: \"By order of his Majesty, the burning of all castles and the hanging of anyone who opposes this is allowed from the 1st August until the 1st November.\" People were taken in by these lies. The peasants took up arms. They attacked and plundered manors and castles. They burned terriers and other documents and thereby also burned their own history. Behind the idea of the \"Day of Terror\" was the freemason Adrien Du- pont, who wanted to exploit the people as much as he could for \"revo- lutionary\" reasons, according to Nesta Webster (\"World Revolution\", London, 1921, pp. 31-32). To speed up their own seizure of power, the freemasons checked any attempted reforms. The National Assembly was moved into an old manege on the Rue de Rivoli in October 1789. The radicals sat to the left of the chairman, the conservatives to the right. Hence the Illuminati created left and right as ideological concepts in world politics. Everything that had to do with the left was thereafter considered progressive since it was true Illuminism. 48"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The murders began under Rothschild's red banner and the Illuminist slogans: \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!\" and \"Freedom or Death!\" In Lyon the \"enemies of the people\" were shot down with cannons, in Nantes, following the slaughter of 500 children, 144 seamstresses were drowned in old barges on the Loire River. Their \"crime\": they had sewn shirts for the army. People were executed without trial, despite the ostensible introduction of so-called revolutionary tribunals in September 1789. One of the judges presiding at these tribunals was the perverted Marquis Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade, who had been brought straight from a mental hospital. De Sade was responsible for giving the concept \"sadism\" a name. He also died in a mental hospital. The Illuminist coup in France brought none of the improvements that corrupt historians try to make us believe in; instead it resulted in an orgy of violence and intrigue. To make the killing more efficient, the \"revolutionaries\" began using the guillotine in April 1792. The idea originally came from Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, a professor in anatomy. The doctor and freemason Antoine Louis constructed the killing machine. The record of Henri Samson, the chief executioner, was 21 heads in 38 minutes. The real reign of terror, however, began on the 10th of August 1792, which was a Yahweh day, when the monarchy was abolished and the Paris commune was established. The commune leadership included 288 Illu- minati headed by Chaumette, Danton and Robespierre. The leaders of the Jacobins and especially of the Enraged (Les Enrages) wanted to destroy all who had shown any misgivings about the \"revolution\". Georges Jacques Danton, infamous as a rogue, became minister of justice. He wanted every suspect imprisoned. Many priests and relatives of emigrants were also incarcerated. In this way the leaders of the revolution gained access to enormous assets. Danton himself became incredibly rich. Earlier, he had taken large bribes from those wishing to save their lives. In the beginning of September 1792, Danton encouraged the mobs to massacre the \"enemies of the people\". In Paris alone, 2800 people were murdered between the 2nd and 4th of September, according to the historian Nesta Webster. Among the victims of this bloodbath was a friend of the queen, Princess de Lamballe, who was attacked in the street and hacked to pieces. Every aristocrat was automatically guilty, but only those who threatened the Jacobins' position perished. The Jacobins had begun to shut 49"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the Masonic lodges - they had played their part. In 1794 there were only 12 lodges left, those most useful to the Illuminati. The king's cousin, the Duke of Orleans, who had begun to call himself Philippe Egalite (equality) was also guillotined despite having renounced his title and in 1792 leaving his position as Grand Master of the Grand Orient which he had held for 20 years since the founding of the Order. He knew too much about the preparations for the revolution. He had worked with the Jacobins in the hope that he might be allowed to take the throne as a constitutional monarch. Philippe Egalite explained why he left the Grand Orient in the following manner: \"...I no longer know who belongs to the Grand Orient. Therefore, I believe that the Republic should no longer allow any secret societies. I no longer want to have anything to do with the Grand Orient and Masonic meetings.\" The Illuminati could not forgive this and exacted their revenge upon him, despite the fact that his vote had been decisive in the process of deposing the king. Nothing was said about guilty peasants and workers but it was mainly they who suffered from the \"revolutionary\" punishments. Marat wanted 100 000 people guillotined to scare the enemies of the \"revolution\". Saint- Just promised in the name of the republic to eliminate all adversaries. The Jacobins' (Illuminati's) terrorism claimed 300 000 human lives, according to Nesta Webster (\"World Revolution\", London, 1921, p. 47). The historian Rene Sedillot, in his book \"The Cost of the French Revolution\", calculates that the \"revolution\", on account of the terrorism and the civil war, claimed at least 600 000 victims. Charlotte Corday murdered the powerful and bloodthirsty freemason Marat on the 13th of July 1793. Less than one in ten of those guillotined were aristocrats. This was revealed just before the 200th anniversary of the revolution. This in- formation is based on the protocols of the revolutionary tribunals, which include the names of all those executed. Nine per cent of the decapitated \"enemies of the people\" were nobles, 28 per cent peasants and 30 per cent workers. The rest were servants. (Dagens Nyheter, 1st July 1989.) In other words, those killed were quite ordinary people. In Paris alone, 30 people were executed every day. The Jacobi n executioners usually preferred blonde victims. In 1903, Lenin proclaimed: \"A Russian social democrat must be a Jacobin.\" 50"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"This was just the beginning. After the \"revolution\" came the wars. The Jacobins explained in their inflammatory speeches how \"a war would be a blessing for the nation. The worst thing that could happen to us now would be if we did not get a war\". On the 20th of April 1792, France declared war on Austria. After that, Belgium, Holland and parts of Ger- many were invaded. All those wars claimed two million lives. All of France's 27 million inhabitants were made to suffer from this madness. With the help of French \"revolutionary\" troops, the Republic or Com- mune of Mainz, Germany, was proclaimed on the 18th of March, 1793. The 18th of March had a special significance for the Illuminist conspira- tors. On the same day in 1314, the Jewish Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake. Because of this, some of the more important Illuminati actions were planned for just this day, as a kind of revenge for his execution. Revolts were organised to break out on the 18th of March, 1848, in several European countries. A coup was staged in Paris on this day (1871) after which the Illuminati proclaimed the Paris Commune. Thanks to the efforts of the Prussian army, the snake-pit in Mainz was liquidated only four months later - on the 23rd of July 1793. Goethe accompani ed the Prussian army as early as 1792 in its campaign against the \"lawless Frenchmen\". (Dagens Nyheter, 4th of February 1989.) On the 17th of January 1795, a revolutionary \"sister-state\" was founded in the Netherlands - the republic of Batavia, where Amsterdam became the capital. Napoleon oversaw the conversion of this state into the king- dom of Holland in 1806. Jewish \"revolutionaries\" immediately saw to it that the Jews received full citizenship and so that they had their hands free to act. Maximilien Marie Isidore Robespierre (1758-1794) published a work entitled \"To Protect the Political Rights of the Jews\" as early as in 1789. Protection of Jewish rights was obviously considered the main priority. Louis Joseph Marchand, friend of Napoleon Bonaparte, wrote in 1895 that Robespierre was actually a Jew by the name of Ruban from Alsace (\"In Napoleon's Shadow,\" San Francisco, 1998). The slogan which best summed up the Jacobins' aims was: \"All power to the bourgeoisie!\" (the Illuminati). And the power certainly became centralised in France, according to Leo Gershoy, \"The Era of the French Revolution 1789-1799\" (New York, 1957, p. 41). 51"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Everything that was non-essential was suddenly presented as essential. However, the Buddhist work Dhammapada (11-12) says of this: Those who take the non-real for the real and the real for the non-real and thus fall victims to erroneous notions never reach the essence of reality. Having realised the essential as the essential and the non-essential as the non-essential, they by thus following correct thinking attain the essential. Illuminist Jews saw to it that everything that was good about France was destroyed during the \"revolution\". What was good disappeared at the same rate that the evil grew. The road network was allowed to fall into disrepair, overseas trade ceased almost entirely and it took until 1809 for the industrial production to reach its pre-Revolutionary levels again, according to the historian Rene Sedillot (\"Le cout de la Revolution francaise\" / \"The Cost of the French Revolution\"). Many villages were razed to the ground, churches and castles were destroyed on purpose. The cultural heritage was ravaged, including medieval buildings. The largest Romanesque architectural structure, the 10th century abbey in Cluny, was destroyed. Only one tower remains today. Those barbarians even began to tear down the Papal Palace in Avignon. The steeple on the Notre-Dame of Paris was considered offensively tall and was torn down. At the same time, the \"revolutionaries\" began to plunder castles of their art treasures. The Jewish writer Anatole France described in his book \"The Thirsty Gods\" how inspectors with tricolour ribbons around their collars began to turn up at the homes of the wealthy to search for riches. Delighted foreign art dealers bought sculptures and fragments of frescoes. Load after load of confiscated art collections were shipped over the English Channel. The \"revolution\" was lucrative for the Illuminati and the speculators. All of this was repeated during and after the so-called Russian revolution. The mighty finance dynasty of the Rothschilds was born out of the French \"revolution\". The Rothschilds are still in control behind the scenes today, especially within the European Union. 52"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The government reached a deficit that made the pre-Revolutionary debts seem quite modest in comparison. The debt equalled 800 tons of gold, or 40 per cent of the total gold production of the world during the entire 18th century. The real losers in the \"revolution\" were the Illuminati's tools - the simple people. The land rights of the small peasants were taken away. The church charities ceased abruptly and any attempt at improving the conditions for loan-takers was regarded as a conspiracy against the state. The ranks of derelicts swelled. During Napoleon's days one in five Parisians lived by begging. The myth maintains that this was done to throw off the yoke of tyranny and to protect human rights. In actual fact, the Illuministic reign of terror abolished human rights altogether. It became forbidden for workers to organise and strike for better conditions. This prohibition was legislated on the 14th of June 1791. (Etienne Martin-Saint-Leon, \"Les deux C.G.T., syndicalisme et communisme\", Paris, 1923, p. 7.) The theatres were given free rein at the beginning, but later the actors began to be punished for undesirable productions. The Academy of Art was closed and anyone who wanted could call himself an artist. Anyone was allowed to be a doctor and to mix medicines, which had a very negative effect on the state of general health in France - but then, maybe this was the intention? The 21st of January 1793, the Jewish chief executioner and freemason, Samson, and Samson's son Henry executed Louis XVI. Samson said: \"Louis, son of the holy one, rise up to heaven!\" The execution of the king was celebrated every year until Napol eon's coup in Bruimare (November) 1799. (Dagens Nyheter, 25th January 1989.) Even the word \"roi\" (king) was abolished. Marie Antoinette was executed on the 16th of October (Yahweh's Doomsday) in 1793. The young Hungarian philosopher Ferenc Feher, Lukacs's disciple, living in New York, claimed in 1989 that Louis XVI was judged on political, not judicial, grounds. Because of this, he ascertained that it was terrorism, not democracy that was introduced. Feher believed that what was built up after the French revolution was simply unfounded law- lessness. (Expressen, 21st of August 1989.) The playwright Eugene Ionesco observed in 1990 that this revolution was a big mistake, which led to the spread of the most terrible false doctrine in history. 53"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Illuminati wanted to completely politicise society. This was the job of the \"insinuating brothers\" under the name of the \"Committee of National Security \" with its chief Chauvelin. At the same time, society was being undermined through the secret lodges, which began to prepare a dictatorship and a world revolution, which was intended to utterly overthrow the social order. This world revolution was designed to be accomplished by a handful of Illuminist conductors. (Svenska Dagbladet, 16th August 1989.) The homosexual Robespierre was publicly regarded as a tyrant or dictator. The new rulers demanded that the populace address all as \"citizens\". The year was to begin upon a new day, the months were renamed, and the week became a 10-day period. An hour consisted of 100 minutes. All these idiocies were abolished by Napoleon in 1806. The peasants in the Vendee province had had enough of all this \"revolutionary\" stupidity: their king had been murdered, schooling had been abolished, their oldest sons had all been enrolled into the army. On the 10th of March 1793, they rebelled. At the beginning they were quite successful but when the Jacobins realised that the populace was beginning to threaten their position, they imposed their dictatorship, which began on the 31st of May 1793, and lasted until March 1794. The terrorism during that period was the worst yet seen. Virtually rampaging marauders murdered everyone in the province of Vendee. Only 12 000 people in the whole province survived the assaults. One general reported to Paris: \"Vendee has ceased to exist.\" Another wrote that his band of army raiders daily managed to kill 2000 people. A new rebellion went on during the years 1794-95. In total, 600000 lives were extinguished in the Vendee province. In their struggle for power, some \"revolutionaries\" even happened to execute each other. Some leaders, above all those who wanted to limit the extent of the terrorism, were done away with (Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins and other Dantonites went to the guillotine on the 5th of April 1794 as \"enemies of the people\"). This awful end also awaited Robes- pierre. On the 27th of July 1794, the leader of the Jacobins was arrested together with other leading Communards (his brother Augustin, Saint-Just and Georges Gouthon) and was guillotined without trial. The reign of terror was over. The directors dissolved the Paris Commune on the 26th of October 1795. 54"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The famous French historian Urbain G ohier revealed in his book \"The Old France\" (1922) how a certain speech, which Robespierre held for two hours at the convention on the 26th of July 1794, had meant his end. He condemned all the eager foreign agents who tried to direct the develop- ment of commerce in France too intensively and demanded that those agents be rendered harmless. On the following day he was arrested together with his brother, Saint-Just and Georges Gouthon. All of them were executed without trial on the 28th of July. This speech has been left out of the official version of events. Officially, the \"revolutionaries\" justified their craving for power as \"moral\", but the people were forced to be \"virtuous\" and to change their minds. These experiences were exploited later in Russia when the Illuminati, who called themselves Bolsheviks, paid homage to the men responsible for this revolutionary terrorism: a statue of Robespierre (Ruban), whose family had immigrated to France from Ireland, was erected and a massive armoured cruiser (as well as several factories) were given the name Marat (actually Mosessohn). What have Jewish ideologues said about this \"revolution\" in France? Archives Israelites admitted very ambiguously on the 6th of June 1889: \"The French Revolution has a very expressive Hebraic character.\" The aim of this new politics, pursued for the people's (the Illuminati's) own best, was indubitably totalitarian (Svenska Dagbladet, 14th March 1989). Later, the question arose whether this conspiracy to overthrow the church and the state had begun somewhere in Germany (Svenska Dag- bladet, 16th august 1989). Other states now sought to defend themselves against Illuminism. The Turks dismissed s uggestions from Russia to take a joint action against France. Gustavus III was also prepared to send 16 000 Swedish soldiers to help forge a European alliance to crush the French Revolution. He banned the Marseillaise in Sweden. Because of this, the earlier decision to murder the king was carried out. On the 16th of March 1792, Gustavus III was fatally wounded at a masked ball by the freemason Jakob Johan Anckarstrom. The king had been warned about possible assassination attempts but had not taken these warnings seriously. A bust of Anckarstrom stands in the lodge chamber of the Grand Orient in Paris. In 1818 the freemasons put one of their agents from France on the Swedish throne - Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. 55"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Illuminati's Way to World Power Despite occasional setbacks (through Napoleon's treachery) the Illuminati continued on their way to gaining world power. Queen Marie Antoinette had warned her brother, Emperor Leopold II, about this in a letter: \"Be very careful of the Masonic lodges; you may already have been told about these. The beasts here count on achieving their aims in all countries. Oh God! Protect my fatherland and yourself from such a fate!\" The international Illuminati leaders held a conference in New York in 1850. They made preparations to start an International. An American com- mittee was set up. Clinton Roosevelt, Horace Greeley and Charles Dana became its leaders. Another group was formed to co-ordinate acts off terrorism. The Italian Jew Giuseppe Mazzini (born 1805 in Genoa) was selected to lead this group. He had been an Illuminatus since 1837 and was a freemason of the highest (33rd) degree. He assumed leadership of the Bavarian Illuminati. After Mazzini's death in 1872 his position was taken over by the Jew Adriano Lemmi, who was a revolutionary conspirator and Grand Master of the Grand Orient in Italy. The first enthusiast for! Illuminism in Italy was Count Fi lippo Struzzi, who founded many lodges around Italy and acted as their leader. (Charles William Heckethorn, \"Secret Societies\", Moscow, 1993, p. 206.) Giuseppe Garibaldi was also an Illuminatus. The members of the Garibaldi movement wore red shirts. Terrible atrocities began to take place in Italy, France, Spain, Austria and Russia after the aforementioned conference. Mazzini had the Duke of Parma murdered in 1854, as well as the judges who sentenced the murderers. Violent anarchists raged about until the beginning of the First World War. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives. The world was to be divided into different blocks, which were to be put into violent opposition to each other. This operation was controlled from London. On the 29th of July 1900, King Umberto I was murdered by the freemason Gaetano Bresci in Monza, despite the fact that he was a member of the lodge Savoia Illuminata. The murderer Bresci belonged to an American lodge in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1861, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the U.S.A. He became a stumbling block to the Illuminati, however. First, the Civil War was started (the Confederacy was funded by Illuminist France). The Illuminati had worked hard to get the United States to use the same 56"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"banking system as the European count ries, where private banks handled the issuing of money so that governments were forced to incur debt at high interest rates. Lincoln opposed this and refused to give the Rothschild bank control over the American economy. Hence, the Jewish Illuminatus John Wilkes Booth murdered him on the 15th of April 1865 in Washington, only a few days after the end of the war. Lincoln's murderer was also disposed of. Judah P. Benjamin, Rothschild's agent, lurked behind Booth. (William Guy Carr, \"The Red Fog Over America\", 1968, p. 194.) The Confederate general Albert Pike (born on December 19, 1809 in Boston) became, as a freemason, a member of the American Illuminati group towards the end of the 1850s. Mazzini's revolutionary activities (anarchic violence) brought discredit on the Grand Orient. Therefore, Mazzini suggested the founding of a new, extremely secret organisation, the Palladium. No mention of it would ever be made in the assemblies of thc Lodges and Inner Shrines of other rites. For the secret of the new insti- tution was only to be divulged with the greatest caution to a chosen few belonging to the ordinary high grades, according to the historian Dome- nico Margiotta in his book \"Adriano Lemmi\" (Grenoble, 1894, p. 97). Giuseppe Mazzini sent a letter to Albert Pike on the 22nd of January 1870, in which he wrote among other things: \"With this highest rite, we shall rule all freemasonry; it will become the international centre which will make us all the more mighty because its leadership is unknown.\" The same Albert Pike set up this extremely secret organisation, which was called The New and Reformed Palladian Rite. The organisation first had three important centres: Charleston in the United States of America, Rome in Italy and Berlin in Germany. Through Mazzini's work, the organisation set up altogether 23 subordinate councils at strategic locations around the world. Palladianism actually became a satani c cult. This cult, or religion, worshipped Lucifer as a god. Its oath proves this: \"The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.\" General Pike was an exceptionally evil man. During the American Civil War, when he served under the Confederate flag, his army, composed of Indian bands from different tribes, perpetrated such atrocious massacres that Great Britain threatened to enter the war \"for humanitarian reasons\". 57"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Consequently, the Confederate president Jefferson Davis (1809-1889) was forced to intervene against his own general and disband his troops. After the civil war, Pike was taken to trial and sentenced to prison for his crimes. The freemasons immediately turned to President Andrew John- son, who was a freemason himself (Greenville Lodge No. 19). On 22 April 1866, President Johnson pardoned him. The following day, Pike visited the president in the White House. Johnson was subordinate to Pike within freemasonry. The press was not informed about this event until nine months later. (William T. Still, \"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies\", Lafayette, Louisiana, 1990, p. 123.) Albert Pike was one of the founders of the infamous racist organisation, the Ku Klux Klan. He was the first Grand Dragon of the Klan and wrote the anthem and the rules of the organisation. The freemasons have erected a monument in honour of Albert Pike in Judiciary Square in central Washington D.C. The plaque on the statue presents Pike as a \"soldier\" and a \"poet\". Albert Pike was very enamoured with the idea of world dominion. In time, he became an Illuminatus of the highest (33rd) degree and in his 58 "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"mansion in Little Rock, he made plans to gain control over the world with the aid of three world wars and several revolutions. In a letter to Mazzini, dated the 15th of August 1871, Pike broadly outlines his long-term plan for the seizure of power in the whole world. One might expect the Illuminati to be more careful with their papers, so that their plans were not made public - but anyone who knows their history also knows that humanity will never take warning in time. Professor Carroll Quigley (also an Illuminatus) realised this. Public opinion, the majority of politicians, and social scientists are at any event unable to accept facts, which contradict their deeply held belief that they understand and control all that happens in society. Both Lenin and Hitler openly revealed their real aims years before they ever came to power. Did the nations heed the warning? No, they preferred to go on sleeping. It is no different today. The Illuminati know this. Pike's plan was ingeniously simple. The inherent antagonism between different ideologies was to be stirred up and made to explode in three world wars and three revolutions. The First World War was to destroy the three European empires, at that time being the last remaining bulwarks against Illuminism. One of these (Russia) was to be made a centre of atheist totalitarianism (Communism). The Second World War was to erupt from heightened tensions between the Jewish race (and its spiteful Zionism) and extreme European nationa lism (Nazism and Fascism). This war would weaken Europe economically and politically and Communism wouId expand and become as strong as all Christendom, but not stronger, until the time was up for the final destruction of society. A third reason for the Second World War was to create a Jewish state in Palestine. Gradually, it would be possible to thereby heighten the tensions between Judaism and Islam until they broke out in a war which would bring in all of the world powers. The three revolutions, which would aid this carefully planned dissolution of all human civilisations, were the Russian, the Chinese and the Indo-Chinese. The historian Domenico Margiotta published the letter in his book (\"Le Palladisme: Culte de Satan-Lucifer\", Grenoble, 1895, p. 186). The reader will realise that most of this evil plan has already become reality. Concerning the last stage, General Pike wrote the following: \"We shall unleash the Nihilists and Atheists and provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the 59"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment on be without compass (direction), anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view, a manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.\" The reader will remember how atheist Communism in the Soviet Union suddenly came to an end in 1991. More about this at the end of the book. Albert Pike wrote in his \"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Scottish Freemasonry\" (1871): \"Masonry has nothing whatsoever to do with the Bible, it is not founded on the Bible, for if it were, then it would not be masonry, it would be something else!\" The Jewish politician Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) in Great Britain, a contemporary of Pike and Mazzini, was, as a Frankist, kept well informed about the Illuminati's incredible power. He had always done what Rothschild wished. In his book \"Lord George Bentinck: a Political Biography\" (first published in 1852) he wrote the following revealing words, which were as valid then as 146 years later (London, 1882, pp. 397-398): \"It was neither the parliaments nor populations, nor the course of nature, nor the course of events, that overthrew the throne of Louis Philippe... the throne was surprised by the secret societies, ever prepared to ravage Europe... The secret associations are always vigilant and always pre- pared.\" The leading Jewish Illuminatus Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who became president of the United States of America in 1933, also admitted: \"Nothing happens by chance in politics. If something happens, you can be sure it was planned that way.\" Albert Pike worked hard to make the freemasonry more efficient. Among other reforms, he admitted women as members. Over the years, the Illuminati have moved their headquarters between different cities. In the 1870s it was in Frankfurt am Main. According to 60"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Nordisk Familjebok it was in Berlin in 1907. Brockhaus Enzyklopadie (Wiesbaden, 1970) stated that the Illuminati were legalised in 1896. Their leader then was Leopold Engel, who published the Illuminati's history in 1906 (\"Geschichte des Illuminatenordens\"). According to \"Meyers Enzyklopadisc hes Lexikon\", the various national llluminati groups combined to form a world association in 1925. Accor- ding to Store Norske Lexikon (Oslo, 1979, Vol. 6, p. 183), the Illuminati stil continue their activities as a secret organisation. The Illuminati's headquarters moved to Switzerland during the First World War and to New York after the Second World War (The Harold Pratt building, 58, East 68th Street). The Rockefellers now funded the Illuminati instead of the Rothschilds. (William Guy Carr, \"Pawns in the Game\".) An especially useful tool of the Illuminati in the 20th century has been the I. G. Farben company, led by its Jewish chief Max Warburg. Today, the Illuminati control the whole Masonic movement. They also control Rotary, Lions, B'nai B'rith, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg group, Skull & Bones, Bohemian Club and similar groups. Rotary International was founded by Paul Harris (member of B'nai B'rith) in Chicago in 1905. The Lions Club was also founded by B'nai B'rith in Chicago in 1917. There are more than six million freemasons (3315 lodges) in the world today (four million in the United States of America, 600 000 in Great Britain, 70 000 in France). In Sweden there are 16 000 divided into 56 lodges. A sarcastic survey of various networks was published in the respected magazine The Economist on the 26th of December 1992. The Illuminati were presented as the \"mother of all networks\" and \"the True Rulers of the World\". The magazine names Adam Weishaupt and the 1st of May 1776, and states that the Illuminati's \"conspiracy is immense and terrifying\" and that \"it is the network of those who run networks.\" Then they go on to point out that many American presidents have been Illuminati; some of them have been killed by the Illuminati and the Illiminati symbol - that of the eye in the pyramid - still graces the dollar bill. I found this symbol in the summer of 1986 among other Illuminati documents in the Ingolstadt archives. It was the American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, freemason of the 32nd degree, who ordered the seal to be printed on American one 61"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"dollar bills in 1933, 144 years after Congress had accepted this seal. The seal symbolises that the Illuminati claim to control America, no matter who the president is. * The year MDCCLXXVI on the pyramid stands for 1776, when the Order of the Illuminati was founded, but also when the American Republic was proclaimed. * The pyramid represents the conspira cy to establish a world govern- ment. The All-seeing eye symbolises the secret police that Weishaupt called the \"insinuating brothers\". * Annuit Coeptis means \"He has nodded assent to (our) plans\". * Novus Ordo Seclorum means \"New World Order\". The Illuminati apparently felt so safe that The Economist (their own publication) was allowed to publish this information. In contrast, there is not a single word about the Illuminati in the new Swedish National Ency- clopaedia. This book outlines how the Illuminati's most important ideology - Communism - was spread using guile and violence. The author reveals numerous lies which uninformed people have swallowed in good faith. The Illuminati knew their business. The French socialist and Illuminatus Louis Blanc called Weishaupt the most skilful conspirator through the ages. 62 "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Telling the story of the rise of Communism means revealing the histories of the worst of the criminals involved at the time.

Then we may really be able to welcome the truth, even if it is frightening and dismiss lies, even if they are pleasant. 63 "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"KARL MARX - EVIL'S IDOL On the 5th of May 1818, in the German town of Trier, a baby boy was born and given the name Moses Mordecai Levi Marx. In his early youth, he became known as a Christian. His father, Hirschel ha-Levi Marx, Justice of the Supreme Court, had opportunistically converted to Christianity in 1816. Hirschel's father was a famous Chief Rabbi in Cologne. His father-in-law was also a rabbi. The historian Richard Laufner proved in 1975 that Karl Marx was not born into a Christian family, as they had secretly kept their Jewish faith. This is why he was given a Mosaic name just after his birth. Moses Mordecai Levi was only baptised in 1824, at six years of age, and given the Christian name Karl Heinrich. Young Marx went to a Jesuit school, which had been restructured as a secular high school. At the same time, he went to a Talmudic school, where he learned that the Jews must rule the world. Bernard Lazar (Lazana), (1865-1903), a well-known functionary and publicist within Judaism, confirmed that Marx had been affected by Talmudism. In August 1835, Marx wrote his examination essay for religious studies: \"The Union of the Faithful in Jesus\". In it he wrote, among other things, the following: \"Through our love of Christ, we turn our hearts simultaneously towards our brothers, who are spiritually bound to us and for whom He gave himself as a sacrifice.\" (Marx and Engels, \"Collected Works\", Volume I, New York, 1979.) In his examination essay in German, \"Considerations of a Young Man on Choosing his Career\", he admitted: \"Religion itself teaches us that the Ideal towards which all strive has sacrificed Himself for humanity, and who shall dare contradict such claims?\" After high school, he studied at the University of Bonn and later, in the autumn of 1836, in Berlin, but he took his doctorate in Jena, where the requirements were lower than in Berlin. 64"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"As a young student, Karl Marx went through a total transformation. He began to hate God. This was something he admitted in his brutal poetry. Two of Marx's poems were published during his lifetime in the periodical Athenaeum in Berlin, under the title \"Wild Songs\", on the 23rd of January 1841. Forty poems and the verse drama \"Oulanem\" written by Marx (the title is an anagram of Emanuel, meaning God is with us) have been found to date. He wrote the latter at eighteen years of age. But no one cared about his poetry, which had mostly to do with the end of the world and his love for the girl next door, Jenny von Westphalen. In his poems he threatened to revenge himself upon God and time after time expressed his hatred for the world. He vowed to throw humanity into the abyss and follow after with laughter on his lips. He flung terrible curses at humanity. He did not become an atheist, though. In his poem \"Der Spiel- mann\" (\"The Fiddler\"), he admitted: That art God neither wants nor wists, It leaps to the brain from Hell's black mists. Till heart's bewitched, till senses reel: With Satan I have struck my deal. In another of his poems, Marx promised to lure mankind with him into hell in the company of Satan. These words are reminiscent of Jakob Frank's expressions. This shows that Marx was affected by Frankism. Karl Marx's father had come into contact with Frankism and had also instructed his children in this ideology. This is how young Marx got to know of Frankism, as was mirrored in his poetry. His family's conversion to Christianity was just a social manoeuvre. Jakob Frank himself had done the same, when he became a \"Catholic\". Frank had, in his turn, followed the dreaded Sabbatai Zevi's example of \"changing religion\" for the sake of the cause. Marx was delighted with the idea of humanity's moral ruination. In his poetry, he dreamed of a pact with Satan. He was especially fascinated by violence. Later, in his own ideology, he stressed that one must fight violence with violence. He called humanity \"the apes of the cold god\". Marx's religion is clearly revealed in his poem \"Invocation of One in Despair\" (Karl Marx, \"Collected Works\", Vol. I, New York, 1974): 65"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"So a god has snatched from me my all In the curse and rack of destiny. All his worlds are gone beyond recall! Nothing but revenge is left to me. I shall build my throne high overhead, Cold, tremendous shall its summit be. For its bulwark - superstitious dread. For its Marshal - blackest agony. Who looks on it with a healthy eye, Shall turn back, deathly pale and dumb, Clutched by blind and chill mortality, May his happiness prepare its tomb. Here is the ending of the drama \"Oulanem\" (from Robert Payne's \"The Unknown Karl Marx\", New York University Press, 1971): If there is something which devours, I'll leap within it, though I bring the world to ruins - The world which bulks between me and the abyss I will smash to pieces my enduring curses. I'll throw my arms around its harsh reality, Embracing me, the world will dumbly pass away, And then sink down to utter nothingness, Perished, with no existence - that would be really living. In his poem \"The Pale Maiden\" Marx writes: Thus heaven I've forfeited, I know it full well. My soul, once true to God, Is chosen for hell. 66"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"In another of Marx's poems, \"Human Pride\" (published in \"World Revolution\" by Nesta Webster, p. 167), he writes the following: With disdain I will throw my gauntlet Full in the face of the world, And see the collapse of this pygmy giant Whose fall will not stifle my ardour. Then I will be able to walk triumphantly Like a god, through the ruins of their kingdom. Every word of mine is fire and action. My breast is equal to that of the Creator. The spirit of these poems was also evident in his \"Communist Mani- festo\" and his later speeches. On April 14th, 1856, he said: \"History is the judge, the proletariat its executioner.\" (Paul Johnson, \"The Intellectuals\", Stockholm, 1989, p. 74.) Marx found great pleasure in talking about terror, about houses marked with red crosses indicating that the inhabitants were to be killed. Moses Hess - the Teacher of Marx and Engels Karl Marx's worship of violence was strengthened by a Frankist commu- nist whom he met in 1841, when he was 23 years old. This man was called Moritz Moses Hess. Moses Hess was born on the 21st of June 1812 in Bonn, the son of a wealthy Jewish industrialist. He died on the 6th of April 1875 in Paris and is buried in Israel. It can be mentioned that he founded the German Social Democratic Party. In \"Judisches Lexikon\" (Berlin, 1928, pp. 1577-78) he is called a communist rabbi and the father of modern Socialism. In 1841, he founded the newspaper Rheinische Zeitung and one year later he made the 24 year-old Marx its editor. Theodor Zlocist published an interesting book about him in 1921, \"Moses Hess, der Vorkampfer des Sozialismus und Zionismus\". Part of Moses Hess' terrifying world of ideas is disclosed in his book \"Rome and Jerusalem\". 67"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" Moses Hess quickly transformed young Marx into a freemason, a socialist agitator and his minion. Marx was still no communist. He wrote in Rheinische Zeitung, which he edited during the years 1842-43: \"Attempts by masses to carry out Communist ideas can be answered by a cannon as soon as they have become dangerous...\" He then believed these ideas to be impracticable. Moses Hess essentially corrected all these opinions. He became the grey eminence behind Marx, intensively guiding and influencing his protege's work. In Paris, in the autumn of 1844, Moses Hess presented the 26-year-old Marx to the half-Jew Friedrich Engels, who was two years younger. This meeting laid the foundations for their long collaboration. Engels had also expressed Christian ideas in his youth: \"I thirsted for a connection with God. My religion was and is a peaceful and blessed world and I should be pleased with it if it were to be with me also after my funeral. I have no reason to suppose God should take it away from me. Religious persuasion is a thing of the heart. I pray every day, indeed almost all day, for truth. I seek the truth everywhere, even where I hope to find just a shadow of it. 68"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Tears are welling forth as I write this. I am moved through and through, but I feel I will not be lost. I will come to God, for whom my whole soul longs.\" (Marx and Engels, \"From Early Works\", Moscow, 1956, p. 306.) But Engels fell, after he happened to meet Moses Hess in Cologne. After this meeting Hess wrote: \"He parted from me as an over-zealous Communist. This is how I produce ra vages...\" (Moses Hess, \"Selected Works\", Cologne, 1962.) It was this same Moses Hess who thought up the rancorous basis of the socialist-communist ideology. He was also the first to recommend, as a fundamental idea, that all personal property should be abolished. Alexander Volodin actually called Moses Hess a \"philosopher\" in his book \"Herzen\" (Tallinn, 1972, p. 97). What were his remarkable ideas then? In his writings, Moses Hess stressed the need to agitate the social classes against each other and in this way hinder their co-operation. He wanted to bring about a socialist revolution with the help of Judaism, racism and the class struggle. He strcssed that Socialism was inseparably bound to internationalism, as the socialists have no fatherland. The tr ue socialist cannot have anything to do with his nationality. He also declared: this does not apply to Jews! Hess believed that internationalism served the interests of Judaism. He wrote: \"Whoever denies Jewish nationalism is not only an apostate, a renegade in the religious sense, but also a traitor to his people and to his family.\" (Moses Hess, \"Selected Works\", Cologne, 1962.) The Bolshevik Rosa Luxemburg was also simultaneously an in ternationalist and a great Jewish patriot - she even ate exclusively kosher food. In his \"Red Catechism for the German People\", Moses Hess revealed: \"The socialist revolution is my religion.\" He thought it suitable that this brutal struggle for socialist power should be waged under the red family banner of the Rothschilds. Moses Hess wrote to the Jewish socialist leader Ferdinand Lasalle: \"I use the sword against anyone who opposes the struggle of the proletariat.\" (Moses Hess, \"Correspondence\", The Hague, 1959). What he actually meant was the struggle of the Judaists. The radical agitator Hess was not an atheist, however. He wrote: \"I have always been edified by Hebrew pr ayers.\" (Moses Hess, \"Rome and Jerusalem\", 1860.) Hess also explained that Judaism was to pass into a godless socialist, revolutionary ideology. He stressed that the Jews had been given the role 69"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"of changing mankind into a savage animal, as described in his article \"About the Monetary System\". (\"Rheinische Jahrbucher\", Vol. 1, 1845.) Later, Marx and Engels stated quite openly that many of Hess' ideas deserved a wide recognition. The Hungarian Jew Theodor Herzl further developed Hess' Zionist doctrine in the 1890s. Another of Marx's guides, Levi Baruch, emphasised to him that the revolutionary elite of Jews were not to reject Judaism and that they should be called traitors to their own people if they did so. As sham Christians, some Jews had reached the highest positions in the Church and civil town administration in Spain in the 16th century (the Inquisitor Lucero and many others). Baruch propagated the same tactics for \"revolutionary Jews\" - they were to hide their Judaism behind Marxist phrases. When one of Baruch's letters to Marx was published, its contents caused a big scandal, which they wanted to silence at once. This letter explained, among other things, that it would be easy for Jewry to get into power with the help of the proletariat. Thus the new governments were to be led by Jews who would forbid all private property so that all these riches came into Jewish hands, or made the Jews administrators of the fortunes and estates. In this way an old dream which the Talmud speaks of, namely that all the riches of the world would come into the hands of the Jews, was to be fulfilled. In his letter, Baruch also made it clear that the goals of Judaism were power over the whole world, a mingling of the races, abolition of national frontiers, elimination of the royal families and finally the founding of the Zionist world state. (Salluste, \"Les origines secretes du bolchevisme\", Paris, 1930, pp. 33-34.) The Background to Marx's View of Humanity According to Professor Jan Bergman in Sweden, the Cabbalists regard all non-Jews as cattle. The Talmud also states this opinion in several places: \"Only the Jews are called human, the goyim are called animals.\" (Baba Batra 114b, Jebamot 61a, Keritot 6b and 7a.) The lives of non-Jews are worth less than the lives of Jews. This supposition is confirmed in the Talmud: \"If a non-Jew murders a non-Jew or an Israelite, he shall be punished. But if an Israelite murders a non-Jew, the death penalty cannot be imposed.\" (Sanhedrin 57a, which in Epstein's 70"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"English translation corresponds to Sanhedrin I, p. 388.) The Talmud also exhorts: \"Even the best of the goyim (Gentiles) must be killed.\" (Avodah Zara 26b, Tosefoth.) The Jews even believe that the products of the Gentiles' work belong to God's chosen people. \"The property of the Gentiles is like a masterless desert; anyone who takes it has thereby acquired a right to it.\" (Baba Batra 54b.) As can be seen, Judaism is an extremely racist doctrine. This is con- firmed time after time in both the Talmud and Torah. \"Humanity is blessed solely for the sake of the Jews.\" (Talmud, Jebamot 63a.) \"All Jews are born the children of kings.\" (Shabbat 67a.) \"The Jews are more agreeable to God than the angels.\" (Chullin 91b.) The Jewish writer and freemason Heinrich Heine (Chaim Budeburg) has admitted: \"The Jewish religion is not a religion at all, it is a calamity.\" Israel Shahak also believes Cabbalistic mysticism to be deeply misanthropic. (\"Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years\", London, 1994, pp. 16-19.) In Deuteronomy 20:10-17 we are informed that all other nations must work for the Jews if they come into the Jews' dominion. If they resist, they must be killed and their property robbed. All goyim must be exterminated where the Jews already live. In Deuteronomy 7:16 (King James' Bible), one can read the following: \"And thou shalt consume all the people that the LORD thy god shall deliver thee; thi ne eye shall have no pity upon them.\" The Jews have unfortunately followed these incitements to genocide from time to time. The Greek historian Dio Cassius (who was also a Roman official) described in detail how the Jews in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, in the year 116 A.D., during a rebellion began to murder various races they lived among. Judaists killed both women and children, at times using terrible torture. The most infamous bloodbaths were committed in the city of Cyrene and the province Cyrenaica (in the eastern part of present-day Libya) and on Cyprus and above all in its capital Salamis. The Greek historian Eusebius confirmed this. Mass murders were also perpetrated in Mesopotamia and Palestine. In Cyrenaica alone, the Jews killed 220 000 Romans and Greeks. On in Cyprus, their victims were estimated at 240 000. On this island the Jew Artemion led the murders. Understandably, the Jews were no longer welcome on Cyprus after this. 71"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Roman Emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53-117 A.D.) sent troops to stop the killing. It took Rome a year to rein in the bloodlust of the Jews. Dio Cassius tells us how the Jews even ate their victims and smeared themselves with their blood. (William Douglas Morrison, \"The Jews Under Roman Rule\", London and New York, 1890, pp. 191-193.) The most brutal murders were committed in Egypt. Dio Cassius describes how the Jews even attacked the ships in which fear-stricken people tried to escape. (Dr Emil Schurer, \"Geschichte des judischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi\" / \"History of the Jewish people in the time of Christ\", Leipzig, 1890, p. 559.) I shall give some further examples of massacres perpetrated by Judaists. In A.D. 517, Judaists headed by Joseph (Jussuf) Mashrak Dhu Nuwas seized power in the north of Himyar in southern Arabia (now Saudi Arabia) and at once began to destroy the Christians and other Gentiles in the area. This wild slaughter shook all of Europe. Dhu Nuwas had seized power by force and introduced Judaism as the new national religion. Allied troops from Byzantium, Arabia and Aksum (Ethiopia) managed to overthrow Dhu Nuwas in May, A.D. 525. The mass murderer was executed. (Y. Kobistyanov, A. Drizdo, V. Mirimanov, \"The Meeting of Civilisations in Africa\", Tallinn, 1973, pp. 84-85.) But those were not crimes according to the Jews because, as the Talmud tells us: \"Even the best of the goyim must be killed.\" The Jews have themselves written of their massacres in the Bible. In Esther 9:16, we find the story of how the Jews, with Mordocai at their head, murdered 75 000 Persians and members of other nations. The Judaists celebrate this genocide every year in February or March as the feast of Purim. Against the background of these Cabbalistic beliefs we are able to explain Marx's extreme contempt for other races. The Russians were a totally inferior people according to him. He called all the Slavic peoples an \"ethnic sewer\". He also disliked the Chinese. {New York Times, 25th of June 1963.) He rejected everyone who was unwilling to participate in his \"revolutionary\" struggle against God. He called the workers, for whom he had created his ideology, idiots and asses. He called the peasants cave- men. Another reason why Bakunin later distanced himself from Marxism was that it was a further development of Judaism. For Yahweh gave the Jews the right to steal the lands of others (Deuteronomy 6:10-13, 6:18-19, 7:1- 72"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"2). Yahweh gave the Israelites the right to commit genocide, to totally annihilate the peoples whose lands they had the God-given right to take as their own (Deuteronomy 7:16). Yahweh gave the Israelites the right to \"destroy them (other peoples) with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed\" (Deuteronomy 7:23). Yahweh gave the Israelites the right to murder and plunder other races of their property (Exodus 3:20-22). Yahweh has made the Israelites a \"holy\" people, a master race among other races (Deuteronomy 7:6). In his book \"God and the State\", Bakunin declared: \"Of all the good gods who have ever been worshipped by men, Yahweh is the most jealous, the most vain, the cruellest, the most unjust, the blood-thirstiest, the most despotic and the one who is most hostile against human dignity and liberty...\" Incredible Admissions by Marx, Disraeli and Others To maintain the illusion that Judaism had nothing to do with Marxism and that the Mosaic religion actually posed an ideological threat to Marxist Communism, several Communist leaders (among others Marx himself, 73 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Francois Marie Charles Fournier - all Jews) made some so-called critical statements about Jews. Several more recent Communist leaders have also made sure that they were accused of anti-Semitism to divert suspicions from the Frankist- Cabbalist aspect of Communism. Most so-called Sovietologists and researchers (who have no personal experience of Communism) have allowed themselves to be fooled by this pantomime. Even Tommy Hansson, whose sympathies lie with the bourgeoisie, spreads this myth further in his book \"Marxismens ideologi\" / \"The Ideology of Marxism\" (Stockholm, 1989). In 1844 Marx wrote in his article \"On the Jewish Question\", that the Jews more or less controlled Europe, that their worldly god was money and that their most important business was to swindle money from people by means of extortionate interest rates. Marx reasoned: \"Which is the deepest foundation of the Jewish religion? The practical needs, egoism... What is abstract in the Jewish religion? Contempt for theory, art, history, for man as a goal in himself - this has become the money-loving man's true conscious position and virtue... As soon as society has managed to rid itself of the empirical nature of Judaism, bartering and its conditions, the Jew will become unimaginable, because then his conscious-ness no longer has an object...\" He also firmly asserted: \"Behind every tyrant there is always a Jew.\" Marx admitted that the Christian society was being Judaised, so becoming ever more capitalistic and increasingly worshipping money. Every intelligent person knew this. How the Jews took over commerce in Polish Galicia in the 19th century was no secret. Polish businesses were ruined by the amalgamation of Jewish merchants. The competing Jewish businessmen suddenly began to sell their merchandise at much lower prices than the Poles, so that their businesses eventually went bankrupt. Then the Jewish businessmen raised their prices, thereby gaining control over the entire market in Galicia. Centuries before, the Roman writer Tacitus (54-119 A.D.) stated: \"The Jews show only their tribesmen loyalty and mercy.\" The Jewish business- men did not see this ruination of Polish merchants as criminal, because it is written in the Talmud: \"Whatever sins a Jew commits, God still sees him as good and faultless.\" (Chagiga 15b.) Neither was it a crime that Jewish revolutionaries lied to Christians and other easily fooled people. 74"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"According to the Talmud, \"God's name is not profaned if a Jew lies to a Goy.\" (Baba Kamma 113b.) In the middle of the Crimean war, on the 4th of January 1856, Marx arrogantly revealed to the New York Daily Tribune that there was an orga- nisation, which was intriguing in Europe and was the real winner when England, France and Russia became weakened after losses in wars. Other Jews have also been just as open. In his novel \"Coningsby\", Bcnjamin Disraeli described how a secret Jewish organisation ruled the world by means of banks. He showed how easy it was for this organisation to destroy empires and establish others, to overthrow rulers and install new ones in their stead. Disraeli, whose father had immigrated to England from Italy, was well-versed in the secrets of the Frankists and wrote that Germany faces a terrible revolution, which is being prepared with the help of the Jews; at the head of the communists and socialists stand Jews. The purpose was to neutralise the Christians and transform the world into a Jewish world with values built on violence, the basic idea being that problems can only be solved by the use of force. Disraeli stated: \"We create our luck and call it fate.\" It was Disraeli who first officially used the term \"big brother\" (a Masonic term) about a dictator. George Orwell made the idea widely known in his book \"1984\". Disraeli was, as is commonly known, the prime minister of Great Britain in 1868 and in 1874-80. He was later knighted and became Lord Beacons- ficld. Wasn't it strange that Marx was later accused of anti-Semitism but not Disraeli, who described the same phenomenon? Or did it have something to do with the fact that Marx openly became a communist but not Disraeli, who was a conservative? Neither has one of the great English authors, the autodidact Herbert George Wells (1866-1946), been accused of anti-Semitism. In 1939, he published a book with the title \"The Fate of Homo Sapiens\", where he wrote the following concerning the orthodox Jews: \"The whole question turns upon the Chosen People idea, which this remnant cherishes and sustains, which it is the \"mission\" of this remnant to cherish and sustain. It is difficult not to regard that idea as a conspiracy against the rest of the world... Almost every community with which the orthodox Jews have come into contact has sooner or later developed and acted upon that conspiracy idea. A careful reading of the Bible does nothing to correct it; there indeed 75"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"you have the conspiracy plain and clear. It is not simply the defensive conspiracy of a nice harmless people anxious to keep up their dear, quaint old customs, that we are dealing with. It is an aggressive and vindictive conspiracy.\" The Jewish philosopher Erich Fromm also admitted that the revolutio- naries were really criminals. Marx and Engels as Illuminati There are not many today who know that Moses Hess was connected to the Illuminati. It was he who introduced both Marx and Engels to the Illuminati. On 5 July 1843, at the lodge Le Socialiste in Brussels, the Masonic leader Ragon submitted the draft for the revolutionary plan of action, which was later made into \"The Communist Manifesto\". The lodge Le Socialiste sent the proposal to their and Belgium's largest Masonic authority, Supreme Conseil de Belgique, and they unanimously decided to accept Ragon's anarchist program as \"corresponding to the Masonic, doctrine concerning the social question and that the world which is united in Grand Orient should with all conceivable means aim to realise it\". (Bulletin du Grand Orient, June 1843.) On 17 November 1845, Karl Marx became a member of the lodge Le Socialiste. In February 1848, Marx published his \"Communist Manifesto\" on the orders of the Masonic leadership. Marx and Engels were freemasons of the 31st degree. (Vladimir Istarkhov, \"The Battle of the Russian Gods\", Moscow, 2000, p. 154.) In 1847, Marx and Engels became members of The League of Just Men, one of the Illuminati's underground branches where the Jew Jakob Venedey played an important role. This secret organisation was founded in 1836 in Paris by \"revolutionary\" Jewish socialists. On the 12th of May 1839, The League of Just Men, together with another conspiratorial group The Seasons, attempted to seize power in France under the leadership of the Jewish freemasons Joseph Moll, Karl Christian Schapper and the founder of the organisation, the freemason Louis Auguste Blanqui. The attempt failed and Blanqui was imprisoned. The leaders escaped to London, where The 76"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"League of Just Men became an international subversive organisation headed by Joseph Moll and Karl Schapper. Similar coup attempts in Poland and France in 1831 also failed. The financial elite and the Illuminati needed a suitable ideology to camouflage their aspiration to power. They wanted to carry out certain conspiratorial plans and at the same time propagate for atheism. The workers happened to be \"useful idiots\" and could be made excellent blind tools, which they hoped to be able to manipulate most efficiently. To carry on with their conspiracy in the name of the working classes, they had to cultivate and shape all kinds of communist and socialist Utopias. Hess and Marx hoped to exploit the jealousy of the stupid proletariat to enforce a hell on earth where fear, suffering, terror and treason ruled supreme - Communism. This is why Moses Hess suggested transforming The League of Just Men into a communist party in November 1847. Together with Engels, Marx reorganised (Soviet term) the League before the end of the year. Moses Hess, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Wilhelm Weitling, Hermann Kriege, Joseph Weydemeyer, Ernst and Ferdinand Wolf played important roles. Marx was commissioned to write the manifesto of the Communist Party, according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia. It was Moses Hess who made him work out the religion of the socialist revolution. Marx did this with the co-operation of the slave-trader Jean Lafitte-Laflinne. \"The Communist Manifesto\" was published in London. In this document, Marx had only further developed the ideas of the Illuminist leaders Adam Weishaupt and Clinton Roosevelt. He had at the same time uscd the conspiratorial experience of the Utopian communist and Illuminatus Francois Noel Babeuf (1760-1797) to show the way to the socialist (Illuminist) revolution. In this way, Communism and Socialism became the code names for the Illuminati's program, which was to extinguish all moral principles, where- upon everything was allowed. After this, the Illuminati did everything to sprcad the new religion, whose prophet and apostle was to be Karl Marx, who wrote: \"A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism.\" (\"The Communist Manifesto\".) Against the competing religions, Marx raised the slogan \"Religion is the opium of the people!\" He began to wildly propagate the idea that the old 77"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"society could only be ended by \"a single method - with revolutionary terrorism\". (Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, \"Works\", Moscow, Volume 5, p. 494.) In \"The Communist Manifesto\", Marx and Engels openly declared that force must be used to conquer the world: \"The ruling classes shall tremble before the coming Communist Revolution!\" \"We can only reach our goals by violently overthrowing the entire established order.\" In \"Das Kapital\" (1867) Marx also believed it absolutely necessary to stress the need of violence in socialist actions. He wrote: \"Violence is the midwife who helps a new society struggle out from the womb of the old.\" Slogans like \"Workers of the world - unite!\" were needed in order to get the army of the blind to aid the Illuminati into power before they were subdued and finally enslaved - all in the name of \"light-bringing\" Com- munism. The class struggle was to abolish many individual liberties and simplify the extinction of all-profound cultural values and creations. Marx eagerly stressed that Socialism was impossible without revolution. Naturally, these Marxist \"theories\" were full of contradictions. Marx's \"doctrine\" only concerned the way physical work creates values. In contrast, he did not acknowledge creative thought, which could be said to shape the world to an even greater extent. In this way, he demonstrated to anyone with any insight that his theories were only intended to bait the workers and impudently exploit their intellectual immaturity. The intelligent and gifted people who would not be taken in were bound to perish. He exhorted the revolutionaries to be neither generous nor honest and definitely not to shy away from the prospect of civil war. (K. Marx and F. Engels, \"Works\", Moscow, Volume 33, p. 772.) The result was that the Marxists established a new and complete form of propaganda by preaching fair lies to primitive and dissatisfied people. Marx recommended the industrialisation of society so that the masses would find employment. In this way they could be recruited as workers. Whether the products of industry were needed or not was unimportant to the Illuminati, neither did it matter whether the production process harmed the environment. If people were left unem ployed and given time to think, the Illuminati's violent regime might be endangered... 78"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"1848: \"The Year of Revolution\" - The First Wave Only a few months after the founding of the Communist Party, revolutions began to \"break out\" in various countries. 1848 became the great year of revolutions. The Rothschild family was in charge of the financial side and the League of Communists of the planning. The Rothschilds had become enormously wealthy in connection with the French Revolution (1789- 1799) when empires and kingdoms needed to borrow money in amounts previously unparalleled. The Rothschilds had Europe's best information system with their own couriers, who always managed to bring them decisive news (e.g. the outcome of the battle of Waterloo) before the rulers got wind of it, according to Derek Wilson, \"The Rothschild Family\". In 1847, Lionel Rothschild had become the first Jewish Member of the British Parliament. The former Prussian officer August Willich was made the leader of the terrorists. He later became a general for the Union in the American Civil War, where he became infamous for the incredible atrocities he committed. The League of Communists had 400 members by this time, according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia. Forty-odd Scandinavians also took part. \"Revolutions\" were started in half of Europe, mostly by Jewish Illuminati or by their henchmen. It all began when an invisible hand utilised the occasion of the poor crop harvest in 1846. Grain was suddenly bought up in large amounts. During the years 1847-1848, the prices were doubled and tripled as foodstuffs were sent out from secret storehouses. People starved and eventually the time was ripe for bloody revolts. The buyer of all the grain was the Jewish businessman Ephrasi who acted as a front for James Rothschild. A Masonic conference was organised in Strasbourg, Alsace, in May of 1847, where the decision was made to stage the revolution in the spring of 1848. Among the delegates were important Jewish Illuminati and free- masons such as Alphonse Lamartine (1790-1869), who were intended to take command of the new temporary revolutionary government in France (he was officially foreign minister), Adolphe (Isaac Morse) Cremieux, the banker Michel Goudchaux (1797-1862), Leon Gambetta, Simon and Louis Blanc from France (all became famous leaders of the revolution in Paris in the spring of 1848), Joseph Fickler, Friedrich Franz Karl Hecker (1811- 79"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"1881), Georg Herwegh, Robert Blum, Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872) and Johann Jacoby (1805-1877) from Germany (all played leading roles in the \"revolution\"). The Jewish banker and freemason Ludwig Bamberger (1823-1899) led the \"revolution\" in Germany in 1848. He founded Central Bank of Ger- many in 1870. Adolphe Cremieux served as minister of justice in the revolutionary government. It was Cremieux who, in May 1860, together with Rabbi Elie-Aristide Astruc, Narcisse Leven, Jules Garvallo and others in Paris founded the great Jewish Masonic Lodge L'Alliance Israelite Universelle, which used the B'nai B'rith as it s executive organ. In 1863, Cremieux became president of the central committee of the movement. The motto of this organisation was: \"All Israelites are comrades!\" Adolph Isaac Cremieux, who was a well-known lawyer, \"liberal\" poli- tician and a Grand Master of the Ordre du rite Memphis-Misraim and Master of the Grand Orient de France, spoke openly in his manifesto to Alliance Israelite Universelle: \"The union which we shall create will not be a French, English, Irish or German, but a Jewish World Union... Under no circumstances shall a Jew befriend a Christian or a Muslim; not before the moment comes when Judaism, the only true religion, shines over the entire World.\" Cremieux (33°) also worked closely with the powerful English Jew Chaim Montefiore (1784-1885). Together they saved two Jewish ritual murderers who had admitted to their crimes in Damascus. Sicily came first. On the 12th of January 1848, the \"revolutionaries\" in Palermo simply declared Sicily independent. On the 8th of February the revolutionary movement was organised in Piedmont. The revolt began in Tuscany on the 17th of February. Everything was co-ordinated by two Jewish Illuminati leaders, Giuseppe Mazzini and Adriano Lemmi. Lemmi was a skilful revolutionary conspirator who became a Grand Master of the Grande Oriente d'ltalia in 1885. The freemason and Grand Master Giuseppe Garibaldi (33°) also took part in the planning. Afterwards, they began to act in France. A revolt was stirred up in Paris on the 22nd-23rd of February. Isaac Cremieux made sure that Louis Philippe was dethroned and he fled to London on the 24th of February. Lamartine seized power. On the very same day, the 24th February, \"The Communist Manifesto\" was published. Riots also occurred elsewhere. 80"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" March 1848 - The Prepared Plan If we take a closer look at the points in time when \"revolutions\" broke out in several places in March of 1848, we see a clear connection, which reveals a prepared plan behind the events. On the 5th of March, the so-called pre-Parliament held a meeting in Heidelberg, led by the Grand Master of the local Masonic lodge and attended mainly by Jews who also took part in the Illuminati conference in Strasbourg. On March 11th, the Illuminati founded the Council of Saint Wenceslas - Vaclav - in Prague. The violent incidents in this series of events began on March 13th with the rebellion in the Austrian capital, Vienna. The architects behind the action were two Jewish doctors, Adolf Fischhof and Joseph Goldmark. On March 14th a \"revolution\" occurred in Rome. The leader here was Giu- seppe Mazzini, who declared the Papal States a republic. This republic was later crushed, despite Garibaldi's stubborn defence. A revolt in Hungarian Pest had been planned well in advance for the 15th of March. The leaders of the Hungarian revolt were the Jew Mahmud Pascha (Freund), who organised the coup in Budapest, and the freemason Lajos Kossuth, who acted in the provinces. The intention was to celebrate the murder of the Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar on the same day in 44 B.C. The Masonic lodge, the Grand Orient still praises Brutus for this murder. Riots in Naples and Paris had been planned for the same day. 81"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The 18th of March became a special day. Then the dark powers agitated for rebellions in Milan and Stockholm and for a revolution in Berlin. The revolution in Berlin was led exclusively by Jewish free- masons. The actions on this Saturday were even planned to take place at the same time in Milan, Berlin and Stockholm. The 18th of March was an important day for the Jewish freemasons. The Jewish Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, had been burned at the stake in Paris on this same day in 1314. These revolts were intended as a revenge both for his execution and for the abolition of the Knights Templar two years earlier, all of which was done by the orders of Philip the Fair (1268-1314). These plans of revenge involved the murder of the Prussian King Wilhelm IV (1795-1861) in Berlin, following which the Illuminatus Mikhail Bakunin was to become the dictator of Prussia. But the plans were foiled when a faithful subject warned his king. He was, however, forced to capitulate and make great concessions. Johann Jacoby led the revolt. These plans of revenge were put into action again 23 years later - on the 18th of March 1871 - when the Paris commune was proclaimed. Later, in the Soviet Union, this day was celebrated as the day of the Red Aid. The troubles reached Stockholm too, far faster than a galloping horse (the fastest means of communication at that time). Those riots were the bloodiest, most violent events in the history of the city. Bunny Ragnerstam states in his book \"Arbetare i rorelse\" / \"Workers in Action\" (Stockholm, 1986) that 18 people were killed during the troubles. The instigators were the Communist Association in Stockholm, founded in the autumn of 1847. This organisation had connections with the European Communist League. The power behind the operation was the Jewish writer Christoffer Kahnberg, who also wrote the proclamations, which were posted all over the city: \"Destroy the nobility and give the bourgeois and the workers their rights!\" \"The hour of revolution has struck!\" \"Down with the govern- ment!\" (At this time, Sweden had a liberal king, Oscar I.) \"Long live liber- ty, equality, fraternity!\" \"Long live the people! Long live the Republic!\" On March 17th, the revolt against the Austrians in Venice was organised. On the same day, the \"revolutionaries\" freed Daniele Manin (1804-1857), a Jewish freemason and Giuseppe Mazzini's agent. On the 18th of March, he led the attempt to take over power. After defeating the Austrians on the 22nd of March, Manin proclaimed Venice a republic, the leadership of which consisted of freemasons, among whom were two 82"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Jewish \"revolutionaries\": Leon Pincherle and Isaac Pesaro Maurogonato. The fact that these two were Jews is verified in the Encyclopaedia Judaica. According to Mazzini's program (1848), Austria-Hungary had to cease to exist as a state. The European revolution was therefore to begin in Italy, eventually to lead to the forming of the United States of Europe. The lawyer Daniele Manin, who came from the well-known Jewish Medina family, was named \"president\" (dictator in fact) of the Republic of Venice in August 1848. The Austrians eventually managed to crush this republic on the 22nd of August 1849 and Manin fled together with other Jewish Illuminist and Masonic conspirators to Paris, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Judisches Lexikon (Berlin, 1929, Vol. 3, p. 1363) also confirms that Daniele Manin was a Jew. During the March revolution in Munich, the freemasons forced the Bavarian King Ludwig I to abdicate. On the 21st of March, the \"revo- lution\" began in Schleswig after the Danes had marched in. In our history books, those actions were supposedly \"spontaneous\" on the part of the people. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Second Wave, 1848-49 On the 12th of April, the Jew Friedrich Hecker organised a riot in Baden. On the 15th of May the freemasons began the second rebellion in Vienna, after which they forced the emperor to abdicate. The \"revolution\" in Bohemia (now Czechia) culminated with the re- bellion in Prague on the 12th of June 1848. This was put down almost immediately, on June 17th. According to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclo- paedia, this action was organised in Prague by the Illuminatus Mikhail Bakunin, as was the \"revolt\" in Dresden on the 3rd of May 1849, which was also quickly dealt with, after which Bakunin fled from the city on May 9th. He had been a member of the temporary revolutionary govern- ment in Dresden. He was later sentenced to death and extradited to Russia. In 1861, he escaped from Siberia to Japan and eventually came back to Europe. On the 22nd of June 1848, a new riot was instigated in Paris. On the 18th of September, the rebellion in Frankfurt was organised. On the 6th of October, a third attempt at \"revolution\" was made in Vienna. Adolf Fisch- hof took the post of chief of the security committee. He became a real dictator of Austria. The \"revolution\" there was fortunately crushed on the 31 st of October. On the 5th of November, the rebellion began anew in Rome. All of this was repeated in many places around Europe. In Italy, the revolutionary republic was liquidated in the autumn of 1849. A people's militia was also organised during this wave of revolutions. Behind those actions around Europe (in Austria, Italy, France, Hungary, Bohemia, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden) in 1848, was a Masonic conspiracy, according to Nesta Webster (\"World Revolution\", London, 1921, p. 156). Marx and Engels went to Cologne in April 1848, where they founded a communist newspaper, Neue Rheinische Zeitung, the first issue of which came out on the 1st of June. Its purpose was to spread propaganda. The founder of the Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, had declared: \"It is necessary to make our principles modern, then young writers will be able to spread them in society and thereby serve our purpose.\" He stressed that the journalists must be influenced so that they harboured no doubts about the Illuminist writers. This was Marx's job. 84"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Evcntually the \"revolution\" in Ge rmany was completely put down and Marx was exiled in May 1849. Before this, he managed to write in his newspaper: \"We are merciless and do not demand any clemency. When it is our turn, we will not hide our terrorism.\" (\"Karl Marx: Eine Psycho- graphie\" by Arnold Kunzli, Vienna, 1966.) Disraeli revealed how the Illuminati, led by the Jews, were behind the troubles in Europe in the spring of 1848: \"When the secret societies, in February 1848, surprised Europe, they were themselves surprised by the unexpected opportunity, and so little capable were they of seizing the occasion, that had it not been for the Jews, who of late years unfortunately have been connecting themselves with these unhallowed associations, im- becile as were the governments, the uncalled for outbreak would not have ravaged Europe.\" (Benjamin Disraeli, \"Lord George Bentinck: a Political Biography\", London, 1882, p. 357.) Also this quote shows how carefully the Illuminati had planned this wave of destruction, which once more came to a head with the terror in Poland in 1863... The Illuminist Terror Continues... The International Working Men's Association was founded in London on the 28th of September 1864 and following this, Hess, Marx, Engels and Bakunin founded the First International which continued the activity of the Communist League. The Communist League had officially ceased to exist on the 17th of November 1852. The Jewish terrorist Karl Cohen, a member of the First International and an associate of Marx, attempted to murder Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck on Unter den Linden in Berlin on May 7th, 1866. The Marxists also later continued their terrorist actions. Maxim Kowalevski was present when Marx was informed about the failed attempt to murder Kaiser Wilhelm I in 1878, this time also on Unter den Linden. He claimed that Marx became infuriated and hurled anathemas at the terrorist who had failed in his terrorism. (Paul Johnson, \"The Intellectuals\", Stockholm, 1989, p. 93.) On March 18th, 1871, the Marxists succeeded in introducing the world's first \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\" in Paris. Most of the leading 85"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"members of \"the revolutionary Paris Commune\" (the term originates from 1792) were also members of the First International. This commune was the first warning signal to civilisation that the dark Illuminati forces wanted to destroy it. The Communards were mostly freemasons (Louis Charles Delescluze, Gustave Fluorens, Edouard Vaillant), who also actively fought against Christianity. The Paris Commune was successfully liquidated 71 days later - on the 28th of May 1871. The terror of the evil Jacobins and Blankists claimed 20 000 human lives. After all, Weishaupt had explained to his disciples: \"You must stifle anyone you cannot persuade!\" This setback did not stop the Illuminati. In 1872, Karl Marx decided to shut down the International in Europe; the organisation was breaking up under the strain of the power struggle between himself and the leader of the anarchists, Mikhail Bakunin. Four years later, on the 15th of July 1876 (100 years after the creation of the Illuminati Order), the International also ceased in Philadelphia, U.S.A. The First International, which worked for the Illuminati, engaged Eugene Pottier (1816-1887) to write an anthem for the \"workers' struggle\". This gruesome song became the national \"anthem\" of the Soviet Union in 1917 and remained so until 1944, when it became the hymn of the Communist Party. Eugene Pottier was later one of the leaders of the Paris Commune. From 1890, the 1st of May, the date when the Illuminati were founded, is also the date when communists and socialists across the world celebrate under Rothschild's red flag, which symbolises the permanent revolution, according to Moses Hess. Naturally, it was desirable to find a more \"prole- tarian\" reason to celebrate the founding day. This was why a provocation was arranged in Chicago in 1886, for the Illuminati's 110th birthday. It was hoped that a serious conflict with the police would take place so that there would be a few martyrs whose memory they could celebrate. The attempt failed, however. Only on the 3rd of May did the police open fire on a group of workers attacking some strike-breakers. One worker was killed immediately and another three died later in hospital. They had their martyrs, but it was on the wrong day! The instigator was a Jewish Illuminatus and millionaire, Samuel Gom- pers, who had immigrated from England and become the chairman of the 86"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Federation of Trade Unions. Gompers propagated Marx's ideas. (Afton- bladet, 26th June 1986.) At a workers' demonstration on the 4th of May 1886, an Illuminist provocateur threw a bomb at the police present at the meeting. Five policemen were killed. The police opened fire at the demonstrators, of which a few were killed and many wounded. The Second International in Paris similarly decided to make May 1st a red-letter day in 1889. The real reason for this decision was obviously one that was better hidden from the masses of non-Illuminati. According to the British historian Nesta H. Webster, the Illuminati also had full control of the activities of the Second International (1889-1899). Karl Marx died in exile in London on the 14th of March 1883. All sorts of fair myths were created around his name. In this way he became the patron saint of evil. After the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, it has often been claimed that not all the evils, which came with Marxism, were intentional. This was certainly the way Marx had intended his \"teachings\" to work. The Illuminati Marx and Engels were successful enough to fool entire nations and their demoniac manifesto was to become a cruel reality for millions of unfortunate people. The Truth behind the Myths There are many myths about Marx: that he was poor and supported only by Engels, that he was against terrorism, very tolerant, and had no wish to destroy the ideas of others. What was he really like? According to the most famous myth, Marx had no money and was eco- nomically dependent on his \"friend\" Engels. In reality, Nathan Rothschild financed him. This was revealed by his close associate Mikhail Bakunin in his \"Polemique contre les Juifs\" (\"Polemic Against the Jews\"). Bakunin broke away from Marx and his companions, because \"they had one foot in the bank and the other foot in the socialist movement\". The Frankist Illuminati's central slogan was: \"No wall is so high that a donkey loaded with gold cannot get over it.\" Later, Engels characterised Marx as a monster who was livid with hatred \"as if ten thousand devils had caught him by the hair\". Marx's 87"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"uncontrolled drinking and his wild, expensive orgies only increased his fury at his environment. All the meetings in Paris had to be held behind closed doors and windows, so that Marx's roaring was not heard out in the street. Karl Marx had a great craving for the finest foods, and French wine, among other things, was imported for his family's meals. His family had a weakness for expensive habits. A famous Jewish socialist, freemason, Illuminatus and comrade of Marx, Giuseppe Mazzini, who had known Marx well, wrote this about him: \"His heart bursts rather with hatred than with love towards men.\" Karl Marx was \"a destructive spirit\". (Fritz Joachim Raddatz, \"Karl Marx: Eine Politische Biographie\", Hamburg, 1975.) Marx was an unreliable egoist and a lying intriguer who only wished to exploit others, according to his assistant, Karl Heinzen. (Karl Heinzen, \"Erlebtes\", Boston, 1864.) Heinzen also thought that Marx had small, nasty eyes \"which spat flames of evil fire\". He had a habit of warning: \"I will annihilate you!\" Marx was not interested in democracy. The editorial staff of Neue Rheinische Zeitung was, according to Engels, organised so that Marx became its dictator. He could not take criticism. He always became infuriated if anyone tried to criticise him. In 1874, when Dr Ludwig Kugelmann merely hinted that if Marx would organise his life a little better he might finish \"Das Kapital\", Marx would have nothing more to do with Kugelmann and slandered him ruthlessly. When Bakunin accused Marx of seeking to completely centralise power, Marx called him a theoretical nobody. Karl Marx condemned exploitation of people. He himself exploited everyone near him. He fought all those he could not subdue. Even as a child, he had been a real tyrant. To work was what Marx wanted least of all. He speculated heavily on the stock market, however, constantly losing huge amounts of money. Neither did he show any consideration for the work of others. Many craftsmen he hired had to wait a long time for their pay. His housekeeper, Helen Demuth, worked like a slave in his household for 40 years without any cash pay whatsoever. It does not seem so strange then, that Marx supported slavery in the United States of America. Like his brother Illuminatus Albert Pike, he vented his racist opinions against blacks."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"In further reference to Marx's housekeeper Helen Demuth, it can be said that on June 23, 1851, she gave birth to a baby boy whose father's name was Karl Marx. The father wanted to know nothing about Henry Frederick Demuth, however, so the boy was given up to a fosterhome. The case of the disowned son later became an embarrassment for the Bolshevik leaders in Moscow, so Joseph Stalin classified as secret those letters between Marx and Engels, where this affair is too apparent. {Viikkolehti, 11th of January 1992.) Marx collected information about his political rivals and opponents. He delivered the notes he made to the police, believing it to be of advantage to him. Paul Johnson states this. Marx preached about a better society but did not care about any morals. Neither did he care about cleanliness. This had a bad effect on both his health and his contacts with other revolutionaries. He suffered from boils for 25 years. In 1873 these boils caused him a nervous breakdown leading to tremors and violent fits of rage. He never ate fruit or vegetables. Marx as a Publicist As a publicist, Marx \"borrowed\" all of his slogans. It was Jean-Paul Marat who formulated the phrases \"Workers have no fatherland!\" and \"The proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains!\" He took the slogan \"Religion is the opium of the people!\" from the Jewish writer Heinrich Heine. Karl Schapper originally came up with \"Workers of the world, unite!\" Neither was the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" one of Marx's ideas - Louis Blanqui was author of it. In 1841, the Jewish Illuminatus Clinton Roosevelt published his book \"The Science of Government, Founded on Natural Law\", in which he based his doctrines on Weishaupt's teachings. Six years later, Marx used Roosevelt's principles to write his Communist Manifesto. In this cunning work, he made propaganda for these Illuminist plans: the abolishment of private property, family, nationalism and patriotism, the right of in- heritance, religion and all morals. Marx and Engels state indirectly that a world government must be introduced for the sake of the workers. The holy book of the socialists, \"Das Kapital\", published on September 2, 1867, is especially revealing since this work shows not only that the 89"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"author was a careless and incompetent theorist, but also that he was a downright liar. Paul Johnson demonstr ates this in his book \"The Intel- lectuals\". In 1867, \"Das Kapital\" sold only 200 copies in all Germany. Thus Marx wrote about the situation of the weavers in Silesia without having spoken to any of them. He wrote about industry without having visited a single factory in his life. Marx even refused Engels' offer to visit a cotton factory. Marx met some workers for the first time in 1845 in London and at the German Workers' Educational Association. These were mostly cultivated, self-taught workers and craftsmen who disliked Marx's violent opinions. They would have preferred to see t heir situation improved gradually by way of reforms and social development. Marx felt contempt for them and wanted the intellectuals of the middle classes as support for his apo- calyptic ideas about the destruction of capitalist society. Marx later did all in his power to keep socialist workers out of influential positions in the International. For the sake of appearances only, a few were allowed to remain on various committees. Marx's most violent conflict occurred when he met the labour leader William Weitling in 1846. Marx accused Weitling of having no doctrine. According to Marx, one could not act in the best interests of the workers without a doctrine. Only the first part of \"Das Kapital\" was written by Marx. Engels wrote the rest under instructions from Marx. Only the eighth chapter of part one, \"The Working Day\", deals with the situation of the workers. \"Das Kapital\" is in no way a scientific analysis, since Marx presented only facts, that supported his theories. The material was not only a biased selection, it had also been falsified and distorted to suit Marx's opinions. He used only one single source to claim his theory, Engels' \"Die Lage der arbeitenden Klassen in England\" / \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\", published in Leipzig in 1845. Engels, the son of a cotton producer, knew only about the German textile industry and nothing of note about this industry in other countries. His knowledge of the situation of miners and agricultural labourers was negligible, yet he wrote about the mining and agricultural proletariat. Two careful researchers, William O. Henderson and William H. Chalo- ner, made a new translation of Engels' book in 1958, editing it and checking his sources and the original texts for all his quotations. Their 90"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"analysis virtually annihilated the objective historical value of the work and showed it for what it really was: political propaganda. Engels made a selection suitable for his work from obsolete facts from the years 1801- 1818, never indicating that this was the case. There were also falsi- fications and misquotations amounting to a total of 23 pages (over 5 per cent of the book's 354 pages). Henderson and Chaloner demonstrated with their analysis that Engels had not been honest in his researching. So Marx used a work of that calibre as the only source of his statements and conclusions. He was fully aware of the falsifications, since the German economist Bruno Hildebrand had already revealed most of them in 1948, and Marx had been informed of the criticism. Marx used misquotations himself. He misquoted William Gladstone and the economist Adam Smith. He even misquoted official reports. The two researchers from Cambridge showed in their examination \"Comments on the Use of the Blue Books by Karl Marx in Chapter XV of \"Das Kapital\" (1985), that Marx had not only been careless but had intentionally falsified Paul Johnson came to the same conclusion: that one must be sceptical about all of Marx's texts and that one could never rely on his assertions. For example, Marx claimed that railway accidents had become more frequent whereas the case was exactly the opposite. The Moral Bankruptcy of Marxism According to blind Marxists, of whom there are plenty in Sweden, Marx stood for humanism and human values, liberty and belief in mankind. They probably have not read the following lines about Marx by Friedrich Engels: \"Who is chasing with wild endeavour? A black man from Trier, a remarkable monster. He does not walk or run, he jumps on his heels and rages full of anger...\" (Marx and Engels, \"Selected Works\" in German, supplementary tome II, p. 301.) The exiled Estonian non-socialist writer Arvo Magi stated in a radio programme that Marx was not a terrorist who wished to destroy the ideas of others. But he was! Marx tolerated no ideas but the Illuminist ones which were later known as Marxist. Marxism merely gave the dark Illuminist powers a hypocritical method and a verbose phraseology, which 91"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"they could use to justify any kind of enormity they committed. Since this doctrine was unscientific, they would never in all their attempts be able to put the Marxist theories into practice. What the Marxist regimes really wanted was to treat their subjects with such violence that they eventually lost all feelings of mercy and humanity towards their fellows. The Marxists also took all the proceeds of workers' produce by paying them too little or nothing at all for their work. In this way the Marxists developed modern slavery. Shall we ever be able to understand the extent of crimes of the Marxists against the natural order? Everywhere, where these bandits have come into power, it has led to the advance of state criminalism and gangsterism. It would be futile to hope for anything else. Those dictators forced their slaves to act against nature, and the slaves answered with lies, t heft, cruelty, hypocrisy and laziness. Certain judges of Marxism try to claim that those who can interpret the doctrine correctly have not yet reached power. How is it that only Marxists who interpreted the doctrine wrongly came into power? And what kind of hell can we expect when the \"true interpreters\" of this doctrine eventually reach power? Marxism became what it had to become. Nothing else could be expected from such a brutal, primitive doctrine, which leads straight into the arms of demonic forces. According to Buddhism, what matters is the good path, not the good goal. What you do is of importance, not what you say. If you walk the evil path, as do the Illuminati, you will never reach the good goal. If you walk the good path, you will finally reach the good goal. This is why there is no such thing as good violence. You cannot build anything on evil. It is like building upon the sand. Those who try are deceiving themselves. Neither is it possible to reform an absurd religion, a truth emphasised by the Italian philosopher Filippo Giordano Bruno four hundred years ago. I believe that an attempt to do so is an unpardonable crime. Fanatical Marxists believed that something could be built on an ideology composed entirely of lies. It is just as impossible to have the state control all that happens within a society. Most of those who later became subjects of the Marxist states also knew that the introduction of Marx's ism was a terrible crime against humanity. Few people know, however, how all this happened and why. For, as the former President of Columbia University in New York, Nicolas Butler, 92"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"pointed out: \"The world consists of three types of people. First, the smallest group - those who put plans into action. Then the second, slightly larger group, who see what is happening. Last, the great majority who never knew what happened.\" After the collapse of the Marxist regimes in Eastern Europe, some start- ling facts about the hidden history of Communism have been unearthed. Most of these facts have never been presented to the Western European or American public. There is simply no wish in Europe or America to throw out the remaining myths about Marxism. In some countries, however, the epoch of Marxist lies has come to an end. Professor Albert Meinhold at the University of Jena (formerly in East Germany) symbolically threw out a sculpture of Marx from one of the corridors of the university. In justifying his action, Meinhold said that, although Marx had been conferred the degree of Doctor of Law at the university (in his absence), a large part of humanity had suffered from such terrible evils in the name of Marx and Marxism that his memory was therefore nothing to honour (Svenska Dagbladet, January 28, 1992). Marx was, in other words, thrown into the dustbin! 93"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE UNKNOWN VLADIMIR ULYANOV We have all been led to believe that Vladimir Ulyanov was born in Simbirsk on the 22nd of April 1870. According to the latest enquiries, however, his date of birth had been changed to that date. (Akim Arutiunov, \"The phenomenon Vladimir Ulyanov/Lenin\", Moscow, 1992, p. 126.) An investigation is currently under way to find out when the man was really born. Stalin copied his great teacher and, like him, changed his date of birth. Officially, he was born on the 21st of December 1879, but he was actually born on the 6th of December 1878. The newspaper Izvestiya revealed this state secret on the 26th of June 1990. Both Lenin and Stalin wished to prevent their true natures being revealed by the aid of horoscopes. Napoleon also falsified his date of birth for astrological reasons. It was not suitable for a French emperor to be an Aquarian, so he changed the date to the 15th of August (1769), in order to officially become a Leo. It is generally known that Lenin's o fficial biography has been falsified throughout. Despite this, a decision was made to publish a still more effective version of the myth. So the libraries were purged of all the Lenin biographies printed before 1970. Who was Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin really? The history of Russia is written by its murderers, a fact which the director Stanislav Govorukhin stresses in his documentary \"The Russia We Lost\" (1992). A heavily censored version of this film was shown in Sweden. Lenin's Kalmuck father, Ilya Ulyanov, was a school inspector. Both of his grandfathers ended up in mental institutions. Lenin's mother Maria (maiden name Blank) was of a noble family and daughter of a rich landowner. Maria Blank's father, Israel, was born in 1802 in Staro- konstantinovo in the province of Volynia. In 1820 Israel Blank planned to study at the Medical Academy of St. Petersburg together with his brother Abel, but state universities were 94"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"closed to Jews so both Israel and Abel were baptised into the Russian Orthodox Church. Israel was given the new name of Alexander, his brother Abel became Dmitri. Alexande r's patronymic also became Dmitri (it was actually Moses). In this way, they were both allowed to enter the Medical Academy. The Blank brothers graduated in 1824. Alexander Blank became a military staff doctor and a pioneer of balneology (the study of healthy baths) in Russia. The writer Marietta Shaginyan, who in the 1930s learned about Lenin's Jewish roots, was warned not to make this information public, for it was a state secret. (The periodical Literator, No. 38, 12th of September 1990, St. Petersburg.) It was possible to publish these facts only in 1990. Until then the Blank family had been presented as \"Germans\". Lenin's mother spoke Yiddish, German and also Swedish, the latter of which she taught her daughter Olga, who intended to study at the University of Helsinki. Maria Blank's maternal grandmother was called Anna Beata Ostedt, born in St. Petersburg in a family of goldsmiths who had immigrated from Uppsala (Sweden). Maria Blank's maternal grand- father, the notary Johann-Gottlieb Grosschopf, came from a family of merchants in Germany. Maria Blank's paternal grandparents were Jews. Lenin's paternal grandfather was a Chuvashian and his paternal grand- mother, Anna Smirnova, was a Kalmuck. This made Maria Blank at least half Jewish, for only her father was a full Jew. Hans W. Levy, chairman of the Jewish community of Gothen- burg, has declared: \"Everyone who was born of a Jewish mother is a Jew.\" (Svenska Dagbladet, 22nd of July, 1990.) Some researchers, however, have intimated that also the Grosschopf family was Jewish. If so, Lenin must be regarded as a Jew, for then his mother was a Jewess. In Russia, it was revealed that Lenin's paternal grandfather Nikolai Ulyanov (Kalmuck) had four children with his own daughter Alexandra Ulyanova (who was disguised as Anna Smirnova before the authorities). Lenin's father Ilya was born as the fourth child when Nikolai Ulyanov was 67 years old. (Vladimir Istarkhov, \"The Battle of the Russian Gods\", Moscow, 2000, p. 37.) Ilya Ulyanov married the Jewess Maria Blank, whose paternal grandfather Moisya Blank had been prosecuted for several crimes, including fraud and extortion. Inbreeding probably played a big role in making Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin so perverted: his extreme aggressiveness was hereditary and he was born with substantial brain 95"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"damage, he had several nervous breakdowns, three strokes and was bisexual. He was also a psychopath. German was spoken in the family, a language Vladimir Ulyanov knew better than Russian. In every questionnaire, Lenin wrote that he was a writer, yet his Russian vocabulary was very limited and in his pro- nunciation he stressed words inaccurately. He had very little knowledge of Russian literature, but enough to harbour an intense dislike of Fiodor Dostoyevsky's works. It was characteristic of Lenin that he gave different information about the year of his entrance into the Party in different Party documents. In the first questionnaires, he claimed to have joined in 1893, but on the 7th of March 1921, at the Tenth Party Congress, he stated in the delegate's questionnaire that he had become a Party member in 1894. (Akim Arutiunov, \"The Phenomenon Vladimir Ulyanov/Lenin\", Moscow, 1992, p. 116.) In one of his writings, comrade Ulyanov claimed to have joined the Party in 1895 (\"Collected Works\", Vol. 44, p. 284). How could he be a member of a party, which did not even exist? The Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party was founded only in March 1898. It seems that anything was possible for Lenin. According to the official myth, Lenin had been expelled from the university, but the special archives of the Central Committee state clearly that Vladimir Ulyanov himself asked the Principal of the University of Kazan for permission to leave his studies in 1887. According to the Bolshevik myth, he was expelled to the village of Kokushkino in the province of Kazan for taking part in student revolution- ary activities. Actually, he went to live on his maternal grandfather's estate in Kokushkino after leaving university, an estate which the Tsar had given Alexander Blank. Lenin's grandfather Blank owned the whole village. Later, Lenin lived with his aunt in Kazan, a fact which Lenin himself has written about. Lenin's grandfather also owned another estate (98 hectares) in the village of Alakayevka near Samara. There is nothing left of the real facts in Lenin's official biography. This can be ascertained by studying former ly secret documents, which have recently been released. The kind-hearted people fell for the myths about Lenin. Marie Laidoner, the widow of Estonia's former Commander-in-Chief Johan Laidoner, wrote in her memoirs that if Lenin had lived in 1940, the 96"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Estonians would not have been treated so inhumanely. According to the central myth, the terror and oppression were started only in the 1930s by Stalin, This was also claimed by an editorial in the Aftonbladet on the 6th of June 1989. The Soviet propaganda mythology claim ed that his parents consciously educated Lenin to be a Messiah who would lead the proletariat from their captivity in Egypt, as Karl Radek (actually Tobiach Sobelsohn) wrote in Izvestiya in the spring of 1933. Lenin's mother actually wanted him to be a landowner. The Leninist propaganda had a massive effect on Homo Sovieticus. In an opinion poll in December 1989, 70 per cent of those asked (2700 took part) believed Lenin to be the greatest personality in history. (Paevaleht, January 4, 1991.) Another opinion poll was held in January 1991 where only 10.3 per cent of those asked thought Lenin was a negative person, whilst over half of them believed the October Coup to have been a historical mistake. This is why nothing upsets orthodox communists so much as revelations about Lenin. They refuse to abandon their icon-like picture of Lenin, since Christianity was replaced with Leninism as early as in the 1920s when the whole doctrine was canonised. In the beginning, the sailors called Lenin \"Little Father\". Lenin used all sorts of tried and tested idiocies. One example: \"Work books\" of the kind used with natives in the colonies were used from June 1919. Lenin had few ideas of his own. Even the idea of the land decree was an inheritance from the left-wing Social Revolutionaries. Among his own stupidities were the so-called April Theses which do not correspond with reality since economic independence is impossible without political freedom. At least Vladimir Ulyanov understood that Marxism lacked all scien- tific value. He had whispered to the Jewish businessman Armand Hammer: \"Armand, Armand - Socialism is never going to work!\" (SvenskaDagbladet, August 30, 1987.) According to Engels, Marx had transformed Utopian Socialism into a scientific doctrine by \"discovering\" the materialist (i.e. atheist) worldview (this is how Engels is interpreted in the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia). As an enlightened Marxist, Lenin knew of Marx's instructions, according 97"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"to which the revolutionaries were supposed to be neither \"generous\" nor \"honest\". There was no need to be fussy about the aims in order to reach their goals. Nor was there any need to worry about the danger of civil war. (Marx and Engels, \"Works\", Moscow, Vol. 33, p. 172.) Adam Weishaupt had written that all means were permissible in order to reach the final goal. Lenin repeated that all means were justifiable when the goal was the victory of Communism. Lenin's goal was to damage Russia and, if possible, gain power and become rich. He was prepared to work with any forces in order to damage Russia, even with the authorities in Imperial Germany, according to facts that became known later. Lenin was unable to arouse any interest among naive people for the \"revolutionary activities\" of a simply Marxist club - most joined as cold-blooded conspirators and adventurers. In 1919 the confidant Lenin said in: \"What is Soviet Power?\" (con- tained on one of his phonograph records) that Soviet power was inevitable and was victorious everywhere in the world. \"This power is invincible, since it is the only right one,\" Lenin finished in his burring un-Russian accent. Lenin as a Freemason Whether Lenin was a freemason as early as in the 1890s is not yet possible to determine but he worked in the same way as subversive groups usually do. The Illuminati, the Grand Orient, B'nai B'rith (Sons of the Covenant), and other Masonic lodges were all interested in agitating the workers towards certain \"useful\" goals. It is important to stress that Lenin and his henchmen did not work. They could still afford to travel around Europe (then relatively more expensive than now) and live in luxury. These professional revolutionaries had only one task- to agitate the workers. Lenin's later activity shows clearly how he followed Adam Weishaupt's line. Several sources reveal that Lenin became a freemason whilst abroad (in 1908). One of these sources is a thorough investigation: Nikolai Svitkov's \"About Freemasonry in Russian Exile\", published in Paris in 1932. According to Svitkov, the most important freemasons from Russia were 98"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin, Leon Trotsky (Leiba Bronstein), Grigori Zinoviev (Gerson Radomyslsky), Leon Kamenev (actually Leiba Rosen- feld), Karl Radek (Tobiach Sobelsohn), Maxim Litvinov (Meyer Hennokh Wallakh), Yakov Sverdlov (Yankel-Aaron Solomon), L. Martov (Yuli Zederbaum), and Maxim Gorky (Alexei Peshkov), among others. According to the Austrian political scientist Karl Steinhauser's \"EG - die Super-UdSSR von morgen\" / \"EU the New Super USSR\" (Vienna, 1992, p. 192), Lenin belonged to the Masonic lodge Art et Travail (Art and Work). The famous British politician Winston Churchill also confirmed that Lenin and Trotsky belonged to the circle of the Masonic and Illuminist conspirators {Illustrated Sunday Herald, February 8th, 1920). Lenin, Zinoviev, Radek and Sverdlov also belonged to B'nai B'rith. Researchers who are specialised on the activities of B'nai B'rith, including Schwartz-Bostunich, confirmed this information. (Viktor Ostretsov, \"Freemasonry, Culture and Russian History\", Moscow, 1999, pp, 582-583.) Lenin was a freemason of the 31st degree (Grand Inspecteur Inquisiteur Commandeur) and a member of the lodge Art et Travail in Switzerland and France. (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 2000, part II, p. 417.) When Lenin visited the headquarters of Grand Orient on Rue Cadet in Paris, he signed the visitors' book. (Viktor Kuznetsov, \"The Secret of the October Coup\", St. Petersburg, 2001, p. 42.) Together with Trotsky, Lenin took part in the International Masonic Conference in Copenhagen in 1910. (Franz Weissin, \"Der Weg zum Sozialismus\" / \"The Way to Socialism\", Munich, 1930, p. 9.) The sociali- sation of Europe was on the agenda. Alexander Galpern, then secretary of the Masonic Supreme Council, confirmed in 1916 that there were Bolsheviks among the freemasons. I can further mention Nikolai Sukhanov (actually Himmer) and N. Sokolov. According to Galpern's testimony, the freemasons also gave Lenin financial aid for his revolutionary activity. This was certified by a known freemason, Grigori Aronson, in his article \"Freemasons in Russian Politics\", published in the Novoye Russkoye Slovo (New York, 8th-12th of October, 1959). The historian Boris Nikolayevsky also mentioned this in his book \"The Russian Freemasons and the Revolution\" (Moscow, 1990). 99"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"In 1914, two Bolsheviks, Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov and Grigori Pet- rovsky, contacted the freemason Alex ander Konovalov for economic aid. The latter became a minister in the Provisional Government. Radio Russia also spoke of Lenin's activities as a freemason on the 12th of August 1991. The First Freemasons in Russia The first Masonic lodges in Russia were founded in the 1730s. Catherine II banned all Masonic organisations in Russia April 8, 1782 since they had secret political ties with leading circles abroad. Freemasonry was legalised again in 1801 after Alexander I ascended the throne. He became a freemason himself, despite the fact that his father had been murdered by freemasons. The leading Decembrists (Pavel Pestel, Sergei Trubetskoi and Sergei Volkonsky) belonged to the Masonic lodges, The Reunited Friends (Les Amis Reunis), The Three Virtues, and The Sphinx. The main secret societies of the Decembrists were The United Slavs and The Three Virtues. Freemasonry was banned again in 1822, when the government discovered that the Masonic lodges were actually secret societies planning to transform the state system and infiltrate the government. Tsar Alexander I had discovered that the freemasons were controlled by an invisible hand. Naturally he forbade their activities in Russia. This decision was to cost him his life. Nicholas I, who ruled from 1825 to 1855, became especially strict regarding freemasonry. All the lodges were forced to operate underground. The chief enemies of the Russian freemasons were national monarchism and Christianity. This is why they worked with \"enlightenment propa- ganda\". The Russian freemasons also tended towards cosmopolitanism. Their watchword demanded: \"Be prepared!\", and the freemason had to answer: \"Always prepared!\" Motifs from Judaism and Cabbalism domi- nated the ideology and political symbolism of freemasonry. To an outsider it might all have seemed confusing and unreal. On the 31st of October 1893, Vladimir Ulyanov arrived in the capital, St. Petersburg, where he began his subversive activity. He called himself a professional revolutionary. In the autumn of 1895, after a period abroad, Vladimir Ulyanov, together with other conspirators in St. Petersburg, 100"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"founded the Fighting League for the Liberation of the Working Classes, which developed into a terrorist group. It was actually Israel Helphand (or Geldphand) alias Alexander Parvus, a Jewish multi-millionaire from Odessa, who backed this project. He was a businessman and freemason. According to the British historian Nesta Webster, Parvus became a mem- ber of the German Social Democratic Party in 1886. In December 1895, Vladimir Ulyanov was imprisoned for illegal activi- ties. He spent the years 1898-1900 in exile in Shushenskoye by the Yenisei in Siberia. He received generous benefits from the state. He lived in a spacious house and ate well. In March 1898, the leading Jewish social democrats gathered in Minsk - those representing the international line (the struggle for power in the host nation) as well as those representing the nationalist attitude of the Jewish workers' union Bund, which was founded in Vilno (Vilnius) in 1897, and propagated the founding of a Zionist state. They decided to unite the subversive Marxist groups and to illegally form the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party. Only nine delegates were present at its Constitutional Congress and those elected a central committee consisting of Aron Kremer, Boris Eidelman and Radshenko. Other known social democrats were Pavel (Pinchus) Axelrod (Boruch), Leon Deutsch, Vera Zasulich, Natan Vigdorchik, V. Kosovsky (Levinson), and the only Russian was Georgi Plekhanov, whose wife Roza was a Jewess. In February 1900, Vladimir Ulyanov travelled to Switzerland. Later, he lived in Munich, Brussels, London, Paris, Krakow, Geneva, Stockholm and Zurich. To intensify the Marxist propaganda, the red-bearded Lenin, together with Parvus, founded the subversive newspaper Iskra (The Spark), in Munich in 1900, the first issue of which came out on the 24th of December 1900. The newspaper was smuggled into Russia. For tactical reasons, Lenin made the famous Russian social democrat Georgi Plekhanov the first editor of the newspaper. Plekhanov had no wish to remain Lenin's puppet, however, and so the Jew L. Martov (Yuli Zederbaum) soon replaced him. At the Second Party Congress in Brussels in 1903, Plekhanov supported Martov's suggestion to camouflage the introduction of Socialism with democracy. Lenin demanded the intro- duction of a hard socialist dictatorship. 101"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"In Sweden, the freemasons have successfully used Martov's ideas to build a socialist \"people's home\" and to introduce tax slavery. At this congress, the Jew Martov suggested that the Party should be subordinate to the Jews - the chosen people. In contrast, the half-Jew Lenin, wanted the Jews to be subordinate to the Party. A majority supported Lenin's suggestion and these were therefore called the Bolshe- viks (the majority). The minority (Mensheviks) supported Martov's suggestion and acted in the classic manner of social democrats, using demagogy and cunning. The Party was split. The true reasons have until now been left out of the official Party history. Leon Trotsky was then among the Mensheviks. He regarded Lenin as a despot and a terrorist (Louis Fischer, \"The Life of Lenin\", London, 1970, p. 68). Iskra came under the influence of the Mensheviks. Lenin, who disliked disputes, left the editorial staff and started his own periodical, Vperyod. A famous Jewish textiles magnate and capitalist from Moscow, Savva Morozov, financed this. (Louis Fischer, \"The Life of Lenin\", London, 1970, p. 68.) The Morozov brothers had given the proletarian writer Maxim Gorky a two-storeyed house and provided the Bolsheviks with large amounts of money. Lenin's Nature Lenin tried to work out his own ism, a doctrine, which differed very little from the basic teachings of the Illuminati. Leninism became such a terrible and efficient brake on all areas of social development that the use of that ideology must be regarded as a cr ime against humanity. Russia is now attempting to salvage itself through the process of dismantling Leninism. This is the only way, since Vladimir Ulyanov, known under the pseudo- nym of Lenin, was the root of all the evils of Communism in Russia. His true nature has only recently been revealed. It is doubtful whether any other leader has lied to such an amazing extent about himself and everything else. An incredible amount of myths has been created about him to hide his evil nature and destructive acts. He introduced logocracy (power through the use of barefaced lies), which became a political weapon. Comrade Ulyanov knew that the lie could be changed into truth if 102"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"only it was made credible and attractive and then repeated often enough. He understood that the people would once again become strong and independent if they were kept well informed about the state of affairs, were to decide on their own existence and to work with sensible things. (\"Works\", Vol. 26, p. 228.) This is why he introduced a severe censorship and counted on half-lies to be an even more effective weapon against a sensible development. Only in 1991-1992, were researchers given access to 3724 secret documents. These papers showed clearly what a beast Lenin really was. It was also revealed that Lenin had been an unsuccessful lawyer, who had only had six cases in which he defended shoplifters. He lost all six cases. A week later, he had had enough and gave up the profession. He never had a real job after that. According to both older documents and others, which have been made available more recently, it is clear that Lenin was the worst, most demagogic, bloodthirsty, merciless and inhuman dictator in the history of the world. The American socialist John Reed, who met Lenin, described him as a strange person: colourless and without humour. Despite this, he propagandised for Communism in the United States since he was well paid to do so. Once, in 1920, he was paid the giant sum of 1 080 000 roubles for his services. (Dagens Nyheter, May 30, 1995.) \"Lenin was prepared to annihilate 90 per cent of the population in order that the remaining 10 per cent might live under Communism,\" wrote the author Vladimir Soloukhin in the periodical Ogonyok in December 1990. This was published as a big sensation in Dagens Nyheter on the 13th of January 1991. Lenin expressed himself thus: \"May 90 per cent of the Russian people perish if 10 per cent will experience the world revolution!\" (\"Selected Works\", Vol. 2, p. 702.) Lenin emphasised: \"We must utilise all possible cunning and illegal methods, deny and conceal the truth.\" Lenin demanded: \"The people will be taught to hate. We shall begin with the young. The children will be taught to hate their parents. We can and must write in a new language which sows hatred, detestation and similar fellings among the masses against those who do not agree with us.\" At the Third Comintern Congress on the 5th of July 1921, Lenin said: \"Dictatorship is a state of intensive warfare.\" In this war he was merciful to the \"useful idiots\" (Lenin's term) only at the beginning. Dzerzhinsky 103"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"(Rufin), chief of the Cheka (political police) was truthful when he said: \"We need no justice.\" Lenin, Trotsky and Zinoviev had declared a holy war in the name of Communism on the 1st of September 1920. Zinoviev had called Dzerzhinsky \"the saint of the revolution\". Stalin regarded him as \"the eternal flame\". In reality, he was a sadist and a drug-addict. Lenin declared: \"Peace means, quite simply, the dominion of Commu- nism over the entire world.\" (Lenin, \"Theses about the Tasks of the Communist Youth\".) Lenin's opponents in this war were all who had differing ideas about life and spiritual matters, for such people were physically repugnant to him. He was constantly giving orders for people to be hanged, shot, burned. Thus he demanded the priests in Shuya to be executed to a man. He ordered the city of Baku to be burned down, if its resistance could not be crushed in some other way. At the same time, Lenin was extremely capricious. Lenin ruled by the aid of decrees. There were no longer any laws in force. When the first Soviet penal laws were worked out in 1922, Lenin demanded in his directions that the penal laws should \"justify and legalise terror in principle, clearly, without embellishment\". Hitherto, revelations of this sort have mostly concerned Joseph Stalin, Lenin's faithful pupil. It is now high time to destroy the last remaining myths about Lenin. Lenin became a synonymous for injustice and falsehood. He promised to give the peasants land, but finally confiscated everything. In 1918 he replaced the slogan about the nationalisation of the land with demands about the socialisation of the land. (Yuri Chernichenko's article \"Who Needs the Farmers' Party and Why?\", Literaturnaya Rossiya, 8th March 1991.) Marx had written that the land must be confiscated at once. Lenin put off doing that. Later, he offered 100 000 roubles for every land- owning farmer hanged. Lenin promised to make the worker his own master, but made him a slave instead. He promised to abolish the bureaucratic apparatus, but even in his lifetime it grew into a vast army of parasites. There were 231 000 bureaucrats in Russia in August 1918. In 1922 there were already 243 000, despite Lenin's orders for a lessening of the numbers. In 1988 there were 18 million bureaucrats in the Soviet Empire, 11 per cent of the working population of 165 million. 104"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Lenin claimed that the Party should keep no secrets from the people. But the whole apparatus of the Communist Party was surrounded with secrecy. Lenin promised peace, instead there was civil war. He promised bread but brought about a catastrophic famine. He promised to make the people happy and brought terrible calamities down upon them. It was Lenin who banned the oppositional newspapers. Two days after seizing power, he issued a decree abolishing the freedom of the press. During the first week he shut down ten newspapers and ten more in the following week, until all newspapers he disliked had ceased to exist. Lenin also disbanded all other political parties (except Bund and Po'alei Zion). On the 17th of November 1917, several commissars protested against Lenin's decision to form a government consisting of only one party - the Bolsheviks, since there were other parties represented in the workers' councils. He showed no mercy to his good friend L. Martov, the Jewish leader of the Mensheviks (one of the few whom Lenin used the familiar term of address with). In 1920, he exiled Martov from Soviet Russia, thereby at least sparing his life. It was Lenin who started the first mock-trials. Thus he put twelve social revolutionaries on trial in 1922. Lenin himself had come up with all the trickery necessary to bring about this case. Stalin used similar methods during the years 1936-37. It was Lenin who ordered the arrests of foreign socialists and communists in Russia. The Chekists were given free rein. It was Lenin who came up with the slogan: \"Take back what was robbed!\" According to this exhortation, the Bolsheviks were to plunder all of Russia's riches. On the 22nd of November 1917 he issued a decree in which he demanded that all gold, jewels, furs and other valuables were to be confiscated during house searches (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Mos- cow, Vol. 36,p. 269). The thorough falsification of Lenin's biography concerned even the smallest, least significant details. However, the big lie begins with the small ones. On the 21st of January 1954, Pravda wrote about Lenin's living conditions on Rue Bonieux in Pa ris: \"Vladimir Ilyich lived in a small flat where a tiny room served as his study and where the kitchen was used as both dining and reception room.\" But Lenin himself wrote on the 19th of December 1908 in a letter to his sister: \"We found a very pleasant flat. Four rooms, a kitchen and pantry, water, gas.\" His wife Nadezhda 105"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Krupskaya confirmed in her \"Memoirs\": \"The flat on Rue Bonieux was large and bright and there were even mirrors above the heating stoves. We even had a room for my mother, Maria, there.\" Lenin paid 1000 francs a month for the flat. Lenin also rented an expensive, fou r-roomed flat at Kaptensgatan 17 in Ostermalm (east-central Stockholm) in the autumn of 1910. This is where he met his mother for the last time. The many stories about \"kind-hearted Lenin\" played a major part in the Soviet mythology. The proletarian author Maxim Gorky warned about Lenin with the following words: \"Anyone who does not wish to spend all his time arguing should steer clear of Lenin.\" It must be stressed that Lenin had very few friends. He used the familiar term of address only with his relations and two others, L. Martov and G. Krizhanovsky. He also spoke familiarly with his two love rs, Inessa Armand and Yelena Stasova. His Party comrades disliked him. They did not even tell him about the February coup in 1917. He learned about this when reading Neue Ziircher Zeitung. Even then he had difficulty believing it was true. The Sovietologist Mikhail Voslensky emphasised in his book \"Mortal Gods\" (\"Sterbliche Gotter\", Dietmar Straube Publishing, Erlan- gen/Bonn/Vienna, 1989) that Lenin was one of those few dictators who left plenty of written evidence of his crimes against humanity behind him. Among other things, Lenin demanded: \"The more representatives of the reactionary priesthood we manage to shoot, the better.\" Before the Bolsheviks seized power there were 360 000 priests in Russia. At the end of 1919 only 40 000 remained alive. (Vladimir) Soloukhin, \"In the Light of Day\", Moscow, 1992, p. 59.) Voslensky claims that Lenin was personally responsible for the murders of 13 million people. He believed that Lenin clearly expressed the true value of Marxism. He said: \"What can one extract from poisonous plants except poison?\" Voslensky was of the opinion that Lenin had taken over Marx's credo, whereby he was in the right even when he was wrong. Finally, Voslensky stated that the communist ideology must be criminal, since it has brought forth so many terrible tyrants and demagogues. According to Mikhail Voslensky, Lenin was one of the worst and most vulgar of them. Cruelty and brutality were coupled with cowardice in Lenin's nature. This was claimed by a former Party worker, Oleg Agranyants, in his book 106"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"What is to be Done? or Deleninisation of our Society\" (London, 1989). He gave the following example of Lenin's cowardice: T. Alexinskaya wrote in the periodical Rodnaya Zemlya No. 1, 1926: When I first saw Lenin at a meeting near St. Petersburg in 1906, I was truly disappointed. It was not so much his superficiality, but rather the fact that when someone cried \"Cossacks!\", Lenin was the first to run away. I looked after him. He jumped over the barricade. His hat fell off.\" Similar notes about Lenin can be found among the papers of the Okhrana (the secret police), where it is mentioned that the fleeing Lenin fell into a canal, from which he had to be pulled out. Nobody present at this subversive meeting was detained. Despite Lenin's secret and criminal incomes, he constantly demanded money from his mother until her death in 1916. Stalin brought money to Lcnin's Bolsheviks through bank and train robberies. Maxim Litvinov also commited bank robberies, giving the money to the Bolsheviks. Oleg Agranyants also referred to a report in the files of the Okhrana concerning Lenin's visits to the German embassy in Switzerland. It was later revealed that Lenin was a German agent. Lenin was well aware of the seductive power of money. That was why he generously dealt out cheques for large amounts to farmers and non- Russian nationalists in the autumn of 1919. Some of them were taken in by this swindle and perhaps believed t he Bolsheviks to be a party of Santa Clauses. Nobody could guess that those cheques lacked cover (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", Stockholm, 1987, p. 109). One year earlier (autumn of 1918), Lenin had sent gangs of armed workers to several places in the countryside with orders to bring back as much food produce as possible. (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", Stockholm, 1987, p. 128.) Lenin's Terror Lenin's Jewish wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya wrote about Lenin's bloodlust, cruelty and greed in her \"Memoirs\", published in Moscow in 1932. Krupskaya described how Lenin once rowed a boat out to a little island in the Yenisei River where many rabbits had migrated during the winter. Lenin clubbed so many rabbits to death with the butt of his rifle that the 107"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"boat sank under the weight of all the dead bodies - an almost symbolic act. Lenin enjoyed hunting and killing. Later, after he had seized power, he showed a similarly savage attitude to those who did not agree with his plans of enslavement. And how many really supported his barbarous methods? In 1975, a collection of documents was published in Moscow, \"Lenin and the Cheka\", which explains that Lenin had adopted the terror methods of Maximilien \"de\" Robespierre. The latter had been merciless, especially to the spiritual aristocracy. As early as the 24th of January 1918, Lenin said that the communist terror should have been much more merciless (\"There is a long way to go to the real terror\"). On April 28, 1918, Pravda and Izvestiya published Lenin's article \"The Present Tasks of the Soviet Power\" where he wrote, among other things: \"Our regime is too soft.\" He thought the Russians unsuited to implement his terror - they were too well intentioned. That was why he preferred the Jews. Naturally, not all the Jews joined, only the worst, most hateful and most fanatical ones. This fact that Lenin believed the Jews to be much more efficient in the \"revolutionary struggle\" was kept a state secret by order of Joseph Stalin, despite the fact that Maria Ulyanova had wanted to make it public a few years after Vladimir Lenin's death. Lenin's sister believed that this fact would have been useful in the struggle against anti-Semitism (Dagens Nyheter, 15th February 1995). The vice-chairman of the Cheka, Martyn Lacis (actually Janis Sudrabs, a Latvian Jew) wrote the following in his book \"The Cheka's Struggle against the Counter-Revolution\" (Moscow, 1921, p. 8): \"We Israelites must build the society of the future on the basis of constant fear.\" Lenin wrote a letter in 1918, in which he commented upon the critical nature of the situation. It is apparent that Lenin managed to mobilise 1 400 000 Jews, the majority of whom worked for the Cheka. They were given free rein. Afterwards, Lenin wrote: \"These Jewish elements were mobilised against the saboteurs. In this way, they succeeded in saving the revolution at this critical stage.\" (Todor Dichev, \"The Terrible Conspiracy\", Moscow, 1994, pp. 40-41.) I personally know several anti-Communist Jews who have distanced themselves from the fanatical Jews' terrible atrocities in the Soviet Union, since those crimes have discredited all other Jews. 108"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"On the 26th of June 1918, Lenin gave orders to \"expand the revo- lutionary terror\". In Lenin's opinion, it was impossible to bring about a revolution without executions. He especially wanted to shoot all those responsible for counter-propaganda. According to Leon Trotsky's testi- mony, Lenin had shouted: \"Is this dictatorship? This is just semolina pudding!\" about ten times a day throughout July 1918. In the same year he gave orders to execute 200 people in Petrograd for the sole reason that they had attended church, been working with handicraft or had sold something. Here are some examples of Lenin's \"mild\" telegrams in 1918: \"A troika of dictators should be established and mass-terror should be begun at once. The prostitutes who drink with soldiers and former officers should be shot or deported at once. We must not wait a single minute! Full speed to the mass arrests! Execute weapons owners! Begin the mass deportation of the Mensheviks and the other suspects!\" (\"Collected Works\", 3rd edition, Vol. 29, p. 489.) \"In the class struggle, we have always backed the use of terrorism.\" (\"Collected Works\", 4th edition, Vol. 35, p. 275.) \"The executions should be increased!\" (\"Collected Works\", 5th edition, Vol. 45, p. 189.) The war historian Dmitri Volgokonov found in the KGB archives a dreadful decree, which he published in his book. In this decree, Lenin demanded that all peasants resisting t he Bolsheviks should be hanged. The tyrant specified: \"At least a hundred of them, so that all may see!\" The peasants in the province of Penza began to resist at the beginning of August 1918. Lenin at once sent a telegram to the local executive com- mittee with instructions to start practising merciless terror against the kulaks (well-to-do farmers), the priests and the White Guards. He recom- mended that all \"suspect people\" should be sent to concentration camps. Three days later, he sent a new message in which he expressed surprise at not having received any messages in answer to his demands. He hoped that no one was showing any weakness in dealing with the revolt and wrote that the possessions of the farmers (especially corn) should be confiscated. Winston Churchill called the Bolsheviks \"angry baboons\" on the 26th of November 1918. Lists of those shot and otherwise executed were published in the Cheka's weekly newspaper. In this way it can be proved that 1.7 million 109"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"people were executed during the period 1918-19. A river of blood flowed through Russia. The Cheka had to employ body counters. According to official Soviet reports from May 1922, 1 695 904 people were executed from January 1921 to April 1922. Among these victims were bishops, pro- fessors, doctors, officers, policemen, gendarmes, lawyers, civil servants, journalists, writers, artists, nurses, workers and farmers... Their crime was \"anti-social thinking\". Here it must be pointed out that the Cheka was under the control of Jews, according to documents now available. Much of this was known already in 1925. The researcher Larseh wrote in his book \"The Blood-Lust of Bolshevism\" (Wurttemberg, p. 45) that 50 per cent of the Cheka consisted of Jews with Jewish names, 25 per cent were Jews who had taken Russian names. All the chiefs were Jews. Lenin was well informed about all those serious crimes. All of the documents were placed on his desk. Lenin answered: \"Put more force into the terror... shoot every tenth person, place all the suspects in con- centration camps!\" The idea of \"concentration camps\" was not Hitler's invention, as many now believe. Actually, the first concentration camps were built in 1838 in the United States for Indians. This method of isolating people appealed also to other cruel rulers. In 1898 concentration camps were built in Cuba, where the Spaniards imprisoned all oppositional elements. In 1901, the English used the same form of colle ctive imprisonment during the Boer war, where the name \"concentration camps\" was also used. 26 000 Boer women and children starved to death in the British camps; 20 000 of them were under 16 years old. Lenin incarcerated people without any sentence, despite the establishment of revolutionary tribunals, as was the case in France under the Jacobins. Lenin actually claimed that the concentration camps were schools of labour. (Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, doctors of history, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 67.) Lenin also claimed that the factory was the workers' only school. They did not need any other education. He emphasised that anyone who could only do simple arithmetic could run a factory. Just like the terror of the Jacobins in France, the Jewish Bolshevik functionaries used barges to drown people in. Bela Kun (actually Aaron Kohn) and Roza Zemlyachka (actually Rozalia Zalkind) drowned Russian 110"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"officers in this way in the Crimea in the autumn of 1920. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 73.) The unusually cruel Jewish Chekist Mikhail Kedrov (actually Zederbaum) drowned 1092 Russian officers in the White Sea in the spring of 1920. Lenin and his accomplices did not arrest just anyone. They executed those most active in society, the independent thinkers. Lenin gave orders to kill as many students as possible in several towns. The Chekists arrested every youth wearing a school cap. They were liquidated because Lenin believed the coming Russian intellectuals would be a threat to the Soviet regime. (Vladimir Soloukhin, \"In the Light of Day\", Moscow 1992, p. 40.) The role of the Russian intellectuals in society was taken over by the Jews. Many students (for example in Yaroslavl) learned quickly and hid their school caps. Afterwards, the Chek ists stopped all suspect youths and searched their hair for the stripe of the school cap. If the stripe was found, the youth was killed on the spot. The author Vladimir Soloukhin revealed that the Chekists were especially interested in handsome boys and pretty girls. These were the first to be killed. It was believed that there would be more intellectuals among attractive people. Attractive youths were therefore killed as a danger to society. No crime as terrible as this has hitherto been described in the history of the world. The terror was co-ordinated by the Chekist functionary Joseph Unsch- licht. How did they go about the murders? The Jewish Chekists flavoured murder with various torture methods. In his documentary \"The Russia We Lost\", the director Stanislav Govorukhin told how the priesthood in Kherson were crucified. The archbishop Andronnikov in Perm was tortured: his eyes were poked out, his ears and nose were cut off. In Kharkov the priest Dmitri was undressed. When he tried to make the sign of the cross, a Chekist cut off his right hand. Several sources tell how the Chekists in Kharkov placed the victims in a row and nailed their hands to a table, cut around their wrists with a knife, poured boiling water over the hands and pulled the skin off. This was called \"pulling off the glove\". In other places, the victim's head was placed on an anvil and slowly crushed with a steam hammer. Those due to undergo the same punishment the next day were forced to watch. The eyes of church dignitaries were poked out, their tongues were cut off and they were buried alive. There were Chekists who used to cut open 111"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the stomachs of their victims, following which they pulled out a length of the small intestine and nailed it to a telegraph pole and, with a whip, forced the unlucky victim to run circles around the pole until the whole intestine had been unravelled and the victim died.

Other Chekists crushed the heads of their victims with special head- screws, or drilled them through with dental tools. The upper part of the skull was sawn off and the nearest in line was forced to eat the brain, following which the procedure would be repeated to the end of the line. The Chekists often arrested whole families and tortured the children before the eyes of their parents, and the wives before their husbands. Mikhail Voslensky, a former Soviet functionary, described some of the cruel methods used by the Chekists in his book \"Nomenklatura\" / \"Nomenclature\" (Stockholm, 1982, p. 321): \"In Kharkov, people were scalped. In Voronezh, the torture victims were placed in barrels into which nails were hammered so that they stuck out on the inside, upon which the barrels were set rolling. A pentacle (usually a five-pointed star formerly used in magic) was burned into the foreheads of the victims. In Tsaritsyn and Kamyshin, the hands of victims were ampu- tated with a saw. In Poltava and Kremenchug, the victims were impaled. In Odessa, they were roasted alive in ov ens or ripped to pieces. In Kiev, the victims were placed in coffins with a decomposing body and buried alive, only to be dug up again after half an hour.\" Lenin was dissatisfied with these reports and demanded: \"Put more force into the terror!\" All of this happened in the provinces. The reader can try to imagine how people were executed in Moscow. The Russian-Jewish newspaper Yevreyskaya Tribuna stated on the 24th of August 1922 that Lenin had asked the rabbis if they were satisfied with the particularly cruel executions. The Ideological Background of the Terror Compare the crimes mentioned in the previous chapter with the Old Testament account of King David's massacre of the entire civilian popu- lation of an enemy (\"thus did he unto all the cities of the children of 112"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Ammon\"). He \"cut them with saws and with harrows of iron\" and \"made them pass through the brickkiln\". After the Second World War, this text was changed in most European Bibles. Now, many Bibles state that the people were put to work with the tools mentioned and were occupied with brick-making - something the inhabitants had been doing continually for several thousand years already. (This is found in II Samuel, 12:31, and in I Chronicles 20:3.) The Jewish extremists' serious crimes in Russia were committed in the true spirit of the Old Testament (King James' Bible): * The god of the Israelites demands the mass-murder of Gentiles (i.e. goyim = non-Jews), including women and children. (Deuteronomy, 20:16.) * Yahweh wishes to spread terror among the Gentiles (Deuteronomy, 2:25). * Yahweh demands the destruction of other religions (Deuteronomy, 7:5). * The Jews may divide the prey of a great spoil (Isaiah, 33:23). * The Jews may make Gentiles their slaves (Isaiah, 14:2). * Those refusing to serve the Jews shall perish and be utterly wasted (Isaiah, 60:12). * Gentiles shall be forced to eat their own flesh (Isaiah, 49:26). Returning to the Bolshevik terror: in order to control the people's hatred of their Jewish torturers and executioners, people suspected of having an anti-Semitic attitude were also executed. Those in possession of the book \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" were executed on the spot. At the end of March 1919, Lenin was forced to explain: \"The Jews are not the enemies of the working classes... they are our friends in the struggle for Socialism.\" But the people hated precisely this Socialism and those who practised terror in its name. Vladimir Ulyanov's passion was to kill as many people as possible without thinking of the consequences. Of course, he never wondered whether it was really possible to build a state on violence and evil. Lenin showed the same kind of thoughtlessness by the Yenisei, where he had loaded his boat with so many dead rabbits with crushed heads that it sank under the weight. In August 1991 the state-ship Lenin had launched, sank. What else was to be expected? In the beginning of the 1920s there were already 70 000 prisoners in 300 concentration camps, according to \"The Russian Revolution\" by 113"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Richard Pipes at Harvard University, though in reality there were probably many more. It was in this manner that Lenin built his GULAG archipelago. Lenin often demonstrated short-sightedness or complete stupidity. For example, he hated railways. According to him, the railways were suitable for cultured civilisation only in the eyes of bourgeois professors. In Lenin's opinion, railways were a weapon with which to suppress millions of people. (\"Collected Works\", 2nd edition, Vol. 19, p. 74.) The workers on the Baikal-Amur railway were not given this quote to read in their barracks. In 1916, Lenin claimed that capitalism would very soon die out. His Communism fell first. Lenin was not in the least interested in the world's cultural heritage. He never visited the Louvre whilst in Paris. In 1910 he actually called Paris a despicable hole. The Jewish revolutionary Maria Essen, in her book \"Memories of Lenin\" (part 1, p. 244) confirms that Lenin never visited museums or exhibitions. Gorky, however, forced him to visit the National Museum of Naples. He avoided the workers' quarters of towns. (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", Stockholm, 1987, p. 82.) Indeed, Marx had said that the workers were stupid cattle. Lenin did not like listening to music. Why waste time on such rubbish? In his opinion, music awakened unnecessarily beautiful thoughts. This was why he did not want anyone else to listen to music either, least of all to opera. Stalin's interpreter, Valentin Berezhkov, reveals in his memoranda that Lenin wanted to shut down the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, since the working classes had no need of operas. Only when it was explained to Lenin that opera music was a part of the Russian culture did he grudgingly give in. He had visited the Theatre of Arts only a few times, claims Anatoli Lunacharsky who also confirmed that Lenin was entirely ignorant of art. Lenin stressed that art must be utilised for the purposes of propaganda. The purpose of art and culture was, according to Lenin, to serve Socialism, nothing else. This was why many Jewish abstractionists and other art jokers were immediately employed, among others Vasili Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich and Isaac Brodsky, to make all public places shine with communist symbols, slogans and placards. Proletkult (the culture of the proletariat = culturelessness) was founded on Lenin's orders. Later, repressive methods were used to establish socialist realism - 114"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"a rape of the arts in public. In this way the aristocratic, noble arts were destroyed. At the head of the decadent placard painters was the Jew and freemason Marc Chagall, who for a time acted as Art Commissar in Vitebsk. Election campaigns were an unscientific method, thought Lenin. At the same time he gravely misjudged the political situation. Lenin said that \"the world war cannot come\" in Krakow in 1912. (\"Collected Works\", 4th edition, Vol. 16, p. 278.) However hard the \"great leader\" of the proletariat tried, he could never learn to use a typewriter. (Oleg Agranyants, \"What Should Be Done?\", London, 1989.) He hated all intellectuals; perhaps this was the result of an inferiority complex. Anatoli Lunacharsky (actually Bailikh Mandelstam), People's Com- missary for Educational Affairs 1917-29 and a member of the Grand Orient, remembered how Gorky had complained to Lenin in 1918 about the imprisonment of the same intellectuals who had earlier helped Lenin and his companions in Petrograd. Lenin answered with a cynical smile: \"Their houses must be searched and they themselves imprisoned precisely because they are good people. They always show compassion for the oppressed. They are always against persecution. This is why they can now be suspected of housing cadets and Octobrists.\" (The collection \"Lenin and the Cheka\", Moscow, 1975.) According to Lenin, there were no innocents among the intellectuals. All were the main enemies of Communism. They were either against or neutral. They always sympathised with those who were persecuted at the time. In answering a letter to M. Andreyeva on the 19th of September 1919, Lenin was honest to admit: \"Not jailing the intellectuals would be a crime.\" He thought that they were in a position to aid the opposition and were therefore potentially dangerous. Lenin's primary goal was to exterminate the most intelligent part of the Russian population. When the giants are gone, the dwarves may revel. The Chekists usually invented the charges against the intellectuals. Sometimes Lcnin released a scientist he had special need of. Maxim Gorky used to make enquiries. Lenin skilfully utilised Gorky as a famous and popular author, since he needed him for reasons of propaganda. That was why he sometimes released certain intellectuals whom Gorky wanted freed from 115"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"the Cheka's claws. Later, Lenin began to systematically utilise the knowledge of imprisoned scientists for his own purposes. Lenin began the persecution of intellectuals immediately after his rise to power. He made them starve to death or forced them to emigrate, or jailed or murdered them. Thus he gave orders to murder hundreds of thousands of intellectuals. In a letter to Maxim Gorky on September 15th, 1919, he called the learned \"shits\". He also called the Russian intellectuals spies who intended to lead the young students to destruction. On the 21st of February 1922 he demanded the dismissal of 20-40 professors at the Moscow Technical College, since they \"are making us stupid\". On the 10th of May 1922, he issued a decree demanding that the Russian intellectuals should be systematically expelled from the country by way of pest control. He wanted this letter kept secret. On the 16th-18th of September 1922, \"160 of the most active bourgeois ideologues\" were expelled by government decree. Among these were Leon Karsavin, Principal of the University of Petrograd, and Novikov, Principal of the University of Moscow. He also expelled Staranov, head of the mathematics department at Moscow University, world famous biologists, zoologists, philosophers, historians, economists, mathematicians, several authors and publicists. Philosophers like Nikolai Berdyayev, Sergei Bulgakov and Ivan Ilyin, as well as Vladimir Zvorykin and the author Ivan Bunin, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1933, can also be mentioned. There were no important names among these, if the GPU (political police) were to be believed. The Bolsheviks kept quiet the fact that nearly all of those expelled belonged to various secret societies, among others the Light Blue Star. Trotsky demanded as early as 1918 that the Cheka leave this organisation alone. In this way Lenin drained the country of its finest minds. Eventually, Lenin managed to purge Russia almost entirely of educated, wise and free- thinking people. The worst began to rule the best of those who were still left. What had been regarded as wrong for centuries now became a virtue. In this way, Lenin introduced the right to dishonesty. Lenin became completely intoxicated with the possibility of murdering and plundering with impunity. Instead of the word \"plunder\", he preferred \"confiscate\", \"seize\", \"take and not return\", just like a real bandit! He wrote: \"I do not want to believe that you would show any weakness in 116"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"confiscating wealth.\" (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", second edition, Vol. 29, p. 491.) He lacked mercy also for the common people; he did not give a thought to their fate. At the same time, he constantly controlled the efficiency of Chekists. On the 2nd of April 1921, he demanded a decrease in the number of mouths to feed in the factories. He meant that those in excess should be executed. A true terrorist, Lenin demanded that the Bolsheviks should take hostages, who were to be mercilessly executed if he did not have his way. He commanded hostages to be taken in all plundering expeditions. Those hostages were to be killed if wealth and possessions were not handed over to the Red Guards, or if an attempt to conceal any part of their wealth was made. Eventually, all Soviet citizens became hostages anyway, locked into a ghetto walled in by the iron curtain. Those who might pose a threat to the Bolsheviks' dominion were isolated within the ghetto in the concentration camps. The following can be read in \"The Decision on the Red Terror\", September 5, 1918: \"The Soviet Republic must rid itself of class enemies by isolating them in concentration camps...\" (\"Decrees of the Soviet Power\", Moscow, 1964, p. 295.) The author Maxim Gorky, who was well aware of Lenin's intolerance, characterised him in this way: \"Lenin was no all-powerful wizard, but a cold-blooded bluff who cared nothing for either honour or the life of the proletarian.\" Source: Gorky's article \"To Democracy\", published in the newspaper Novaya Zhizn, No. 174, 7th (20th) of November 1917. When the Jew Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, a close associate of Lenin, tricd to restrain him somewhat, believing that the chief revolutionary would bring about the wholesale destruction of Russia if he was not halted, Lenin answered: \"I spit on Russia, for I am a Bolshevik.\" (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 17.) This expression also became a slogan for the other leading Bolsheviks and Russia was turned into a bandit state. \"Socialism is the ideology of envy,\" declared the philosopher Nikolai Berdyayev in 1918. If he had said this openly, he would have been shot on the spot. This was true, since Lenin, after exploiting the envy of the workers and poor peasants, began to mercilessly eliminate those who resisted him, just like when he clubbed the rabbits. He gave orders to open 117"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"fire on the workers if necessary, which actually happened when peaceful demonstrators in Astrakhan were fired upon in March 1919. Two thousand workers were killed. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, pp. 58-59.) One hundred railway builders in Yekaterinoslavl were shot for trying to organise a strike. The shooting of workers in this way continued up to the middle of April 1919. In the first three months of 1919 alone, 138 000 workers were shot. The Bolsheviks finally managed to destroy nearly all of the best workers. Labour activists were also fired upon in the reign of Nikita Khrushchev. Soviet soldiers shot 80 demonstrators in Novocherkassk by the Black Sea in June 1962. It was Lenin who introduced the method of shooting people on the spot. He stamped Russian businessmen as enemies of the people and then gave orders for them to be shot as speculators. The Chekists used certain tricks to lure their victims to their place of execution. 2000 tsarist officers were called to a theatre in Kiev for control of identity papers. All were shot without mercy. Another 2000 were shot on the spot in Stavropol. Lenin encouraged the soldiers to kill their officers, the workers to kill their engineers and directors, the peasants to kill their landowners. Towards the end of 1922 there were virtually no intelligent people left in Russia, and the few left did not have any possibility of publishing on otherwise giving vent to their ideas. The great author Mikhail Bulgakov was allowed to speak openly after the death of Lenin but the agitatory clown Vladimir Mayakovsky (of Jewish extraction) immediately threate- ned: \"It was by pure chance that we let Bulgakov squeak, which he did, to the delight of the bourgeoisie. But it was the last time.\" Then Jewish bureaucrats harassed Bulgakov to the end of his days. \"All has been forbidden. I am crushed, persecuted and totally alone,\" he wrote in a letter to Gorky. 13 of Bulgakov's 15 cr itics were Jews. (Dagens Nyheter, August 10, 1988.) Many poets perished under Lenin. Among those executed was the 35- year-old poet Nikolai Gumilev, killed on the 21st of August 1921. It was Grigori Zinoviev who gave the order to execute Nikolai Gumilev. At the beginning of the New Economic Policy, Lenin was dissatisfied that the terror had to be reined in, but he promised to continue even more intensively in the future. \"It is the greatest mistake to believe that NEP means the end of the terror. We shall continue the terror later, and also the 118"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"economic terror,\" wrote Lenin to Leon Kamenev (actually Rosenfeld) on the 8th of March 1922. In his childhood, the little Vova Ulyanov liked to order about and terrorise his youngest sister Olga. He also enjoyed destroying his toys. Lenin was extremely displeased with the results of the agitation of the peasants in 1905: \"Unfortunately, the peasants destroyed only a fifteenth of the estates; only a fifteenth of what they should have destroyed.\" (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", second edition, Vol. 19, p. 279.) In France, the Jacobin \"revolutionaries\" had ordered the peasants to destroy castles and manors. Lenin also ordered churches plundered and destroyed. In this manner he collected 48 billion roubles in gold. (\"In the Light of Day\" by Vladimir Soloukhin, Moscow, 1992, p. 59.) The monastery at Solovetsk was turned into a concentration camp. In the same way, the museums were looted and the booty smuggled abroad. The largest Rembrandt collection in the world was kept at the Hermitage, but this was sold, like art treasures from Russian mansions. On the 7th of November, Lenin said in a speech to the Russian people: \"You must be prepared to sacrifice everything to conquer the world!\" Lenin never wanted to reach the truth through discussion. He was only interested in enforcing the will of his criminal organisation through deception, plunder and murder. Since the Russian people refused to accept the Bolsheviks' insane system, they were forced to liquidate a third of the population, wrote the author Vladimir Soloukhin in the periodical Ogonyok in December of 1990. Vladimir Lenin took over many of the methods of the anarchist terrorist Sergei Nechayev (1847-82), who had plans to introduce barracks- Communism into Russia. Lenin called his own method \"war-Commu- nism\". Nechayev had worked with the Illuminatus Mikhail Bakunin. Due to the influence of Bakunin, Nechayev came to believe that everything was morally justifiable to a revolutionary. He even recommended joining robbers, who could also be said to belong to the true revolutionaries. This idea became the basis of Lenin's later tactics. Mao Zedong (China) also used these same tactics. Nechayev had taken part in the student troubles in 1868 and tried to set up a terrorist organisation called The Axe or The People's Settlement in Moscow the following year. He later founded the terrorist group Hell, in 119"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"which the Marxist terrorist Nikolai Fedoseyev (1871-1898) eventually became an important figure. He poisoned his father in order to donate his inheritance to revolutionary activity. Fedoseyev founded the first Marxist clubs in Kazan. One of the members of these was Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), who joined in 1888. (The collection \"Chernyshevsky and Nechayev\", Moscow, 1983.) Sergei Nechayev wrote \"The Catechism of the Revolution\" in 1868-69, in which he asserted: \"There is a need for conspirators with iron-hard discipline for the revolution to succeed. These must spy even on their comrades and report every suspicious act.\" In this way, Nechayev personally organised the murder of a critical member. After this, he fled abroad in 1872. The Swiss police extradited him to Russia in the same year, and he was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour. In his \"Catechism of the Revolution\" Nechayev stressed that a revo- lutionary must be merciless against all of society, especially against the intellectuals. But he must also exploit the fanaticism of the individualist terrorists. These were later to be forgotten or even destroyed according to need. As we know, Stalin began to liquidate social revolutionary terrorists - all in line with Lenin's instructions. A well-known children's song in praise of Lenin goes like this: \"The great Lenin was so noble, considerate, wise and good.\" But the \"good\" Lenin did not care about the living conditions of the people. He hated children. Lenin was only interested in his own power and well-being. He also saw to it that his gang of bandits lived well, and also his relatives. Lenin organised holidays for his relatives to various spas, had this paid for by the state and gave them state subsidies. There is written evidence of how Lenin gave Sergo Ordzhonikidze orders to take care of his lover Inessa Armand in the best possible manner when she arrived in Kislo- vodsk. The first special telephone was given to the same \"comrade Inessa\". It was Lenin who introduced the privileges of the Nomenclatura, whilst he changed the life of normal people into a downright nightmare. It can be mentioned here that when Lenin spent 14 months in a jail in St. Petersburg in 1895-96, he received meals directly from a restaurant. He also ordered a special mineral water from a pharmacy. As a dictator, Lenin's ugly attributes came to the fore. He kept his personal fortune, which he had gained from plundered art, valuables and gems he had sold, in a Swiss bank. In 1920 alone, Lenin transferred 75 120"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"million Swiss francs into his account. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 83.) This was confirmed in The New York Times in the same year. The same newspaper wrote on the 23rd of August 1921 that comrade Leon Trotsky had two personal bank accounts in the United States in which he had a total of 80 million dollars. Meanwhile, Lenin claimed that there was no money to help the hungry or to support culture with. According to the myth, Lenin thought only of others. Lenin had earlier stolen money from the Party funds, despite the fact he received his wages from the same source. Once he emptied the whole fund to buy votes from members of the Central Committee. One can read the following in \"The Memories of the Russian Socialist\" by T. Alexinskaya (Paris, 1923): \"According to Lenin's instructions, Nikolai Shemashko transferred the entire Party funds to an account of a fictitious committee... Lenin bribed certain members of the Central Committee so that they would vote for him.\" At a meeting at the International Bureau of Socialism in Brussels on the 20th of June 1914, Georgy Plekhanov said, among other things: \"Ulyanov does not want to return the Party's money, which he has appropriated like a thief.\" (Excerpt from the minutes.) In England, charges were raised against Lenin for an unpaid debt. In 1907, he had borrowed money from the soap-boiler Feltz, which he had promised to repay, but had not. The police wanted Ulyanov. The police in France also wanted him in 1907, following which he travelled to other countries, including Sweden. He owed 10 000 gold roubles to a band of robbers, who should have received arms for this money through Lenin. The leader of the gang, Stepan Lbov, was caught and hanged. With this, Lenin believed the problem was solved. But one of the bandits came to demand the money. Lenin fled, but was sought after by the police. He had also appropriated the inheritance of the millionaire Schmidt, amounting to 475 000 Swiss francs. So doing, Lenin acted in accordance with the Jesuit-Illuminist principle - the ends justify the means. Independently thinking people will be aware that the immense crimes of the Soviet Communist Party can never be atoned for. It is equally impossible to justify the acts of \"individual comrades\", Lenin among others. In fact Lenin was fascinated by violence. He spoke of the so-called French Revolution and above all praised the violence it had involved. 121"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Lenin was entranced by violence - he used to lick his lips when a chance to use violence presented itself. Mark Yelizarov, the husband of Lenin's older sister Anna, said to comrade Georgi Solomon that Lenin was abnormal. (Georgi Solomon, \"Lenin and his Family\", Paris, 1931.) Charles Rappoport asserted in 1914 that Lenin was a swindler of the worst sort. Vyacheslav Menzhinsky called Lenin a political Jesuit in the Russian exile newspaper Nashe Slovo (Paris, July 1916). Menzhinsky was named People's Commissary for Financial Affairs after the Bolshevik seizure of power. In 1918, he was Soviet Russia's consul-general in Berlin and later, in 1919, he held leading positions within the Cheka. In 1926, he became head of the OGPU (political police), a position he held until 1934, when Stalin had him executed. In 1916, Menzhinsky had openly stated that the aim of the Leninists was to suppress the voice of the workers. He later became an infamous mass-murderer. Even the merciless sadist Leon Trotsky called Lenin a hooligan at a meeting of the Politburo, because Lenin, when angry, used to call his fellow criminals marauders, idiots, mongrels, thieves, carrion, criminals, parasites, speculants... On November 7, 1990, Swedish TV showed a programme about the October coup and its consequences. There were interviews with both Leninist-Stalinists and White Guards. Alexander Kondratyevich, former officer in the tsarist Russian army, now living in Paris, had personally seen Lenin. He said that Lenin's eyes were evil and radiated hatred, and he shook with evil and hatred as he spoke. Kondratyevich got the impression that Lenin somehow suffered from paranoia. The Russian author Alexander Kuprin (1870-1938), who emigrated from his homeland in 1919 to return in 1937 described Lenin in the following manner: \"Short with broad shoulders and skinny.\" He thought Lenin was shallow. The author Nikolai Valentinov wrote the book \"The Lesser-Known Lenin\" (Paris, 1972). He thought Lenin's ugly little eyes radiated a piercing contempt, compact coldness and a bottomless wickedness. Valen- tinov claimed that Lenin's gaze reminded him of the stare of an angry boar. The English philosopher Bertrand Russell maintained that Lenin was the worst person he had ever met. He described in his memoirs how Lenin 122"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"spoke of peasants he had hanged and began to laugh as if it had been a joke. It has been made public in the Russian press how, when Felix Dzer- zhinsky (actually Rufin), chief of the Cheka, told Lenin of the execution of five hundred leading intellectuals in 1918, the great dictator, in his joy, began to neigh like a horse. He went into ecstasies and cheered out of satisfaction. In August 1990, the artist Ilya Glazunov was on Leningrad's most popular TV programme, \"600 Seconds\", where the host asked him: \"Who do you believe to be the greatest criminal of the twentieth century?\" Glazunov answered: \"Isn't it obvious? Everyone realises who it is.\" The host was stubborn: \"No, I have no idea whom you mean. Tell me, who are you thinking of?\" Glazunov said: \"Lenin, of course.\" Many people who knew Lenin personally stated that chiefly hatred and merciless cruelty fueled him. He always received news of executions with a smile. He wanted house searches and arrests to occur at night. The real leader of the terrorist organisation Cheka was actually Lenin. At the Seventh Soviet Congress in December of 1919, Lenin stressed that well- organised terror was necessary. He explained that a good communist must at the same time be a good Chekist. Another myth claims that Stalin took power from the so-called Workers' Councils against Lenin's will. But Lenin wrote the following as early as 1918: '\"All power to the Workers' Councils!' was the slogan of the peaceful revolution. It is no longer applicable.\" (Lenin, \"Collected Works'', Vol. 25, p. 156.) According to another myth, Lenin advocated democracy and freedom. If only he had had a longer time in power, everything would have been different. Lenin stressed as early as 1917 that the workers needed no liberty, equality or fraternity. (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 26, p. 249.) He also said that Marxism lacked ethics. The only ethics of Marxism is the class struggle. (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 26, p. 378.) Stalin did not deviate from the path of Leninism, as was later asserted. He dismantled NEP, which had by then served its purpose. Lenin had given instructions to that effect. Gorbachev also went by these guidelines. Lenin wrote: \"If the front-line attack fails, we should go around and continue more slowly. We must exploit capitalism.\" This was in 1921 123"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"before the beginning of the New Economic Policy. (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 32, p. 318.) Olgerts Eglits, member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, on the 17th of April 1989, in the newspaper Atmoda (The Awakening), stated that Stalin had carefully followed Leninist principles. Everybody is likely to remember the bloody events that took place in Riga and Vilnius in January 1991. They, too, were a result of Leninist politics. Among other documents discovered in Trotsky's archives was a letter from Lenin to Yefraim Shklansky, Jewish Vice People's Commissary for Military Affairs, written in August 1920. Lenin had learned how, in Estonia, volunteers were being drafted into the Polish army. The plan was to send them to Poland via Riga in Latvia. So Lenin decided: \"It is not enough to send a few diplomatic protests... Use military means, i.e. Latvia and Estonia must be punished militarily (follow, for example, Balakhovich across the border and hang 100-1000 officials and rich people).\" Lenin promised to pay 100 000 roubles for every person hanged. Lenin's cunning plan was to disguise his terrorists as Stanislav Bulak- Balakhovich's white guards. This letter was left out of \"Collected Works\" and was first published in the periodical Das Land und die Welt No. 4, in Munich in 1984, and also in Russia after the fall of Communism. Wasn't it a typical Leninist trick to make Vytautas Landsbergis respon- sible for the Soviet bloodbath in Vilnius in January 1991? Alexander Solzhenitsyn has emphasized that Lenin had virtually nothing in common with the Russian culture, since he belonged to the so- called internationalists. That was why he waged a war against every form of national culture. His policy in national questions prescribed fusion of different nationalities and national cultures. The saint of the Bolsheviks wrote in 1919: \"The peoples shall be mixed. The national stagnation must cease.\" (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 20, p. 55.) Six years earlier in 1913 he had declared: \"From a social democratic point of view, the national culture must not be strengthened, since the spiritual life of all humanity will be internationalised already under capitalism. Under Socialism it will be internationalised completely.\" (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 19, p. 213.)

His book \"What is to be Done? Or the Most Important Task of our Time - Deleninisation of Our Society\", was published in London in 1989. It was actually surprisi ng how vehemently he unmasked Lcnin. Oleg Agranyants claimed, among other things, that Lenin trusted Stalin completely. Stalin, meanwhile, felt contempt for Nadezhda Krupskaya. Stalin even threatened her in the following manner: \"If necessary, we will say that Lenin's real wife was Stasova!\" Stalin presumably had a reason for this utterance, since the well-known Jewish Bolshevik Yelena Stasova, best known for her leadership of MOPR or the Red Aid, claimed many times in her 93 years that Lenin had used her name, Lena, as his pseudonym. The first time Vladimir Ulyanov called himself Lenin was in December 1901. In his book, Oleg Agranyants regrets that Lenin's lover's name was Lena and not Varya. Then, instead of Marxism-Leninism, we would have had Marxism-Varvarism (in English: Marxism-Barbarism). Krupskaya never called her husband Lenin. Before the Bolshevik seizure of power she signed all documents Ulyanova. After the introduction of the red dictatorship she signed as Krupskaya. Oleg Agranyants explained that Lenin's letter to the Party Congress, which is better known as his testament wherein Stalin was described with harsh words and not recommended for leadership, is in fact a banal forgery. Krupskaya wrote this letter. During this period, Lenin's health was so bad that he sometimes forgot his own name. The tyrant, suffering from progressing mental and physical decay, was not capable of dictating a letter. The Politburo knew this and therefore never took this letter seriously. Also by its language, it differed from Lenin's other notes and writings. If Lenin's earlier writings are studied, only two or three documents can be found which do not praise Stalin while Lenin was extremely severe on his other collaborators. He always had something unpleasant to say about Trotsky or Kamenev or Zinoviev or Bukharin. As the reader will have noticed, he was not particularly restrained in his mode of expression. Stalin never did anything, which would have diverged from Lenin's opinions or writings. It was Lenin, not Stalin, who began deporting the relatives of his political opponents. It must be pointed out here that the taking of hostages was a state policy, which had been planned by Lenin 125"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"and Trotsky, and not simply a result of the cruelty and mercilessness of individual terrorists. It was Lenin who started the plundering expeditions and mass murders. Lenin even demanded all homeless people to be executed on the spot. Stalin followed the same pattern. He only followed Lenin's decree from January 1918, which exhorted that Russia be purged of all possible vermin for the foreseeable future. I might mention here that Stalin's attitude toward cultural values was somewhat milder than Lenin's. There was still, of course, no straying from the true Leninist doctrine. Stalin wanted to seem democratic. That was why he introduced so-called general elections for demagogic reasons. In contrast, Lenin had said that the people had nothing to say in the matter, since he, Lenin, had foreseen everything. Stalin, too, was of the opinion that he knew everything better than anyone else did. Stalin re-introduced the tradition of the new-year's tree and in 1942 allowed the use of the tsarist army-shirts (gimnastyorka)... Lenin had despised those things. Stalin did not ascend the throne himself. It was Lenin who made him general secretary of the Central Committee, since Trotsky did not wish to be seen in this public position due to his manifestly Jewish origin. Stalin was a worthy follower of the Leninist inheritance until Lazar Kaganovich had him poisoned in 1953. Of course, Stalin was the most bloodstained tyrant in the history of humanity, but he was just following the Leninist path. Stalin was the hangman who executed Judge Lenin's sentences and carried out his plans of enslavement. Once again, it is possible to cite a corresponding order of Lenin: \"Begin a merciless campaign of terror and a war against the farmers and other bourgeois elements who are hiding an excess of grain.\" A particularly dark secret about Lenin was concealed up to the end of the 1990s. This is evident from his correspondence with his party comrade and Masonic brother Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky). Lenin wrote to Zinoviev on 1 July 1917: \"Grigori! Ci rcumstances have forced me to leave Petrograd at once... The comrades suggested a place. It is so boring to be alone... Come and join me and we will spend wonderful days together, far away from everything...\" Zinoviev wrote to Lenin: \"Dear Vova! You have not answered me. You have probably forgotten your Gershel [Grigori]. I have prepared a nice cubby-hole for us... It is a wonderful home where we will live well and 126"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"nothing will disturb our love. Travel here as soon as you can. I am waiting (or you, my little flower. Your Gershel.\" In another letter, Zinoviev wanted to be sure that Lenin was not sleeping with other men in their home. He ended his letter by sending a Marxist kiss to his Vova. He suggested that nothing should be hidden from Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya and reminded him of the first time she had caught them. (Vladislav Shumsky, \"H itlerism is Terrible, but Zionism is Worse\", Moscow, 1999, p. 47.) In this way the two Masonic brothers practised David's love for Jonathan. Perhaps this makes it easier for us to understand why the freemasons are so keen on supporting the homosexual \"liberation\". Soviet man was not allowed to be independent of the state, even in foodstuffs. Stalin made sure to finally end the possibility of this by enforcing mass-collectivisation. In this, he also followed Lenin's orders. Lenin had said that an independent farmer who had an excess of grain was a danger to the social revolution. (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", second edition, Vol. 19, p. 101.) So Stalin, like a parrot, repeated that measures must be taken against the farmer, like against the bourgeois, if he had a good harvest, to protect the social revolution. It is understandable, then, why people used to tell this joke: Radio Yerevan was asked: \"Why is there always a shortage of food in the Soviet Union?\" Radio Yerevan answered: \"Because the Winter Palace was so badly defended.\" Lenin knew that the majority of the Russian people were against his bloodthirsty party. Therefore he waged a terrible war against this people to enslave it by means of fair but meaningless slogans. His successor continued this dreadful war, but used different methods. Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin knew that the untalented Stalin would follow his directions to the letter. It was also Lenin who created the problems between different nations. In February 1921 he handed over the Armenian Kars and Ardagan to Turkey in exchange for the town of Batumi. Stalin could not give Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaidjan without Lenin's permission. Lenin did not make a secret of the fact that he, like leading Turkish Jews, disliked the Armenians. The ungrateful Lenin even persecuted his allies, especially the Social Revolutionaries on the left, who were prepared to support him in all kinds 127"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"of ways and entered his government in December 1917. Lenin ordered their leader, Maria Spiridonova, imprisoned half a year after his seizure of power. Stalin had her executed in 1941. Many of those who helped Lenin came to very bad ends. Lenin's Last Days Lenin's journey through life ended very tragically. The circumstances surrounding his death have been carefully concealed. It was officially claimed that he suffered from constant headaches as a result of a bullet wound, caused by Fanny Kaplan, due to which he could never sleep properly. This was claimed for the last time by Chazov, the Soviet minister of health, in the periodical Ogonyok No. 42, 1988. This lie was actually exposed by Pravda itself, in number 18, 1929, where the Latvian Bolshevik Janis Berzins-Ziemelis told about his meeting with Lenin in 1906. He said, among other things: \"Vladimir Ulyanov suffered from headaches and sleeplessness even then. That was why he got up late and was nearly always in a bad mood.\" So Lenin suffered from headaches even 12 years before the attempt on his life. It was less known at the time that Lenin also suffered from constant pain in his eyes which, according to Vladimir Soloukhin, pointed to a problem with his brain. On the evening of the 12th of December 1922, Felix Dzerzhinsky told Lenin that his Jewish representative Theodor Rothstein could no longer take out the Party's money from the bank account in Switzerland. All of the code numbers had been changed and the money had been transferred to three new accounts with new codes. This money had, in part, been used for the infiltration of Europe's nations. Lenin had ordered Maxim Litvinov and Theodor Rothstein to build a net of infiltrators throughout Europe as early as 1917. That was why \"the Party's\" diamonds had been sold in England all the time... Only the money in Lenin's personal accounts remained. Lenin was extremely upset. On the following day - the 13th of December - he suffered from a second, but more intensive, stroke. On December 16th, 1922, when Lenin had barely recovered, he gave the order to be driven from his villa in Gorky (near Moscow) to the Kremlin, where he rested. He did not listen to the protests of doctors and 128"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"relatives. In the Kremlin, Lenin discovered that someone had made a thorough search of his office, had opened his filing cabinet and ransacked it, taking secret documents, details of code numbers, check books, letters of authorisation, and several foreign passports. His fit of rage led to another stroke, lasting about 30 minutes, on the same night. The circumstances of Lenin's new stroke were kept secret by the Com- munist Party until the historian Igor Bunich revealed them in his book \"The Party's Gold\" (St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 94). Lenin eventually broke down both phy sically and mentally. During the year preceding his death, he was in a constant state of total decay. The third and worst stroke leading to a cerebral haemorrhage came on the 9th of March 1923, when he practically lost the power of speech. One may ask: how did he finish his writing projects? There are histo- rians who plainly say that the last writings were authored by Leon Trotsky. I do not wish to think about all the atrocities which the inhuman and bloodthirsty Lenin might have committed had he been in better health. Trotsky intimated, in his infamous article of 1939, that Stalin might have poisoned Lenin. It is true that Lenin asked Stalin for poison following the first stroke on the 26th of May 1922. Stalin told the Politburo about this and they postponed the item from the agenda. It is now clear that Stalin did not poison Lenin. In 1991 it was still claimed officially that Lenin suffered from blood clots in hardened brain arteries. These blood clots affected vital areas of the brain. In June 1992, it was made official in Moscow that Lenin died from syphilis (Aftonbladet, July 23, 1992). The Central Institute for Marxism-Leninism released thorough notes, which Lenin's sister Maria had kept during the last months of Lenin's life. According to her, Lenin contracted syphilis in Paris in 1902. Lenin's headaches became especially severe in 1922. He also suffered from gastric catarrh and fits of uncontrolled rage. Finally, he was paralysed. The facts about his syphilis were classified. Leon Trotsky nevertheless stated that Lenin died of syphilis. (Leon Trotsky, \"Portraits: Political and Personal\", New York, 1984, p. 211.) According to the Soviet mythological propaganda, Lenin had led a most exemplary family life. At an early stage, Viktor Chernov, one of the leaders of the Social Revolutionaries, revealed some of the details about Lenin's intimate life. The myth was crushed completely in 129"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"1960 when a sensational book was published in France \"Lenin and the Brothels\", in which it was revealed that Lenin was extremely obsessed with sex. That was why he hated Plato so intensely. Some French journalists had visited the brothels in Paris which Lenin had frequented. Old prostitutes were interviewed about Lenin's sexual habits. It was during this period that Lenin contracted syphilis. In 1991, it was for the first time revealed in Russia that the leader of the \"world proletariat\" frequently visited brothels to satisfy his sexual appetites when his wife and two lovers weren't enough. Officially, Lenin had reached the highest stage of human evolution. How does that fit in with his interest in the lowest level of sexual culture? The Bolshevik Party called on several famous German doctors and asked them to examine Lenin. The German doctors all made the same diagnosis - syphilis. This was not popular with the Party leadership, so the 76-year-old Jewish professor Salomon Eberhard Henschen, a brain expert from Stockholm, was invited to Moscow. He travelled together with his son, Folke Henschen who was a professor in pathology. They both made a satisfactory diagnosis: aterioscleros is. (Dagens Nyheter, August 23, 1992.) The authorities dared to reveal the truth only in July 1992. In 1923, Lenin could only shout incoherent words and phrases: \"The revolution... Help me... the people... go to hell.\" He screamed loudly, shook with tears and sighed desperately. {Dagens Nyheter, August 23, | 1992.) Normally, he could only say: \"Just now... Just now...\" At Christmas 1923, only a few weeks before his death, Lenin sat on his balcony and howled at the full moon like a wolf (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 95). Photographs taken in the autumn of 1923 outside Lenin's villa in Gorky were released in 1992. These show without embellishment what the sick Lenin, his right side paralysed, looked like. On the 21st of January 1924, at around six in the evening, Lenin's temperature rose to 42.3°C. There was no space left at the top of the thermometer to show any more. In his final spasms, he drooled in German \"Weiter, weiter!\" He died at six thirty. All the material about the examination of Lenin's brain was kept secret and further studies in the matter were stopped. This was revealed by the journalist Artyom Borovik.

The other hemisphere was covered with such thick calcium deposits that it was perfectly impossible to understand how Lenin had survived his last years, and the question arose: why had he not died as a child? Yuri Annenkov claimed in 1966 in his book \"The Diary of My Meetings\" (New York), that he managed to get a glimpse of Lenin's brain - the left hemisphere was very wrinkly, disfigured and shrunken. The doctors reached a consensus that it was impossible for a human being to live with such a brain. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 75.) But was Lenin really a normal human being? In conclusion, it may be said that Lenin's brain was seriously ill from his birth, but that there occurred, almost miraculously, a certain compen- sation for the damage. However, this allowed very little margin for sur- viving a progressing syphilitic attack on the brain. A gruesome idea appears, namely that a certain disease of the brain might destroy such higher spiritual functions as make us human, but leave intact the kind of robotic intelligence which is necessary for an instrument in the service of evil powers. To make matters worse, Lenin's diet consisted almost exclusively of white bread. This means that he suffered from a severe deficiency of the minerals and vitamins needed for his body and mind to function properly. He knew nothing about nourishment. (Ogonyok, No. 39, October, 1997.) Even Lenin's younger brother, Dmitri Ulyanov suffered from a brain disease. He became an infamous mass-murderer in the Crimea in his struggle for Soviet power during 1917-21. He finally went insane and became totally paralysed. He died on the 17th of July 1943 in Gorky at 68 years of age. The architect Alexei Shchusev (1873-1949), who designed Lenin's mausoleum, used the central altar from the Satanist temple in Pergamon as a prototype. The German national socialists had transferred the original to Berlin in 1944, from where it was transported to Moscow one year later. (Alexei Shchusev's article \"Den oforglomliga kvallen\" / \"The Unforget- table Evening\", Svenska Dagbladet, January 27, 1948.) This, too, was a state secret. The newspaper SN wrote on May 14, 1981, that the Satanists' central altar was in Lenin's mausoleum. 132"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Finally, the secrets which have lain under the shadow of Pluto, have begun to come to light. Those who were afraid society would fall apart altogether if the truth became known, were right. Those who claimed that evil Communism could not be reformed were also right. This is another reason why Lenin hated neutral and honest historians. When Maxim Gorky begged him to spare the life of Prince Nikolai Mikhailovich, who was an historian, Lenin answered: \"The revolution needs no historians.\" (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 47.) In 1990, the demolition of the Lenin monuments in Poland, Hungary, Georgia, the Baltic states and other European countries began. The first and last president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, intervened. On the 14th of October 1990, he issued a decree prohibiting the removal or destruction of Lenin statues and other monuments to communism. Gorbachev described overthrowing Lenin monuments as acts \"incom- patible with... respect for the history of the fatherland and generally acceptable morals\". Gorbachev's decree to protect the Lenin monuments was to no avail. The destruction continued. When the Lenin monument in Lvov (the Ukraine) was removed, the cheers ceased abruptly when it was discovered that Lenin had stood upon Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish graves. Quite symbolic, was it not? (Dagens Nyheter, 17th October 1990.) The last Lenin monuments in Estonia were demolished on the 21st of December 1993 in Narva, which had been colonised by Bolshevik- sympathising Russians. They kept it as a guardian angel for their unjust plans against independent Estonia. Still Lenin remains here and there in Russia and Cuba and in Asia, especially in China, but also in Calcutta. The Communists have been in power in this Indian city for 22 years. They still believe Marxism- Leninism to be the only answer to the economic and political problems of the poor. {Dagens Nyheter, January 26, 1993.) On the 1st of April 1991, I saw how someone had scrawled a nearly symbolic text on a wall in Sevilla in Spain: \"Without Marxism-Leninism, there would be no Communism in the world today!\" The supercentralised system, which Lenin founded, has now fallen to pieces. Lenin brought nothing good to Russia. History has already passed judgement on Vladimir Ulyanov, a grand master in the service of darkness and falsehood. When will people understand and accept this judgement? 133"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"LEON TROTSKY - CYNIC AND SADIST Leon Trotsky was born with the name of Leiba Bronstein on the 25th October (the 7th of November in the Gregorian calendar) 1879 at 10:09 p.m. in the village of Yanovka near Bobrinets in the province of Kherson in the Ukraine. It is asserted by some foreign sources that he came into the world on the 26th of October. Dmitri Volkogonov, however, settled for the 25th in his book \"Trotsky\". The Julian calendar, in which the new year began 13 days later than in the Gregorian, was used in Russia before the Bolshevik revolution. Leiba's father, David Bronstein, was a wealthy Jewish landowner. In fact, the Bronstein family owned the whole village. In 1888, when Leiba was 7 years old, he began attending a Jewish Heder school, where the studies were conducted in Hebrew. (Dmitri Volkogonov, \"Trotsky\", Moscow, 1994, I, p. 31.) The children at this Jewish school also studied the Talmud. According to the Talmud, the Jews are God's chosen people who are to play a leading role in the world. In 1911 the Jews had 43 such schools in Odessa alone, a town in which 36.4 per cent of the population was Jewish in 1926. Leiba began collecting pornographic pictures at the age of eight. In 1888 Leiba began at St. Paul's junior secondary school in Odessa, but he finished his last year in Nikolaievsk, where he was presented to a Czech Jew, Franz Schwigowsky who recruited the 17-year-old Leiba into a secret society - \"The Workers' League\". The members of \"The League\", in- cluding Leiba Bronstein, were imprisoned on the 28th of January 1898. He was imprisoned in Odessa where he spent two years before he was exiled to Siberia for four years. On the 21st of August 1902, he escaped from Siberia. First he went to Vienna, where he at once found the Jewish \"revolutionary\" and freemason Viktor Adler, who published the news- paper Arbeiter-Zeitung (Workers' Newspaper). Then his journey to London was arranged. The man who transformed Leiba Bronstein into a revolutionary monster under the name of Leon (Lev) Trotsky, was a high ranking Jewish 134"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Illuminatus and freemason, Israel Helphand, who had, in a fit of self irony, assumed the somewhat ironic name of Alexander Parvus (Alexander the Small). The way in which Helphand came into contact with Bronstein has not been revealed, even by the very latest research into the matter. It might be presumed that he met Parvus through Lenin, whom he met in the autumn of 1902 in London. It was in 1902 that Bronstein began to call himself Trotsky. Leiba Bronstein first regarded Pavel Axelrod, and later Parvus as his mentor and guide. He never studied at any university. Western encyclo- paedias have claimed that Trotsky studied at the University of Kiev, but this was not the case. His contacts with Parvus were the only \"university\" he needed. Trotsky remained in Western Europe until January 1905, when he returned to Russia together with Parvus to organise a \"revolution\". Together with Parvus, he edited a socialist newspaper, Nachalo (The Beginning). Many embellishing myths were attac hed to Trotsky's name, especially in the West, where he was presented as a \"gigantic personality\", \"an outstanding man\", \"educated, good and kind\". These myths reached Moscow in the autumn of 1988, when Trotsky was rehabilitated after Stalin's accusations against him. It has also been claimed that everything would have been much better if Trotsky had become the General Secretary of the Central Committee. Is this true? By means of historical documents, Trotsky's own writings and other sources, I will prove the opposite. It was very lucky that Trotsky did not become head of the Communist Party. Honest historians, also in Russia, have begun to regard Trotsky as an even more terrible alternative for the leadership than Stalin. The myth about Trotsky is of course based on the propaganda for good Communism as opposed to Stalin's ev il Communism. This is why it has been stressed again and again what an elegant man Trotsky was, whilst Stalin was rough and vulgar. Trotsky was also supposed to be interested in culture. The myth around Trotsky was created mainly by himself. The historian Isaac Deutscher wrote of Trotsky's skill at deception. He could speak, ostensibly with all seriousness, about things of which he was quite ignorant. His falsification of the history of the \"Russian revolution\" is 135"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"appreciated in Sweden by the historian Kristian Gerner, among others. (Svenska Dagbladet, September 6, 1988.) Trotsky as a Freemason Mr Leiba Bronstein became a freemason in 1897 and later a high-ranking Illuminatus through his friend Alexander Parvus. He also maintained contacts with B'nai B'rith, a Jewish Masonic order, which had previously aided Jewish \"revolutionaries\" in Russia. A man named Jacob Schiff, chairman of the banking house Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and a minion of the Rothschilds, took care of the contacts between the \"revolutionary movement in Russia\" and B'nai B'rith. (Gerald B. Winrod, \"Adam Weis- haupt - A Human Devil\", p. 47.) Leiba Bronstein began to study freemasonry and the history of the secret societies seriously in 1898, and continued these studies during the two years he spent in prison in Ode ssa. He made notes amounting to over 1000 pages. \"Internationaler Freimaurer-Lexikon\" (Vienna/Munich, 1932, p. 204) reluctantly admits that Leiba Bronstein-Trotsky came to Bolshe- vism through this study of freemasonry. As a People's Commissary for Military Affairs, Trotsky introduced the pentagram - the five-pointed star - as the symbol of the Red Army. The Cabbalists had taken over this symbol of black magic from the witches in ancient Chaldea. By the aid of Alexander Parvus, Trotsky reached the conclusion that the true purpose of freemasonry was to eliminate the national states and their cultures and to introduce a Judaised world state. This is also stated in \"The Secret Initiation into the 33rd Degree\": \"Freemasonry is nothing more and nothing less than revolution in action; continuous conspiracy.\" Bronstein became a convinced internationalist who, by the agency of Parvus' care, learned that the Jewish people were their own collective Messiah and would reach dominion over all peoples through the mixing of the other races and elimination of national boundaries. An international republic was to be created, where the Jews would be the ruling element, since no others would be able to understand and control the masses.

He was already a member of the Misraim-Memphis freemasonry. Winston Churchill confirmed in 1920 that Trotsky was also an Illu- minatus. {Illustrated Sunday Herald, February 8, 1920.) Trotsky eventually reached a very high position within freemasonry, since he belonged to the Shriner Lodge, which only freemasons of the 32nd degree and higher were allowed to join. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Alexander Kerensky, Bela Kun and other leading politicians have also been among these select few. (Professor Johan von Leers, \"The Power behind the President\", Stockholm, 1941, p. 148.) Trotsky's Teacher Parvus Parvus was born in 1867 in the town of Berezino in the province of Minsk in Byelorussia, but grew up in Odessa where he finished college in 1885. He then continued his studies abroad. In 1891 he passed his final exams at the University of Basel and left as an economist and financier. He later look a doctor's degree in philosophy. He worked for several years in different banks in Germany and Switzer- land. He also became a skilful publicist who understood how perfectly the phraseology of Marxism could conceal political and war crimes. Parvus had studied the history of Russia and knew that the country would be quite helpless if the nobility and the intellectuals were eliminated. All these ideas made a great impression on Leiba Bronstein and Vladimir Ulyanov. Alexander Parvus, as a professional criminal, wanted to transform Russia into a base for international speculators and criminals who would hide under the name of \"social democrats\". Lenin believed this to be impossible since Russia was not rich enough and wanted to use Switzerland for this purpose but Trotsky agreed with Parvus. Parvus was therefore the man behind Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution. Trotsky echoed, like a parrot, that Russia must be thrown into the flames of the world revolution. 137"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" The author Maxim Gorky characterised the socialist Parvus as a miser and a swindler. He had often put the famous author's royalties in his own pocket. Once, when he did this, the German Socialist Party's honorary tribunal (Karl Kautsky, August Bebel, Klara Zetkin) condemned him morally. After this, Parvus travelled to Constantinople, where he became advisor to the Young Turks (i.e. the Jews). He mediated trade between Turkey and Germany and became exceedingly wealthy in the process. For a time he also edited the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. The Attempts at a Coup d'Etat in 1905 Parvus wrote as early as 1895 in the periodical Aus der Weltpolitik, which he himself financed, that war would break out between Russia and Japan and that the Russian revolution would be born out of this conflict. In his 138"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"series of articles \"The War and the Revolution\", published in 1904, he also predicted that Russia would lose the war against Japan. The international capitalists wanted to begin a \"revolution\" in St. Petersburg in connection with Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese war in 1904-05. The chief organiser, Alexander Parvus, received two million pounds sterling from Japan to organise the seizure of power in Russia. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 33.) The war began with a Japanese attack on Port Arthur (now Lushun) on the 9th of February 1904. It was, above all, the European banks belonging to rich Jews, which financed the Russo-Japanese war. All possibility of credit was shut off to Russia while Japan had unlimited credit. The most important Jewish loanshark, Jacob Henry Schiff in the United States of America, supported the Japanese military forces with a loan of 200 million dollars, according to Encyclopaedia Judaica. The Jerusalem Post admitted on September 9, 1976 that it had been Schiff who lent the money needed to construct the Japanese navy. Several British banks built railways in Japan and financed Japan's war against China. It was the same Jacob Schiff who made sure that no banks were permitted to lend money to the Russians. At the same time, he supported \"revolutionary\" Jewish groups in Russia. Encyclopaedia Judaica called these \"Jewish self-defence groups\". The Provisional Government was later given all possible financial aid from his banking house Kuhn, Loeb & Co and other banks. Encyclopaedia Judaica characterised Jacob Henry Schiff as a \"financier and philanthropist\". The Jewish capitalists wanted to seize power in Russia in the name of the workers. Parvus and Bronstein-Trotsky believed the time was ripe when the Russians lost Port Arthur on the 2nd of January 1905 (20th of December 1904). Parvus and Trotsky immediately began to organise major provocations, strikes and riots. The Social Revolutionaries had terrorised the nation as early as in 1904. The Zionist Socialist Workers' Party, which took part in this revolution, according to surprising information in Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971, Vol. 15, p. 657), had been formed in Odessa in January 1905 for subversive purposes. The Jews' secret society Kagal (Kahal) was also involved. The general public has never heard that a secret Jewish society that called itself Kahal (Council) had been operating in Russia since the 19h century. Its aim was to overthrow the tsarist reign. This was 139"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"confirmed by the Finnish encyclopaedia Suomen Tietosanakirja, but the Russian encyclopaedias, of course, knew nothing about it. The first major action organised by Alexander Parvus together with his Jewish comrade Peter (Pinhas) Rutenberg, was later called \"Bloody Sunday\". On the 9th (22nd) of January 1905, the freemasons Parvus and Rutenberg placed their Jewish terrorists (chiefly Social Revolutionaries) in different trees in the Alexandrovsk park and ordered them to shoot at the guards by the Winter Palace. The soldiers were forced to return fire to protect themselves. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 33.) All this has only now been revealed from the Communist Party's secret documents. The official history has up to now been an audacious lie: the soldiers in front of the Winter Palace were supposed to have opened fire on peaceful demonstrators. 150 were killed and a further 200 were wounded following this provocation. The Tsar was shocked. He gave a subsidy to the collection for the dead and their families. He even received a \"revolutionary\" delegation in a fatherly manner. The Social Revolutionaries' terror organisation was infuriated. Bloody Sunday was skilfully exploited by the \"revolutionary\" propaganda, which claimed that \"thousands of people lost their lives\". Similar myths are spread even to this day. The preparations for a national coup had begun. The Jewish terrorists Roza Brilliant, Kalyalev and others murdered the Tsar's uncle, the governor of Moscow, Grand Duke Sergei Romanov, on the 4th (17th) of February. Parvus, Trotsky and their Jewish accomplices organised and co- ordinated bank-robberies, mutinies on the armoured ships Potemkin (June 1905) and Ochakov and on a further ten warships, revolts in Kronstadt, Sevastopol and other places. The Jewish Bolshevik Leonid Krasin (actually Goldgelb, former criminal and stockbroker), together with Par- vus' bandits, committed bank-robberies, murdered policemen, bought weapons - all to destabilise Russia. This is the point where the Swedish Jew Salomon Schulman should be quoted: \"Few today think of the Jews' important role, both ideologically and practically, under the pioneering period of the socialist movements.\" (Dagens Nyheter, April 12, 1990, B 3.)

Parvus and Trotsky were given plenty of aid from the United States, where the Jewish millionaire Jacob Schiff even in 1890 organised and financed training for Jewish \"revolutionaries\" from Russia. It was B'nai B'rith (Sons of the Covenant), the Jewish Masonic organi- sation, that planned the instruction for those training courses. The same order also played an active role in the so-called revolution in 1905. (\"The Ugly Truth About the ADL\", Washington, 1992, p. 27.) Adolf Krause, Grand Master of B'nai B'rith, truthfully said to another liberal freemason, Count Sergei Witte (married to the Jewess Matilda Khotimskaya), during the Russo-Japanese peace negotiations in the summer of 1905, that the Jews would unleash a revolution on Russia if the Russian Jews were not given free hands to act. The peace treaty was signed in Portsmouth on the 5th of September (23rd August) 1905. The American financier Jacob Schiff was present. Witte described this event in his \"Memoirs\". Before this, \"revolutionary\" leaflets (printed in England) had been spread among the Russian prisoners of war and thousands of Jewish \"revolutionaries\" from the United States of America had been sent to Russia. These Russian-Jewish terrorists protected themselves with Ameri- can passports. The acts of terror, however, were so brutal that Russia refused these Russian Jews the right of American citizenship. B'nai B'rith, whose headquarters were in Chicago and whose pompous representation is evident even in Washington, was behind these acts. The organisation was founded on the 13th of October 1842 in New York by 12 Jewish men, symbolising the 12 Jewish tribes who were to rule the world. Many leading figures within this movement were militant advocates of slavery, among them Grand Master Simon Wolf. B'nai B'rith's first lodge in Europe was founded in 1885 in Berlin. There were 103 lodges in Germany in 1932. B'nai B'rith was the only Masonic organisation allowed to continue operating even under the Nazi rule. Today B'nai B'rith is the largest Jewish organisation in the world. In 1970 it had 500 000 male members spread over 1700 lodges in 43 countries and 210 000 female members in 600 lodges (Encyclopaedia Judaica). There are presently 70 established lodges in Europe. The only 141"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"lodge in Austria is called Maimonides. The organisation works to secure the power of the Jews over humanity, as revealed by the Hungarian Jew Aron Monus in his book \"Verschworung: das Reich von Nietzsche\" (Vienna, 1995, p. 149). B'nai B'rith is an executive organ for L'Alliance Israelite Uni-verselle. The official budget before 1970 was 13 million dollars. B'nai B'rith's secret service, the ADL (Anti-Defamation League), has been called the KGB of the extremist Jews. Jewish terrorists had been active in Russia already before this but in 1905 the terror assumed unprecedented proportions. The fanatics began to murder without discrimination. One of the worst terrorists was the Menshevik Vera Zasulich (1849-1919). In 1878 she murdered the mayor of St. Petersburg, Fiodor Trepov, with a large-calibre revolver but was acquitted by the court on the 31st of March 1878. Other leading Jewish terrorists were Movsha Strunsky, Feig Elkin, Roza Brilliant and Feldman. They all followed the tradition of the infamous Jewish terrorist Grigori Gershuni. The social revolutionary Gershuni was behind the murder of the Minister of the Interior, Dmitri Sipyagin (1902), the attempt on the life of Obolensky, governor of Kharkov and the murder of Ufa's governor N. Bogdanovich in Bashkiria (1903). Gershuni was sentenced to death in 1904. He was pardoned by the Tsar and given life imprisonment instead. Gershuni managed to escape. He was praised as a hero throughout Europe. Gershuni's right hand was Yevno Azef (1869-1918), the son of a Jewish tailor. It was often he who planned the murders performed by the Social Revolutionaries' terrorist section. Yevno Azef was involved in several important plots, among others the one against Vyacheslav Plehve, the Minister of the Interior, who was murdered on the 28th of June 1904. (Carroll Quigley, \"Tragedy and Hope\", New York, 1966, p. 99.) Azef had already managed to infiltrate the police as an agent of the Social Revo- lutionaries in 1892, but never revealed the murderous plans of the terrorists since he knew the intentions of the police. He was eventually forced into double-crossing both sides. In 1908, the social revolutionary central committee discovered that Azef had betrayed his own comrades who then decided to kill him, but he managed to escape abroad. On the 7th (20th) of October 1905, all the trains stopped. On the 8th of October, St. Petersburg was paralysed by a general strike which spread to other large cities on the 12th (25th) of October. Power stations, banks, 142"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"restaurants and hospitals were closed. No newspapers were published. Nothing worked. Agitated masses crowded in all the large cities, waving red flags and standing on street corners, listening to Jewish speakers who demanded an end to the tsarist regime. Already in April 1905, Trotsky had released a leaflet encouraging the people to overthrow the Tsar. Trotsky had returned from Switzerland in January 1905, but his activities with the subversive movements reached their peak precisely in October. The Tsar's advisor, Sergei Witte, demanded on the 9th (22nd) of Octo- ber that Nicholas II should either summon the Parliament, the Duma, and have him named Prime Minister or have to use force against the masses. The Tsar followed this advice and Witte became Prime Minister on the same day. Parvus and Trotsky founded the first Kahal, which was called soviet in Russian, on the 13th (26th) of October 1905. This soviet began with 40 council members, all of whom dreamed of seizing power. All \"revolutio- nary\" activity was co-ordinated from this Jewish organisational centre, which was camouflaged as a workers' council. The chairman at the beginning was the Jew Peter Khrustalyev (Georgi Nosar). His closest collaborators were Leon Trotsky and Alexander Parvus. The other leading members were neither poor peasants nor workers, but Jewish conspirators and freemasons: Grever, Edilken, Go ldberg, A Simanovsky, A. Feif, Matzelev, Bruser and others. These people were supposedly representing the Russian working class, despite the fact that no one had elected them. Trotsky believed the Soviets to be an excellent means with which to continue the traditions of the Paris Commune. He hoped to win power for himself through the chaos they caused. Parvus and Trotsky continued to feed the flames of the general strike and the resultant national chaos though their secret network. The instigators actually believed the tsarist regime was about to break down. The soviet had intended to keep the general strike going as long as possible, but the workers' eagerness to revolt faded away. The agitators no longer had the people behind them. The Tsar also announced a manifesto on the 17th (30th) of October, in which he promised that suffrage would be broadened and that the legislative power would be divided between the parliament and govern- ment. The people began to calm down. Trotsky, who had his 26th birthday on the 25th of October (November 7th), was deeply disappointed. The attempt to take power had failed. 143"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" The leaders of the revolution in 1905. From the left: Alexander Parvus, Leon Trotsky and Leon Deutsch with other Jewish conspirators. This photograph was a state secret. The Masonic Jews fumed with anger and eagerly began to use the power of the Soviets in other cities. Moisei Uritsky became the leader of the soviet in Krasnoyarsk in December 1905, according to The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia. Peasants were provoked to plunder their estates in November-December (just like in France in July of 1789). It was Lenin, according to the myth, who led the preparations for an armed revolt in November 1905. But he was actually still abroad, according to Stanislav Govorukhin's documentary film \"The Russia We Lost\". Parvus, Trotsky and Deutsch led the revolt. Nosar was arrested and Trotsky became soviet leader on the 26th of November. A week later (3rd December) he was arrested together with 300 other soviet members. Parvus immediately organised a strike. Trotsky was exiled to Siberia for life. Parvus re-established his soviet almost straight away, on the 7th (20th) December, and named himself the last chairman of the group. On the same day, Parvus had organised a major strike in the capital, in which 90 000 workers took part. 150 000 went on strike in Moscow on the following day. There were riots in other cities too. The leader of the rabble who 144"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"attacked Moscow on the 9th of December was the Jew Zinovi Litvin- Scdoy (actually Zvulin Yankelev). The Moscow soviet had prohibited all non-socialist newspapers on the 7th of December. The bloody riots went on for nine days. The Tsar had no other alternative than to use force against the plundering and terrorising mob. The major troubles were finally put down on the 12th of January 1906. Parvus was among those arrested and was exiled to Siberia, but escaped before he reached his destination. 14 000 strikes in total were organised in Russia in 1905. Three million workers took part. The agitators were everywhere Jews, who skilfully exploited the defeat in the war against Japan. People soon understood this and the reaction was not slow in coming. The battle-cry of the pogroms between the 18th and the 20th of October went: \"Beat up the Jews!\" Jewish shops, where prices had been exorbitant, were plundered and burnt down. 810 Jews were killed. This was hardly surprising since the leading contributions in this attempt at a national coup had come from the Zionist Socialist Workers' Party, the Kahal and the Jewish socialist parties The Sickle, Bund and Po'alei Zion. The last-named organisation alone contributed 25 000 terrorists to the struggle to overthrow the Tsar. The Sickle had been founded for the purpose of taking part in the actions of 1905. The organisation was dissolved in February 1917. Isaac Deutscher explained that the anti-Semitic attitude was caused chiefly by the deceptions of the Jewish shop-owners. According to the Soviet Zionists' official (exaggerated) reports, 4000 Jews were killed during the pogroms in Russia between 1905 and 1907. (Obozrenie, Paris, November 1985, p. 36.) 20 000 people were killed or crippled as a result of the terrorist actions in the years 1905-06, according to the film director Stanislav Govorukhin. Novoye Vremya put the total figure at 50 000 in March 1911. Both Parvus and Trotsky began to understand that all these sporadic terrorist actions would not be enough to support and decisively change the outcome of the coup attempts in October (when the all-out political strike was organised and terrorist actions were staged), December 1905, and in January 1906, when the last, desperate attempt to overthrow the Tsar's regime was made. Lenin, who sceptically followed the events in Russia from his exile, came to the same conclusion. Mass terror was needed for a victory. The \"revolutionaries\" dreamed of civil war. 145"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"On the 11th of April 1906, Peter Rutenberg (1879-1942) hanged the priest and trade unionist Georgi Gapon who had carried the petition on Bloody Sunday. He knew too much and was killed as a traitor and police agent. The Tsar named Peter Stolypin Minister of the Interior in April 1906 and soon afterwards he was appointed Prime Minister. Stolypin eventually brought an end to the terror and the \"revolution\". He had no choice but to enforce martial law to frighten and combat the terrorists. Only those who had committed murder were executed after being court-martialled. 600 terrorists were court-martialled and executed in 1906. Most of the \"revolutionaries\" (35 000) fled abroad - mostly to Palestine (Isaac Deutscher, \"Den ojudiske juden\" / \"The un-Jewish Jew\", Stockholm, 1969, p. 119), but also to Sweden, the United States of America and other countries. Peter Stolypin had control of the situation from June 1907. Another 2328 terrorists were executed in the years 1907-08. How many Russians owed him their lives? Russia began to recover after the atrocities of Leon Trotsky and Alexander Parvus. The dark fo rces disliked this new turn of events. Peter Stolypin's house was subjected to a bomb attack immediately after his nomination in the spring of 1906. The victims were visitors - 27 killed and 32 wounded - the explosion was terrible. Among the victims was the son of the Prime Minister. His daughter was thrown out of the house by the force of the explosion and landed in front of some horsedrawn wagons. She was lame for the rest of her life. Stolypin was not at home at the time of the attack. This assault on Apothecary Island in St. Petersburg was the last spasm of the terror. Stolypin, meanwhile, was well aware that the instigators of the country's troubles were Masonic Jews. Peter Stolypin's reforms were thorough. A new constitution was written up in which the peasants were given full freedom. Stolypin introduced a land reform, which gave the peasants the right to take out state loans in order to buy their own farms. Two million peasants became independent farmers between 1907 and 1914 and 23 percent became landowners. The peasants were freed from income tax. Electricity and telephones were installed in the villages of Altai. Stolypin oversaw the building of schools and hospitals in the country. 146"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"A health insurance policy was introduced in 1912, all in keeping with previous plans. The newspapers were a llowed to publish what they wan- ted. All political parties were permitted. Both the army and navy were modernised. Jewish \"revolutionaries\" realised that they would never be able to take over Russia if this was allowed to continue. Jewish funda- mentalists raged against these reforms which gave Russia's agricultural proletariat land and freedom. The British political scientist Bernard Pares also admitted that \"the seven-year period 1907-14 must from an economic viewpoint without doubt be seen as the best in all Russian history\". During this period the peasants came into possession of three quarters of the land. That was why the secret Masonic forces worked ever more eagerly to halt this positive development. The Jews had great influence in Russia - they dominated the banks and the oil and sugar industries. The Jewish lawyer Dmitri Stasov was of a 147 "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"noble family and became the first chairman of the Russian Lawyers' Association in St. Petersburg. His daughter, Yelena, became an infamous Bolshevik murderess and Lenin's lover. There were 3567 Jewish nobles in Russia in 1904, yet they have tried to distort history, asserting that the Jews in Russia were without any rights and were the victims of constant pogroms. Only Catherine II, the Great, had actually tried to reduce the secret influence of the Jews. Afterwards everything continued as usual. It became prohibited in the Soviet Union to show the famous painting where Catherine II treads on the serpent (symbolising Judaism). Before the October coup, 37 per cent of the Jewish population of 6.1 million worked with trade and commerce. On average, the Jews had a better education than others. It might be mentioned that half the students in the Ukraine were Jews. That was why the Jews held 87 per cent of the best positions whilst only making up 4.2 per cent of the population. Of course, they had all officially joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Many Jews held very high posts, among these was the Senator and Minister of Justice Vladimir Sabler (Desyatovsky, 1845-1929), Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Boris Sturmer (1848-1917), and the Ministry of Justice's Chancellor Nikolai Neklyudov (1840-1896). Twelve Jewish members were elected to the Duma after the attempted coup in 1905. But the extremist Jews still dreamed of total control over the Russian society. 50 000 of the Jews were workers (not even 1 per cent). It would be interesting to find out how many Jewish workers there are in Russia today. Russia exhibited an impressive surplus of grain during Stolypin's tenure. After his reforms, Russia began producing more grain than the United States of America, Canada and Argentina put together. Finally, Russia produced 40 per cent of the world's grain and was called the world's granary. This was unpopular with the international financial elite. Stolypin, being a liberal, also worked to further improve the position of the Jews, according to Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Stolypin was a sensible man who knew that there was only a small group of fanatics among the Jews in Russia, who unfortunately committed terrible crimes and acted in the name of all Jews. Even according to Lenin's own (naturally reduced) data, there were 33 000 socialist \"revolutionaries\" of Jewish stock in Russia in 1906. (Lenin, \"Works\", 4th edition, Vol. 2, p. 168.) Stolypin wanted to 148"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"widen the Jews' choice of career in order to draw them away from Socialism. At 9 o'clock on the evening of the 1st (14th) of September 1911, Prime Minister Peter Stolypin was wounded by the Jewish terrorist Mordekai (Dmitri) Bogrov (who was a social revolutionary) at the opera in Kiev. This occurred in the middle act of Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Tsar Saltan\" in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II. Bogrov shot Stolypin twice with a pistol at point-blank range. Stolypin raised his left hand - the right was pierced - and made the sign of the cross towards the Tsar. Prime Minister Peter Stolypin died four days later. The student Dmitri (Mordekai) Bogrov was the son of a rich Jew who owned a large house in Kiev. {Molodaya Gvardiya, No. 8, 1990, p. 232.) At first, people tried to lynch the terrorist, but the police saved him. Leon Trotsky had met the murderer Bogrov on the morning of 1 September 1911 in Kiev. The inhabitants of Kiev wanted to beat all the Jews to death after the murder of Prime Minister Peter Stolypin, but the government sent a regiment of Cossacks to stop the bloodbath. (\"The War by Base Law\", Minsk, 1999, p. 42.) The Masonic Jews had attempted to murder Stolypin a total of ten times. Bogrov succeeded on the eleventh attempt. The \"revolutionaries\" were pleased. Lenin heard the news in his exile and was elated. The historian V. Startsev pointed out that tsarism lost its most gifted defender when Stolypin died. The social revolutionary and freemason Alexander Kerensky (actually Aaron Kiirbis) fled abroad after the murder, since he had had a close co-operation with the murderer Mordekai Bogrov. The same Kerensky became Russia's Prime Minister in July 1917. It was extremely important for the Masonic Jews to bring the reforms to an end. Leon Trotsky admitted that, if the reforms had been brought through completely, the Russian proletariat would have been unable to reach power. (L. Trotsky, \"The History of the Russian Revolution\", London, 1967, Vol. 1, p. 64.) When he said \"the Russian proletariat\" he meant the Masonic Jews. To safeguard the Masonic plans and to thwart Russia's positive development, a setback was then arranged through the United States government. In December 1911 the American president William Howard Taft nullified the Russo-American trade agreement. Congress was almost unanimous (only one vote against was registered)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Trotsky Abroad Neither Trotsky nor Parvus stayed in Siberia. Both escaped. Parvus ended up in Turkey where he became a businessman. Trotsky escaped on the 20th of February 1907 and lived first in Vienna and later in Geneva where he occasionally discussed the prospects of Jewry with the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann. Parvus supported both Lenin and Trotsky financially. They were even allowed to live with Parvus in Munich for a short period. Lenin also regarded Parvus as his teacher, though he eventually came to hate him. Parvus became especially rich during the Balkan War (1912-13). He dealt in anything from grain to condoms. On his coal deals alone he made 32 million Danish crowns in gold. Lenin and Trotsky took part in a Masonic conference in Copenhagen in 1910, where the possibilities of socialising Europe were discussed. (Franz Weissin, \"Der Weg zum Sozia- lismus\" / \"The Way to Socialism\", Munich, 1930, p. 9.) In 1912, Trotsky worked as a war correspondent in the Balkans during 1912. It was Parvus who had arranged this opportunity for him. During the First World War Trotsky lived in France but he eventually acted against the interests of that country. He had, among other things, published agitatory articles in the exile newspaper Nashe Slovo, which he had founded together with L. Martov (Julius Zederbaum). On the 15th of September 1916, the newspaper was suppressed and on the following day Trotsky was deported to Spain. A few days later he was arrested in Madrid. He was sent to Cadiz, then to Barcelona, where he was put on board the steamship Monserrat and sent away to the United States of America. He landed in New York on January 13, 1917. Many of his Jewish collabo- rators (Grigori Chudnovsky, Moisei Uritsky and others) had also made their way to New York. In New York, Trotsky wrote a few odd articles for an insignificant little Marxist newspaper Novy Mir, which had been founded by his Jewish com- rades Mikhail Weinstein and Brailovsky. Nikolai Bukharin (actually Dolgolevsky) worked in the editorial office, together with V. Volodarsky (actually Moisei Goldstein) and other Jews. Trotsky also gave a few lectures. Despite the fact that the newspaper could pay no normal royalties, Trotsky and his family liv ed in a luxurious house in the Bronx 150"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"(with the rent paid three months in advance). A free limousine with a chauffeur was given to him and his family to use (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 22). Trotsky officially went to the United States to prepare the organisation of the \"workers' revolution\" in Russia. (Robert Payne, \"The Life and Death of Trotsky\", London, 1978.) He met several Jewish communist- anarchists in New York (Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman and others). In the archives of the State Department there is a document, No. 861.00/5339, which reveals how Jacob Schiff, who was a very influential person within the Masonic organisation B'nai B'rith, and his companions Felix Warburg, Otto Kahn, Mortimer Schiff, Isaac Seligman and others had made plans as early as 1916 to overthrow the Russian Tsar. In April 1917 Jacob Schiff himself officially confirmed that it was through his financial aid to the revolutionaries that the Tsar had been forced to abdicate, whereupon a Masonic government came into power (Gary Allen, \"None Dare Call it Conspiracy\", 1971). At the same time, Alexander Kerensky received one million dollars from Jacob Schiff. (Encyclopedia of Jewish Knowledge, article \"Schiff, New York, 1938.) In the spring of 1917, Jacob Schiff began to finance Leon Trotsky to implement \"the second phase of the revolution\", according to Dr Antony C. Sutton. Colonel Edward M. House, a powerful Illuminatus in America, saw to it that President Woodrow Wilson quickly had an American passport issued for Trotsky, so that he could go back to Russia and continue the \"revolution\". In New York, on the 27th of March 1917, the 37-year-old Trotsky, with his family and 275 international te rrorists and adventurers embarked on the ship Kristianiajjord bound for Europe to complete the \"revolution\" in Russia. Various criminals, Jewish-American communists and brokers from Wall Street also accompanied them. There were some Dutchmen on board as well, according to the American communist Lincoln Steffens. They were the only ones on board who had nothing to do with the journey to Russia. On April 3, 1917, as Kristianiajjord stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Canadian border police arrested Leon Trotsky, his wife and his two children as well as five other \"Russian socialists\" (Nikita Mukhin, Leiba lishelev, Konstantin Romanenko, Grigori Chudnovsky, Gerson Meli- 151"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"chansky). The Canadians believed that Trotsky was German, since he spoke German better than Russian. He knew no English. Trotsky's close comrades Volodarsky and Uritsky stayed on board. Trotsky was arrested because of a telegram, which had been sent from London on the 29th of March 1917. It revealed that Bronstein-Trotsky and his socialist companions were on their way to Russia to start a revolution against the government. Trotsky had been given 10 000 dollars by the Germans for this purpose. (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 28.) Indeed, upon searching Trotsky, the police found 10 000 dollars. He explained that the money came from the Germans but had no further comment on the matter. The Canadians suspected Trotsky of collaboration with the Germans. Dr D. M. Coulter informed Major General Willoughby Gwatkin at the Department of Defence in Ottawa that \"these men have been hostile to Russia because of the way the Jews have been treated\". The British authorities were informed that the German General Staff from 1915 had financed Kerensky, Lenin and some other Russian citizens on. But it also appears that Trotsky received money from this source as early as 1916. The Canadian military secret service was convinced that Leiba Bronstein was acting on German instructions. Suddenly a counter-order to release Leiba Bronstein and his cronies came from the British Embassy in Washington. The Embassy had received a demand from the Department of State in Washington to release Bronstein-Trotsky as an American citizen with an American passport. Washington demanded that the Canadians should help Bronstein in any way possible. So powerful were his friends! According to American explanations, it was Kerensky who wanted to have Trotsky released. Trotsky was actually released five days later. The Canadians apologised for interrupting Trotsky's journey. Later, everything possible was done to hide the facts from the Canadian public (especially after 1919), since t he authorities knew that they had, through releasing Trotsky, prolonged the world war for almost one year, according to MacLean. The Canadian government is therefore responsible for the unnecessary deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians. But the truth always comes to light sooner or later. All these documents in the Canadi an national archives are now available to researchers. 152"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"In this way we can see that Stalin's accusations against Trotsky had some foundation. Trotsky was then accused of having worked as a paid agent on behalf of international capitalism. The Canadian documents now released show that this accusation was quite correct. Later we shall see how Trotsky consciously served Germany's interests and thereby harmed Russia. Winston Churchill's article \"Zionism Versus Bolshevism\" was published on the 8th of February 1920 in the Illustrated Sunday Herald, where he stated that Trotsky belonged to the same Jewish conspiracy which had begun with Spartacus-Weishaupt. Trotsky as a Merciless Despot The Menshevik Leon Trotsky arrived in Petrograd via Sweden and Finland on the 4th of May 1917. In the beginning of July he became a Bolshevik to prepare the take-over of power together with Lenin, despite the fact that Lenin had characterised him as a swine in the same year. Jewish extremists streamed into Russia from all directions. In Petrograd, they immediately began to give out newspapers, periodicals and books in Yiddish and Hebrew. After Trotsky, another 8000 Jewish revolutionaries arrived, speaking Yiddish among themselves . They were mostly young people. After coming to power, Trotsky became Lenin's right-hand man. It was actually Trotsky who ruled Russia during Lenin's illness. He mercilessly paused the people suffering of a magnitude the world had never seen before. In the beginning Trotsky wanted to use the guillotine to execute people, but was scolded for this idea. He was a cynic and a sadist of the worst sort. He often executed his victims personally. He murdered his hostages in the cruellest manner and even ordered children killed. He ordered disciplinary executions. There are plenty of documents about these cruelties preserved in the archives of the Communist Party. The Masonic Jew Leon Trotsky spoke to his fellow criminals (\"revolutionaries\") in Petrograd, in December 1917. Among other things, he said the following: \"We must turn her (Russia) into a desert populated by white Negroes upon whom we shall in flict such a tyranny as none of the most dreadful despots of the East have ever dreamt of. 153"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The only difference is that this tyranny will not come from the right, but from the left, and will not be white, but red, in the literal sense of that word, for we shall shed such streams of blood that all the losses of human lives in Capitalist wars will shrink and pale before them. The biggest bankers on the other side of the Atlantic will work in very close collaboration with us. If we win the Revolution, crush Russia, we shall consolidate the power of Zionism on her funereal remains and become such a force that the whole world will go down on its knees before it. We will show what real power is. Using terror, blood-baths, we will reduce the Russian intelligentsia to a complete idiocy, to a bestial condition... And meanwhile, our youth in leather jackets -the sons of watchmakers from Odessa and Orsha, Gomel and Vinnitsa, oh how magnificently, how rapturously they are able to hate everything Russian! With what enjoyment they are annihilating the Russian intelligentsia - officers, engineers, teachers, priests, generals, aca- demicians, writers...\" (Aaron Simanovich, \"Memoirs\", Paris, 1922, Molodaya Gvardiya, Moscow, No. 6, 1991, p. 55.) Some notes of elucidation to the above. \"Our youth in leather jackets\" refers to members of the Cheka, mainly Jews, who wore such jackets and were armed with revolvers. The four towns mentioned were within the so- called Jewish Pale in western Russia (now the Ukraine and Byelorussia). An Israeli authority notes: \"Until 1939, the population of many Polish towns east of the river Bug was at least 90 per cent Jewish, and this demographic phenomenon was even more pronounced in that area of Tsarist Russia annexed from Poland and known as the Jewish Pale.\" (Israel Shahak, \"Jewish History, Jewish Religion - The Weight of Three Thousand Years\", London, 1994, p. 62.) It was Trotsky who founded the Red Army. He used especially gruesome methods for this purpose, according to the Jewess Dora Shturman's book \"The Dead Grasp after the Living\" (London, 1982). Trotsky had young peasants taken from their farms by force and coerced them into new careers as red soldiers, giving orders to shoot all who resisted. With such criminal methods he formed the so-called voluntary Red Army which \"fought with great honour against landowners and capitalists and won\", as the Soviet history books said. Not a word was mentioned about the American instructors Trotsky called in to help train his soldiers. 154"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"In March 1918 he had 300 000 soldiers at his disposal. Two years later he already had a million. He finally m anaged to train and equip an army of five million men. He registered all the officers and their families. If any officer betrayed the Reds or went over to the Whites, his family was taken hostage and the traitor was warned they would be killed if the Whites did not deliver him at once. Officers and their families were also executed for disobeying orders. Lenin's and Trotsky's cruelty and mercilessness became the guiding star for the Soviet government. According to the record of the 11th Party Congress in the spring of 1922, Trotsky said the following about his coercion of soldiers into his army: \"We took Red Guards straight from the villages, gave them weapons, sometimes from the carriage door; sometimes the weapons were in another wagon, and then they received their weapons later, when they arrived and stepped out of the carriage. They spent two-three weeks, sometimes a week, in the reserves, later they were subjected to iron-hard diiscipline by the aid of commissars, tribunals and punishment groups, since we had to send out untrained men. It is true that we made some agitation campaigns, if we could, but quickly, under fire, under the pressure of a hundred atmospheres.\" (\"Records and Stenographic Notes from the Congresses and Conferences of the Communist Party\", p. 289.) Trotsky had \"guilty\" people executed for the most trifling \"offences\". He himself used to be the \"principal witness\" at these mock trials. In her book, the Jewess Dora Shturman called those methods \"organised and legalised banditry\". It was Trotsky who demanded that the dictatorship of the proletariat should use its true name, the dictatorship of the Bolshevik Party. This was not done for demagogic reasons. Encouraged by Trotsky, the Krasnaya Gazeta revealed the primary goal of the Soviet regime on the 31st of August 1919: \"Already streams of bourgeois blood flow - but more blood! As much as possible!\" Even during the civil war in 1920, Trotsky began to make plans for the militarisation of the economy, to bring it into line with War Communism. He needed militarised slaves. Peasants and workers would have the same status as mobile soldiers and form \"work-units comparable to military units\" (work battalions) and be put under commanders. Each individual was a \"soldier of work who cannot be his own master - if ordered to 155"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"move, he must obey; if he refuses, he will be a deserter who must be punished\" (usually with death). All this was presented at the 9th Party Congress in March-April 1920, according to the record. Trotsky emphasised: \"We say that it is not true that forced labour is unproductive under all conditions.\" (The collection \"Roster ur ruinerna\" / \"Voices from the Ruins\", edited by Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Igor Shafarevich, Stockholm, 1978, p. 53.) In Trotsky's view, the workers, the peasants and the unions had to be subordinated to the interests of the Communist Party in the name of the socialist build-up work. These commando tactics brought the nation to the edge of the abyss and caused massive destruction. Trotsky did not care. He had diligently studied the history of Mesopotamia and it was from there he got his insane ideas. The Akkadian king Sargon I (2335-2279 B.C.) founded an empire embracing Sumer, Babylonia, Elam and Assyria. Ur was made the capital city. During the third dynasty of Ur, which began 2112 B.C., Ur-Nammu (2112-2095) imposed a despotic and centralised system which Trotsky imitated. The workers of Mesopotamia, which Sargon had united into a single state, received products from the state. The products of the workshops went into state depots. Like the farmers, the craftsmen were divided into groups, each under a leader. Necessities were distributed by the state by the aid of lists. The norm for necessities received was set after effectiveness. There were also norms for work, which determined the size of the workers' rations. Workers could be transported from one place to another, from one workshop to another. The authorities could send their craftsmen out of the city to work in the fields or pull barges. Farmers were sent to the workshops to help out. The fatality rate among the workers increased to approximately 10-28 per cent. In Soviet Russia, Trotsky had all supplies sent to state depots. The goods were exchanged for other goods. A decree was issued obliging everyone to work for the state. Those who transgressed the laws or left duties undone were punished severely as deserters. After all, they were \"soldiers of work\". Stalin later used the same system in his concentration camps. That was why Trotsky's militar ised work system would never have been a better alternative than Stalinism. Trotsky was simply worse. In reality, the Russian workers became slaves to the international extremist Jews who had come into power and camouflaged their system 156"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"with fair Communist slogans. The goods sold on the international market made the Jewish leaders in Russia extremely rich. Their bank accounts became fatter and fatter as we can now see in the formerly secret Communist Party archives. Trotsky, fo r example, besides his two Ameri- can bank accounts holding 80 million dollars, had 90 million Swiss francs in Swiss banks. Moisei Uritsky (a ctually Boretsky) had 85 million, Felix Dzerzhinsky (actually Rufin) 80 m illion, Ganetsky 60 million Swiss francs and 10 million dollars. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, pp. 82-84.) Kuhn, Loeb & Co, who through their German branches supported Trotsky's take-over in Russia in the autumn of 1917 with 20 million dollars, were later, in a half-year period, given 102 290 000 dollars in return. (New York Times, 23rd of August 1921.) That is to say, everybody involved in the conspiracy made enor mous amounts of money from the sufferings of the Russian people. The Bolsheviks acted like criminals and super-capitalists simul- taneously. The ruling oligarchy - the Nomenclature - was transformed by Lcnin and Trotsky into a Golem, which parasitically plundered the goods of its subjects. (Executive Intelligence Review, No. 39, 30th of September 1988, p. 29.) In Jewish folklore, the Golem was a magical monster who, with a Cabbalistic spell, could be animated to plunder, harm or destroy the goyim (Gentiles). In the spirit of the Golem, special squads forced themselves into the houses and flats of the Russians to steal their gold and jewels. So, first the Kahal, a type of Jewish community system, was introduced (the Soviets), then the Golem was created (the Cheka was an artificial being which appropriated the possessions of the Russians and gave them into the hands of its master, the Communist leadership), and last but not least the entire population was shut into a ghetto which, on the 30th of December 1922 was named the Soviet Union. This was the way in which KGG (Kahal, Golem, Ghetto) was founded. The Golem was also regarded as an enormous dragon who would battle against the enemies of the Jewish people. That was why the leadership of the Cheka invented the term \"enemies of the people\"; for there was only one race who held power - the others were just a worthless mass - no better than cattle. That was why the Chekists used to deport \"enemies of the people\" in cattle trucks. 157"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" All who dared criticise the only true - soviet or Kahalist - system, were regarded as \"enemies of the people\". The Soviets, meanwhile, had been stripped of power. By the side of every soviet there was now a parallel Party committee who held the real power. Through this principle of double responsibility, the Golem could control the situation like a spider in the centre of a vast web... But just like in the Jewish folktale, the Golem finally turned on its own creators. Hundreds of thousands of Jews began emigrating from the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. Trotsky's Comrades Leon Trotsky began as people's commissary for foreign affairs, following which he was named people's commissary for war. Lenin called Trotsky \"without doubt the most capable member of the central committee\" and spoke positively about his skill. 158"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Trotsky's co-workers were also very clever international bandits. I shall name only the most important chiefs within the military commissariat. Eighty per cent of the whole commissariat were Jews. All the chiefs were Jews. The Vice-People's Commissary for Military Affairs was Yefraim Shchklyansky, who had arrived with t he third train from Switzerland. His subordinates were, among others, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky (actually Minei Gubelman) and Semyon Nakhimson. The following were members of the military council: Arkadi Rosengoltz, Mikhail Lashevich, Robert Rimm, Joseph Unschlicht, D. Weinman, Moisei Lisovsky, Isaac Zelinsky, German Bitker, Moisei Rukhimovich, Bela Kun (actually Aaron Kohn), Grigori Sokolnikov (actually Brilliant) and Josef Khorovsky. Some of the army commanders were: Vladimir Lazarevich, Naum Zorkin, Yona Yakir, Vadim Bukhman, Boris Feldman and Yevgeni Shi- lovsky. Other important Jewish leaders in the Red Army were: Ari Mirsky, Gavril Lindov-Leytezen, Boris Zul, Yevgeni Veger, Isaac Kiselstein, M.

People had no idea of the real situation. Nearly all the chiefs of the concentration camps were Jews. The most infamous of these were: Naftali Frenkel, Matvei Berman, Aaron Soltz, Yakov Rappaport, Lazar Kogan. According to the Jewish researcher and publicist Arkadi Vaksberg, eleven out of twelve chiefs of camps in the GULAG were Jews. (Alexander Vaksberg, \"Lubyanka\", Stockholm, 1993.) It was also Trotsky who had decided that the independent, well-to-do farmers should be annihilated and the others transformed into workers on kibbutzes or collective households, which were called kolkhozes in Russian. Stalin and Kaganovich carried through this action in 1929. Everything that happened in Russia under the cover of Communism was actually strongly connected with the religion of the Jews. Their own extremists in their vanity have admitted this. The rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise in New York said: \"Some called it Communism, but I called it Judaism.\" (Curtis B. Dall, \"The Military Order of the World Wars\", The Army-Navy Club, Washington, 1973, p. 12.) It has also been said that the Old Testament was the textbook of Bolshevism. In Genesis, chapter 47, verses 13-26, it is described how Joseph cunningly exploited a famine to enslave the Egyptians. He had gathered in huge amounts of grain (Gen. 41:29-57) in order to sell it to the Egyptians, in years of dearth, for cattle, land and their own freedom. This story inevitably brings to mind how the Russian peasants were enslaved and forced into Kibbutzes by means of an artificial famine in 1932-33. Also, according to a Jewish Midrash (Bible commentary), it was a pious act of Joseph to withhold enormous profits, made in the Pharaoh's name, for the enrichment of his own family; this was tacitly excused by Jehovah's later command in Exodus 3:22: \"Ye shall despoil the Egyptians!\" (Source: Robert Graves and Raphael Patai, Hebrew Myths, \"The book of Genesis\", London, 1964, pp. 266-267.) Was it not true that the ancient dreams of the Jewish extremists were realised as they took away the G entiles' money, cattle, houses, religion and personal liberty? Plundering was officially called the nationalisation of private property. 160"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"On the 12th of April 1919 the newspaper Kommunist (Kharkov) published comrade M. Kohan's article \"The Jews' Services to the Wor- king Class\" where he wrote the following: \"It can be said without exaggeration that the Great Socialist October Revolution was brought about through the hands of the Jews... the red five- pointed star, which was known as a Judaic symbol in ancient times, has now been taken over by the Russian pr oletariat... Jewish commissars as leaders of committees and soviet organisations lead the Russian proletariat to victory... Could the dark and oppressed masses of Russian workers and peasants throw off the yoke of the bourgeoisie themselves? No, it was the Jews from beginning to end who showed the Russian proletariat the way to the rosy dawn of internationalism and who to this day rule Soviet Russia. The proletariat can feel secure in the hands of the Jews. We can be calm while comrade Trotsky commands the Red Army.\" Comrade M. Kohan admitted that there was not one single Jewish soldier in the Red Army, but that the Jews commanded it. Documents now available confirm this. On the night before the 9th (22nd) of December 1919, during the Estonian war of liberation against the Bolsheviks, a Jewish battalion commander, Shunderev, fell in a battle against Estonian troops. Among his papers there was a secret circular containing an appeal to all Jewish chiefs for the forming of a secret Zionist society. The letter was written in Russian by the central committee at the Israeli World Union's department in Petrograd on the 18th March 1918. The entire text was published in two Estonian newspapers. Here are some excerpts from the letter published in the newspaper Postimees (Tartu) on the 31st of December 1919: \"Sons of Israel! The time of our final victory is near. We stand at the beginning of our world dominion and our renown. That which we only dreamed about before has nearly become reality... Despite the fact that Russia has been subdued and lies under our punishing foot, we must still be careful. We have transformed Russia into an economic slave and we have taken nearly all of its riches and gold and forced it to kneel before us. But we must be careful in keeping our secret. We must not have any compassion for our enemies. We must eliminate their best and most talented individuals, so that the subjugated Russia will be without its leaders. In this way, we shall destroy every opportunity to rebel against us. We must provoke class war and dissension among the 161"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"blind peasants and workers.

Trotsky- Bronstein, Zinoviev-Radomyslsky, Urit sky, Kamenev-Rosenfeld, Steinberg - these and many other faithful sons of Israel hold the highest posts in the nation and rule over the enslaved Slavs. We shall defeat Russia totally. Our people play leading roles in the city committees, the commissariats, the victualling committees, the house committees and other institutions. But don't let the victory go to your heads!\" Information now available confirms these statements and the authenticity of the letter. Among Moisei Uritsky's investigation material, a secret document, copied on May 17, 1918, was found. It was the same circular as that found on the dead Jewish battalion commander Shunderev. This was published in Russia for the first time in February 1994. Jewish \"revolutionaries\" knew that every state could be effectively destroyed by the aid of socialism and civil war. It was possible to control everything by simply gaining control of the production of foodstuffs, the hospitals and the energy sources. Despite the dreadful terror, more and more Russians dared to express their discontentment with the rule of the Bolshevik Jews. The intellectuals were especially open about their beliefs. Therefore, on the 27th of July 1918, Izvestiya published an appeal by the Council of the People's Commissaries to the Russian people. This appeal condemned \"anti- Semitism as a danger to the cause of the workers' and peasants' revolution\". The anti-Semites were outlawed and executed on the spot. Lenin himself signed the appeal but the initiative was Trotsky's. Lenin stressed that anti-Semitism implied counter-revolution. Trotsky regarded all patriots as anti-Semites. In April 1919, in the middle of the great terror in Kiev, Trotsky visited the city and ordered that all Russian patriots should be exterminated. They were beaten to death with hammers and their brains ended up on the floor of the shed where this crime was later discovered. (Platonov, \"The History of the Russian People in the 20th Century\", part I, Moscow, 1997, p. 611.) Lenin himself confirmed that the Soviet regime really was Jewish. When it was reported to Lenin that a newly formed committee did not have a single Jewish member, he was upset: \"Not a single Jew? No, no! That's impossible!\" (Oleg Platonov, \" Russia's Crown of Thorns: The History of the Russian People in the 20th Century\", Moscow, 1997, part I, 162"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"p. 519.) According to one the leading Soviet functionaries, Lazar Kaganovich, Lenin demanded that every Soviet Institution should have, if not a Jewish director, then at leas t a Jewish vice-chairman.\" (Chuyev, \"Thus Spoke Kaga-novich\", Moscow, 1992, p. 100.) The majority of the Jews, even if t hey did not regard themselves as Bolsheviks, nevertheless supported the Soviet power, looking upon it as their own, as Jewish. Also many rich Jews, fearing for their wealth, preferred the Reds to the Whites. Instead of the privileges their riches had afforded them, they received a lot of privileges thanks to their being close to the power and to the possibility of becoming a power over Russia themselves. The Jews, according to Lenin, \"saved the Soviet power\" - \"the Jews certainly created the skeleton of this power and at the same time gave the people occasion to identify the Soviet power with the power of Jewry\". (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The History of the Russian People in the 20th Century\", Moscow, 1997, Vol. I, p. 583.) The Doom of Admiral Shchastny In the summer of 1993, previously secret information was published about Trotsky's murder of admiral Alexei Shchastny on June 21, 1918 in Moscow. The reason for the murder was very simple. In the early spring of 1918, Trotsky had given Shchastny, commander of the Baltic fleet, orders to surrender all of his warships (about 200) to the Germans but the admiral had refused. The Jew Adolf Yoffe, who was Trotsky's close comrade and head of the Soviet delegation at the peace negotiations in Brest, said to the Germans: \"There will be neither peace nor war.\" The Germans took the hint and kept hold of the Russian territory they had occupied. They had further demands. Lenin and Trotsky tried to evade the issue but the Germans threatened to reveal them both as paid agents if Berlin was not allowed to keep a million square kilometres of Russian territory, and was not given 6000 million marks and the Baltic fleet in compensation. Lenin and Trotsky gave in. The Baltic fleet was just then stationed off Helsinki. As mentioned, Admiral Shchastny refused to obey orders and decided to save the whole fleet and sail it home to Kronstadt. London demanded that the Russians 163"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"should not surrender the fleet to the Germans; they should blow it up instead. The pressure from London was enormous. So Trotsky gave a new order to blow up the warships in such a way that the damage done would be minimal and the Germans could easily repair them. Then the British secret service intervened and gave the admiral copies of German secret service letters containing instructions to Lenin and Trotsky in connection with the Baltic fleet. The admiral realised that Soviet leaders, Lenin and Trotsky, were betraying Russia to a foreign power so he made sure that 167 warships were brought through the ice to Kronstadt. Berlin was furious. Trotsky wanted to revenge himself on the admiral. He could not do so at once since Shchastny was very popular. In any other state, the admiral would have been decorated for his heroic deed but Trotsky wanted him punished. The admiral was summoned to the Kremlin on May 28, 1918. Trotsky asked the decisive question: \"Did the admiral wish to serve the Soviet regime or not?\" A simple answer like \"yes\" would have been enough, but Trotsky never heard this answer so the admiral was arrested immediately. During the third day under arrest, the admiral was informed that there was to be a trial. It turned out that the Bolshevik leaders had opened the admiral's briefcase, containing copies of the Germans' instructions to Lenin and Trotsky. The admiral had made a grave error - he had not made those letters public, but had brought them to Moscow. Trotsky also read the admiral's diary, which revealed that Shchastny did not like the Soviet regime. A farce called a trial took place on the 20th of June 1918. The indictment was communicated to the admiral only two hours before the trial. He never had time to read it. Only one member of the public was allowed to be present - the admiral's sister. There was only one witness, who also presented the official accusation. The witness was Leon Trotsky. The admiral was charged with high treason and sentenced to death. On the 21st of June, the Chinese Brigade, who spoke no Russian, was called to the Alexandrovsk School. This group executed the admiral and, according to orders, put the body in a sack, which was buried under the floor in one of the rooms. The order came from Leon Trotsky. Today, the Russian ministry of defence occupies this building, not far from the Kremlin. (Sovershenno Sekretno, No. 6, 1993.) Neither the British nor 164"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Hitler ever used those secret letters to expose the true nature of the Soviet leaders and thereby weaken the Kremlin. The question is whether they were all working for an omnipresent but invisible international power. The Kronstadt Rebellion In February 1921, the workers in Petrograd and the sailors in Kronstadt had had enough. Several strikes broke out in Petrograd on the 22nd of February. The workers no longer wanted communist guards in the factories. The communist leadership had also cut the bread ration by a third (heavy industry workers received 800 grams per day, normal workers 600). The wages had sunk to a tenth of what they had been before the Bolsheviks grabbed power and the inflation rate was catastrophic. Workers who had sneaked past roadblocks and left town headed for the countryside to find food but were either arrested or simply shot, since the factories were ruled by military discipline. Trotsky had also introduced the American Taylor system (named afte r the American economist Frederic Winslow Taylor, born in Germantown, 1856, died in 1915) which transformed workers into robots. Lenin was fascinated with this system. The Bolshevik leadership began executing striking workers as deserters. Many were arrested. Troubles also broke out in Moscow. The demonstra- tors demanded, among other things: \"Down with the communist Jews!\" (Harrison E. Salisbury, \"De ryska revolutionerna\" / \"The Russian Revo- lutions\", Stockholm, 1979, p. 234.) The workers also raised demands for the immediate resignation of Lenin and wanted the Constituent Assembly re-established. As the threats against the communist Jews became louder everywhere, the aggressive Jewish leader Mikhail Lashevich called the striking, disappointed workers \"bloodsuckers who are trying to practise extortion\". The Jewish communist leaders panicked when the sailors in Kronstadt sided with the workers. At a meeting on the 1st of March, the sailors declared their displeasure with the political section of the Baltic fleet. They had been used to choosing their own commanders and opposed the blind discipline the communist power-mongers required of them. The sailors of the battleship Petropavlovsk supported the workers' protests against the terrible oppression and presented their own program of 165"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"15 points, in which they, among other things, demanded new secret-ballot elections to the Soviets, since \"the present Soviets do not represent the will of the workers and peasants\", freedom of speech, freedom of organisation, the release of all socialist political prisoners, the abolition of commissaries and an end to the supremacy of the Communist Party. The resolution also demanded the right for workers and peasants to be self-employed as long as they employed no one else and that all Jews were to be removed from high posts. The last demand was the most important, according to Alexander Berkman. 15 000 sailors and workers backed this resolution. The resolution condemned the communist government totally and utterly. The Jewish Bolsheviks were scared, but did not wish to consent to even the least of these demands - the removal of communist guards from roadblocks and factories and the introduction of equal rationing. Instead, the leaders tried to make the sailors withdraw the resolution entirely. It was impossible. The sailors shouted: \"We'd rather die than give up!\" Then the politruks threatened that \"the Party will not relinquish power without a struggle\". First mate Perichenko of the Petropavlovsk, who was the leader of the rebellion, had the local Communist Party elite imprisoned in the beginning of March. All strategic points were occupied. Among the rebels were social democrats, but also Russian Bolsheviks, anarchists, syndicalists, Social Revolutionaries and various other left-wing groups who wanted to get rid of the Jewish communist control of the \"revolution\". On the 6th of March Leon Trotsky was infuriated. At first he wanted to use poison gas, which he had quickly acquired from abroad, against the rebels. Then he said that all those demanding free speech, free press and free trade unions should be shot \"like ducks in a pond\" or \"like dogs\". He ordered the rebels to give up. They refused. On the 7th of March, the Red Army opened fire with artillery and attacked Kronstadt from the air. The 561st infantry regiment attacked across the ice on the 8th of March. The ice broke in several places and hundreds of soldiers drowned. Nearly all of the second battalion later went over to the rebels. The Red Army units refused to attack the sailors. Then new, loyal troops were put in; 60 000 handpicked Red Guards. On the 18th of March (the day of the Red Aid), the 7th army under Mikhail Tukhachevsky attacked the garrison of 16 000 men. The sailors were 166"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"driven back; fort after fort, street after street. Finally, only about a hundred sailors vainly tried to hold a last defence by the Tolbukhin lighthouse. Tukhachevsky later said that he had never seen anything like the bloodbath he experienced in Kronstadt. \"It was no normal battle,\" he explained, \"it was an inferno. The sailors fought like wild beasts. I cannot understand from where they drew the strength for their fury. Each house had to be taken by storm.\" The revolt was put down by the 21st of March. About 1000 sailors were killed. 2500 were taken prisoner. The Red Guards lost 10 000 men. Most of the rebels managed to escape with their families across the Gulf of Finland to Terijoki and eventually ended up in Helsinki. Finland was forced to extradite them in 1945, 24 years later. Most of those captured were mercilessly shot by order of Trotsky. A total of 30 000 people were executed in this terrible bloodbath. The official statement was: \"Severe proletarian sentences were imposed on all traitors to the cause.\" It has only now been revealed that Trotsky personally led the mass executions of sailors, their families and others involved. (Dagens Nyheter, November 25, 1993.) The Jewish anarchist Alexander Berkman from the United States of America visited Kronstadt after the storming. He wrote in his diary: \"Kronstadt has fallen. Thousands of corpses of sailors lie in the streets. The execution of the prisoners continues.\" Trotsky had thereby de- finitively sullied his hands with the blood of the sailors and workers. In remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the Paris Commune and the victory over Kronstadt, he had the bands play \"The Internationale\", the infamous anthem of the socialists-communists. Kronstadt was the climax of the Leninist terror. Both Lenin and Trotsky were shaken by the Rebellion. Lenin was very pleased with the arrogant Trotsky's cruel contributions. Both believed, however, that the Russians needed a calmer period after all the terrible killing, which had been going on steadily for several years. The Chekists had used every imaginable excuse to kill. In the town of Bryansk, the death penalty was introduced for drunkenness, in Vyatka for \"being out-of-doors after 20:00 hours\", in other areas for theft. The prisoners were brought to execution cellars, were made to undress, stood against a wall and shot by a little firing squad armed with pistols. A Chekist with a handcart removed the corpses, which were then winched up like animal carcasses and dropped through a 167"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"trapdoor into a waiting lorry. Then more prisoners were brought in and the procedure was repeated. In Petrograd, the soviet leader Grigori Zinoviev demanded in a speech that the inhabitants of Russia who could not be won over to the cause of Communism should be liquidated. (Det Basta, No. 2, 1968, p. 136.) In other words, Russia was occupied by groups of Jewish gangsters, who later also fought against each other. Eventually, about a million Jews died in this way. Professor Israel Shahak stressed in his valuable book \"Jewish history, Jewish religion - The Weight of Three Thousand Years\" (London, 1994) that fanatical Jews have always tried to follow the instructions according to which they must kill all \"traitors\" of Jewish blood - those who do not accept their own extreme points of view. This was once again confirmed by the murder of Yitzhak Rabin on the 4th November 1995. Those Jewish extremist groups were the worst enemies of all sensible people (including civilised Jews) in Russia. These criminals should not be despised and hated, even now after the event, since, from a spiritual point of view, they were si mply the bearers of very primitive and destructive ideas. Hatred leads nowhere. Those criminals demonstrated the truth of this themselves. To ease the oppression so that the toppling economy could get on its feet again, Trotsky and Lenin agreed to temporarily allow limited private business ventures. According to the Russian historian Viktor Nanolov, it was Trotsky who abolished his own military economy and worked out the plans for NEP - the New Economic Policy. It was cunning politics - first the severe War Communism, then NEP with an abundance of bread to get the Soviet regime accepted... Of course, the Jews exploited the situation, which arose during the NEP period. In 1924, one third of all shops in Russia were owned by Jews (\"Universal Jewish Encyclopaedia\", \"Revolution of People\"). Trotsky as a Grey Eminence When, in 1922, Lenin introduced the most important post of General Secretary of the Central Committee, he wished Trotsky to take this post. Trotsky declined since it would have looked bad to the outside world if there was a Jew at the very top of the communist hierarchy. In the end, 168"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"there was the choice of two men for this post - the half-Jew Joseph Stalin (actually Dzhugashvili), and the Russian Ivan Smirnov, a friend of Trotsky's. On the 3rd of April 1922, Stalin was finally chosen. Stalin ordered Smirnov executed in 1936. Leon Trotsky wanted to be Joseph Stalin's spiritual guide, a grey eminence who could rule the country through this mediocre general secretary. Trotsky called Stalin a grey spot and regarded him as no more than an uneducated administrator. This was, actually, a fair judgement of him - Stalin remained a totally ignorant person until his death. Many years later it became evident that Stalin would no longer let himself be controlled by Trotsky. On the contrary, he wanted to make all the decisions himself. He thought this was possible! At the same time, he wanted to reduce the influence of the Jews on soviet politics. However, when he went too far against the extremist Jews, he himself lost his life. His Jewish wife Roza poisoned him on the orders of her brother Lazar Kaganovich, according to the confession of the latter in Moscow in 1981. The socialist Zionist author Arnold Zweig believed Trotsky was Lenin's rightful heir. Zweig admitted that his own intellectual sustenance came from the Illuminatus Moses Mendelssohn. In any case, Stalin implemented at least most of Trotsky's ideas (he lacked any of his own). Stalin learned much from Trotsky, especially when Trotsky, at the twelfth Party Congress in May 1923, stressed that the Party was always right. Stalin never murdered as intensively as Trotsky. If Trotsky had actually become general secretary, all Russia would have drowned in rivers of blood. In her memoirs, Trotsky's second wife, Natalya Sedovaya-Trotskaya, showed no compassion at all for any of the millions of her husband's victims. She was, in fact, the daughter of a Zionist banker, Ivan Zhivo- lovsky (actually Avram Zhivatovzo), who helped finance the Bolsheviks' take-over, at first in Russia and then in Stockholm, via Nya Banken (a Swedish bank, owned by the Jewish family Aschberg). This was another reason why the freemason Leon Trotsky always protected the international interests of rich Jews. Ivan Zhivotovsky had close connections with the Warburgs and the Schiffs. Myths about the kind Trotsky have been spread in Sweden too: \"If only he had won the power struggle, then there would have been freedom of 169"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"speech in the Soviet Union.\", \"It would not have been useless to reform Communism if Trotsky had been in power.\" All this is, of course, serious disinformation. Trotsky despised parlia- mentary democracy and spat vitriol on the idea at every opportunity. Of all the Communists, it was he who detested democracy the most. This is apparent when reading his book \"What is the Soviet Union and Where is it Going?\", published in Paris in 1936. On page 219, he explained that the advocates of the liquidated classes should have no right to form political parties. He stressed that those who support capitalism in the Soviet Union are acting like Don Quixote and lack even the ability to form a party. In 1922, Trotsky was the most violent opponent of the oppositional groups within the Party. He demanded that those should be liquidated immediately. He suggested that the private plots of land should be confiscated since they, in his opinion, might give rise to an ideological infection among the peasants. Without those plots of land, there would be an immediate food shortage in the cities and it would thereby be easier to control the intellectuals still remaining. The system Trotsky wanted to introduce was completely centralised. It would have created such a horrible, surreal reign of terror as even Stalin and his Jewish advisers failed to accomplish. With Trotsky in power, Russia would have met an even worse fate than it did. The ideas of the Trotskyists about military socialism were enforced in part by Mao Zedong in China during the \"Cultural Revolution\". Those terrible experiments reached a frightening perfection in Pol Pot's Cambodia. All this is evident when reading Trotsky's book \"The Revo- lution Betryed: What is the Soviet Union and Where is it Going?\" Trotsky was so powerful in 1922 that he greeted the parade on the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution alone, without Lenin. It was Trotsky who, as early as 1924, demanded an immediate end to the concessions of NEP. Stalin began demanding this three years later - in 1927. NEP was finally abolished in December 1929. Trotsky was the most actively involved in the liquidation of the free market in the Soviet Union. It was also Trotsky who spurred the Communist leadership to make new conquests. In January 1918 he demanded that the 15 000 Finnish reds should immediately seize power in Helsinki. To that end, Lenin promised to send weapons to Jukka Rahja. The weapons arrived. Everything was ready for a Communist national coup. But then the Germans demanded 170"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"that the Bolsheviks stay out of Poland, Lithuania, Courland and also Livonia, Estonia, Finland and the Ukraine. The Bolsheviks were not allowed to crush Finland. Lenin and Trotsky were forced to comply with the German demands on the 3rd of March 1918. (Nootti, Helsinki, No. 4, 1989.) At the beginning of 1921, Trotsky wanted an immediate incorporation of Georgia in the Soviet Union. He received support from Joseph Stalin and Grigori (Sergo) Ordzhonikidze. Trotsky had a plan worked out straight away and Soviet agents took over power in the province of Borchalin on February 12, 1921. On the 16th of February the Georgian Soviet Republic was declared in Shulaveri and the revolutionary committee asked Moscow for help. One day later the Soviet troops who had been waiting by the border began the attack on the Georgian republic. On the 25th of February the Red Army took Tiflis (Tbilisi), Georgia's capital. The action was completed. The Bolsheviks immediately began killing the intellectuals. Trotsky also made plans to invade Armenia and Iran, but the last plan failed. Trotsky was very disappointed that it was impossible to occupy the Baltic states. In January 1918, Lenin complained to Trotsky: \"It would be very unfortunate if we must give up socialist Estonia.\" Trotsky as an Anti-Intellectual The claim about Trotsky's liberal attitude to the arts is also a fabrication. He believed that the Communist Party should have a monopoly on culture and the arts. It was Trotsky who forced socialist realism on the artists. Landscape paintings could not be made in the Sahara, in his opinion. Neither did he believe in the existence of free imagination. He demanded that all artists should follow the line of realism. It was also Trotsky who dealt out political certificates to the authors, without which they could not continue working at all. Trotsky decided what was allowed to be depicted and not. Both Lenin and Trotsky believed everything created outside the Marxist doctrine was anti-social art. Mikhail Bulgakov was given the task of writing a Communist play. He refused. There were few authors who dared to refuse. Afterwards, he had no chance to publish himself. In 1929, Bulgakov wrote to Gorky: \"Why 171"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"must the Soviet Union detain an author who is not allowed to publish his work? Is the intention to destroy him?\" In 1939, he had become desperate and wrote the play \"Batum\" - an apology (rather a smothered scream) and a tribute to the young revolutionary Stalin. This did him no good. He lacked the proper background! In his brilliant novel \"The Master and Margarita\", published only in 1966, he held cowardice as the deadliest sin. According to the myth, Trotsky also held liberal or avantgarde views on literature. It was even claimed that he was a very competent literary critic. In 1923, Trotsky published his collected articles on literature, along with his decisions, approved by the Party, regarding censorship. The title of this awful book is \"Literature and Revolution\" (published in English in 1991). According to this book, Trotsky's aim was to transform literature into a weapon of the revolution. He wrote that all ideas dangerous to Communism must be purged. He believed in using the forms of \"dangerous\" art, however, and thereby propagating the 'wholesome' Communist content. It is hard to imagine any idea more vile than this. This was the birth of propaganda art. The proletarian culture (which really means cultureless-ness) was enforced. Trotsky did not hide this fact. He stressed that the workers had no time left to take part in cultural life, since they had to fight for the revolution. The short pauses between the battles were not enough. He comforted them with a possible chance of enjoying these other values 50 years later, when the revolution was victorious. Only then could they devote themselves to proletarian culture, but until then the workers were first and foremost soldiers of the revolution. The Murder of Sergei Yesenin As if all this was not enough, Trotsky also had Russia's most prominent poet, Sergei Yesenin, murdered. Official cause of death: suicide. Despite the fact that his head had been crushed so that brain tissue had leaked out, Yesenin had still been able to hang himself, according to the death certificate of the Jewish pr ofessor Alexander Gilyarevsky. The principal reason for the murder was Yesenin's new poem, \"Land of Crooks\" in which he surprisingly describes a Jewish tyrant - Leibman- Chekistov. All his acquaintances re cognised Bronstein-Trotsky by the description. Yesenin welcomed the \"revolution\" at the beginning but soon 172"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"grew disillusioned with it and managed to perceive the dark forces at work behind the political spectacle. That was why he wrote his revelatory poem in which he described how American businessmen took power in Russia with the help of political gangsters who became Soviet prospectors speculating in Marxism. He called the new power-mongers parasites and actually said that the Soviet republic was a bluff (this word was romanised!). He also described Trotsky's burning hatred of the Russian culture. Sergei Yesenin had declaimed passages from this poem to many of his acquaintances. Trotsky was informed about the content of the poem and was unable to forgive this. Yesenin's friend Alexei Ganin, who was also a poet, was arrested in March 1925. He was charged with the libel of comrade Leon Trotsky, sentenced to death and executed. He had, together with the other well- known poets Peter Oreshin, Sergei Klychkov and Yesenin, proclaimed officially that in Russia exclusively the Jews held power. These four had spoken loudly of the injustices of the Communist Jews against Russia in a bar at the end of 1923, according to a secret police report. Disposing of Yesenin was not so easy, however. He was already world famous. He had spent the years 1922-23 in several European countries and the United States of America, together with his American wife, Isadora Duncan, who was a ballet dancer. As early as the 20th of February 1924, Judge Kommissarov in Moscow had decided to arrest Yesenin for anti- Semitic statements. Yesenin learnt about this and went underground. In the beginning of September 1924, Yesenin was hiding in Baku when the GPU man Yakov Blumkin suddenly turned up at Yesenin's hotel and threatened him with a revolver and described what awaited such as him in the GPU cellar in Moscow. Yesenin escaped to Tiflis (Tbilisi) in Georgia, where he acquired a revolver, upon which he returned to Baku. On the 6th of September 1925, Yesenin took a train back to Moscow together with Sofia Tolstaya. Two Jews - A. Rog and Levit - suddenly turned up and provoked Yesenin to make statements critical of Jews. Levit and Rog held Yesenin at the station of Kursk and handed him over to the militia. Judge Lipkin demanded his arrest. But he was released, just as had been done in Moscow on the 23rd of March 1924, when the secret agents of the GPU, the Jewish brothers M. and I. Neiman wanted to charge him with anti-Semitism (pursuant to paragraphs 172 and 176 of the criminal 173"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"code). The GPU had then gathered together a large amount of de- nunciations describing anti-Semitic statements made by Yesenin, who was well aware of the real situation in Russia. This trial would probably have attracted too much attention and the names of several secret agents who had infiltrated Yesenin's circle of acquaintances would also have been revealed. That was why they chose on a number of occasions not to take him to trial, despite the fact that indictments of anti-Semitism (i.e. counter- revolution) had already been brought in against him. So Trotsky decided to dispose of Yesenin in another way. Yesenin moved from Moscow to Leningrad on the evening of the 23rd of December 1925. He wanted to find a good new flat there, to give out his poems in two volumes and begin publishing his own periodical. He intended to stay at the hotel Angleterre in the beginning. Yesenin's murder became a special mission for the GPU, who had earlier kidnapped opponents of the Soviet regime, even abroad, and taken them to Moscow to execute them there. A group of assassins led by Yakov Blumkin arrived at Yesenin's hotel on the night before December 28, 1925 and broke into his room. Their henchman was Wolf Erlich, who was later given the task of leading astray the investigation into Yesenin's death. Yesenin resisted, surprisingly enough. His neighbours heard this. Then the murderers kicked Yesenin and seriously injured his head with an object before they hanged the great poet. This was how the brave Sergei Yesenin died. Yesenin's murderer Yakov Blumkin began his career as a rabbi in the synagogue in Odessa. Like many other orthodox extremist Jews, he sought a position in the Cheka after the Bolsheviks came into power. At the same time he was an official member of t he Social Revolutionary Party. Trotsky gave him the mission of murdering the German ambassador Count Wilhelm von Mirbach, on the 6th of July 1918, to prevent the Brest- Litovsk peace agreement. The Social Revolutionaries were accused of this murder. Also the Communist Aino Kuusinen related in her memoirs that Blumkin murdered Mirbach. After the murder of Ambassador Mirbach, Blumkin was appointed to the Cheka in Kiev in April 1919. In the summer of 1920 he returned to Moscow, where he studied at the military academy. Blumkin was later named military inspector of Caucasia, where he led the crushing of an anti-Soviet rebellion in Georgia in the summer of 1924. Blumkin became 174"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"truly infamous. He was later sent to Mongolia, where he was made chief of the political police. He began to murder people there with such insane eagerness that the GPU leadership in Moscow had to call him back, according to information from Boris Bazhanov's memoirs. He later helped Trotsky write the propaganda book \"How the Revolution Armed\". In 1925, Trotsky gave him the mission to pursue the poet Yesenin unto his death. All this has now been revealed in the Russian press. The Journalist Georgi Ustinov and his wife Yelizaveta, who also stayed at the hotel, were the first to enter Yesenin's room on the morning of December 28th. The assassins had searched through Yesenin's papers and other belongings. They were probably searching for the manuscript of \"Land of Crooks\". (Molodaya Gvardiya, No. 19, 1990.) Wolf Erlich also turned up soon after. Ustinov understood what had really happened and promised to tell the whole truth about the poet's murder. On the following day Georgi Ustinov and his wife were found hanged in their room. It was certified that violence had been used against them before they died. On the 29th of December 1925, the evening press announced that the 30-year-old poet Yesenin had taken his own life. Blumkin was finally sent to the Middle East as soviet spy-chief. He recruited agents in Syria, Palestine and Egypt. He used a passport in the name of Sultan-Zade. Blumkin's chiefs then were Vyacheslav Menzhinsky and Mikhail (Meier) Trilisser. Hangman Blumkin's days also ended by the aid of hangmen. Stalin had him executed on the 3rd of November 1929 for his meeting with Trotsky in Constantinople in the summer of 1929. Before Blumkin died he shouted: \"Long live Trotsky!\" (Yuri Fel shtinsky, \"Collapse of the World Revolution\", London, 1991, pp. 617-618.) Stalin as Victor When Trotsky finally realised that it was impossible to manipulate through Stalin, he began to attack the General Secretary, since Stalin took his post seriously. At a meeting of the Politburo in the beginning of 1925, Trotsky called Stalin the gravedigger of the revolution. In spite of Trotsky's incredibly cruel contributions to the implementation of the llluminist-Communist policies, Stalin wanted to get rid of him and his 175"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"companions after this statement. So Trotsky was relieved of the post of people's commissary for military affairs in January. Trotsky's successor was Mikhail Frunze. Trotsky was expelled from the Politburo on the 23rd of October 1926. In August 1927 Stalin managed to manoeuvre him out of the Party, and on the 16th of January 1928, he was exiled to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan. In October 1927, Trotsky had tried to combat Stalin by referring to Lenin's \"testament\". It was already too late. Stalin, meanwhile, tried to gain access to Adolf Yoffe's bank accounts. Trotsky's close comrade Yoffe refused to give his money to Stalin and chose to commit suicide on November 17, 1927. Trotsky had thereby lost his chief of propaganda. Parvus, Trotsky and Skobelev used to hold their meetings at Yoffe's in their youth. On the 31st of January 1929, Trotsky was expelled to Turkey, accused of espionage and counter-revolutionary ac tivities. Trotsky later lived in France and Norway. The Norwegian authorities demanded, after pressure from Moscow, that Trotsky should leave the country. Leon Trotsky had, in fact, published a book criticising Stalinism. He moved to Mexico where he founded his criminal organisation, the Fourth International - which became a Trotskyist subversive worl d movement for naive and immature people. In 1937, Trotsky inadvertently revealed his knowledge of the fact that the Second World War would break out within two or three years. Leon Trotsky was no longer useful to freemasonry as a confuser of the masses, so the freemasons began fighting him and his ideology. Trotsky admitted this himself in 1932. Trotsky's co-workers Zinoviev, Kamenev and many others perished in the Stalinist Soviet Union. The Murder of Trotsky Professor of history N. Vasetsky wrote in Literaturnaya Gazeta in January 1989 that Stalin personally gave the order to murder Trotsky. \"It is about time to put an end to Trotsky,\" he said. (Aftonbladet, January 17, 1989.) Stalin could not forget a past insult. This information comes from Soviet archives. It was earlier claimed in the Soviet Union that frustrated Trotskyists killed him. 176"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Leonid (Naum) Eitington, colonel in the NKVD, recruited the Spanish Communist Ramon Mercader to commit the murder. Eitington had been Ramon's mother's lover. Mercader, who was also a skilled mountaineer, infiltrated Trotsky's closest circle of acquaintances in his house in Coyoacan, then a suburb of Mexico City. Mercader crushed Trotsky's skull with an ice-pick on the 20th of August 1940. Trotsky died one day later, on the 21st of August. Unfortunately, his insane ideas did not die with him. On the 28th of March 1993, I noticed a disturbing piece of graffiti on a wall in Tarifa in southern Spain: \"Lenin's and Trotsky's business lives on.\" Stalin also had most of the Trotskyists killed. They were then in the concentration camps. In April 1938, Stalin gave orders to execute Trotsky's oldest brother Alexander Bronstein. In July of the same year, Trotsky's secretary Rudolf Klement was found, headless, in the river Seine in France. Trotsky's son Leon Sedov was poisoned in a Paris hospital. In 1989, there was a thaw for Leon Trotsky's writings also in the Soviet Union. The newspaper Komsomolets (Moscow) published several of Trotsky's articles in August 1989. In the summer of 1990 the authorities in Mexico City opened a Trotsky museum. Several hundred Mexicans praised his memory on the 50th anniversary of his death on the 21st of August 1990 (Dagens Nyheter, 22nd of August 1990). Trotsky's grandson Esteban Volkov complained that there was not yet a Trotsky museum in Moscow. The Trotskyists in Russia managed to form their own Workers' Democratic Party in March 1992, and promised to reinstate Communism as it was before Gorbachev's perestroika. (Aftonbladet, 22nd of March 1992.) Have we not learned anything from all the violence and terror? When will enough be enough? Leon Trotsky's great-grandson David Axelrod also followed in the terrorist tradition. He emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel, where he was arrested in his 28th year on June 12, 1989 for having destroyed the property of Palestinians and later insulting some Israeli soldiers, according to Reuter's news agency. Trotsky's murderer was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. In 1960 he moved first to Czechoslovakia and later to Moscow where he was proclaimed a hero of the Soviet Union and was given a gold star for his 177"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"deed. He later changed his name to Lopez. Ramon Mercader died in November 1978 in Havana at 65 years of age. Such is the untainted picture of the \"hero of the revolution\" Leiba Bron- stein and his misanthropic heritage, which has been concealed from us for so long behind cunning myths. The fanatical Trotsky wanted to use even more force and violence against the peasants than Stalin and his chief ad- visor, Lazar Kaganovich. Together with Lenin, Trotsky screamed: \"Death to them!\" There were six million peasants in Russia. \"Death to them!\" It has been claimed that Lenin was the brain of the revolution and Trotsky the soul. What a monstrous soul! He wrought immense havoc on Russia in order to subdue its inhabitants. While the Trotskyists claimed that their teacher never wove any intrigues, we can by the aid of docu- ments and his own quotes confirm that Trotsky was a particularly nasty sadist who destroyed everything of value and finally became a simple idiot, a cunning demagogue and an unfortunate criminal who died horribly. Trotsky was without doubt the cruellest and most dangerous \"revolutionary\" in the world, who ordered literally millions of Russians to be shot. He took children as hostages and, if necessary, ordered them mur- dered. It was Trotsky who released crim inals from the prisons and thereby also terrorised the people. Trotsky was a hard, cold devil, as the Swedish historian Peter Englund (once an active Trotskyist) characterised him. (Expressen, 21st of August 1990.) He had so much satanic evil in him that everything we learned about the inquisition of the Middle Ages pales in comparison. The brutal Trotsky successfully developed the violent tra- ditions of the Jacobins. It was Trotsky who said: \"We need no ministers, but we shall use people's commissaries.\" (The Jacobins in France had used commissaires.) Together with Lenin, Trotsky propagated the United States of the World. In October 1917 he said: \"The United States of Europe must be founded.\" Together with Lenin, he introduced the red cacistocracy's (the rule of the incompetent) cruel grip on Russia, which had to pay an enormous price for this destructive crime. It is easy to understand the logic behind those who popularised and spread the myths about Trotsky. Since St alin was evil, Trotsky must have been good. But they were both evil. Stalin was just untalented and lacked ideas of his own. Neither Stalin nor Trotsky had any personal friends. 178"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Russian feature film \"Trotsky\" premiered in the autumn of 1993.

In the same vein, the exiled Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyayev, in his book \"The Meaning of History\" (1923), warned about an ever darker anti-humanist period presaging an apocalyptic horror. Only now has it become relatively easy to describe the chain of events, which led the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The material, which has so far been made available, is, in itself, very shocking and it can definitively be shown that there was an international conspiracy behind the \"revolutions\" in Russia. In 1915 Alexander Parvus (Israel He lphand) made plans for the Bolshe- viks' (i.e. the Illuminati's) seizure of power by the aid of the German secret service. He had written the leading role for Vladimir Ulyanov- Lenin. In the same year, Parvus re ceived 7 million marks from the German Department of Finance \"to develop revolutionary propaganda in Russia\". Parvus met Lenin in Zurich in May 1915 to discuss his plans. Lenin stubbornly preferred Switzerland as the victim of the conspiracy. According to the American newspaper The New Federalist (11th of September 1987) Parvus contributed to the First World War with his intrigues. In any case, he was extremely well informed. He predicted in 1904 that the industrial countries would be drawn into a world war, which would be the bloody dawn of great events. Meanwhile, Lenin could not believe that the Communists would reach power in his lifetime. He said this in a lecture in Bern on the 22nd of January 1917, thus just before the February coup. (\"Collected Works\", Vol. 19, p. 357.) Nor did Lenin believe there would be a world war. This, too, shows that he was just a puppet in the hands of the international financial elite. 180"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Background of the First World War Here I should mention something about the background to the First World War. It was revealed during the trial of Gavrilo Princip and Nedelko Cabrinovic, the assassins of Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the Austrian throne), that the French Masonic organisation Grand Orient was behind the assassination plans, and not the Serbian nationalist organisation the Black Hand. This enormous provocation had been planned in Paris in 1912 at 16 Rue Cadets, the headquarters of Grand Orient. Nedelko Cabrinovic revealed in court how the freemasons had sentenced Franz Ferdinand to death. He learned this from the freemason Ziganovic (it was he who gave the Jewish assassin Princip a Browning pistol). Princip was also a freemason. The sentence was executed on the 28th of June 1914. Everything according to the stenographic report of the court published in Alfred Mousset's book \"L'Attentat de Sarajevo\", Paris, 1930. This information was later hushed up. It has also been kept secret that an attempt was made to murder Grigori Rasputin in Pokrovskoye in Siberia at exactly the same time. Rasputin was the magician of the Tsar's court and the Tsarina's favourite and was decidedly against Russia being drawn into a major war. (Colin Wilson \"The Occult\", London, 1971, p. 500.) The freemason Prince Felix Yusupov managed to kill Rasputin on December 29, 1916. The Austrian freemason and Bolshevik Karl Radek (Tobiach Sobel- sohn) also knew about this. He had always been well informed. Radek knew Ziganovic personally from his time in Paris. He tried to reveal the secrets about the war during the trial against him in Moscow in 1937, but Stalin's lackeys shut him up. He was not given another chance to speak and carried these secrets with him into the grave (Molodaya Gvardiya, No. 2, 1991, p. 121). What were the Grand Orient's motives? I do not need to speculate here. It is best to cite Zionist sources. The Zionist newspaper Peiewische Vordle wrote on the 13th of January 1919: \"The international Jewry... believed it necessary to force Europe into the war so that a new Jewish era could begin throughout the world.\" The periodical British Israel Truth stated in 1906: \"We must prepare our-selves for big changes in a Great War which faces the peoples of Europe.\" 181"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Jewish periodical Hammer was unusually forthright just before the February coup: \"The fate of the Russian empire has been staked upon one card... there is no rescue for the Russian government. The Jewry have decided this and thus it shall be.\" Litman Rosenthal explained in the newspaper American Jews' News on the 19th of September 1919 that the First World War was brought about through the intrigues of the Jews and that all this was planned in Basel as early as 1903. The rabbi Reichhorn in the periodical Le Contemporain proves that those plans were far-reaching on the 1st of July 1880: \"We shall force the goyim into a war by exploiting their pride, arrogance and stupidity. They will tear each other into pieces. They will force each other out of their countries, which we shall then be able to give to our people.\" At the same time, the plan was that the world war would diminish the success of the Germans on the international market, according to the historian Gary Allen. Karl Heise published the British freemasons' map of Europe from 1888. The map presented the new national borders of Europe, which became reality after the First World War. (Pekka Ervast, \"Vapaamuurareiden kadonnut sana\" / \"The Freemasons' Lost Word\", Helsinki, 1965, p. 78.) His interesting book \"Entente - Freimaurerei und Weltkrieg\", an analysis of the treacherous role of the freemasons in causing the First World War, was published in Basel in 1919. In the newspaper Truth, December 1890, a map was published that depicted the borders of Europe, which became reality in 1919. Three empires were gone. This was published as a satire: \"Look what the opponents of the freemasons have come up with!\" But in 1919, nobody was laughing any more. As I have related earlier, Parvus also found the money for the coup attempts in 1905. Now he took good care of Lenin. He made him editor of the newspaper Iskra as early as 1901, from his home in a Munich suburb, and also organised a printing office in Leipzig. Parvus made sure that the newspaper reached Russia. Parvus even let Lenin live in his flat in Zurich. (Lenin lived in Switzerland between 1914 and 1917.) Parvus had explained to Lenin that the organisation of the revolution needed money and that even more money was needed to stay in power. Parvus knew what he was talking about, since he acted as a financial 182"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"adviser to both the Turks and the Bulgarians during the Balkan wars, 1912-13. At the same time he became immensely rich through his own arms deals. Parvus had worked from Salonica in Greece, where he got into contact with the powerful local Masonic organisation. The most important force behind him was Prince Volpi di Misurata - perhaps the most powerful man in Venice - who helped Parvus with finance, deals and Masonic contacts. It was this Volpi who, in October 1922, brought the socialist-fascist Benito Mussolini into power, making the King appoint him prime minister. He was also behind the founding of Libya in 1934. Mussolini had been especially pleased with the murder of the Russian Prime Minister Stolypin, whom he called \"the tyrant by the Neva\" in an article. Volpi became minister of finance in Mussolini's government. Volpi had been in the centre of the financial circles that provoked the Balkan War in 1912-13. (The New Federalist, 11th of September 1987.) In 1916, Alexander Parvus suggested that the German government should finance Lenin and his Party still more intensively. They would be able to make a separate peace with Germany if they reached power in Petrograd. It was also clear to the Germans that the Bolsheviks would be able to efficiently weaken Russia. The Kaiser's Zionist adviser Walter Rathenau (1867-1922), who was a rich industrialist, also recommended financing the Bolsheviks. Germany's ambassador in Copenhagen, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, who was a well-known 33rd degree freemason and Illuminatus, was of the same opinion. (Nesta Webster and Kurt Kerlen, \"Boche and Bolshevik\", New York, 1923, pp. 33-34.) Parvus was close to him and had great influence over him. Parvus himself made 20 million marks from this suggestion. It was Ulrich Brockdorff-Rantzau's letter on the 14th of August 1915 which finally decided the question of financial support to the Bolsheviks. This letter, addressed to the German vice-state secretary, summarised a discussion between Brockdorff-Rantzau and Helphand-Parvus. The am- bassador strongly recommended employing Helphand to undermine Russia since \"he is an exceedingly important man, whose unusual power we should be able to utilise during the war\". But the ambassador added a warning: \"It is probably dangerous to use the forces which are behind Helphand, but if we should refuse to use their services, since we fear that we may not be able to control them, it will surely only demonstrate our 183"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"weakness.\" (Professor Z. A. B. Zeman, \"Germany and the Revolution in Russia, 1915-1918. Documents from the Archives of the German Foreign Ministry\", London, 1958, p. 4, Document 5.) Actually, the first transfer of five million marks from the German Foreign Ministry to the Bolsheviks for \"revolutionary propaganda\" had already occurred on the 7th of June 1915. The Germans' Estonian agent Aleksander Keskula acted as one of the go-betweens in the transfer. His co-operation with the Germans began on the 12th of September 1914. Keskula met Lenin for the first time on October 6, 1914. Lenin also had demands to make on the Germans. He demanded, among other things, the chance to occupy India. Some powerful American forces had exactly the same interest in using the \"revolutionaries\". It was primarily the American International Corpo- ration, with John Pierpoint Morgan Jr. (1867-1943) at the head, who tried to gain control of those international speculants and adventurers, accor- ding to Antony Sutton (doctor in economics). (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 41.) It was above all Jacob and Mortimer Schiff, Felix Warburg, Otto H. Kahn, Max Warburg, Jerome J. Hanauer, Alfred Milner and the copper family Guggenheim who financed the Bolsheviks, according to the Jewish historian David Shub. A document (861.00/5339) in the archives of the U.S. State Department confirms this. Two further names are mentioned in this document: Max Breitung and Isaac Seligman. All those people were Jews and freemasons. According to the same document, plans to depose the Tsar were made in February 1916. There are always some people who make money out of wars and revolutions. We must not forget this when we seek to understand history. The Zionist banker and freemason Max Warburg played an important role in funding the Communist propaganda in Russia. He saw to it that the industrialist Hugo Stinnes agreed to give two million roubles to the Bolsheviks' publishing activity on the 12th of August 1916. (Zeman, \"Germany and the Revolution in Russia, 1915-18. Documents from the Archives of the German Foreign Ministry\", London, 1958, p. 92.) Thus there are documents extant which show that Max Warburg and other super-wealthy Jews supported Communism. These statements are not just made up, as certain know-it-alls have claimed. Max Warburg was 184"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"the richest and most powerful banker in Germany. The periodical Hammer (No. 502, on the 15th of May 1923) called him \"the secret emperor\". Max Warburg's brother, Paul, was married to Nina Loeb, daughter of the Jewish banker Salomon Loeb. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were the most powerful United States bank syndicate. Another of Max Warburg's brothers, Felix, married Frieda Schiff, who was the daughter of Jacob Schiff. The latter was one of the most important men within Kuhn, Loeb & Co. The Schiff family and the Rothschild family owned a twin company in Frankfurt am Main as early as in the 18th century. Jacob H. Schiff was descended from a distinguished rabbinical family. He came to New York in the 1860s. It was Rothschild who trained him. Schiff began buying himself into Kuhn, Loeb & Co. with Rothschild's money. Both Paul and Felix Warburg became part owners of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Even Alexander Parvus began preparing the Bolsheviks' take-over of power in 1916. He made sure that Lenin had all the money he needed. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 34.) In this way, Lenin and Parvus received a total of six million dollars in gold. (Karl Steinhauser, \"EG - Die Super UdSSR von Morgen\", Vienna, 1992, p. 167.) Meanwhile, as many extremist Jews as possible were recruited into the \"revolutionary\" movement. The German Jew Karl Kautsky (1854-1938) emphasised that \"the Jews in Russia had only one true friend - the revolutionary movement\". The Jews then comprised 30-55 per cent of the Bolshevik Party. Dostoyevsky predicted that the Jews would enslave the Russians so that these would become pack-mules and that the Jews would drink the people's blood. Where did Russia's Jews Originate? Most Russian Jews are descendants of the Khazar Jews. According to the Russian historian and ethnologist Leon Gumilev, the Khazar Turks moved to the Volga delta in the third century A.D. Other related Turkish peoples, who used Khazaria as a base for their military operations between 558 and 650 A.D., played the most important role in the development of the Khazar Turks. In the 10th century A.D., the Khazar Turks stubbornly (and 185"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"successfully) defended themselves against the Arabs, the strongest and most aggressive military power of the day, as they expanded outward from the Arabian Peninsula. The rise of the Khazar Turks lasted for about 150 years - from the middle of the 7th century to the end of the 8th century, at which point the Jews arrested their development. The first Jews who arrived in Khazaria were fleeing just persecution for anti-government activities in Persia. A second large immigration took place in the 8th century when a large number of Jews left Byzantium to co-operate with the Arabs, which was caused by economic competition from the Greeks and the Armenians. In 723, Emperor Leo III of Byzantium attempted to force Byzantine Jews to adopt Christianity. The original population of Khazaria remained agricultural, whilst the Jewish arrivals became commercial. Jewish merchants (known as \"Ra- dokhnids\") in Khazaria immediately took control of the caravan routes between Europe and China. These new merchants were especially interes- ted in the slave trade. The Kaganate of Khazaria was a powerful kingdom. The King, or Kagan, received expensive gifts from wealthy Jews and had many Jewish women in his harem. Many children of mixed race were born in the 8th century. These children, and the Jewish people themselves, began to call them-selves Khazars in the 10th century. The original populace may be called Khazar Turks, the newcomers Khazar Jews. Semender was originally the capital of Khazaria, later being replaced as the capital by Itil (now Astrakhan) on the Volga. Other important Kha- zarian cities were Sarkel on the Dona and later Kiev on the Dniepr. There were about 4000 Jewish families in Itil. The Khazars bought military services from many contingents of mercenaries, of which there were up to 7000 in Itil. The Jews of Itil plundered the Khazar Turks unceasingly. At the beginning of the 9th century, a Jewish prophet by the name of Obadiah seized power in Khazaria and introduced a strict theocratic regime. The Kagan was not murdered, but was placed under effective house arrest. Once a year he appeared in public to make it seem as if he still wielded some power. This apparent sharing of power was just a sham. Obadiah turned the Kagan (Khan) of the Asina dynasty into his marionette and made the Mosaic faith the official state religion. This coup benefited only the Jews. 186"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Jewish rabbis did not intend to convert the Khazars to Judaism, but kept the faith exclusively for the people who had come into power. The Khazar Turks remained heathens. The coup triggered a civil war in which Obadiah exploited the tactics of total war, which had been used so successfully during the occupation of Canaan, when the Jewish nation tried to annihilate each and every enemy. By 820 A.D., the new regime was in place. Khazaria became an unnatural union, where the suppressed were constantly confronted by a foreign ruling class. The Khazar Jews were not brave warriors, and instead began terrorising the original population and other neighbouring peoples with the help of Polovtsy (Kipchaks), Peche- negs, Russian and even Islamic mercenaries. They constantly sought to expand their territories and managed to conquer the Crimea for the pur- pose of trading with the Mediterranean nations. The Khazar Jews attempted to bring about a coup in France in the middle of the 10th century with the help of their own brethren and Berber mercenaries, but before they succeeded, the slavs managed to seize power and crush the state of Khazaria. In the middle of the 9th century, Khazar Jews made an agreement with the Varangians (Vikings) to split Eastern Europe between them, but in the 10th century, the Jews took control in most areas. The Bulgars, the Mord- vins and other races came under their dominion. The Khazar Jews were at their most powerful at the end of the 9th and the beginning of the 1 Oth centuries. They threatened to bring a catastrophe upon the inhabitants of Eastern Europe. Their opponents had to choose between slavery and annihilation. Eventually, rebellions broke out. In 922, the Bulgars succeeded in freeing themselves from the oppre ssion introduced by the Jewish. Khazaria, which originally lay in the Volga delta, later extended between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and even reached all the way to Volga- Bulgaria and Kiev. Khazaria existed between the 7th century and 965 A.D. when the Prince of Kiev, Sviatoslav, crushed the Jewish reign of terror. The Khazarian potentates fled and the oppressed Khazar Turks and other peoples were freed. The surviving Khazar Jews founded the Ashkenazi tribes. Their main centres were later in the Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. The Khazar Turks mixed with other races. Most of the Khazar Turks later became 187"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"known as Astrakhan Tartars. Large areas of Khazaria later subsided into the Caspian Sea, where the traces of the great empire were discovered only in the 1960s. (Leon Gumilev, \"The Ethnosphere - The History of Man and Nature\", Moscow, 1993; Gumilev, \"The Discovery of Khazaria\", Moscow, 1996.) The Jews did not change their habits. In 1113, the Prince of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh, believed it necessary to curb the Jew's usury (\"Nordisk Familjebok\", Stockholm, 1946, Vol. 20, p. 690). The Khazar Jews repeated this tried and tested method once more when they founded the Soviet Union, which many of them regarded as a kind of twisted revenge against the Russian people. Gumilev's view is echoed by an earlier scholar, Isaac Baer Levinsohn (1788-1860), who was also certain that Russia's Jews did not come from Germany, but from the banks of the Volga. (\"The Haskalah Movement in Russia\" by Jacob Raisin, Philadelphia, 1913-1914, p. 17.) The Coup in February 1917 As early as in April 1916, the Russian freemasons had a plan ready, according to which the Tsar would be deposed and replaced by a liberal socialist Masonic government. Pavel Milyukov revealed in his memoirs how a preliminary list of the people who were to make up the Provisional Government was drawn up in P. Ryabushinsky's flat on the 13th of August 1915. The only person missing from that list was the Jewish lawyer Alexander Kerensky (actually Aaron Kiirbis). The writer and freemason Mark Aldanov (actually Landau) explained that the final list was finished in 1916 at the hotel Frantsiya. (Boris Nikolayevsky, \"The Russian Freemasons and the Russian Revolution\", Moscow, 1990, p. 164.) The list was again re-worked on the 6th of April 1916 at the house of the publicist and freemason Yekaterina Kuskova, a fact evident from a letter written by her on that day. This information, which points to the fact that there was a conspiracy behind the events in Russia in 1917, was published in the exiled Russian historian Sergei Melgunov's book \"The Preparations for the Palace Coup\" and in Grigori Aronson's book \"Russia at the Dawn of the Revolution\" (New York, 1962, p. 126). 188"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"In 1912, Zionists and Masonic circles had helped the freemason Thomas Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924) to power in the United States. As president he began working diligently to depose the Tsar of Russia. A campaign of slander was started. An agitatory campaign in 1912 led to a bloodbath by the river Lena. There were no widespread troubles, however. Russia had borrowed large amounts of money to be able to go to war. This meant that the country was especially vulnerable. According to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the international Jewish finance world handed an ultimatum to the Russian government - the Jews in the Russian society must be allowed to act as Jews. All credit was immediately suspended. Without this credit, Russia could no longer wage war. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Sazonov, confirmed that the Allies could not help Russia either, since they too relied upon the Jewish financial elite. Shcher- batov said during a meeting of the government (according to the minutes): \"We have fallen into the witches' ring. We are powerless: the money is in the hands of the Jews and without them we cannot get a single kopek...\" (A. Solzhenitsyn, \"Collected Works\", Paris, 1984, Vol. 13, pp. 263-267.) Thomas Jefferson once wrote to John Adams and said that the banking establishments were more dangerous than standing armies. (\"The Writings of Thomas Jefferson\", New York, 1899, Vol. X, p. 31.) Meanwhile, the freemasons within the Allied Forces demanded that Russia should con- tinue the war against Germany. That led the nation towards a catastrophe. B'nai B'rith and the Illuminati wanted to achieve an even greater chaos in Europe and they succeeded with this. At the international congress of Masonic Grand Masters in Interlaken, in Switzerland, on 25 June 1916 Dr. David planned to annihilate contemporary Europe. (Oleg Platonov, \"The Secret History of freemasonry\", Moscow, 1996, pp. 586-589.) In December 1916, the freemasons began working especially hard in Russia. In January 1917 it was decided that the events should begin on the Jewish Purim day, the annual celebration of the mass-murder of 75 000 Persians, according to the book of Esther in the Old Testament (9:16-26). The first shots were to be fired on the very Purim day - the 23 rd of February (8th of March). The Jewish weekly newspaper Yevreiskaya Nedelya (the Jewish Week) published an article about the \"February revolution\" on the 24th of March 1917 (No. 12-13) with an especially revealing title: \"It Happened on Purim Day!\" (i. e. the 23rd of February 1917). 189"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The freemasons began making intense propaganda to have the Tsar deposed. The slogan \"For democracy! Against Tsarism!\" was used. Of course, all this cost a lot of money, which mostly came from the United States. Jacob Schiff declared publicly in April 1917 that it was through his financial support that the revolution in Russia had succeeded. The freemasons exploited the food shortage. The \"revolutionaries\" provoked people to come out on political strikes. The freemasons wanted to carry out the Bolshevik take-over in two steps... The myth says that the troubles, which brought about a social revolt and then a revolution, were spontaneous. Professor Richard Pipes at Harvard University in the United States rejects that description. He states: \"Historians have claimed that the revolutionaries were carried forward by the people. But if we go to the sources, it is evident that they are wrong on all points and build their ideas on myths.\" He emphasises: \"The February revolution in Petrograd in 1917 was not, as we have believed, a social uprising - and this can easily be proved.\" According to him, the spark that set it all off was the mutiny in the overfilled barracks on the 23rd of February (8th March). It had been necessary to recruit older people, since many Russian soldiers had been taken prisoner. But the mutineers were not against the war, as was later believed. The Bolsheviks knew that peace was an unpopular demand. The peasants wanted land and they got it. (Dagens Nyheter, 6th May 1992.) The agitators transformed this insignificant uprising into a revolution on the 27th of February (12th of March) 1917, and three days later, on the 2nd (15th) of March, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate. He was then staying in Pskov. Nicholas II left his crown to his youngest brother Mikhail, but the freemasons were furious over the fact that they had not quite succeeded in abolishing the imperial regime in three days flat and on the following day they forced Mikhail to abdicate too. Their goal was to crush the empire altogether. An Irish member of the British Parliament revealed that Alfred Milner, Grand Master of British freemasonry and leader of the secret group The Round Table (which was funded by the Rothschild family, according to the historian Gary Allen), had been sent ahead to Petrograd in order to depose the Tsar. \"Our leaders... sent Lord Milner to Petrograd to prepare the revolution...\" (Zeman, \"Germany and the Revolution in Russia 1915- 190"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"18. Documents from the Archives of the German Foreign Ministry\", London, 1958, p. 92.) The MP protested over the fact that the British treated their allies in such a manner. No one denied the statement. (\"Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons.\" Vol. 91, No. 218, 1917, 22nd of March, col. 2081.) Later, the same Milner spent 21 million roubles on the Bolsheviks' take-over... Gary Allen claimed that The Round Table is also fully responsible for the Second World War. The prime mover behind the fall of the Tsar was the 36-year-old Jewish lawyer Alexander Kerensky who, during the years preceding the coup had exclusively defended \"revolutionary\" terrorists. Alexander Kerensky, according to the historian Sergei Yemelyanov, was a freemason of the 33rd degree. He was even Grand Master in the Russian branch of Grand Orient in 1916, according to the historian Sergei Naumov. He had found docu-ments confirming this. Alexander Kerensky was the son of the Austrian Jewess Adler who married the Jew Kurbis, according to the historian Sergei Naumov. His real name was Aaron. His mother later married the teacher Fiodor Kerensky who adopted the boy Aaron. Fiodor Kerensky was first a teacher and later headmaster at the public school in Simbirsk where Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin also studied for a while. He was eventually named school inspector in Turkistan. In connection with his adoption, Aaron was given a Christian name - Alexander. Alexander Kerensky's doctor confirmed that he was circumcised. (F. Winberg, \"The Cross-Roads\", Munich, 1922, p. 197.) The Jew Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich (a close collaborator with Lenin) confirmed that Kerensky was already a freemason when he was a member of the National Duma. Here it should again be pointed out that the terrorist Dmitri (Mordekai) Bogrov co-operated closely with Kerensky who, after the murder of Prime Minister Peter Stolypin, fled abroad immediately, according to the historian O. Soloviev. One of those behind Kerensky was the American freemason and government official Richard Crane, according to Antony Sutton. He was primarily financed by the Jewish banker Grigori Berenson who later moved with his family to London, where his daughter Flora married Colonel Harold Solomon. This man was one of the most important Jews in London. In the 1930s Grigori Berenson began an active Zionist campaign. 191"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" The Austrian political scientist Karl Steinhauser revealed that the British ambassador, the freemason George Buchanan, was the contact man between Kerensky and London, Paris and Washington. Other high-ranking freemasons within the Grand Orient worked together with Kerensky to have the Tsar deposed: the lawyer Maxim Vinaver (1866-1940), the lawyer Oskar Grusenberg (1866-1940), the historian Alexander Braudo (1864-1924), the writer Leonti (Leon) Bramson, the lawyer Joseph Hessen (1866-1943), the lawyer Y. Frumkin, Yoller and M. Herzenstein. The contacts with the Grand Orient in France were organised by Sergei Urusov. (Boris Nikolayevsky, \"Russian Freemasonry and the Revolution\", Moscow, 1990, pp. 56-57.) Urusov was a landowner and a freemason who betrayed the Tsar. In 1917 he became Minister for Internal Affairs in the Provisional Government. After the Bolsheviks' take-over, he took a high post in the Central Bank. (The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia, Vol. 56, Moscow, 1936, p. 301.) The second in command after Kerensky was Nikolai Nekrasov. It should not be necessary to point out at this stage that the Illuminati controlled the Grand Orient. 192"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"During the new Tsar's coronation a cross of St. Andrew, which had adorned his ceremonial dress, fell to the floor. A few hours later a terrible panic broke out among the crowd who had come to Moscow to see the new Tsar. Through rumours, people imagined that the gifts which used to be handed out in connection with coronations would not be enough for all the poor this time. The crowd pressed forward and about two thousand people were suffocated or trampled to death. Millions of Russians saw this event as a bad omen. The Tsar, meanwhile, did not break off his cele- bration, but continued on to the ball at the French Embassy. The superstitious were proved right... There are historians who still have not understood why so many important tsarist generals betrayed Nicholas II. The Tsar said repeatedly that he had been betrayed. But now this riddle has also been solved. The most important generals, according to the Jewish freemason Manuil Margulies, were Masonic brothers who obeyed their lodge instead of the Tsar. Among these generals, he mentioned Vasili Romeiko-Gurko, Mikhail Alexeyev (1857-1918), who later founded the White Army, Nikolai Ruzsky, Alexander Krymov, Al exei Manikovsky, Alexei Poli- vanov, Alexander Myshlayevsky, Tepl ov, even Lavr Kornilov, who was ordered to inform the Tsar and his family that they were all under arrest. Kornilov later broke away from the freemasons. (M. Nazarov, Nash Sovremennik, No. 12, 1991.) The Tsar Nicholas II was also betrayed by the right-wing member of the National Assembly, Alexander Guchkov, who became Minister for War in the Provisional Government. He later regretted his action and took part in Kornilov's revolt, but it was already too late. Even members of the Romanov dynasty betrayed the Tsar. On the 2nd (15th) of March, the freemasons had, after the American model, formed a provisional governm ent led by Prince Georgi Lvov (1861-1925). That was why the Jewish freemasons were so angry with Mikhail II for holding power simultaneously. This error was corrected one day later. Mikhail II was ritually murdered in Perm on June 12, 1918. Every one of the eleven ministers was a freemason. Of course, all the most important freemasons were there: Nikolai Nekrasov (Minister of Com- munications), Alexander Kerensky (Min ister of Justice), Pavel Milyukov (the Minister of Foreign Affairs, professor and leader of the bourgeois Cadet Party) and Mikhail Tereshchenko (Minister of Finance). The Zionist 193"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"and freemason Piotr Rutenberg, also an infamous terrorist, was named chief of police by Kerensky. Kerensky and Rutenberg had all the crim inals in the prisons released. There were 183 949 prisoners in Russia in 1912. There were tens of thousands of criminals just in Petrograd. This took place on the second day of the coup. The prison gates in other cities were also opened wide. Then the anarchy began. Criminals raided stores, shops and railway carriages. People were murdered and robbed. Nothing of the sort had ever been seen before. The first victims of the February coup were the policemen. The crowds seized them, beat them to death and dragged their corpses around in the streets. The police force was nearly liquidated. Then the killing of officers began. During the first days of the coup, 60 officers were killed in Kronstadt alone, among others Admiral von Wiren. Both his arms were chopped off, after which he was led around the streets until the \"revolutionaries\" were merciful enough to kill him. In Vyborg, officers were thrown onto rocks from a bridge. In other areas officers were impaled on bayonets. Everywhere people mocked them and tore off their shoulder-straps, following which they were beaten to death, according to Stanislav Govorukhin. The Masonic government did not wish to use the national anthem \"God Save the Tsar\", composed, ironically, by Prince Lvov himself and written by the poet Zhukovsky by request of Tsar Nicholas I. Instead a Masonic anthem, \"The Lord Glorious in Zion\", was used. German military orchestras played most of the gramophone recordings of this national anthem (from February to October 1917). (Staffan Skott, \"Sovjetunionen fran borjan till slutet\" / \"The Soviet Union from Beginning to End\", Stockholm, 1993, pp. 23-24.) It was later asserted that the press and public opinion of the United States forced the Tsar to abdicate. These claims could not explain the mystery behind the so-called February revolution. Simon Dubnov (1860- 1940), a known Zionist, openly admitted that the February revolution took place thanks to the freemasons' intrigues behind the scenes. (Alexander Braudo, \"Notes and Recollections\", Paris, 1937, p. 48.) The freemasons controlled all the political parties. The Soviets (kahals) from the autumn of 1905 were re-established in connection with this conspiracy. They were supposed to represent the soldiers and workers. This was also a myth, since the freemason Nikolai 194"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Chkheidze became the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Alexander Kerensky was a member of the Petrograd \"Workers' Council\", which was a faithful replica of the kahal organisation in New York. He was also a member of the committee of the National Duma. Similarities to the Deposition of the Shah A similar Masonic plot with the aid of the Western financial elite led to the deposition of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as he himself revealed on Contadora Island, Panama, in the first television interview with him after his fall. The Shah said to the reporter David Frost (of the BBC): \"Do you think that Khomeini, an uneducated person... could have planned all of this, organised everything? I also know that fantastic sums were staked. I know that top experts on propaganda were used to depict us as tyrants and beasts and the others as democratic, liberal revolutionaries who wanted to save the country. I know that the BBC was also against us. We have all the information... It occurred like a very well-planned conspiracy... they staked about 250 million dollars... Wherever he (Khomeini) had been in Europe, he would probably have had the same possibilities and the same accomplices. I do not believe that he himself was in charge of the planning... Yazdi was an American citizen, Ghotbzadeh was expelled from Georgetow n University because he couldn't keep up with his studies...\" David Frost: \"So Khomeini might have received some kind of support from the West?\" The Shah: \"How else could all these factors have been combined at the same time?\" (Translator's note: The above interview is a paraphrase of the original since it has been re-translated from Swedish.) When I wrote to Sveriges Television (Sweden's national television) and asked for a copy of the text of the translation, I was officially told that the text no longer existed. But I came into personal contact with a member of the editorial staff. Through this contact I obtained the complete text. An evident example of how facts are concealed! I must remark here that the Russian Tsar was deposed after the same pattern - everything pointed to an international conspiracy. 195"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The American press painted a monstrous picture of the Tsar Nicholas II. That was why the American public was so happy with his deposition. The unfair propaganda continues to this day. The most audacious lies came from the historian Hans Villius on the 1st of September 1991 in a Swedish television program about the \"history\" of the Soviet Union. He claimed that the revolution began as a result of the tsarist regime's bloody terror against the population. He never mentioned any numbers. Every true historian knows that a total of 467 people (i.e. murderers) were executed in Russia between 1826 and 1904. (Professor Vittorio Strada's article \"Death Penalties and the Russian Revolutions\", Oboz- reniye, No. 14, p. 25, Paris, 1984.) This comes to 6 death sentences per year. Was this really terror? How many were killed during the same period in the United States of America? How many Indians were eliminated during the same period? Here I shall just mention the massacre at Wounded Knee where govern- ment soldiers murdered three hundred unarmed Indians, including women and children, on the 29th of December 1890. Hans Villius never mentioned the Bolsheviks' cold-blooded mass- murders, which amounted to 66 million in the beginning and later reached a total of 143 million, according to the English researcher Philipp van der Est. That, it seems, was not terror according to Villius. Even the Bolshe- viks called their own purge \"the Red Terror\". Hans Villius did everything in his power to twist the truth and thereby uphold the myths. The Return of Lenin and Trotsky The conspiracy continued. Trotsky was sent from New York with an American passport on March 26, 1917. Jacob Schiff began financing him in the spring of 1917. In this way the Bolsheviks received via Trotsky a total of 20 million dollars, according to Hillaire Belloc, Gary Allen and other historians. John Schiff also admitted in the New York Journal American on February 3, 1949 that his grandfather \"sank about 20 million dollars for the final triumph of Bolshevism\". Thus he spent millions of dollars to depose the Tsar and then laid out even more money to help the Bolsheviks to power... 196"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Now it was time for Lenin to return as well. When he first read in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung that the Tsar had been deposed, he thought it was German propaganda. On the 31st of March the German vice-state secretary informed Ambassador Gisbert von Romberg in Bern with a cipher-telegram: \"The Russian revolutionaries' journey through Germany should take place as soon as possible, since the Allies have already begun counter-actions in Switzerland. If possible, the negotiations should be speeded up!\" Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau (1869-1928) sent a strictly secret telegram from Copenhagen to the Ministry of the Interior in Berlin on April 2, 1917: \"We must immediately try to bring about as wide-spread chaos as possible in Russia. At the same time, we must avoid visibly involving ourselves in the course of the Russian revolution. But in secret we should do everything to increase the antagonism between the moderate and extreme parties, since we are quite interested in the victory of the latter because the coup d'etat would then be unavoidable.\" Brockdorff-Rantzau was foreign minister during the Weimar Republic and ambassador in Moscow from 1922. Lenin signalled to the German government on the 4th of April that he was ready to return to Russia. His journey was approved by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who belonged to the Bethmann banking family in Frankfurt am Main, and by State Secretary Arthur Zimmermann. Then these men proceeded to organise the journey together with Count Brockdorff-Rantzau and Alexander Parvus. They thought it best if Lenin travelled through Sweden, where he would be joined by their contact man, Jakub Furstenberg-Hanecki (Ganetsky). (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\" (Morley, 1981, p. 40). Ganetsky was called \"the hands and feet of the party\". On the 9th of April, Lenin and his group began their journey from Bern to Russia. Before they had left Zurich, they heard cries of: \"German spies! Traitors!\" from the platform. The German General Staff could not imagine that the Bolsheviks would ever turn against Germany and Europe. The German Major General Max Hoffman later wrote: \"We neither knew nor foresaw the danger to humanity from the consequences of th is journey of the Bolsheviks to Russia.\" (Antony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 40.) 197"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"According to the author Hans Bjorkegren, the carriage in which Lenin and his 32 companions travelled was not sealed, as another myth has it.

(Akim Arutiunov, \"The Pheno- menon Vladimir Ulyanov/Lenin\", Moscow, 1992, p. 61.) Lenin's company was to join together with Trotsky's in Petrograd and eventually begin a take-over of power from the Provisional Government together with other leading forces to introduce the Communist (i.e. Judaist) dictatorship. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II learned about the operation when Lenin had already reached Russia. The Germans' motive was to obtain a separate peace treaty and later advantages in trade with Russia. Lenin only wanted a Communist dictatorship and the Russians' wealth. German patriots did not suspect that dark Illuminist forces were only using official Germany to camouflage their own activities... Lenin's travelling companions were mostly Jewish extremists. 19 of them were Bolsheviks. Here I shall name only the most important among these: Nadezhda Krupskaya, Olga (Sarra) Ravich, Grigori Zinoviev (actually Ovsei Gershen Radomyslsky), his wife Slata Radomyslskaya, their eight-year-old son Stefan Radomyslsky, Moisei Kharitonov (Marko- vich, who became Petrograd's chief of militia), Grigori Sokolnikov (actually Brilliant, editor of Pravda and later People's Commissary for Banking Affairs), David Rosenblum (whom Stalin jailed in 1937, in Leningrad), Alexander Abramovich (who became an important functio- nary within Comintern), Grigori Usiyevich (actually Tinsky), Yelena Usiyevich-Kon (daughter of a well-k nown Jewish Bolshevik, Felix Kon, from Poland), Abram Skovno, Simon Scheineson, Georgi Safarov, Zalman Ryvkin, Dunya Pogovskaya (an activist within the Jewish Workers' Union Bund), her four-year-old son Ruvin, Ilya Miringov (Mariengof), Maria Miringova, Mikhail Goberman (who became a powerful functionary within Comintern), Meier Kivev Aizenud (Aizentuch), Shaya Abra- movich, Fanya Grebelskaya (Bun), Lenin's lover Inessa Armand (who was born on the 16th of June, 1875, in Paris). Lenin's journey was regarded as so important that the Crown Prince's train had to stop for two hours in Halle until Lenin's train had passed.

When the group arrived in Malmo, Brockdorff-Rantzau im- mediately reported to Berlin. Lenin arrived at Stockholm's Central Station just before ten o'clock in the morning on Friday the 13th of April 1917. Karl Radek (Tobiach Sobel- sohn), another important freemason and \"revolutionary\", arrived together with him but remained in the Swedish capital to help Jakub Hanecki (Ftirstenberg). It was this same Hanecki (known as Ganetsky) who channelled the German money to the Bolsheviks in Petrograd via Nya Banken (the New Bank) in Stockholm and the freemason Olof Aschberg (Obadiah Asch). Karl Radek, an Austrian citizen, showed his \"gratitude\" to the Germans by later taking part in terrorist activities against the German Kaiser and preparing a plot to depose him. MOPR or the Red Aid later gave Karl Radek the task of provoking the German workers to a \"proletarian revolution\". He was a member of the Central Committee. Stalin had him arrested in 1937. Radek readily gave evidence against other Bolsheviks but this did not save him. Three new conspirators joined Lenin's group in Stockholm: Rakhil Skovno, Yuri Kos and Alexander Grakas. The aim of the conspirators was to enforce Illuminist rule in Russia after the model of Weishaupt-Hess-Marx. There was a reserve plan for a Communist base in case the take-over failed. The Communists had chosen Sweden for this purpose, according to Solzhenitsyn's book \"Lenin in Zurich\" (Paris, 1975, p. 168). The Swedish Social Democrats helped those Bolshevik criminals by all means possible. Lenin and his fellow criminals were allowed to use Sweden as their most important base for the planned state terrorism in Russia, thanks to the freemason and socialist leader Hjalmar Branting and the helpful attitude of the Swedish Social Democrats. (Dagens Nyheter, 5th of November 1985, p. 4.) They also helped to organise the Bolsheviks' Fourth Party Congress in Folkets Hus (the Social Democrat centre) in Stockholm in April-May 1906. Branting gave the speech of welcome at the congress. Branting also knew about the financing of the Bolsheviks' activities (\"Vem betalade ryska revolutionen?\" / \"Who Paid for the Russian Revolution?\", Svenska Dagbladet, 31st October 1985). 199"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Stockholm's socialist mayor Carl Lindhagen met Lenin and his companions on the platform at Stockholm's Central Station. Parvus had also travelled to Stockholm to meet Lenin, according to one source. There was one socialist politician, Erik Palmstierna, who guessed how dangerous Lenin could become and therefore suggested organising a police provocation at the station and have Lenin shot in the resulting tumult. The others just laughed at him (Svenska Dagbladet, 21st October 1990). Palmstierna became minister for naval defence on the 19th of October 1917. Lenin stayed just over eight hours in Stockholm. He spent most of that time at the Hotel Regina on Drottninggatan. He continued to Haparanda at 6:37 on the same evening. Before his departure, the Swedish socialists had time to buy a suit and the world-famous cap for him at PUB (a department store in Stockholm). (Aftonbladet, 28th August 1989.) At the same time Lenin met Hans Steinwachs, a representative of the German Foreign Ministry. Steinwachs was the chief of German espionage in Scandinavia, according to Hans Bjorkegren's book \"Ryska posten\" / \"The Russian Post\" (Stockholm, 1985, p. 264). The Polish Jew Moisei (Mieczyslaw) Bronski-Warszawski, who travel- led under a false name, was also among Lenin's companions. He was still in Bern on the 7th of April, but joined Lenin in Stockholm on the 13th April. The Swedish socialist Fredrik Strim, who was responsible for the reception of the conspirators, confirmed this. Steinwachs sent the following telegram to Berlin on the 17th of April: \"Lenin's journey to Russia went well. He will do precisely what we wish from him.\" (Zeman, \"Germany and the Revolution in Russia 1915-18: Documents from the Archives of the German Foreign Ministry\", London, 1958, p. 51.) It was the minister of justice in the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, who directly invited Lenin and Trotsky to Russia. He made Prime Minister Georgi Lvov and the Minister of Foreign affairs Pavel Milyukov send instructions to that effect, which were revealed in Nesta Webster's book \"Boche and Bolshevik\" (New York, 1923, p. 19). To- wards the end of April, Milyukov no longer wanted to be a member of this government and so he resigned.

The government had been strongly influenced by the socialists. The Russian Provisional Government paid for the tickets for the journey from Stockholm to Haparanda and from there to Petrograd. Lenin later claimed that he was not welcome in Russia and that he lacked a visa. He even asserted that the Provisional Government would have imprisoned him, since he travelled without permission. This is all just Soviet propaganda. The whole company was given a group visa by the Russian Consulate General in Stockholm (except for Fritz Platten, since he was not a Russian citizen). This visa is still preserved in the Helsinki City Archives, where it can be seen that it was first issued on the 13th of April 1917. Lenin and his 29 travelling compani ons are all on the list. Some (Karl Radek for instance) remained behind. Three new conspirators joined instead. This was revealed by Hans Bjorkegren in his book \"The Russian Post\" (Stockholm, 1985). Lenin wanted to appear as an exceedingly poor revolutionary. That was why he began with his beggar antics in Switzerland, which he later conti- nued in Sweden. Of course, he did not say a word about the fact that he had also begged for money from the Bolsheviks' secret fund in Stockholm. He received up to 3000 crowns from this source, according to Hans Bjorkegren. Alexander Parvus had founded this fund by the aid of the banker Max Warburg. I telephoned the headquarters of Svenska Handelsbanken (Swedish Bank of Commerce) on January 24, 1991 and asked how much 3000 crowns were worth in 1917. This money was equivalent to 56 250 crowns (approximately £5000) in 1991. 3000 crowns were nearly equivalent to two years of a worker's wages (3256 crowns). I must point out here that a worker with an annual income of 1628 crowns in 1917 could support his wife and children. In 1991, the workers received an average of 120 000 crowns per year. It is impossible to support a wife and children with this wage without also relying on the wife's salary and various benefits (child benefit, housing benefit, etc). That is to say: 3000 crowns then might actually have been closer in value to 350 000 crowns in 2002. Lenin was not content with this. In Haparanda he received a further 300 crowns (more than two months' wages for a worker) as a contribution from the Russian consul.

In 1913 the Swedish worker earned an average of 135 crowns per month (135 x 100 = 13 500 today, 1350 US dollars). Mikhail Goberman had scrounged together another 1000 Swiss francs. The Swiss socialists had, through Fritz Platten, donated a further 3000 Swiss francs to Lenin. Platten, by the way, was in charge of solving all practical problems during the journey. The Bolsheviks of Petrograd sent another 500 roubles. Lenin sent begging-letters to Swedish socialists too, who managed to scrape together several hundred crowns. Those socialists had no idea that Lenin actually had plenty of money. At the end of March he had written to Inessa Armand: \"There is even more money than I expected for the journey.\" Lenin could never get enough. The trade unionist Fabian Mansson organised a collection among the members of parliament. Even right-wing politicians gave money to Lenin, since comrade Mansson had pointed out that the Bolsheviks would be in power in Russia as early as the next day. The Swedish Foreign Minister Arvid Lindman gave Lenin 100 crowns (a lot of money then). The Swedish refugee committee gave Lenin 3000 crowns as well. A second class ticket from Stockholm to Haparanda only cost 30 crowns in 1917. Besides, the Russian government paid for all the tickets! In Finland, Lenin continued his journey to Petrograd, but now travelling third class so that the Russians receiving him would see how poor he was... That was the way Lenin's journey to Russia was organised. He arrived at Petrograd's Finland station at 11:10 in the evening of the 16th of April. The freemason Nikolai Chkheidze, who was the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, came with flowers to meet him. Chkeidze even gave a speech of welcome. Stalin was not among those at the reception. Not one photograph confirms Stalin's presence, despite the fact that he later claimed to have been there. There was even an armoured car waiting there. Lenin jumped up onto the car and held an agitatory speech at once. Lenin was much worse at public speaking than Trotsky, according to the Swedish Communist Anton Nilson. Lenin was later welcomed at the Winter Palace by a representative of the Provisional Government, the Minister for Employment Mikhail Skobelev, who was a Menshevik and a freemason. 202"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"In April 1917, there were still many British agents in Petrograd who provoked the soldiers to mutiny and gave them money. On the 7th of April, General Yanin received a complete report about the actions and hiding places of these British agents. This report is still extant. In May, another still larger group of 200 \"revolutionaries\", led by the Menshevik L. Martov and Pavel Axelr od, arrived from Switzerland. Many others followed after. Some of those conspirators travelled on credit. The Board of Swedish National Railways desperately tried to collect the 30 000 crowns owed to them, but were just laughed at by the \"revo- lutionaries\", according to Hans Bjorkegren. They believed they were exercising their \"revolutionary\" right not to pay. Thousands of Jewish conspirators came also from the United States. A total of 25 000 international \"revolutionaries\" arrived in Russia. Dr George A. Simons, the priest at the American Embassy, related the following about these events: \"There were hundreds of agitators who had followed Trotsky from New York. We were surprised at the fact that the Jewish element dominated from the very beginning.\" Lenin began publishing a large number of newspapers and periodicals, a total of 41, including 17 daily newspapers. The circulation of Pravda in- creased from 3000 copies to 300 000 in May 1917. It was given out free, also among the soldiers at the German front. The newspaper, which was financed by the Germans, propagated a separate peace with Germany. The German Minister of Foreign Affairs, Richard von Kiihlmann, wrote to the Kaiser Wilhelm II on December 3, 1917: \"It was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of funds through the various channels and under varying labels that they were in a position to be able to build up their organ Pravda, to conduct energetic propaganda and appreciably to extend the originally narrow base of their party.\" (Anthony Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution,\" p. 39.) The Bolsheviks even bought a printing office for 260 000 roubles, according to the findings of the historian Dmitri Volkogonov. But the Bolsheviks remained unpopular despite their vast propaganda machine. The United States Congress had declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Among the people who had worked hardest to draw America into the world war were the bankers George Blumenthal and Isaac Seligman, the industrialists Daniel Guggenheim and Adolf Lewisohn, as well as the rabbis David Philipson (1862-1949) and Stephen Samuel Wise. 203"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The rabbi Isaac Wise (1819-1900), chairman of the B'nai B'rith lodge in Cincinnati, has explained: \"Freemasonry is a Jewish institution whose history, degrees, charges, passwords and explanations are Jewish from beginning to end.\" (The Israelite of America, 3rd of August 1866.) Of course, billions were made on the First World War. President Wilson \"promised\" that this would be the last war in the history of man. The freemason Winston Churchill emphasised that if the Americans had not entered the First World War, peace would have been made with Germany and the Russian Tsar would not have been deposed. Then the Bolsheviks would not have been able to reach power either. {Social Justice Magazine, No 3, 1st of July 1939, p. 4.) B'nai B'rith and the Illuminati wanted to create even greater chaos in Europe, which they succeeded in doing. At the international conference of Masonic Grand Masters in Interlaken, Switzerland, on the 25th of June 1916, Dr David promised that the Jews, after causing great bloodbaths of Aryans, will take control over the whole world. (Oleg Platonov, \"The Secret History of Freemasonry\", Moscow, 1996, p. 589.) The Bolshevik slogans were: \"Peace! Bread! Land!\" and \"All power to the Soviets!\" The same slogans were used at the Jacobin coup in France in 1789, since the Jacobin slogan was: \"All power to the bourgeoisie!\" The Bolsheviks could act freely. Lenin himself admitted after his arrival in Petrograd that Russia was the freest nation in the world. The Bolsheviks were unsuccessful at the beginning. The Mensheviks and Social Revolu- tionaries, who supported the Provisional Government, dominated the Soviets. Despite this, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs, Richard von Kiihlmann, reported to his ambassador in Bern: \"Those who support Lenin's peace policy are growing in number. Pravda's circulation has in- creased to 300 000.\" The Bolsheviks organised several large demonstrations in May and June. Comrade Alexander Kerensky, meanwhile, wanted to set up a Russian revolutionary army. Freemasonry was legalised in Russia on the 24th of June 1917. In the beginning of Ju ly, Trotsky officially went over to the Bolshevik Party, where he was immediately made one of the most important leaders. 204"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Revelations in the Press The Bolsheviks of the lower ranks were very eager to seize power as soon as possible. Trotsky and Lenin believed that the astrological time was not right yet! Some Bolshevik leaders, however, began acting on the 3rd (16th) of July. Trotsky agitated to restrain the Red Guards. He gave a speech before the Tauridian Palace where he said outright: \"Go home! Calm down!\" The situation exploded anyway on the 4th (17th) of July. Attempts at a coup d'etat were underway. At the same time, the Germans launched a new offensive at the front. Prince Lvov and his government were nearly ready to leave their posts. It was really too early. The freemasons made a desperate attempt to halt this development. They had sensitive material delivered to the Russian authorities. On the 4th (17th) of July, the French attache Pierre Laurent had visited Colonel Boris Nikitin, then chief of the Russian Secret Service. (H. Bjorkegren, \"Ryska posten\", Stockholm, 1985, p. 262.) He gave Nikitin copies of 29 telegrams from Lenin, Ganetsky, Kollontay, Sumenson, Kozlovsky and Zinoviev and three letters to Lenin. All that material was very revealing. The information was immediately leaked to the newspapers by patriotic forces. Rumours that the press in Petrograd was going to publish revelatory articles on Lenin, Zinoviev and Trotsky began circulating on the same afternoon. Zinoviev later claimed that Lenin had discussed the question of the take-over in the Tauridian Palace on the 3rd (16th) of July. This was incorrect, since Lenin was in Bonch-Bruyevich's villa in Finland then, and returned only on the 4th (17th) of July. (Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 30.) The Bolshevik leaders were worried and began working more actively. No one had time for coup plans any longer. Stalin persuaded Nikolai Chekheidze to telephone the editorial staffs of the newspapers and prohibit the publication of those sensitive documents. Stalin understood as well as the other Bolshevik leaders that the di sclosure of that information would damage the Bolsheviks also in the long term. Even the Provisional Government wanted to sweep the whole business under the carpet at this point. They did not want to take any measures whatever. 205"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"There was one small newspaper, The Living Word, which ignored the prohibition and published the Social Revolutionaries Grigori Alexinsky's and Vasili Pankratov's article about the German funding of Lenin's party on the 5 th (18th) of July. That was another reason why Lenin began to hate the right wing faction of the Social Revolutionaries. In their article, the authors presented various excerpts from those documents, which showed that the Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Lenin, had been given money for his agitatory campaign by the Germans through a certain Mr. Svensson who worked at the German Embassy in Stockholm. Lenin had received money and instructions from reliable people like Jakub Furstenberg alias Yakov Ganetsky and Alexander Parvus in Stockholm and Ganetsky's relative, the Jewess Yevgenia (Dora) Sumenson (actually Simmons) in Petrograd. She worked at the Fabian Klingsland firm in Petrograd and had lived in Sweden and made business trips to Denmark during the war. She also worked with speculations on the stock market. The German money was transferred from the German Imperial Bank in Berlin via Nya Banken in Stockholm to the Bank of Siberia in Petrograd. All this according to Hans Bjorkegren. Another who received this German money was the Jewish Bolshevik la wyer Mieczyslaw Kozlowski from Poland. He was in constant contact with Alexander Parvus and Jakub Fiirstenberg. German Imperial Bank had, according to order 7433 of the 2nd of March, opened accounts for Lenin, Trotsky, Ganetsky, Kollontay, Koz- lovsky (Kozlowski), Sumenson and ot her important Bolsheviks. Not only Lenin was involved in shady financial transfers, but also Trotsky, Zinoviev, Sverdlov, Dzerzhinsky, Kollontay, Josef (Isidor) Steinberg, Volodarsky, Ganetsky, Kozlowski, R adek, Uritsky, Menzhinsky, Yoffe and a few others. On the same day, the 5th (18th) of July, Pavel Pereverzev, the minister of justice, was made the official scapegoat for the fact that those secret documents had leaked to the press, and was forced to resign. It was claimed that the government first wanted a thorough investigation into the Bolsheviks' alleged high treason. The Bolsheviks' premature attempt to take over power ended.

Why it was too early was not explained. That was why the students were taught that what happened on the 3-4th (16-17th) of July was just a \"peaceful July demonstration\". On the 6th (19th) of July, Lenin published a defensive article in the newspaper Listok Pravdy, where he angrily repudiated the accusations against him as a \"rotten invention\" of the bourgeoisie. Lenin averred never to have met Sumenson and to have nothing in common with Kozlowski and Furstenberg. Lenin was not convincing in his unashamedness, however, and his letters showed the opposite of what his article said. Nor could he explain where he obtained the money to give out 17 different daily newspapers, whose total circulation amounted to 1.4 million copies every week. (Vladimir Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 35, Moscow, p. 260.) Trotsky tried to maintain that the money came from the workers. But could the workers really collect hundreds of thousands of roubles every week just to support the Bolsheviks when there were other labour parties, which were more popular than they were? Trotsky convinced no one with his blatant lies. On the 6th (19th) of July, other newspapers also began publishing telegrams reporting transfers of Ge rman money to the Bolsheviks in Petrograd under various innocent pretexts. (David Shub, \"Russian Political Heritage\", New York, 1969.) In Lenin's official biography (p. 177), all these accusations were re- garded as libel on the part of the provocateurs. On the evening of the 6th (19th) of July in Margarita Fofanova's flat, Lenin said to Stalin: \"If the least fact in connection with the money transfers is confirmed, it would be exceedingly naive to believe that we should be able to avoid death sentences.\" (Akim Arutiunov, \"The Phenomenon Vladimir Ulyanov /Lenin\", Moscow, 1992, p. 73.) He might have believed so, but he was wrong. The government knew that Lenin had sent a letter to Ganetsky and Radek in Stockholm on the 12th (25th) of April 1917, in which he told them: \"I have received the money from you!\" That the Provisional Government knew about these shady affairs and had access to Lenin's secret letters is proved in the periodical Proletarskaya Revolyutsya (The Proletarian Revolution) which, in the autumn of 1923, published several of Lenin's strictly secret letters. He had sent one of those letters from 207"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Petrograd to Ganetsky in Stockholm on April 21st (4th of May). He wrote: \"The money (two thousand) from Kozlowski got here.\" The editorial staff had obtained the letters from the Archive of the Revolution in Petrograd. The chief of that archive, N. Sergievsky, related that the letters had been found in the archives of the Provisional Government's Department of Justice. Thus the Provisional Government copied all of Lenin's letters, knew about his illegal activities and were even aware that Lenin had contact with a German spy, Georg Slarz, but took no measures whatever. On the contrary, they connived with the Bo lsheviks. N. Sergievsky, who sent those copies to the periodical Proletarskaya Revolyutsya without knowing what the letters contained, disappeared without trace in 1926. (Akim Arutiunov, \"The Phenomenon Vladimir Ulyanov/Lenin\", Moscow, 1992, p. 73.) The most sensational thing was that the Provisional Government's agent in Stockholm helped the Bolsheviks smuggle some of the German money into Petrograd in a courier's bag. (H. Bjorkegren, \"Ryska posten\", Stock- holm, 1985, p. 137.) This was evident from Lenin's correspondence with Ganetsky-Fiirstenberg. All this was extremely embarrassing for the Provisional Government. Ganetsky-Fiirstenberg was on his way to Petrograd from Stockholm with important party documents just before the revelations. He learned about the scandal in Haparanda and cancelled his journey. He stayed in Haparanda at first, then returned to Stockholm to be on the safe side. His representative, Solomon Chakowicz, a Polish Jew, stayed in Haparanda with his luggage. The French military attache Pierre Laurent sent an agent to Haparanda to steal Furstenberg's luggage. Whether he was successful has not yet been revealed. Parvus rapidly disappeared from Copenhagen and turned up again in Switzerland in the wake of this scandal. He never answered Radek's and Furstenberg's telegrams where they asked him to deny the accusations. He preferred to keep quiet. Of course, Parvus was scared. Perhaps he feared that information about his role in the February coup would be revealed in connection with the money transfers. Later, however, he claimed that he had pulled many of the strings whilst living at Stureplan in Central Stockholm and that the troubles had been provoked. 208"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Because of the concrete proof against Lenin, the chief prosecutor had no other choice but to begin an investigation into his activity. During the investigation it was revealed that there were 180 000 roubles on Yevgenia Sumenson's bank account and that a further 750 000 had been successively transferred during a period of six months from Nya Banken in Stockholm. (A. Karayev, \"Lenin\".) A telegram from Sumenson read: \"Have Nya Banken send a further 100 000.\" She had earlier received a total of just over two million. A lot more money had been transferred to the lawyer Kozlowski's account - 1.3 million a month. There was no longer any choice - Lenin was accused of treason to his fatherland and espionage. On the 7th (20th) of July the Provisional Government wrote an order of arrest for Lenin, Grigori Zinoviev and Leon Kamenev (Rosenfeld). The latter was editor-in-chief of Pravda (Truth). A writ was also issued. The bourgeois as well as the social revolutionary newspapers demanded that the accusations against Lenin should be tried in court. At the same time, Alexander Parvus' name also appeared in the press. There were some Bolsheviks who thought Lenin could clear his name from these serious accusations before a court and therefore wanted to see him tried. Stalin and Ordzhonikidze were decidedly against this. The minister for war and naval affairs, Alexander Kerensky (1881- 1970), stepped forward on the 8th (21st) of July (he had just visited the front) and took over the post of prime minister to resolve this conflict with \"peaceful means\", as the phrase went. President Thomas Woodrow Wilson (a freemason) immediately began praising Kerensky as an eminent statesman and a worthy member of the Democratic Union of Honour. At the same time, Wilson blocked all attempts at peace negotiations with Germany. On the 9th (22nd) of July at 11 o'clock in the evening Lenin left Petrograd together with Zinoviev. He wanted to avoid the risk of being revealed as a German agent. Lenin had stayed in Maria Sulimova's flat and not with Sergei Alliluyev, as was officially claimed. Joseph Stalin and Sergei Alliluyev followed Lenin out of town. At first he stayed in Sestro- retsk and later in Razliv. One month later, he travelled to Jalkala (Finland) and finally ended up in Helsinki. The most remarkable and puzzling thing was that no one, despite the order of arrest, looked for Lenin. No one wanted to arrest him, despite the 209"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"fact that the Soviet propaganda later claimed the opposite. Alexander Parvus, meanwhile, began publishing spiteful attacks against Alexander Kerensky in the German press. He also sabotaged any possibility of peace. Lenin's, Zinoviev's and Kamenev's denials were repeated in Maxim Gorky's paper Novaya Zhizn on the 1 lth (24th) of July. On the 13th (26th) of July, the Petrograd Soviet demanded that Lenin and Zinoviev should be put on trial. Lenin continued to ignore those demands since he knew very well what might be revealed during a trial. The Bolshevik and freemason Nikolai Sukhanov (actually Gimmel) maintained, like many of his comrades, that Lenin was innocent and had nothing to fear from a possible trial. Lenin was afraid of such an investigation. In September 1991, the lawyers' union in St. Petersburg demanded that the accusations against Lenin should be investigated after the event. They wanted to put him on trial posthumously. Pavel Milyukov's bourgeois newspaper Rech (Speech) also accused Leon Trotsky of having received 10 000 dollars for propaganda. That was why Trotsky called July 1917 \"the month of the greatest libel in the history of the world\". The pressure of public opinion led to the arrest of Leon Trotsky and Anatoli Lunacharsky (actually Bailikh-Mandelstam) on August 5th. The authorities also arrested Alexandra Kollontay (1872-1952). Finally, even Mieczyslaw Kozlowski, Leon Kamenev and Yevgenia (Dora) Sumenson were arrested. This was only done to calm the public. All those people were accused of having contacts with Alexander Parvus who was regarded as an agent of the German Kaiser. The man in charge of the investigation, Alexandrov, collected plenty of material, filling a total of 24 volumes. They were kept in a special archive and made available to historians only after the fall of Communism. The authorities never got any further than this, despite having all the evidence they needed that the accused persons had collaborated with the enemy during wartime. This evidence would have been enough to execute all those involved. But the authorities took no further action. The 6th Bolshevik Congress began on the 26th of July (8th August). Some of the delegates (Joseph Stalin, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Nikolai Skrypnik, Nikolai Bukharin) were against Lenin and Zinoviev appearing voluntarily in court. V. Volodarsky was among those who wanted Lenin 210"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"put on trial. Lenin never forgot this and Volodarsky was assassinated on June 20th, 1918, less than a year later. Lenin decided to revenge himself upon Volodarsky immediately upon hearing that he had raked together much too big a fortune, which should have been the property of the Party leadership. Lenin had himself emphasised that the Bolsheviks must never forget anything. Kerensky began releasing arrested Bolsheviks as early as the 17th of August. Kamenev was the first to be set free. Kornilov's Revolt The Supreme Commander of the Russian army, General Lavr Kornilov (1870-1918), no longer wanted to take part in the shady game of the revolutionary freemasons. He broke away from them and began preparations in Mogilev to overthrow Kerensky's government. Kornilov understood that those left-wing ministers, who for many years had been shouting that they could do better than the Tsar's ministers were actually perfectly ignorant people. According to the prevailing myth, the February revolution was a very positive event. In reality, this coup d'etat led only to anarchy, as the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn emphasised in a BBC interview. On the 19th of August (1st September), Kornilov ordered his Cossacks to attack Petrograd. On the 25th of August (7th September) Kornilov said to his chief of staff: \"It is time to hang the Germans' supporters and spies led by Lenin. And we must destroy the Soviets so that they can never assemble again!\" On the same day he sent General Alexander Krymov's troops towards Petrograd with orders to hang all soviet members. (John Shelton Curtiss, \"The Russian Revolution of 1917\", New York, 1957, p. 50.) In his proclamation on August 26th (September 8th), (Novoye Vremya, 11th of September 1917), Kornilov accused the Provisional Government of co-operating with the Germans to undermine the state and army. He wanted to dissolve the Soviets and demanded that Kerensky should step down and give the power up to him. Kornilov understood that the Bolsheviks were the greatest danger to Russia. That was why he wanted them all imprisoned. 211"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Kerensky knew he had been exposed. His game was over. So he continued releasing imprisoned Bolsheviks. Kozlowski was also set free. He worked as a Chekist after the Bolsheviks' take-over of power. Kerensky was seized with panic and declared on the 27th of August (September 9th) that Komilov was a mutineer and officially deprived him of his command. Kerensky turned to the Bolsheviks for help against Komilov to salvage whatever he could. All the Bolsheviks were, as if by magic, immediately cleared of all charges and presented as the best possible defenders of democracy. Had not Trotsky said in the United States that power should be given to whoever was best able to develop democracy in Russia? The Bolsheviks, however, did everything they could to keep Kerensky in power. It was still too early for them to take over. The Bolsheviks had completely \"forgotten\" Lenin's slogan: \"No support for the Provisional Government!\" (\"The Shorter Biography of Lenin\", Moscow, 1955, p. 168.) The Bolsheviks began organising political strikes. They encouraged the workers and soldiers to defend the government. On the 27th of August the socialists founded a Central Committee against the counter-revolution to- gether with the Bolsheviks. They ordered thousands of sailors from Kron- stadt to Petrograd. The workers of Petrograd were forcibly mobilised. The Bolsheviks threatened to kill them if they did not obey. The Red Guards were immediately given back the weapons, which had been confiscated during the fierce July days. The Soviets began arresting people, primarily those who were suspected of sympathising with Komilov. Thousands of officers were arrested in this way. A total of 7000 politically \"suspect\" people were arrested. (John Shelton Curtiss, \"The Russian Revolution of 1917\", New York, 1957, p. 53.) The railwaymen were also mobilised and began sabotaging the railways. Thus Komilov's elite troops were halted and surrounded. International freemasonry suddenly began using enormous resources to halt Komilov, since the appearance of his revolt on the political scene had not been in the manuscript; he had to be removed by any means possible, including guile and violence. He was depicted as the worst thing that ever happened to Russia. Myths about him continue to be spread to this day. It is even claimed that he was ignorant of politics. The freemasons began a huge propaganda campaign among Komilov's soldiers who were thoroughly scared and confused. General Alexander 212"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Krymov (a freemason) was invited to negotiations with Kerensky. I do not know what they threatened Krymov with, but upon leaving this meeting he shot himself (if it was really he who held the weapon). The freemasons succeeded with their combined efforts in stopping Kor- nilov's national troops barely a week later, on the 30th of August (12th September). The left-wing leaders have always regarded right-wing national patriots as the biggest threat to their socialist world-view. Kornilov was arrested on the 1st (14th) of September but later managed to escape. The Bolsheviks immediately took the initiative in the Soviets. On the same day Kornilov was arrested, they gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet in the local elections. They became dominant in Moscow on the 8th (21st) of September. Trotsky was also released from prison on the 4th (17th) of September. Nobody wanted to remember anything about the July scandal any longer. Now the time was ripe to prepare a quiet, peaceful transfer of power. The 213 "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"suitable astrological time for the seizure of power had been calculated in advance. The Take-Over of Power To confuse and to camouflage their Illuminist order in Russia, the Bolshe- vik leadership intended to call the future regime the Soviet (i.e. Kahal) regime. On September 21st, 1917, Jakub Furstenberg sent a telegram from Stockholm to Raphael Scholan (Shaumann) in Haparanda (it is preserved in the American National Archives): \"Dear comrade! The office of the banking house M. Warburg has opened in accordance with telegram from president of Rhenish-Westphalian Syndicate an account for the under- taking of Comrade Trotsky. The attorney (agent), presumably Mr. Kastroff, purchased arms and has organised their transportation... And a person authorised to receive the money demanded by Comrade Trotsky. Fiirstenberg.\" On the 23rd September (6th of October) Trotsky was elected chairman of the Petrograd Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet, despite his being neither a soldier nor a worker. Everything was possible among the freemasons. Meanwhile, the United States demanded ever larger contributions to the war from Kerensky. The Provisional Government reluctantly complied. The minister for war affairs, Alexander Verkhovsky, resigned in protest. It is interesting to note that the American demands ceased immediately after the Bolsheviks had seized power. I must point out here that, according to Antony Sutton, different docu- ments in the archives of the American State Department prove that David Francis, the American ambassador in Moscow, was kept well-informed about the Bolsheviks' plans. The White House knew at least six weeks in advance when the Bolsheviks would ta ke over power. That event had been appointed to take place on a date, which happened to coincide with Trotsky's birthday. So, those plans were known in the United States as early as the 13th (26th) September 1917. The president of the United States Thomas Woodrow Wilson knew in advance that the Bolshevik take-over would prolong the world war. But he did nothing to stop their plans. On the contrary, he did everything in his 214"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"power to aid them. The United States of America was the only nation to make a huge profit on the war. All the other warring powers lost gigantic sums and came to owe the United States a total of 14 billion dollars. It has been calculated that the international financial elite made a total of 208 billion dollars on the war. The British government also knew about the Bolshevik plans, since they also recommended that their subjects leave Moscow at least six weeks before the take-over. (Antony C. Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 45.) So it appears both London and Washington knew whom they were dealing with. The 8th of November came ever closer and the Bolsheviks did every- thing in their power to spread apathy among the workers and soldiers, which they later intended to exploit. They also tried to tempt people with the magic word: \"Peace!\", which no longer felt so treasonable. The Bolshevik Party was not very large at this point. Furthermore, it had an Illuminist core of 4000 members who were most active. Meanwhile, the circulation of Pravda decreased from 220 000 to 85 000 copies. According to Margarita Fofanova, Lenin returned to Petrograd on the 5th and not the 20th of October, as officially claimed. He stayed with Fofanova until the take-over. The authorities knew perfectly well that Lenin was in Petrograd. Lenin's sister Maria confirmed this to an official. The Provisional Government did not in any way try to pursue or arrest Lenin. The Bolshevik plans to seize power were no secret. The general public was not ignorant about them and least of all the Provisional Government. Zinoviev and Kamenev wrote quite openly of their plans in the newspaper Novaya Zhizn on the 31st of October. Lenin had also spoken publicly of those plans on a number of occasions. The historian E. M. Halliday ad- mitted in his book \"Russia in Revolution\" (Malmo, 1968, p. 114) that the authorities knew of the Bolshevik plans in detail. So why, unless they were involved in the conspiracy, did they do nothing about it? For several historians, however, the mystery was not so much the fact that the Bolsheviks had officially discussed their take-over plans in the press, but that the Provisional Government took no steps to protect itself; in fact it did quite the opposite. Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky refused to order special troops to Petrograd, when this was suggested. 215"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"(Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 37.) It is of course a fabrication that the leading Bolsheviks gathered on the 23rd of October (5th of November) in Nikolai Sukhanov's (Gimmel's) flat and only then decided to organise the assault on the Winter Palace. Any other Bolshevik leaders but Lenin and Trotsky would have said that armed action was completely unnecessary, since they would gain power at the Second Soviet Congress on the 25th October (7th of November) anyway. This seems to have been a later invention since Trotsky had already formed a military revolutionary committee on the 12th (25th) of October. The power was transferred to this organ in secret on the 21 st of October (3rd of November). (Heller and Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 38.) All the available facts today suggest an organised plot and not any kind of spontaneous action. Lenin was not seen between the 2nd and 7th of November. He was not needed. It was Trotsky who organised everything. Lenin disappeared from Fofanova's flat in the late evenings. Only Stalin knew anything about Lenin's mysterious disappearances. Lenin was not at Fofanova's on the evening of the 24th of October (6th of November). Neither was he in the Soviet building in the Smolny palace. This was confirmed in the book \"About Nadezhda Krupskaya\", published in 1988 in Moscow. Nadezhda had come from Smolny to Fofanova's flat to look for Lenin. But he was not there. The historians Heller and Nekrich came to the same conclusion: Lenin was not even in Smolny in the late evening of the 6th of November. According to other sources, he turned up only on the 7th of November. He had taken a tram to Smolny. Lenin said to Trotsky in German: \"Es schwin- delt!\" (I'm dizzy!). He was in control! Lenin immediately began threatening with executions if he was not completely obeyed. But it was still Trotsky who led the show. The Soviet Congress, which had taken up residence in the Smolny Girls' School, was led by Fiodor Dan (actually Gurvich, 1871-1947), one of the Menshevik leaders. The conspirators announced already at 10:40 in the morning of the 7th of November that the Provisional Government had been overthrown and the power seized by the Soviets. The Soviet Congress accepted the motion to form a new government - the Council of People's Commissaries (Sovnarkom). The suggestion received 390 votes out of 650. The government was to be exclusively composed of Bolsheviks with 216"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Lenin at the head. The leader of the Mensheviks, L. Martov, left the congress together with the other members of his party. It was actually the military revolutionary committee who had seized the power. The Bolsheviks modelled it on the revolutionary committees the Jacobins created during the so-called French Revolution. The committee in Petrograd consisted of 18 Commissars. Most of them were either Jews or married to Jewesses. The chairman was Leon Trotsky (Jew). Other members were: Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin (half-Jew), Adolf Yoffe (Jew), Josef Unschlicht (Jew), Gleb Boky (Jew), Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko (Jew), Konstantin Mekhonoshin (Jew), Mikhail Lashevich (Jew), Felix Dzerzhinsky (Rufin, Jew), P. Lazimir (Jew), A. Sadovsky (Jew), Pavel Dybenko (married to the Jewess Alexandra Kollontay), Nikolai Pod- voisky, Vyacheslav Molotov (actually Skryabin), Vladimir Nevsky (Feodosi Krivobokov), Andrei Bubnov and Nikolai Skrypnik (Jew). Lenin and his government gained power temporarily. That was why he also called his government provisional until the Constituent Assembly was elected on the 17th of November. Something inexplicable happened at this point: in fact - nothing at all happened on the afternoon of the 7th of November. The historians cannot understand why the Winter Palace was not taken at once. The Soviet Congress also paused a while. Trotsky went into another room to rest. It was officially claimed that Lenin was in the building too, and went to sleep in another room in the afternoon. At this time Lenin seemed to be but Trotsky's bloodhound. At the Soviet Congress, only Trotsky was seen as he now and then came out to speak with some members. Lenin was nowhere to be seen. He only sent a few notes to Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Nikolai Podvoisky and some of the others at the congress. (Sergei Melgunov, \"How the Bolsheviks Seized Power\", Paris, 1953.) According to the myth, about 5000 sailors had already gathered around the Winter Palace to prepare the storming early in the morning of the 25th October (7th of November). In actual fact, this building was taken over by a few hundred \"revolutionaries\", including 50 Red Guards, who calmly just marched straight into the palace. What happened to all of those tens of thousands of \"revolutionary soldiers\" who are so warmly spoken of in the history books? This was just 217"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"another fabrication, for the Winter Palace was never stormed. It was not necessary. But to take over the seat of power at a carefully calculated point in time was a symbolic act wi th astrological connotations for Lenin and Trotsky. That was why Trotsky still wanted to gather as many people as possible. 235 workers were brought from the Baltic Dockyard. Only 80 were fetched from the Putilov Factory, despite 1500 Red Guards having been officially registered there. A total of 26 000 worked there. All the impor- tant sites in the city were taken over by a few thousand \"revo- lutionaries\"... The first Red Guards gathered by the Winter Palace only at around 4:30 in the afternoon, according to the exiled Russian historian Sergei Melgu- nov. The chief of the Red Guards, Vladimir Nevsky (who later became people's commissary for communications), received orders to wait. At around six o'clock, the principal of the Artillery Academy in Mikhailovsk ordered his cadets to leave the Winter Palace. The Cossacks also left. (Sergei Melgunov, \"How the Bolsheviks Seized Power\", Paris, 1953, p. 119.) Eventually only two companies of the women's battalion and 40 disabled soldiers remained. This cannot be explained in any other way than that the Provisional Government did everything in its power to hand the Winter Palace over to the Bols heviks as peacefully as possible. The Provisional Government no longer held any power. It was all just a big show for the public. The theatres held their performances, the restaurants stayed open. Nobody noticed that anything strange was going on. The bridge watchmen had no idea about the real situation, either. Lenin and Trotsky, wishing to be on the safe side by securing all the transport routes between the different areas of the city, had bribed all the bridge watchmen. Time passed and still nothing happened. Everybody waited. According to the myth, the Bolsheviks had issued an ultimatum to the Provisional Government, which refused to answer. But how could they issue an ulti- matum to a government, which already on the 3rd of November had voluntarily handed over power to the military revolutionary committee? Besides, Trotsky had confirmed at 2:35 in the afternoon of the 7th of November that the Provisional Government no longer existed. At 10 o'clock the Soviet Congress had proclaimed: \"Government power lies with the Military Revolutionary Committee!\" 218"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Why it was necessary for Trotsky to put up a show will soon be evident to the observant reader. Trotsky w anted the whole spectacle to appear more dramatic than it actually was. For this reason, he had a number of shells fired from the Peter-Paul Fort while trams continued to roll over the Troitsky Bridge, according to the British ambassador Sir George Bucha- nan (who, by the way, was involved in the deposition of the Tsar). The remarkable thing was that those shells never hit the Winter Palace. The official explanation was that they were aimed too badly. But why could the Bolsheviks not find anyone among all those thousands of \"revolutionary soldiers\" who could aim properly? It appears that those who fired the shells suddenly lost their ability to aim straight. All those explosions only managed to break one single window. Why were precisely 35 shells fired? Did that number have some Cabbalistic meaning? The Red Guards waited for a while outside the Winter Palace despite the absence of guards at the side-door, according to Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich (\"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 41). Neither did the Petrograd Garrison take any action against the Bolsheviks. They just watched the show. The Red Guards walked around in the city and coerced a few sailors into following them to the Winter Palace, including Indrikis Ruckulis, who was a 27-year-old Latvian officer from Kronstadt and the commander of a group of sailors. He was threatened with death when he refused to accompany the Red Guards. He asserted that no single shell was fired from the armoured cruiser Aurora to give the signal for the storming, as was later claimed. (Expressen, the 17th of October 1984.) This was another myth. There was no storming of the Winter Palace. Everything proceeded calmly. No blood was spilled. The Red Guards just waited until it was time to march in. They waited until 1:30 in the morning, according to Indrikis Ruckulis and several other sources. They opened fire for fifteen minutes for the sake of appearances. Nobody was hurt during this \"battle\", according to a young Marxist, Uralov, who was there. There was nobody to hurt. The Bolsheviks' fire was never answered. The Red Guards and sailors then walked through side doors into the Winter Palace, according to the historians Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, who had found testimonies relating this. The remaining members 219"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"of the women's battalion made no resistance, but \"capitulated im- mediately\". When the Bolsheviks had coolly walked in through the unguarded entrances, they strolled about in the halls and corridors and greeted the \"defenders\", who did not resist, in a friendly manner (E. M. Halliday, \"Russia in Revolution\", Malmo, 1968, p. 120). Even E. M. Halliday confirms that there was never a battle. Only in Moscow was any kind of resistance offered. The Kremlin was fired upon until three in the morning, despite the fact that the cadets had left the building by 7 o'clock on the previous evening. Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko (1883-1937), who was a comrade of Trotsky, had been given the task of removing the Provisional Government. Here something extremely puzzling occurred. Radio Russia related this on the 12th of August 1991 at two in the afternoon. Antonov-Ovseyenko and his Red Guards reached the Malachite Hall just before two o'clock and waited behind a door leading to the council chamber of the Provisional Government. The government (without Kerensky) had, against all reason, gathered there. Why? Antonov-Ovseyenko just stood looking at the clock. Red Guards and sailors also stood waiting for Antonov-Ovseyenko's signal. They waited there for about ten minutes. He later sent a telegram to Lenin: \"The Winter Palace was taken over at 2:04.\" At 2:10 Antonov-Ovseyenko said: \"It is time!\" (\"Para!\") to the Red Guards. He opened the door and said something very cryptic: \"Gentlemen! Your time is up!\" We may presume that the Bolsheviks officially took over on the 26th October (8th of November) 1917 at 2:04 in the morning. A closer astrological investigation reveals that the sun was just then in the precise centre of the sign of Scorpio (14°58'). In the horoscope of the Soviet regime, MC (Medium Coeli = the zenith) lay 4°28' in Gemini (which stands for power) - an aspect which was favourable to the seizure of power. This horoscope was the worst possible for the subjects of the Soviet Union. It shows that everything was based upon deceit. Only technical development was favoured, spiritual values were entirely rejected. Only the terrorist power-mongers were at an advantage. According to its horoscope, the Soviet regime brought nothing good at all into the world. People should have been wary of such a deadly 220"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"power. It brought only enormous problems and catastrophes. The Swedish astrologer Anders Ekstrom in Skyttorp confirms this interpretation.

Their most important astrologer was the Jewish Bolshevik Lev Karakhan (Karakhanyan), later vice people's commissary for foreign affairs. To later exclude others from similar research, the Bolsheviks immediately declared that astrology was mere bourgeois nonsense and superstition. A very clever move. Russian and Polish Jews also founded the state of Israel. If we investigate Israel's horoscope, we see that the most suitable time had also been calculated there. The result was the best possible. In this way, they favoured their own at 4:37 in the afternoon of the 14th of May 1948... The fact that Antonov-Ovseyenko waited until 2:10 favoured only the new regime. 2:10, when the members of the Provisional Government were taken away, was presumably a key time. (Nicholas Campion, \"The Book of World Horoscopes\", Wellingborough, 1988, p. 280.) Lenin also claimed this. Trotsky had his 38th birthday on the 26th October (8th of November) 1917, and the whole spectacle became his birthday party as well as the beginning of a new epoch. (The phases of the moon are repeated every 19th year.) Scorpio is the eighth sign of the zodiac - the sign of crime and death. Certain days had a special significance for the Bolshevik leadership. Why else conceal Lenin's true date of birth? I should like to point out here that the Soviet army did everything in its power to take Berlin on May 1st, 1945 so that the red flag of the Illuminati could be hoisted over the city on that very day. It is obvious that the official time (8th of November) was extremely important to the conspirators. Had not Kerensky already relinquished power to the Bolshevik elite, without the public at large hearing anything about it, on the 3rd of November (21st of October)? To mislead their subjects, the Bolsheviks began officially celebrating the revolution on November 7th. That elite who actually became a secret red transitional government were responsible for the show. Those ten men, of whom at least half were secret freemasons, made up the Politburo and the Military Revolutionary Committee, which had been founded on the 16th (29th) of October - Yahweh's doomsday. They were: Vladimir Lenin (half-Jew), Leon Trotsky (Jew), Grigori Zinoviev (Jew), Leon Kamenev (Jew), Grigori Sokolnikov (Jew), Yakov 222"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Sverdlov (Jew), Joseph Stalin (half-Jew), Felix Dzerzhinsky (Jew), Moisei Uritsky (Jew) and Andrei Bubnov (Russian). Was this spectacle then a Russian revolution? Not one single historian has been able to explain logically why the Bolsheviks waited on the evening of the 7th of November and did not take the Winter Palace at once. The only reason that any historian has come up with is that the Bolshevik leadership lacked resolution on that evening. The reader may decide whether to accept this explanation or not. The next question is: why did the Provisional Government give up voluntarily and so easily? Trotsky tried to explain this by saying that the Provisional Government wanted to avoid bloodshed. Trotsky was hardly a reliable man. He simply wanted to conceal that the Masonic brothers had made up certain deals among themselves. I must mention here that there was a mysterious figure who represented the Bolshevik freemasons but took part in the meeting of the Provisional Government. His name was Yuri Steklov (actually Nakhamkis) and was the agent of the Bolshevik Central Committee. His behaviour made it seem as if it was he who decided how long the Provisional Government was allowed to act and remain in power. It was as if he alone acknowledged and allowed the very existence of the Provisional Government. He acted as if he were in charge of seeing that the government did not overstep its authority and mandate. (Vladimir Nabokov, \"The Provisional Government and the Bolshevik Coup\", London, 1988, p. 116.) Yuri Steklov was a freemason of the 32nd degree and Kerensky's son-in-law. The ungrateful Lenin showed appreciation only to his Masonic masters in Paris, who had helped him into power. In 1919, he sent enormous amounts of money to the Masonic order Grand Orient de France, to be used for the renovation of their palatial headquarters in Paris, propaganda and other purposes. Meanwhile, millions of Russians were starving to death. (Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: The History of the Russian People in the Twentieth Century\", Moscow, 1997, p. 557.) It became Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko's task to tell the Provisional Government that their time was up. The mob who, somewhat later than the Red Guards, entered the Winter Palace, began plundering and destroying the furniture. The eyes of the portraits were cut out, valuable books and icons were thrown on the floor and trampled on. They also began to rape women. 223"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"According to yet another myth in the huge Bolshevik repertoire, all the ministers (except Kerensky) were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, but there are names among them who later turned up in the Bolshevik administration. For instance, the freemason and former minister of communications, Nikolai Nekrasov, became a bureaucrat in the Co- operative Central Union in 1920. (Professor N. Pervushin's article \"The Russian Freemasons and the Revolution\" in the newspaper Novoye Russkoye Slovo, New York, August 1, 1986, p. 6.) Even the Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia (Vol. 56, Moscow, 1936, p. 301) confirmed that Kerensky's minister of the interior, Sergei Urusov, later worked in the Soviet National Bank. He was still the emissary of the French freemasons. The world is truly puzzling and the official history contains so many incredible fairy tales for adults that \"A Thousand and One Nights\" pales in comparison. According to the official Bolshevik version, Kerensky managed to escape to Gachino near Petrograd wearing a woman's clothing, whereupon he went on to Pskov. Nothing more. Kerensky claimed in his memoirs that he put on a sailor's uniform and escaped to Gachino where he wanted to organise a resistance but failed, since the troops went away (!?). The historians Nesta Webster and Kurt Kerlen, however, have found some revealing information, which they published in their book \"Boche and Bolshevik\" (New York, 1923, p. 19). According to this version, Lenin and Trotsky let Kerensky \"disappear\" in recognition of his contributions when he protected them from the public in July 1917. It was also Kerensky who saw that the railway tickets for Lenin's and his group's journey from Stockholm to Petrograd was paid for. And finally, he left the power in their hands. According to the myth, Kerensky was opposed to the Communists. He was actually the Grand Secretary of the Grand Orient in Russia. Lenin and Trotsky supplied him with false documents and a large amount of money and had him escorted to Murmansk, which had been occupied by the British. Kerensky was received as a \"White\" refugee in Murmansk. He boarded an Italian steamboat and sailed to England, according to documents, which have been preserved in London. Kerensky later lived in Berlin, Paris and California as a wealthy man. He died in New York on the 12th of June 1970. 224"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Even the great falsifier of history E. M. Halliday admitted in his book \"Russia in Revolution\" (Malmo, 1968, p. 117) that Kerensky left the Winter Palace and Petrograd on the morning of November 7th in an automobile, which was placed at his disposal by the American Embassy. The car carried an American flag. So now we know how he got to Murmansk and from there to England. This must have been planned well before the Bolshevik take-over. He had time enough for this but not enough to call on special troops to defend Petrograd. Was this not most peculiar? All this forces an independently thinking person to wonder whether the Provisional Government did not actually prepare for the coming terror of the Bolsheviks. Why else did the United States of America and Great Britain order their people to leave Russia in good time before the transfer of power? The Bolsheviks were then officially just as democratic as Kerensky and his lackeys. What happened in February (March) 1917 was not a revolution, but a coup d'etat organised from without. The Bolsheviks themselves, however, did not carry out a coup d'etat in October (November) 1917, as we have learned in the West, but simply took over power. It was an internationally controlled conspiracy. If this was not the case, then a great number of important facts cannot be explained; instead, everything becomes dim and incomprehensible. If we assume that it really was a planned conspiracy, then all those strange events, which I described earlier, immediately have a clear explanation. The Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia maintained that the very fact that Marxism was introduced in Russia proves that it is a true ideology. No other evidence was necessary. Lenin said after the take-over: \"We shall now build the socialist order.\" Trotsky corrected him: \"We must establish a socialist dictatorship.\" The Jewish author Alexander Zinoviev said in an interview in the spring of 1984 that \"the Soviet regime is eternal, the Soviet society cannot be destroyed even in a thousand years\". He stressed to the interviewer, George Urban: \"The Soviet system will remain until the end of human history.\" Not even Trotsky and Lenin could believe that. The astrologer E. H. Troinsky calculated in 1956 that the Soviet state would begin falling apart after 72 years and 7 months, i.e., after July 1990. As we all know, the Soviet regime was seriously weakened precisely after 225"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"June 1990 and finally fell in August 1991. The Soviet Union was officially dissolved four months later. The German Aid The Masonic Bolsheviks wanted to be certain that they could stay in power. That was why they asked the Germans for help. German troops were sent to throw an iron ring around Petrograd so that no oppositional forces, including General Piotr Krasnov's Cossacks, could threaten the Bolshevik government (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 24). It was also the Germans who put down a revolt among the cadets at an army training school in Petrograd, captured the Kremlin for the Bolsheviks in Moscow, fought back Krasnov's Cossacks and per- formed other similar actions vital to the survival of the Reds. General Kir- bach promised that Moscow and Petrograd would be occupied by German troops if the Bolshevik government was threatened. The weak Soviet regime was protected by up to 280 000 disciplined German soldiers. Part of those German troops was called the international battalions in the beginning, but in the Soviet history books they were known as \"Latvian riflemen\". There were just 20 Latvians among these \"Inter- nationalists\", according to the historian Igor Bunich (\"The Party's Gold\", p. 79). In the autumn of 1918 there were 50 000 men in this international army. That number had increased to 250 000 in the summer of 1920 (M. Heller and A. Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 95). There were also a considerable number of Chinese soldiers and Polish Jews in those troops. The latter usually played a leading role. Colonel Heinrich von Ruppert had travelled with a Swedish passport to Petrograd as early as April 1917 to give secret instructions to the German prisoners of war, who later helped the Bolsheviks in every way imaginable, according to Igor Bunich. A highly interesting American report, which reached Washington on the 9th of December 1917, stated, among other things, that General William V. Judson saw many Germans w hen he visited Trotsky in Smolny. (Antony C. Sutton, \"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\", Morley, 1981, p. 45.)

The Germans got their longed-for separate peace with Russia on the 3rd of March 1918, though Lenin had proclaimed his decree of peace immediately on the 7th of November 1917. A parade of the \"internationalists\", that is, the Germans, for Lenin and his Bolshevik government was organised for the 29th of October (11th of November) 1917. The Germans had received instructions to shout: \"We greet you, World Revolution!\" But instead they shouted: \"We greet you, Kaiser Wilhelm!\" Lenin took this as an insult.

The American president Thomas Woodrow Wilson also gave orders not to intervene against the Bolshevik revolution, according to Antony Sutton. But just in case things still went wrong, the leading Bolsheviks had been given foreign passports so that they could flee abroad just as unexpectedly as they had turned up. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 8.) Nikolai Bukharin (actually Dolgolevsky) had made plans to escape to Argentina. Lenin calmed his fellow criminals: \"We have always been lucky and so it shall remain!\" So, these were actually Jewish criminal groups who had come to power in order to suck the life from the body of the victim. Other Jews were immediately given privileged positions. This is actually confirmed by the rabbi Elmer Berger in his book \"The Jewish Dilemma\", published in the United States in 1946. Berger wrote that the Soviet government privileged the Jews for being Jews, not just through the fact that Jews dominated the Soviet regime. By a single stroke of the pen, every suggestion of anti-Semitism became punishable with death. The Beginning of the Government Terror The Jewish gangster groups who called themselves Bolsheviks became particularly dangerous, since the theory behind their activities attempted to justify the crimes they committed (in the name of the workers) and to practise deceit and sabotage against the spiritual culture. Lenin was well aware that the Bolsheviks needed all the help they could get to acquire Russia's wealth. That was why he said that they must make 227"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"use of common criminals as allies with Communism. (Louis Fischer, \"The Life of Lenin\", London, 1970.) The criminals took Lenin's slogan \"Plunder what was plundered!\" seriously and managed to find a large amount of well-hidden valuables. The Bolsheviks then captured them, confiscated their loot and murdered those rivals on the spot. The criminals probably realised soon enough that the Bolsheviks intended to monopolise crime, like they did the truth. In this way gang after gang of bandits were liquidated. As I have mentioned previously, the Bolshevik speculators around Lenin found it hard to believe that all their plans would actually succeed, so they immediately began to plunder Russia of its wealth. All those riches were quickly sent abroad, primarily to Berlin. The international bankers were very happy about this turn of events, according to Igor Bunich. The Bolsheviks acted with such haste and violence that it seems they thought the plundering and murdering might have to cease on the very next day. By the aid of \"contracts of sale\" written under threat, many estates and houses were handed over to Jewish \"businessmen\" living outside Russia. The Bolshevik leaders immediately took over stately homes to live in. Lenin became the \"owner\" of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrov's estate in Gorky near Moscow. All the villagers were forced to leave their homes to make room for Lenin's bodyguards. Trotsky got hold of Prince Felix Yusupov's castle. The Bolsheviks were especially interested in items of gold. The leading Chekists, for example, used only golden plates for their meals. The Bolshevik leader had, immediately after the take-over, given orders to draw up lists of people who absolutely had to be executed. Lenin declared that an entire social class (the bourgeoisie) would have to be eliminated. The chief revolutionary believed that the children absolutely had to watch while their parents were murdered. It was the Bolsheviks who decided who was bourgeois. In that way many ordinary, simple people were also murdered. Talented intellectuals quickly perceived the true nature of this crime syndicate, which called itself the Bolsheviks-Communists. The intel- lectuals' name for this extravaganza of murder and robbery was Jewish Bolshevism. They looked on with alarm as the wealth was snatched from the hands of the Russians. Lenin and his fellow criminals wanted to rid 228"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"themselves of these clear-sighted intellectuals as quickly as possible. Only the spiritually blind or those blinded by envy were allowed to live. This giant robbery was transformed into a kind of malformed business. The New York Herald Tribune wrote: \"It seems as if the Bolshevik revo- lution in Russia is actually an enormous financial operation, the goal of which is to transfer the control of vast sums of money from the Russians to European and American banks.\" At the beginning of April 1919, George Pitter-Wilson confirmed in the Globe (London): \"The aim of Bolshevism is to gain complete power in the non-Jewish areas, so that no wealth remains in non-Jewish hands. In this way, the Jews would be able to gain power over everyone, ostensibly in the interest of others.\" Meanwhile, they began spreading the most famous myth, according to which the Jews had nothing to do with the so-called Russian revolution. It was not in their interest to allow the truth to come out. For this very reason Lenin said: \"The revolution needs no historians!\" The Bolsheviks have to be regarded as the worst mythomaniacs the world has ever seen, since they and their henchmen immediately began spreading the lie that these events were solely the holy action of the Russian people. Unfortunately, most historians took service with untruth. They believed it necessary to adapt to the situation. The Bolsheviks began confiscating as much private property as they could. They also prohibited private commerce. The subjects were regarded as the property of the state (i.e. the Jewish Bolshevik leadership). The following lines could still be read in Nordisk Familjebok (a Swedish encyclopaedia) in 1944 (reprint of the 3rd edition, Vol. 10, col. 1228): \"The strong Jewish element in the leadership of the Russian Bolshevik regime stirred up resentment in many places in Russia and led to the spreading of the belief that Bolshevism was predominantly a Jewish movement.\" Communism was simultaneously used as camouflage for international criminal activity. That was why Co mmunism became a modern form of a collective slave-state. The Communist Party later became a real Mafia and its general secretary was just like the Capo di tutti i capi (the boss of all bosses). The Russian people faced a dreadful time of violent clashes and complete degradation. The Red Jews' aim was to subdue the Russians as 229"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"quickly as possible and later expand their power into other countries. In the beginning these criminals managed, with the help of German troops and American financial support, to eliminate or force into exile nearly all the honest and independently thinking people in Russia and transform the nation into a criminal society. There were also German and other foreign elite soldiers among the Chekist Special Forces, according to Igor Bunich. A total of 280 000 so- called internationalists protected the Bolshevik regime. The Germans declared that they would immediately send troops if any threat to the Soviet regime appeared. Lenin's bodyguards were also primarily Ger- mans; among them was Friedrich von Platten from Switzerland. The Germans also continued to give the Bolsheviks financial aid. In November 1917 they received 11.5 million marks, a sum which was the equivalent of 130 million dollars in 1975. Lenin was forced to keep his promise. On December 15th he made separate peace with Germany. After the signing of the peace agreement in Brest-Litovsk on the 3rd of March 1918, he received 40 million roubles in gold to fight against the Whites. On the 20th of August 1918, Lenin, in return, wrote an open letter to the American workers and asked them not to fight against Germany. 93.5 tons of gold (245.5 tons, according to Oleg Platonov, \"Russia's Crown of Thorns: the History of the Russian People in the Twentieth Century\", Moscow, 1997, p. 528) were to be transferred to Germany in connection with the Brest-Litovsk peace agreement. This \"affair\" was also concealed from the people. The rabbi Judas Magnus from the American Jews' committee in New York, admitted on the 24th of October 1918 that he also was a Bolshevik and liked the ideas of the new regime in Russia. The leading Zionist newspapers Jewish Chronicle (London) and American Hebrew (New York) praised the Bolshevik regime in Russia as a triumph for the Jewish model of society in their editorials from December 1918 up to Lenin's death in 1924. It was certainly a triumph. In fact, the world had never before seen such a triumph of evil and violence. American Hebrew wrote on September 8, 1920: \"The Bolshevik Revo- lution was largely the product of Jewish thinking, Jewish discontent, Jewish effort to reconstruct.\" American Hebrew wrote on September 10, 1920: \"What Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent have so powerfully 230"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"contributed to produce in Russia, the same historic qualities of the Jewish mind are tending to promote in other countries.\" On the 23rd of July 1919, Scotland Yard wrote a report to the American secretary of state, wherein it is written, among other things, that they now had enough evidence to prove that Bolshevism was an international movement controlled by Jews. Another report to the American secretary of state in 1918 stated that the leadership of each city-soviet was comprised of at least 50 per cent Jews, especially malign Jews \"of the worst type\", many of whom were anarchists. (\"U.S. State Department Report, Foreign Relations 1918, Russia\", Vol. 11, p. 240.) Professor Israel Shahak put it bluntly: \"An examination of radical, socialist and communist parties can provide many examples of disguised Jewish chauvinists and racists, who joined these parties merely for reasons of 'Jewish interest' and are, in Israel, in favour of 'anti-Gentile' discrimi- nation.\" (Israel Shahak, \"Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years\", London, 1994, p. 17.) The French Jewish newspaper Le Droit de Vivre wrote on May 13, 1933: \"Judaism is the father of Marxism and Communism.\" To neutralise the threat of the anti-Communists in other countries, the Jewish Voice (U.S.A.) launched the following slogan in July 1941 (p. 23): \"Anti- Communism is anti-Semitism!\" The infamous American Zionist organi- sation, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has been of the same opinion since the beginning (Executive Intelligence Review, No. 39, 30th September 1988). This organisation has very close connections with B'nai B'rith. Did not the Bolshevik, M. Kogan, coolly state in his article \"Services of Jewry to the Working Class\": \"Without exaggeration, it may be said that the Great Socialist October Revolution was indeed accomplished by the hands of the Jews... The symbol of Jewry, which for centuries has struggled against capitalism, has become also the symbol of the Russian proletariat, which can be seen even in the fact of the adoption of the Red five-pointed star, which in former times, as is well-known, was the symbol of Zionism and Jewry.\" {Kommunist, Kharkov, 12th April 1919.) This is confirmed in a leaflet written by the famous author Maxim Gorky, which praised the enormous contributions of the Jews to the introduction of socialism. This leaflet worried Trotsky and Lenin. They 231"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"thought it was formulated in such an unfortunate way that they feared enemies of the revolution (i.e. anti-Semites) would be able to use the information contained therein - so the leaflet was forbidden. Maxim Gorky had not always been so friendly towards the Jews, however. Just after the unsuccessful coup attempts in 1905, he published a violently anti-Semitic leaflet in which he exhorted: \"Arise, Russian people, against the Jews!\" Later, when he had become the willing tool of the Jewish \"revolutionaries\", he wanted to forget all about his earlier leaflet. The Bolsheviks concealed as much as they could about themselves. All kinds of truths immediately became state secrets. Lenin was the master of all liars. Who were those robbers and bandits who believed violence to be the best way of controlling a society? The Bolsheviks' primary and most important controlling organ after the take-over became the Politburo, which consisted of the following seven people: Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Leon Kamenev, Grigori Sokolnik ov (Brilliant), Grigori Zinoviev, Joseph Stalin and Andrei Bubnov. Only the last of those named was a Russian. Those men, together with the Party Central, decided at 2:30 A.M. on November 9th to form a one-party government (Sovnarkom), ignoring the other parties. Lenin named himself head of government. He wanted to make Trotsky his second in command - People's Commissary for Internal Affairs. He would thereby also hav e become vice-chairman of Sovnarkom. Lenin wanted Trotsky to crush the \"bourgeoisie\" and the aristocracy. Trotsky declined and afterwards explained: \"I said [to Lenin] that it was unnecessary, in my opinion, to play into the enemy's hands... it would be much better if there were no Jews at all in the first Soviet revolutionary government.\" A Soviet historian, Viktor Danilov, published this infor- mation in the newspaper History Workshop Journal in 1990. (Svenska Dagbladet, 12th April 1990.) That was why an alcoholic Russian, Alexei Rykov (1881-1938) was named people's commissary for internal affairs. Leon Trotsky was made responsible for foreign affairs instead. So, Trotsky and other Jews in the Politburo wanted as few Jews as possible to be visible in the Bolshevik government. The answer was to employ a number of Russian puppets: V. Nogin (1878-1924) who was responsible for trade and industry; the freemason Ivan Skvortsov- 232"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Stepanov, who became people's commissary for financial affairs; Nikolai Avilov (Glebov), communications; Vladi mir Milyutin, agriculture; and the Ukrainian Pavel Dybenko (1889-1938) who became people's commissary for naval affairs. The half-Jew Joseph Stalin was also allowed to take responsibility for questions of nationality, an artificial office. He was hardly ever seen at the People's Commissariat. The other members of the first Soviet government were Jews, however: the freemason Anatoli Lunacharsky (actually Bailikh-Mandelstam), who became people's commissary for educational affairs; the freemason Niko- lai Krylenko (Aaron Bram, 1885-1938), who became People's Com- missary for Military Affairs; Ivan Teodorovich, who became commissary for foodstuffs; Georgi Lomov (actua lly Oppokov), who was responsible for justice; Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko (1883-1939) and finally Alex- ander Shlyapnikov (actually Belenin), who was responsible for employ- ment. So, there were 15 members in the very first Soviet government, according to the Worker and Peasant Government's Newspaper, No. 1, 10th of November 1917. It soon became evident that the Russians in the Bolshevik government were unable to introduce the gangster regime of which the Jewish freemasons dreamed, despite the fact that all those puppet-Russians were surrounded in their offices by Jewish aides who, according to several protocols, eagerly took part in government meetings. I shall mention a few of those advisers here: Fanigstein-Daletsky, Abram Slutsky and Altfater. So Lenin subsequently exchanged the Russians for Jewish Bolsheviks and also introduced new commissary posts. The alcoholic Rykov's post was given to Grigori Petrovsky (1878-1958) just 20 days later. Georgi Lomov had to leave his post as commissary for justice. This post was instead given to the Jew Josef (Isidor) Steinberg. Vladimir Milyutin was exchanged for the Jew Alexander Schlichter (1868-1940). Nikolai Avilov (1868-1940) had to make way for the Jew Vyacheslav Zof. There were also two new members: the Jew V. Volodarsky (actually Moisei Goldstein) became people's commissary for propaganda and press and the Jewess Alexandra Kollontay was named people's commissary for social affairs. There were a total of 17 government members, of whom 11 were Jews, two half-Jews and only four were Slavs (three Russians and one Ukrainian). The Jewish members subsequently became more visible. 233"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The first chairman of the Central Executive Committee was the freemason Leon Kamenev (Leiba Rosenfeld), in the West flatteringly termed \"president\". His assumed name Kamenev means \"stony\". He was married to Trotsky's youngest sister, Olga. Kamenev held this high post for only 13 days before he was replaced by another Jewish freemason, Yakov Sverdlov (Yankel-Aaron Movshevich Solomon). Kamenev instead became the mayor of Moscow. He was also the vice-chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for a while. He was named People's Commissary for Commerce in 1926. He was executed on the 25th of August 1936. The Bolsheviks opened a Pandora's box, drowned Russia, and later inundated many other countries in terrible sufferings. They introduced a feudal banditregime they called Bolshevism. Only hope and fear remained. Streets, squares and even cities were eventually named after the Jews in power: Volodarsky, Slutsk, Sverdlovsk... The Social Revolutionaries protested strongly against Lenin's actions. To keep up appearances, Lenin offered the left wing of the Social Revo- lutionaries four posts in the Sovnarkom. In the beginning they declined the offer, but somewhat later the Social Revolutionaries Josef Steinberg, V. Trutovsky, Vladimir Karelin and A. Kolegayev wanted to join the Bolshevik government and thereby s upport Lenin's terrorism. This split the left wing faction of the Social Revolutionaries. Meanwhile, Lenin officially prohibited freemasonry to camouflage his designs. The Jacobins had done the same. He was unable to conceal the predominance of Jews within the government power apparatus. The Jews dominated everywhere, even from the autumn of 1917 - in the People's Commissariats and in the leadership of every institution, despite the fact that they made up only six per cent (6.1 million) of the population of Soviet-Russia. The mayor of Petrograd was the Jew Schreider. Even the leadership of the other parties consisted of Jews. But a considerable part of the Jews in the other parties left to join the Bolsheviks, who began a massive propaganda campaign to win the parliamentary elections. The Jews also controlled all the newspapers. Behind Izvestiya, which was originally a soviet newspaper and was later transformed into a government organ, were Yuri Steklov (Nakhamkis), Ziperovich, Goldenberg and other Jews. The periodical Kommunist was controlled by its Jewish editor-in-chief Vilhelm 234"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Knorin. His successor was another Jew - Stytsky. The editorial staff of Znamya Truda were Karl Lander, Levin and Noi Davidson. Volja Truda was led by Sachs, Polyansky and Katz. The Jew Moisei Kharitonov (Markovich) was named chief of the militia in Petrograd. He had travelled together with Lenin from Switzerland to Stockholm. He later became a Trotskyist. Grigori Sokolnikov (Brilliant) was the editor of Pravda at an earlier stage. After the Bolshevik take-over, he worked as chief commissar for banking affairs. He was appointed people's commissary for financial affairs in 1921. Stalin had him arrested in 1937 and he died two years later in the GULAG archipelago. The Polish Jew Jakub Hanecki (Furstenberg) became chief of the National Bank. The Bolsheviks failed to win the elections for the Constituent Assembly on the 25th (12th) of November 1917. Of 707 seats, the Social Revo- lutionaries won 410 and thereby secured a majority, the Bolsheviks won 175, the Liberals 105, the Mensheviks won only 16, the Bourgeois Cadets 17, the United People's Movements 86... So the Bolsheviks only got 24.7 per cent of the votes (9 562 358 votes of 40 million), despite the fact that they had manipulated the electorate as much as they could. Lenin had even abolished the freedom of the press by a decree on the 9th of November. Trotsky had ordered a demonstrative burning of the bourgeois newspaper Rech's entire edition one day earlier. Lenin banned all bourgeois parties at the end of December. The Constituent Assembly met on the 5th (18th) of January 1918 and rejected the Bolshevik government with 237 votes against 136. On the following day, Lenin had the \"Latvian riflemen\" (i.e. the German troops) dissolve the parliament. German soldiers opened fire on the crowd who tried to defend the Constituent Assembly. This was when the Bolsheviks actually performed their coup. They had no intention of leaving power at this stage. There was too much left to plunder. The Bolsheviks plundered riches amounting to 7.5 billion roubles in gold just from the churches, according to a conservative estimate by Western experts. The Bolsheviks had already set up revolutionary tribunals, had begun \"nationalising\" (that is - plundering) private property; they abolished the military ranks and in all secrecy founded the political police (the Cheka). There were an incredible number of freemasons among the Bolsheviks. Here I can further mention Nikolai Bukharin, Grigori Zinoviev, a member 235"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"of B'nai B'rith and the Grand Orient, according to Valeri Yemelyanov's book \"De-Zionisation\", Paris, 1979, p. 14), Mieczyslaw Kozlowski, Semyon Sereda, who later became people's commissary for agriculture, Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, Mikhail Skobelev, Nikolai Sokolov, Leonid Krasin, Gorky's wife J. Peshkova and her stepson Zinovi Peshkov (Yakov Sverdlov's brother). There were also a great number of freemasons occupying high posts within the Soviet administration in the 1950s, according to the freemason and publicist Yekaterina Kuskova (Novoye Russkoye Slovo, 1 st of August 1986, p. 6). Communist agents who were freemasons in the West received considerable help in their careers from their lodge brothers. Here I can mention Georges Ebon, who was arrested in France in the 1950s. (Terry Walton, \"KGB in France\", Moscow, 1993, pp. 67-68.) On the 28th of January 1918, Lenin decided to set up the Red Army and the Germans and Americans had to give all kinds of support to the Bolsheviks. The situation was catastrophic, because enemy troops were approaching Petrograd, and on March 11, 1918, the Bolshevik government fled to Moscow where it remained. The flight was organised by Alexander Shlyapnikov. (Stalin had him executed in 1937.) Moscow was afterwards made capital. Lenin also introduced the new (Gregorian) calendar. The Social Democratic Bolshevik Party was renamed the Communist Party on the 8th of March 1918. These Communists now formed a new, Jew-dominated government where Leon Trotsky became people's com- missary for military affairs. Another Jew, Georgi Chicherin (actually Ornatsky) whose Jewish mother was called Meierdorf, was named people's commissary for foreign affairs. Previously, he had twice been put in a mental hospital. This must have suited the Communists perfectly: the crazier, the better. The evil now broke out over the whole of society. Power became even more centralised than at the time of the Jacobins' coup in France. Trotsky wanted to see his subjects as militarised slaves. All forms of begging were forbidden, just like the Paris Commune had done by a decree on April 16th, 1871. Those breaking this decree were shot. The bourgeoisie were forced to sweep the streets and shovel snow. Their children were excluded from higher education. Lenin's instructions that the universities should welcome, above all, those people who just wanted a diploma rather than knowledge, were followed later as well. 236"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Even the early Taoists knew that: \"The more knowledge people have, the harder they are to control.\" In 1918 Patriarch Tikhon put the Soviet regime under a ban and proclaimed it Antichrist incarnate. He protested strongly when the Bolshe- viks began confiscating the property and wealth of the church. The GPU murdered him in May 1922. The Communist reign of terror knew no limits - all imaginable atrocities were permitted in the name of power. Moisei Uritsky (actually Boretsky) became chief of the Cheka in Petrograd. He worked in an especially brutal manner and gained the nick- name \"the butcher of Petrograd\". It was Uritsky who, with the aid of sailors and German soldiers, dissolved the Parliament in January 1918. Despite the fact that the Jewish \"revolutionaries\" and executioners preferred to live under assumed names, the ordinary people of Russia soon came to realise who ruled their land with an iron hand. The Jewish parties Bund and Po'alei Zion were still allowed to remain when the other parties were banned in 1920. The latter merged with the Communist Party in December 1928. Not one single synagogue was destroyed or converted into a public toilet or storehouse, as happened to the churches. Not a single rabbi was crucified. Many churches in Moscow were torn down in 1922 and instead a synagogue with space for two thousand people was built. A total of 60 000 churches were destroyed. The Jewish executioners used to shout: \"Long live the red terror! Death to the bourgeois!\" They soon enforced work duty. Vagabonds were exe- cuted on the spot. The Times admitted on September 18, 1920: \"The Soviet regime relies on Jewish brains, Latvian [i.e. German] and Chinese bayonets and the terrible Russian ignorance.\" In 1922, the correspondent for the British newspaper the Morning Post, Victor Marsden, published the names of all 545 civil servants within the government administration. 477 of them were Jews and only 30 were Russians (5.5 per cent). In 1920, a total of half a million Jews already worked in the Soviet party and state apparatus, in various institutions, as company leaders and in all other possible fields of practice within the Soviet regime. Many of those Jews had moved to Russia, primarily from Poland and Lithuania. (\"The Book of Russian Judaism\", New York, 1968, p. 137.) The Soviet 237"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Union's most important diplomats were also Jews. There were also Jewish functionaries within the first Soviet representation in Stockholm, for instance Aaron Zimmermann.

The lawyer of the Council of People's Commissaries was Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich (1873-1955). Yemelyan Yaroslavsky (Minei Gubelman, 1878-1943) became the Kremlin's Commissar and the secretary of the Central Com- mittee. It was he who led the take-over of power in Moscow. Other leading Jews: Moisei Frumkin (who became people's commissary for finance and foreign affairs), Adolf Yoffe, Karl Radek (Tobiach Sobel- sohn), Sara Khavkina (worked in the Central Committee), Alexander Ghe (Goldberg), Yuri Larin (actually Mikhail Lurye, 1882-1932), Vatslav Vorovsky (Orlovsky), Mieczyslaw Bronski (actually Moisei Warszawski, who became deputy commissary for trade and industry), Abram Skovno (1888-1938), David Rosenblum, Christian Rakovsky (Bulgarian Jew who became head of the red government in the Ukraine), Mikhail Lashevich, David Ryazanov (Goldenbach, 1870-1938, a Jew from Odessa, arrived from Switzerland with the second train, became director of the Marx Institute), Aaron Scheinman, Georgi Safarov, Yakov Surits, Aaron Soltz, Nikolai Krestinsky (member of the Central Committee), Yevgenia Bosh, Rulkovsky, Rozovsky, Samuel K aufman (who became a people's com- missary), Isidor Gukovsky (people's commissary), Feningstein (people's commissary), Olga Ravich (Sarra Gavvich, worked with people's commis- sary Feningstein), Yelena Stasova (secretary of the Central Committee), Theodor Rothstein (leading man in the Foreign Commissariat), Ivan Maisky (actually Steinman), Yan-Yakov Gamarnik, Moisei Rukhimovich, Alexander Shotman (1880-1939), Dashevich, Mikhail Kobetsky, Mikhail Goberman, Nikolai Gordon (Leiba Alie Chael, close collaborator with Grigori Zinoviev), Sergei Syrtsov, Mikhail Tomsky (Honigberg), Mikhail (Meier) Trilisser, Joseph Unschlicht, Arkadi Rosengoltz, Grigori Chud- novsky, Joseph Pyatnitsky (Tarsis) , Yevgeni Gnedin (Leon Helphand, son of Alexander Parvus who became head of the Paris Bureau of the Cheka), Bor and many, many others.

All kinds of Jewish speculators and anarchists, who were enamoured with Bolshevism, travelled to Soviet Russia at the very beginning. They came from many countries (from Turkey, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, Slovakia, and the United States of America). For example, a Bohemian Zionist comm unist from Prague, Ernest (Arnost) Kolman, worked in Moscow as a party functionary between 1918 and 1919 and as a politruk in Moscow and then in Siberia in the 1920s. He later worked with subversive activities in Germany where he was arrested and expelled to the Soviet Union. Most of them came from the United States. The most famous of these were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berk- man, who were sent to Petrograd by the American authorities in January 1920. Those anarchists had praised the Soviet state as paradise on earth around the United States. Later, they described how the Bolsheviks in Smolny's restaurant had introduced a system of privileges, where the leading Communists received better food than the others. A total of 34 levels of privileges were established. Here follows a list of the names of some important American Jews who worked in the Soviet state apparatus: Minnor was active as a political commissar at the Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Kisswalter worked in the Supreme Soviet as chairman of the economic restructuring committee, Kahan was active in the committee for the abolition of private banks, Simson co-ordinated the work of the Soviets, Gubelman was political commissar in Moscow's military district, Michelson was named adviser to the People's Bank and a high post was also held by Isaac Don Levine. Of course, the American Jews held high posts within the Cheka. Meich- man and Meherbey, who proved them selves especially dangerous, were among the most important Chekists in Petrograd. (Maurice Pinay, \"The Secret Driving Force of Communism\", p. 45.) Trotsky's comrade Clara Sheridan wrote quite openly in the New York World on December 13, 1923: \"The Communist leaders are Jews and Russia is entirely dominated by them. They are in every town, in every government bureau, in the offices and in the editorial staffs of the news- papers. They drive away the Russians and are responsible for the increasingly anti-Semitic attitude.\" 239"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" John Gates (actually Israel Regentreif), one of the Communist leaders in the United States, has also confirmed in his autobiography that the Jews held an absolutely dominant position in the Russian and the international Marxist movement. (John Gates, \"The Story of an American Communist\", New York, 1958.) Here I must point out that the Russian extremist Jews and their fellow travellers were only tools in the hands of Jewish international bankers, who wanted to transport as much wealth as possible out of Russia. Everything that happened during the Jacobin's reign of terror in France was repeated in Russia. The banker Jacob Schiff had given Leon Trotsky 20 million dollars to organise a Bolshevik take-over. That gamble certainly paid off. 600 million roubles in gold were transferred to the United States of America between 1918 and 1922, according to the historian Gary Allen. In the first half of 1921 alone, the banking house of Kuhn, Loeb and Co. made a profit of 102 290 000 dollars on the wealth the Bolsheviks had robbed, according to the New York Times, August 23rd, 1921. Multiply that sum by one hundred and you have the present -day value of that money. The Russian historian Dmitri Volkogonov revealed after findings in the Communist Party archives that \"just the Tsarina's private reserves amounted to 475 million roubles in gold (plus 7 million for the crown jewels)\".

Some Swedish journalists (including Staffan Skott) have, in accord with the prevailing myth, tried to explain that most of this wealth was handed over to the Communist parties in other countries, while millions of Russians died of starvation. That is not entirely accurate. According to the historian Igor Bunich, Lenin and Trotsky took care of this money personally. The gold, meanwhile, was smuggled out of Russia and deposited into personal bank accounts around the world. (30 tons of gold per year were produced in the Tsarist era in Russia.) That was apparently the reason why the British newspaper The Guardian, in March 1923, called the Bolsheviks the Party of the Yellow Satan. Here follows an actual case. The freemason Yuri Lomonosov, who was the right-hand man of the minister of communications during the time of the Provisional Govern- ment, lived in the United States between 1918 and 1919. He returned to Russia and held a high post in the Bolshevik regime. In 1920, the Tsar's gold was exported to the United States of America under the control of this same professor Lomonosov and by the aid of Jacob Schiff's banking corporation Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and the Jewish banker Olof Aschberg (Nya Banken) in Sweden. 241"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Three shiploads with a total of 540 packing-cases of gold were sent away from the harbour of Tallinn in the Republic of Estonia. (U.S. State Department Decimal File, 861.51/837, 4th of October 1920.) Professor Lomonosov returned to the United States at the same time, when his mission had been accomplished. Each case was worth 60 000 roubles in gold. The total value was thus 32.4 million. The Bolsheviks also used the Harju Bank in Estonia to transfer money. Eventually, all of the Bolsheviks' gold reserves ended up in the United States, according to the Russian historian Igor Bunich. Over 600 000 miners died under forced labour in the gold mines of Kolyma alone. To ensure an even greater success, the banker James Warburg from New York and Frankfurt am Main also financed Lenin and Trotsky. (Gary Allen, \"Say 'NO!' to the New World Order\", California, 1987, p. 22.) While the murdering and plundering was going on, over 1.6 million Russians escaped abroad. The Communist Party's 19 564 leading Jews and the Jewish Communist Parties Bund and Po'alei Zion tried to gain complete control over the Russian society. Hundreds of thousands of Rus- sians were forced to become Communists. Meanwhile, these Jewish extre- mists, who were obsessed by Marx ist hallucinations, transformed Russia into a temple of evil. Soviet Union became a new perfect temple of Solomon for the Jewish freemasons. Over one hundred million people were sacrificed there. In the Soviet Union, Masonic terms typical of the Communist movement were used constantly. They wanted to \"build a new society\" and a \"better and brighter future\". Or they wanted to rebuild the old (perestroika). The emotive propaganda apparatus was completely in the hands of \"re- volutionary\" Jews. They even had their own news agency, YETA, which diligently reported all manifestations of anti-Semitism. The Jewish functionaries even began to publish Pravda in Yiddish (Varhait) on the 3rd of March 1918, and from August 1918, the same newspaper was also published in Hebrew (Emet). (The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia, Moscow, 1932, Vol. 24, p. 120.) Jewish authors produced combat literature. Jewish composers com- posed all kinds of marches and mythsongs to inspire ordinary Russians to heroic acts in the name of Socialism. Much was staked, also abroad, on the songs of Isaac Dunayevsky and the Pokrass brothers. 242"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Dmitri Pokrass' work included the well-known \"Konarmeiskaya\", which the Swedish socialists eagerly sang under the name of \"The Song About the Reaction\", and the \"Budyonny March\". The latter was composed by Dmitri Pokrass at twenty years of age in Kiev in the summer of 1920. In the same year, his brother who was two years older, wrote \"We Build the Nation\", where it is claimed that the Red Army was the strongest of all. The Red Army soldiers hold their weapons firmly in callused fists. This revolutionary song was taken over by the Swedish socialists who made it their own anthem. This song was sung at the funeral of Olof Palme (the Swedish Prime Minister, murdered in 1986) in Stockholm. Samuil Pokrass was later invited to Hollywood. Of course, there was nothing to prevent his emigration to the United States. He died in New York in 1939. His brother, Dmitri Pokrass, later won the Stalin award for his contribution to the process of indoctrination. Isaac Dunayevsky's most famous melody was named \"The March of the Young Enthusiasts\". Jewish composers (Leon Knipper, Alexander Tsfasman, Matvei Blanter, Yan Frenk el, Alexander Kolker, Mark Fradkin, Oskar Feltsman, N. Brodsky, I. Shva rts, Eduard Kolmanovsky, Venyamin Basner, Alexander Flyarkovsky, Al exander Bronevitsky, David Tukhma- nov and others) maintained their control over the Russian musical culture. The Jews, of course, also dominated the most important branch of the media - the film industry. The most important film directors were: Leo Arnstam, Abram Room, Leonid Trauberg, Friedrich Ermler, Dziga Ver- tov, Josef Heifitz, Mikhail Romm, Mark Donskoy, Sergei Jutkevich, Juli Raizman... Vsevolod Meyerhold developed the new theatre. The Jewish director and freemason Sergei Eisenstein made several propaganda films (\"The Armoured Cruiser Potyomkin\", \"The Strike\", \"October\"). The screenplay for his most famous film, \"The Armoured Cruiser Potyomkin\", was written by a Jewish publicist, Alexei Kapler. Even the advertisement poster for this film was drawn by the Jewish Steinberg brothers from Sweden. The Jews dominated the Ukrainian cultural life to an even higher degree (76 per cent of those registered in the cultural unions were Jews). Lenin also took the opportunity to proclaim sexual freedom in December 1917 (even homosexuality was decriminalised), as happened after the Jacobin coup in 1791. Stalin, however, prohibited homosexuality in 1934, at the same time as he banned abortion and made the very liberal 243"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"marriage laws stricter. Lenin made the Soviet organs proclaim: \"From the age of 18, every young woman is the property of the state.\" Unmarried women had to register themselves at the Bureau of Free Love. Omission was punished severely. Each registered woman had to choose a man between 19 and 50 years of age. The men also had the right to choose women, but they had to carry documentation that they belonged to the proletariat. The others were not allowed to have a sex-life since they were class-enemies (i.e. enemies of the Jews). In the interest of the state, men had the right to choose women registered at the Bureau of Free Love, even if the said women did not comply. The children that were born from these unions became the property of the republic. (Mikhail and August Stern, \"Iron Curtain for Love\", Stockholm, 1982, p. 26.) Jewish Bolsheviks frequently organised naked marches and propagated group-sexuality. Those new measures caused deep psychological distur- bances in the traditionally family-oriented Russian people. The com- munist leaders wanted to eliminate the concept and practice of family life. Abortion, meanwhile, was legalised. Rape also became far more common. The communist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky immediately propagated the new policy in the following way: Any girl at all, young and beautiful will I rape. And contemptuously will I spit on her! The Soviet functionaries later tried to claim that his poems were ironic. The moral norms were quickly subverted in Soviet Russia. One person who became an especially \"good example\" for this process of dissolution was the nymphomaniac Alexandra Kollontay. As a people's commissary, she gave orders for several sailors to come to her every day. Their job was to sleep with her. She was especially excited by the sailor's uniform. The party functionary Oleg Agranyants revealed in 1989 that Alexandra Kollontay had earlier been a brothel-keeper. As soon as the moral norms had been dissolved, sexuality was prohibi- ted. The goal had been reached and a new slogan was invented: \"Sexuality is the enemy of the revolution!\" Women were to become draught-animals instead. The Jewish commissary for education and culture, the freemason 244"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Anatoli Lunacharsky declared: \"That little institution of manners which is the family... that entire curse... shall become a closed chapter.\" In this way, the Russian society had been transformed into a herd of cattle, just as the freemason Mikhail Bakunin had predicted. \"Dictionnaire Universel\" (p. 114) confirms that Bakunin really was a freemason. Bakunin maintained that the red bureaucracy would cramp the morals and ideas of the people. The Jewish psychologist Alexander Zalkind admitted in his book \"The Revolution and the Youth\" (Moscow, 1925), that the Communist Party was to subject the Russian people to racial manipulation. He wrote: \"Society has the total and unconditional right to intervene in the sexual life of the people and improve the race by introducing an artificial sexual selection.\" In other words, the Jewish extremists wanted to make sure that they would have suitable (not too intelligent) slaves in the future. Oleg Platonov writes the following in his book \"The History of the Russian People in the Twentieth Century\" (Moscow, 1997, p. 520): \"One of the first symbols of Bolshevism was the swastika, proposed by Jewish officials as the chief element of the arms of state. Among other uses, the reversed swastika appeared on uniform sleeves in the Red Army, and, in 1918, on bank notes in denominations of five and ten thousand roubles.\" He goes on to state: \"The star of David was used on the first Bolshevik documents and Soviet military insignia. It was later superseded by the five- pointed Masonic star.\" The Jewish Communist leadership introduced a great number of Masonic symbols and terms - above all the red, five-pointed star (the star of Solomon). The term of address became tovarishch (comrade). This is what the freemason of the second degree is called. The higher Masonic lodges were called councils, just as in Judaism. There was also a Supreme Council. Those on whom was later conferred the Order of Lenin were called the Knights of Lenin's (Masonic) Order. Every Master Mason uses a ritual hammer. We can find the background of this tradition in the Old Testament, where it is written that Yahweh has been like unto a hammer in his destruction of other peoples (Jeremiah 50:23). The freemason and communist leader Mao Zedong also declared in 1950: \"Communism is a hammer which crushes our enemies.\" The sickle also comes from freemasonry. It symbolises destruction (the gelding of Urano). It is also mentioned in Jeremiah (50:16). The Zionist 245"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Socialist Party, which acted most intensively in Russia during the coup attempts in 1905-06, was called The Sickle. With the help of Great Britain, America, Germany and other countries, the Soviet regime was established in Russia. That regime propagated terror, deceit, plunder and political prostitution. Communism became especially dangerous because it justified its incredibly evil crimes with an equally incredible propaganda of lies. So, Russia became infected with Marxism which, like a cancer, destroyed the body of society and began to spread the red disease abroad to other countries. Those Russians who survived were used as cudgels against the other nations, which were subdued by the Communist masters. The responsibility lies above all with those who used these cudgels as weapons. One nation after another was more or less eliminated. Approxi- mately 800 000 Bashkirians (57 per cent of their population) were liquidated in the years 1917-1922. (Kaarel Haav, Rein Ruutsoo, \"The Estonian People and Stalinism\", Tallinn, 1990, p. 36.) Lenin stressed that he welcomed the assimilation of different national groups; everything which led to different peoples becoming a single nation. (Lenin, \"Works\", Vol. 20, p. 18.) The reason for the deportation of the Tartars, Armenians and Greeks from the Crimea in World War Two has now also been revealed. The Jewish Communists had suggested the founding of a Jewish republic in the Crimea on the 15th of February 1944, but the plans were never fully realised (Ogonyok, No. 5, 1990, p. 22). Lenin's crime syndicate became more and more powerful, since it was supported by international bankers and in the beginning also by the German government. On the 18th of May 1918, the German Foreign Minister Richard von Kiihlmann sent a telegram to Ambassador Wilhelm von Mirbach in Moscow: \"Spend large amounts, since it is in our interest that the Bolsheviks remain in power.\" On the 3rd of June 1918, Mirbach reported that he needed 3 million marks for this purpose. On the 6th of July 1918, the Bolshevik terror regime was about to collapse in connection with the revolt of the Social Revolutionaries but was saved by the German troops and not by \"Latvian riflemen\" as the official propaganda claimed.

A few weeks after this demonstration (May 22) the German Landeswehr (army) crushed the Soviet occupation in Riga. 247"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The German government spent a total of 50 million marks on the Bol- sheviks, according to the Jewish socialist politician Eduard Bernstein in Germany (Vorwarts, 14th of January 1921). After World War Two, American soldiers found the archives of the German Foreign Ministry in the Harz Mountains. The archive contained documents from the years 1876-1920. Some of these papers were published in the periodical International Affairs in London in 1957. In the same year, the collection of documents \"Lenin's Return to Russia\", edited by Werner Halweg, was published in Holland. Communism was an ideology, which depended on violence to survive. The truth needs no violence. Meanwhile, the Communist system only encouraged the lowest of all human mentalities. Bandits ruled the good. This reign brought about the spiritual death of the Russian society. This was the very aim of the Illuminati. This time their terror was called revolution, and this time it was a huge one. The Communists primarily propagated class-war and hatred, by which means the people were turned into a rabble, a herd. The Czech author Karel Capek declared that the Soviet system was an attempt to tear the human world to pieces and achieve total international confusion. Nature had to be subdued - it was regarded as an enemy. Their central slogan was: \"We need no alms from nature, we will take from nature!\" In that way the Bolsheviks began a massive campaign of environmental destruction. It was Lenin who, on the 21st of December 1920, gave orders to irrigate the area around the Aral Sea with artificial canals. Through this decision, he ordered the destruction of the Aral Sea. This salt-lake has almost dried up today and the surrounding land is poisoned with high levels of salt and chemicals. Lenin also wanted other countries under his sway. That was why he ordered Maxim Litvinov (Hennokh Wallakh) and Theodor Rothstein to begin preparations for an international infiltration net. Lenin financed that operation with diamonds found during the plunder of Russia. Comintern decided in 1919 that they would convert all the European nations into Soviets. The Masonic Bolsheviks made attempts in Hungary, Bavaria, Slovakia. The Jewish Spartacist leadership in Germany also attempted to impose a red dictatorship. Eventually their powers focused on the under- developed China. Lenin asserted that internationalism meant that one must support the revolutionary movement in all nations, without exception. (Lenin, 248"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"\"Collected Works\", Vol. 30, p. 170.) This was, of course, true imperialism. Karl Radek stated in a similar vein that: \"Communists all over the world must also be Russian patriots, since Russia is the only nation ruled by the working class.\" Pravda wrote on December 25, 1918: \"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania disturb our penetration of Western Europe. They cut Soviet-Russia off from revolutionary Germany. Such an obstruction must be annihilated. The Baltic ports would give us the opportunity to speed up the revolutionary development in Scandinavia.\" It seems clear that Lenin hoped to introduce the Communist system in Germany too. Another Jewish \"revolutionary\" and freemason, Karl Kautsky, was opposed to this. The leading German freemasons had entirely different plans for Germany. Lenin, of course, was extremely angry with Kautsky and called him a renegade. Lenin, at this point, had to re-draw his plans for world revolution. He had founded a special orga- nisation for this very purpose - Comintern (The Third International). Its executive organ became the International Red Aid. The best Comintern agent was the Jewish Communist Jacob Kirchstein, according to the defected GRU general, Valter Krivitsky (actually Schmelka Ginsberg). Lenin gave 50 million roubles to Comintern in November 1919 to finance subversive action abroad, according to a secret report, which has now been released. The fact that the Bolshevik criminals gained a stable base in Russia meant bad news for the rest of the world, since it worsened the quality of life everywhere. The Communists' goal was to use mass terror to scare all their subjects into total submission. How the mass terror began is more closely described in the next chapter. 249"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF MURDER It was the morning of the 30th of August 1918. A cyclist turned up in Petrograd's Palace Square at around nine o'clock. He stopped at house number 6, the headquarters of the Commune Commissariat for Internal Affairs and the Extra-Ordinary Commission, the Cheka. This terror organisation had been founded on December 7th, 1917, but officially it did not exist. Only on the 18th December 1927 did Pravda publish the decree officially establishing the Cheka. The cyclist was a young man wearing a leather jacket and an officer's cap. He left his bicycle by the door and entered. It was reception day at the Commissariat for Internal Affairs. The visitors were waiting in the hall and did not notice the young man who sat down near the outer door. Moisei Uritsky (actually Boretsky) arrived in his car at around ten o'clock. He was the chairman of the Petrograd Cheka. Uritsky became infamous as the \"Butcher of Petrograd\". He threatened to kill all Russians who spoke their native language well. He claimed there was no greater pleasure than watching monarchists die, according to Igor Bunich (\"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992) and Oleg Platonov (\"The History of the Russian People in the Twentieth Century\", Moscow, 1997, p. 613). Uritsky had executed 5000 officers with his own hands. Now he quickly walked towards the lift door. Suddenly several shots were heard. It was the young man in the leather jacket who had approached Uritsky and shot him in his head and body. Uritsky collapsed. The murderer ran out into the street, jumped on his bicycle and began pedalling as fast as he could. When they began to chase him by car, he threw away his bicycle and ran into the British Representation. He left the representation after having donned a longcoat. When he saw Red Guards, he opened fire but was quickly overpowered. This was the official description of Moisei Uritsky's murder. The suspect was a 22-year-old Jewish student of technology, Leonid Kanne- 250"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"gisser. This cock-and-bull story was published in 1975 in the book \"The Elimination of the Anti-Soviet Subversive Movement\" by D. Golinkov, who used to investigate especially important cases at the office of the Public Prosecutor of the Soviet Union. The doctor of history, P. Sofinov, described the same event in a very different manner in 1960, in his book about the history of the Cheka. On the morning of the 30th of August, the Social Revolutionary Kennigisser, who was the freemason Savinkov's agent as well as a spy for the British and the French, murdered the chief of the Cheka in Petrograd, Moisei Uritsky, in his office. Felix Dzerzhin sky (actually Rufin) gave orders to search the British Embassy on the 31st of August. The Social Revolutionary Kennigisser had become the student Kanne- gisser in the meantime, and now he had murdered Uritsky in the hallway of the Cheka instead of in Uritsky's office. Sofinov's version probably seemed too contrived to be credible. Grigori Nilov's (Alexander Kravtsov's) book \"The Grammar of Leni- nism\" was published in London in 1990. In this book the author gave neither theory credibility. Instead he claimed that the Bolshevik party and the central organisation of the Cheka with Lenin and Dzerzhinsky at the head were behind Uritsky's murder. The book \"The Parly's Gold\" by the historian Igor Bunich was published in St. Petersburg in 1992. Igor Bunich reveals that the murder of Uritsky was organised by Dzerzhinsky's protege Gleb Boky who later became Dzerzhinsky's successor. The Jewish Chekist, Boky, used to feed the flesh of the executed to the animals in the zoo. Igor Bunich demonstrated that Lenin personally gave the order to murder Uritsky and also to stage an attempt on his own life to give himself a reason to immediately begin the mass terror against the Russian population. The murder was also Uritsky's punishment for stealing some of the confiscated riches from behind Lenin's back, together with V. Volodarsky (actually Moisei Goldstein) and the freemason Andronnikov (who was chief of the Cheka in Kronstadt). Everything was sold via certain Scandinavian banks - but more about that later. The murder of Sergei Kirov (actually Kostrikov) on December 1, 1934 was in many ways similar to Uritsky's murder. Kirov was officially murdered by Leonid Nikolaiev. Both of those high party functionaries had been murdered professionally and without obstacles. Both were warned in 251"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"advance. Both murderers could freely gain entrance to the respective buildings. It is clear today that Stalin was behind the murder of Kirov, despite the fact that there are no documents about this. There is no lack of evidence and logical arguments. Kirov's bodyguard was prevented from accom- panying him, so that the real murderer could shoot the Leningrad Party Secretary at exactly 4:30 in the afternoon. That event provided a good reason for Stalin to begin his campaign of mass terror. At least 7 million people were killed during that campaign and 18 million were imprisoned. 97 per cent of the participants at the 1934 Party Congress were liquidated. Kravtsov presented some suspect circumstances in connection with the murder of Uritsky, who was also a member of the Central Committee. No analysis was made of Kannegisser's revolver and ammunition. The Cheka did not seem to want the truth to come out. Kannegisser was never taken to trial, but was illegally killed. If Kannegisser had really been a Social Revolutionary, then a trial would have been a propaganda triumph for the regime. It would have been publicly announced who planned the murder. But not even the motive for Uritsky's murder was ever revealed. In contrast, it is known now that Lenin became furious when he received reports from Alexander Parvus in Berlin in which it was revealed that someone in Petrograd had stolen from Lenin. Just before Dzerzhinsky had travelled to Switzerland to investigate the situation. It turned out that not all the cargoes had reached Berlin; not all the money had ended up in the Swiss bank accounts of Lenin and his approved comrades. Some cargoes of \"nationalised\" goods had been sent to Sweden, including many valuable icons (some of these are still on display in the National Museum in Stockholm), the money had gone into the hands of other people than Trotsky and Lenin. Stalin transferred Lenin's foreign money deposits to Moscow in the 1930s. In 1998, an account was found in Switzerland, which belonged to Vladimir Ulyanov. No one had touched it since 1945. There was slightly less than one hundred Swiss francs left (50 USD). The guilty parties were soon found, in June 1918. The main suspects were Uritsky, Volodarsky and Andronnikov (the chief of the Cheka in Kronstadt). They had stolen whole cargoes and sold everything through different Scandinavian banks. 78 milli on roubles in gold had vanished in this way.

At various auctions in Stockholm in the autumn of 1995, Russia began buying back valuable antique furniture, which had been illicitly transported to Sweden. This came as an unpleasant surprise for Parvus, since Uritsky and Volo- darsky had been his favourite disciples. Parvus had founded a Yiddish newspaper, Arbaiter Stimme (Worker's Voice) for Uritsky in Copenhagen, on which Grigori Chudnovsky and Nikolai Gordon (Leiba Alie Hael Gordon) had also worked. The latter was a Latvian Jew and a close collaborator with Grigori Zinoviev (Ovsei Radomyslsky). In Moscow, Lenin promised to solve the problem. And indeed, Volo- darsky was murdered in the same month. Uritsky led the investigation and learned the truth, upon which he also was murdered. Kannegisser declared that he had acted alone. The Social Revolutio- naries denied all knowledge of Kannegisser. He had never been a member of their party. Even the circumstance that Kannegisser was wearing an officer's cap was peculiar when others had hidden their caps to avoid being executed. It seems he wanted to draw attention to himself. The fact that he ran into the British Embassy to change was also surprising. He only took off his leather jacket and put on a longcoat. Why, then, did he run away from the site of the murder at all? It was also very odd that he managed to approach Uritsky unhindered and that he was able to escape with the same ease after shooting him. It was impossible to enter without a special permit, since there were armed guards at the door. Unknown persons could not even speak to Uritsky on the telephone. Mikhail Aldanov has confirmed this. Why did no one react? They saw and heard everything! Mikhail Aldanov demonstrated in his study that Kannegisser could not shoot. Aldanov knew both him and his family well. How then, could Kannegisser hit Uritsky in his head like a sharpshooter when the latter was walking quickly towards the lift? It appears that Kannegisser was used as a shadow-man, just as Leonid Nikolaiev was later used in Kirov's murder. Moreover, Lenin, on the afternoon of the 30th of August 1918, sent Dzerzhinsky a short letter, where two people who had shot Uritsky were named. Why has nothing been mentioned about these two later? Who were they? 253"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The fact that Kannegisser admitted to the crime is irrelevant, since the Chekist torturers could make anyone admit to anything. In this case, the opportunity was taken to accuse the right wing of the Social Revo- lutionaries of the murder. It has now been confirmed that the central organisation of the Cheka, headed by the freemason Gleb Boky, was behind Uritsky's murder. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 47.) So the motive was to exact revenge on Uritsky for his thefts. The main purpose was to be given a reason to begin the mass terror. The murder of Kirov had the same motive. But was there not also another reason to dispose of Uritsky now that he had solved the mystery of another murder? V. Volodarsky (Moisei Goldstein) had been murdered under puzzling circumstances on June 20, 1918. He was the people's commissary for press, propaganda and agitation. His murderer was at once stamped as a right wing Social Revolutionary, despite the fact that he was never caught. The Bolshevik leadership in Moscow wanted to begin the massacre immediately. Moisei Uritsky, who investigated the murder of Volodarsky, refused to agree to this. He suspected the hand of the central leadership behind this murder. That was why it was impossible to use this murder as a pretext. Lenin was beside himself with rage. This is clear from Lenin's angry telegrams, sent on the 26th of June 1918 to Grigori Zinoviev, the chairman of the Petrograd Party Committee. Lenin wrote, among other things: \"We in the Central Committee heard today that Piter's workers want to respond to Volodarsky's murder with terror but you (not you personally, but Piter's civil servants) held back. I protest strongly!\" The only one who could ignore the demands to begin the terror was Petrograd's 45-year-old chief Chekist, Moisei Uritsky. According to Alexander Kravtsov, this telegram clearly shows that the murder of Volo- darsky was planned and organised by the Cheka under orders from Lenin. The historian Igor Bunich confirmed this. Volodarsky and Uritsky belonged to the 275 Menshevik conspirators who, together with Trotsky, had boarded the Kristianiafjord in New York harbour on March 27, 1917 to travel to Petrograd, where they all joined with the Bolshevik leader, Lenin. Volodarsky had lived in the United States since 1913. Several strange circumstances put Uritsky on the track of Volodarsky's murderers. The car in which Volodarsky had been travelling had suddenly 254"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"stopped in a street in Petrograd on the 20th of June 1918. Out of petrol, it was claimed. Volodarsky stepped out of the car together with three com- rades to walk to the District Soviet, which was nearby. Suddenly a terrorist appeared and shot him three times at close range before escaping. Volodarsky died immediately: one of the bullets hit his heart. The terrorist threw a bomb to halt his pursuers. There is no information as to whether or not the bomb exploded. Uritsky was most surprised by the fact that Lenin, on the following day, accused the right wing of the Social Revolutionaries. And abracadabra! During the terror of 1922, a Social Revolutionary, Sergeiev, admitted to Volodarsky's murder. Uritsky knew it was no accident that the car had stopped at the exact spot where the terrorist was waiting. You don't carry bombs around with you just for self-protection! How could the murderer have known that the petrol would run out in this very street? Uritsky could draw only one logical conclusion - the murder had been organised by the Moscow Cheka and could only have been approved by Lenin. Lenin and Dzerzhinsky of course knew that Uritsky had worked out the truth about the murder, since he sabotaged the demands for mass terror. V. Volodarsky and Moisei Uritsky. 255 "},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"No other functionary was able to counter such a demand. That was another reason why he was regarded as an especially suitable victim, who was later presented as an innocent martyr. That happened with Volodarsky and also with Kirov, Frunze and many others. It was the best way to get rid of undesirable comrades. Lenin had another devilish plan in reserve. He had chosen the same day - the 30th of August 1918. Through this plan Lenin wanted to be certain to legalise the mass terror, which had already begun in the Penza district, and to spread it to other areas as well. Thus on the 30th of August, at about ten in the evening, Lenin spoke at an agitation rally at Michelson's factory in Moscow. After the meeting, the Communist leader went out into the yard where he began to converse with the workers by his car. Suddenly three pistol shots were heard, upon which the workers jumped back and Lenin fell to the ground. Two bullets had wounded him. The third slightly wounded the matron M. Popova from the Petropavlovsk hospital. Lenin's Jewish chauffeur, Stepan Gil, who was sitting in the car, claimed that a woman with a handgun was standing just three paces away from Lenin. Gil rushed out of the car, but the woman threw the pistol at his feet and vanished into the crowd. The wounded Lenin was helped into the car and was driven to the hospital. S. Batulin, vice commissar of the fifth infantry division in Moscow, was also present at the meeting. He immediately chased after the woman. In Serpukhovka, he noticed a strange woman who was carrying a document briefcase and an umbrella. She looked like she was seeking to avoid the pursuers. Batulin asked why she was standing under the tree. The woman answered: \"Why do you want to know?\" Batulin searched her pockets, took her briefcase and umbrella and ordered her to follow him. On the way, Batulin asked why she had tried to shoot Lenin. The woman again answered: \"Why do you want to know?\" Then Batulin asked her directly: \"Was it you who tried to shoot Lenin?\" She replied in the affirmative. The chairman of the factory committee, Ivanov, recognised the woman. He had seen her before Lenin's arrival. She was then handed over to the organ of preliminary investigatory.

The 28-year-old Fanny Kaplan (actually Feiga Roydman) supposedly explained that her attempt on Lenin's life was a personal political action, but the doctor of history P. Sofinov has described the chain of events quite differently in his book about the history of the Cheka (published in 1960). I shall give a brief outline of his version. After the meeting at Michelson's factory, Lenin left the shell workshop together with the workers and walked towards the car. Suddenly a shot was fired, then another and also a third. Lenin was wounded by two bullets and collapsed just a few paces away from the car. The bullets were poisoned. The female terrorist did not manage to escape, since some children who had been standing nearby pointed out Fanny Kaplan to some workers who apprehended her and took her to the Cheka. Fanny Kaplan was a Social Revolutionary who organised terrorist actions against the Bolsheviks and the Soviet leadership under orders from the British-French imperialists. Despite the fact that Lenin was badly wounded, his iron physique managed to survive both the wounds and the poison. That was the way in which the \"historian\" P. Sofinov described the attempt in 1960. In 1924, Dr Weisbrod confirmed in Yaroslavsky's book that Lenin recovered quickly. Did the poison have no effect at all then? It was officially explained that the poison of the Social Revolutionaries was of inferior quality and had no effect. Dr Weisbrod never mentioned any poison. This story was invented later. In 1938 the Stalinist propaganda asserted that it was Nikolai Bukharin (Dolgolevsky), member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, also called the \"party's darling\", who had organised the attempt on Lenin together with the Social Revolutionaries. Kaplan had been his minion. He was also accused of organising the murder of Kirov and was supposed to have made plans to murder Joseph Stalin too. Bukharin was also accused of the murders of Menzhinsky, Kuibyshev and Gorky. Finally, he was supposed to have tried to poison Yezhov, chief of the secret police. There is actually another version, from the 30th of August 1918. That was an open message written by Yakov Sverdlov (actually Yankel-Aaron Movshevich Solomon). He maintained that two people were arrested for this attempt. Sverdlov claimed that t hey were definitely right wing Social 257"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Revolutionaries acting for the British and the French. This document was even displayed in the Lenin Museum. It was said that Protopopov, one of the most violent enemies of the Soviet Union, had worked together with Kaplan and also helped her escape. Protopopov had been executed immediately, it was claimed. This version was never again mentioned after the 3rd of December 1918. Neither did the history professor Sofinov appear to know anything about it. But Lenin's first question after he had been hit was: \"Did you catch him?\" So it was a man who fired the shots! Professor A. Litvinov later managed to prove that it was the Chekist Protopopov who fired the shots at Lenin. The agent was arrested and killed on the same, or the following, day. Kaplan did not know what had happened and stubbornly kept to her version. (Dmitry Volkogonov, \"Lenin\", Moscow, 1994,1, p. 397.) A longcoat and blazer, which the Bolshevik leader had been wearing at the time of the attempt, were also exhibited in the Lenin Museum in Moscow. Four holes had been marked - two red ones, to show which bullets had hit the body, and two white ones where the bullets had passed through without damaging Lenin. All four shots had been fired at his back. The official version claims that only three shots were fired. The bullet, which wounded Popova appears to have been one of those which passed through Lenin's clothes. Yakov (Yankel) Yurovsky, who had earlier organised the murder of the Tsar and his family, was only allowed to search the site of the attempt some three days later. He found four (!) cartridges. But only three shots had been fired! (Ibid, p. 398.) There were also some other inexplicable factors involved. If the party leadership had not planned Uritsky's murder, Lenin would surely have cancelled his meeting on the same evening or at least taken certain precautions. This is the opinion of Grigori Nilov (Alexander Kravtsov) in his book \"The Grammar of Leninism\". He pointed out the following ambiguities in the official description. Was Fanny Kaplan really holding a briefcase and an umbrella in her hands while firing the shots? Did she really remain under the tree and wait for her pursuers to see the briefcase and umbrella? Why did she only throw away the gun and not the briefcase and umbrella? Alexander Kravtsov was of the opinion that such political terrorists usually do not flee, but remain by their victims. It is especially puzzling that, in the 258"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"official version, the workers allowed her to escape. And where were the bodyguards? The chauffeur Gil wrote in his memoirs that Lenin did not have a single bodyguard with him. Neither did the party committee of the factory receive him! It was most peculiar that Lenin did not have any bodyguards with him on this particular occasion. The Bolsheviks took particular care to protect themselves against all possible enemies just after the seizure of power. In the beginning they used only Chinese and German bodyguards. When the Soviet government moved from Petrograd to Moscow on 10- 12 March 1918, extraordinary precautionary measures were taken and masquerade tricks were used to confuse the \"enemies of the people\". At this point, the Bolsheviks were close to being overthrown. The train which was to bring the Bolshevik leaders and their \"government\" (Sovnarkom) from Petrograd to Moscow was stopped by around 600 Russian sailors and soldiers who attacked with the war-cry: \"Destroy the Jewish government that has sold Russia to the Germans!\" An even stronger force of bodyguards who had accompanied the train unfortunately fought the crowd back. (Platonov, \"The History of the Russian People in the 20th Century\", part I, Moscow, 1997, p. 536.) It appears from the information in Ryabchikov's book \"Behind the Horizon Lies a Horizon\" that Lenin was guarded by sailors armed with machine guns and armoured vehicles in March 1918. Lenin usually had bodyguards with him at all times, according to the Chekist Alexander Orlov. There was only one officer at Michelson's factory on the 30th of August 1918 - Batulin. Lenin and Krupskaya were photographed together with bodyguards on August 28th, just two days before the attempt. Why did Lenin not wish to have any bodyguards with him on August 30th? There was never any explanation why no investigation was made of the pistol, which was found at the feet of the chauffeur, Gil. Did the assassin really use the weapon, which was found? Another revolver was found later. During the investigation, no one was interested in how Kaplan held the revolver, briefcase and umbrella. This is why there is reason to believe that another weapon was used in the \"attempt on Lenin's life\". Now the most puzzling circumstance of all: Fanny Kaplan was actually half-blind. It was dark at around eleven o'clock on the evening of August 30th when the attack took place. She could hardly see anything at all in 259"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"semi-darkness. Her acquaintances explained that she usually looked frightened and confused on such occasions. Her eyesight had been damaged in a bomb explosion. In Tsarist times, she was sentenced to death as a Social Revolutionary terrorist, but since she was under-age at the time, the sentence was changed on the 8th of January 1907 to penal servitude for life. She was periodically completely blind and suffered from headaches. She was released in connection with the Bolsheviks' take-over. So it was quite impossible for this half-blind woman to have shot Lenin in semi-darkness. It must be presumed that the other person, whom Yakov Sverdlov mentioned, had a steady hand and good eyesight in order not to kill Lenin but just to wound him slightly. Only the Chekist Protopopov could have done this. It would have been simple to murder Lenin in the factory yard if this had been the \"assassin's\" intention. There were no bodyguards there. For this reason, Russia's Ministry of Security decided to begin an investigation into the affair on the 19th of June 1992. The case was later taken over by the Russian Office of the Public Prosecutor. That was a sensible decision, since they found information suggesting that Fanny Kaplan had not been at the Michelson factory at all that particular evening (Istochnik, No. 2, 1993). The new investigation could not certify that either of the two bullets was fired from the Browning Kaplan was supposed to have used. It is known that a factory worker turned up three days later with a Browning pistol. It was never clarified then whether this was the same weapon or not. Stalin was earlier suspected of this shooting, but the historian Igor Bunich has now reached the conclusion that Lenin organised the \"assassination attempt\" himself. Even if the head of the Cheka, Dzer- zhinsky, gave orders for Lenin's bodyguards to leave his side on the 30th of August, Lenin himself would never have agreed to this, coward that he was. This means that Lenin did not want any bodyguards with him on that day, since he had planned the attempt personally. Otherwise he would never again have showed his face in public after what had happened in Petrograd on that morning. Dzerzhinsky helped to conceal the truth, so that it would be impossible to reveal who was really responsible for the shooting. He carried that secret with him to his grave. The Polish Jew Dzerzhinsky, who was an infamous drug-addict and sadist, died suddenly 260"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"under mysterious circumstances on the 20th of July 1926 when he began to express his desire to have as much power as Stalin. Stalin was also interested in \"inheriting\" the money Dzerzhinsky had put into foreign bank accounts. That was typical of Stalin who, for example, gave orders on the 31st of October 1925 to murder the military commander Mikhail Frunze on the operation table. A myth was later created which turned Frunze into a national hero. The \"attempt\" on Lenin was immediately exploited by the party leader- ship, who stated that it was the right-wing Social Revolutionaries who had committed the terror action and that the deed had been directed at the whole working class. On the 2nd of September, Yakov Sverdlov officially demanded the beginning of a red terror campaign. He was the chairman of the Central Executive Committee (head of state) and the secretary of the Central Committee. According to official reports, the commandant of the Kremlin, Pavel Malkov, killed Fanny Kaplan illegally (without trial) on September 4, 1918. She stuck to her version that she had acted of her own accord. A political prisoner, Vasili Novikov, claimed that he had met Fanny Kaplan in the prison of Sverdlovsk in July 1932. This was officially denied just a few years ago. The prosecutor's group in Moscow did not wish to ignore this version, according to which Fanny Kaplan was pardoned at the last moment and sent to prison in Sverdlovsk in the Ural (Dagens Nyheter, 17th of March 1994). She came out in May in 1945 and died in 1947. Lenin knew that the Chekists had sabotaged the investigation of the \"attempt\" by distorting the real circumstances of such an important \"crime\" against the Bolshevik regime. He would never have accepted such a procedure unless he himself was behind the attempt. The first thing to be done after the attempt was the execution of 900 undesirable persons in Moscow. Tens of thousands were killed afterwards. On the 21st of November 1917, Lenin had said: \"We organise the violence in the name of the workers!\" The Council of People's Commissaries proclaimed the red terror as an official policy on the 5th of September 1918. This policy was never called off. A similar campaign of terror was begun after the murder of Kirov. It became one huge grisly celebration for those Jewish criminal gangs who had come into power with German and American aid and ruled the people 261"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"with their lies and unnatural doctrines. Those who were impossible to control were liquidated. Lists of such people were compiled immediately after the seizure of power but the execution machine rolled forward indiscriminately over Russia. For instance, 20 doctors were executed in Kronstadt simply because they had become too popular with the workers. That was reason enough. Death sentences were delivered for the least offence. The Chekists only needed a pretext. They wanted to murder as many people as was practically possible. Immediately after the seizure of power, Lenin had threatened his henchmen with execution if they did not follow his instructions to the letter. The abnormal circumstances in Soviet Russia brought mentally deranged people - mass murderers - to the fore. Communism became a kind of mental rabies. Even the good people shared a part of the responsibility for this process of destruction, since they did nothing to hinder the advance of that political and criminal Mafia. The Communists based their wealth and privileges on robbery. And evil was victorious. The Jewish Bolsheviks, meanwhile, declared demagogically that the Dictator- ship of the Proletariat was the highest form of democracy. The West immediately began to defend those criminals, saying that blood is always spilled for good causes... Only idiots could have been ignorant of the fact that such \"revolutions\" always involve long-term and senseless destruction. No wise and responsible person could therefore be sympathetic towards revolutions. The Jewish extremists' coups in Russia in 1917 became the greatest social catastrophe in the history of humanity. The new power-mongers stole everything from the Russian people, even their history. But the truth always comes to light in the end; mass murders cannot be concealed forever. We now know in almost every detail what happened and who the guilty parties were. Here follows a list of members of the leadership of the Cheka when the mass terror began in 1918: Felix Dzerzhinsky (chairman), Yakov Peters (Vice-Chairman and chief of the Revolutionary Tribunals), Viktor Shklovsky, Kneifis, Zeistin, Krenberg, Maria Khaikina, Sachs, Stepan Shaumyan, Seizyan, Delafabr, Blumkin, Alexandrovich, Zitkin, Zalman Ryvkin, Reintenberg, Fines, Yakov Goldin, Golperstein, Knigessen, Deibkin, Schillenckus, Yelena Rozmirovich, G.

All the Jews enumerated here became notorious. Grigori Zinoviev led the terror in Petrograd. Zinoviev was Lenin's closest comrade and secretary before the take-over, despite the fact that he was regarded as unintelligent and unskilled. His secretary Richard Pickel aided him. That he was not only a high freemason in the Grand Orient, but also a devout Jew, is apparent from the following story. The former Chekist Alexander Orlov described in his book \"The Secret History of the Stalinist Crimes\" how Zinoviev's last walk to his execution was demonstrated before Stalin. On December 20, 1936, when Stalin celebrated the anniversary of the Cheka, a grand gala was held, to which the chief of the NKVD Nikolai Yezhov, Mikhail Frinovsky (deputy chief of the NKVD), Karl Pauker (chief of the operative section) and other leading and infamous Jewish Chekists had been invited. When all were happily feasting at the table, the cruel joker Pauker decided to imitate Zinoviev's execution scene. Pauker played Zinoviev. Two of his colleagues pulled him along with them towards the cellar to be executed, \"Zinoviev\" begged for his life in a heartbreaking voice and rolled his eyes. Suddenly he fell to his knees, took hold of the warden's boot and shouted in a macabre voice: \"Dear comrade, in God's name... call on Joseph Vissarionovich!\" Stalin watched and roared with laughter. He said: \"For God's sake!\" The guests, who saw that Stalin was enjoying the show, asked Pauker to repeat his performance. Stalin could not stop laughing and clutched his stomach. Then Pauker came up with an extra scene, where \"Zinoviev\" threw up his hands and shouted: \"Hear, Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord!\" (The Jewish profession of faith, see Deuteronomy 6:4.) Then Stalin was no longer able to follow the show, since he fell to laughing so heavily that he was about to choke. He waved to Pauker to end his performance. Karl Pauker was also executed half a year later - the Hungarian Jew was accused of being a German spy. The former barber had come from Budapest to make his career in the terror-machine of Russia, despite being an uneducated and ignorant person. But Stalin had allowed himself to be shaved by him - which shows how much he trusted him. It was not always necessary to be a (preferably Jewish) Communist to become an important functionary within the Soviet apparatus. It was enough to be a Jew and also rich. Yakov Sverdlov's younger brother 263"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Venyamin had emigrated to the United States, where he had become a successful banker. Yakov, as the head of state, invited his brother to Russia soon after the take-over where he became, with Lenin's agreement, people's commissary for communications, despite the fact that he was not even a Party member. He could not cope with the demands of the job, however, and later became a leading functionary within the Soviet of the National Economy, instead (1923-25). Yakov's and Venyamin's older brother Zinovi wanted to have nothing to do with the extremists' revolutionary movement and broke away from them. His father, therefore, showered curses on him and threw him out of his home. The author Maxim Gorky (actually Alexei Peshkov) adopted Zinovi, who later emigrated to France where he became a mercenary in the Foreign Legion. His father was overjoyed to hear that Zinovi had lost his right arm in a battle. In Judaism, the cursed son always loses his right arm. Everything according to the Russian researcher Gregory Klimov. Matvei Maravnik admitted on Swedish television that he should really have become a rabbi but chose to work as a Bolshevik functionary instead. Isaac Babel fought for the red regime in Budyonny's cavalry. He took the opportunity to steal as many diamonds as he could. He was later praised for his authorship. Jewish \"revolutionaries\" believed that, by all those repulsive and terrible mass murders, they were sacrificing goy victims to please Yahweh. In the Hebrew word for 'to take prey' lies the meaning 'to plunder'. And that was precisely what they did in Russia. That was why the Jewish poet and author Heinrich Heine wrote: \"Die Judische Religion ist uberhaupt keine Religion, sie ist ein Ungluck. \" (The Jewish religion is not a religion at all, it is a calamity.) He also confirmed in his \"Confessions\" that: \"The deeds of the Jews are as little known to the world as their true nature.\" Of course, he meant the deeds of the extremists. Those criminals also worshipped Yahweh who, according to the French author Anatole France, was a mighty demon. (\"Queen Goose-Foot\", 1899.) So those Hasidic Jews had their God's blessing to enjoy the suffering and degradation of other people (Psalm 37:34). Unfortunately these people represented the worst elements of Jewry. In Europe, the Jew eventually became synonymous with the deceiver or the confidence man, according to the British Encyclopaedia. The political bandits who ravaged Russia were totally merciless and inhuman. That was the reason why 264"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Chiang Kai-shek confirmed that the greatest fault of Communism was inhumaneness. The Russian people remember with horror their Jewish executioners, all of whom had their own methods for getting rid of their enemies. Ashikin in Simferopol made his victims march stark naked before him whereupon he hacked off their arms and ears with his sword before he personally pressed out their eyes and cut off their heads. The chief executioner in Nikolaiev, Bogbender, had his victims walled in alive. Deutsch and Wichman worked in Odessa. They claimed to have no appetite until they had killed several hundred goys. The Chekists in Voronezh committed ritual murders. Among other things, they used to boil their victims alive. That was a common method of getting rid of goys and Jewish renegades. Nearly all the inhabitants of Pyatigorsk were exterminated. All this information was published in the Russian newspaper Russkoye Vosskresenye, No. 3, 1991. In Vologda, Mikhail Kedrov (Zederbaum) and Alexander Eiduk liquidated all the intellectuals, for whom they felt a particular hatred. In the winter of 1920 a 20-year-old Jew was named chief of the Cheka in Vologda. His perverse methods of execution were described by the historian Sergei Melgunov in his book \"The Red Terror in Russia\", (Moscow, 1990, p. 122). The youngster used to sit on a chair by the river. Then he had a pile of sacks and many prisoners brought to him there. The prisoners were forced into those bags and thrown down through a crack in the ice where they drowned. He was soon called to Moscow, where he was accused of being unnatural. Of course he was - after all, he had not thrown his victims into boiling water, had he? Some Jewish executioners and torturers became especially infamous, among them Roza Schulz. Arkadi Rosengoltz was especially feared among seamen and railwaymen. Among the Chek ists of Kharkov, Yakimovich, Lyubarsky, the 18-year-old youth Yesel Mankin, Feldman, Portugeis and Sayenko were particularly feared. The reserves of extremist Jews were not enough. That was why they hired a large number of Russian criminals, murderers and violent Chinese to continue the killing day and night. Jews as usual, led this mob. Many criminals had successful careers as Chekists. There were also plenty of bandits in the official Soviet organisations. Officially it was something to he proud of.

The political leader of that regiment was the Jew Feldman. Odessa's infamous robber Kotovsky was named leader of a Communist regiment. In Tsaritsyn, even soviet organs were led by (Jewish) criminals. (Sergei Melgunov, \"The Red Terror in Russia\", Moscow, 1990, pp. 178-179.) Jews usually led the Russian Chekists. Yelena Stasova and Varvara Yakovleva worked especially brutally in Petrograd. Revekka Plastina (Maizell) became infamous in Arkhangelsk, Yevgenia Bosh in Penza, and the Hungarian Jewess Remover in Odessa. The Jewess Maria Khaikina, who committed terrible atrocities, headed the Revolutionary Tribunal in Kiev. An American negro, Johnston, was sent to Odessa where he proved to be a very savage butcher. His main task was to flay victims alive (Ibid., p. 139). 266"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"It is impossible, for lack of space, to describe all the butchers and their crimes. I shall just mention some numbers. During a single year in power, the Bolsheviks exterminated 320 000 cl ergymen (Molodaya Gvardiya, No. 6, 1989). A total of 10 180 000 \"class enemies\" were murdered between 1918 and 1920. Another 15 million people died during the civil war. During the famine of 1921-22, another 5 053 000 people perished. The Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, managed to destroy over 30 million people during their first four years in power. In 1917, 143.5 million people lived in the part of Imperial Russia, which later became Soviet Russia. Russia had lost more than 20 per cent of her population by 1922. Only 131 million lived there in 1923. It has been calculated that Russia's population, under normal circumstances, should have increased to 343 million by the middle of the 1950s, that is, if the development had continued as it had begun in the Tsarist era. 165 million people disappeared. Who in the West mourns for them? There were 178 million left. The most brutal Jewish mass murderers were Roza Zemlyachka (actually Rozalia Zalkind) and Bela Kun (Aaron Kohn). The latter came from Hungary. Roza Zemlyachka was called the \"fury of the Communist terror\". Roza was born on the 1st of April 1876 and died on the 21st of January 1947. She eventually became the party secretary of the Kremlin and, in 1939, vice-chairman of the Council of People's Commissaries (that is: deputy prime minister). She was an utterly merciless and power-crazy Jewess who worked as a Chekist in the Crimea together with two other Jews, Bela Kun and Boris Feldman. Her methods of execution were so atrocious that I will spare the reader the details, which were too nasty even for Dzerzhinsky in Moscow. Bela Kun and Roza Zemlyachka were parti- cularly greedy when they went out on their forays. They managed to grab an unusually large amount of gold in Sevastopol. This was largely the basis of their enormous wealth. At the same time, they took the oppor- tunity to murder as many people as they could. It was an integrand part of Mela Kun's cruelty that he raped his female victims. This pair managed to murder 8364 people in Sevastopol during the first week of November 1920. 50 000 \"enemies of the people\" were killed in the Crimea, according to official sources (12 000 in Simferopol, 9 000 in Sevastopol, 5 000 in Yalta). The author Shmelev, however, states that at least 120 000 people were murdered in the Crimea. 267"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" Bela Kun used to lend a hand at mowing people down with machine guns. He became infamous as \"the Commissary for Death\". Dzerzhinzky called him a lunatic. Trotsky personally gave him orders to shoot 40 000 captured officers in the Crimea (Dagens Nyheter, 22nd of November 1993). The freemason Bela Kun led the Communist terror regime in Hungary. He was a Master of the Johannes Lodge in Debrecen. He was also a member of B'nai B'rith. The Masonic socialists handed the power over to him on the 20th of March 1919. There was no coup. It is worth pointing out that 90 per cent of the Hungarian freemasons were Jews. Their Council of People's Commissaries was comprised of 26 members, of which 18 were Jews. The eight Hungarians were just puppets. Bela Kun was a cunning swindler, extraordinarily greedy and cruel. He had earlier been the secretary of the Workers' Union in Kolozsvar, but was fired for embezzlement of public funds. With this in mind, it is easy to understand that his most important work consisted in hunting down goys who owned gold. Amazing amounts were transferred from Hungary to foreign banks. 268"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Hungarian Red Army began to spread Communism to Slovakia, which was eventually occupied. On June 16, 1919, the Soviet Republic of Slovakia was proclaimed and the plundering began there too. The Czech troops crushed that hellish government as early as the 7th of July and managed to frighten those greedy Jewish gangsters away. Bela Kun's and his Jewish comrades' incredibly cruel terror regime infested Hungary for 133 days. Bela Kun's Jewish commissar Isidor Bergfeld admitted that he had personally burned 60 Magyars alive in ovens and murdered another 100 with his own hands. A total of at least 560 victims were claimed. The Communist terror, which was led by the Jew Otto Korvin (actually Klein), chief of the political police, cost the country 28 billion forints in material damages and a further 14 billion in debts. It was later discovered that the \"revolutionary\" government had also stolen 900 million forints in foreign currency from the \"people's domestic fund\". (A. Melsky, \"Bela Kun and the Bolshevik Revolution in Hungary\", Stockholm, 1940, pp. 25-26, 46.) Rumanian troops deposed Bela Kun and his fellow criminals on the 6th of August 1919. Bela Kun escaped to Austria, where he was detained, but the Jewish freemason, murderer and Social Democrat Friedrich Adler secured Bela Kun's release. Bela Kun then went to Soviet Russia, where he continued with his banditry. After Adler had murdered the Austrian prime minister, Count Karl Stiirgkh, on the 22nd of October 1916, be- cause the latter had tried to prevent the activity of the left wing radicals, Adler said before the court: \"It is not only the right, but the duty, of every citizen to use violence.\" Adler was sentenced but was pardoned soon afterwards and later became the leader of the Communist Party in Austria. (In February 1934, the Social Democrats in Austria tried to seize power by force.) Several of Bela Kun's partners in crime escaped to the USA, for example Alexander Goldberger, and Joseph Pogany. Pogany was active in thc American Workers' Party under the pseudonym John Pepper. (Nesta Webster, \"The Socialist Network\", London 1926, p. 59.) Jewish Communists led by Eugene Levine and Kurt Rosenfeld also held power in Munich for two weeks (from 13th of April to 1st of May 1919). They had proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Bavaria. All its leaders were Jews who belonged to the secret Masonic lodge Number Eleven, located at 51 Brennerstrasse in Munich.

The Bolshevik bandits could ravage only those areas of Russia, which the Germans had captured for them, according to the historian Igor Bunich. The Germans were totally amazed - they had never seen anything like the cruelty they now witnessed. They could easily have put down the Bolsheviks but held back since a deal was a deal. Lieutenant Balk, the chairman of the German Commission in the province of Yaroslavl, had demanded as early as the 21st of July 1918 that the voluntary army of peasants that was fighting the Bolsheviks should capitulate to him. The 428 naive peasants did just that, following which they were handed over to the Bolsheviks who immediately executed all of them, to the Germans' horror. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 22.) The Bolsheviks were also given the Germans' lists of the opponents of Communism and on the basis of these lists they executed a further 50 247 people between March and November 1918, according to Igor Bunich. 270"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Anti-Semitism of course flared up like never before among the Russians. In all the areas, which the Whites re-conquered from the Germans, searches were made for any Jewish commissars who had not managed to escape under the Germans' protection. But there were not many left - the Whites only found a few. This was immediately exploited by the Zionist propaganda in the West, and as usual, the facts were distorted to ridiculous proportions. These myths are still, regrettably, blindly believed. I will give just one example from among all those lies. It was claimed that the Whites in the Ukrainian town of Proskurov had executed 60 000 Jews on the 15th of February 1919. That little town then only had 15 000 inhabitants, however. The Jews of Proskurov were busy introducing the Soviet regime in other areas. (Russky Kolokol, No. 7, 1929, Berlin.) There were 11 411 Jews in Proskurov in 1897 (50 per cent of the population). In 1926 there were 13 408 Jews in Proskurov (42 per cent of the population). A remarkable metamorphosis! Proskurov had 34 592 inhabitants in 1933. Encyclopaedia Judaica from 1971 states that only 1500 Jews had been killed in 1919, a figure based on Soviet propaganda. (Only nine Jewish victims can be seen on a photograph from the archives of Jerusalem.) It was now claimed that 60 000 Jews had been killed in the whole of the Ukraine. It is for my readers to decide whether they wish to believe this or not. The Zionists seem to have a weakness for big numbers connected with sixes; the same number as the points on the Star of David. The Zionist propaganda after the First World War claimed that six million Jews had died as a result of famine, epidemics and holocaust. A propaganda article entitled \"The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!\" was published in American Hebrew on the 31st of October 1919. Everything was later revealed to have been war propaganda. The most atrocious murder was committed on the night before the 17th of July 1918, when the Jew Yankel Yurovsky and his butcher's menials executed the Tsar and his family in Yekaterinburg, in the cellar of a house, which had belonged to the merchant Nikolai Ipatiev. At half past two on a hot summer night, twelve men began the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and the Tsaritsa Alexandra and their five children Olga, Maria, Tatiana, Anastasia and Alexei, and also three servants and the family doctor, Ycvgeni Botkin. One of the executioners even beat the children's dog, 271"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Jimmy, to death with the butt of his rifle. The Soviet Union's first delegation to the UN had 12 members, all Jews. The number 12 has always played a central role in the Cabbala. This number corresponds to the 12 tribes of Israel - a symbol of the struggle for world dominion. The 40-year-old Jewish Chekist Yankel Yurovsky shot Tsar Nicholas II. The Crown Prince, the sick (he suffered from haemophilia) 13-year-old boy Alexei, did not die immediately, so Yurovsky fired several more bullets into him. He had a Mauser pistol and a Colt. His grandfather was a rabbi, according to the historian Oleg Platonov. Yurovsky's schooling finished after eighteen months. He had told his brother Leiba that he dreamed of being rich. He managed to fulfil his dream through his jewellery deals. The man who held the Tsar's family imprisoned was Trotsky's favourite - Alexander Bel oborodov, one of the soviet leaders in Yekaterinburg. His real name was Yankel Weisbart and he was the son of a rich Jewish fur-trader, Isidor Weisbart. Weisbart was once caught red- handed in the act of stealing a large amount of money but nothing happened to him. Yurovsky was one of the leading Chekists in Yekaterinburg. His assistant G. Nikulin was his accomplice in the murders. The other members of the execution squad were Piotr Yermakov, Piotr Medvedyev, S. Vaganov and seven more international \"revolutionaries\", who were later presented as \"Latvians\" (a common trick to camouflage the truth, as the reader will probably have noticed). They were Andreas Vergasi, Laszlo Horvath, Victor Griinfeldt, Imre Nagy, Emile Fekete, Anselm Fischer and Isidor Edelstein. All those men were part of the special squad from the Kamyslov regiment. The entire operation was called \"Tvyordy Znak\". When all this was made public in 1992, Erzsebet Nagy, the daughter of Imre Nagy, who had led the Hungarian revolt against the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1956, reacted strongly. She tried to assert that her father had been in a prison camp at the time the Tsar and his family were murdered. He was supposed to have written a postcard to her from this camp. (Dagens Nyheter, 1 lth of September 1992.) It was hardly likely that the executioners would have been allowed to tell anyone where they were or what they were doing during a secret operation of this kind. Any former Soviet subject can confirm the truth of this. It was the Jew Schinder, chief of the Cheka's execution squad in Yekaterinburg, who selected the murderers of the Tsar and his family. The 272"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"man who destroyed the bodies with sulp huric acid was officially called Pinkus Voikov (actually Pinkhus Weiner). He was a 30-year-old Jewish chemist, who had also taken part in the preparations for the murder. He later stole a ruby ring from the finger of one of the corpses, wore it and was very proud of it. He was murdered in 1927 in Warsaw. The highest party chief of the Urals and Siberia, the 42-year-old Jew Shaya Goloshchokin, who was a close friend of Yakov Sverdlov and had never previously worked in his life, also took an active part in the planning of the murders. The historian V. Burtsev, who has investigated the revolutionary movement, described him as a degenerate type and a cruel executioner. He later led the liquidation campaign against the Kazakh people. It was he, according to the historian Oleg Platonov, who brought several strange boxes to Moscow at the end of July 1918. Those boxes, according to a discussion in Sovnarkom, contained the heads of the Tsar and his family preserved in alcohol jars. After Lenin's death, a commission found the head of Tsar Nicholas II preserved in alcohol in his filing cabinet.

He was later made one of the leaders of Comintern. Cossacks and Czech troops captured Yekaterinburg on July 25th. Nikolai Sokolov immediately began investigating the murder of the Tsar's family. He had earlier worked as a prel iminary investigator of especially important affairs for the court in Omsk. A cellar room with a grating before the window was found in the basement of the merchant Ipatiev's house. Traces of blood and bullet holes in the walls were found, despite the murderers having cleaned up after their crime. It was clear that the little cellar had been transformed into a real slaughterhouse. One of the investigators saw a quote by Heine written in German on one wall: \"Belsatzar ward in selbiger Nacht von seinen Knechten umgebracht.\" That is - (Belsa)Tsar was murdered by his slaves on the same night. In the original, the name was Belzazer. The Jewish \"historian\" Edvard Radzinsky could only say that this German quote was \"remarkable\" and did not attempt to interpret these lines. The model for Heine's text can be found in the Old Testament: \"In that night was Belshazzar the King of the Chaldeans slain.\" (Daniel 5:30.) Certain \"historians\" have tried to conceal that some cabbalistic signs were also found on the same wall. These signs were impossible to simply explain away and so Edvard Radzinsky kept quiet about them. The signs were eventually deciphered: \"The Tsar was sacrificed here, by order of the secret forces, to destroy the state. This is told to all nations.\" {Komsomolskaya Pravda, No. 169, 1989, Vilnius.) This was confirmed by the historian Sergei Naumov. This alone is evidence enough to prove that this had been a Jewish ritual murder, since this cabalistic text also indicates the Old Testament (Daniel 5:25): \"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin!\" (which, among other things means that the kingdom has been divided or destroyed). 274"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"By leafing through a little book published in Berlin just before the First World War, it becomes evident that this victim had been on the list of desiderata for a long time. The book was written by the Jew G. Fried- lander and is called \"The Romanov Dynasty in the Pillory of World History\". I will quote just one sentence: \"The Romanov dynasty must be annihilated!\" The Jewish-Russian historian Natan Eidelman also confirms that it was the Jews who murdered the Tsar and his family. (Dagens Nyheter, 10th of August 1988, p. 5.) The present archbishop of Yekaterinburg also believes that it was a ritual murder committed by Hasidic Jews. (Expressen, 24th of November 1992.) In March 1908, Lenin wrote very sympathetically about the murder of King Carlos I, and Crown Prince Louis Philip of Portugal. The reader might have guessed who were behind the murder. A bomb was thrown into the royal carriage on the 1st of February 1908. Lenin believed this crime to be \"a step in the right direction towards social revolution in that country\". He regretted that it did not lead to a general terror of the kind that renews a nation and had made the French Revolution so famous. (Lenin, \"Works\", Moscow, Vol. 12, p. 151.) Indiscriminate terror was necessary, in Lenin's opinion. But is not this what the freemasons had been working with the whole time? The freemasons murdered king Umberto I in Monza (Italy) on Yahweh Day, the 29th of July 1900. There are many other examples of similar terror attacks. Already in the 1800s, when the terrorist Sergei Nechayev suggested that the Tsar's family should be eliminated, Lenin immediately appreciated his sentiment. American extremist Jews also supported the same idea. Guile has also been used when necessary. The freemasons got rid of Manuel II, who was Carlos' youngest son, by spreading false rumours. The freemasons wanted to stop his reforms. King Manuel fled from a ball, which was held during the state visit of the Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca on October 3, 1910. Fonseca was also a freemason. The King believed in the false rumours that a revolution, which even threatened his own life, had broken out in his country. The high-ranking freemasons Theophilo Braga and Affonso da Costa were thereby able to proclaim the republic of Portugal on October 5, 1910. A provisional government chiefly consisting of freemasons came into power. Theophilo Braga named himiself president. Affonso da Costa made sure that Portugal joined the 275"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"World War in 1916. The threat presented by the freemasons had long been known in the neighbouring state of Spain. That was why all the members of different lodges were threatened with the death penalty in 1814. The Greater Soviet Encyclopaedia confirmed this in 1938. The order to murder the Tsar and his family actually came from New York. Lenin had hardly any say in the matter. The Bolsheviks had been forced to flee from Yekaterinburg in such haste that they had no time to destroy all the telegraph strips. Those strips were later found in the telegraph house. Sokolov took care of them but could not decipher the telegrams. This was done only in 1922 by a group of experts in Paris. Sokolov then discovered that the strips were extremely revealing, since they dealt with the murder of the Tsar and his family. The chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Yakov Sverdlov, sent a message to Yakov Yurovsky where he relayed that after he had told Jacob Schiff in New York about the approach of the White army, he had received orders from Schiff to liquidat e the Tsar and his entire family at once. This order was delivered to Sverdlov by the American Representa- tion, which then lay in the town of Vologda. Sverdlov ordered Yurovsky to carry out this order. But on the following day, Yurovsky wanted to check whether the order really applied to the whole family or just to the head of t he family, the Tsar. Sverdlov then told him that the entire family was to be eliminated. Yurovsky was responsible for the order being carried out. So Lenin did not decide any of this himself. The Jewish historian Edvard Radzinsky has tried to assert that it was Lenin who gave the orders to murder the Tsar and his family. But no such telegram has been found in the archives. Radzinsky's explanation that Lenin had this telegram de- stroyed does not hold water, since there is a vast amount of compromising material about Lenin otherwise. Why should he have destroyed only this particular telegram and no other equally incriminatory documents? In November 1924, Sokolov told a close friend that his publisher was afraid to print these sensitive facts in his book. They were censored out. Sokolov showed his friend the original strips and the deciphered translations. Sokolov died suddenly one month later. He was to have travelled to the United States to give evidence in favour of Henry Ford in Kuhn, Loeb & Co's lawsuit against the car magnate who had published his book \"The International Jew\". 276"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Sokolov's book \"The Murder of the Tsar's Family\" was published in Berlin in 1925 without the aforementioned information. These facts were made public only in 1939, in the exile periodical Tsarsky Vestnik. Jacob Schiff s role in those murders was described in Russia only in 1990. The Soviet authorities did not dare to publicise the killing of the Tsar's entire family in the beginning. They stated that only the Tsar had been executed. Since the murder was so hastily arranged, Trotsky never got to play prosecutor in the trial against the \"tyrant\" as he had planned. (P. Mykov, \"The Last Days of the Romanovs\", Sverdlovsk, 1926.) He said: \"The execution of the imperial family was necessary, not only to dispirit the enemy and rob him of all hope, but also to shake up our people and show them that there is no return.\" Piotr Medvedyev, chief of the guards on watch outside, has later claimed that he took no part in the murders. His wife related how he was shaking all over when he came home. He never recovered from this experience. Yakov Sverdlov's end was also a terrible one. On the 16th of March l919, he visited Morozov's factory in Moscow where a worker hit him in his head with a heavy object at around four in the afternoon. (A. Paganuzzi, \"The Truth About the Murder of the Tsar's Family\", USA, 1981, p. 133.) He officially died of tuberculosis. Sverdlov had had a strong influence ov er the Bolsheviks in Yekaterin- burg since 1905, when the Party sent him there to organise \"revolutionary\" activities (he organised robberies and murders to collect more money for the Party). The real facts about Yakov Sverdlov's death remained a state secret in the Soviet Union. Sverdlov had also stolen other people's property. Genrikh Yagoda, the people's commissary for internal affairs, had drawn up a secret document, No. 56 568, on the 27th July 1935, which stated: «Yakov Sverdlov's fireproof safe was kept in the stores of the Kremlin. The keys were missing. On the 26th of June this year, we opened the safe and found: \"1. Gold coins from the Tsarist era period amounting to 108 525 roubles. 2. Gold items, with many gems - 705 items... loan papers for 750 000 roubles were also found.\".»(Sovershenno Sekretno,No. 9, 1995, p. 16.) Jacob Schiff died quite suddenly in 1920.

Most of those involved in the murder of the Tsar were executed during the mass 277"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"terror of the 1930s (Ohtuleht, 22nd of July 1993). The rest of the execution squad fell victims to one sort of misadventure or another. The house in which the Tsar's family, their servants and doctor were murdered, was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977. He was then chief of the Party in Sverdlovsk (now once again Yekaterinburg). The Jew Markov in Perm had already executed Russia's last Tsar, Mikhail II, on June 12, 1918. The executioners who assisted him were Zhuzhgov, Myasnikov and Ivanchenko. Mikhail Romanov's body was incinerated. Nicholas had abdicated in favour of his brother, Mikhail. In this way, Russia was cleansed of all kinds of \"pests\", which was what Lenin had demanded in a decree in January 1918. Winston Churchill confirmed on the 11th of April 1919: \"Of all the tyrannies in history, the Bolshevik ty ranny is the worst, the most destruc- tive, the most degrading.\" (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", Stockholm, 1987, p. 106.) This is true. Every castle in Russia was plundered, like the funds of larger businesses, which were all confiscated at a later stage any- way. The Bolsheviks tortured people to get at their jewels. They began ruling with starvation as a weapon, just like the Cosa Nostra mafia in Sicily began ruling by exploiting the drought. All kinds of goods were sent to Berlin. In 1918 alone, 841 wagons of timber, 1218 railway carriages of mea t, two million pounds of flax, etc., were sent. The \"revolutionary\" Jews were only interested in themselves. Gleb Boky continued using Uritsky's old trick of demanding large amounts from hostages, the money finding its way into his own pocket. The GPU discovered in 1932 that Ganetsky had 60 million Swiss francs in a bank account in Geneva. (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Peters- burg, 1992, p. 42.) In October 1918, Jewish bankers in Berlin received 47 cases of gold from Russia, containing 3125 kilos of gold, 191 bars. All of this had been plundered from the Russian people, gold that later became infamous as the Jewish gold. 50 000 German marks and 300 000 Tsar-roubles were also handed over. In the autumn of 1917, the Jewish banker Mendelssohn in Berlin received 50 676 kilos of stolen Russian gold, 113 636 roubles (which was equivalent to 48 819 kilos of gold). Mendelssohn's signature in the Communist party archives is witness to the fact that he received these riches: a serious case of receiving stolen goods.

As late as l970, a Soviet functionary said openly to the director Yuri Lyubimov: \"We need neither Bulgakov nor Dostoevsky...\" (Edasi, 2nd of August l988,p. 6.) Undesirable books have also been burned in Israel. On the 23rd of March 1980 hundreds of copies of the New Testament were publicly and ceremonially burnt in Jerusalem under the auspices of Yad Le'akhim, a Jewish religious organisation subsidised by the Israeli Ministry of Religions. (Israel Shahak, \"Jewish History, Jewish Religion\", London, 1994, p. 21.) The Bolsheviks actually did everything they could to leave the remaining Russians in the ethnic sewer Marx spoke of. They wanted to crush the people's spirit and morals through total poverty and force them into crime and alcoholism. So doing, they wanted to make the workers less dangerous. They certainly succeeded. Everybody was afraid of the Communists. The Jacobins had also struck terror into their subjects to make them easier to rule. 2500 years ago the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu (490 B.C.) wrote his \"The Art of War \", where he described the most effective tactics against an enemy country in a way which is just as relevant today: \"Everything which is valuable in the enemy's country must be knocked town and destroyed... Co-operate with the worst and vilest of creatures. Provoke fights and conflicts between the citizens... Degrade the traditions of the enemy and wipe out his history. Infiltrate society with spies.\" International Communism used a technique similar to this against the Russian society. They began to eliminate traditions by re-naming 1200 Russian cities and towns and changing millions of street names. During the new generation, the Communists began to use the most effi- cient socialist means to arrest the spiritual and psychological development of society - the paths of study were closed for the talented and were only made available to the unintelligent. Had not Vladimir Lenin pointed out that they were to allow only those who sought a diploma and no knowl edge? The Swedish Socialists have also used this method \"successfully\". The Communists and Socialists know that every talented and intelligent person is against their social madness. 279"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The Jewish doctor and publicist Salomon Schulman admitted when describing the Soviet people on September 25, 1994 in Svenska Dag- bladet, that a new day was dawning; a new Jewish race had entered the world. He meant the Soviet people. Is it possible to state the case more clearly? The international financial elite decided as early as 1814, at the Vienna Congress, that Russia must be destroyed as a revenge on the Russian Tsar, who was against the plans to create the European Social Community. The Bolshevik executors believed they had justice on their side, since the God of the Jews had given them the right to exterminate all undesirable races (Deuteronomy 7:22-25). Their God has also given them the right to enslave other peaceful races (Deuteronomy 20:10-11). Karl Radek proclaimed that it was a bourgeois prejudice to act as if work led to freedom. The sensible Jewish author A. B. Jehoshua confirmed: \"For me, the catastrophe in Judaism is the idea of being the chosen people...\" (Dagens Nyheter, 3rd January 1988.) But does not Zionism build its entire ideology on the myth about \"God's chosen people\"? It is a racist ideology, even though the UN no longer considers it as such. The Bolsheviks began manipulating history precisely as it suited them in order to hide their crimes. They presented their \"history\" precisely as they wished the world to perceive it. That was why the greatest threat to Communism, which was entirely based on lies and fear, were those who bravely dared to speak the truth. Speaking the truth was regarded as anti- Soviet agitation and punished accordingly. During the Glasnost period 1986-1991, such truthfulness pierced the very \"heart\" of Communism and destroyed it. As the reader may have realised, Leninism was nothing but organised political banditry, where various Jewish groups constantly fought for power between themselves whilst other races suffered the terrible conse- quences of their madness. That power struggle was officially camouflaged as \"state anti-Semitism\". And a new myth was born. The leader of the powerful Jewish group, which defeated the others, was Lazar Kaganovich, one of the worst mass-murderers in history. 280"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"THE BLOODTHIRSTY WOLF OF THE KREMLIN LAZAR KAGANOVICH Stalin's best henchman was Lazar Kaganovich. He was born November 22, 1893 in the village of Kabany in the province of Kiev, according to Party documents. His official date of birth became the 22nd of February 1893. Lazar Kaganovich began attending a Jewish Heder school. A former shoemaker and Menshevik, he made an incredible career in Soviet Russia. He had officially worked as a cobbler previously. He had no other education. That was why he was classified as \"self-taught\" in his Party documents. He became a member of the Bolshevik Party as early as December 1911, his membership card had the number 000 008. He was regarded as an energetic functionary who was good at organising people. His written Russian displayed serious grammatical errors, according to Stalin's secretary Boris Bazhanov in his memoirs. Kaganovich's official biography claims that he was exiled to his home village in 1915, but that he escaped and concealed himself under various pseudonyms until the February revolution in 1917. His activities at that time remained a state secret, as the fact that he was a member of the Zionist movement Po'alei Zion (Workers of Zion). That organisation sought to combine Socialism with Zionism. Tens of thousands of Jewish Bolsheviks were members of Po'alei Zion. In the periodical Molodaya Gvardiya (No. 9, 1989), the Russian historian Sergei Naumov (Magadan) confirmed that Kaganovich really was a member of Po'alei Zion. Documents sent to Lazar Kaganovich, in which the emissaries of the international Zionist organisation Po'alei Zion accounted for a collection of money, have been found in the archives. Those outside the organisation were not permitted to see such reports. Leon (Leiba) Mekhlis, another notorious executioner under Stalin, was also a member of Po'alei Zion. 281"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Po'alei Zion was founded in 1899 and the Russian branch in 1901. The leaders of the organisation were then Khaim Zhitlovsky and Nakhman Syrkin (1868-1924). They took an active part in the \"revolution\" in Russia in 1905-1906, when 25 000 members of this Zionist-Marxist group fought against the Tsar. The group's World Union was founded in 1907 and the headquarters was in the Hague between 1915 and 1916, but between 1917 and 1919 it was located in Stockholm, where it received every kind of help imaginable. The headquarters then moved to the Soviet Union, where Po'alei Zion existed quite legally as the socialist Zionist party up to 1928. The members then infiltrated the Communist Party and other organi- sations. Po'alei Zion actively supported the Bolshevik seizure of power. The members of Po'alei Zion were mainly extremists and terrorists who murdered all who stood in the way of Jewish power in Russia. That subversive Marxist organisation was even represented in little Estonia. Bund - the Jewish nationalist party - and Po'alei Zion continued their activities whilst all other parties besides the Communist Party were prohibited. The Communist Party even had a Yevsektsia (that is: a Jewish section). 90 per cent of the Red Zionists belonged to the Communist repressive apparatus, according to Sergei Naumov. In 1918 the Jews Lazar Kaganovich, Genrikh Yagoda and Yan Gamar- nik deported 50 000 Russian peasants from the Kuban area. Of course, those victims were carried away in cattle wagons as usual. In 1922, Lazar Kaganovich helped Stalin become leader of the Central Committee's organisational and educational section. He was moved up into the Central Committee and the Secretariat in 1924 - Lazar Kaga- novich became the secretary of the Central Committee. After this, he took charge of the most important tasks. Between 1925 and 1928 he was the first party secretary for the Ukraine. He only had one chief- Stalin. The Jewish cultural life in the Soviet Union flowered under Kaga- novich's protection. In 1928 there were in the Soviet empire already 1075 Jewish schools, where 160 000 children were taught in Yiddish. The number of Jewish institutions increased rapidly in the years 1930-31. Three daily newspapers in Yiddish were published: Der Emess (Moscow), Oktober (Minsk) and Stern (Kharkov). Oktober wrote angrily that Russians used to say: \"Damned Jew!\" There were also many local news- papers and periodicals (Einigkeit, Heimland). A children's newspaper, Zei Gereit (Be Ready!) was also published in Kharkov. The number of books 282 "},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"and newspapers increased from 11 titles to 298 (the total edition rose trom 155 000 to 1 136 000). The publishing company Emess existed for 30 ycars. I must mention here that Jewish publications were not subject to censorship as other publications were. A Jewish cultural personality related to me that Glavlit (the censorship organ) did not censor their periodical Sovetisch Heimland. That was a sign of the Party's particular confidence. There was a department for Jewish cultural studies at the Byelorussian Academy. An institute for Jewish culture was founded in the Ukraine in 1929. Certain teachers' training colleges had special depart- ments for the education of teachers giving qualified instruction in the Jewish schools. The Jewish People's University was opened after the \"revolution\", according to Encyclopaedia Judaica. Those Jewish organi- sations, which did not suit the bandit chieftains, were closed. Lazar Kaganovich was Stalin's right-hand man in the terror-machine. There was no compassion in any part of his being, according to Robert Conquest. He believed that the interests of the Bolsheviks justified any crime. Nikita Khrushchev, who was one of his closest aides, characterised him as the \"most merciless man\". The American journalist Stuart Kahan published a very revealing book about Lazar Kaganovich. Kahan is the grandson of Kaganovich's brother Morris, who emigrated to the United States of America in the beginning of the 1900s. He spoke at length with his relative in Yiddish on the 23rd of September 1981 in Russia. The result was the book \"The Wolf of the Kremlin\" (Stockholm, 1988). Lazar Kaganovich confirmed to his relative, among other things, that it was Trotsky who led the take-over of power on the 7th-8th of November 1917. He of course idealised Lenin and Stalin and kept to the Soviet myths. He did, however, confirm the existence of secret supplementary protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Kaganovich as a Grey Eminence Lazar Kaganovich made a marvellous career after helping Stalin to silence Nadezhda Krupskaya and, through her, appropriating the wealth which Lenin had brought to Switzerland. Later he made a significant contribution to the tight against Trotsky. Krupskaya became too troublesome for Stalin 283"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"since she, Kirov and Ordzhonikidze had demanded that Stalin should be removed and be replaced by Trotsky. At a meeting of the leaders of the Central Committee, Kaganovich demanded that Krupskaya should cease all political activity, that she should never again be allowed to attend the meetings of the Central Committee and that she should keep quiet. Otherwise the Party would inform the public that Yelena Stasova had been Lenin's real wife and that Krupskaya had just been his lover. Krupskaya gave in. For that contribution, Lazar Kaganovich was promoted to a member of the Politburo and Party chief of Moscow. He had previously held the post of General Secretary of the trade unions, among others. Stalin personally explained to Krupskaya what fate awaited her if she did not transfer Lenin's fortune to Moscow. The Party could even present Roza Zemlyachka as Lenin's widow. Krupskaya gave in and revealed the locations and account numbers Stalin needed to get at Lenin's gold. At that point, Lazar Kaganovich really began to lead Stalin's cruel terror. But to become a grey eminence in the Kremlin he also needed an \"Esther\" by the side of his ruler. The opportunity presented itself when Stalin murdered his second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, in a fit of rage on November 9, 1932. Many historians do not doubt that Stalin really strangled his wife after she had accused him of genocide. Stalin was already irritated about his wife's lesbian relationship with a Jewess, Zoya Mosina, who was later jailed and sent to Siberia. Everything according to the defected Soviet diplomat Grigori Besedovsky's (actua lly Ivan Raguza's) book \"Litvinov's Memoirs\". Stalin himself actually had an inclination towards homo- sexuality, according to the Jewish Bolshevik Isaac Don Levin (\"Stalin's Big Secret\", New York, 1956, p. 40). So Stalin's second marriage (his first wife was Yekaterina Svanidze, whom he divorced in 1918) ended violently. It had begun with rape, while Stalin was on his way to Tsaritsyn in 1918 to speed up grain transports. The Bolshevik Sergei Alliluyev and his 17-year-old daughter Nadya were travelling in the same carriage. Screams were heard coming from her compartment during the night. The father demanded that the door be opened. It was finally opened and Nadya, in tears, ran out and hugged her father. She claimed that Stalin had just raped her. Sergei AUiluyev took out his revolver to shoot the offender. Stalin fell to his knees, begged forgiveness and promised to marry the girl if what had just occurred was 284"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"kept quiet. Sergei Alliluyev calmed down and agreed not to kill Stalin. That decision was to cost his daughter her life fourteen years later. As he walked in the funeral procession, he probably did not suspect that Stalin would also destroy his son. But this was what happened in 1939. Joseph Stalin (actually Dzhugashvili) was half Jewish, according to the Russian researcher Gregory Klimov. The Jew David Weissman claims he was wholly Jewish. (B'nai B'rith Messenger, 3rd of March 1950, p. 19.) The Jewish doctor and publicist, Salomon Schulman, admitted in Sweden that Stalin could speak Yiddish and referred to the Yiddish language periodical Di Goldene Kayt (1962) as his source. This was revealed during a meeting between Stalin and the Jewish poets Abraham Sutzkever and Shlomo Mikhoels (commissary for propaganda). Sutzkever discussed problems of Yiddish culture, with which Stalin was familiar. Sutzkever spoke Yiddish and Stalin understood everything but preferred to answer in Russian. The fact that Stalin understood Yiddish was one of the Soviet Union's most jealously guarded state secrets. Stalin became a fairly obedient tool of the international financial elite. Lazar Kaganovich made sure he followed all important directives. Stalin allowed no anti-Semitism at the beginning. He had an article about the most efficient ways to combat anti-Semitism published in Pravda (No. 41) in February 1929. Lazar's sister Roza became Stalin's new wife and thereby also an Esther of the Jews, following the example of the Old Testament. In 1924, a serious conflict developed between Western (Haskala) and Eastern (Hasidic) oriented Jews in Russia. The former wanted Trotsky as the chief representative of their regime, the latter preferred the half-Jew Stalin and wanted to remove as many Western Jews as possible from the corridors of power. Trotsky, however, had plans to leave Russia with the proceeds of all his plundering. Zinoviev, Kamenev and Kaganovich were at the head of the Eastern Jews at the beginning (the first two had changed sides). Stalin wished to remain in Russia and exploit the Russians and othcr peoples as the slaves of the Communist Mafia. The Stalinists wanted to get rid of as many Western Jews as possible. These criminal groups fought against each other, just like the Jacobins had fought among themselves during their reign of terror. The East-oriented Jews managed to gain the upper hand on the 21st of May 1924 and Stalin was re-elected as general secretary of the Central Committee. It was Zinoviev who most eagerly proposed Stalin for the 285"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"leadership. This support later cost him his life (in 1936), since Stalin was after Zinoviev's personal fortune. Through torture, Stalin obtained Zinoviev's account number. Many other leading Bolsheviks also handed over their riches to Stalin following torture (Kamenev, Bukharin, Unschlicht, Boky, Ganetsky, Bela Kun and others). Stalin took 60 million Swiss francs from Ganetsky alone. The Chekists tortured Bela Kun for three days before he gave in and told them where his fortune was hidden. It was that hard for him to hand over his ill-gotten gains. Officially, he was executed for the rape of many of his female victims. Only the American Jews, who had accumulated vast fortunes whilst they worked in the Soviet power apparatus, were left in peace. Trotsky was outmanoeuvred, though he managed to remain in the corridors of power. He later decided to leave Russia. He was allowed to take his extensive archive with him. Stalin had Trotsky spied upon to find out where he had hidden his wealth. At this point Lazar Kaganovich and other like-minded Jews began to play important roles in the Soviet state. To camouflage this power struggle, it was called Stalin's \"anti-Semitism\". The public did not know that Stalin's closest aides were still Jews, according to the defected secretary of the Politburo Boris Bazhanov's memoirs (he cleverly escaped to Persia on the 1st of January 1928). Even Stalin's personal secretary, Leon (Leiba) Mekhlis, was a Jew. His secretary for \"light-sensitive\" affairs was Grigori Kanner. The latter later drowned Trotsky's henchman Yefraim Shklyansky, a perfect example of a \"light-sensitive\" affair. Stalin had a total of 49 secretaries. 40 of them (80 per cent) were Jews. But those men, in turn, needed aides. Kanner employed a Jew known as Bombin to help him. Mekhlis had two Jewish helpers, Makhover and Yuzhak, according to Boris Bazhanov. Boris Bazhanov, who eventually becam e Stalin's secretary in the Politburo, confirmed in his memoirs, published in the West, that Stalin, due to his political ignorance, was not at all interested in matters of government. Those were seen to by his Jewish assistants. Bazhanov also confirmed that everything which needed to be bought abroad (for example: locomotives and other industry products) were purchased through powerful Jewish finance groups, who had a sympathetic attitude towards the Bolshevik revolution. Bazhanov also admitted that half of the members of the Central Committee were actually Jews who had quickly occupied all the leading positions. In 1939, Jews still held 38 per cent of 286"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"the posts within the Supreme Soviet. There were an incredible number of Jews at the very top of Stalin's administrative pyramid. The non-Jews in the government were just puppets. Bazhanov openly stated that the Jews held more power than the others. This openness remained until 1925, when the privileged and decisive positions of the Jews in the Soviet society began to be camouflaged. Anti-Semitism continued to grow among the people. Nikolai Bukharin said in 1927: \"We have never before had such extreme anti-Semitism as now.\" It became even worse later, despite the founding of a special bureau in the Central Committee of the Young Communists (Komsomol) for the purpose of fighting anti-Semitism. It was strange that all its decisions were slate secrets. An example of this was a resolution from the 2nd of Novem- ber 1926, where it was laid down that the primary aim of Komsomol was to combat anti-Semitism in society. That was why Stalin proclaimed on January 1st, 1931 that \"the communists resolutely condemn anti- Semitism\" and that \"in the Soviet Union, anti-Semitism is punished in the most severe manner\". It was to no avail, since the extremist Jews continued to dominate in the most important areas. Even at the universities, the leading professors and lecturers were Jews who had begun shaping the new communist generation. We can see the dreadful result of that \"educational work\" everywhere in Russia's amoral society today. There were 25 000 Jewish university lecturers in the Soviet Union in 1968, according to Isaac Deutscher. He confirmed in his book \"The Un-Jewish Jew\" that the Jews became privileged after the Bolshevik seizure of power. They had their own theatres, publishing companies and newspapers. In November 1936 the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union (the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissaries), Vyacheslav Molotov (actually Skryabin), threatened anti-Semites with the death penalty. Kaganovich knew very well that Stalin suffered from paranoia. A better tool could hardly be found. Lazar Kaganovich exploited Stalin's paranoia to the utmost and even worsened his illness in all kinds of ways so that as many Russians and Jewish competitors as possible would perish. Stalin already suffered from acute psychological problems in December 1927. He had become especially irritated over the power struggle with Leon Trotsky. That was why the Politburo wanted the world-famous neurologist Vladimir Bekhterev to examine Stalin. Even Stalin himself 287"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"wanted an examination, since his left arm had become stiff and he wanted a diagnosis. Professor Bekhterev was sent for from an ongoing congress and brought to Stalin in the Kremlin. He examined Stalin for a few hours. When he returned to the congress, he said loudly, so that everyone could hear, that he had just been consulted by a hysterical paranoiac. So Bekhterev had made his diagnosis - extreme paranoia. Bekhterev died on the following night. He was poisoned. No post-mortem was ever per- formed (Svenska Dagbladet, 22nd of November 1988; Dagens Nyheter, 25th of October 1991). Lazar Kaganovich told his American relative that it was Stalin who, on the 29th of November 1934, had planned the murder of Sergei Kirov together with Genrikh Yagoda (born in 1891 as Hirsch Yehuda), the Jewish chief of the NKVD. Kirov was killed on December 1, 1934. Leon Trotsky was officially accused of planning Kirov's murder and was even sentenced for that crime in his absence. It was Kaganovich who suggested how to get rid of undesirable competitors. For example, he suggested executing Nikolai Bukharin for acting as a lackey for the Nazis. Bukharin had earlier been called the \"golden boy of the revolution\". Kaganovich and Stalin were after his riches. Two thirds of the members of the Politburo were eventually exe- cuted through Kaganovich's intrigues. Of the 139 who in 1934 were elected members of the Central Committee, 98 were later liquidated. Nikita Khrushchev also confirmed this. Other important functionaries of the Party apparatus were also murdered, including Eismont, Tolmachev and Martemyan Ryutin (a member of Bukharin's clique). Lazar Kaganovich also made sure his relatives were given high posts within the government apparatus. His brother Mikhail Kaganovich became people's commissary for aviation affairs. Yulius Kaganovich was named party secretary in Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod). Boris Kaganovich became chief of the military uniform industry. Other relatives of Lazar Kaga- novich (Aaron Kaganovich, S. Kaganovich and others) also became important officials. (Rudolf Kommos, \"Juden hinter Stalin\" / \"Jews Behind Stalin\", Bremen, 1989, p. 158.) Historians and media in the West have asserted that there were no longer any Jews left in the administrative apparatus during Stalin's time. I got a very different impression when I checked the lists of officials and secretaries at different People's Commissariats in the years 1930-39. 288"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"People's commissaries of Jewish extraction still dominated. In 1937, 17 out of 22 people's commissaries were Jewish, despite the fact that the Communists did not want to expose the considerable Jewish element in the Soviet government apparatus. Here I can name Isidor Lyubimov (Kozelevsky), Moisei Kalmanovich, Arkadi Rosengoltz, Israel Veitzer, Yankel Gamarnik and Maxim Litvinov (actually Wallakh-Finkelstein). The Council of People's Commissaries consisted of 133 members, of whom 115 were Jews. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1937 had 27 members, of whom 17 were Jews. I shall use the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade Affairs as an example. The people's commissary was the Jew Arkadi Rosengoltz. His deputies were also Jews: Moisei Frumkin and Israel Veitzer. All the leading functionaries of the same People's Commissariat were Jews: B. Belensky, S. Bron, S. Messing, B. Plavnik, M. Bronsky, S. Dvoilatsky, L. Friedrichsohn, M. Gurevich, Y. Yanson, M. Kattel, F. Kilevets, A. Kisin, B. Krayevsky, F. Rabinovich, N. Romm, Y. Sokolin, M. Sorokin, A. Tamarin, S. Zhukovsky, Y. Flior, I. Katznelson. Only the errand boys were non-Jews. The functionaries of the other People's Commissariats were also mainly Jews. The picture was the same throughout the leading posts of the Central Committee. Even the post of general secretary was occupied by the Geor- gian half-Jew, Joseph Stalin. The other most important functionaries were the following Jews: Lazar Kaganovich, Yan Gamarnik (Chief of the Politi- cal Board of the Red Army), I. Kabakov (actually Rosenfeld), Mikhail Kaganovich, Vilhelm Knorin, Joseph Pyatnitsky (Aronsson), Mikhail Rukhimovich, M. Khatayevich, Mois ei Kalmanovich, D. Beika, Tsifri- novich, F. Gradinsky, Grigori Kaminsky, Grigori Kanner, T. Deribas, S. Schwartz, E. Veger, Leon Mekhlis, A. Steingart, Genrich Yagoda, Yona Yakir, Moisei Einstein, Yan Yakovlev (Epstein), Grigori Sokolnikov (Brilliant), Vyacheslav Polonsky (Gusin), G. Veinberg, Itzik Feffer, Samuil Agurzky, Khaim Fomin and others. These Jews played important parts in the Party apparatus: Eismont, Tolmachov, Martemyan Ryutin. There is not enough space here to name everyone and go through all the lists in this way. The picture is a clear one. The occasional non-Jews were usually married to Jewesses, like Vyacheslav Molotov (Skxyabin) who was married to Polina Zhemchuzhina (Perl Karpovskaya). She was the sister of Samuel Karp, the owner of Karp 289"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Export-Import Co. Bridgeport, Connecticut. Stalin had her imprisoned but later released her. It was all a big mistake on his part. I should like, however, to take this opportunity to name some of the most important people within the Cheka (political police), those who did Kaganovich's and Stalin's dirty work for them. The political police had 59 top leaders. Only two were non-Jewish. The leading Chekists in the 1930s were the following notorious Jews: Meier Trilisser, Yakov Agranov (Sorenson), Mark Gay, Stanislav Redens, Roman Pilyar, Abram Slutsky (murdered enemies of Communism abroad), Yakov Aleksnis, Israel Lep- levsky, Leonid Zakovsky, Zinovi Us hakov-Ushmirsky, Isaac Shapiro, Boris Berman (chief of the NKVD trial section), Lazar Kogan (was a particularly cruel interrogator), Yakov Rapoport, Joshua Sorokin, David Schuster, Mikhail Spiegelglas (vice-chief of NKVD foreign section), Moisei Gorb (led the NKVD special section), Yakov Broverman, Leonid Reikhman, Leon Elberg, Leon Scheinin, Boris Stein, Yakov Surits (who had previously been Soviet Russia's am bassador to Norway, Germany and France), Vera Inber, Alexander Langfang (uneducated executioner who became infamous as the \"hatchet\"), Vilhelm Knorin, Joseph Pyatnitsky (Aronson), Mikhail Frinovsky, Ya kov Smushkevich (who was named chief of the Air Force in 1940), Mendel Berman, Boris Rodos (totally uneducated), Leon Schwartzman, Yevgeni Hirschfeld, Sergei Efron, Zakhar Volovich (infamous executioner), Israel Pinzur, Leon Vlodzhi- minsky, Naftali Frenkel, L. Zalin, L. Meier, Z. Katznelsohn, F. Kurmin, Leonid Vul, A. Forkaister, L. Belsky (Levan), S. Gindin, V. Zaidman, J. Volfzon, G. Abrampolsky, I. Weizman, S. Rosenberg, A. Minkin, F. Katz, A. Shapiro, L. Spiegelman, M. Pater, A. Dorfman, B. Ginzburg, V. Baum- gart, J. Vodarsky, K. Goldstein, Lip sky, Ritkovsky, Berenson, Zelikman, Sofia Gertner, Yakov Mekler and many others. There were some disappointed defectors even among the higher functio- naries, the important resident of the NKVD Leiba Feldbin, who defected to the United States of America in July 1938. On May 5, 1993, Pravda published some extremely secret documents from the 13th Division of the NKVD and later from a corresponding section of the KGB, which proves that a large number of people in the Soviet Union fell victims of Jewish ritual murders. Pravda stated that \"there are still 40-50 people a year who die with traces of ritual torture\". When shall we see an end to such primitive crimes? 290"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" The Jews also played leading roles in the military Intelligence Service (GRU). Here I can mention the secret agent Leopold Trepper, whose father was a merchant in Poland. Trepper used to say proudly: \"I am a Communist, for I am a Jew!\" (Harry Rositzke, \"KGB\", Helsinki, 1984, p. 25.) Before then, he had been a Zionist activist in Palestine, but had been expelled to France, from where he moved on to Moscow. Another successful agent was Ignatz Reiss (Ignati Pretsky), whom Stalin had murdered in 1937 in Lausanne because Reiss continued to support Trotsky. This mission was given to Valter Krivitsky (born in 1899 in Poland as Schmelka Ginsburg). He was already a mass murderer at the age of 19. The extermination group under his command murdered 2341 people. In 1935 he became the chief of the Soviet military intelligence service. After 20 years as a Soviet assassin, he broke down when he was ordered to kill his Jewish friend and Communist fellow murderer Ignatz Reiss in Switzerland. Reiss had put aside a lot of money to defect to the West. Krivitsky went into hiding, whereupon another Jewish assassin, 291"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Isaac Spiegelglas, was ordered to complete the mission. Reiss was murdered on the 4th of September 1937. The French Prime Minister, the Jew Leon Blum, promised to help and protect Krivitsky. A Jewish activist, Paul Wohl, smuggled Krivitsky from France to the United States of America. Israel Don Levine on the Saturday Evening Post gave Krivitsky a contract for nine articles at $5000 each. Krivitsky was found dead in his home soon afterwards. The methods used against defectors were later changed. The defected GRU agent Viktor Suvorov described in his book \"The Aquarium\" (Yekaterinburg, 1993, pp. 4-6) how the GRU after the Second World War used to burn unsuccessful or treacherous agents alive. They were drugged and brought in diplomatic bags from the West to Moscow to be burnt to death in blast furnaces. Films of the executions were shown to new recruits so that they would have no illusions about what happened to those who failed in their missions or betrayed the organisation. One such traitor was the GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky. The British allowed the KGB to arrest him. Penkovsky admitted everything and was sentenced to death. On the 16th of May 1963, he was burnt to death before the eyes of a group of high-ranking officers. President Boris Yeltsin's secretariat admitted in 1992 that the Com- munist Party had formed a special force to carry out terrorist attacks against political opponents in the West (Svenska Dagbladet, 11th of July 1992). Comintern's best agents were also Jews. Jakob Kirchstein and Rudolf Katz were regarded as two of the best. The cultural life of the Soviet Union was \"organised\" by Kultprovsvet. The 40 leaders of that organisation were all Jews. The Soviet propaganda was of course led by a Jew - Boris Feldman. The most prominent propa- gandist journalists were also Jewish. Mikhail Koltsov (Ginzburg) was particularly efficient and also had Chekist inclinations. He directed the Communist agitation from Madrid during the Spanish Civil War. The leader of the trade unions was Solomon Dridzo (actually Lozovsky), who was later replaced with Mikhail Tomsky (Honigberg). The Young Communist organisation Komsomol was also founded and led by the Jews. The Young Communist Central Committee was first led by Oskar Ryvkin and after 1920 by Lazar Shatskin, the son of a rich Jewish businessman. (Noorte Haal, 3rd of November 1988.) This was, of 292"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"course, a state secret. Shatskin later became an enemy of Kaganovich and had to perish. Jews also led the most important sections of the Young Communist Central Committee. For example, the chief of the press section was the Jew Munka Zorky (actually Emmanuil Lifschits). The vice- chairman of the State Planning Committee in the 1930s was Leon Kritsman. One of the most important chiefs of the economy in the 1940s was Yakov Kiselman. The Destruction of Russian Culture Together with his Jewish comrades, Lazar Kaganovich organised the destruction of Russian historical and cultural heritage sites. Being a Zionist Jew, Lazar Kaganovich hated the churches. Christianity is regarded as a heresy within Judaism. Kaganovich began blowing up architecturally unique and valuable monasteries and churches in Moscow. A closer study reveals that this wave of demolition was not at all haphazard, but had a certain mad plan behind it. If straight lines are drawn between the demolished churches on a map, the resultant pattern stands out as... the Star of David. (Galina Belaya, \"Now the Jews Are Blamed for the Soviet Tragedy\", Dagens Nyheter, 2nd of January 1991.) Many small churches were converted into public toilets or museums of atheism. Such never happened to a synagogue. Kaganovich also took the opportunity to destroy several medieval forts. Only a sporadic spate of church destruction occurred during Lenin's time. There were certain diligent Russian Bolsheviks who, in their ignorance, also damaged synagogues. They later had to pay dearly for that. At two o'clock in the morning on the 5th of December 1931, Kaga- novich had the magnificent Christ the Saviour Cathedral blown up. It was built in remembrance of Russia's deliverance from Napoleon in 1812 and was finished in 1883. The cathedral was extremely richly decorated - half a ton of gold, several tons of silver, amethysts, diamonds, emeralds, turquoises, topazes, priceless icons. The chairs were set with jewels. It took 44 years to build the church and it was allowed to exist for only 48 years. Two German demolition workers refused to destroy the church. They were both executed for their resistance. The Russian engineer Zhevalkin 293"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"carried out the demolition. It only took a few months to plunder, tear apart and finally level the cathedral with the ground. Kaganovich and Stalin had the Jewish architect Boris Yofan design the Palace of the Soviets (or the Kahal Castle), which was to be built where the cathedral had stood. This building was planned to be 415 metres tall and would have amazed the world. (The Empire State Building, which was finished in 1931, was just 381 metres tall.) A 70 metre tall statue of Lenin was to top it. The plans were never realised, however. The problem with this idea was that the ground in this area, just a stone's throw from the Kremlin, was un-suitable for such a large and heavy building. Nikita Khrushchev instead had a swimming pool built there at the end of the 1950s. In 1993, the leaders of the Russian church decided to rebuild the cathedral. 294 "},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Lazar Kaganovich was put in charge of the construction of Moscow's underground (metro). He immediately began a brutal slave-labour system, where 70 000 workers were driven to extremes in three shifts. He had the Chekists capture 11-year-old boys and make them work for their lives so that the metro would be finished by the 1st of May 1935, the 159th anniversary of the Illuminati and the holy Yahweh Day. Kaganovich was knighted Cavalier of the Order of Lenin for the organisation of this pro- ject, in which many workers died. The Russian people, meanwhile, began calling him the \"Iron Commissar\". The Jewish functionaries called him the \"Great Lazar\". The underground, designed by Alexei Shchussev, was finished in time. Thc first to travel the metro were the Politburo, with the exception of Stalin who was afraid to go so deep underground. His sickness had taken a turn for the worse. The metro was given Kaganovich's name. After this, in 1935, Lazar Kaganovich was named people's commissary for communications. He immediately claimed that there were enemies of the people camouflaging themselves as railway workers. He demanded that those should be tracked down and exposed. In the archives, there are 32 letters from Kaganovich to the NKVD containing demands for the imprisonment of 83 leading functionaries within the transport system. The book \"The Wolf of the Kremlin\" also relates how Lazar forced his own brother, Mikhail Kaganovich, to commit suicide to avoid a rigged trial, where he was to be accused of spying for the Germans. His brother, as I have mentioned previously, wa s people's commissary for aviation affairs. Kaganovich later also exterminated other brothers. He declared: \"I have only one brother - Stalin!\" Kaganovich was also behind the \"five-year plan for atheism\", which began in 1932. He planned to shut the last Russian church in 1936, while God's name was supposed never to be mentioned again in the Soviet Union after 1937. The \"five year plan for atheism\" was never realised, however. Kaganovich, who administrated the atrocious terror, exploited all of Stalin's many weaknesses. Stalin's daughter Svetlana claimed in the West that her father seemed as if posse ssed by demons. He was a short man, only 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) and suffered from an inferiority complex because of this. At the same time, he suffered from his somewhat stiff and shrunken left arm. He had smallpox as a teenager and his face was still 295"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"disfigured by ugly pockmarks. Besides, he was a paranoid alcoholic psychopath. Perhaps that was why he was also so cowardly that he commanded a double of himself to be found in the spring of 1935. The secret police found a suitable man in Vinnitsa. He was called Yevsei Lubetsky. Make-up artists arranged his face so well that not even Stalin's secretary could tell the difference between him and his real master. Everyone who had been involved in the process of organising Stalin's double was eliminated. Only Kaganovich, Molotov and Malenkov knew that Stalin had a double. Comrade Lubetsky also lived in a villa. The servants in the house actually believed their master to be the real Stalin. He visited theatres, stood on top of Lenin's mausoleum, received foreign delegations... Lubetsky was arrested in 1952 but was saved by Stalin's death. He died in 1981 in the capital of Tadjikistan, Dushanbe. Up to 1929, there was hardly any sign of a Stalin cult in the Soviet Union. He visited various institutions without bodyguards to play the democrat - available to all. It was Kaganovich and Mekhlis who changed that. Towards the end of 1929, the first rose-tinted pictures of Stalin began to turn up. After that, Stalin grew into an ever greater genius. The Great Famine and Other Crimes In 1929, there was open unemployment in the cities and concealed unemployment in the countryside. The population could eat their fill in that year and the Soviet Union exported 2.5 million tons of grain. On the 9th of October 1930, Stalin officially abolished unemployment by law. The payment of unemployment benefits ceased at the same time. Kaganovich believed it necessary to reduce the population at this point. There were too many people left. The best means to get rid of them was to bring about a famine. That was why forced collectivisation was introduced in 1929. It was called \"de-kulakisation\", that is to say - the land was taken away from the land-owning farmers (k ulaks). Many smallholders were also affected, sometimes entire villages, regardless of the inhabitants' social class. On the 27th of December 1929, Stalin began using Kagano- vich's slogan: \"Liquidation of the kulaks as a class!\" Kulak ('fist' in Russian) was used to refer to a capable and wealthy farmer. Kaganovich caused the dissolution of village life in Russia. 296"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Kaganovich's most heinous crime was the organisation of the famine in 1932-33 in the Ukraine and northern Caucasia together with Yan Yakov- lev (Epstein). Lazar Kaganovich took responsibility for agriculture in the Central Committee in 1933, in order to complete this project more easily. According to the historian Vladimir Tikhonov, who is also a member of an academy, there were 26.6 million households in Russia in 1929. Five years later this figure had sunk to 23.3 million, a reduction of about three million or 11-12 per cent. Tikhonov's conclusion: over ten million people were subjected to arbitrary punishment. The farmers and peasants affected were \"the best, the most experienced and the hardest working\". It had been decided in the beginning that at least 6.8 million \"kulaks\" had to be eliminated. (\"The Socialist Build-up of the Soviet Union\", Moscow, 1934.) The \"de-kulakisation\", or collectivisation, was brought about in the following way: confiscation of houses and all property, and removal of the kulaks and their families without food in cattle wagons. These transports meant death to most of the children and the aged. Subsequently, the adults were forced into hard labour, from which most of them eventually died. In the construction of the 227 km long White Sea Canal alone, which was finished in 1933, 250 000 slave labourers died. They were forced to work at marching pace! 8 million people died as a result of the famine, according to the historian Sergei Naumov. Some of the victims were eaten (Molodaya Gvardiya, September 1989). It was an exceedingly serious crime against humanity, but those responsible fo r it were never punished. Many historians have recently reached another figure when calculating the number of fatalities. Six million died in 1933 alone. 25 000 people died every day in the Ukraine in the spring of 1933. The dead lay everywhere in the streets. Kaganovich had exported most of the grain then produced in the Ukraine whilst the population starved. About 15 million people died in connection with the collectivisation. This was genocide. The Bolsheviks, however, regarded their subjects as the property of the state. They thought thcy could do whatever they wished with them. Stalin was forced to do something about unemployment for the sake of propaganda and he made no secret of this. The foreign financiers could have ended this wholesale slaughter, but they did not. 297"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Three Jews, Lazar Kaganovich, Yakov Yakovlev (Epstein) and Grigori Kaminsky, decided how many kulaks were necessary and who should be regarded as \"kulaks\" and be driven away from their land to Siberia, to prisons and forced-labour camps. They decided to deal with the threat of the other independent peasants by forcing them into kibbutzes (milder versions of which have been tested in Palestine since 1909). The members of those kibbutzes, called kolkhozes and sovkhozes in Soviet Russia, were not given passports, since the Soviet authorities regarded these new slaves as their property. They were not allowed to move or escape from their virtually unpaid and degrading work (there was always a Politruk in every kolkhoz, who made sure that everything happened in a Communist way). Since those compulsory workers lacked domestic passports they had, in principle, no civic rights. Special permission was needed even to go shopping or trading in the nearest town. This system was only abolished in the 1970s. Trotsky, in exile, wrote in 1931 that collectivisation was a \"new era in the history of man and the beginning of the end of the idiocy in the countryside\". (Leon Trotsky, \"Problems of the Development of the USSR\", 1931.) During the time of the first Trotskyist collectivisation policy, between 1929 and 1932, not only human beings were destroyed but also 17.7 million horses, 29.8 million cattle (of which 10 million milk cows), 14.4 million pigs and 93.9 million sheep and goats. There were 19.6 million horses, just 40.7 million cattle, 11 million pigs and 32.1 million goats left in 1932. A total of 159.4 million farm animals vanished between 1929 and 1934. The author Yuri Chernichenko commented on this in the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta on the 14th of April 1988, where he said: \"It was a war, a strike against the nation's productive powers, of such magnitude that the classic horror scenes from the battle of Stalingrad seem pale and naive in comparison.\" This led to a famine in the winter of 1932-33, just as Lazar Kaganovich and his closest comrades had planned. It was forbidden to sell grain on the open market. The agricultural production was reduced by a quarter and the meat production by a half during those five years, 1929-1933, according to the historian G. Shmelev. At the same time, 1.8 million tons of grain were exported. The official Soviet slogan was very cynical: \"All for the good of the people, all is done in the name of the people's happiness!\" 298"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Kaganovich and his cronies brought about this genocide by the intro- duction of confiscatory taxation on those peasants who remained after the extermination of the \"kulaks\". Meanwhile, he sent out new gangs of fana- tical activists who commanded enforcement patrols, especially in the Ukraine, where the borders to the other Soviet republics had been closed off. The political activists took away every grain of corn and every egg, every vegetable and every fruit of the farms' produce. Convoys of trucks carried all the food away. Each piece of bread, which should have been brought to the starving, was confiscated at the border. Every Ukrainian, who might be suspected of the least, often invented, attempt at lessening the full impact of the famine or of hiding foodstuffs from the authorities, was shot or sent to the labour camps. (Robert Conquest, \"The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collektivization and the Terror-Famine\", Alberta, 1986.) Each morning, wagons drove about to collect the dead in the Ukraine and southern Russia. Bodies lined the roads in Central Asia too. Canni- balism became increasingly common in the Ukraine in 1934. Several sources show that the famine even brought forth actual slaughterhouses for orphaned children, whose meat was later sold. Victims of the famine in the Ukraine in 1933. 299"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Lazar Kaganovich and his accomplices were ultimately responsible for the deaths of nearly 15 million people during the great famine. If we add a further 15 million - the number of those who died during the collectivi- sation, we see that Kaganovich and his gang of bandits destroyed nearly 30 million human lives in just a few years. But not even that appalling mountain of victims seems to have sati sfied Stalin's or Kaganovich's thirst for blood. Therefore, in 1932, they also began the first massive wave of terror since Lenin's death. Most of those who were sent to forced-labour camps were thereby practically sentenced to death. Already in 1921, Lenin and Trotsky had built the Kholmogory death-camp near Arkhangelsk, where prisoners were slowly killed and constantly replaced. Kaganovich used the same method. It usually took just two weeks to kill the weakest prisoners. Many of the inmates in \"normal\" camps were later sentenced to death by shooting, either by special \"revoluti onary\" tribunals or by instruction from the NKVD. There were also special elimination camps, where prisoners were sent in a steady stream to be killed. I must point out here that a large number of prisoners never even reached their camps due to the immensely cruel treatment they received. For example, the Jewish administrators had worked out the following method: the train was stopped at some station where the temperature was 20 degrees below zero and everyone was commanded to undress. The prisoners were then \"showered\" with ice-cold water from hoses. The soldiers shouted: \"Lovely steam!\" (Rahva Haal, 12th of July 1989.) This terror knew no limits. When all the jigsaw pieces are finally in place, we are faced with the most horrible picture of reality I have ever heard or read about. Dante's \"Inferno\" is child's play by comparison. The Great Terror By 1937, another 18 million people besides the 30 million who had been eliminated during the collectivisation and the famine had lost their lives as a result of Kaganovich's wave of terror. It was still not enough. There were still \"too many people\" left. That was why the great terror was begun in 1937. People were executed in waves, according to the historian Dmitri Yurasov. One such wave occurred in Moscow and Leningrad on the 30th 300"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"of October 1937, when an especially large number of people were killed. Perhaps the Chekists were celebrating something? In the previous year (on the 30th of September 1936), the people's commissary for internal affairs, Genrikh Yagoda (Hirsch Yehuda) had been fired and replaced by Nikolai Yezhov. It was Kaganovich who wanted to get rid of him. He was not efficient enough. Yagoda, who had previously been a pharmacist, always carried his medicine case with him. He liked to poison his victims personally in the cells of the Lubyanka. Yagoda himself became one of the victims of the great terror. He was arrested in 1937 and shot on May 15, 1938. Yagoda had been married to Yakov Sverdlov's cousin. During this period, the NKVD was led by the dcputy chiefs Matvei Berman and Mikhail Frinovsky. Meanwhile, some of these gratuitous mass executions were directly caused by the extremist Jews' purges against other Jews. A power struggle was going on at the same time as terrible suffering was inflicted on the Russian people. The officers of the NKVD began wearing a new symbol on their sleeves during the great terror of 1934-38 - the sword and serpent. This symbolised the struggle of the c abbalistic Jews against their enemies. There is no devil according to the Talmud. Satan and God are united in Yahweh. Many leading functionaries perished in that power struggle: Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov, Pyatakov, Radek, Tomsky (Honigberg), Sokolnikov, Rykov (who became head of government after Lenin's death), Krestinsky, Bukharin... Stalin and Kaganovich were after their rivals' gold. Even Le- nin's personal bank accounts were transferred to Moscow. Everyone in- volved in that gold affair was liquidated in 1937. Stalin also wanted to lay his hands on the Social Revolutionaries' gold. They had been robbing banks in Russia and Europe for 15 years and had changed all the proceeds into gold Planned economy began to be applied also to the murdering. Kaganovich had the first extermination plan drawn up in July 1937. According to this plan the NKVD were to liquidate, during a four-month period, 268 950 people, of whom 75 950 were to be killed immediately. Kaganovich soon realised that the tempo was still too slow. Different suggestions of how the number of killings could be increased were handed in by local power-mongers to the Politburo, who accepted all these suggestions. For instance, it allowed 48 000 more people to be destroyed 301"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"and another 9200 to be imprisoned in a four-month period. But the quotas were still not satisfactory (Moskovskie Novosti, 21st of June 1992). A total of 7 million people became new political prisoners in the Soviet Union during the years 1937-38. At the peak of Stalin's and Kaganovich's terror, the number of executions reached 40 000 per month, according to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who estimated the total figure of those executed in the years 1937-38 at one million and assessed that another two million died in the work camps. Literaturnaya Rossiya published the largest estimate of the total number of victims of the Soviet regime, including those who died of induced starvation and maltreatment - 147 million. This came to nearly 5 million per year for 30 years, though the years 1937- 38 accounted for a disproportionate amount of deaths. I must point out here that many of those murdered were women and children who had been classed as \"enemies of the people\". The systematic killing of large numbers of children began as early as 1934. After all, they cost money... In Moscow, the murders were carried out in the prison dungeons of the Lubyanka, the Butyrka and the Lefortovo. Stalin and Kaganovich had their most famous victims cremated at night, following which they had the ash smuggled out and buried in a mass grave in the Donskoye graveyard. This seemed the safest way to complete the total elimination of their important victims. Far from all of those killed in the jails of Moscow during the 1930s, the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s were cremated. Most of them were thrown into various mass graves in Moscow. One of those hitherto un- known mass graves was found in the Kalitinsky graveyard in southern Moscow. The NKVD used it as a dumping site for bodies for several years in the 1930s. The covered lorries arrived at around five in the afternoon, every single day for seven years between 1934 an 1941. They drove up to the far end of a ravine, turned around and reversed up to the edge. The trucks were painted blue-green and lacked side-windows. Instead, large letters on the sides of the truck announced SAUSAGES or MEAT and sometimes CAKES. When the truck had backed up to the edge and stopped, a hatch was opened at the back and two officers wearing NKVD uniforms, rubber boots, long rubber aprons in black and gold and elbow-length rubber gloves seized the corpses by the heads and legs and threw them down into the ravine. Two other soldiers waited down below with shovels and threw 302"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"some earth on the bodies. The corpses were always naked. They all had bullet holes in their heads; a small entry hole in the back of the neck and large exit hole in front. They had been shot from behind. The executioners had an unlimited supply of alcohol. They were usually drunk, sometimes extremely. Vodka was consumed during and after work. The KGB admitted in July 1990 that there were also mass graves in the Donskoye and Vagankovskoye cemeteries in Moscow. A large execution site has now been found in Kuropaty, six miles from Minsk, the capital of Byelorussia. At least 102 000 people were murdered there, including many women. Witne sses have related that the executions began in the evenings and continued through the nights. The executioners wore NKVD uniforms. The witness Mikolai Karpovich saw how people stood lined up by a mass grave. They were gagged and blindfolded. To save bullets, the executioners usually tried to shoot two people with each shot. Executions took place there every day between 1937 and June 1941. Thc people who lived near the Kuropaty forest could hear salvoes of shots and prisoners begging and screaming for their lives. There were at least five such execution sites around Minsk, where the butchers worked in shifts. Uniformed NKVD men used to take part in the dance in the village of Kuropaty at around 11 o'clock on Saturday evenings. (Expressen, 18th of October 1988.) About fifty mass graves in this area have later been opened. Prisoners who were taken to Kuropaty in the winter were forced to step out of the carriages in the severe cold, whereupon they were showered in icy water and ordered to return to the carriages. Not many survived until the following morning. The heads were cut off from all the frozen corpses. The survivors were killed at the edge of the mass grave, into which all the victims were thrown. Moscow Television related on the 12th of September 1989 that nearly 300 000 victims had been found in an abandoned goldmine near Chel- yabinsk. This was the largest mass grave. The Communists killed up to 250 000 \"enemies of the people\" in the forest of Bykovnya near Kiev between 1937 and 1941. Most were shot in the neck, but a few had also been poisoned by smoke (Dagens Nyheter, 25th of March 1989). That place had earlier been called the grave of the victims of fascism. The bodies of many Jews were supposed to have been hidden there, but this lie was exposed after the fall of Communism. 303"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" Boris Berman inspects the prisoners' work by the White Sea Canal. When the terror reached its peak in 1937, the NKVD men could not keep up with their task only by shooting the victims, so they began gassing them to death in lorries. (Dagens Nyheter, 17th of June 1991, A 9.) It becomes understandable in the light of this information that all honest, decent people paled at the very mention of the NKVD. People were also gassed to death during Lenin's time. The NKVD had built up an efficient information system where those who informed on an \"enemy of the people\" received a large amount of money from NKVD commissars in leather jackets. The West considered all of this to be quite normal. The American am-' bassador in Moscow, Joseph Davies (a freemason), was especially enthusiastic about the mock trials. He reported to the secretary of state that the material proved \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that the sentences for treason were justified. He praised the Soviet system of justice to such an extent in the press and in diplomatic dispatches that he was awarded the Order of Lenin. (Svenska Dagbladet, 7th of October 1990, \"The Stalinist Purges Are Rc- 304"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Examined\".) Revelations about the real situation were regarded as libel by the American press. Western observers were also quite happy with the Jewish Chief Prose- cutor Andrei Vyshinsky, who used to begin his appeals with the phrase: \"Shoot the mad dogs!\" The Danish Communist author Martin Andersen- Nexo wrote about Vyshinsky: \"The prosecutor's appeal was highly con- vincing and the sentence absolutely just!\" The British author George Bernard Shaw dismissed the bestial behaviour of the Bolsheviks by saying that primitive Russia needed to be subjected to force from above. He claimed that certain nations had the right to exterminate so-called undesirable elements among the people. He even recommended Stalin for the Nobel Peace Prize after a visit to Russia in 1931 (Svenska Dagbladet, 13th of September 1991). Stalin felt no compassion, even for his own comrades, least of all when he felt threatened. People's commissary Grigori (Sergo) Ordzhonikidze demanded an end to the mass terror on the 16th of February 1937. Ordzhonikidze said: \"You are insane. Now I know that...\" On the 18th of February, Stalin sent Chekists to his home. They informed him that he had the choice of shooting himself or dying in the NKVD basement. Ordzhonikidze had no way out. He officially committed suicide and Stalin publicly cried over his death. Stalin was a good actor. (Abdurakhman Avtrokhanov, \"The Technology of Power\", Frankfurt am Main, 1976, p. 422.) Raskolnikov, another naive old Bolshevik, protested. He remained abroad and sent a letter to the general secretary: \"You should be put on trial, Comrade Stalin, as an instigator of famine, a vandal, traitor to the revolution and as the executioner of the intelligentsia, the army and of science!\" Stalin continued with his \"perestroika\". Nikolai Yezhov, meanwhile, became ever more troublesome. He was known as an alcoholic and also used other drugs. When Stalin had to choose a new chief of the terror, he had a choice between Yezhov and Beria. He chose Yezhov, who had impressed him by hitting Sokolnikov (Brilliant) in his face at a meeting of the Central Committee. This, Yezhov's argument, won Stalin's appre- ciation. Yezhov was promoted to be Stalin's closest aide. Yezhov felt threatcned by Lavrenti Beria, so he began, as chief of the NKVD, to collect compromising information about the latter. He also tried to 305"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"outmanoeuvre Kaganovich. Beria heard about this through the grapevine and immediately flew to Moscow to report everything to Stalin. Stalin ordered an investigation into the matter. The investigatory commission reached the conclusion that there were, according to Yezhov, only two honest Communists left in the leadership of the party - Stalin and Molotov, apart from Yezhov himself, of course. Yezhov was fired in July 1938 and instead became chief of water transport. For his contributions to the uncovering of an anti-Stalinist plot, the Jew Lavrenti Beria (his mother was a Jewess) was named people's commissary for internal affairs and later also became chief of the NKVD. Marshal Georgi Zhukov called him a \"monstrous person\". This was certainly true, and now he became Stalin's and Kaganovich's best henchman. Beria's Contribution Stalin became extremely interested in the UFO phenomenon. Beria was asked to collect information about that enigma. Stalin was also interested in other mysterious subjects. He was very pleased when, before the Second World War, Hitler's Jewish astrologer and seer Wolf Messing came over to Russia and helped Stalin in every way. He was even able to predict that Hitler would be defeated in May 1945. Stalin began to trust Beria, since Beria had saved him from an attempt on his life by lake Ritsa in Abkhazia. Stalin and Kaganovich had Yezhov executed through Beria on the 1st of April 1940, by way of an April fool's joke. Yezhov had \"punished citizens without reason\". (Everything accor- ding to the periodical Ogonyok, February 1988.) The first thing Lavrenti Beria did was to soften the regime in the prison camps. The torture ceased. At the same time, he immediately began executing the old Chekists. He wanted new men who would compete with each other in trying to imprison or execute as many people as possible. General Leonid Reikhman became one of his most important Chekists. Beria hated children. For that reason he wanted as many children as possible sent into heavy slave labour. In October 1940 his Chekists managed to imprison up to a million children between 14 and 17 years of age. NKVD units had kidnapped those children in various Russian cities and immediately herded them like cattle to prison camps where most of 306"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"them died from starvation and exhaustion. From 1943, the Chekists managed to collect two million children per year. Bcria became a dreadful executioner during the Second World War, since he was able to conceal his crimes as the work of the Nazis. He had nearly 20 million people captured and sent to slave camps. According to the latest estimates, the Soviet Union lost at least 32 million, possibly 45 million, citizens during the Second World War. The historian Nikolai Tolstoy claims that most of them (presumably 20 million) were killed by order of Lavrenti Beria. All those deaths were blamed on the Germans. During the war, Beria had founded a fearsome terror organization, Smersh (\"Death to the spies!\"), which murdered a vast number of people. Those executioners were so proud of their work that they had themselves filmed while in action. The director Stanislav Govorukhin showed a few such film sequences in his \"The Russia We Lost\", where Smersh hanged \"enemies of the people\" and cheerfully applauded their crime. Many people ended up in special camps called ChSIR. Those were intended for the families of traitors to the fatherland. All prisoners of war were also regarded as traitors. Millions were captured in thc years 1941-42. Many of them starved to death since Lazar Kaganovich and Lavrenti Beria, in Stalin's name, forbade the Red Cross to bring the prisoners food. Oddly enough, the Red Cross complied, and still more people died. Stalin, Kaganovich and Beria took care to destroy all the food stores before the German siege of Leningrad - they wanted to destroy all the awkward witnesses to the historic events in that city. Ludmila Grunberg, who lived in Leningrad at the time, confirmed this. Beria was made marshal of the Soviet Union for his cruel terror during the war. Semyon Ignatiev was named the new chief of the NKVD. Beria was made chairman of the Atomic Commission in 1946. He still held a lot of power as the people's commissary for internal affairs and continued his terror campaign also after the war. He proved himself to be a thousand times worse than Yagoda and Yezhov together. During the campaigns against \"counter-revolutionaries and for the realisation of the land reform 1949-52\" at least five million people, according to conservative estimates, were executed. (Svenska Dagbladet, 27 th November 1988.) Kaganovich and Beria were responsible for those mass murders. 307"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The history of the Second World War has also begun to be revised in Russia now. The defected Russian intelligence officer Viktor Suvorov (Vladimir Rezun) revealed in his books \"The Ice-Breaker\" (Moscow, 1992) and \"M Day\" (Moscow, 1994) that it was actually Stalin who planned to attack Hitler, and Germany was therefore forced to a pre- emptive attack. During the last weeks of the war, the Jewish journalist Ilya Ehrenburg encouraged the Soviet soldiers to rape the enemy's women in hundreds of pressreleases. \"Kill them! Nobody in Ge rmany is innocent. Neither the living nor the unborn. Heed the words of comrade Stalin and crush the Fascist beast in its cave! Break down the racial pride of the German woman! Take her as your legitimate spoils of war! Kill them, you brave soldiers of the victorious Red Army!\" His exhortation was followed. The Red Army, according to TV Rapport (Sweden, 8th of January 1994), raped two million German women (180 000 died as a result). Gang rapes of German women took place. 300 000 children, many of whom died from malnutrition, were born as a result. Lavrenti Beria constantly abused his power, forcing women who took his fancy to sleep with him. Police cars were used to kidnap pretty girls who were brought to Beria. He raped them, following which they were | shot and buried in the garden of his little private palace. Skeletons of 308 "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"young women were found in this garden in March 1993. {Dagens Nyheter, 6th of April 1993.) Beria also kidnapped, sexually exploited and killed young boys. Ordzhonikidze had warned Stalin about the fact that Beria had been the agent of the Musavatists in Baku between 1918 and 1920. The British controlled the Musavatists' intelligence. In 1919 Beria began working for the British. Stalin did not care about those accusations, since Beria had later become a double agent for the NKVD. Instead, everyone who dared mention this subject vanished mysteriously. That was why Grigori Kaminsky, people's commissary for public health, was executed. Some historians assert that Beria was Stalin's homosexual lover. Stalin had also been an agent of the tsarist police, the Okhrana, after he had lost his job as assistant meteorologist in Tiflis (now Tbilisi). Stalin had written many reports to the Okhrana's chief, Vissarionov. In 1906 he was arrested together with other Bolsheviks, but was released a few hours later. But when Stalin wanted to get rid of his fellow agent Roman Malinowski, he was sent to Siberia. Malinowski was lured to Soviet Russia in November 1918, where he was executed by order of Lenin. Stalin, Kaganovich and Beria had 25 700 Polish citizens executed in April 1940. The murder of more than 4000 Polish officers (including many of Jewish blood) in Katyn wa s brought to light by the Germans. It was Ivan Krivozhertsev who informed the Germans about the mass graves in the Katyn forest. No one wanted to listen to the Nazis' claim that it had been the work of the Bolsheviks, since the Soviet Union had blamed the Germans. It was only on the 14th of October 1992 that a copy of the decision signed by Stalin and passed by Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin and others, was handed over to the Polish President Lech Walesa by the Russian government. It was not really so strange that Jewish Chekists had also executed Jewish officers (including Abram Engel, Samuel Rosen, Isaak Gutman, Isaak Feinkel and others) who had served in the Polish army. After all, the Old Testament states that Yahweh is equally merciless against his own chosen people (Joshua 24:19). They were regarded as traitors! The President of the United States of America Franklin Delano Roose- velt, and the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, prohibited all publicity about this mass murder. Roosevelt officially asserted that the events in 309"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Katyn were a German plot. Winston Churchill warned his ministers: \"The whole subject must be avoided!\" At the same time, he assured Stalin that he would do all he could to silence the Polish exile newspapers in London. Voice of America was not, even in the 1970s, allowed to relate that the Bolsheviks had killed the Polish officers. Hans Holzapfel, the Jewish chief of the European section, was responsible for the censorship. It is now known exactly what happened. The mass murders began in April 1940. The Polish officers, wearing winter uniforms, were brought in small groups - 30-40 at a time - to the execution site. They were then shot in the neck, one at a time, whilst standing by the edge of the mass grave. The NKVD continued working every day for nearly six weeks. A total of 4143 officer's bodies were found. 4421 people were killed in the Katyn forest, according to the documents. All the identified bodies proved to be former prisoners from Kozielsk. The prisoners who had been incarcerated in the Starobielsk (near Kharkov) and Ostashkov (near Kalinin) camps were murdered elsewhere. The latter amounted to 10 131 (3820 + 6311) people. Another 7305 Polish citizens were murdered in Byelorussia and the Ukraine. The pertaining documents were marked: \"Must never be opened!\" Kaganovich founded actual slave camps, where the inmates worked in chains. Of the most important Jewish camp commanders (Aaron Soltz, Naftali Frenkel - a Turkish Jew -, Yakov Berman, Sergei Zhuk, Yakov Rapoport, Nakhimson, Yakov Moroz, Abramson, Pliner, Matvei Berman, Samuil Kogan, Samuil Firin, Biskon, Finkelstein, Serpukhovsky). Lazar Kogan was picked out as insufficiently effective. He was executed in 1938 and replaced by another Jew. Kaganovich made an important contribution to the founding of the state of Israel. Moscow stated in the beginning of May 1947 that Palestine should be divided into an Arabic and a Jewish state. Meanwhile, Zionist Jews marched into Palestine singing the \"Internationale\". At a later point, the perfect astrological time for the birth of the new state was worked out. Astrologically, it would favour both the leadership and the subjects. Therefore, the state of Israel was proclaimed on May 14, 1948 at 4:37 in the afternoon. The UN General Assemb ly, however, had already made the decision giving this project the green light, on the 29th of September 1947. The Zionists, led by the first president of Israel, Chaim Weizman (who came from Poland), knew that the best available weapons came from 310"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Czechoslovakia, but the right-wing government of that country refused to sell anything to the Jews. So Stalin organised a Communist coup in Prague (led by Klement Gottwald) in February 1948 and in the summer of 1948, half a year after the coup, Western European (including Swedish) airmen began secretly smuggling goods from Communist Czechoslovakia to the new state of Israel. It was David Ben-Gurion who took the initiative for the weapons deals. Stalin and Kaganovich had seen to it that all those weapon deliveries were effected by an American airline company . American instructors in a secret camp outside Prague trained Israeli pilots. (Dagens Nyheter, 23rd of December 1990, \"Svenskar hjalpte Stalin\" / \"Swedes Helped Stalin\" by Andcrs Persson.) All those weapons were produced in 1944-45 for Hitler's Nazi Germany and were intended for anti-British Arabs. The ammunition later used against the Arabs was marked both with swastikas and with Arabic letters. Even Issaac Deutscher admitted that Stalin sent both financial and efficient material aid to the Jews in Palestine. (\"The Un-Jewish Jew\", Stockholm, 1969, p.99. ) Stalin began fighting against the Zionist leaders in 1949. His psycho- logical disturbances had become worse. That was the reason why he began the campaign against the \"Cosmopolites\" in November. He thought it was time to begin persecuting the Jews and reviling the Zionists. Stalin had the Jewish author Samuil Persov arrested on the 18th of January 1949 and executed on the 23rd of November 1950. Samuil Gordon met the same fate when he was executed on the 21st of July 1951. Stalin began persecuting all kinds of Jewish cultural workers in August 1952. On the 12th of August 1952, 24 Jewish cultural workers (including Yiddish language authors) were arrested and 23 of them were executed. On the same evening, another 217 Jewish poets and prosaists, 108 actors, 87 artists and 19 musicians also vanished without trace. The authors David Bergelson, Fefer Itsik and David Hofstein were among those murdered. Then Stalin began cleaning out the Jewish elements from the government apparatus, not just in the Soviet Union but also in its satellite states. The Prague trial against Rudolf Slanski (actually Salzmann), Vlado Clementi and others was much discussed. 311"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"The Murder of Stalin The leading Jews became extremely worried and began to take counter- measures. They managed to fire Joseph Stalin from the post of general secretary in October 1952. (\"The Encyclopaedic Reference Book\", Moscow, 1955, Vol. 3, p. 310.) This fact has been left out of all of Stalin biographies. The public at large has never heard anything about this Jewish revenge. Georgi Malenkov was chosen to fill the post of first secretary of the Central Committee. There is no information about this in later encyclopaedias. Stalin was relegated to an ordinary secretary within the Central Committee. He also retained the post of prime minister. Stalin became deeply concerned and responded with counter-measures. Thus, he ordered a group of Jewish doctors (Professor Boris Kogan, Professor J. Rapoport, A. Feldman, Miron Vovsy, A. Grinstein, Y. Etinger and others) to be arrested on November 7, 1952. They were accused of! causing the deaths of two Russian members of the Politburo (Andrei Zhdanov - the chief of Cominform - and Alexander Shcherbakov). In the case of Zhdanov, those doctors supposedly made a false diagnosis and kept the symptoms of his heart-condition secret. On the 1st of September 1948, Izvestiya had related that Andrei Zhdanov had died in the hospital. Now Stalin asserted that his Jewish doctors had contributed to his death. Stalin also accused them of planning to kill some other Russian members of the Politburo and that they received their instructions from the Zionist organisation the Joint Distribution Committee, everything according to professor Vovsy's confessions. (Abdurakhman Avtrokhanov, \"The Mystery of Stalin's Death\", Frankfurt am Main, 1981, p. 182.) We may presume that this was one of Stalin's invented accusations. When Stalin accused Trotsky of being a German spy, everyone thought he was lying. Documents found in Wester n archives have now confirmed that Stalin was right. The Joint Distribution Committee is an international Zionist organi- sation, founded in 1914, which works with large-scale economic and propaganda activities in the interests of Jewry. The central leadership of the organisation has its headquarters in New York. Paul Warburg was among the leaders. The Joint Distribution Committee has hidden represen- tatives in nearly all countries. 312"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" The organisation was officially active in the Soviet Union up to 1938. The chairman of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee was once the Illuminatus Felix Warburg, according to the Encyclopaedia Judaica. This was the subversive organisation Joseph Stalin accused the doctors of working for. Beria responded with an intrigue to remove Stalin's Russian doctor, professor Vladimir Vinogradov. He reported to Stalin that Vinogradov had recommcnded that he (Stalin) should refrain from all activity for reasons of health. Stalin was furious and shouted: \"Put him in irons!\" Stalin continued to rid himself of Jewish aides as fast as he could. Leon Mekhlis, whom Stalin had made editor-in-chief of Pravda, was among the victims. Stalin suspected Mekhlis of having something in common with the arrested Jewish doctors and for this reason sent him to Saratov, where he was quietly seized and brought back to Moscow to be murdered. He witnessed against the imprisoned Jewish doctors in the hospital of the Lefortovo jail. Mekhlis died on the 13th of February 1953. He was buried in Red Square, but this time Stalin was not there to shed crocodile tears for him.

It was also apparent from this article that Stalin's next aim was to purge the Politburo of Jews and other members with Jewish relatives (wives). There were two Jews (Kaganovich and Beria) left among the eleven members of the Politburo at that point, as well as five Russian members with Jewish relatives (Molotov, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Andreyev, Voroshilov), according to the historian Abdu- rakhman Avtrokhanov. Stalin wanted to form a new, larger Politburo with Russian members. The leading Jews began worrying about their positions. They realised that Stalin could go much further. One of those concerned was Lazar Kaganovich, member of the Politburo. He decided to organise a plot to have Stalin removed. He invited three other members of the Politburo; Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov and Kliment Voroshilov, to Voroshilov's villa in Zhukovka where he, according to his own admission, suggested using his own sister Roza (Stalin's wife), who was a doctor, to kill Stalin by means of tablets which caused cerebral haemorrhage. It was decided that Stalin's usual tablets should be exchanged for some others, which Molotov called rat-poison. Everybody approved of Kaganovich's suggestion. (Stuart Kahan, \"The Wolf of the Kremlin: Stalin's Right-Hand Man\", Stockholm, 1988, pp. 268-269.) Beria also felt threatened and worked out his own plan, which he called Mozart. Beria got Nikita Khrushchev, Georgi Malenkov and Nikolai Bul- ganin over to his side. Everybody waited for the right moment. Stalin suspected that something was going on. He realised that he was no longer useful to the Jews. He therefore said to the presidium at the end of February that the main proceedings against the Jewish doctors would take place in the middle of March. At the same time, he took the opportunity to present a proposal for a new decree, according to which all Jews were to be deported to Central Asia. Kaganovich and Molotov protested. Stalin did not care about the consequences. He had had enough of the Jews.

At Stalin's stately home in Kuntsevo (formerly Orlov's estate), 84 km from Moscow, his bodyguards, Piotr Lozgachev and Mikhail Stratostin, became suspicious on the evening of March 1, 1953, since they had not heard from Stalin all day. They were both afraid to go in to him on their own authority. Lozgachev finally plucked up courage to open the door. He found Stalin stretched out on the floor by the dining table, with one elbow propped awkwardly against the carpet. Beside him lay a pocket watch and a copy of Pravda. He was conscious, but had lost the power of speech. Stratostin immediately informed Georgi Malenkov, the Party's general secretary, who asked him to call Beria too. Beria did not want anyone else to know about Stalin's illness. He turned up at three o'clock in the mor- ning together with Malenkov. They brought no doctor. They listened to Stalin's loud snoring for a while. Then Beria turned to Lozgachev and said in a menacing voice: \"Are you trying to cause panic, eh? Don't you see that comrade Stalin is fast asleep?\" Nikita Khrushchev came along only at 7:30 on the morning of the 2nd of March and only after that did the first doctors appear. Beria had made sure that Stalin received no medical aid for the first 12-13 hours since the discovery of his illness. Stalin died three days later, on the 5th of March. Beria was named people's commissary for internal affairs for his contri- bution to Stalin's demise. At the same time, everything was done to re- cstablish Jewish rule. Stalin had really tried his best to get rid of the extremist Jews as soon as he began to mistrust them. For instance, Piotr Pospelov (actually Fogelson) had worked as the chief ideologist of the Communist Party between 1940 and 1949. Stalin had Pospelov discharged and made him director of the Institute for Marx, Engels and Stalin Studies. He was also fired from this post in 1952. Beria released the Jewish cultural workers and doctors who had been imprisoned as quickly as possible. M. Ryumin and other Chekists, who were involved in the preliminary investigation against the leading Jewish doctors, were executed in 1954. Professor B. Kogan had himself been an important Bolshevik leader, who enforced the Soviet regime in Volynia in 1954.

He forced Georgi Malenkov to resign as head of the Party on March 14th. (Malenkov died in Moscow in January 1988 at 86 years of age.) Nikita Khrushchev was named deputy general secretary. The Communist Party lacked an official leader until September 1953, when a meeting of the Central Committee officially confirm ed Khrushchev's position as Party leader. It was Kaganovich and Molotov who helped Khrushchev to get rid of Malenkov. It must be stated here that this period was not at all as chaotic as Khrushchev later maintained. The hitherto secret documents are explicit in that respect. The professor of history Boris Starkov presented these documents in his article \"100 Days of the Marshal of the Lubyanka or Was Lavrenti Beria a Reformer?\" (The newspaper Fontanka in St. Petersburg, November 9, 1993.) On the 23rd of March, Beria issued a decree, which released over a million political prisoners. He had plans to reform the GULAG system. On the 16th of June 1953, he proposed that the forced labour system should be abolished since it was ineffective and lacked perspective. He also proposed that all the cases where people had been tried for counter- revolutionary activity should be reviewed. He recommended that all those people should be rehabilitated and that damages should be paid to the innocent victims. He even wanted the deportees released. It was Beria who revoked all the charges against the Jewish doctors. Lavrenti Beria went even further. He prohibited all Communist slogans before the parade at the victory celebration on the 9th of May 1953. On the 27th of May, he proposed halting the development of Socialism in East Germany and allowing Germany to reunite on a bourgeois basis. For the Soviet Union, however, he held some unacceptable plans. Beria wanted to sell the Baltic states to the Western powers. A KGB agent, Georg Meri (the father of Estonia's former president, Lennart Meri), was to become prime minister of the independent democracy of Estonia. It was Khrushchev who first spoke of Beria's plans to give away the Baltic countries. On the 12th of June 1953, Beria gave orders for the Russians in the Baltic republics to return to Russia and allow the local authorities to assume power. This order was immediately acted upon. 316"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Beria was the first to begin abolishing the Stalin cult. It was strange, meanwhile, to discover Kaganovich's signature on so many proposals for change. Beria later began encouraging Khrushchev and Bulganin to seize power officially but these, together with Malenkov, decided to halt Beria's reforms, which had frightened the Party apparatus to death. They wanted to have him arrested. Marshal Georgi Zhukov led the operation to arrest Beria at the meeting of the Politburo on the 27th of June 1953. The trial of Beria and his six closest men was held between the 18th and the 23rd of December 1953. They were all sentenced to death and executed on the day the sentence was pronounced - the 23rd of December. Kaganovich helped liquidate Beria. He had hoped to gain the real power himself and was very disappointed when Nikita Khrushchev was elected the new leader of the Communist Party in September 1953. Nikita had earlier been his pupil and subordinate. He had been a simple miner with hardly any education when he met Kaganovich. But he was married to the Jewess Nina Gorskaya. Khrushchev had Stalin's son Vasili arrested on the 28th April 1953, since he had openly accused the Politburo of his father's murder. Vasili was sentenced to eight years' hard labour. His false accusation of Marshal Alexander Novikov was used as a pretext for the sentence. He was soon released, however, and pensioned off. Vasili was found dead in his bed half a year later. In 1953, there were 12 million prisoners in the camps and 8 million sol- diers in the army (who had an even harder life) as well as 30 million pea- sants working for virtually nothing in the kolkhozes and 40 million wor- king under the same conditions in the industry, according to Vladimir Soloukhin. Kaganovich decided to wait for a suitable opportunity to depose Khruschev and seize power for himself. In 1957 he tried to bring about a coup together with Malenkov, Molotov and some other conspirators, but it was Khrushchev who succeeded in crushing Kaganovich and his group. Khrushchev exposed Kaganovich completely at a Party meeting in June 1957. He told the Party leadership that Kaganovich had ordered an in- credible number of leading Party functionaries and civil servants destroyed on false grounds. Khrushchev also presented evidence - Kaganovich's written orders to courts, his proposals to the NKVD, and telegrams to Stalin containing libellous statements. Finally, Khrushchev 317"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"accused Kaganovich of the intentional murder of at least 20 million Soviet citizens. Kaganovich telephoned Khrushchev to beg for mercy. He did not want to be executed. Khrushchev answered: \"But what did you want done to me?\" As punishment, the Party leader sent the 64-year-old Kaganovich to the Urals, where he became the director of an asbestos factory in the town of Asbest. Molotov was sent as ambassador to Mongolia. Eight towns, which had been given Kaganovich's name, including Kaganovichibad and Kaganovichesk, were given back their old names. The metro in Moscow was instead named after Lenin. The top functionaries had reached an agreement to stop killing each other. There was one crime, however, which Khrushchev hushed up entirely, since he himself had been involved in it. In 1946 some problems arose with the Ukrainians, who stubbornly continued their passive resistance. Khrushchev, who had been the Party's first secretary in the Ukraine, had great difficulty, despite receiving instructions from Stalin, in breaking the Ukrainians' resistance with an artificial famine. He failed in this mission. This was why Stalin had him temporarily deposed, and sent in Kaganovich as the Party's first man in the Ukraine. Kaganovich was (as always) so efficient that two million people died in the new famine. The Ukrainians' resistance broke. Stalin was pleased. That awful crime was silenced in the West and when it eventually came out, the Western press did not want to admit that it had been the work of Kaganovich. They blamed it all on Khrushchev, who was a Gentile. After committing this terrible crime against humanity, Kaganovich went back to Moscow and handed the power in Kiev back to Khrushchev. That was the reason why Khrushchev did not wish this to be mentioned along with Kaganovich's other crimes. This was not the only crime they committed together, however. At the beginning of 1954, the highest party leadership (Khrushchev, Malenkov, Kaganovich, who was then vice prime minister) gave the order to test an atom bomb explosion on human beings on the 14th of September in the same year. The bomb, which was set off 500 metres above ground, explo- ded with a force of 40 kilotons. The atom bomb which annihilated Hiro- shima and immediately killed 80 000 people was nowhere near as power- ful (13 kilotons). The experiment took place in the Urals near the village of Totskoye between the towns Kuibyshev and Orenburg, 970 km east of 318"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Moscow (Izvestiya, 14th August 1993). The Soviet authorities wanted to find out how soon they could send in troops to a radiation damaged area. 44 000 soldiers were forced to enter the area just 20 minutes after the explosion. The soldiers, without knowing it, had been sentenced to death. The authorities did not bother to think of the local population by conside- ring the wind direction. The population was never even warned. The radiation level was 10 times (50 Roentgen) higher than the level regarded by the Americans as the highest safety level for human beings. It was impossible to use gas masks, since the air temperature was 45 degrees Centigrade (113 degrees Fahrenheit). A total of just over a million people lived the area (within a 150 km radius of the epicentre). Among the participants was Captain Yuri Sorokin who, after the fall of Communism, sued Russia's Ministry of Defence for 52 million roubles. Marshal Zhukov followed the experim ent from a bunker 25 km away. The minister of defence, Nikolai Bulganin, thought the experiment was a success. After the Second World War, the Soviet Union's people's com- missaries received the more civilised appellation of minister. Similar callousness was shown during the Second World War when the British offercd the Communists mine detectors but a Red Army general refused, saying: \"We don't need them, we have people for that purpose!\" The NKVD sent out political prisoners to clear the minefields under threat of death, according to the historian Nikolai Tolstoy. In 1957, another atom bomb accidentally exploded in the area. This time 10 000 people were evacuated. It may be mentioned here in passing that a few American Jews, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and their helpers Morton and Sobel, handed over all the information necessary for the construction of the atom bomb to the top physicists in the Soviet Union (among others the Jew Leon Landau). Stalin viewed 286 reports about the development of the atom bomb. Klaus Fuchs was among the informers. Beria became chief of the Soviet atom bomb project. The FBI was aware of this but took action only alter the information was safely in Soviet hands. Nobody was intercsted in the possibility of bei ng able to liquidate Communism by threatening the Soviet regime with atomic weapons. 116 atomic explosions above earth and 370 below earth took place in Semipalatinsk between 1949 and 1989. The strength of the explosions was up to l50 kilotons. 800 000 people have severe radiation injuries today. 319"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Their genetic make-up is destroyed.

Stalin had practised all the principles of Marxism-Leninism, secured the dictatorship, liquidated the free market, abolished the idea of ethics, degra- ded the intellectuals, encouraged the class struggle across national boun- daries, tried to exterminate religion, enslaved the workers (who turned to drink instead of working). But the different races did not want to mingle with each other, the believers did not wish to abandon their creeds, the j peasants hated working on collective farms (and became extremely lazy because they were forced to work for someone else's gain). The Communists failed in everything and managed to annihilate vast numbers of people in the process - class enemies and enemies of the people who would have disturbed the build-up of the Illuminist society. The Communists were finally forced to realise that their system was totally unrealistic, just as their opponents had claimed all along. Homo Sovieticus became a worthless tool. It was impossible to continue. The Communists suffered all kinds of setbacks. There were some who began to regret their crimes, like Malenkov who became religious in his old age and was seen in many churches in and around Moscow. He had plenty to atone for. Lazar Kaganovich was not among those few who regretted their actions. He died on the evening of the 25th of July 1991, 97 years old. His immen- sely cruel methods had led nowhere. His life is a terrible lesson for all who really wish to learn from the mistakes of others. 320"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"AMERICAN AID TO THE SOVIET UNION On the 15th of August, 1871, the American general Albert Pike, who was a high-ranking Masonic leader, wrote a letter to the Italian Illuminati leader Giuseppe Mazzini. In that letter, he described his amazing plans, including the destruction of the Russian Empire. The Bolsheviks' path to power was financially paved by Jacob Schiff, Paul Warburg, John Rockefeller, Franklin Vanderlip, John Pierpoint Mor- gan Jr (who gave at least a million dollars to Lenin) and William Averell Harriman from the United States of America. There were also similar forces in Europe with the same aims. There, the English Grand Master Alfred Milner and the Rothschild family supported the Bolsheviks. The Soviet Union began using the red banner of the Rothschilds as the official symbol of Socialism-Communism. There are a few books by honest researchers, including Antony Sutton's \"Will Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\" and Gary Allen's \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\", which expose the financial circles which helped the Bolsheviks remain in power at any cost. Without this financial support it would have been impossible for them to remain in the saddle; Russia would quickly have thrown them off. Doctor of economics Antony C. Sutton spent several years collecting documents to prove this. The material he found is published in a series of books, including the giant, three volume work \"Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development\", published by the Hoover Institute. He has also published two other important books on the subject: \"The National Suicide\" and \"The Best Enemy Money Can Buy\". The American trade embargo was just a gigantic bluff. The totalitarian and completely ineffective Soviet state could never have survived without aid from outside. The history of ancient China provides us with an examplc of a similar state. In the y ear 8 A.D., an important official, Wang Mang, usurped the power and proclaimed himself emperor one year later. He tried to gain control over the economy by the aid of radical (almost 321"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"socialist) reforms. Wang Mang strengthened the central government with characteristic Oriental discipline and severity. He nationalised property and prohibited the selling of slaves. The economic situation deteriorated catastrophically. In the year 17, the peasants had had enough and started a revolt to depose Wang Mang. They were successful and killed him like a mad dog. Antony Sutton emphasised that 95 per cent of the Soviet technology came from the United States of America or their allies. His conclusion was that the Communists would not have been able to remain in power for even a single day without their aid. The Bolsheviks would undoubtedly have lost the four-year-long civil war unless the West had offered to help them. That was why the Allies staged the so-called intervention. U. S. Congress while appropriating billions for defence against Com- munism has at the same time given over six billion dollars in direct military and economic aid to the Communists. Radar-equipped F-86 jet fighter planes worth over 300 000 dollars each have been sold to the Communist dictator of Yugoslavia for 10 000 dollars. The Eisenhower Administration approved it. (\"Report, U.S. Foreign Assistance\", U.S. Agency for Int. Dev., March 21, 1962.) The \"Intervention\" as a Diversion It is necessary to point out that the initiative for the \"intervention\" actually came from the Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky, people's commissary for military affairs, sent a note written in English requesting military aid from the Allies on the 5th of March 1918. British troops were to be sent to Arkhangelsk and American troops were to occupy Vladivostok to prevent the advance of the Japanese. (Yuri Felshtinsky, \"The Failure of the World Revolution\", London, 1991, pp. 283-284.) In the same month (March 19), 2000 British soldiers landed in Mur- mansk. They were to halt the advance of Finnish troops. The local Bolshe- vik leadership received orders from Petrograd to establish an all-round co- operation with the British troops. (Staffan Skott, \"Sovjetunionen fran borjan till slutet\" / \"The Soviet Union from Beginning to End\", Stock- holm, 1992.) Trotsky approved the joint military soviet composed of Bri- tish, Soviet and French representatives. (M. Jaaskelainen, \"Ita-Karjalan 322"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"kysymys: kansallinen laajennusohjelman synty ja sen toteuttamisyritykset Suomen ulkopolitiikassa vuosina 1918- 20\" / \"The Question of Eastern Karelia: The Beginnings of the National Extension Program and Attempts of Finnish Foreign Policy to Realise it in the Years 1918-20\", Helsinki, 1961.) There were officially 10 052 foreign soldiers in Murmansk on the 1st of July 1918, including 6850 Englishmen and also Serbs and Frenchmen. Such official figures are usually debatable. The British Major-General Sir Charlcs Maynard's figure, published in his memoirs \"The Murmansk Venture\", was quite different. He claimed that the Allied troops never exceeded 1500 men. Trotsky had pr eviously demanded aid from the French in founding his Red Army, but Paris had no wish to comply. The American Colonel Raymond Robbins had no scruples about helping the Bolsheviks, however. 4500 American soldiers arrived in Arkhangelsk on the 4th of September 1918, according to Louis Fischer. (\"The Life of Lenin\", London, 1970, p. 430.) The American President Woodrow Wilson had sent two million men to the Western front in the spring of 1917. Maynard himself left England on the 18th of July 1918 with only 150 Royal Marines. The Bolsheviks needed no protection from the Germans, since it was actually the Germans who were protecting the Bolsheviks from the Whites. The British regarded only the White Finns as enemies. The Red Finnish troops, who were pro-Communist, were led by the British, according to General Maynard. When he wanted to hand £150 000 over to the White Russian troops (and a total of 5000 men), London refused to give its approval. He went to London to explain the desperate situation of the Whites. Only then was he given permission to give the money to the Whites, who fought against the Bolsheviks and wanted to re-establish the Tsarist Empire. The Finnish Whites were eager to occupy Murmansk as soon as possible, but the Finnish President, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, after receiving warnings from London, did not dare issue orders to this effect. When it became clear that the White Russian troops in the north were making too great advances, David Lloyd George (freemason) demanded that Churchill should call off the British venture in Murmansk. Demands that the British should cease their aid to the Whites in Russia were also published more frequently in the press. In August 1919, Lord Henry Rawlinson (free- 323"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"mason) was sent from London to Murmansk. He gave instructions to take the British troops home again. In the beginning, the West claimed rather hypocritically that the Bolshe- viks were dangerous. In spite of these warnings, the British sent only a few soldiers to ostensibly fight against the Reds. In actual fact, the Allies avoided disturbing the Bolsheviks. An example of this was when the British promised Boris Savinkov, one of the Social Revolutionary leaders and a freemason, to send two divisions against the Bolsheviks in Arkhangelsk. Only 600 troops were actually sent, and these were not involved in any fighting. Savinkov a ccused the British of secretly aiding the Bolsheviks. President Woodrow Wilson was one of the first heads of state to recognise Soviet Russia. On the 6th of July 1918, the Americans decided to send a further 7 000 soldiers to Vladivostok. The purpose of this was to lessen the Japanese preparedness for action. The Americans soon became worried and were forced to take measures against the Japanese army. On the 26th of August 1918, the American consul in Vladivostok, John Caldwell, sent a telegram to Robert Lansing, the secretary of state in Washington: \"Nearly 18 000 Japanese soldiers have landed in Vladivostok. Another 6000 are en route to the front in Manchuria. The Japanese are pushing forward everywhere they can... the situation is critical.\" (\"Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1918, Russian\", Vol. II, pp. 328-29.) The Americans regarded the situati on as dangerous primarily because the Japanese overthrew the Soviet regime everywhere they came. There were already 70 000 Japanese soldiers in the Far East in the beginning of November 1918, according to official sources. Robert Lansing, by the way, did not conceal his opinion that the Bolshevik Jews were spiritually underdeveloped, i.e.: primitive beings. Despite the strict Soviet censorship, one important and revealing phrase could still be read in certain collections: \"The American government was obviously against the Japanese advance.\" (\"Documents of Foreign Politics of the Soviet Union\", Vol. I, Moscow, 1957, p. 225.) This sentence was later censored, since the falsifiers of history regarded it as much too dangerous and revealing. The civil war was too exhausting for Lenin. That was why the West increased its contributions to bring an end to it. The Allies began to 324"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"withdraw and their equipment was left to the Bolsheviks. As early as in March 1918, five American officers had begun to train Red Army units. The Americans also sent some war equipment to the Bolsheviks, according to Antony Sutton (\"The National Suicide\", Melbourne, 1973, p. 76). Sutton refers to another important document, which proves that Trotsky asked the American ambassador, David R. Francis, for official aid to train the Red Army in 1919. The United States, being a mighty military power, made certain that the Japanese did not threaten the establishment of the Soviet regime. The United States occupied the Far East until the Red Army could stand on its own feet and control the Soviet territory. President Woodrow Wilson had given corresponding secret instructions to the commander of the American troops in the Far East, William S. Graves. Antony Sutton referred to those documents. The Americans controlled the Trans-Siberian Railway, so it was easy for them to drive Kolchak's White forces out of Vladivostok. They could eventually ceremoniously hand the entire area over to the Bolsheviks. An announcement about this event was published in The New York Times on the 15th of February 1920. The Associated Press related in a telegram that street meetings and celebration parades were held in Vladivostok after admiral Alexander Kolchak's troops had been forced to leave. Red flags fly on many houses. In ceremonious speeches the Americans were called real friends who had at a critical time saved the situation. The Americans, on their part, stressed that they did not wish to invade the Far East by controlling certain Soviet areas, but that the operation should be regarded as the Allies' contribution to peaceful settlement of the local situation. General Alexei von Lampe revealed in the Russian exile periodical Russky Kolokol No 6 and No 7, 1929, published in Berlin, that the purpose of the Allied presence in Russia was to ward off the German threat against the Allies. There were several thousand foreign soldiers stationed near Murmansk and Arkhangelsk in Northern Russia. When the Russian front became superfluous, they simply left the scene of operations. Before this happened, the Allies suggested that the White Russian troops, too, should call off their military activities. When the Whites refused to do so, the English dumped their equipment and ammunition in the sea. Alexei von Lampe described the events outside Petrograd when the British navy deserted General Nikolai Yudenich's White forces in 1919. 325"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"They were no longer given any support. Of course, there were Englishmen who did not wish to side with the Bolsheviks. One of these was Crombie, the British military attache in Petrograd. He was removed in an original manner. The Red Guards simply forced their way into the British Embassy on the 31st of August 1918 and murdered Crombie. No one there offered any resistance. Winston Churchill wrote a letter to the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, on the 21st of February 1919. He had no objections to the general standpoint that the Russians had to take care of themselves. David Lloyd George officially explained the motive for not helping the White Russians in the following way: \"To send our soldiers to shoot Bolsheviks would be the same as creating Bolshevism here at home.\" (Paul Johnson, \"Modern Times\", Stockholm, 1987, p. 108.) He justified his co-operation with the Bolsheviks in this way: \"We have made deals with cannibals, why not with the Bolsheviks?\" Lloyd George was in favour of active contributions to aid the Soviet government. A trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Great Britain was signed on the 16th of March 1921. On the 14th of February 1919, President Wilson demanded a withdrawal of the foreign forces in Russia. The Bolsheviks were simply to be left in peace. He explained this demand in a most peculiar manner: \"There is no use for our forces in Russia.\" The American President's position is quite clear from his message, which was read at the Fourth Extra-Ordinary Soviet Congress on March 14, 1918. He wrote, among other things that the United States' government will do all it can to help Russia become completely soverei gn and independent in its own internal affairs as well as recreating its important role in Europe and in the life of our present society. Those were not just fair words - United States of America immediately began supporting the Bolsheviks in all imaginable ways. By 1920, the Americans had already built two harbours in the Far East for Soviet Russia. Forty-five thousand French soldiers (the number is probably exaggerated) were stationed near Odessa and on the Crimean Peninsula. The French also deserted the Whites. The Allied forces suddenly left the theatre of war and refused to fight the Bolsheviks. At the same time, the Frenchmen in Berezovsky near Odessa handed the first tanks over to the Reds. The whole story must have seemed very puzzling to the Whites, especially since the Bolsheviks, according to the French, had German 326"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"instructors. The Allies were officially supposed to combat the Germans on all fronts. Secret documents were later found, which explained a lot about this situation. It was revealed that the English were allowed to supply the Whites only with foodstuffs and that the French had received orders to remain completely passive, also at the time of General Anton Denikin's trouble with the Reds in Caucasia. The passive French forces were entirely withdrawn from Russia on the 5-6th of April 1919. Alexei von Lampe claimed that the Allied contributions were just a mirage or Communist propaganda. Neither did the Allies ever co-ordinate their activities. This sabotaged the operations of the White Army, which was comprised of nationnalist volunteers. The Allies thwarted the Whites at all times, and in the beginning they even fought against them. Meanwhile, the Bolsheviks received all kind of help, money and information from the West. Britain sent rifles and ammunition for 250 000 men to Soviet Russia, according to The Manchester Guardian (2nd of May 1919). The Whites received an insignificant portion of this shipment. The Frenchmen only gave tiny sums of money to the Whites. The Allies even gave the Bolsheviks direct aid when they conquered the Ukraine, whereas the Ukrainian nationalist leader and freemason Simon Petlyura's freedom fighters received no aid at all (\"Ukraine & Ukrainians\" by Dr Ivan Owechko, Greeley, Colorado, 1984, p. 114). Of all their opponents, the Bolsheviks fought hardest against Simon Petlyura. In all the areas he conquered, the people celebrated the demise of the Red Jewish regime. Those celebrations were called \"Jew-pogroms\" in the Communist propaganda. Petlyura had to flee to Poland in October 1919. His later attempts to save the Ukraine from the yoke of Communist barnarism also failed. The West had staked everything on the Bolsheviks. Moscow, meanwhile, could not forget Petlyura's struggle against them. that was why the Jewish Bolshevik and freemason Samuel Schwartzbart murdcrcd him in Paris on the 26th of May 1926. (Georg Leibbrant, \"Ukraine\".) According to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia, this was the Jews' revenge. No one was allowed to threaten their power. The Whites treated their opponents somewhat differently. In 1918, a newspaper editor in Yekaterinoslavl published an exhortation to fight against General Lavr Kornilov. He was merely banned from the city for his crime.

The Soviet Union was founded by the same financial circle, which had broken up Europe at Versailles and thereby created the necessary conditions for the outbreak of the Second World War. This circle has controlled both sides in several wars. 328 "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Bcing a freemason, the American President Woodrow Wilson (1856- 1924) had very reluctantly sent 4500 troops to Northern Russia, since the freemason and supreme commander of the Allied troops, Ferdinand Foch, had demanded it. The historian Louis Fischer confirms in his biography of Lenin that Wilson tried to keep the American presence to a minimum - the American forces did virtually nothing in Northern Russia. The official numbers were also greatly exaggerated. Fischer stressed that the foreign troops played a very small role for the outcome of the civil war. (Louis Fischer, \"The Life of Lenin\", London, 1970, p. 489.) So, the United States of America and their allies were not at all interested in deposing the Bolsheviks. The formerly secret and extremely interesting reports about the Russian civil war in the archives of the American State Department confirm this fact. These papers have been available to researchers since September 1958. Among other documents there are the instructions from the State Department which were telegraphed to the American ambassador, David Francis, on the 15th of February 1918, telling him to maintain close unofficial contact with the Bolsheviks, so that there would be no need to recognise the Soviet regime officially. Francis had suggested crushing the Bolsheviks altogether. Washington ignored this suggestion. It would not have been difficult to crush the Bolsheviks, if there had been any real wish to do so, since they were exceedingly weak in the middle of 1918. In July 1918, the Germans and the Chinese who crushed the Social Revolutionaries' revolt saved them. The Finnish General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim also believed that his well-disciplined troops were capable of conquering Eastern Karelia and deposing Lenin (who was totally ignorant of military tactics) in Petrograd. The Germans prohibited that action, however. Then threats came from the British. London even considered a declaration of war against Finland if the Finns really threatcned the Bolsheviks. (M. Jaaske lainen, \"Ita-Karjalan kysymys...\" / \"The Ouestion of Eastern Karelia...\", Helsinki, 1961.) In the spring of 1918, Leon Trotsky asked for economic aid from the United States in order to be able to combat the Whites more efficiently. Lenin also asked President Wilson for help in building up his socialist state, according to Louis Fischer's \"The Life of Lenin\" (London, 1970). Of course, the United States gave the Bolsheviks all kinds of aid. The American ambassador, David Francis, reported to Washington on the 17th 329"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"of March 1918 that Trotsky wanted five American military experts, traffic controllers for railways, and equipment (U.S. State Department Decimal File. 861.00/1341). Trotsky wrote offici ally in Russkoye Slovo on the 20th of March 1918 that it was impossible to be allied with the United States. This manoeuvre belonged to the rules of the game. When Lenin began nationalising foreign companies in 1918, he made exceptions of the American companies. Louis Fischer confirms this in his book \"The Life of Lenin\" (London, 1970). The Americans were allowed to keep control of Singer and Westinghouse, International Harvester and other firms. The Allies made a complete withdrawal from Northern Russia in order to seriously damage the morale of the White troops after General Anton Denikin had managed to conquer Kiev on the 31 st of August 1919 and had begun marching on Moscow. This was revealed in Paul Johnson's book \"Modern Times\" (Stockholm, 1987, p. 109). The Polish socialist General Jozef Pilsudski was very successful, however. He defeated the Bolsheviks at the battle of the Wisla. Being a freemason, he was immediately thereafter forced to agree to peace with Lenin. Lenin later admitted that if Pilsudski had continued the war for just one more week, it would have meant the end of the Bolsheviks' powcr, since General Peter von Wrangel's forces were approaching and the Reds were unable to counter them. The Polish Jews, meanwhile, helped Lenin's troops very actively when the Red Army attacked Poland in 1918-19. The Intervention and the economic blockade were, unfortunately, just a ridiculous myth. The international financial elite needed this diversion to be able to quickly introduce a totalitarian form of capitalism without mar- ket economy - the most important form of Illuminism, which we know by the name of Communism - in Russia. The Western financial elite wanted to use market economy capitalism as an anvil and Communism as a hammer to rule the world and entirely subdue it, as the American historian and publicist Gary Allen expressed it in his book \"None Dare Call It! Conspiracy\". The Soviet Union was later transformed into a base for the destabilisation of the rest of the world. This was the reason win everything possible was done to keep Moscow's Communist Empire alive, despite the fact that it had entered the world as an economic monstrosity that had to be constantly kept alive. At the same time, the false fronts of Communism had to be set up. 330"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Oswald Spengler, a great thinker and historian of our century who wrote the important book \"Der Untergang des Abendlandes\" (\"The Decline of the West\") also perceived the fact that the left wing political parties are controlled by the very same men of finance whom they officially regard as their enemies. He claimed: \"There is no proletarian, not even a communist movement that has not operated in the interests of moncy, in the direction indicated by money - and that without the idealists among the leaders having the slightest suspicion of the fact.\" Spengler went so far as to call socialism the capitalism of the lower class. Reginald McKenna (head of the Midland Bank in Great Britain) admitted forthrightly: \"Those who find and hand out the money and the credit, direct the government's policy and hold the fate of nations in their hands.\" Several serious works have demonstrated by means of documents that each and every war in Europe during the last two centuries has been caused by the financial elite in their own interests. Commander William Guy Carr confirmed in his book \"Pawns in the Game\" that the Jacobin Napoleon Bonaparte was, in the beginning, the loyal servant of the financial elite (he was a passive bystander on the side of the Robespierre brothers during the so-called French Revolution, but violently put down the royalists' revolt in 1795). He finally understood the nature of the dirty game he was taking part in, began working against it, and was conse- quently removed. The American president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, once admitted that nothing in politics happens by accident. If anything happens, you can be sure that it was planned that way. A famous Jewish Illuminatus and freemason, Walter Rathenau, who became minister of finance in the German Weimar Republic, admitted in 1912: \"Three hundred men, who all know each other, control the finances of Europe and appoint successors from their own ranks.\" (Wiener Presse, 24th of December 1912.) Everything has been done according to the programme. That was revealcd by Walter Rathenau in Paris, 1913, when the financial elite and the Illuminati founded the International Bank Alliance: \"The moment has come for the financial elite to officially dictate their laws to the world, as they have previously done only covert ly... The financial elite will be required to succeed empires and kingdoms with an authority which does not extend only to one country, but spans the entire world.\" 331"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" It is therefore hardly surprising that the Bolsheviks received enough rifles and ammunition from the West to crush the Whites. The Western democracies paid no heed to the reports which related that the majority of those killed by the Reds were common people, the poor, the workers, even pregnant women. This was confirmed by a 90-year-old exiled Estonian, Kustav Pohla, in 1978. He had witnessed those crimes in Russia himself. (Eesti Pdevaleht, Stockholm, 8th of April 1978.) The Famine as a Weapon Lenin knew he could break the back of the Whites by damaging the peasants. The systematic confiscation of agricultural produce led to a terrible famine which, in turn, caused epidemics of typhus and other severe illnesses. People began plundering. The situation was chaotic. The fact that the confiscated grain was sold abroad was concealed from the public. In this way Lenin used the famine as a weapon against his enemies. Another reason for the famine was to establish the Bolshevik regime and to reduce the Russian population, according to Vladimir Soloukhin (\"In the Light of Day\", Moscow, 1992, p. 52). The situation deteriorated drastically. Therefore, the Bolsheviks had to stop confiscating grain in 332"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"1921, but it was already too late. Ten million people were starving in July 1921. During the winter of 1921-22, 35 million were without food. (Vladimir Berelovich's article \"The Diplomacy of Starvation\" in the weekly newspaper Russkaya Mysl, Paris, 27th of September 1985.) Lenin exploited the situation and set up food-traps, Torgsin, where people could buy macaroni, lard, grain, for gold or foreign currency. All who tried to buy anything were imm ediately seized and forcibly relieved of all their gold. They were also forced to explain where they had got their money. Millions of lives were saved by various private organisations from Sweden and the United States - above all by ARA (American Relief Administration). ARA collected 70 million dollars (56 million of this came from the donations of Americans). This money was enough to buy food for 18 million Russians. Lenin had collected 400 million roubles in gold from Kiev, 500 million from Odessa and 100 million from Kharkov, but he felt absolutely no inclination to give any of it away to the starving. He announced: \"We have no money!\" (Igor Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 85.) Meanwhile, the bands of criminals and robbers Trotsky had set free continued to pillage the country. Later, Mao Zedong in China also used criminals. The famine threatened to bring tens of millions of people to their graves. Cannibalism occurred in the hardest hit areas. A committee called Pomgol was established to help the starving. Russia's most eminent citizens joined this group. What happened after- wards was perfectly revolting. The committee had scarcely been formed before all of its members, except Maxim Gorky and Vera Figner, were arrested. They had distributed foodstuffs and medicines. The Bolsheviks did not like the fact that the members of the committee had talked about the cause of the famine, which amounted to criticism against the War Communism. When the committee had been dissolved, all aid ceased (Stanislav Govorukhin's film \"Our Lost Russia\"). The ARA was accused of espionage. Five million people died of starvation during 1921-22, according to official sources. The emigrants claimed that the real figure was signi- flcantly higher. The Russian press has also demonstrated this more recently. Lenin was responsible for all these lives. 333"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"The cruel War Communism did not work, despite the vast amounts of foreign aid, and already at the beginning of 1921 Lenin was forced to say: \"It is finished!\" The international financial elite did not want to give up. however. Colossal measures were soon taken and in the beginning of March 1921, Lenin announced that a new economic policy - the NEP - was to be enforced. This was done to save Communism from its economic crisis and to calm the many revolts of the peasants across Russia, since these were another important contributory cause of the introduction of the NEP. Lenin permitted foreigners to start so-called concession companies, where the Westerners owned 51 per cent and the Soviet side owned 49 per cent. Antony Sutton emphasised in an article that the Soviet censorship later did everything in its power to erase all information about these co- operative businesses from the history books. Lenin called this reform campaign the \"policy of two steps forward, one step backwards\". He proclaimed that the doors were open to foreign capital and Western technology. He encouraged the setting up of private ventures within agri- culture, the services and small home-based businesses. From 1922, Lenin permitted the founding of 330 co-operative companies and another 134 firms, which dealt with technical aid. On the 21st of February 1922, Pravda wrote about how the American Barksdall Corporation began delivering modern equipment to the oil industry in Baku. Singer was another business, which founded a concession company in 1925. The Bolsheviks later took over this firm entirely. Many other companies could, for a subsequent period, co-operate quite openly with the Communists and even take their profits out of the Soviet Union. Those businessmen included Armand Hamm er and W. Averell Harriman, who became the American ambassador in Moscow in 1943. This open co- operation continued up to 1937 in certain areas. On October 28, 1921, Lenin gave the Jewish businessman Armand Hammer what amounted to a monopoly. His family had emigrated from Odessa to America where he had founded the American Communist Party together with his father. He later arranged for himself to represent 38 American companies (including Ford) in Moscow. Hammer co-operated with nearly all the Communist leaders. He met Gorbachev for the first time on the 18th of June 1985. Stalin was the only one who gave him any trouble. In 1930 Stalin refused to have anything to do with Hammer and he 334"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"was forced to cease his activities in Moscow. The reason for this was that Hammer had co-operated too closely with Leon Trotsky. Lenin, as previously mentioned, was more interested in appropriating the property and riches of the Russians than in practising Utopian socialism. The Swedish socialists, too, in the name of \"fair distribution\", have transformed their subjects into tax-slaves of the financial elite. In this situation, the plundering escalated. It was primarily \"the greedy Jew\", Armand Hammer, who brought the Tsars' and the aristocrats' jewels and art to America where it was sold to other rich Jews. (Everything according to Svenska Dagbladet, 30th of March 1987.) Hammer began his \"business\" with Lenin by exchanging gems and furs for foodstuffs, of which the Russians would have produced a surplus themselves if Lenin had not destroyed their capacity to do so. This was a part of the bandits' plan. In this way, the Faberge eggs, the diamond-topped tiaras and the icons, which had been plundered from the churches, ended up in the hands of Armand and his brother Victor Hammer. When their supplies were finished, new stolen goods were brought in from the Soviet Union; this presented no difficulty since the bandit chieftains in Moscow were always eager to fatten up their foreign bank accounts a little more with the help of Armand Hammer and other fences. Lenin had said to Armand Hammer: \"Soviet Russia needs American capital and technical aid to get the wheels rolling again.\" {Dagens (Nyheter, 25th of November 1984.) When Hammer later landed in Moscow with his private aeroplane, he never needed to go through the passport or customs control. Everyone was equal, but it appears that some were more equal than others. \"It was Lenin who convinced me to become a capitalist,\" Hammer later declared. In 1980, the Communist billionaire Hammer \"donated\" the Sovincentre, a gigantic office block, to Moscow, in order to watch his interests more closely. Hammer's chemical factories in the Soviet Union devastated the natural environment as well as the people's health (for example, in Ventspils in occupied Latvia). But he did not care. The most important thing was his profit. He never had enough! Hammer did not conceal his satanic attitude: \"He who tells the truth has no future. The future is built exclusively on lies.\" Those lies have now turned back upon the liars. During the NEP period, Lenin also performed the political manoeuvre of changing the name of the Cheka into the GPU (the Board of 335"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Government Politics) on the 6th of February 1922. He returned several companies to their original owners, but they were later re-confiscated. In June 1925, the GPU chief of the Lubensk area (in the Ukraine), Dviyannikov, sent a secret circular to his district chiefs. Dviyannikov instructed the GPU to keep a low profile during the passive NEP period, but to keep gathering information about the enemies of the Soviet regime so that they would be ready to strike the killing blow against these forces at the right moment. He encouraged his underlings to be more active in their spying on the people so that the lists would be ready when it was time to begin liquidating the enemies of the people, whose smiles of relief would soon enough be replaced by grimaces of fear. He was expecting the enemies to reveal themselves. The Soviet propaganda has eagerly spread the myth about the Western threat to the Communist system in Russia. This propaganda completely lacked substance, however. This can easily be proved with the following facts. In March 1924, the Commander-in-Chief Mikhail Frunze demanded that the Red Army be dissolved because it had turned into a band of thieves and robbers. This was done - in complete secrecy. Only the commanders remained. So, the Soviet Union was actually without an army throughout the summer of 1924. Frunze began building up a new army only in the autumn of 1924, when he drafted a large number of young peasants. The leading circles in the West were well aware of this fact, but concealed it from the public. They had no wish to eliminate Communism, even though they knew that Communism was a kind of system in which great efforts were made to solve problems which would never have existed without Communism... Deals with the Bolsheviks Soon after the Bolsheviks had reached power, Standard Oil bought up hall of the oil wells in Caucasia even though these were officially nationalised. This information comes from Harvey O'Connor's book \"The Empire of Oil\", New York, 1955, p. 270. Antony Sutton explains that Standard Oil of New York built a refiners in Russia in 1921 to strengthen the Bolshevik economy. Standard Oil and its subsidiary company Vacuum Oil sold the Soviet oil in the European 336"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"countries. Closely associated with Standard Oil and other Rockefeller concerns was Jacob Schiff of the Wall Street banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb &Co. The newspaper National Republic announced in September 1927 that the Bolsheviks had even been given a loan of 65 million dollars. In 1928, the Rockefeller Chase National Bank began selling Bolshevik bonds in the United States of America. Nineteen large oil refineries were constructed in the Soviet Union between 1917 and 1930, but only one of these contained units manufactured in the Soviet Union. Even in the beginning, large amounts of industrial equipment, agri- cultural machinery and munitions were brought into Soviet Russia from the United States. During the years 1921-25, the Americans delivered 37 million dollars worth of machinery and other technology to the Bolshe- viks. In return, American companies were given goldmining rights by the Amur River. The British company Lena Goldfields Ltd built a modern mine with all the necessary equipment near Vitimsk on the taiga near the river Lena. A tried and tested technique was later used to conceal this gift: the Bolsheviks imprisoned all the leading British engineers and accused them of economic espionage. The less important aid-lenders and businessmen acting on their own began experiencing severe problems with the local Bolshevik leaders who took the official anti-capitalist propaganda seriously. A Czech citizen, Benedickt, who lived in Vienna, arrived in Russia at the beginning of 1924. He bought a steamboat and loaded it up with valuable goods. He had received official permission. The GP U in Novorossiysk laid an embargo on the steamer and incarcerated Mr. Benedickt. The central leadership immediately ordered them to release Benedickt and return his goods, but the local authorities refused to obey. Benedickt ended up in Siberia (in prison in Novo-Nikolaievsk). He was later sent to a prison in Solovky whcrc he stayed for three years. A Finnish businessman could find no suitable lodgings in Moscow. At this point, the GPU came to his rescue and offered him a room at the GPU headquarters. He ended up in the Butyrka prison. Businessmen of th is kind, including one named Koch, were commonly accused of espionage. (A. Klinger \"The Soviet Forced Labour\", 1928.) General Electric (a Morgan Subsidiary) in the United States made an especially large contribution to the build-up of the Soviet Empire. This company helped to carry out the GOELRO plan, which was designed to 337"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"electrify Russia through the building of 100 power stations between 1920 and 1935. Zinoviev instead spoke of 27 power stations in January 1921. Only a small part of the plan was actually carried out. The company's representative Carl Steinmetz turned to Lenin on the 16th of February 1922 and wished him the best of luck with the build-up of his socialist state. Lenin thanked Steinmetz for his aid in his written answer. (Lenin, \"Collected Works\", Vol. 27, pp. 275-276, and p. 539.) It should probably be mentioned here that the directors of General Electric and Standard Oil were also members of CFR (the Council on Foreign Relations). This group has a great influence on society, according to the Chicago Tribune (9th of November 1950). They have exploited the prestige which their riches, social position and upbringing have given them to lead their nation into bankruptcy and military decline. Between the years 1927 and 1932, American and British engineers built the Dneprogess power station with the aid of American technology and Russian slaves. Colonel Hugh Cooper completed the building in 1932. The Dneprogess, which was 760 metres long and 60 metres tall, was called the world's largest building. It produced 2.5 billion Kwh of electricity per year. In the beginning, the power stations (Volkhov, Svir and Dneprogess) were constructed entirely by General Electric. The company later planned a large turbine factory in Kharkov, so that the Russians would be able to produce their own turbines. The production of this factory was two and half times greater than that of General Electric's factories in the U.S.A. Six British engineers (including Thornton from Metropolitan Vickers) were sentenced to forced labour for \"sabotage\" in 1933, in order to frighten the other foreign engineers into silence. (Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 245.) Meanwhile, more and more gold ended up in the treasure chambers of the banking elite. American companies began to build up Soviet Russia's heavy industry as early as the beginning of the 1920s. Arthur G. McKee from Cleveland designed the world's largest steelworks in Magnitogorsk in 1928 and the construction was begun in January 1929. It became a replica of the Garg steelworks in Indiana. All the equipment came from the United States of America, from the Clearing Mach Corporation, among others. The eight largest ovens were also constructed for the Bolsheviks. The whole complex was 17 kilometres in length, something 338"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Kremlin immediately began to boast about in its propaganda, as it did about all the other giant projects which the Americans undertook for the Soviet Union. They had even worked out in advance the number of Russian workers and slaves, which they expected to perish during the construction. German and American experts and workers also worked there. One of these was John Scott who was employed as a welder in September 1932. He worked in Magnitogorsk for five years. John Scott was lucky enough to receive permission to leave the Soviet Union before the Second World War. Most of the foreign experts had already left in 1932. The steel production increased to 4.2 million tons in 1928. According to the plan, it was to have risen to 10.5 million tons, but even 1933, the last year of the first five-year plan, yielded only 5.9 million tons of steel. So the production had only increased by 1.7 million tons. Thus only 57 per cent of the plan was achieved. The same happened in all areas, since the production was always of a much lower quality than the calculations accounted for. Stalin still proclaimed that the first five-year plan had been 93.7 per cent successful. The monopolised economy eventually turned into organised poverty. A period of even more extensive industrialisation in the Soviet Union bega in 1926, two years after Lenin's death. During two years (1926-27) most of the 788 major factories were built with American aid. Antony Sutton revealed: \"There is a report in the State Department files that names Kuhn, Loeb and Co. as the financier of the First Five Year Plan.\" (Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development\", Vol. II.) During this five-year period (1928-33) a total of 1500 industrial companies were built, including an aircraft factory and new tractor and car plants, according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia (Tallinn, 1973, Vol. 5, p. 439). Collectivisation as a Weapon There were only 7000 tractors in the Soviet Union in the beginning of 1929. Tanks had to be used for ploughing at the start of the collectivi- sation. The number of tractors increased to 30 000 by the end of the same war. Some of these had been bought directly from the USA. At least 339"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"250 000 tractors were needed for the collectivisation. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. accordingly increased their aid contributions to Moscow in order to neutralise the independent peasant (he was much too dangerous for the dictators) and force him to work on the kolkhozes (kibbutzes). Eighty American companies took part in the building of three gigantic tractor factories in Russia. The factory in Stalingrad was actually built in the United States, brought to the Soviet Union in parts and fitted together in three months. Twenty-six American companies joined in this project alone. The Bolsheviks wanted to produce 50 000 tanks and caterpillar tractors each year. Factories were built in the same way in Kharkov and Chelyabinsk. The building of the last-named tractor and tank factory was planned and led by an engineer from Detroit named Calder. In the be- ginning, these factories were all supervised by Western engineers. The Americans also built a modern asbestos industry for Moscow and designed the irrigation system for Central Asia, which has now virtually destroyed the Aral Sea. It shrank from 62 000 square kilometres in 1923 to just 40 000 in 1990. The independent farmers and peasants were regarded as especially dangerous since the agricultural system had once more begun to produce a surplus of foodstuffs. The agricultural expert Vladimir Tikhonov also confirmed in Literaturnaya Gazeta on the 4th of August 1988 that Stalin's claim that the collectivisation had been undertaken due to the food shortage was entirely false. In actual fact, the agricultural system had begun recuperating fairly quickly after Lenin had given the peasants their land back and abolished the government control of them. The situation was almost normal by 1927 and Russia had once more begun exporting grain. 100 000 tons of grain were exported by Russia in 1928, 1.3 million tons in 1929, 4.8 million tons in 1930 and 5.1 million tons in 1931. At this point Stalin and Kaganovich began to implement Trotsky's insane idea of agricultural collectivisation. Stalin declared that, after the quick industrialisation (which was called 'perestroika'), they would be able to supply the cities with food from giant farms. That argument was completely fallacious, according to Tikhonov. Fifteen million people lost their homes as a result of the collectivi- sation. Many peasants ran away from the kolkhoses to the cities. One million were sent to labour camps and 12 million were deported to Siberia, because Stalin and Kaganovich had all peasants who owned more than one 340"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"hectare of land stamped as class enemies. The agricultural production levels sank massively after the collectivisation. After this, Stalin's henchman Kaganovich organised a famine during the years 1932-33 which sent nearly eight million Ukrainians and two million Russians in northern Caucasia, by the Volga Delta, and in other places, to their graves. The British historian Robert Conquest has even claimcd that the number of victims amounted to 15 million. (\"The Harvest of Sorrow\", Alberta, 1986.) Several Russian historians have arrived at the same figure. The famine was brought about by ordering troops to confiscate the entire grain reserve. The United States calmly watched as this tragedy took place. In Yalta, Stalin cynically assured Churchill and Roosevelt that ten million people had fallen victim to his reforms. He undercstimated the total, which has later been estimated at closer to 48 million. All rumours about the famine were officially denied, no help was given to the suffering areas, no (humiliating) aid from abroad would be accepted. As previously mentioned, a new famine was organised in the Ukraine between 1946 and 1947, in which two million people died. At the same time, the Ukrainians were forced to supply the Soviet Army (several million men) with food. The Chinese and Ethiopian Communists also used starvation as a weapon. The collectivisation caused an enormous erosion of earth from the usable land, which resulted in the destruction of many villages and later led to the introduction of a rationing system. The historian Sergei Kharlamov, a specialist on the circumstances sur- rounding the forced collectivisation, emphasised that the first five-year plan caused a backlash in the industrial production since the Russians wasted large amounts of metals, resources and energy, often to no pur- pose. Sergei Kharlamov even goes so far as to claim that if the German- Soviet conflict had broken out a few years later than 1941, the Soviet Union would have broken apart on its own as a result of Stalin's economy and oppression. Kharlamov wrote the following about the politics of the Soviet Union: \"There were no advances. Quite the opposite, in fact.\" Wagens Nyheter, 7th of April 1988.) Moscow's Communist leadership becamc over more dependent on American aid. That was the intention. A similar situation occurred in China in the 1950s during the so-called \"Great Lcap Forward\". 341"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The international financial elite was not worried by this development. The false fronts of Communism had to be built up at all costs. America's leading capitalists and politicians did not lose any sleep over the millions of people who were at the same time being taken to Gulag camps to die. These amounted to 15 million between 1926 and 1938, according to inves- tigations made by the historian Dmitri Yurasov. (Dagens Nyheter, 7th April 1988.) It was later revealed that the figure had actually been even higher. The people's commissary for foreign affairs, Maxim Litvinov, met the banker Paul Warburg (Kuhn, Loeb & Co.) at a conference in London in 1933, at which the world economy was discussed. The Soviet Union received a huge loan shortly thereafter. Universal Oil Products, the Badger Corporation, the Lummus Company. Alco Products, the McKee Corporation and the Kellogg Company, among others built up the Soviet oil industry. In June 1944 Stalin admitted to the American ambassador, W. Averell Harriman, that two thirds of the Soviet large industry had been founded by American companies. Stalin added that Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy had built up the rest. This was exactly what Harriman wrote in his report to the U.S. State Department in Washington D.C. Contract followed contract. In 1922 the Russo-American trade dele- gation, the primary task of which was to save the Bolshevik economy, was founded. Rockefeller's Chase National Bank played the main role in this delegation. Herbert Clark Hoover (backed by the extremely influential Council on Foreign Relations) found the money for food deliveries. But Lenin used this capital exclusively for his own and the highest leaders' personal needs, according to the historian Gary Allen (\"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\"). The peasants who were given back their land were forced to look after themselves - which they also did, as the reader will soon realise. On the 30th of December 1922, the Soviet Russian Empire was officially named the Soviet Union. The American government could not maintain diplomatic ties with the Soviet state since the American public had a very negative view of the Communist barbarism. That was why the financial circles did what they could to paint as fair a picture as possible of the Soviet regime in the press. The truth had to be concealed Rockefeller hired the advertising bureau Ivy Lee to paint the Bolsheviks in the warmest possible colours. Ivy Le e even claimed that the Bolsheviks 342"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"should be regarded as confused idealists and benefactors of mankind. He made propaganda for a recognition of the Soviet Union, added that the Communists were \"all right\" and that there was really no Communist problem. It was just a psychological error. Walter Duranty, the correspondent for the New York Times in Moscow, did all he could to portray the mock trials of the 1930s as favourably as possible - he even justified them (Dagens Nyheter, 29th of September 1990). These American journalists knew full well what was really happe- ning, since they have written about it themselves in their memoirs. The American editorial staff did not permit them to tell the truth. It was not surprising, therefore, that Stalin, who was kindly called \"Uncle Joe\", was named man of the year by Time Magazine in 1939. AdoIf Hitler had received the same honour the year before. Ivy Lee had advertised Hitler in the same manner. Time explained their decision in the following way: \"Hitler is a guarantee for world peace.\" But when the British newspaper the Manchester Guardian's reporter published an article about the mass fatality in the countryside as early as in 1933, the \"progressive\" Western opinion did not wish to believe him. Build-Up of the Soviet Regime The Germans also eagerly took part in the build-up of the Soviet Union since they were expecting large profits and the chance to rebuild their own war machine... After the First World War, the Versailles treaty prohibited Germany from developing a war industry and the aeroplane factories Jun- kers, Dornier and Rohrbach were forced to move abroad. The Rapallo treaty, signed by Soviet Russia and Germany on the 16th of April 1922, gave Junkers-Werke the chance to found the aircraft industry FIL near Moscow. The factory was completed by April 1924. German pilots were given the opportunity to train there. The factory, under the direction of Junkers and with licence from Mercedes Benz, began producing 300 aeroplanes per year of which the Soviet government bought 60. Junkers also had a gifted pupil at the FIL factory, Andrei Tupolev, who later constructed the ANT-5 fighter with American aid. Junkers built another factory in the province of Tver, where German engineers were employed. Junkers also produced passenger planes at that 343"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"plant. The aeroplane engines and the spare parts were bought for Moscow by the Chase National Bank, which remained the prime helping hand. Rothschild's banks in Great Britain, France and the United States of America were also used to finance the war industry in the Soviet Union and Germany between 1925 and 1939... Alexander Solzhenitsyn pointed out in his \"Letter to the Leaders of the Soviet Union\" (Paris, 1974), that Moscow had, after the signing of the Rapallo treaty, allowed the Wehrmacht to train German officers in modern blitzkrieg tactics. The Red Army also found the joint tank manoeuvres in the Ukraine useful. The Soviet Union began a large-scale co-operation with Krupp, who from the beginning only sold locomotives from their factory in Essen. Krupp had, up to 1927, built 17 weapon factories in Leningrad, Petrokre- post and Central Asia. Krupp also began producing submarines in Lenin- grad and Nikolaievsk. They built diesel motors for the Bolsheviks and founded, in northern Caucasia, the first model of a mechanised agri- cultural co-operative. Tanks were produced in the tractor factory in Rostov na Donu, which was built by Krupp. A training ground for tanks was built in Kazan where also German tank crews were allowed to practise. In addition, Moscow had an agreement with the Jewish aeroplane manufacturer Ernst Heinrich Heinkel, who sold fighter planes assembled from parts, which had been sent from Germany to the Soviet Union. AEG and Linke-Hoffman-Werke also moved their factories to the Soviet Union. Russia's economy had begun sliding backwards immediately after the Bolshevik take-over. In 1920, the industrial production reached only 13.8 per cent of what it had been in 1913. Unemployment increased. Salt production sank massively to just 25 million tons. Russia had produced 122 million tons of salt annually in the Tsarist era. The party apparatus, however, increased enormously, despite all attempts to limit this development. The propaganda beat all previous records for lying. It was only revealed in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, in October 1988, that the world-famous record worker Alexei Stakhanov was a bluff. Two other workers helped him when he set his legendary coal mining record on the 31st of August 1935. Stakhanov was 29 years old when he supposedly mined 105 tons of coal in 5 hours and 45 minutes (his ordinary shift). This was 15 times the average and led to a huge propaganda campaign. 344"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Stakhanov even had a town named after him, where a statue of him was raised. Stakhanov died in 1977 at 71 years of age. Stalin intended to uniform the population. Different groups (workers, intellectuals, party functionaries and others) were to wear special overalls in symbolic colours. But the foreign sponsors had no desire to pay for this project and so the idea was shelved. After the Second World War, Stalin succeeded in uniforming at least a part of the population: railwaymen, guards and the militia wore blue soldier-shirts (gimnastyorkas). School pupils had to wear grey soldier-shirts while the pupils at vocational schools had to wear black shirts. The Communists in North Korea and China decreed that nearly the entire society should be uniformed. Incrcasing American Support Rockefeller paid particular attention to the build-up of the Soviet war- machine. American experts admitted that Communism was in danger again and would have collapsed if the first five-year plan had not been financcd from the United States. The Americans continued financing them also later, despite the fact that the ignorance of the Russians constantly presented new problems. American money continued to breathe life into this fragile, inefficient and brutal system, despite all the difficulties. A contract was concluded with the Ford Motor Company on the 1st of May 1930. Ford promised to spend 30 million dollars (approximately 600 million dollars today) to build up the Soviet automobile industry. And so the Americans built a Ford factory in Nizhny Novgorod, which was called the Molotov factory and had already begun producing 140 000 cars per year by 1932, including the GAZ-A (Ford-A). The freemason Henry Ford had previously made sure that the Russian workers had been given good work experience in his factories in the United States. He also donated equipment. Americans ran the factory for the first few years. Ford later built factories in Ulyanovsk, Odessa and Pavlovsk, where also tanks were produced. 10 million dollars in wages were paid to the Americans each year. The American Electric Boat Company and British and Italian compa- nies began helping the Soviet Union to build submarines in 1930. The Soviet air force was built entirely with foreign capital in the 1930s. 345"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Moscow had earlier bought aeroplanes from Germany, Britain, Italy, the United States of America and other countries. The American Seversky Aircraft Corporation began to help the Soviet air force with the building of hydroplanes in 1937. When the factory in Russia was finished, it could produce 10 seaplanes per day. The Radio Corporation of America began building up the Soviet radio and telegrapli system as early as 1927. The DuP ont Company built five chemical factories in Russia, which produced (among other things), nitric acid, necessary for the production of explosives. The Russians were often incapable of building any sophisticated factories, even though the Americans gave them detailed instructions. So the industrial builder Albert Kahn from Detroit closed a deal with Moscow in February 1930 according to which he was to build a number of industries in the Soviet Union. The total cost amounted to two billion dollars. Of the major projects the Zionist Albert Kahn carried out, I can mention the electric motor factory in Elmash in the Urals and the turbine factory in Kharkov (designed by General Electric). His closest assistants were advisers to the Soviet government for questions connected with the second five-year plan, according to Encyclopaedia Judaica. The Soviet propaganda enticed 100 000 American workers to go to Russia. Most of them were not allowed to return home. They were turned into Soviet citizens against their will. Some who began protesting and criticising Communism even ended up in prison camps. This goes to show how frightened the power-mongers were of the American public finding out any detailed information about the conditions in the Communist \"paradise\". 60 000 German workers also moved to Stalin's empire. Describing all the American projects designed to build up the false fronts of Communism would take up too much space. This will have to be enough. The international financial elite (Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Morgan, Rockefeller, the Warburgs, Dillon, Cyrus Eaton, David Kendall and others), who took such good care of the Bolsheviks, also helped Adolf Hitler to power. This is confirmed by various documents and is quite another subject. It is a myth that the leading capitalists did not know what they were doing. They knew very well why they helped all kinds of political bandits They made sure that the Soviet Union received all the necessary foreign technology. 346"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"That the resources of the Bolsheviks were enormous is also apparent when considering the fact that only a quarter of the foreign technology in the Soviet Union was actually used, due to the lack of order in the country. There were technical resources, which had to wait for ten years before being put to use. No one could use the foreign equipment for a sugar factory in the Dnepropetrovsk area, which had cost millions. Only 13 per cent of the foreign conveyor belts were used. The rest just rusted. The situation in Uzbekistan was even worse. Only two per cent of the conveyor belts, which had been sent to Uzbekistan by foreign capitalists, were used. This was revealed by Yuri Chernichenko in his article \"Who Needs a Farmers' Party and Why?\" (Literaturnaya Rossiya, 8th of March, 1991.) Stalin and Hitler had common business interests whilst they prepared to annihilate each other. Germany sold 36 aeroplanes, including 6 Heinkel He-100 fighter planes, 5 Messerschmidt Bf-llOs, two Junkers Ju-88 bombers and others to the Soviet Union, according to the trade agreement signed in connection with the Ribbentrop pact on the 23rd of August 1939. Shavrov revealed this in his history of aeroplane construction. The Soviet Union bought 22 000 tons of copper from the United States in November 1939 and then sold it to Germany. Some cargoes were taken from Mexico via Vladivostok to Germany. The Soviet Union carried on delivering its goods until just before the German attack. War Aid to Moscow It was decided in San Diego in May 1941 that Hitler would attack Stalin and not vice-versa. This would be more beneficial to the interests of the financial elite. Admiral James O. Richardson's analysis had reached the conslusion that it would be more beneficial to the U.S.A. if Hitler attacked Stalin first (Bunich, \"The Party's Gold\", St. Petersburg, 1992, p. 133). Therefore, the terrorist Bolshevik regime once more came into grave danger in the summer of 1941, when Stalin had planned an attack against Hitler (operation Thunder), although he had personally deprived the Red Army of its best commanders. The attack was to have taken place on the 6th of July 1941. This information comes from the defected GPU agent Viktor Suvorov's (Vladimir Rezun's) books \"The Ice-Breaker\" (Moscow, 1992) and \"M Day\" (Moscow, 1994). Hitler's spies had warned Berlin 347"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"about this and a counterattack plan, Barbarossa, was worked out. The plan was put into action, after certain delays, on the 22nd of June 1941, thus anticipating Stalin's planned attack by only two weeks. Stalin was surprised, in spite of the reports of his own spies. He could not understand Hitler's foolhardiness in maintaining two fronts simultaneously. He had not expected this — he even had difficulty believing the announcement of war. He saw it as a provocation. Neither had he believed the stories of a coming attack from German deserters on the previous day. It was only later in the evening that he gave the order to resist. Stalin had declared before the Central Committee already in 1925: \"If a great war breaks out in Europe, we shall not just watch. We shall take part, but among the last - to decide the fate of the war. And naturally, therefore, to pick the fruits of the war...\" In 1941, no one wanted to believe Adolf Hitler's explanations that he wished to anticipate Stalin's planned attack. Suvorov has managed to prove, with documents from German archives and open Soviet sources, that Hitler's information was correct. The High Command of the Red Army had already, on the 21st of June (the day before Hitler's attack), received orders to attack Romania on the 6th of July 1941. The commander of this operation was to have been Marshal Semyon Timoshenko. He was supposed to have travelled to Minsk on the 22nd of June to prepare the attack, in which 4.4 million men were to have been used. But the Germans attacked first. The so-called Black Divisions were formed from Russian camp prisoners, who were trained very thoroughly in Sochi and sent to fight the Germans in July- August 1941. Stalin had more paratroops for attack purposes than any other nation. Stalin had promised by Lenin's bier that he would expand the borders of the Soviet Union {Pravda, 30th of January 1924). He also had special A-tanks (Avtostradnye tanki) which could travel on German motorways. Stalin had a total of 15 000 tanks, three times more than Hitler. Suvorov quotes Marshals Georgi Zhukov, Alex ander Vasilevsky, Vasily Soko- lovsky, Nikolai Vatutin, Ivan Bagram yan and others, who all confirmed that Stalin was preparing an attack and not defence as was later claimed. This was the reason why Moscow's losses became so enormous - 600 000 men in the first three weeks, 7615 tanks, 6233 fighter planes (of which 1200 were lost on the first day) and 4423 artillery pieces. 348"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"The Jewish senator and high-ranking freemason Harry S. Truman, who became vice-president and later president of the United States explained the situation after Hitler's attack in the following way: \"If we see that Germany is about to win, we should help Russia, and if we see that Russia is winning, we should help Germany, because in this way we shall be able to let them kill as many as possible.\" But no one was allowed to risk Stalin's life, since his death would be a \"real catastrophe\". (Noam Chomsky, \"Man kan inte morda historien\" / \"You Cannot Murder History\", Gothenburg, 1995, pp. 503-504.) Did Truman fear that no other Red bandit chieftain would be able to murder Russians as efficiently? Truman could sate his lust for murder in August 1945 when he had atom bombs dropped on two cultural centres of Japan. Gore Vidal reveals, in his introduction to Professor Israel Shahak's book \"Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years\" (London, 1994), that Truman received two million dollars \"support\" from a Zionist when he came to run for president in 1948. A large number of Russian soldiers le t themselves be taken prisoner. By the end of the first year, 3.8 million had gone over to the Germans. The Red Army simply refused to fight for the cause of Communism. Most of the remaining 1.2 million was killed in action. Joseph Stalin became frightened. On the 24th of August 1941, Radio Moscow encouraged international Jewry to help the Soviet Union wholeheartedly in its moment of need. It is therefore understandable that the financiers of Wall Street were seized with panic and began sending all kinds of equipment to the Sovict Union as quickly as they could. In August 1941 the United States began to confer with Moscow about how Hitler's troops could most effectively be repulsed. The United States meanwhile continued to give the Nazis military and economic aid, but on a smaller scale. Equipment immediately began to be sent to the Soviet Union. The United States also demanded that Stalin temporarily \"forget\" Communist slogans and anti-Russian propaganda. He had to open the churches, release priests and even allow a certain amount of religious freedom (the cor- responding demand from president Roosev elt was relayed to Stalin by Father Brown, the Catholic priest at the American Embassy in Moscow). Washington also wanted the Soviet Union to begin using the old tsarist army uniforms. Stalin had to comply with this. The new uniforms were sewn in the United States in 1941-43. The Soviet army wore the tsarist 349"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"army soldier-shirts until 1970. A patriotic Russian song, \"The Holy War\" - which had rallied the Tsar's soldiers in the First World War, was also exploited. The Soviet Union, the United States of America and Great Britain signed the preliminary protocol concerning military aid in Moscow on the 1st of October 1941, following which 400 aeroplanes, 500 tanks, artillery pieces and other munitions were immediately sent to the Soviet Union. One of those involved in this deal was Henry Ford. Stalin asked for barbed wire on the 1st of October 1941 and 4 000 tons of barbed wire were sent to the Soviet Union on the 10th of October. The Soviet Union's war production increased 25 times over during the four years of the war. A significant part of the American aid came in the form of food. 4 291 012 tons of preserves, sugar, salt, nuts, tea, fruit and other foodstuffs, including vitamins were sent to the Soviet Union between the 1st of October 1941 and the 31st of May 1945. A total of 782 973 tons of tinned meat were sent to Moscow. In 1945 the shops stocked 46 times more canned meat than they did in 1940. Stalin became frightened when he saw how rapidly the Germans were advancing (they had already reached Minsk by the sixth day of the war). He fled from Moscow in the autumn of 1941. Two and a half million Jews were moved, by order of Stalin, from the invaded areas towards the central regions of the Soviet Union where they immediately began dealing on the black market. (Isaac Deutscher, \"The Un-Jewish Jew\", Stockholm, 1969, pp. 96-97.) Stalin was prepared to make peace with Hitler in October 1941. He wanted to give the Germans the Baltic states, Byelorussia, Moldavia (Bessarabia), a part of the Ukraine (Bukovina) and the Karelian Isthmus. General Nikolai Pavlenkov revealed this in the spring of 1989 in the newspaper Moskovskyie Novosti. The people's commissary for interior affairs, Lavrenti Beria, was given the task of beginning peace negotiations with Hitler, through his agent Stamenov, who was the Bulgarian ambassador. Hitler refused to negotiate with Moscow. All this is proved by documents, which Dmitri Volkogonov presented in Izvestiya on the 9th of May 1993. President Truman wanted to justify his aid to the Communist Party, so he turned to his Jewish friend Jack Warner in Hollywood and ordered a propaganda film, \"Mission to Moscow\", which praised Stalinism. The film was completed in 1943. The Soviet propaganda later claimed that all the 350"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"advances in the war against the Nazis were due to the heroism of the Sovict people. Fortunes of the war turned, thanks to American aid, and things began to look brighter to Stalin, who used this opportunity to proclaim a holy war of Communism. In Yalta he was giv en free hands to occupy new areas and countries in Eastern Europe. The Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia admits: \"It was decided that Konigsberg and its surrounding area should be handed over to the Soviet Union.\" The former intelligence agent Douglas Bazata admitted in the autumn of 1979 in Washington that his chief, Donovan, had paid him 800 dollars extra to stop General Patton's advance in France in 1943. Bazata did this in August 1944, when Patton and his troops were close to Dijon. Patton had been far too successful and would have ended the war far too early. Dcspite the fact that the American General George Patton later managed to liberate large parts of Czechoslovakia, he was given a sharp ordcr by the Commander-in-Chief Dwight Eisenhower (1890-1969), a high-ranking freemason, to leave Czechoslovakia to the Red Army. Patton unwillingly complied and with a heavy heart withdrew his troops from Czechoslovakia. When Patton's Third Army was prepared to enter Berlin, all the petrol was suddenly withdrawn - the intention was to stop him from reaching Berlin before the Russians. After this he was given orders to attack - many American soldiers died in vain. Patton could have ended the war nine months earlier. In this way, the Russians were given the opportunity to take Berlin, Prague and Vienna first. The Soviet Union took the chance to also occupy Rumania, despite their separate peace with this country. After this, Gencral Patton proclaimed all the more eagerly that the real enemy of the USA was in Moscow and that the Amer icans should continue their battle against the East instead, in order to free the enslaved peoples of the Soviet Union. Patton became too difficult for the high-ranking freemasons. He also wanted to use German troops to crush the Communists in Moscow. For this reason, it became necessary to dispose of Patton in 1945. Bazata was paid to kill Patton. But he warned the general instead. Another agent was then used to be on the safe side. He made several attempts which all failed. In the autumn of 1945, General Patton was the victim of a mysterious car accident (a lorry ran into his car) in Germany (Bavaria). In connection with this accident, the agent attempted to shoot 351"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Patton with a metal projectile from a specially produced weapon. Patton was wounded. Despite the fact that the general was paralysed, he began to recover in hospital. At that point he was poisoned with a new kind of potassium cyanide. Patton died on 21 December 1945 after a long spell in hospital. The White House is considered to be behind all these crimes. The murderer himself has related this to Bazata. Bazata was tested with a lie detector. He was considered to be telling the truth. {The Spotlight, 22 October 1979.) The Western powers also handed more than two million war refugees over to Stalin. It was well known what fate awaited them. No mistakes were made. Some of those who had managed to escape from Soviet Russia in the 1920s and had already become Western citizens were also handed over. The 76-year-old general of the reserve, Piotr Krasnov, who was a German citizen, was sent back to the Soviet Union. He was executed in Moscow on the 17th of January 1947, according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia. The case of Krasnov is the most infamous example of America's betrayal of the anti-Communists. The British extradited the legendary White General Andrei Shkuro to Stalin. He had received the Order of Bath from King George V for his services to Britain. The freemason Harold Macmillan also sent back 70 000 Cossacks who had found their way to the West. All information about them was classified. Many documents disappeared without trace. The historian Nikolai Tolstoy in England revealed this. The BBC was not allowed to mention his book \"The Minister and the Massacres\", which deals with this dirty business. The Cossacks resisted but the British used gross assault to deliver them in May of 1945. Most of them were killed with their families It was later revealed that the initiative had come from the freemason Anthony Eden. (Nikolai Tolstoy, \"Victims of Yalta\".) The Yugoslavian dictator Josip Tito (actually Broz), whose closest aides were the Jew Moses Pijade and Aleksander Rankovic (Rankau, who led the red terror as minister of the interior) also had his deserters returned to him. Many events become significantly clearer when viewed from a histo- rical perspective. British agents helped to topple the Yugoslavian govern ment on the 27th of March 1941. A new leadership, with the freemason General and the freemason Richard D. Simovic at the head, immediately began to co-operate with Stalin, signing a pact of friendship on the 5th of 352"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"April. London funded Tito intensively during the entire Second World War and later helped him to power. After the war, Tito received massive support from the West to build up Communism. Without that support his regime would have collapsed immediately. His crimes were concealed at the same time. The United States alone sent Tito 35 billion dollars in secret aid between 1948 and 1965. An expert on international law, Smilja Avramov, revealed this to a Serbian newspaper, Politika Ekspres, in an interview, published January 16, 1989. That support for Tito covered 60 per cent of the expenses of the Communist regime. Smilja Avramov stressed: \"Our regime would never have survived without that economic aid.\" The American aid to Yugoslavia is an important state secret, which the American Embassy in Belgrade refused to comment upon. The contributions of Western private banks became an even better kept secret. The West delivered lists of all captured soldiers who had demanded political asylum. They were executed immediately upon their return to the Soviet Union. Other Soviet soldiers who had been prisoners of war were sent to special prison camps. President Boris Yeltsin's military adviser, General Dmitri Volkogonov, discovered Stalin's instructions to build a large number of prison camps with a capacity of ten thousand prisoners each. This was where these poor soldiers were sent. It was a Swedish state secret how nearly a thousand imprisoned Russian soldiers were sent from Gavle on two ships, under the strictest secrecy, to certain death in the Soviet Union on the 10th of October 1944. They had had enough of the war and decided to escape to Sweden. This was revealed only in the spring of 1992 by the historian Dr Anders Berge in his book \"Flyktingpolitik i stormakts skugga, Sverige och de sovjetryska fan- garna under andra varldskriget\" / \"Refugee Policy in the Shadow of a Super Power, Sweden and the Soviet-Russian Prisoners during the Second World War\" (Uppsala, 1992). According to Berge, Moscow also deman- ded the addresses of the Russian prisoners who had been granted residence permit in Sweden. The Swedish government co-operated and made lists available to the Soviet Embassy. This was espionage at a high level. Communist agents were immediately sent out to begin working on those refugees. Berge states that Sweden \"gave Soviet officials plenty of authority... to subject the unco-operative to persuasion, disinformation, threats and other methods\". This resulted in another 180 Russians returning to the Soviet 353"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Union. Less than half- 1750 - of the refugees the Soviet Union wanted returned were eventually given political asylum in Sweden. It was an irony of fate that Stalin had allowed the NKVD to co-operate and share their experiences with the Gestapo. The NKVD and the Gestapo even executed people together. The historian Nikolai Tolstoy also revealed those pre-war actions. Foreign Slaves in the Soviet Union Until recently, it has been concealed from the public that the Soviet Union also used hundreds of thousands of foreign slaves for various rebuilding projects after the Second World War. Millions of new slaves were needed. That was why new slave camps for foreigners were built with the silent approval of Western leaders. A rev ealing film about these slaves was released in France in 1995 \"Foreign Slaves in the GULAG\". Whilst the West celebrated the victory, an order came from Moscow to the Soviet zone in Germany, commanding the NKVD and Smersh (Death to the spies!) to imprison any foreigners in the zone. Among those arrested were Italians, Frenchmen, Poles and others who had worked in the German war industry, and foreign (including many Russian) refugees. Many allied prisoners of war, who had been held in German prison camps, also became Soviet slaves. Of course, many German prisoners of war were also enslaved. In this way, hundreds of thousands of innocent foreigners were captured during a short period of time. Western governments declared those people \"missing\" or \"deserted\". They wanted to conceal the real circumstances from the public. An American citizen, John Noble, was among those captured in Dresden on the 5th of July 1945. The fact that he had Swiss diplomatic immunity did not save him or his family. The Gestapo had held his family under house arrest during the war and John had been waiting eagerly for the Soviet \"liberators\". He was quickly disillusioned, however, since the Red soldiers began murdering, raping and looting in Dresden and in other towns. The American authorities did not listen to John Noble's cry for help. In the beginning he sat with other foreigners, doctors, lawyers and businessmen and their wives and children, in a prison where all the prisoners were tortured. Some of them were shot in the neck because they 354"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"were not physically strong enough fo r slave labour. The foreigners had been caught in raids on their houses, in institutions and in the streets. The captured foreigners were taken to concentration camps. What hap- pened after the war in these concentration camps, including those in Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen has been completely ignored by the history books. Many of the terrible crimes committed in those camps were later blamed on the Nazis. John Noble stated that 10 000 people from different nations died as a result of malnutrition during a single year at Buchenwald. He had discovered this from Soviet documents whilst wor- king the camp's office. The prisoners' governments had betrayed and forgotten them. Those crimes were also committed to smooth the way for the expansion of Communism. The fates of those individuals were un- interesting. Foreign citizens in those Communist prison camps in Germany were chargcd with \"anti-Soviet activities\". John Noble received a sentence of 15 years in a slave camp in Vorkuta. It was thought to be a destination with no return. The foreign prisoners were transported to the Soviet Union under strict secrecy. The Western political leaders were informed about this but kept quiet. In Vorkuta, there were a total of half a million slaves who worked in 40 coalmines, in cement and brick factories. A coal miner's average pro- duction was 17 tons of coal per shift, a totally inhuman amount. Six-seven people died each day. Their corpses were thrown into a mass grave. 15 per cent of the prisoners were women and children. Among the slaves were Americans, Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Estonians, Finns, Englishmen, Japanese, Italians and others. Only the strongest survived. After Stalin's death, General Maslennikov came to Vorkuta to find out what the prisoners really thought about their lives there. No one would be punished for what they said. There was no one who dared to say a word about the matter. The general continued to encourage the prisoners. Finally, a score of men, including a former professor of history from Leningrad, stepped forward. The ex-professor said: \"I shall speak, even though I know I shall be given another ten years of slave labour here for what I have to say.\" Maslennikov assured him no such thing would happen to him. The professor then summarised slavery through the ages and finished by commenting on the slavery in the Soviet Union: \"Never before has any 355"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"slavery been as cruel and inhuman.\" The professor was not given another ten years of hard labour — he was shot immediately. John Noble managed, with great difficulty, to smuggle a postcard to his parents in Detroit. They turned to President Eisenhower, who was forced to ask Moscow to release John Nobl e. He was finally released in 1955. Nikita Khrushchev released over 200 000 foreigners from 45 countries from the slave camps. The release of foreign slaves ceased in 1964 when he was deposed. After the fall of Communism, the KGB files on foreign slaves in the Soviet Union were finally opened. It was shown that the security police had managed to capture 57 238 foreigners, including Englishmen, Yugo- slavs, Frenchmen, Poles, Romanians, Iranians, Afghanis, Chinese, Japa- nese, Koreans, Turks, Danes and Belgians, in 1950 alone. A Swiss had also been kidnapped and taken to the Soviet Union. Many foreigners had been arrested while visiting Moscow. The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg was the most famous person to be captured by the Soviet Union. He was kidnapped in Budapest on the 17th of January 1945 and taken to Moscow, where they tried to recruit him as an agent. Wallenberg refused. He was then murdered by two Jewish Chekists - Colonels Grigori Mairanovsky and Dmitri Kopelyansky - withi an injection of poison. This was revealed by the Jewish publicist and free- mason Arkadi Vaksberg in Svenska Dagbladet on December 13, 1995. He thought it an irony of fate that Jews finally murdered Wallenberg, who had saved the lives of many Jews. It has now been revealed that the Swedish Legation in Budapest had also helped German and Italian National Socialists to escape from the Red Army with false passports. The Swedish Foreign Ministry classified this information in 1952. Not even the officials at the American Embassy were safe - some ended up as slaves. The 22-year-old Alex Dolgun was kidnapped while strolling along a street in Moscow in December 1948. He worked at the Embassy Alex was born in New York and was an American citizen. His father was an engineer who had been fooled by the Soviet propaganda and went to Russia together with tens of thousands of other naive Americans in 1933 to help with the build-up of the Communist industry. He was not allowed to leave the country after his contract had run out. He was regarded as a Soviet citizen against his will and was drafted into the Red Army during World War Two. His son Alex was charged with \"anti-Soviet activity and 356"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" espionage\" and sent to a slave camp. He was released in 1956, in con- nection with Khrushchev's amnesty. Alex was not allowed to leave the Sovict Union, despite the fact that his sister in New York regularly sent invitations. Thanks to his sister's efforts he finally escaped the Red hell in 1971. (Alexander Dolgun and Patrick Watson, \"Alexander Dolgun's Story. An American in Gulag\", 1975.) The most difficult thing those people had to accept was the fact that their own embassies did not care about their fate, although many signals werc smuggled to them. They were also mentally strained by the fact that they were held in slave camps whereas they were quite innocent. Moreover, they were depressed by being forced to live in a foreign country and obey orders in a foreign language. Some of the foreigners, who were unsuitable for physical labour, were also executed in the Soviet Union. The former KGB Colonel Kirillin confirmed that 7000 foreigners had been shot in the village of Butovo (on the so-called Polygon) near Moscow. Documents reveal that over 60 000 foreigners, including Finns and Romanians, were taken to Pechora in Komi. President Boris Yeltsin ordered these sensitive documents classified once again. Lenin had, during his time in power, decided that the spine of the Soviet system would be comprised of slave labour. He laid down the slaves' work averages and food rations. He had even decided how many victims were to die. A previously unknown order signed by Lenin in 1919 was shown in the French documentary film mentioned above. \"Publication prohibited!\" had been written on it. This amazing order stated that all \"useless\" foreigners were to be sent to the concentration camps. Stalin's Holy War In 1936, Stalin fought a \"holy war\" also in Spain. Moscow sent the Spanish Communists 648 aeroplanes, 347 tanks, 60 armoured vehicles, 1186 artillery pieces and 3000 Soviet military experts between 1936 and 1939. The total support amounted to 274 million roubles (50 million dollars), according to the periodical Vikerkaar No. 1, 1986. The financial elite suddenly changed their plans and the Soviet (i.e. the American) aid to the Republic was withdrawn in the autumn of 1938. Therefore, Franco 357"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"was able to take Madrid on the 28th of March 1939. Nearly 1.4 million people were killed in the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish gold reserve of 600 million dollars (the fourth largest in the world) was handed over to Moscow in order to keep it out of Franco's reach. Moscow kept the gold. Two Italian Stalinists, Carlo and Nello Roselli, had planned a revolution in Venice for the 25th of May 1937, where they were to have led the attack of 2600 terrorists and thereby provoked a civil war. Stalin suddenly decided to cancel this operation and prohibited the Roselli brothers from taking action in Italy. The Communist brothers ignored the ban, however. The NKVD then organised the murder of the two brothers with the aid of a right-wing group, according to the historian Franco Bandini's book \"The Cone of the Shadow\" (1990). Bandini declared to the newspaper Il Tempo (Rome,), on the 11th of April 1990: \"The lobby of historians has tried to silence every unpleasant piece of information during the last 45 years. They considered documents of this nature as their own private property. They worked only to conceal the unpleasant truth.\" The holy war reached Poland on the 17th of September 1939. Finland was attacked on November 30th in the same year. But Moscow was forced to cease its war against Finland on March 12, 1940 - it had become too expensive (the Soviet side had already lost 250 000 out of a million men) Stalin said to Churchill in 1943: \"A nation which has fought so intensely for its independence is worthy of respect.\" Stalin changed his mind in 1948 when he said, according to the witness Milovan Djilas: \"It was wrong not to occupy Finland.\" (Helsingin Sanomat, 16th of March 1983.) In the summer of 1940 it was time to introduce Communism into the Baltic states and Bessarabia (Moldavia). The flowering economies of the Baltic states were a very negative advertisement for their eastern neigh- bour and for this reason the countries had to disappear. Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had a turnover of 586 474 000 dollars on the world market in 1938 while the gigantic Soviet Union's turnover was only 512 508 000 dollars. (J. Bokalders, \"The International Yearbook\", Riga. 1944.) England broke off its negotiations with Stalin concerning the Ball in- states. The financial elite decided that Germany should \"deliver\" the Baltic states and Finland to the Soviet Union. Stalin understood, during the negotiations in London, that he would be permitted to occupy the 358"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Baltic states. President Roosevelt was well informed about the secret additions to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact the day after it was signed. This is evident from a secret telegram (71.6211/93). He made no outward sign, but continued to play the role of the naive and \"well-meaning\" Western leader. He never warned the Baltic states, since it was also to the interests of the United States that those nations should disappear from the map. When the Red Army had occupied Estonia, Franklin Delano Roosevelt cynically said to the journalists: \"If the Estonians don't like Communism they can leave Estonia!\" Roosevelt knew very well whom he was dealing with. His judgement of Stalin shows this. When Felix Habsburg visited the White House, Roose- velt asked: \"Felix, have you ever met the devil?\" Felix Habsburg did not understand what he meant by this. Roosevelt continued: \"Felix, I have met the devil. He was in Yalta and his name was Stalin.\" (Erich Feigl, \"Kaiserin Zita\", Vienna, 1977, pp. 226-227.) It should be pointed out here that the United States continued to aid Moscow up to and during the Finnish Winter War, in spite of Roosevelt's promise that Stalin would receive no support for the attack on Finland (there was officially an embargo against the Soviet Union). Three hundred firms in fifteen states sent their goods to the Pacific from where it was sent on to Vladivostok. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, supplied Germany with grain, oil and other raw materials, which were needed for the war operations against Western Europe in the spring and summer of 1940. Within 17 months Ger- many received 865 million tons of oil, 14 000 tons of copper, 1 million tons of timber, 11 000 tons of flax, 15 000 tons of asbestos, 184 000 tons of phosphates, 2736 kilograms of platinum, 1462 million tons of grain, and more, from Moscow. In November of 1939 alone, the Soviet Union had bought 22 000 tons of copper from the United States and sold it at a profit to Germany. The Finns allied themselves with the Germans in the summer of 1941 and took back the areas the Soviet Union had occupied. Stalin asked Great Britain for help. And indeed - Great Britain declared war on Finland in Novemember 1941. They immediately sent 500 fighter planes, 280 armoured vehicles and 3000 lorries to Arkhangelsk. The sensible Finnish com- mander-in-chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, broke away from the German forces and continued operating on his own. He wanted to 359"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"recapture all the areas Finland had lost during the Winter War of 1939-40. Not even Peter the Great could defeat the Swedish King Charles XII without secret aid from England. The United States of America did not want to declare war on Finland directly, but in the summer of 1942 the Americans closed their consulates in Finland and demanded that Helsinki also close its consulates in the United States. The Soviet Union attacked once more on the 9th of June 1944, this time with American weapons, but Finland managed to resist. Washington was infuriated. The United States broke off their diplomatic relations with Finland on June 30th, 1944 to force the little country to steer a more Soviet-friendly course. Finland continued to defend itself. Moscow had the impudence to demand 300 million dollars \"damages\" from Finland when the Continuation War finished in September 1944. The French historian Raymond Cartier has made an interesting study, comparing Hitler's armaments to the equipment, which the United States sent to Stalin. Germany, in its attack against the Soviet Union, used 1280 aeroplanes, 3330 armoured vehicles and 600 000 cars. In comparison, the United States sent the following to the Soviet Union during the nine month period from the 1st of October 1941 to June 1942: 1285 aeroplanes, 2249 armoured vehicles, 81 289 automatic weapons, 30 million kilograms of explosives, 36 825 cars, 56 445 field telephones and other equipment. During the entire war, the United States sent a total of 376 000 vehicles (including 45 000 \"Willis\" jeeps and 29 000 motorcycles), 29 000 loco- motives, 12 536 tanks, 17 834 aeroplanes, 130 500 automatic weapons, 240 000 tons of explosives and ammunition, 13 200 revolvers, 2.5 million tons of petrol and other war materials. Here I can mention that American cars made up two thirds of the Red Army's total supply, and that another 43 494 cars were sent from Great Britain. The Red Army received a total of 419 494 cars and other vehicles. Only 120 000 cars were produced in the Soviet Union between 1942 and 1944 - thus over three times less than they received from the West. Neither did they have any trouble with uniforms, because the United States had 34 million uniforms, including the tsarist army shirts, sewn with Singer sewing machines. America also delivered 50 million metres of woollen cloth. The tank drivers wore American overalls. This information comes from Keesen's \"Archiv der Gegenwart\" (Part XV, 1945, p. 76) among other sources. 360"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The Communists received a total of 17.8 million tons of goods worth 10.8 billion dollars from America. Of course, Moscow was unable to repay more than a tiny part of this. In January 1951 the U.S.A. wanted 84 war-ships worth 800 million dollars returned but Stalin refused categorically. It is obvious that Moscow would never have survived Hitler's attack without American aid. As proof of this claim I will point to the fact that the Soviet Union lacked heavy bombers. Only 79 of the Pe-8, the Soviet Union's only four-engine aeroplane, were ever produced. 50 000 similar aeroplanes were produced in Great Britain and the United States during the same period. The Soviet bomber 11-4 was considered an inferior aeroplane. Aid During the \"Cold War\" The United States continued to build up the Soviet Union even during the so-called cold war. The West continued to deal with the East militarily as well as economically. Antony Sutton confirms that the build-up of the Soviet steel industry was completed by Fretz-Moon, Aetna Standard, Mannesman and other American companies. Two thirds of the Soviet merchant navy, which in 1970 amounted to 6000 ships, were built outside the Soviet Union. Four fifths of the marine engines were also built outside the Soviet Empire. The rest were built with Western help. Congress while appropriating billions for defence against Communism has at the same time given over six billion dollars in direct military and economic aid to the Communists. Radar-equipped F-86 jet fighter planes worth over 300 000 dollars each have been sold to the Communist dictator of Yugoslavia for 10 000 dollars. The Eisenhower Administration approved it. (\"Report, U.S. Foreign Assistance\", U.S. Agency for Int. Dev., March 21, 1962.) The entire Soviet automobile industry came from the West, primarily from the United States. Moscow used 30 000 heavy transport vehicles to move its missiles and other war materials, all of which were produced with American aid. Ford Motor Company built a gigantic lorry factory in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod) in 1968. 361"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Gleason, New Britain Machine Company and TRW of Cleveland in the United States delivered the equipment for Fiat's car industry in Togliatti. The Americans also built the world's largest lorry factory in Kama in the 1970s. Information about which companies besides Ford took part was classified by the State Department. 1200 foreigners worked with the installations of the factory, which had a full production capacity on 150 000 three-axled lorries and 250 000 diesel motors per year. As a result of the Soviet lack of skill, only 41 000 lorries were produced in the Kama factory up to 1978. The Kama company had great military significance. Other documents prove that Arthur Brandt Company of Detroit, Michigan, built the car factory ZIL. The Chase Manhattan Bank gave 192 million dollars for this project. Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin confirmed at the end of 1965 that \"the mechanisation was completed much too slowly\". In some cases the delays amounted to four years or more. Over 100 000 building projects were unfinished as a result. Not even the United States could help the Soviet Union this time. Only 676 000 tractors of the 2 762 200 in the Soviet Union between 1966 and 1974 worked properly. The others were quite inferior. (Charles Levinson, \"Vodka-Cola\", Essex, 1979, p. 127.) Only 30 per cent of 10 000 combine harvesters were actually delivered in 1964. The Soviet T-54 tank is suspiciously similar to the American Christie tank. One might suspect the Communists of having stolen the model and copied it. It was actually simpler than that. The U.S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation produced the tanks for Moscow. During Gorbachev's time in power (1985-91) the Soviet Union produced twice as many tanks as the United States of America did during Reagan's presidency (1981-1988). 3300 tanks were produced in the Soviet Union in 1986, 3500 in 1987, and again in 1988. Thousands of other armoured vehicles were also produced in the Soviet Union during the same time. There were a total of 53 000 tanks in the Soviet empire. That, to put things in perspective, was three times more than NATO had. In 1966 France gave a guarantee to finance the building of chemical industries for 3.5 billion francs. Moscow also received 1.5 billion francs to build the Renault car factory by the Kama River in 1971 and another 800 million francs for the building of a paper-mill. In 1988 the billionaire Armand Hammer invested six billion dollars in the building of chemical 362"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"factories in the Soviet Union. The Jewish capitalist Robert Maxwell, drowned under mysterious circumstances in 1991, also had an intensive co-operation with Moscow. 80 per cent of all the goods delivered to the Soviet Union were bought on credit. (Charles Levinson, \"Vodka-Cola\", Essex, 1979, p. 26.) Many intelligent Russians found it hard to understand why the Americans did not put an end to Communism. Meanwhile, the KGB in the Soviet Union and its satellite states had to follow secret instructions to the effect that no one was permitted to introduce any new inventions, which increased production. Those instructions were revealed only in the summer of 1990. Antony Sutton emphasised that the Russians would never have been able to carry out their space program, Soyuz, without the help of the United States. Thousands of captured German rocket experts were sent to the Soviet Union and the first Russian sputnik was propelled into space by German rockets, which had been further developed. The Soviet Union's own contributions to space research were generally just a big bluff, as the defected journalist Leonid Vladimirov proved quite clearly. The Swedish daily Expressen revealed on the 21st of January 1985that high technology had been smuggled into the Soviet Union via France, in spite of the American embargo against the Kremlin. This made it possible to continue the co-operation in space. American presidents had classified a pact of this nature with France. NASA was responsible for smuggling modern electronic equipment into the Soviet Union. The United States of America had 5000 computers at the end of the 1950s, while the Soviet Union only had 120. In 1973 the United States had 70 000 and the Soviet Union 6000 - the Soviet computers were all of the first or second generation. The American computers could manage 2500 operations per second in the Second World War and 15 000 in the 1950s. IBM and the British company International Computer and Tabulation Ltd. began supplying the Soviet Union with their computers. The activities of the Soviet research institutes and so-called letterbox factories were strictly secret. In that way the Soviet Union concealed from the public the fact that it was lagging behind in the field of technological development and that some projects originated from abroad. Those in the West who were interested could read in various books about what was happening in these institutions. 363"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"The Soviet Union's military expenses amounted to 35 per cent of its GNP (compared to 5.5 per cent in the United States and 2.5 per cent in Sweden). The White House in Washington and Wall Street in New York continued to support the Soviet syst em despite officially condemning Moscow's invasion of Afghanistan. An agreement to develop Soviet agriculture was signed as late as the 18th of June 1985. Young American farmers were sent to the Soviet Union to train Russian kolkhoz functio- naries. Modern technology was also delivered. (The International Herald Tribune, 19th June 1985.) At the same time, Moscow sent aid to all the other Communist countries. Nicaragua alone received 294 million dollars during three years. Moscow sent 300 million dollars each month to support the Communist regime in Kabul. The Dismantling of the Soviet Union Only one conclusion can be drawn from all of this: the United States of America could have ruined the Soviet Union whenever they wanted to. They would only have needed to stop delivering modern equipmenl. Washington continued. The United States could have defeated the Vietna mese Communists easily. But they did not want to. On the contrary modern American war equipment was del ivered to the Viet Cong. And more than 58 000 young American men were sacrificed. All this served the purposes of the financial elite (and the United States had the opportunity to experiment with various bacteriological and chemical weapons). The financial elite wanted to keep the Vietnam War going at any cost. It was a perfect cover for the profitable narcotics trade, according to Dr Alfred W. McCoy. Several American researchers, including Richard Pipes of Harvard, have pointed out that the Americans only needed to stop sending their aid to overthrow the Communists in Moscow. Antony Sutton emphasised in a lecture to the leadership of the Republican Party that this efficient weapon had, for some reason, never been used. If the aid had been withdrawn, they would have saved millions of people from the most terrible suffering and furthered the cause of democracy. The aid to the Soviet Union and its satellite states was concealed in many different ways, mostly by loans at incredibly low interest rates. It 364"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"was well-known that Moscow could not even afford to pay the interest on these loans. Repayment was not expected. In 1984 alone, the Soviet block receivcd loans totalling 50 billion dollars at the same time as modern technology was delivered free of charge. (Det Basta, October 1985.) In 1984 the Soviet Union owed the Western banks 136.7 billion dollars, including 28.7 billion owed to various private banks. (Svenska Dagbladet, 4th May 1985.) Despite this, \"loans\" amounting to 200 million dollars were received from the First National Bank of Chicago while Morgan Guaranty, the Bankers Trust and the Irving Trust gave the Soviet Union another 200 million dollars at an especially low rate of interest. These loans were without securities and the borrower was supposed to have begun repaying them six years later. The borrower was allowed to use the money for anything whatever - as if the Soviet Union was the banks' best customer. The newly opened archives have revealed that Moscow made var illegal money transfers to Communist parties all around the world. Moreover, some goods were sold to the Soviet Union at a much lower price than on the world market. The Western taxpayers had to pay the difference. In this way the EEC \"sold\" 100 000 tons of butter to the Soviet Union for approximately 45 pfennigs per kilogram while the German consumer had to pay over 10 DM per kilogram (100 pfennigs = 1 DM). Another 100 000 tons of butter were later \"sold\" to the Soviet Union at the highcr price of 70 pfennigs per kilogram. Everything according to Expressen, 8th of August 1987. In the years 1984-1986, the Soviet Union lost approximately 8 billion dollars in yearly oil-profits (though the volume of exports was roughly the same) as a result of the fall in price. This should be compared with the nation's total exports, which amounted to 20-25 billion dollars. In 1989 the Soviet Union managed to scrape together only 18 billion dollars' worth of exports (mainly consisting of oil, gold and weapons). A third of the export capital in 1990 was spent on grain. Other goods also had to be imported. The Soviet Union's imports paid for in Western currencies increascd by 23 per cent in 1989 while its income of the same currencies increased only by 7-8 per cent. The satellite states and third world countries, in turn, owed the Soviet Union 85 billion dollars, which they could not repay. The Soviet budget deficit in 1989 was 100 billion roubles, making up 25 per cent of the bud- get. In the spring of 1990 the Soviet Union faced an acute currency crisis, 365"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"the annual growth rate had decreased to two per cent, the galloping inflation was at least 23 per cent and there was a shortage of all kinds of consumer goods. Strikes made the situation worse. Moscow received new loans amounting to 14 billion dollars from private banks in Germany, France, Italy, Japan and other countries at the end of 1990, according to the Moscow business newspaper Kommersant (November 26, 1990). In spite of the very low prices, the Soviet Union came to owe many countries vast amounts of money for necessary commodities. Moscow owed the German banks 37.6 billion DEM by the end of 1991 (Svenska Dagbladet, 27th of November 1991). Various Japanese companies were owed a total of 200 million dollars by Moscow in 1996. The Soviet Union had outstanding debts for various goods from different Western companies, which amounted to almost 10 billion dollars in the spring of 1990. The Soviet citizens were tired of nourishing their parasites. That was why they just pretended to work. The United States tried to keep the Soviet Union above water in all kinds of ways. Washington sent aid worth 15 billion dollars to the Soviet Union in 1991 (Moscow was not required to repay this). Wall Street calculated that Moscow would need loans of 30 billion dollars per year to cover its most vital needs. But they received only half of this. Several Western companies helped to finance the Soviet propaganda on Moscow Central Television by advertising goods, which were virtually impossible to obtain in the Soviet Union. Intelligent people in the Soviet empire realised that the capitalists had no intention of allowing them to live a normal life, since they constantly sent more aid to the Soviet Union and thereby prolonged the suffering of its citizens. Why was the Soviet Union finally made to fall? It became increasingly difficult for the United States to support the Soviet empire, as appeared from facts given in Dagens Nyheter on the 13th of July 1991. America did not have enough money to cover even its own expenses. The American government owed 4000 billion dollars to private banks in 1992. Meanwhile, the budget deficit in 1992 had increased to 285 billion dollars (Svenska Dagbladet, 30th of October 1992). Voice of America declared in August 1987 that American banks were then lending the Soviet Union and other Communist states at least 33 million dollars per day (1 billion per month). The Secretary of State, 366"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Alexander Haig, complained: \"We are lucky if we get back 25 cents for every dollar.\" German, British and French private banks alone pumped over 11 billion dollars into the Soviet Union during the first ten months of 1988. Voice of America proclaimed already in August 1988 that not even the entire tax revenue of the West could save the inefficient Soviet economy. The CIA had also systematic ally overestimated the survival power of the Soviet economy. It was stated that the CIA made serious errors in its analysis of the development of the Soviet Union, according to Svenska Dagbladet, 5th of November 1989. There was only one way out - Russia had to change to a market economy. Every future possibility of credit now became completely dependent on this condition. This was also underlined in Budapest by the important Jewish freemason Jacques Attali, director of the European Bank of Reconstruction: \"If any problems should arise with democracy, or if the government is unable to continue its present policy, we will stop the aid immediately.\" {Dagens Nyheter, 14th of April 1992.) Attali, a member of B'nai B'rith, was regarded as a grey eminence behind the freemason Francois Mitterand, then president of France. Western banks made a plot to undermine the Soviet economy in the beginning of 1991 in order to speed up the phasing-out of the Soviet Union. They flooded the country with worthless roubles and thereby caused hyperinflation with the int ention of deposing Gorbachev. Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov revealed this on the 13th of February 1991 in the newspaper Trud. This huge flow of money into the Soviet Union had been well prepared. Banks in Austria, Switzerland, Canada and Russia joined in the operation. President Mikhail Gorbachev was disturbing the develop- mcnt towards a market economy and so doing stood in the way of the financial elite. The Soviet Union tried to protect itself by taking all 50 and 100 rouble notes out of circulation. This was proclaimed to the nation by the news programme Vremya on Moscow Television at 9 PM on the 22nd of January 1991. Ordinary people were permitted to exchange their old currency for new, but only a sum equal to their monthly wage, not exceeding 1000 roubles. The state collected 40 billion roubles' worth of those notes out of a total of 48 billion. This is an example of how certain forces can provide for themselves when empires break up. The public never got to know about another, still more decisive, secret manoeuvre performed by the financial ci rcles to dismantle the Soviet 367"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Union. In 1991, between 14 and 19 billion dollars in foreign currency were taken out of the Soviet Union. As a result, production sank drastically. (Noam Chomsky, \"You Cannot Murder History\", Gothenburg, 1995, p. 511.) This action immediately ruined the Soviet Union, since 79 per cent of the workforce worked, in one way or another, in the war industry, which constantly needed foreign currency. Even the Tsar's wines were sold at various auctions in the 1980s. 13 000 bottles of Massandra wine, as well as 62 other bottles which had belonged to the cabinet office, were sold at Sotheby's in London in March 1990. These bottles of wine were worth nearly a million dollars. They fetched a price of 280 dollars per bottle in 1987. The gold and diamond supply had also been significantly reduced in order to pay running bills already in the 1980s. President George Bush informed Mikhail Gorbachev on 27 May 1991 that 150 million dollars had been transferred to the latter's bank account in Switzerland. Gorbachev used to call President Bush \"my friend George\". All this is evident from an interview with the KGB general N. Leontiev. The interview was published in Komsomolskaya Pravda on 26 December 1995. Gorbachev had forbidden his telephone conversations with Bush to be tapped. The KGB tapped and recorded all the conversations anyway. The Soviet leaders made a secret pact with the United States after the collapse of the Soviet Empire, according to which the most important pieces of art in the country were to be transported to the United States. Russia received tractors and grain in return. These lines can be read in the pact: \"This contract is secret. Art experts do not know about it. If they got to know about it, they would become hysterical. This is why it is important to keep it secret.\" TASS still managed to obtain a copy of the contract in New York. This art for wheat deal was made on the 29th of October 1991, after the breakdown of the Soviet Union! This was one of Gorbachev's last crimes against the Russian people before his resignation in December. His previous crimes are exposed in my book \"Bakom Gorbatjovs kulisser\" / \"Behind Gorbachev's Scenes\" (Stockholm, 1987). Soon after this, President Bush sent aid money for food in the form of a loan of 1.5 billion dollars to the Soviet Republics (except for the Baltic states, which had become independent) which was to be repaid {Expressen, 19th of November 1991.) At the same time he demanded that Gorbachev should use violence if necessary.

Now the Russians have to start working too.\" (Swedish TV-Aktuellt, 8th of July 1992.) Being a member of the influential Trilateral Commission, Bush of course knew what he was speaking about. The Phasing Out of Communism in Eastern Europe The KGB made some important contributions to the demolition of the Communist dictatorships in Moscow's satellite states. The KGB quite simply helped to overthrow the totalitarian regimes in East Germany (Erich Honecker later stated that there had been a plot to depose him), Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania. Sweden's television has even shown documentaries where various representatives of the former Soviet regime confirmed that a conspiracy of this kind was controlled from Moscow. That was why it was so easy to breach the Berlin wall. It was the Jew Kurt Goldstein who conceived the idea of building such a wall. The Jewish Party chief at the time, Walter Ulbricht, immediately approved the idea. This was revealed in Der Spiegel (No 16, 1991). That evil plan was realised on the 15th and 16th of August 1961. I can mention here that the relatives of those who were shot trying to cross the wall had to pay for the bullets. The democratic president of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, who is a freemason, also confirmed that the KGB had made preparations for a coup d'etat to depose the Communist leader Milos Jakes. Not everything went according to their plans, but the preparations of the KGB led directly to the so-called velvet revolution, which swept the Communists from power and brought Vaclav Havel to the fore. The KGB presidential candidate Zdenek Mlynar, who lived in Vienna and was Gorbachev's boyhood friend, refused to take part in the coup. (Dagens Nyheter, the article \"KGB planerade kupp mot Jakes\" / \"The KGB Planned a Coup Against Jakes\", 31st of May 1990.) It was stated in the BBC documentary \"Czech-mate Inside the Revo- lution\" that the KGB recruited people to provoke trouble among the students in order to depose Jakes on the 17th of November 1989. The chief of the secret police, Alois Lorenz, had received precise instructions 369"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"from Viktor Grushko, the vice-chief of the KGB, who had arrived from Moscow. Rumours were to be spread about a student who had supposedly been killed in a clash with the police. The agent Ludek Zivcak was given the task of pretending to get killed. An ambulance was immediately sent to take away the \"body\". This operation (wedge) was only partially successful. Jakes was deposed but the KGB agents could not silence the demands of the students afterwards. The KGB also helped to liquidate Communism in Poland. Several political observers revealed this. After this it was time to overthrow tin- hard-line Communist regime in Romania. In July 1994, the new Romanian Security Service, RIS, released a report about the hitherto concealed circumstances surrounding the deposition of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. RIS referred to secret agreements between Bush and Gorba- chev. About 1000 Soviet cars suddenly began arriving every da\\ beginning on the 9th of December 1989 (only 80 cars had previously passed the border every day). In each car were two or three \"tourists\" well-built men between 25 and 40 years old. Voice of America had earlier revealed how coded messages to the conspirators had been printed in the Romanian press. RIS asserted that agitators suddenly began turning up before the 21st of December 1989. They handed out drugs, which made people brave enough to challenge tin- tanks. The Soviet \"tourists\" (actually KGB officers) also took part in the clashes near the town of Craiova (Hommikuleht, 19th of July 1994, p. 7). Romania was the only nation in the Eastern block to have a bloody anti- Communist \"revolution\". It claimed thousands of lives. The dictator Nicolae Ceausescu perceived the conspiracy behind the events already at an early stage and tried to speak of the foreign involvement on television He was eventually arrested whereupon the victors decided to quickly execute him and his wife, which they did on the 25th of December 1989. The government power was taken over by the KGB agent Ion Iliescu, who immediately began to \"democratise\" Romania. To overthrow all the Eastern European regimes which refused to give in was also important to Moscow who needed to persuade their own old hard-line Communists to take a new direction. The United States of America was behind everything, as a Soviet representative hinted to the news agency Reuters in November 1989. {Dagens Nyheter, 30th of November 1989.) 370"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"It was also the United States of America that incited the Soviet Union to crush the rebellions in Eastern Europe in 1956 and 1968, since the interests of the lofty financial circles demanded it.

Before the 4th of November 1956, the State Department sent an explanatory telegram to the Communist leadership in Moscow, in which it was made clear that the American gover nment does not look with favour upon governments unfriendly to the Soviet Union on the border of the Soviet Union. (\"Congressional Records\", 31 st of August 1960, p. 17 407.) Several Hungarian historians admit that the U.S. government wanted to put down the Hungarian anti-Communist revolt. The American propa- ganda also claimed that Hungarians began murdering Jewish Communists and that it was therefore time to intervene. That was a false statement, however. Not even the Jewish executi oners within the Communist security service were killed. In fact, not even the hated Jewish chief of the security police, Gabor Peter (actually Benjamin Ausspitz), suffered that fate. Voice of America, meanwhile, encouraged the Hungarians to revolt. They were convinced that the United States would come to their aid. This was a mere play for the gallery, like Allen Dulles's speech about liberating Hungary from Communism. The United States calmly watched when Moscow violently and cruelly put down the revolt. 1945 people were killed in Budapest and a further 557 were shot in the province. 20 000 people were injured. {Dagens Nyheter, 1st of December 1990.) Moscow used 1500 tanks and 150 000 infantry troops. 200 000 people fled from Hungary. 40 000 were arrested. In contrast, both the United States and Moscow condemned British and French aggression during the Suez crisis in the autumn of the same year. Washington also gave the Kremlin the green light before they marched into Czechoslovakia. Zdenek Mlynar, who was a member of the Commu- nist Party's Politburo in Czechoslovakia in 1968, revealed after his escape to the West that Leonid Brezhnev had told the leaders in Prague at the end of August 1968 that the American President Lyndon Johnson had assured the Soviet Union that the United States of America would not interfere with the Soviet aggression in Czechoslovakia.

(Mikhail Heller and Alexander Nekrich, \"Utopia in Power\", London, 1986, p. 713.) Moscow had to shelve its plans to attack China. But it was quite all right to occupy Kabul in 1979. The United States also helped to put down the anti-Communist popular movement Solidarity in Poland. The Swedish journalist Ulf Nilson told Expressen the following on July 24, 1989: \"The man whom the American president valued most highly - and helped the most - was the ex-dictator Jaruzelski. Without Bush's help, the man who prohibited Solidarity would not have been elected president, but the United States sided with, paradoxically, the Communists.\" The CIA headquarters made sure that the operation with 1200 men in the Bay of Pigs at the beginning of April 1961 was foiled. The invisible hand in this case was not at all interested in deposing the freemason and Marrano Fidel Castro, whom it had itself helped into power. Guess who paid for his equipment, food bills and weapons in the Mexican training camps! The historian Jean Boyer stressed that Castro's money and weapons did not come from Moscow but from the United States. It was the freemason Eisenhower who helped Castro to power. The military aid to Cuba was later sent via the Soviet Union. So we need not be surprised at the fact that 5000 Cuban soldiers were used to protect the American and French oil companies in the Cabinda area of Angola when UNITA guerilla forces attacked foreign oil plants. {The Economist, Contra No. 5/1988.) The United States ceased supporting President Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua and began secretly helping the Marxist Sandinistas instead. (Svenska Dagbladet, 21 July, 1989.)

The Carter administration successfully closed all markets where Nicaragua could purchase arms and ammunition. The International Monetary Fund twice blocked badly needed standby credit for Nicaragua The White House successfully pressured all shipping companies to boycott Nicaragua so that the coffee crop could not be exported. The U.S. Department of Agriculture gave arbitrary instructions to beef inspectors to stop Nicaraguan beef exports to the United States. Public support was given to the Sandinista Communist movement.

But this is not correct. On July 3, 1979, President Jimmy Carter secretly signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet government in Kabul. Zbigniew Brezinski, National security Adviser in the Carter Administra- tion, wrote a note to the president in which he explained to him that this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention against Afghanistan. (Le Nouvel Observateur, interview with Zbigniew Brezinski, January 15- 21, 1998.) Carter wanted to provoke a war in Afghanistan. As if this was not enough, the CIA even helped the KGB to persecute and expose critics of the regime. The Soviet propaganda poet and freemason Yevgeni Yevtushenko (actually Gangsnus) in the periodical Ogonyok claimed this on the 6th of December 1988. Senator Robert Kennedy admitted during a conversation with him in 1966 that it was the CIA exposed the regime critics Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky, who were soon put on trial. The United States Also Helped the Chinese Communists Gain Power The stablishment of Communism in China was also supported by the Americans through Moscow or sometimes even directly. As early as in the 1920s, highly placed Jewish functionaries were visiting China to introduce Communism into certain areas. Am ong those \"advisers\" were Adolf Yoffe, Michael Borodin (real name: Jakob Grusenberg, founder of the Communist Party in Mexico in 1919), Bela Kun, Enrique Fischer (actually Heinz Neumann) and Vasili Bluecher (Galen-Chesin), who became responsible for gruesome atrocities against the Chinese people. Another Soviet Jew, Anatoli Gekker, who had been the veiled power behind the puppet Communist leaders Damdin Sukhkhe-Bator (1893-1923) and Khorlogin Choibalsan (1895-1952) in Mongolia in 1922, became political commissar for the Communist regions of China in 1924. Communism was introduced into Mongolia in 1921. Two Jews from Russia, V. Levichev and Yan Gamarnik, led the Chinese Red Army. An English Jew named Billmeier saw to it that the Chinese Reds were armed with Soviet weapons. 373"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"The Chinese Marxist Sun Yatsen (Sun Yixian) was an eminent freema- son. Even Chiang Kaishek (Jiang Jieshi) co-operated with the Communists in the beginning. He was a 33rd degree freemason (of the Scottish rite) who later broke away from the Communists and became the leader of bourgeois China. The United States demanded of the Japanese to stop fighting the Chinese Communists between 1937 and 1945. The American government betrayed Chiang Kaishek's anti-Communist front in the autumn of 1948. General George C. Marshall (1880-1959), then secretary of state, demanded that Chiang Kaishek allow the Communists into his govern- ment. Marshall had been President Truman's special envoy in China from 1945 to 1947. He asserted that the Communists were good people but Chiang Kaishek refused to comply. This refusal was all the Americans needed and Chiang Kaishek was left without help. Instead, the support for Mao Zedong increased (the aid to the Chinese Communists went via Moscow). On the 31st of January 1949, Communists in American tanks rolled into Beijing and on the 31st of October, the People's Republic of China was officially proclaimed. The civil war ended after having claimed 20 million lives. In the following year the United States claimed that Mao Zedong had distanced himself from dictatorship and sought to introduce democracy. Of course this was a lie, but they needed to show a good picture of the Chinese Communists. This was planned as early as the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945, according to Gary Allen. Understandably, USA wished to conceal its role in this process. This was confirmed by the representative of the State Department, Owen Lattimore: \"The problem was how to allow them [China] to fall without making it look as if the United States had pushed them.\" China is now an environmental disaster area. The most infamous area of industrial pollution in Russia and Eastern Europe seem like nature reserves by comparison. There are towns like Benxi (perhaps the world's dirtiest town) where 25-year-old Chinese die of cancer. (Dagens Nyhetcr, 9th of January 1994.) Mao Zedong had several Jewish advisers behind him. One of these was the British Jew Sidney Rittenberg who worked for Mao from 1946 to 1976. They were called \"voluntary advisers\". Thanks to such advice, Mao murdered 46 000 well-educated people in his campaign against intel- 374"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"lectuals in 1957. The number of such victims was later to rise. 43 million people died of starvation during a three year period in connection with the \"Great Leap Forward\". Another two million were murdered. The agri- cultural \"reforms\" had earlier killed 1.5 million landowners. During the cultural revolution, the Red Guards persecuted 100 million people, approximately half of which are believed to have died. It is known that at least 400 000 were murdered. No one knows the exact figures - the real figures may well be twice as high. 90 000 people were reported to have been massacred in Guangxi alone, according to incomplete statistics. (Dagens Nyheter, 17th of August 1992.) At the same time, an epidemic of cannibalism swept across Wuxuan. Its most extreme forms were \"cannibal banquets\": meat, liver, heart, kidneys, thighs, shins... boiled, fried, roasted. At the \"highest\" point of this epidemic, human meat was even prepared in the dining rooms of the revolutionary committee for the town of Wuxuan. (Dagens Nyheter, 17th of August 1992.) Zheng Yi, a Beijing Red Guard, related the following in an interview for a BBC documentary about Mao Zedong in 1993: \"In the beginning people murdered one another because of their political convictions. Then they began to eat people. Just killing them wasn't enough. Only by eating the flesh of their enemies could they show their class-consciousness. You would torture someone first, then cut up their stomach while they were still alive. Like at the slaughter of a pig, you would cut out the heart and liver, chop them up and eat them.\" Zheng Yi later became a dissident and succeeded in photographing some secret documents concerning Communist crimes in China. At least 137 people and probably hundreds more were eaten, according to secret documents about cannibalism among t he Red Guards in the Guangxi province at the end of the 1980s. (Dagens Nyheter, 8th January 1993.) Approximately 30 million people ar e assumed to have been killed during the first ten years up to 1959. The bloody terror began in Beijing on the 24th of March 1951 and spread to other major cities. In 1960 alone, morc people were killed in China than during the entire Sino-Japanese War. Professor Richard L. Walker at the University of South Carolina estimated the casualties of Chinese Communism up to 1971 to be 62.5 million at the least.

The United States of America is also responsible for those lives. The wealthy Jewish banker and Illuminatus, David Rockefeller, described Chairman Mao's terror regime as \"one of the most important and successful in human history\". He believed that it had succeeded in fostering high moral and common purpose in China. (The New York Times, 10th of August, 1973, Gary Allen, \"The Rockefeller File\".) After the massacre in Tienanmen Square in 1989, when Washington imposed official sanctions against Beijing, American companies continued to sell their products in China as if nothing had happened. The sanctions were not observed; they were just a play to the gallery. (Dagens Nyheter, 13th of December 1989.) Israel has also given China military and economic aid. The United States helped Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot's terrorists in Cambodia, Saddam Hussein (who, with this help, murdered at least 300 000 Arabs living in the oil-rich marshes between the Tigris and Euphrates in March 1991) and other political terrorists. But that is another story... 376"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"THE COMMUNIST TAKE-OVER IN ESTONIA The difference in living standards between the Soviet Union and its neighbouring states (above all Finland and the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which had been spared from Bolshevism) was all too obvious and in order to even out this difference, Moscow made prepa- rations to incorporate those states in the Soviet Empire. The international financial elite gave Stalin a free hand to act. The Baltic states were to have been the Soviet Union's base for its planned attack against Germany. (Carl O. Nordling, \"Defence or Imperialism? An Aspect of Stalin's Military and Foreign Policy\", Uppsala, 1984.) The extremist Jews of course played the key role in this action. A certain part of the Jewish population (the initiated) in the Baltic states had been prepared for the take-over for a long time. In Moscow, the preparations were finished as early as in 1937, when the Kremlin had the first maps of the Baltic states printed with the names \"Latvian SSR\" and \"Estonian SSR\". Phrase books in the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian languages were printed for the Soviet soldiers in 1940 (just before the occupation). The preparations also included plans for the deportation of Baltic citi- zens. Information about this was immediately spread to the international Zionist organisations. Vladimir Jabotinsky (born in Odessa 1880, died in 1940), a well-known Zionist activist who also founded the terror organi- sation Warriors of Zion, wrote a letter to one of the leading Zionist functionaries in the United States on the 2nd of November 1939. The letter dealt with the treatment of the Palestinians, whom the Zionists wanted to deport from Palestine. There was one very remarkable sentence in the letter concerning plans for a future deportation of the Palestinians: \"If it was possible to transfer the Baltic peoples, it is also possible to move the Palestinian Arabs.\" Jabotinsky's letter is preserved in the Israeli National Archives.

No ordinary politician had any knowledge whatever of the future Soviet occupation of the Baltic states at this point. Much less could anyone imagine anything as despicable as deporting the original population. A strictly secret decision to deport the anti-Soviet element from the Baltic states was signed by Ivan Serov (who was vice-people's commissary for security) in Moscow on the 11th of October 1939. The Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky not only knew about this planned crime, but also had a positive attitude towards it. Jabotinsky was not even a Communist -he was a right-wing extremist. Tens of thousands of people were deported to Siberia from the three Baltic states on the night before the 14th of June. 1941. Over 10 000 were deported from Estonia. The Communists wanted to deport over 700 000 Estonians to leave just 358 000 behind us administrators, but there was not enough time. A new deportation took place in Estonia on the 25th of March 1949, when over 20 000 people were sent away. People were also deported from the other Baltic states in the same year (43 231 from Latvia). 259 Christians were deported from Estonia in 1951. 750 000 Palestinians were driven or frightened out of their homeland on the 2nd of December 1947. The major Arab cities Jaffa and Haifa were completely emptied. Jewish forces forced the Palestinians out of hundreds of villages. In one village, Deir Yassin, 250 people out of 254 were murdered to frighten away the people in the neighbouring villages. 400 Palestinian villages were eventually either emptied or razed. The Israeli historian Benny Morris describes those events in his book \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem 1947-49\" (Cambridge University Press, 1988). The corresponding documents in the Israeli archives were classified as soon as Morris began publishing this information. The well-known Zionist author Jon Kimche described in his book \"The Seven Fallen Pillars\" how General Moshe Dayan shot like a madman at the inhabitants of the town of Lydda on the 11th of July 1948. The 30 000 surviving Arabs took flight. A similar burst of violence occurred in the nearby town of Ramallah on the following day. Kimche made a point of how all the possessions of the Arabs were plundered.

But there were still 150 000 Palestinians left in the country. Some of them were herded into \"reservations\". Israel, in order to gain entrance to the UN, promised to allow the Palestinians to return home, but as usual broke its promise. T wo Jewish cultural organisations, Licht (light) in Tallinn and Schalom Aleichem (Peace be to you) in Tartu, played an important role in the introduction of Bolshevism into Estonia. The same pattern of events was repeated in the other two Baltic states. Licht was founded in 1926. It was a subversive movement from the very beginning, according to a document (2197-2-3-227) in the Estonian National Archives. The organisation received its instructions primarily from Moscow. Licht co-operated with MOPR or the International Red Aid, a subversive organisation that camouflaged its activities behind aid contributions to various (Red) political prisoners. Licht kept in touch with the Estonian Communist Party's organisational office, which was in Sweden. Licht also distributed underground Communist literature, (Everything according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia, Tallinn, 1972. Vol. 4, p. 432.) Most of Licht's approximately 120 members were Zionist Socialists or Communists, who began systematically planning the coup against the Estonian Republic as early as 1936. Many activists (Moisei Pekker, Simon Perlman, Lazar Vseviov, Ksenia Aisenstadt, Leo Aisenstadt, Hans Grabbe, Sosia Schmotkin, Josef Goldman, Viktor Feigin and others) became members of Estonia's Communist Party (EKP) in 1936. I must point out here that this party had 387 members in 1934, of which only 133 remained in 1939. In the meantime, Stalin had had 254 Estonian Communists murdered. (Vladimir Karassev-Orgussaar, \"Molotov, Voroshilov and We\", Stockholm, 1988, p. 115.) Until now it has been concealed how many of the 133 remaining members were Jews, but information from 1945 has been found which puts the number of Jewish members in EKP at 69. (\"EKP in Numbers, 1920-1980\", Tallinn, 1983.) This almost certainly means that over half of the Communists in Estonia in 1940 (just before the Communist take-over) were Jews. In 1979, 1131 of the 4966 Jews in Estonia were members of the Communist Party. Compared with other groups, the Jews were very faithful to the Communist Party and were greatly over-represented in its activities, as was also the case in other 379"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"countries. New Jewish Chekists arrived in Estonia after the Second World War and committed terrible atrocities against the Estonian people. Licht's chairman in 1938 was called Moses Sachs. He worked closely with other Communists connected with Licht, like Idel Jakobson, Viktor Feigin and Gerschon Zimbalov. Marxist literature and the newspaper Kommunist were printed in the flat of the bank director Leo Aisenstadt. The printers were Ksenia Aisenstadt and Sosia Schmotkin. The Estonian Security Police, who did not then understand the Zionist connection, could hardly suspect a bank director of something like this. The leader of the Jewish community, Hirsch Aisenstadt (of the same family) was, according to a formerly secret document, also an agent of the Jewish agency in Estonia. He later joined one of the NKVD extermination battalions under the name Grigori Aisenstadt. He became a victim of the arbitrary punishments in 1949. After having given Estonia an ultimatum, the Soviet Union began the occupation of that republic on the 17th of June 1940. Estonia's political and military leadership, headed by President Konstantin Pats and Com- mander-in-Chief Johan Laidoner (both of whom belonged to a Masonic lodge in Sweden), refused to resist. Coups d'etat were organised to occur simultaneously in the three Baltic states on the 21st of June. Later, a myth was spread that the Baltic peoples had revolted in order to enslave themselves. \"A large number of Licht's members took part in the socialist revolution in 1940,\" according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia (Tallinn, 1972, Vol. 4, p. 432). The men who lowered the Estonian flag from the tower of Tall Hermann and raised the Red banner on the 17th of June were the 25-year- old Herman Gutkin, son of a rich Jewish merchant, Heinrich Gutkin, and the merchant Viktor Feigin. {Chicago Tribune, 24th of June 1940.) Both were members of Licht. The correspondent of the Chicago Tribune, Donald Day, had reported events in the Baltic states for 22 years. His impartial reports are very interesting. He related how the extremist Jews, led by Herman Gutkin, marched through Tallinn to the Soviet Embassy, where the Jews tore up the Estonian flag. That event is confirmed by at least one photograph. Donald Day pointed out in his memoirs that the editor had deleted the words \"the Jews\" from his text as it was printed in the newspaper. 380"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The Red take-over in Estonia's second largest town, Tartu, was orga- nised by the Jewish cultural organisation Schalom Aleichem together with the Communist Party. The Young Revolutionaries' Committee was foun- ded on the 22nd of June 1940 by the Jews Selda Pats (actually Zelda Paatz) and Moisei Sverdlov. The same Moisei Sverdlov led the Young Communists in Tartu. (Olaf Kuuli, \"The Revolution in Estonia 1940\", Tallinn, 1980, p. 112.) All anti-Estonian activity in Tartu was co-ordinated by Selda Pats and her brother Jaakov Pesah from Schalom Aleichem. The Jews had unlimited freedom in Estonia before the Soviet occupation. They had all kinds of organisations, their own schools and newspapers, within the framework of cultural autonomy. (Judisk Kronika, No. 10, 1986.) There was a professorial chair of Judaic studies at the University of Tartu. International Jewish circles have later denied all this. Max I. Dimont wrote in his book \"Jews, God and History\" (New York, 1962, pp. 374- 375) that anti-Semitism was prevalent in the Republic of Estonia and that the Jews were persecuted. He claimed that Estonia had no democracy and that anti-Semitism \"became the highest form of statesmanship\". According to him, the Estonians demanded a solution of the Jewish problem. He asserted that \"the Jews were legislated out of the professions\". The Estonians supposedly made that \"anti-Semitic legislation was increased\". Dimont, however, understood the real situation since he was studying in Finland at the time. Dagens Nyheter's (a liberal-socialist daily newspaper) Osmo Vatanen has helped to spread these myths. He claimed that the Jews could not find work in Estonia before 1940. {Postimees, 21st of February, 1992.) What was it really like? There were only 4434 Jews in Estonia in 1934. According to the history professor Hain Rebas, Estonia opened its borders to Austrian Jews. Yet a small number of Jews owned 11 per cent of the industry and controlled a still larger part. (E. Martinson, \"Profession - Treachery\", Tallinn, 1970, p. 22.) Over half of the shops in Tallinn's Old Town were owned by Jews. The wealthy merchant Heinrich Gutkin (born in 1879) represented Jewish interests in the Parliament. Together with Russian Jews, many Estonian Jews began directing the terror against the Estonian people in connection with the Soviet occu- pation. Hans Grabbe (actually Hasa Hoff), a board member of the Jewish cultural organisation Licht, became one of the NKVD chiefs. He became 381"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"the worst mass-murderer in the modern history of Estonia. He bore the chief responsibility for all the Communist atrocities and deportations. Hans Grabbe also gave orders for Estonian officers to be executed en masse. The Jew Idel Jakobson had no reason to hate Estonia. He was a Latvian citizen and arrived from Latvia to bring an end to the Republic of Estonia and introduce the dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e. the extremist Jews). He was caught in an underground printing shop in Tallinn and was tried in 1931. He was never tried after the fall of Communism. He worked from 1940 to 1941 as vice-chief of the investigatory department of the NKVD. He never released his own prisoners. He agitated with Communist propa- ganda speeches during the time of Estonia's independence. He introduced various methods of persuasion in the form of uncommonly cruel torture when working as a Chekist. He once seriously injured a young woman with the butt of his rifle during an interrogation. The woman later became a famous author. In April 1942, Idel Jakobson as chief investigator signed an order for 621 Estonians to be killed in the prison camp of Vostok-Uralsky in Sosva, though no trial had been held or sentence passed. The 93-year-old Jakob- son died in November 1996 in Tallinn. He was never arrested for the mass murder of Estonian citizens and other crimes during the Soviet occupation. Many other Jews had successful careers within the political police, for example the businessman Leo Epstein, the lawyer Josef Markovitsch, the lawyer Kroppman, the photographer Schuras, the businessmen Mirvitz, Gens, Bakszt, Kofkin, Himmelhoch... The Jew Feodotov was chief of the prison department. The Russian Jew Lobonovich became vice-people's commissary for internal affairs (in practice he led the Commissariat). The Licht member Viktor Feigin, who was also the leader of the dreaded terror organisation the People's Home Guard (RO), became director of the central jail in Tallinn. The NKVD commandant Arnold Brenner also gained an evil reputation. Feigin and Brenner had fought together on the side of the Communists in the Spanish Civil War. (Olaf Kuuli, \"The Revolution in Estonia 1940\", Tallinn, 1980, p, 111.) It was primarily the Jews who used torture. The dentist Budas gained an evil reputation in the town of Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa. He used to scald his victims' hands and feet in boiling water so that their swollen skin hung loose like gloves or socks. 382"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The Jewish NKVD doctors A. Tuch and B. Gluckmann, both of whom had connections with Licht, were especially cruel torturers, as was the hunch-backed female prosecutor Stella Schliefstein, who became notorious under the name \"The Spider\". She was an expert at torturing her victims by tearing up their arm and leg muscles. (The Estonian weekly newspaper Vaba Eesti Sona, New York, 25th June 1981.) Hirsch Aisenstadt, who was chairman of the board for Jewish cultural autonomy, admitted that the Jewish Chekists were the worst. (Sirp, 24th of December 1991, Andres Kiing's article \"About the Estonians and Jews in Estonia\".) Sosia Schmotkin and Leo Aisenstadt also became important Soviet functionaries, according to the Israeli professor Dov Levin. (\"Estonian Jews in the USSR, 1941-45\", Yad Vashem Studies, Vol. II, Jerusalem, 1976, p. 277.) Many Licht members joined the Soviet militia, according to documents I studied in the National Archives in Tallinn in April 1993. Among these were Manne Epstein, Hirsch Kitt, Gerschon Zimbalov and others. Foreign diplomats and military observers, whose reports related how Estonian Jews suddenly became political commissars for various com- pamies, mayors, aides to people's commissaries and agents-executioners in the NKVD, have also confirmed that a very large proportion of the extremist Jews actually betrayed the Estonian Republic, which had given them a safe existence through cultural autonomy, and began senselessly murdering and torturing well-inclined Estonians. Here I may quote a report from the 4th of April 1941, sent from Estonia to the C Bureau of the Swedish Secret Service at the General Staff. This report deals with the political changes, which had occurred in Estonia after the Soviet occupation: \"During the reorganisation of the judicial system, persons with a shady past, including many Jews, have been appointed judges... The number of Jews within the NKVD is especially remarkable. It was claimed that nearly all Estonian Jews are either indirectly or directly in the service of the NKVD. The Jews earlier had their own schools. These have now been dissolved and their pupils have been placed as Communist agents in Estonian schools. The Jews have also come to the fore in businesses, banks, etc.\" (Dagens Nyheter, 11th of January 1993, B 2.) 383"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"The Jews Dr Gens and Leo Aisenstadt were elected representatives of the Soviet-Estonian puppet government in Moscow, according to Dov Levin. The Bolsheviks in the Kremlin could not trust anyone else. The picture was exactly the same in Latvia and Lithuania. The same story was also repeated later (1948) in the rest of Eastern Europe. Jewish activists led the terror against the \"enemies of the people\" in their native countries. Here I can mention Foreign Minister Ana Pauker (daughter of Rabbi Zvi Rabinson), Josef Kisinevsky (actually Jakob Brotman), the Minister of the Interior Teohar Georgescu (Burach Tescovich), the chief of the Security Police, General Zamfir (actually Laurian Rechler) in Romania; Jakub Berman as the supreme chief of the Security Police in Poland; Rudolf Slanski (actually Salzmann) and Stefan Reis in Czecho- slovakia; Matyas Rakosi (actually Roth Rosenkrantz), Erno Gero (actually Singer), the freemasons Laszlo Rajk and Zoltan Vas (Weinberger), who were all Soviet citizens, in Hungary. Their primary victims were the representatives and pillars of the sensible societies they sought to destroy. Why is it that rancorous extremist Jews have always predominated at the head of violent revolutions, coups d'etat, political assassinations and other terrorist activities throughout history? Is this really a coincidence or was it planned that way? My readers must seek the answer to this question themselves. The shock at seeing the Jews taking the leading role in the introduction of Communism was especially great in Estonia where the 4434 Estonian Jews had been treated very well. More than 10 million books were destroyed after the Soviet take-over of power in Estonia in 1940, a figure which is never mentioned in the book-burning propaganda. After this, the Communists began spreading their own \"truths\". The terror in Latvia was led by the following Jews: the chairman of the NKVD tribunal was Simon Shustin (who came from Moscow and later emigrated to Israel), Isaac Bucinskis became Latvia's chief of militia, Alfons Noviks was commissary of internal affairs. The Jewish doctor Moses Zitron became infamous as a torturer in the Daugavpils jail. In 1991, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet in Latvia, Anatolis Gorbunovs, condemned the atrocities committed by the Communist Jews in the country. Swedish Television actually reported this.

Noviks was accused of genocide, since he had organised the awful reign of terror and many of the executions in Latvia. Novik's usual method, according to surviving witnesses, was to torture and beat prisoners to squeeze \"confessions\" out of them. He was now described as \"the people's executioner\" in the Latvian newspapers. The case was investigated by a special government commission for the investigation of political crimes committed in Latvia during the years of the occupation. The NKVD began executing Latvian patriots immediately after the Soviet take-over. Lists of 978 such people were discovered after the Bolshcviks' retreat in July of 1941. A document which the Chekists had not had time to destroy was found. It was an order by Simon Shustin to shoot 74 people, including six women. Quartered bodies of the victims of the Red terror were found buried in the courtyard of the Central Prison in Riga. Simon Shustin had signed this execution order on June 26, 1941 and added the following with red ink: \"Considering the public danger they constitute, they should all be shot.\" It was no coincidence that he was called \"Latvia's executioner\". Why were these victims so dangerous? J. Krischmanis had spoken in favour of a free Latvia and Estonia. Viktor Somovits had sung Latvian folk songs. Others had criticised the Soviet regime... Those martyrs had endurcd torture and indescribable, terrible sufferings before their lives were ended with a pistol shot in the neck. Many bodies had been mutilated beyond recognition. Is it strange then, considering all those horrible crimes against huma- nity, that an anti-Semitic attitude surfaced in Latvia, where 95 000 Jews lived? This would have happened in Sweden or any other country as well. There were Jewish, ostensibly non-Communist members of the Latvian Parliament. There was Rabbi Nurok, who was deported to the Soviet Union on the 14th of June 1941. He survived, strangely enough, and later became a member of the Israeli Knesset. (Expressen, 24th of March 1969.) The Jewish terror (Bernson, Gorlitsky and others) against the Lithua- nian people was exceptionally cruel. 34 000 women and children 385"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"disappeared in 1940 alone. I lack the words to describe all those atrocities. The doctor and ex-Communist Joseph Schmollers tried to describe the role of the extremist Jews in the Red terror in his book, \"Vorkuta, the Story of a Slave City in the Soviet Arctic\" (London, pp. 108-110). There were 250 000 Jews in Lithuania. 70 000 lived in Vilnius. They were ultra- orthodox and therefore eagerly welc omed Communism, which gave them an official pretext to show what they really thought of the Lithuanians. It came as no surprise when the Swedish Jew Mose Apelblat called the new Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1944 \"the Red Army's liberation\" in Dagens Nyheter on the 27th of January 1987. The Lithuanians, if official propaganda is to be believed, killed nearly all the Jews. If this was the case, why were more than 20 per cent of the names in the Kaunas telephone directory still Jewish after the war? The Jews' most famous rabbi, Maimonides (Moshe Ben Maimon) was the author of the book \"More Nebochim\", a new edition of which was printed in Warsaw in 1872. In this book Maimonides wrote, among other things: \"It is undoubtedly the will of Yahweh that all gentiles should be murdered, including small children with their parents and parents' parents without discrimination. This decree is often found in the Torah.\" (Op. cit.. Vol. 1, chapter 54, p. 81b). Confucius said: \"The man of noble mind seeks to achieve the good in others and not their evil. The little-minded man is the reverse of this.\" (Confucius, The Analects, 12:16. Translated by W. E. Soothill. London. 1910.) The Jewish Illuminists have always been little-minded men. Our misfortune is a result of this. Licht began actively persecuting non-Communist \"reactionary\" Jews The property of non-Socialist organisations was confiscated. Licht tried to ruin the Jewish businessman Salomon Klutschik. The 56-year-old merchant Salomon Epstein also had confrontations with fanatical Marxist Jews. The \"progressive\" Jews did not allow any company to employ him. The Germans later unlawfully sent him to a concentration camp. It is worth mentioning that at least 14 Estonians dared to defend him. (Eugenia Gurin-Loov, \"The Great Holocaust\", Tallinn, 1994, p. 115.) The Germans executed him. The Communist Jews had arrested his son and sent him to Russia. On the 7th of September 1940, Licht began to publish the weekly newspaper Na Leben (The New Life) for other Estonian Jews. The editor- 386"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"in-chief was Simon Perlman (born in 1902). Licht, headed by Moisei Scheer and Leo Epstein, decided to close all Jewish organisations, which disturbed the Marxist activities. Their funds and resources were taken over by Licht, according to documents in the Estonian National Archives. Licht abolished itself in the autumn of 1940. It had served its purpose - thc Republic of Estonia had been eliminated. The \"revolutionary\" Jews later preferred to work behind the scenes. Hitler's forces attacked the Soviet Empire on June 22, 1941. A speedy withdrawal of the Red Army from large areas (including the newly acquired Baltic states) was necessary. On the 26th of June 1941, Major General Rakutin, the commander of the NKVD border troops in the Baltic countries, ordered the forming of special extermination battalions, of 320 men each, in compliance with Beria's decree of the 24th of June 1941. The terrible suffering which the Estonian people and also \"reactionary\" Jews and other ethnic groups were subjected to was, of course, organised by Marxist Jews. Mikhail Pasternak held the supreme command over the extermination battalions. He even had a street in Tallinn named after him. Josef Goldman's NKVD extermination battalion performed some especially brutal actions in July 1941. Goldman was a member of Licht. When I compared Licht's list of members with the names of those in the extermination battalions, I was surprised to see how many Licht members dealt in destruction and murder. They even had plans to poison wells. Here follows a list of the most active criminals: Zemach Delski, Jakob Vigderhaus, Moisei Zimbalov, Refoel Goldmann, Isaak Halupovitsch, Schimon (Semjon) Hoff, Simon Strassm an, Abram Vseviov, Isaak Bulkin, Meier Minsker, Isaak Minsker, Gers chon Zimbalov, Moisei Schimsche- levitsch, Leo Epstein, Boruch Schor, Grinstein and others. At least 120 Estonian Jews were among the 8980 men in the 27 extermination battalions, according to Dov Levin. That information is misleading. Estonia's bourgeois Prime Minister Mart Laar revealed in his book \"The Forest Brothers\" (Tallinn, 1993, p. 24) that there was an exlusively Jewish extermination battalion in Estonia. 320 equals at least 120 - that is Zionist mathematics. The Jews were, in any case, massively over-represented in those merciless units. Some historians judge that the Jews made up 6 per cent of thosc battalions, i.e. at least 540 men. (Eesti Ekspress, 7th June 1991.) 387"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Their percentage of the population was only 0.4 per cent. The most important question is who the leaders of the terror were. Only 40 per cent of the members of the extermination battalions were Estonians. Many of these came to Estonia as Soviet citizens from Russia after the Communist coup in June 1940. Common Estonian criminals also joined those battalions and of course also those Estonians who were Soviet agents. The rest were Russians and other nationals, including many Jews. The ethnic composition of those battalions was a state secret, as was that of the EKP (Estonian Communist Party). The extermination battalions often worked together with the Red Army. The exterminators also wore \"uniforms\": they had work overalls with a red armband. Only the leaders wore NKVD or militia uniforms. Most of them also had a red, five-pointed star on their caps. The low-ranking Communists in the Spanish civil war often fought in work overalls too. This indicated their ideological background. Some of the members of Schalom Aleichem in Tartu also volunteered to join the extermination battalions. Among these were Selda Pats and her brother Jaakov Pesah and also Josef Mjasnikov, who founded the Zionist movement Netzach in Estonia, according to Dov Levin. Movsa Michelson, chairman of the Jewish cultural organisation in Tartu, admitted the following in an interview in the newspaper Edasi (26th of February 1989): \"At the beginning of the war many [Jews] joined the extermination battalions.\" The militiaman Gerschon Zimbalov was one of those who joined. The extermination battalions were known for their almost indescribable cruelty and brutality, especially towards women and children. The victims were thrown alive into fires, parts of their bodies were cut off, they were nailed to walls... All this also happened in Soviet Russia. The Red terror ruled Estonia for two months until the 28th of August 1941, when those stormtroops were defeated. They had orders to liquidate everything in their path, to imprison the opponents of the Communist system and to eliminate them on the spot if necessary. The infamous Boris Friedman and Jershik Schigol terrorised the area near the town of Voru, Jakob Jolanski in Parnu, Shustov and others in Kuressaare. What sort of things were these violent criminals doing? Here are a few typical, well-documented examples, which have not acquired the ano- 388"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"nymity of the great terror waves. Josef Goldman, who commanded one of these extermination battalions, gave orders to the effect that all women and girls found on roads, farms or in fields should first be raped, then have their breasts cut off and finally be burned alive. Men were also treated in a similar manner: first they lost their genitals, then their eyes, after which their stomachs were cut open and they were finally killed as slowly as possible. Being a member of Licht, Comrade Josef Goldman really did represent an exceedingly strange, uncivilised and peculiar \"culture\". Twenty men were arrested by the exterminators at the railway station in Viluvere. They were taken to Tallinn where they were interrogated. The Jewish commander of the seventh extermination battalion, L. Rubinov, gave the order to murder these men in the Liiva forest. Before they were killed, they were tied up with barbed wire, which cut through the palms of their hands, and their ears were cut off. Selma Ratsep in Kudina, the farmer Rudolf Pall near Tartu, Anna Kivi- mae and her daughters Ulanda and Armilda near Tartu, Lembit Ital in Kuusalu and many others were also murdered by the exterminators, following torture. Anna Kivimae's head had been crushed, her daughters had been raped, their eyes squeezed out. In western Estonia, August Savir (40 vears old) had his stomach cut up, after which his head was crushed. Three exterminators led by the Jew Leo Epstein stormed the 83-year-old Karolina Muhlbaum's house in Jarva-Jaani on the 24th of July 1941. Her house was plundered and she was forced to accompany them. Her body was later found by a road leading into Kaagvere. The killers had smashed her face. The gardener Albert Palu was burned alive in Helme on the 5th of July 1941. Albert Simm and his wife in Puhajoe met the same fate. The 14- year-old Tiit Kartes was arrested in Aseri later on the same day. He was cruelly tortured, after which his genitals were cut off and he was murdered. His body was found in the forest. The exterminators flayed some of their victims alive, cut off their fin- gers, tore off their arms. A shepherd boy was torn apart between two cars near Haapsalu. Anette Lenk in Kuressaare was tortured with boiling water. Jewish youths, acting as agents for Moscow, shot passing pedestrians in Tartu from windows. A few of these murderers were caught. They were carying bottles of petrol with which to start fires. Others were carrying poison to poison wells. 389"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"The Soviet-Estonian periodical Vikerkaar published an article by the historian Mart Laar (who became Estonia's right-wing prime minister in the autumn of 1992) in November 1988, under the title \"The Time of the Horrors\". The article described the crimes of the extermination battalions. This of course upset the Soviet authorities and they wanted to take Mart Laar to court for spreading false information, since these inhuman acts seemed improbable. Everything was later confirmed by other sources. Here are just a few examples of the horrible crimes Mart Laar described. The Communists destroyed three Estonian villages and all their inhabitants in an especially cruel manner. The children were nailed up in trees, pregnant women were beaten to death. In the village of Ehavere, babies were affixed to the breasts of their mothers with bayonets. The women's tongues and breasts were cut off. I later found information about how pigs were sometimes fed with the corpses of Forest Brothers (Estonian guerrilla soldiers). The Jews Hans Grabbe (Hasa Hoff) and Mikhail Pasternak bore the ultimate responsibility for those atrocious crimes. The Estonian nation lost 25 per cent of its population (around 250 000) during the first ten years of Soviet occupation. The best educated and most active citizens were the ones to suffer the most. Imagine placing every Estonian - men, women, the aged and children - in a long line and shooting every fourth person. This was what they did to Estonia! Other crimes seem pathetic in comparison. The active role of the extremist Jews was a complete surprise. To the Estonians it felt like a slap in the face. An Estonian Jew, Joosep Frank, who emigrated to Israel, admitted in the Estonian exile newspaper Meie Elu (Toronto) on the 10th of July 1986 that \"the Estonians were never hostile towards the Jews\". The leader of the Estonian Jews, Samuil Lazikin, told the Swedish journalist Jan Lindstrom in 1989: \"During the time of the Republic of Estonia, there was no official anti-Semitism whatsoever in Estonia.\" Lindstrom wondered \"Did the Jews live well in Estonia then?\" Lazikin answered: \"Naturally, of course!\" (Expressen, the 4th of September 1989.) So it was not a question of revenge. Despite this, all the Jewish employees of certain companies in Tallinn joined the extermination batta- lions. I can mention the Jewish-owned factory Rauaniit, where every Jew, with the manager Zemach Delski at the head, joined the exterminators. They were not loyal to the Republic of Estonia but to a foreign power. 390"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Th Jewess Irina Stelmach admitted in the newspaper Hommikuleht (Tallinn) on the 17th of December 1993 that there were many Jews in the extermination battalions. Soviet-Estonia became the Jews' promised land, according to Augustina Gerber, the editor-in-chief of the Jewish news- papcr Hasahar in Tallinn. Indeed, the Jews became high-ranking chiefs within the Soviet power apparatus in occupied Estonia. They controlled radio (Ado Slutsk), TV, the record industry, scientific development and, of course, the propaganda. The Jewish political scientists Herbert Vainu, Gabriel Hazak and Simon Joffe were the most important radio commen- tators. The falsification of history was controlled by the Jewish \"dictator of history\" Herbert-Armin Lebbin, who continued publishing Communist lies about how the Estonians voluntarily joined the Soviet Union and chose the path of progressive socialism in the periodical Aja Pulss (No. 11 and No. 12), as late as June 1988. In 1980 he published the propaganda book \"In the Service of Anti-Communism\", the audacity of which exceeded all other books of its kind. The ideology at the universities was under the control of the following Jews: Rem Blum (professor of sociology at the University of Tartu), and Eugenia Gurin-Loov (lecturer in philosophy at the Institute of Education in Tallinn). When a few exiled Estonians were, for the first time to some extent, allowed to tell the Swedish press about the important role the Jews played in the crimes of the extermination battalions, the Jewish lawyer Hans W. Levy from Gothenburg tried to explain that \"the words 'extermination battalion' are reserved for the Nazi Einsatzkommando groups\". (Svenska Dagbladet, 6th of February 1992.) In all seriousness, he meant that the Jews had never been involved in extermination. Hans Levy is wrong. The Germans never committed any atrocities as widespread and terrible as the ones I have described, when they came to the Baltic states. I need only mention here that Moses Hess saw Communism as the best means by which to spread annihilation. If we compare testimonies about how the extermination battalions ravaged Estonia with reports from the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel, we can see that the crimes committed by the Zionists of today are of the same nature as those committed during the spread of Communism into the Baltic states in 1940-41. Here are just a few typical headlines from the Swedish press concerning crimes against the Palestinians: \"Palestinians Tortured to Death\" (Aftonbladet, 9th of February 1988), \"Jewish Terror 391"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Against Palestinians\" (Svenska Dagbladet, 9th of June 1987), \"Soldiers Beat 15-Year-Old to Death\" {Aftonbladet, 9th of February 1988), \"17- Year-Old Shot to Death in Gaza\" {Aftonbladet, 10th of January 1988), \"Ten Palestinians Burnt to Death\" {Aftonbladet, 29th of February 1988), \"The Israelis Shot Two Children to Death\" {Aftonbladet, 6th of June 1990), \"Israeli Massacre in Palestinian Village - Six Villagers Shot Down\" {Expressen, 14th of April 1989), \"The Soldiers Broke the Prisoner's Arm\" {Expressen, 27th of February 1988), \"The Police Shot Straight at the Children\" {Expressen, 2nd of April 1989), \"Playing Five- Year-Old Shot to Death\" {Expressen, 19th of October 1988), \"Chemical Warfare Against Palestinians\" {Dagens Nyheter, 23rd of March 1988). That Israeli soldiers break the arms of Palestinian prisoners is no act of individual arbitrariness. The model of this act can be found in the Old Testament, Psalms 10:15-16 and 37:17. The first passage reads: \"Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.\" In February 1988, the 15-year-old schoolboy Iyad Mohammed was dragged out of his home and beaten to death with rifle butts. Witnesses stated that the Israeli soldiers had completely mashed his head. {Svenska Dagbladet, 9th of February 1988.) In the spring of 1988, four Palestinians were forced to lie on the ground while a bulldozer covered them in earth in Kafir near Nablus on the West Bank. Villagers later managed to dig them out alive. {Svenska Dagbladet, 16th of May 1988.) Representatives of Save the Children have gone so far as to claim that Israeli soldiers shoot at children on purpose. At least 64 children were killed during the first 11 months after the beginning of the intifada {Dagens Nyheter, 8th of December 1988.) In defence, the Zionists say that they have to shoot at people who throw stones at them. Foreigners (including Muslims) have thrown stones at tin- police in France and England without getting shot in return. A 23-year-old in Malmo (Sweden) threw a stone at the police in the spring of 1993. The court fined him. {Dagens Nyheter, 30th of October 1993.) This will have to be enough. The facts clearly show, however, that the Zionist Jews are involved in unusually violent and horrible forms of extermination in their \"various projects\". Palestinian houses have been blown up, many villages have been razed. These methods are hardly 392"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"compatible with the policies of a democratic country. To what purpose did Israel sign the Geneva conventions? The Israeli weekly newspaper Ha'olam Hazzeh published the 5th of January 1974 Lieutenant Colonel Avidan's brochure \"The Purity of Weapons\". He is also the rabbi of the Central Region Military Command. He instructs the readers in their duty to kill civilians. Soldiers do not only have the right, but even the duty to ki ll civilians. That is Mitzvah - a good deed for Yahweh. The Soviet regime in Estonia was weakened considerably in 1988. The struggle for freedom began in earnest. Ideologists and functionaries became desperate - they did not want to lose their privileges as members of the nomenclature (nomenklatura - the Marxist power-elite). At the same time, they wanted to make it impossible for any anti-Semitic attitudes to surface in the country. That was why the KGB planned a punishment operation in Estonia between the 20th and the 26th of November 1988. The planned operation was called The Disobedient. It was to have been led by the KGB Colonel Samuil Mikbailov (actually Samuil Michelson), a Jew born in Parnu, Estonia. He was the chief of the Baltic section of the KGB. (Nadalaleht, 19th of October 1991.) The Soviet regime in Estonia ended anyway. The country became independent in August 1991. That was a hard fact for the Marxist Jews to swallow. The Jew Yevgeni Kogan was at the head of the so-called Internationalists, who tried to sabotage the independent Estonian develop- ment in any way possible. No measures were taken against him. The newly founded Jewish cultural organisation in Tallinn began a slander campaign in Sweden to damage the image of Estonia abroad. That was how they rewarded the Estonians who kindly permitted the founding of this new Jewish club of disinformation. On the 18th of November 1991, a fax about a supposed meeting of Estonian SS men and Jew-killers was sent to the Swedish Committee for Soviet Jews. The meeting was, in actual fact, for Estonian war veterans, former Red Army as well as Wehrmacht soldiers. They had gathered for a reconciliation and to discuss the matter of their pensions and other problems they had in common. But the stupid Swedish minister of foreign aid. Alf Svensson, who had made a fool of himself on a number of previous occasions, swallowed the bait and warned about the danger of fascism in Estonia. The Marxist Jews in Estonia, headed by Gennadi 393"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Gramberg, were overjoyed by this contribution to their attempts to regain some of their former privileges. A Latvian Jew, Samuil Zivs, formerly vice-chairman of bar association of the Soviet Union have also spread slander and similar disinformation. On the 17th of January 1992, the Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa apologised for his soldiers having used tens of thousands of Korean women as sex-slaves during the Second World War. (Dagens Nyheter, 18th of January 1992.) The Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama also apologised for other war crimes on the 15th of August 1995.1 naively hoped for a similar gesture from the Jews of Estonia. I was wrong. I received quite the opposite. On the 8th of April 1992, the weekly newspaper Eesti Aeg (Tallinn) published a lengthy article where I described the contributions of the two Jewish cultural organisations (Licht and Schalom Aleichem) to the Communist terror in 1940-41. In conclusion, I asked the present Jewish cultural union to distance themselves from those crimes and to apologise to the Estonian people. The fanatical extremist Jews became enraged and counter-attacked. They have definitely refused to apologise. They have demanded that the Estonian people should collectively assume the guilt and responsibility for the crimes, which the German occupational forces committed against Jewish Chekists and terrorists. The Estonian government did actually apologise to the Jews. Estonia even joined in the shameful decision to abolish the UN resolution, which stamped Zionism as racism. The Jews, in contrast, tried to deny the crimes they committed during the first Soviet occupation. They claimed that the Estonian people bear a collective responsibility for \"masses\" of Jews having been murdered in the country. The Jews, on the other hand, do not bear collective responsibility for the crimes which \"a few Jews perhaps\" committed, according to the Marxist Jewess Eugenia Gurin-Loov. (Eesti Maa, 3rd of February 1993.) Encyclopaedia Judaica claimed in 1971 that 1000 Jews were killed in Estonia. Then Expressen in Sweden published Soviet lies to the effect that 12 000 Jews (an impossible figure) were murdered in Tartu alone, in cluding women and children. (Expressen, 21st of April 1987, p. 9.) But only 200 Jews were murdered in Tartu according to the Israeli information. Most of them were guilty of violent crimes. The Jewess Eugenia Gurin-Loov puts the figure of Jews killed in Tartu at 159. The 394"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"New York Times published a report of the proceedings with the eye- witness Oskar Art, who had driven the Volvo bus carrying the prisoners to the place of execution. He claims that only 50 Jews were shot in Tartu \"but no children\". Which of these figures seem most likely to be true? The Germans failed to organise anti-Jewish riots among the Estonians - they did not want to take part, in spite of the terrible crimes Jews had committed against them. No Jew pogroms have ever taken place in Estonia. Even the Jews admit this. There are still Zionists who claim that the Estonians began killing Jews before the German forces arrived. One of these was Salomon Schulman who published his views in Expressen, then the largest daily newspaper in Scandinavia, on the 10th of January 1992. There were fewer than 1000 Jews left in Estonia in the autumn of 1941, according to the Jewish professor Dov Levin (921 according to the German security police chief Martin Sandberger's report). 3000 had been evacuated to Russia. The Estonian Jews were able to present only 474 names of Jews who were killed. Only 474 Jews had been killed before Estonia was declared \"clear of Jews\" in January 1942, according to document 180-L, which was used at the Nuremberg trial (Sirp, 24th of December 1991). Eugenia Gurin-Loov presented the names of 929 executed Jews in her book \"The Great Holocaust\" (Tallinn, 1994). The same propagandist asserted in the periodical Horisont in 1991 that 2000 Estonian Jews had been executed. This figure was actually higher than the total number of Jews in Estonia at the time. One might think that not a single Jew in Estonia was spared. Facts tell a different story. Valev Uibopuu, a famous Estonian linguist and exiled author in Sweden, confirms that some Estonian Jews, who were quite innocent of thc crimes committed by the Soviet regime, survived the German occupation. He wrote: \"In the early spring of 1943, I sat in a dentist's chair in Nomme (a suburb of Tallinn). My female dentist was Jewish. It was the last time I saw her, since I left Estonia that summer to escape the ever more troublesome grip of the German occupation. I later heard that my dentist had moved to southern Estonia, where she had continued with her work. She made it through the war alive, i.e., no one informed on her. Her daughter, who was a young student, also survived and is now a doctor in Tartu.\" (Estniska Dagbladet, Stockholm, l0th of January 1992.) This report had been written for Sydsvenska Dagbladet, which refused to publish it. 395"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"The Soviet propaganda constantly accused the Estonians (collectively) of participating in mass-murders of Jews. Even the exiled Estonian author Andres Kiing was classed as a war criminal, despite the fact that he was not even born at the time of the war. (Dagen, 5th of March 1987.) Jewish activists continue to commit crimes against Estonia by claiming that the Jews had nothing to do with the Soviet regime. More recently they have admitted that there were a few \"solitary\" sympathisers among the Jews. This is a true example of Jewish audacity - chutzpah. The Encyclo- paedia Judaica gives an example of this: the son killed his parents and turned to the synagogue fund to request orphan benefits... There were 4613 Jews in Estonia in 1989 (there were 5436 in 1959). Only 8.4 per cent of them spoke Estonian, while 34.5 per cent understood the language. (Aja Pulss, No. 1, 1991.) This is how the Jews show their respect for the Estonian culture! The truth must eventually come ou t. Those concealing a crime become accessories. Nevertheless, Jewish activists have done everything in their power to keep the truth about the crimes of the Jewish Marxists against the Estonian people in 1940-41 from coming out. They refuse to reveal how many Estonian Jews worked for the Soviet regime. They still wish to revenge themselves on those who dare to tell the truth. During the time of the Red terror regime, it was not even permitted to say that life was better in bourgeois Estonia than in the Communist Soviet Union. Oskar Sommer said it anyway. He was sentenced to ten years in a forced labour camp. The Zionists wish to be spared revealing articles about Jewish crimes in Estonia. Rabbi Leon Mark Perlman even claimed on the 17th of August 1992 in Goteborgs-Posten that \"democracy in the Baltic states is threatened\" as a result of articles, which reveal the role of the Jews in the Communist terror. That was sheer chutzpah! At the same time, one can read in newspapers how the Jewish financial world has begun infiltrating the Estonian economy. (Rahva Haal, 16th of July 1993.) The Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar suddenly became ex- ceedingly co-operative in this respect. The Jews appear to have complete control of the economic and ideological situation in the Baltic states once more.

The funds to found the lodge camc from Sweden. There are already representatives of the international Jewish Masonic organisation B'nai B'rith in Estonia. The Jewish lawyer Leon Glickman in Estonia became a member of this organisation in 1989, according to an interview published in Eesti Ekspress. (20th of August 1993.) The ruling circles in Tallinn would like to see Estonia in the EU. They are not interested in the good of the country. The Communist occupation authorities in Estonia caused enormous damage to the Estonian society. They poisoned both the spiritual and physical environment, destroyed the people' s morals with audacious lies and hypocrisy, damaged the public health with cheap alcohol and inferior food and limited the people's chances of spiritual development. The Soviet regime damaged Estonia economically too. The occupation cost Etonia 10 billion dollars per year since 1940, according to information, which was made public on Swedish TV on the 5th of July 1991. The other Communist countries were similarly affected, and China, Vietnam, Cuba and a few other remaining Communist states are still suffering under this system. Mentally retarded children in closed institutions received worse treat- ment in Estonia than animals did in the West. In 1965, before Western tourists were allowed in Estonia, the Soviet authorities gave orders to round up all the war invalids begging on streets and squares in a single dav. The fittest were sent to special concentration camps on the island of Valam, where they were put to work. The others were destroyed. This is enough. It is impossible to describe all of the Communists' crimes here. The shadowy financial forces and Jewish Communist leaders refuse to assume guilt or responsibility. Who will bear this guilt then, for all the peoples that were degraded, oppressed and made helpless in the shackles of Communism? The helplessness is due to the fact that the Communist system allows only a spec ially chosen group of suitable slaves to survive, a group who lacks the insight or judgement to lead the others.

The situation is reminiscent of a well-known Hungarian joke: at the end of the Second World War, there was a group of Jews in an air raid shelter in Budapest. They were discussing the situation. When the bombing had ended, they decided to send a Jewish boy outside to find out what the order of society was like, so that they could adapt themselves to suit it from the very beginning. The boy asked: \"How will I know?\" An older Jew answered: \"It is very simple. If young Jews are in power, it is Communism, but if old Jews are in power, then it is capitalism.\" Here it is necessary to quote the Danish Jew Samuel Beskow, who said the following in a public speech on 8 December 1935: \"We Jews have taken our place at the centre of society: stock-markets, banks, ministries, newspapers, publishing houses, courts, insurance companies, hospitals and schools. We are everywhere, since it is not just a question of taking possession of the gold in our struggle against the Gentiles.\" {Berlingske Tidende, 9th of December, 1935.) The leading Swedish socialist and Member of Parliament Arthur Engberg stated in the newspaper Arbetet on 12 March 1921: \"There is a justification for the claim that the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia actually means the dictatorship of the Jew over the Russian.\" Engberg was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Arbetet in Malmo. Can the fact that the extremist Jews have not apologised mean that they intend to continue their activities in the future? 398"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"SUMMING UP: SOME CONCLUSIONS Soviet Communism fell on the 24th of August 1991 after the KGB's elite Alfa troops refused to obey the orders of the hard-line Communists. Subscquently, the Soviet Union was officially abolished on the 25th of December 1991 at 7:33 in the evening. There was no alternative. Moreover, new plans had become more urgent - plans to found a new Soviet Union using trickery, with another ideology (mondialism) and undcr a new name, the European Union, where the market economy would rule. The truth about the evils of Communism has now begun to come out to an ever greater extent despite many Communists, primarily Jewish ones, telling us: \"Do not dig up the tragedies and crimes of the past!\", \"We must forget history!\" (Expressen, 6th July 1992.) Here one might ask the question: what sort of future may we expect if we do not dare to face the truth? The great philosopher and doctor Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bom- bastus von Hohenheim, 1493-1541) has written: \"It is just as necessary to understand evil things as good, for who may know what is good without knowing what is evil?\" In Sweden, no really important secrets have been revealed. The government has even made it impossi ble to watch Russian TV since it bcnan showing the break-up of socialism. This was an unpleasant experience for the Swedish socialists, who preferred to ignore the truth. Aftonbladet wrote in its editorial on the 5th of November 1989: \"A break-up of the Soviet Union is nothing to be desired.\" Aftonbladet belicved the Soviet Empire to be a factor for peace. The Socialist foreign minister, Sten Andersson, even stated that Estonia was not occupied by the Soviet Union, a statement which upset the Baits. Guess who praised Andcrsson's statement. Yes, the Marxist Jews in the Baltic countries. I read about this in several newspapers there. The Communist paradise died.

The Soviet Union perished like the scorpion, which takes its own life when surrounded by flames. The scorpi on is a symbol of destruction. But it remains to be seen whether the scorpion of the Illuminati will reincarnate into a new body. \"He who controls our history also holds our future in his hands,\" to quote the author George Orwell. For this reason it is still very difficult to obtain true facts about Communism. It is also the reason why there has never been a \"Nuremberg 2\" to punish the crimes of the Communists - during such a trial it would quickly become apparent who really organised the mass murders of Russians and members of other races in the name of the Soviet Communist Party. Such an investigation would cause the worst imaginable backlash against the Zionist racists. That is why the names of the executioners must not be revealed. The advocates of justice in Sweden have been remarkably quiet about the awful crimes of the Soviet regime. It would be quite justifiable to call the Soviet regime a spiritual Cherno- byl - a terrible social catastrophe. But Communism, Socialism, National Socialism, Fascism and Capitalism are in fact all just symptoms of one disease, which is best named Illuminism. For the name of the Beast is the Illuminati. The West was totally against the independence of the Baltic states at the beginning of the process of liberation. The Lithuanian leader Vytautas Landsbergis was repeatedly mocked in Sweden. He said forthrightly: \"The West is helping the Soviet Union to destroy our freedom!\" (Expressen, 9th of May 1990.) Nevertheless, the Communist Party sank like the Titanic. No one without insight into the real situation believed it possible. I predicted it already in the middle of the 1980s. The era of the Soviet Union was an age of mediocrity and dilettantism. The gifted were given a very hard time. In order to prevent it from happening again, those who know must not remain silent. If they do, they will share the responsibility for those crimes against humanity and the lack of history caused by Illuminist propaganda. Edmund Burke said: \"All that is necessary for evil to succeed is for men of good will to do nothing.\" It is also against the law to conceal a crime. There have always been naive and ignorant people who have tried to justify evil. One of them was the Swedish journalist Peter Kadhammar who thanked Lenin and said farewell to him in an article after the collapse of the Soviet regime. (Expressen, 25th of August 1991.)

But after people had got rid of Communism which, like a devil, had ruled their lives, they found that this devil had been grafted into their own minds and bodies. The Estonian Commander-in-Chief, Aleksander Ein- scln, an American colonel who returned to his homeland, confirmed: \"The Estonians are a sick nation. There are no ethics or morals or honesty here.\" {Expressen, 5th of January 1994, p. 24.) The Communists left behind them a Russia where half of the children in some regions are born deformed (Dagens Nyheter, 13th of May 1992). There were already 20 million alcoholics in the Soviet Union in 1987. Up to 50 million people live in a comp letely destroyed environment. The number of cancer victims increases by two per cent every year. Four million people live by the dried up Aral Sea, earlier the world's fourth largest lake. Enormous amounts of salt from the dead bottom of the sea are carried away by gales to destroy fertile ground. What is happening by the Aral Sea can also be called an ecological genocide of the Karakalpakians. The newborn are subjected to chemical attacks, since various en-viron- mental poisons are spread together with the salt. The drinking water is strongly polluted. The children are brain-damaged. But the most frightening thing is the genetic changes. Meanwhile, every fourth Russian woman who has an abortion becomes sterile. 10 million women had become sterile in this way by 1992. A Russian doctor confirmed on Swedish TV in April 1994: \"We are a dying nation!\" Since 1992, more Russians die than those born. Four out of live Russian children are ill, according to Swedish TV-Aktuellt (TV News) on the 1st of August 1994. No one ever demanded that Moscow should cease its destruction of the environment. Everything happened under the slogan: \"We need no alms from nature. We take all we please from nature.\" The result was an unparalleled catastrophe. A third of the Ukraine's once so fertile earth is now unusable. After the Second World War, the Red Army dumped 300 000 poison gas shells in the Baltic Sea. These have now become a serious threat to this already heavily polluted sea. Many places are also polluted by radioactive substances and have become dangerous disaster areas. The radioactive contamination in Russia is a very serious matter. We must all pay a high price for the lunacy of the Communists. 401"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Lately Russia has begun pointing out the guilty parties. Many Jews became frightened of the possible reaction when the truth about the role of the extremist Jews in the Communist oppression came out. They emigrated to Israel, despite their privileges in Russia (this was actually admitted by Dagens Nyheter, which had earlier spread the myth about government-sanctioned anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union). They have become a burden to the Israeli public medical service, since a third of all the Jews suffering from cancer in the country are from the former Soviet Union. The Russian Jews make up just under 9 per cent of the population, according to the Israeli journalist Nurit Wurgaft. (Dagens Nyheter, 15th of August 1993.) The mass immigration began in 1988, when the crimes and privileged status of the extremist Jews during the time of the Communists began to be questioned and discussed more often. Stalin's grandson Yevgeni Dzhugashvili showed amazed Western jour- nalists a list of the responsible functionaries at the various People's Com- missariats, which practised the great terror against the population between 1936 and 1939. Every name was marked with a symbol. A star meant that the person in question was a Jew, a dash that he was Russian. \"It is virtually all stars!\" said Yevgeni Dzhugashvili. (Expressen, 18th of August 1991.) It is due to those terrible events that at least a sixth of the Russian population is definitely anti-Semitic, according to several opinion polls. They are convinced that there is an international Jewish conspiracy {Dagens Nyheter, 4th of January 1991, A, 11). The leading Russian authors Valentin Rasputin, Vasili Belov, Valentin Pikul, Yuri Bondarev and Viktor Afanasyev have all perceived the hidden power of the extremist Jews in Russia. Vasili Belov has written a novel filled with facts which show that it was Communist Jews who bore the responsibility for the incredible brutality of the forced collectivisation. Meanwhile, one or two Jewish functionaries, including Rubanovich, have said also on Swedish TV that they will never apologise for their crimes. The Jewish activists prefer to leave the scene when other people are in need of help. At the beginning of the civil war in Abkhasia, many Jewish doctors emigrated to Israel, leaving thousands of wounded to die. (Dagen, 18th of December 1992.) A fine example of doctor's ethics. 402"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Many criminal Jews have also taken the chance to emigrate to the West (also Sweden). A large number of these immigrants became notorious, merciless gangsters in the United States, according to the New York Times (4th of July l989,p. 38). The Russian Jew Boris Kagarlitsky even claimed in Dagens Nyheter (6th of July 1990) that socialism was not dead. But it definitely did not work, since 90 per cent of the state-owned factories, the kolkhozes and state farms had gone bankrupt. They had been kept alive only with benefits. The Jewish Social Revolutionary Alexander Herzen's prophecy from 1850 has now come true: \"Socialism will develop until it reaches its own extremism and absurdity. Then a shout of denial will break forth from the heart of a revolting minority. Once again, a battle of life and death will be fought when Socialism will either take the place which Conservatism now holds or be defeated by future but to us as yet unknown revolutionary forces.\" (Alexander Herzen, \"From the Other Shore\", Tallinn, 1970, p. 106.) \"Socialism has been a tragedy for our people. It was a bad thing that it had to happen to us. It would have been better if it had happened in a smaller country,\" proclaimed the Russian President Boris Yeltsin in September 1991 (Svenska Dagbladet, 7th of September 1991). In Sweden the false Soviet \"version\" of this tragedy is swallowed without a second thought. Did not Napoleon say: \"What is history but a myth that everyone has accepted?\" Most Swedes have accepted the many myths about Communism. It was so nice to believe in the fairy tales, which claimed, among other things, t hat the citizens of the Communist countries at least had a social security. It was certainly a fine kind of security with security agents and spies everywhere! It was also claimed that the Soviet citizens had the right to work. The slaves could not work normally under oppression for worthless money, which could only be used in shops where there was nothing worth buying. It could also be proved that the workers in the Communist countries were in poorer health than those in the West. On the 13th of December 1991, the Jewish cultural editor of Expressen, Leif Zern, published an article by Claudio Magris who wept and lamented over the fall of the Soviet empire: \"I believe we must regard the tragic fall of Communism with respect and even love. We only need to think of the 403"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"thousands of men and women who died for this belief.\" This writer intensely disliked reading revealing articles about Lenin. He did not weep over the more than 300 million victims of Communism. He was on the side of the executioners. The Jewish political scientist Amos Perlmutter warned in the Washington Post in September 1989 that the break-up of the Soviet Union might become uncomfortable for the United States. He believed that the new states would not be able to do anyth ing sensible with their liberty. He also maintained that the Baltic states lacked a democratic tradition. The international financial elite has become very worried about the consequences of the fall of the Soviet Union, now that free discussion is no longer regarded as a serious crime in Russia. That is why the mass media have taken every opportunity to speak of the \"fascist terror\" of the Stalin regime, of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, Pol Pot and the others. They do not want those crimes to be labelled Communist terror. Instead, they want the ghosts of Lenin, Stalin and other mass murderers to escape via the back door of the vast slaughterhouse they built and ran so successfully. Not one of the Western leaders wanted to halt Communism, despite the fact that its ideology, which was based on hatred and agitation, was directed against all intelligent people. It was all just one big babble circus. A sensation hit Soviet Russia on the 26th of August 1990 when \"Catechism for the Jews of the Soviet Union\" was published. This text contained secret instructions, which had been worked out by Zionists in Tel Aviv in 1958. But this was not the first sign of a reverse. There were Jews who, in the press, informed the Russian public of the existence of such texts in order to publicly distance themselves from them. On the 26th of October 1989, the newspaper Chelyabinsk)? Rabochy published a reader's letter from the Jew S. Peisner who said he was loyal to Russia and distanced himself from \"Catechism for the Jews of the Soviet Union\". He quoted the most cynical passages of the instruction text and wrote: \"I am a Jew, but not a Zionist. Why is there no one who can stop their criminal activities? How would they feel if someone were to publish 'Catechism for the Jews of the Soviet Union?1 Then everyone will understand that all their activities on the small and large scale were strategically planned and tactically determined.\" 404"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The Zionists went completely silent. Russian nationalists had mean- while managed to obtain copies of the \"instructions\". Here are some typical excerpts from these directives: \"It is necessary to help our young Jews into leading positions. The Russians are not capable of profound thought, analysis... they are like pigs... Everything, which belongs to them today, is actually ours - they are using all this only temporarily. God has instructed us to take everything from them... The goys [gentiles] are stupid and prim itive, they can't even lie... Slander their most eminent people who are capable of making speeches... our motto is respectable audacity... Accuse all who try to work against us of anti-Semitism and label them anti-Semites. Constantly spread statements about the eternal suffering of the Jewish people, who have been persecuted in the past and are now discriminated against. The tactic of the 'poor Jew' has vindicated its practitioners for thousands of years. God wanted us Jews to rule the world and this is what we do. Keep the mass-media and information tools in our hands. People without history are like children without parents. They must begin aII over again and then it will be easy to give them our world view and way of thinking. In this way we can liquidate entire races. They must lose their history and their traditions, following which we shall be able to shape them In our way... Through marriage with Jewesses, there is a possibility to bring Russians under our influence and into our sphere of interest. Buy up, destroy and prevent the publishing of books, which reveal our tactics and strategy. The goys must never know the real reasons behind Jew-pogroms. They must be forced to choose chaos or us. When they try to do without us, we must cause complete chaos. Make sure that the disorder remains until the suffering and tortured gentiles desperately want our regime back. The gentiles must work under our leadership and be useful to us. Those who are not useful to us must be expelled. He who is not with us is against us 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,' that is what Moses taught us. Money is our God!\" The Jewish doctor Jacob Nussbaum, who is a highly placed functionary in an international organisation based in Vienna, also said virtually the 405"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"same thing to the author Lars Gustafsson, himself a Jew: \"There is nothing, nothing standing between us [i.e. Jews in leading positions. - J. Lina.] and chaos any longer.\" (Svenska Dagbladet, 10th of April 1983, p. 14.) He also claimed: \"Europe... in international organisations is of course to a very great extent quite simply an expression of Jewish universalism... Without Jewish universalism and without the Jewish faith in the stability of values, there will be no place for Europe.\" He could probably not have expressed himself in a more insolent man- ner. Communism-Socialism was also an expression of Jewish universalise which resulted in over 300 million victims, ruined societies and destroyed environments. The Zionist-Frankists, through the blindness of the peoples, have been able to fool us with all those isms, which have led to impotent and idiotic social engineering. In this book, which can be regarded as a study of evil, I have tried to inform the reader about the real background of this criminal and impotent universalism and to dispel the historical falsehood which presents Lenin as an immortal example of lofty moral strength (Gorbachev's book \"Perestroika\"), the collectivisation of agriculture as something positive, and other similar myths. I have at least tried to retrieve a part of our history, which the shadowy forces have stolen from us. I am sure that the material I have managed to collect for this book is but the tip of the iceberg. I am just as sure that we shall eventually hear of more and more horrible secrets. What is awaiting us now? The international financial elite now wants to replace the former Soviet Union with the European Union, according to the Austrian political scientist Dr Karl Steinhauser's book \"EG - die Super-UdSSR von morgen\" (Vienna, 1992). Karl Steinhauser shows that the freemasons are in the process of creating a new federal superstate, the capital of which will be Brussels and which will have its citizens supervised by electronic means. A control system with an 18-figure personal ID number has already been built up. We shall never be able to pass certain control points without being identified. The Masonic and Illuminist leader Giuseppe Mazzini's dream of the United States of Europe seems about to come true. On the 30th of September 1992, the Hungarian journalist Andras Bencsik, editor-in-chief of Pesti Hirlap, published in his newspaper the article \"The Art of Crushing the Hard Core\" where he allegorically 406"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"described the basic problems which every post-Communist society has to grapple     with.     Andras Bencsik declared: \"The internal political crisis in the Republic of Hungary is a result of the trap whose nature is to pull the society which falls into it further into the trap, the harder that society tries to break free of it. If the nation would patiently wait and accept its fate, it is still not certain that this would see it to safety. This trap is reminiscent of a spider's web, where the captured fly, desperately buzzing, tries to tear itself loose. The fly seems to tear asunder the finest strands of the web, but the spider, which sits concealed at the edge of the web, feels the strength of the filaments and patiently waits, keeps out of sight, becomes nearly invisible. But this is not because it is shy. ...This drama is tragic for the fly. It is about the fly's life. For the spider it is natural - this is how it feeds. It is really about a struggle for survival. The nature of the struggle is that both sides believe themselves to be in the right. That is why the possible final results are also similar. Either the flies' or the spiders' order of society will be victorious. If the flies win, there will not be many opportunities left for the spiders. If the spiders win, the flies' society will degenerate into a mere food-farm. They will procreate just to feed the spiders. In the society of flies, there is democracy whereas in that of the spiders there is dictatorship. Today we know both forms. Only a few among us have discovered that, while our old and dear spider's web dried up and withered, the new spiders stretched a new, dazzling web beneath us, so that our liberation actually means that we fall into a newer, stronger web instead of being able to fly about freely. The spiders, who had organised their parasitic nation into a hard core, had a more advantageous situation when they began reorganising the structure of society which had broken apart. Their advantage lay in the fact that they knew their own culture very well and had no doubts that their position had become considerably worse. The world was not created for the spiders, but the heavenly will had a place also for them, as for the mosquitoes. We may express it in this way; that it happened so that the peaceful creatures would not start feeling too secure...\" This is the best analogy I have seen regarding the current situation in Europe. 407"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"The Hungarian author and Member of Parliament Istvan Csurka wrote an article where he said outright that there was a conspiracy, which was consciously damaging Hungary. The Jews, the Liberals and the IMF (the International Monetary Fund) led the conspiracy. Of course, a big scandal broke out. It is not permitted to describe one's beliefs if they are unpleasant and disturbing. The plans for the future Europe were ready well in advance. Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi (1894-1972), who was the first president of the Pan-European Union founded in 1923, wrote the following in his book \"Praktischer Idealismus\" / \"Practical Idealism\" (1925): \"The future man will be a mongrel. As for a Pan Europe, I wish to see there a Eurasian-Negroid mixture with great variation in personality types... The Jews shall take the leading positions, since good providence has given Europe a spiritually superior race of nobility called the Jews.\" (Pages 22 and 50.) I found the freemasons' plans for the future Europe in Wiener Freimaurer Zeitung (Vienna, September 1925 and October 1926). The freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi asserted in his autobiography that the Pan-European Union was, at the beginning, sponsored by a circle of Jewish bankers led by Rothschild and Warburg. In 1925, the Grand Lodge in Vienna sent an appeal to different Masonic federations to support Kalergi's Pan-European movement. Even Swedish Jews have used the racist myth about the Jews being the chosen people and admitted that there is a particular conspiracy against mankind. Herman Greid very nastily wrote the following: \"But God has not chosen them because they are a holy race, but they are holy because it pleased God to choose this race to complete a certain task in his plan for mankind.\" {Judisk Kronika, No. 4, 1971, p. 4, column 2.) In this book I have tried to show what this so-called plan has meant for us all. No thanks to all crimes, terror and oppression in camouflaged forms! To stop this process, it is necessary to recreate our history and avoid new mistakes by putting no faith in the new, treacherous actions of the financial elite. These plans have so far included manipulation with inferior foodstuffs (propaganda for junk-food and aspartam), irradiated and gene-manipulated food, economic manipulation, as practised by the Hungarian Jew George Soros, suppression of environment-friendly inventions and energy sources... 408"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"409 "},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"The financial elite has already succeeded in destroying our cultural life. Modern music is twisted and stupefying with its strongly mechanised rhythm. Art evinces many symptoms of decadence, and most novels are spiritually empty. At the same time, they are trying to accustom us to entertainment that openly and insolently propagates violence as a way to solve problems. But has the reader ever seen the so-called holocaust exploited as violence entertainment? The financial elite manipulates science, hides facts about certain phenomena under the categories 'inexplicable', 'debatable' and 'non- existent'. The schools turn out 'useful idiots'... Instead of Communism, which really is a terrible ghost on the loose in Europe causing spiritual rabies wherever it goes, there is now mondialism (le monde = the world) which involves an even greater danger. It is a new ideology, which is to uphold and justify the build-up of the European Union. Igor Shafarevich's revealing book \"La setta mondialista contro la Russia\" / \"The Mondialist Sect against Russia\" was published in Parma in 1991. The main goal of the mondialists, according to this book, is to eliminate the sense of nationality; destroy the minds of young people with hard-rock music, violent films, pornography and drugs; imitate the American way of life in its worst form; blot out historical memory; mix the races by means of mass immigration... The subject of mondialism, which is pure Illuminism in a new form, has hitherto been avoided in Sweden. The goal of the mondialists is a world government. The freemason Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of this goal in Fulton, United States on the 6th of May 1992 when he admitted that there was a chance to create a \"world government\" after \"the cold war\". Even Lenin suggested the forming of the United States of the World (the World Union of Socialist Republics) in the newspaper Social- demokrat (No. 40) in 1915. Lenin asserted that there would be no national states in the future. The freemasons, with new versions of their old tricks, are at the head of all the major nations.

In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s the KGB effectively infiltrated several important Masonic lodges and used these for its own purposes. Together with the CIA, the KGB was actually among the sponsors of the Masonic lodge P2 in Italy. (Stephen Knight, \"The Brotherhood\", London, 1985, pp. 271-289, and according to an interview with the former CIA agent Richard Brenneke on Italian TV in the summer of 1990.) There are some very special plans for Russia now. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) - the primary tool of the international financial elite - has already taken care of the raw materials of the former Soviet Union. At the same time, the nation lacks designs and resources to build an advanced production industry. Capitalism was reintroduced in Russia not just because of Commu- nism's all too disturbing backward slide, but also in order to plunder the real production more fully and to transfer the surplus value created by the wage-earners into speculation and economic manipulation, as in the West today. The third alternative, that of an economy without interest and inflation, is out of the question, since such an economy would make the financial elite powerless! There are still some sensible people in Russia who have been able to perceive the game which is being played. Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote the following on the 6th of October 1990: \"The Russians have been plun- dered for 73 years, and have thereby fallen into humiliating poverty. Someone thinks that this is not enough and has decided to carry on plundering until nothing remains.\" The leading Jewish politicians (Gaidar, Kozyrev, Primakov, Yasin and others) made sure that 60 per cent of the Russian assets (oil, factories, airlines, banks) ended up with criminal Jewish \"businessmen\" in Russia at the beginning of the 1990s. They plundered the country. The infamous criminal Boris Berezovsky became the new owner of the airline Aeroflot.

The Russian oppositional press has begun warning about mondialism. This is not the case in Sweden or Germany. A remainder of less-informed Communist and Nationalist forces (useless idiots) in Russia naively believed that they could still act freely on the political scene and control development. That was why those Communists once again tried to gain control over Russia by attempting to depose Boris Yeltsin in September 1993. But their time was definitively up. The international financial elite made sure they were removed, just like the freemasons did with the nationalist maverick Lavr Kornilov in August-September 1917. It was obvious that the freemason Boris Yeltsin had great difficulty in putting down the rebellion in the beginning, since the army wanted to remain neutral in the conflict. On the 4th of October 1993, the Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev ordered the elite brigades of the Tamansk division to Moscow. He promised the officers new homes if they obeyed. Grachev wanted at least 10 groups, but only four joined him. They began shooting at the parliament building. The special anti-terrorist force refused to murder Yeltsin's enemies. Only a part of the Omon police forces (riot police) and the presidential guard joined in the battle. Yeltsin did not dare to trust these completely, as the Russian journalist Vladimir Alexandrov revealed in Russia and abroad, and so Yeltsin agreed to have 35 members of the international Zionist terrorist group Betar sent to Moscow. (The Spotlight, 22nd of November 1993.) When this group first tried to force their way into the parliament building, Cossacks forced them back. The interesting thing was that there were (according to amazed foreign journalists) so many Jews among the defenders of the parliament. That clique had not yet understood that the epoch of Communist pretexts was a closed chapter. Afghanistan veterans and criminals from the organised gangs working in Moscow were later sent to attack the parliament building. Betar turned up shortly thereafter with their shock tactics. One could listen to internal radio communication, which revealed how Betar advanced inside the building. Betar was founded in 1923 by Zeev Jabotinsky in Riga, Latvia.

The revolt was put down on the 4th of October 1993, since the Commu- nists were no longer welcome on the Russian political arena and also lacked support from the United States. The evil Communists had earlier been able to advance primarily due to their support from the financial elite and the compliance of good people. In the meantime, the Jewish activist Vladimir Zhirinovsky (actually Wolf Edelstein) had come onto the scene, of course not without help. He has been forced to conceal his Jewish origin in order to demagogically exploit anti-Semitic attitudes in Russia. In 1988 he was a member of the board of the Zionist Soviet group Shalom. His former comrade on the board, Yuli Kosherovsky in Israel, revealed this. (Dagens Nyheter, 18th of December 1993.) The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv wrote on the 17th of December 1993 that Zhirinovsky had relatives in Israel. Zhirinovsky was also, as a KGB agent, expelled from Turkey for espionage in the 1960s. Zhirinovsky himself told the newspaper Ma 'ariv that he never wanted to conceal the fact that he was Jewish. He pointed out: \"The Jews have a special role in Russia. 90 per cent of Lenin's party were Jews. Also 90 per cent of my party are Jews.\" Zhirinovsky's \"liberal democratic\" party was founded on the 31st of March 1990 by the KGB, by order of the Communist Party so that Boris Yeltsin would not receive too many votes. This fascist movement became the second largest party after the Communist party. Zhirinovsky is no right-winger. Many true Russian patriots say: \"Zhirinovsky is a KGB puppet. You must be joking if you say that he is right-wing!\" Zhirinovsky is a common political lunat ic who, among other things, has threatened to commit genocide: \"If it cost the lives of 90 000 Russians to eliminate a million Estonians, it would be a good deed.\" (The Baltic Independent, No. 135, 1992, p. 6.) It is obvious that Zhirinovsky's role is to control and direct the anti- Semitic attitudes of the Russians and to frighten various small nations to join the European Union. Here I must mention a Swedish proverb: \"Fools rush in where wise men fear to enter.\" Zhirinovsky is a useful scarecrow for certain forces. Because he is useful where he is, he has not been allowed much leeway. The really dangerous enemies of Zionism are si mply murdered - this is what 413"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"happened to the foremost expert on Zionism in Moscow, Yevgeni Yevseyev, in 1990. He worked as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophical Studies in the Academy of Sciences. Virtually anything is possible for the international financial elite, who controls 80 per cent of the global capital. The loan-lenders' power grows and the politicians' room to manoeuvre shrinks as the state deficits of the industrial countries grow. The national debts of the industrial countries have risen to the astronomical amount of 15 000 billion dollars over the last 20 years. The super-capitalists have of course become richer in the process. The plundering of the industrial countries continues at full speed. The result may be bankruptcy, hyper-inflation or complete obedience to the financial elite. In the best imaginable case, our great-grandchildren might be free of tax-slavery if they spend all their money paying off the interest and suffer deprivation whilst their parasites grow still richer. Russia is being plundered especially intensively. There are one or two voices being raised in protest (including Moscow's former mayor Gavril Popov) against the shock therapy of the Jewish advisers (Sergei Shakhrai, Sergei Stankevich), which has meant that Russia has been ruined anew and subordinated to international monopolies. The policies of the Baltic countries are decided by a secret group comprised of high-ranking diplomats from different countries. (Svenska Dagbladet, 28th of March 1994.) The guidelines still come from certain financial forces. The Financial Times wrote on the 1st of November 1996: \"The bankers - several of whom are leading members of Russia's Jewish community - feared they could become the target of an extreme nationalist backlash.\" Those bankers (Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodo- rovsky, Piotr Aven, Mikhail Fri edman and Alexander Smolensky) control about 50 per cent of the economy. They constitute the power behind Boris Yeltsin. The dark forces, which transformed Russia into a cauldron of evil, must watch as Russia becomes a source of enlightenment for the whole world. The social myths and false ideas of the Illuminati had catastrophic consequences, which I have shown in this book. Unfortunately, their activities continue in new, camouflaged forms. That is why we must not forget the mocking paradox the French writer Jules Verne has formulated: \"The more things seem to change, the more the situation remains the same.\" And the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 414"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"ascertained: \"The only thing we learn from history is that no one learns from history.\" The European Union was also founded under the sign of Scorpio - on the 1st of November 1993. The reader might wonder whether there really are any parallels between the Soviet Union and the European Union. Unfortunately, there are plenty of them. The EU Parliament is simply an advisory organ with no legislative powers. The parliament of the former Soviet Union (the Supreme Soviet) had no legislative power either. The EU Council (the government) is dependent upon propositions from the EU Commission in order to make its decisions. The Ministerial Council of the Soviet Union, too, was unable to make any decisions without directives from the Politburo. The EU Commission has the real power and can make decisions with 8 out of 17 members present. The deliberations are not public and the minutes are classified. The supreme organ of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, the Politburo (normally with 15 members), also held the real power. Their deliberations were likewise kept secret. When the EU was founded on the 1st November 1993, the chairman of the EU Commission, Jacques Delors (a Socialist and freemason), was given more power than the governments of the member states. All the candidates for the post of Commissioner have to be approved by the chairman. The general secretary of the Politburo also held totalitarian power, which, in part, is reminiscent of the powers invested in the chairman of the EU Commission when it was founded in 1993. There are many high-ranking EU officials, who are also freemasons, and who organise crime within the framework of Masonic Lodges of the Girand Orient and the Italian Mafia Cosa Nostra, according to information from Brian Freemantle's book \"The Octopus: Europe in the Grip of Organised Crime\" (London, 1995). High-ranking party functionaries in the Soviet Union also organised crime together with criminal organisations. High-ranking freemasons within the EC, and later the EU used their knowledge of astrology to strengthen their position. It was in this manner that the high-ranking freemason Francois Mitterand, who had become president of France, found the best date to hold a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. He also had horoscopes made for several members of the socialist government of the ti me.

They utilise their knowledge of astrology to increase and extend their secret power-base. Officially, astrology is just superstition without any basis in reality. So - do not believe everything these false power-mongers tell you! Think for yourself and the secrets of the world will begin to open before you! Even the secret power of the Illuminati can be broken. The Illuminati cannot stand the light of truth and seek to avoid it, just as the scorpion hides from the sun. The dark forces will inevitably fail and light will once more reach the souls of men. A Masonic symbol: \"Ring of European Freemasons Organisation for the Reform of Masonry\". The observant reader will note a certain similarity to the current European Union flag. 416"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY Agraniants, Oleg, \"What is to be Done? or Deleninisation of our Society\", London, 1989.
