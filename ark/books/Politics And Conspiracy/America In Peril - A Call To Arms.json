ANSWER TO ALL OF THE ABOVE QUESTIONS: THE UNITED STATES! Where did all of the above acts of treachery and treason take place? These are the exac t locations in at least one confirmed instance, but not necessarily the only ones. Here they are in numerical order: 1. Thousands of Russian military ve hicles have been offloaded from ships in New York City; New Orleans, Louisiana; Gulfport, Mississippi; and numerous other American ports. Those in Gulfport are hauled a few miles north to a U.S. Customs compound located just outside the quiet little community of Saucier. Here the vehicles are safely stored. They are eventually painted white for the UN who, it turns out, actually owns them in the first place! 2. Fort Dix in central New Jersey was closed by President George Bush (CFR). This army base was then transferred to the UN as a site for training hostile foreign military personnel. Numerous other clos ings have since followed.

Russian Spesnaz, highly traine d special forces killers, are being stationed on U.S. military bases. These troops are the elite of Russian military intelligence. They are the world's most highly trained saboteurs and assassins. Spesnaz units are trained to run concentration camps, transport prisoners and handle civilian uprisings. 5. United States Marines and sold iers as well as foreign UN military men are being trained as teams to fight in urban warfare situations. These are troops who go in and \"neutralize\" or take over buildings, neighborhoods, and even small towns in what the military calls \"Operations Other Than War.\" Many American m ilitary bases have constructed entire mock communities that could pass for most small villages in America.

Helicopters have been observed by aggressive ly following automobiles and keeping them in their gun sights while conducting \"urban drills.\" It's not uncommon to look up and see heavily armed gunships and attack helicopters flying overhead. 8. Republican President George Bush (CFR/Trilateral Commission) and his top heavy CFR administration diligently worked toward a treasonous New World Order dictatorship.

And then he suddenly found what he had so diligently been seeking: \"I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her democratic congress and her matchless constitution, and it was not there. Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and pow er. America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\" \"If My people, which are ca lled by My name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways: then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and wi ll heal their land.\" II Chronicles 7:14 118"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"How C AN Y OU H ELP ?

Are any parks in your area of the country off limits to tourists or local visitors? SO WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP? Every American should be on the alert for any and all of the above situations! Every pa triot should watch for any kind of unusual military activity in or around their town or city. You might periodically drive by your local National Guard armory and check for foreign United Na tions vehicles. Also look for Russian helicopters or UN choppers from other countries. Take photographs if at all possible. All you need is one of those inexpensive throwaway cameras. Everyone s hould keep one in their vehicle glove compartment at all times. Train yourself to listen! Make an effort to be more observant! Help to spread the word! Share your photographs and information with others. Do your part! Help expose the traitors responsible for these unconstitutional, anti-American activities! Send your story and pictures to: M.W. Jefferson P.O. Box 12619 Knoxville, Tennessee 37912-2619 Do you realize that the UN hate-America crowd is boldly setting up an oppressive secret police network in America? That traitorous U.S. leaders are aware of this situation? That these traitors deliberately say not hing or do nothing to stop this treason? Do you realize that U.S. military authority has been quietly transferred to the United Nations by these same traitors? That many of our national parks and national forests have been turned over to the UN? That many of our national parks and 120"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"How C AN Y OU H ELP ? national forests are being used for training Russian and other foreign troops?

WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? You have the facts! Now ask questions! Demand honest answers! The startling information in America In Peril and also in America Under Siege is enlightening, provocative, and infuriating. It's long past time we cut through the bureaucratic smokescreen. The answers to the questions raised are long overdue! We can and will get them — if you will do your part as outlined below: 1. Distribute copies of America In Peril and America Under Siege to your friends, co-workers, school teachers, ministers, acquaintances and neighbors. Request that they read one or both of these books. Give copies to local radio and television stations and newspapers. Ask them to review these important books. 2. Calling, writing or faxing your Senators and Representative in Washington r eally won't do much good. Look at their past record. But should you decide to try this, insist on a straightforward response to your questions. Insist also that a Congressional Committee be established to investigate the many important questions raised in America In Peril and America Under Siege. Don't put much hope in this endeavor. 121"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"A MERICA I N P ERIL Why? Because many in congress have already proven by their words and deeds to be traitors. Most others really don't care what you may happen to think. 3. Call, write or make personal contact with state legislators and local political leaders for answers to your questions. Don't really expect these people to know much of anything about the questions you pose. But, your questions and a gift of America in Peril and America Under Siege might be the catalyst that opens an otherwise closed mind. 4. Call in on radio and television talk shows. Ask questions developed from America In Peril or America Under Siege. Or make a statement requiring an answer. 5. Write letters to the editor of your local daily and weekly newspapers. Do this once-a-week using material taken from America In Peril and America Under Siege. Help to get other people th inking! Start asking those questions and writing those lett ers. Force your Senators and Representative in Washington to fulfill his or her responsibility to you and to America. Force these people to give straightforward answers for a change. Let you voice be heard before it's too late! WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO? It's extremely important that each individual find out about any militia activity in his or her city, county or state. If there is a militia already formed in your area, then make contact and join! If you know of none, then write: M.O.M., P.O. Box 1486, Noxon, Montana 59853. Or call th ese people at 406-847-2246.
