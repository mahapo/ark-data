Yet, most of those who have so hysterically condemned this book have never even read it . . . Critics viciously attack the author, but they refuse to debate him . . . This is the one book on the JFK assassination that no major publisher dared print . . . Despite all this, those open - minded individuals who have dared to rea d Final Judgment — including some very well - known names — have concluded that this book is the one book that most completely outlines the entirety of the conspiracy that took the life of John F. Kennedy. Final Judgment presents what the author, Michael Collin s Piper, calls “the other side of the jigsaw puzzle” — the long - ignored, but otherwise freely available details (all found in “mainstream” literature), which present a stark new light on the circumstances surrounding JFK’s assassination. This book demonstrat es the strong likelihood Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, collaborated alongside the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate in the JFK assassination because President Kennedy was working to prevent Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons of mass destruction, a fact that remained a dark secret for decades. However, because it was not until the mid - 1980’s that the truth about President Kennedy’s behind - the - scenes war with Israel emerged, many otherwise diligent JFK assassination researchers never co nsidered the possibility Israel did have good reason to align with other powerful forces that wanted to remove JFK from the White House. Once you’ve read Final Judgment you will see the evidence of likely Israeli involvement is there. Although first publi shed in 1994, only one newspaper, a small Washington - based weekly, even mentioned the book. Despite that, Final Judgment has now sold more than 40,000 copies, achieving he proverbial status of “underground” bestseller.

For ten years Israeli propagandists called Final Judgment author Michael Collins Piper a \"liar\" and an \"anti - Semite\" for charging that Israeli intelligence played a role in the JFK assassination conspiracy because of JFK's bitter secret conflict with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion over Israel's efforts to build nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Certain self - styled “JFK assassination researchers\" scoffed at Piper and refused to address the thesis of his book. However, on July 25, 2004, many of Piper's critics were red - faced and silent when Israel's respected Jerusalem Post carried a story headlined: \"Vanunu: Israel behind JFK Assassination.\" The newspaper reported that famed Jewish - born nuclear physicist, Dr. Mordechai Vanunu, recently released after spending 18 years in prison for exposing Israel's covert atomic weapons program — had charged that supporters of Israel's drive for nuclear weapons were involved in the JFK assassination precisely because of JFK's interference with their ambit ions. The Israeli government dismissed Vanunu's allegations, but what he said received attention in newspapers worldwide, with the notable exception of the United States where one and only one newspaper, mentioned Vanunu's charges and that was American Fre e Press, the Washington - based weekly that published Final Judgment. However, as widely read Internet writer, Rev. Mark Dankof, put it quite correctly: \"The Vanunu - Piper allegations about Israel will not go away.\" New Evidence Ties Israel's Nuclear Weapons Program to The New Orleans Connection in the JFK Conspiracy . . . As the second printing of the sixth edition of this book went to press, a source with intimate, high - level knowledge about the NUMEC nuclear plant in Pennsylvania that smuggled nuclear mat eriel to Israel (see Chapter 8) provided documentation to Michael Collins Piper that the family of Edith Rosenwald Stern, a prominent New Orleans Jewish leader, were key financiers behind NUMEC. Mrs. Stern was the closest friend of Clay Shaw, the longtime CIA asset charged by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in the JFK conspiracy. Final Judgment had already documented Shaw's ties to Israeli intelligence, so the NUMEC - Stern connection is all the more damning and, with other data, explains why Garri son ultimately concluded there was an Israeli connection behind the conspiracy. And note this: Another NUMEC investor was Pittsburgh's CIA - connected \"right wing\" billionaire Richard Scaife, whose protégé, Joe Farah, a vocal supporter of Israel, promoted a JFK conspiracy book evidently designed to distract attention from Final Judgment.

MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER MUST BE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT. Upon the first release of his book, Final Judgment, a storm of controversy erupted in the United States with certain \"pressure groups\" trying hard to ha ve the book banned. Since then, Final Judgment has gone through three more printings — and the controversy hasn't abated. We here in Australia believe that all theories on the JFK assassination should be heard, no matter whether you agree with them or not. H eck, we even bought and read Gerald Posner's Case Closed , and there isn't a more outlandish theory than his! Trying to get another book banned because you don't agree with it, or it isn't Politically Correct (the greatest censorship drive of the 80s and 90 s), is just the kind of thing we fight against. It's just the same as groups such as the FBI and CIA \"redacting\" lines of text here and there. People in glass theories shouldn't throw books, so to speak. So, we here at Probable Cause are proud to review Fi nal Judgment and hope that we never go down the path of the \"American Model\" — freedom of speech and the First Amendment and all that — yeah, okay, until you start speaking out and stepping on other people's toes. They line you up for a takedown. Boy, does Mic hael Collins Piper know about that! Okay, so after that little editorial, what is Final Judgment about? Piper's thesis is that Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad, played a key role in the assassination alongside the CIA and organized crime. Throughou t his presidency, JFK was involved in an increasingly bitter behind - the - scenes dispute with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion over Israel's steadfast determination to build a nuclear arsenal. JFK wanted them to stop. But they had other ideas. Sound f ar - fetched? Well, actually, you'll be surprised how many well - known \"JFK assassination players\" have links to the Mossad and we were quite impressed with the documented evidence within the book. Still, you'll have to read this one for yourself to decide. P iper is under attack from the ADL in the U.S. for this book and, really, it's not warranted. Did the French community in the U.S. get upset when it was suggested there was a French connection in the assassination? No. But then again, perhaps they don't hav e the lobbying power of the ADL.

Final Judgment is the most thorough, most honest, most penetrating, most factual, and most analytically complete and systematic of all that I have read s o far. \"The author builds an upwardly spiraling tapestry of well documented facts that connect the threads of the conspiracy as they ascend level by level from the ground up to the very tip of the pyramid. Along the way, he breaks the conspiracy into easil y digestible parts. Otherwise its sheer complexity would be nearly impossible to follow and decipher. At each level, the threads of the puzzle are woven together in such a way that the fog from the labyrinth is slowly but inexorably lifted until eventually it is peeled back completely and the outlines of the conspiracy are laid bare. What is revealed is as convincing as it is scary. \"Someday America will have to face some unpleasant truths about its democracy and about how it has been, and continues to be m anipulated, if not completely commandeered by those whose primary loyalties lie elsewhere. While the links at some of the levels may be tenuous, the author refuses to `fake or fudge the data’ or to be `fatally selective’ in what is included or left out — as was so clearly the case in Gerald Posner's Case Closed, or indeed as was the case in the Warren Commission's own flawed report. Piper is intrepid in following his analysis to every logical conclusion — wherever they lead and whatever the implications may be. \"In short, Piper keeps his eye on the donut (`Big Picture’) and not on the hole (inessential details). He focuses on the `why and how’ of the conspiracy and unmistakably the threads all lead back to Israel, Israeli super - patriots, the Meyer Lansky led `Je wish branch of the mob,’ and the Mossad and the international `agents of influence’ under its control. \"While serious researchers may quibble with inessential details in the study, such as tenuous links at some levels, or redundancies at others, those of u s who have studied this issue since the days after the assassination always knew that the truth would have its own resonance — like the Garrison investigation did.

The document was in an envelope (with no return address) postmarked \"Dallas, Texas.\" Entitled \"T he Kennedy Assassination and Israel: Some Dallas Connections,\" the document — apparently the work of a professional journalist — focused on \"the specifics of how the Israelis could have influenced the events in Dallas,\" filling in details never explored in pre vious editions of Final Judgment. The data is quite explosive, particularly when contrasted with the mythology regarding \"Big D\" repeated ad infinitum in JFK literature. However, understanding the real Dallas — not the city of legend and of Hollywood drama — p repares one for the revelations laid forth in Final Judgment. The document buries the tired old myth that a clique of anti - Semitic White Anglo - Saxon Protestant oil plutocrats ruled Dallas. Instead, the truth is quite the opposite. Not only did Dallas have an immensely powerful Jewish community, but, more importantly, the city (and Texas) had been a major center of fundraising and arms smuggling on behalf of the Zionist cause, going back to the 1940s. Even Jonathan Pollard, the American spy for Israel, said he was inspired to pro - Israel activism by stories he heard (while living in Texas) of gunrunning for the Israeli underground by Jews in Texas. In fact, the official published history of a major Zionist arms smuggling operation, the Sonneborn Institute, rep orts its agents smuggled aircraft parts out of Texas to Israel. This was happening when a then recently discharged Army Air Corps aircraft mechanic, Jack Ruby, was re - settling in Dallas in 1947, the year prior to Israel's birth, when Sonneborn's activities were at a zenith. Ruby bragged of having run arms to Israel and, in 1963, is now known to have part of an arms smuggling operation overseen by an Israeli intelligence officer. So the Israeli connection to Texas was a lot more intimate than many today ever realized. In 1963, JFK's primary interest in Dallas was raising money from the Dallas elite, and that meant the wealthy pro - Israel Jewish Democrats who were major financial angels for the ruling Democratic Party there. And since JFK was, at that time, at loggerheads with Israel over its nuclear arms program, it is critical to recognize how JFK was lured to Dallas and who was in charge of the arrangements that actually facilitated his assassination. And while it is well known that the Dallas leg of JFK's Te xas trip was sponsored by the Citizens Council (CC), the elite business group that ruled Dallas, the little - noticed evidence shows that two of the three key figures who dominated the CC were Jewish — not \"WASPs,\" as the legend of Dallas would have it. These were the folks who really ran Dallas, not the conservatives affiliated with the John Birch Society, as the old myth suggests. In 1963, one of those Jewish power brokers was an outspokenly pro - Israel liquor wholesaler, Julius Schepps, who held the distribut ion rights in Dallas for the Bronfman family's Seagram's products. And as we shall see, there is evidence that Jack Ruby was on the payroll of the Bronfman family, whose fingerprints are to be found all over the JFK assassination conspiracy. The means by w hich the Dallas elite gained control of JFK's Dallas trip agenda is interesting. Since JFK's Dallas trip was officially designated as \"non political\" — in contrast to other Texas stops such as Houston and Austin which were designated as \"political\" — the priva te entities paying for the Dallas trip gained control of the planning (taking it out of the hands of the JFK - controlled Democratic National Committee). The CC designated a \"host committee.\" The chairman was Dallas Jewish leader and public relations man, S am Bloom, the CC's longtime executive director, and — in retrospect — one of the least known but most pivotal figures in world history."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"There was an immediate confrontation between Bloom, representing the Dallas elite, and Jerry Bruno, JFK's veteran advance ma n. Bruno wanted the president to speak at the Women's Building, but the rulers of Dallas insisted JFK speak at the Trade Mart. Although Bruno fought long and hard, after much pressure, the Dallas elite prevailed, causing the JFK loyalist to comment that \"t his was one of the few fights like this that I had lost. On things like this my judgment was usually taken. This time it wasn't.\" By forcing JFK to speak at the Trade Mart, the Dallas elite positioned the JFK motorcade to take the now - infamous \"dog - leg\" tu rn into what was a classically sniper - friendly \"kill zone\" on Elm Street just below the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD), from where it later was claimed the alleged assassin, TSBD employee Lee Harvey Oswald, fired the fatal shots. The spot was also in easy range of the \"grassy knoll\" and the nearby Dal - Tex Building, where assassination researchers believe snipers were located. Had JFK's advance man prevailed — as he usually did — JFK (on his way to the preferred location) would have traveled two blocks fart her away from the TSBD — out of the kill zone — at a greater speed. Although the Secret Service objected (for security reasons) to the publication of JFK's motorcade route, Bloom (the point man for the Dallas elite) nonetheless made sure a map of the route was repeatedly published in Dallas papers. Thus, later, when the \"patsy\" was in custody, there was a plausible explanation as to how he knew JFK would pass by his workplace. That an assassin quite probably fired on JFK from the Dal - Tex Building is most releva nt in the context of an Israeli connection. Co - owned by David Weisblat, a major financial backer of the Israeli lobby's Anti - Defamation League, Dal - Tex housed, on different floors, a number of firms that utilized the telephone number of Morty Freedman, an attorney, garment manufacturer, and activist in Jewish affairs. Since JFK was working to stop Israel's nuclear arms program — which received smuggled uranium from U.S. sources — it is notable that one Dal - Tex firm linked to Freedman was the Dallas Uranium & Oi l Company. It is also intriguing that one of Freedman's Dal - Tex business partners was Abe Zapruder, the Jewish dress manufacturer who filmed the assassination and profited immensely. Today there are some who now believe Zapruder had advance knowledge of th e assassination. Once the accused assassin was in custody, it was — you guessed it — Sam Bloom, who had earlier maneuvered JFK into the kill zone, who pressured Elgin Crull, the city manager, to in turn pressure Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry into making Oswa ld accessible to the press and to move him publicly from the Dallas police station to the city jail. Thus, the situation was in place for Jack Ruby to move in for the kill. There are several sources, including Dallas FBI agent James Hosty, who stated Bloom and his backers were the forces behind this. When the police searched Ruby's home, they found a slip of paper with Bloom's name, address and telephone number on it. So it is that the Dallas myth comes to an end. This will be painful for those who thought the city an anti - Jewish stronghold, ripe for Nazi revolution. Instead, Dallas was actually an outpost for the advancement of the interests of Israel and today it very much remains so. Although Walt Brown suggested in Treachery in Dallas that the city's eli te were prime movers behind the events of November 22, 1963, he rushed to write elsewhere that the JFK assassination \"wasn't done by Mossad . . . as some would have us believe\" (referring to Final Judgment). However, in light of the \"Big Picture of Big D\" — details Brown ignored (or suppressed) in terms of their ultimate (and critical) context — it's time for real JFK assassination truth seekers to take a new look at Final Judgment."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"A Note from the Publisher . . . * \"When Final Judgment was temporarily out of print, second - hand book dealers were selling copies over the Internet for as much as $185 each. And this is a book that certain people refuse to acknowledge even exists!\" Few people know it, but it takes as few as 40,000 copies to be sold for a book to re ach the New York Times best - seller list. What far fewer people know — but book dealers can attest to it — is that there have actually even been books listed by the Times as \"best sellers\" even though the books have n o t y e t a c t u a l l y b e e n p r i n t e d ! A d v a n c e o r d e r s f r o m b o o k dealers — presumably — make this unusual phenomenon possible. Whatever the case, there's much more to the story behind the story of \"best - sellers\" than meets the eye. And it's a story that most of the major names in the publishing industry probably would prefer left untold. Nonetheless, a number of books dealing with the JFK assassination have reached the Times' list. Interestingly enough, though, Mark Lane's ground - breaking international best - seller, Rush to Judgment — which did reach the Times list — w as never once reviewed by the Times, which tells us that it is the source of \"all the news that's fit to print,\" until long after the book had become an international cause celebre. In more recent years, particularly in the wake of the release of Oliver St one's Hollywood blockbuster, JFK, several more volumes did reach the Times' best - seller list. Final Judgment was not one of those volumes. This despite the fact that nearly 8,000 copies of Final Judgment were sold within two weeks of the book's release in January of 1994 — this as a response to a single advertisement in a relatively small national weekly newspaper. Since then, no more than 300 copies of the book were purchased in bulk by dealers. All other sales were to individual buyers. In one instance, how ever, an enthusiastic reader purchased 100 additional copies after his favorable reception of the first two copies he ordered. Now, as a result of direct mail promotions, many thousands more copies of Final Judgment are being sold across the country with m ore than 40,000 copies in circulation. When the book was temporarily out of print — in the fall of 2003 — there was so much demand that second - hand copies were being sold by used book dealers over the Internet for as much — at one point — as $185 a copy. Clearly, there's obviously a little bit of interest in a book that some people don't even want to admit exists! That Final Judgment has already sold so exceedingly well is quite remarkable, considering the general lack of publicity that the book has received. One m uch - touted JFK assassination work, The Plot to Kill the President, by former House Assassinations Committee director G. Robert Blakey, received widespread national promotion when it was released by a New York Times book publishing affiliate in 1981. Yet, B lakey's book, ___________________________ *Authored by the American Free Press , publisher of the soft cover edition"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Foreword according to Blakey himself, sold only some 20,000 copies — far less than Final Judgment which received no mass media promotion what soever. So if you've never read anything about the JFK assassination, Final Judgment will be the only book you ever need read on the subject. If, on the other hand, you have read one or more earlier volumes on the subject, you'll be amazed at the explosive new revelations appearing in Final Judgment. Don't look for analysis of \"where the shots came from\" or \"how many shots were fired\" or \"how many assassins were involved.\" None of that appears here. Dissecting the assassination conspiracy in its entirety, F inal Judgment ties together little - known details that have been ignored or misunderstood (or even covered up) by other authors — whether by accident or by design. Final Judgment focuses on the most important question of all: Who was ultimately responsible fo r the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Once you've read Final Judgment, you'll never look at the JFK assassination the same way again. And you may never again trust the media to tell you all of the facts about any other important event that shaped the cou rse of history. Above all, you'll understand how the JFK assassination conspiracy evolved as it did and why — at least until the advent of Final Judgment — the truth had never been told. It is important to note that since the first release of Final Judgment, o nly a handful of minor errors have been brought to the author's attention. The errors, however, had nothing whatsoever to do with the thesis of the book and were based on the research of others. Those errors have been corrected. Otherwise the conclusions r eached remain unchanged. Final Judgment stands unchallenged. The only criticism has been ad homenim. Yet, name - calling does not a successful challenge make. If anything, hysterical and malicious defamation — especially considering the sources — lends credence, in its own way, to the thesis of the book. So there is indeed much more to be learned about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Final Judgment points the direction for those who wish to pursue the matter further. Final Judgment is — at least for the time being — precisely what its title suggests. Michael Collins Piper has done the work necessary to assemble this volume. Now it is up to the readers to make sure that the message imparted within these pages reaches the widest audience possible. When you've fini shed the book, pass it on to a friend. Order extra copies to donate to libraries and to give to opinion makers in your community. Write letters to the editors of local newspapers about the book. Call radio talk shows. Let the American people know the truth . It's all up to you. This book, if read by enough people, could play a major part — just as did the assassination of President Kennedy — in reshaping the course of world affairs.

Brock A Black American's Perspective on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy As an Americ an of African slave descent, as a U.S. Army veteran of World War II, and as a long - time laborer within the African - American community, I have a special interest in finding out precisely who killed President John F. Kennedy and why. John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert Kennedy, put a great deal on the line when they stepped forward and identified themselves with the cause of justice for Blacks in America. To be sure, Jack and Bobby were savvy politicians, conscious of the growing and increasingly influent ial Black voting bloc in America. Thus, for reasons of their own, they had made a conscious decision to align themselves politically with Americans of African slave descent. However, at the same time Jack and Bobby also truly believed that it was time that the Black man and Black woman in America deserved an even break. Through their words and — more significantly — through their actions, the Kennedy brothers were bringing a previously - disenfranchised people under the protection of the Kennedy dynasty. Had John Kennedy lived and been elected to a second term, the Black voting bloc — for years to come — would have ultimately become part of a Kennedy political powerhouse. Throughout the 20th century the Black political apparatus in America was dominated at the highest levels — particularly in the all - important financial realm — by Jewish influence. Organizations such as the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, one of the foremost elements in the powerful Israeli lobby, aggressively dictated the internal affairs an d the public course and discourse of what were ostensibly \"Black\" — or, in the parlance of the day, \"Negro\" — civil rights organizations. However, with the advent of the Kennedy presidency, Americans of African slave descent now had an effective and eloquent s pokesman in the White House itself. This essentially had the effect of moving the ADL, for example, out of the loop. The ADL was no longer the \"middleman\" divvying up the civil rights crumbs for Blacks in America. John F. Kennedy, for all intents and purpo ses, had emerged as a white \"mainstream\" voice for Black America's political empowerment. As President of the United States, speaking out on behalf of Black concerns, John F. Kennedy short - circuited the long - time domination of the Black community by Jewish financial interests and placed himself in the center of the civil rights debate. The ADL and other \"civil rights\" organizations funded by the Jewish financial interests were pushed aside and made irrelevant. A white man of Irish Catholic descent — the grand son of a saloon"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"keeper — became Black America's unlikely spokesman and co - opted the Jewish overseers of the civil rights movement in America. As a consequence, I do believe — as do many other Americans of African slave descent — that this is one of the reasons that the powers - that - be within America's plutocratic elite determined that John F. Kennedy's presidency had to be brought to premature closure. What's more, all of this came at a time when independent Black voices such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were themselves rising in popularity and influence — much, it seems, to the dismay of the Jewish community. We now know that although we have heard much in the media about J. Edgar Hoover's war on Dr. King, it was the ADL that was providing the foot soldiers for this war — a fact that the ADL would much prefer be kept under wraps. A former ADL official has admitted (and as Michael Collins Piper documents in Final Judgment ) it was the ADL that was actually doing much of the surveillance of Dr. King, the illicit fruits of which, in turn, were channeled by the ADL to J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Dr. King and Malcolm X and others knew the way of the Black ghetto. They understood how Black America was being manipulated. They knew how the drug and gambling and prostitution rackets of Meyer Lansky — a major ADL contributor — were eviscerating Black America. They dared to speak out. For that, both Martin and Malcolm ultimately paid the price. When all is said and done, there's no question in my mind that we will find that those wh o slew those dreamers were also behind the murder of John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby. This is why I take great pleasure in penning this brief introduction to Michael Collins Piper's remarkable book. I believe that Final Judgment provides the answer t o the mystery of who really killed John F. Kennedy — and why. I will say this for the record: I have nothing but contempt for those cowardly white liberals who portray themselves as admirers of JFK's stand on civil rights and say that they want to find the r eal murderers of President Kennedy but who otherwise ignore or suppress the facts put forth in Final Judgment. They are frauds and phonies. They are afraid of the truth. They are profiteers who are trading on the death of President Kennedy but covering up all of the facts that are there before them. There is no other book ever written that explains the JFK assassination conspiracy so honestly or which makes everything about the JFK assassination conspiracy so crystal clear. Once you've read Final Judgment y ou'll understand the big picture. Michael Collins Piper has stepped right up into the footlights of center stage and, like one of those great Broadway impresarios, Piper has presented a spell - binding scenario outlining the entirety of the JFK assassination conspiracy more powerful and more convincing than any before. I think you'll agree. ROBERT L. BROCK, Founder The Self - Determination Committee"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Acknowledgements — and Intrigue . . . Having written a book on such a \"controversial\" topic as the JFK assassinat ion — coupling that subject with a highly \"sensational\" thesis — has proven quite an adventure. It has been rewarding, if not sometimes frustrating. It's brought me a lot of new friends — and lots of enemies, too! Since the first edition was released, I've recei ved so many letters of congratulation and appreciated comments of many people I respect who have said — as one put it: \"I think you've pinned the tail on the donkey.\" Never having styled myself as an \"expert\" on the JFK assassination, I protest when anyone i ntroduces me as such. In fact, despite what many have assumed, the subject has never been a particular preoccupation of mine. There are others who have devoted much more time to the topic. And I am very familiar with their work. However, there are many JFK assassination researchers who refuse to admit that there is even any basis for my thesis. There are those who don't wish to even acknowledge the very existence of this book — it's that \"controversial.\" In the pages that follow, I pull no punches in naming n ames or pointing out why I believe some \"researchers\" are disingenuous and perhaps even compromised, bought off by the forces responsible for the JFK assassination. I don't believe I'm overstating the case at all. Some fools have suggested Final Judgment i s \"Arab propaganda.\" No Arab government or financial interest — or even any Arab - American source — had any hand in preparing, publishing or distributing this book. Only in later 2001 — a full year after the publication of the fifth English - language edition — did a privately owned Arabic - language publishing house issue a translation of the book. This work is mine alone. Some critics pointed out that I was an employee of Liberty Lobby, the populist institution that published the (now - defunct) national weekly newspape r, The Spotlight. These critics note that Liberty Lobby questioned U.S. favoritism toward Israel. All of this is true. However, for this I make no apologies nor, for that matter, are any apologies due. In fact, as this new edition of Final Judgment is bein g delivered to the publisher, the global media is focused on Israel and the Middle East . . . and the publications and voices of the Israeli lobby in America are crying (true or not) that \"The Whole World is Against Us.\" So, it was precisely my association with Liberty Lobby that enabled me to gain special insights — particularly vis - à - vis U.S. policy toward Israel — which assisted tremendously in the preparation of this book. Other JFK researchers have not had this unusual advantage. What's more, as you'll see in Final Judgment, Liberty Lobby became embroiled in a heated libel trial after ex - CIA figure E. Howard Hunt brought a lawsuit against Liberty Lobby for publishing an article alleging the CIA intended to frame Hunt for involvement in the JFK assassination ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Acknowledgments — and Intrigue . . . Handling The Spotlight's successful defense, appropriately enough, was Mark Lane, dean of the Warren Commission critics. Lane put aside presumed ideological differences with Liberty Lobby and skillfully used the Hunt case to explore the JFK assassinati on in a legal forum — the first such opportunity since Jim Garrison's ill - fated prosecution of Clay Shaw. Thus, following the Hunt case from the \"inside\" — and later studying Lane's account of the affair in Plausible Denial — gave me a unique vantage point other s haven't had. I thank Mark Lane — and Willis Carto, the founder of Liberty Lobby — for this opportunity. Willis Carto's encouragement and enthusiasm were most important in making this book possible. The title for Final Judgment was his suggestion and right on target. As for Mark Lane, let it be noted that had he not written one word after Rush to Judgment — the book that proved the Warren Commission Report a fraud — we would still be indebted to Mark for that alone. Although many books from others came later, Mark 's singular crusade convinced the world there was much more to the story. Mark and his one - of - a - kind wife, Trish, are tremendous human beings and valued friends. In Final Judgment you will also meet another remarkable individual: a former French intellige nce officer who provided me with stunning \"inside\" information that forced me to rewrite the first draft of Final Judgment, thereby bringing my thesis full circle. Had it not been for his input, this book would not be complete. The name of my French source , Pierre Neuville, was unveiled for the first time in the fifth edition of Final Judgment, but the Mossad — of course — knew his identity from the beginning. Although the first draft presented — I think — a compelling indictment of Mossad complicity in the JFK ass assination, my French source pointed me in a direction that convinced me — and many readers — that Final Judgment was on the mark. History owes a debt to the well - known and respected former U.S. congressman, Paul Findley — a liberal, no \"right - wing extremist\" — wh o introduced me to this French source and vouched for his credibility. Only recently did I formally identify Findley as the conduit, but, again, it was no mystery to those who make it their business to know these things. Another former U.S. Congressman — the late John G. Schmitz — told me of his own long - time suspicion of Mossad involvement in the JFK assassination (based on his own inquiries) and encouraged me to write this book, saying it was a book he would have liked to have written. A rather colorful inter national businessman intimately associated with several prominent figures mentioned in Final Judgment gave me a rather firm endorsement of this book's thesis, saying succinctly: \"I think that's pretty much what happened.\" Considering this gentleman's conne ctions, his assessment is very telling indeed.

Stephen Green, Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, and Seymour Hersh, in their own studies of U.S. Middle East policy ( Taking Sides, Dangerous Liaison, and The Samson Option, res pectively), provided the foundation upon which much of my own research was conducted. In 1998 — four years after the first release of Final Judgment — Israeli historian Avner Cohen, author of Israel and the Bomb, came along and his book (certainly unintentiona lly) has given great credence to my thesis. Cohen told a mutual acquaintance — I'm sure he'd be shocked to know we even know somebody mutually — that he was horrified to learn (while doing an Internet search for data on his own book) about the existence of Fin al Judgment and its thesis. Of course, Cohen rushed to assert his view that rejects the idea of Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination, but the genie is out of the bottle and the world now knows that Israel and JFK were not the \"special friends\" some would have us believe. A little - noticed — but important — book, There's a Fish in the Courthouse, by Gary Wean, enriched my own work considerably. Unfortunately, Gary now claims my book \"plagiarized\" his and that I was \"forced\" to acknowledge his work, which, of course, was clearly quoted and cited and prominently acknowledged from the start. Nobody \"forced\" me into giving his book the recognition it was due.

Com One of t he problems with writing a book is that no matter how hard an author researches his subject, he's bound to miss a few significant items the first time around. Since Final Judgment was first released in 1994, I've repeatedly kicked myself for having passed by more than a few such details that I believe lend credence to the theory that this book puts forth. Up through and including the fourth edition of Final Judgment, I repeatedly made the point that former New Orleans Jim Garrison who prosecuted trade execu tive Clay Shaw for conspiracy in the JFK assassination had no inkling of any Mossad connection to the assassination. But it now seems that I was wrong. After the fourth edition of Final Judgment was released, I made the somewhat unsettling discovery that G arrison apparently did indeed realize that the Mossad was connected to the conspiracy — and the information had been there for me to find it, if I had looked in the right place. Although I had scanned the quite extensive Internet web site of veteran JFK assa ssination researcher A. J. Weberman ( www.weberman.com ) I found something which amazed me, to say the least. On his web site, Weberman made the following remarkable assertion: This researcher knew Jim Garrison in the mid - 1970's. Garrison wanted me to find a publisher for a manuscript he had written on the assassination of P r e s i d e n t J o h n F . K e n n e d y . W h e n I r e a d t h e manuscript I found that it was a fictional work that placed the blame for John Kennedy's death on the Moss ad — the Israeli intelligence service. Considering all the grief to which I had been subjected over the past several years — even including criticism coming from some defenders of the Garrison investigation — I could barely believe what I had read. If A. J . Weberman is to be believed, Jim Garrison himself had indeed figured out — somehow, not surprisingly — that there was good reason to believe that the Mossad had been involved in the crime of the century."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"But Garrison himself evidently concluded (quite cor rectly, I might add) that it was not in his interests to say so — at least not publicly and certainly not in any of his non - fiction writings on the subject. So Garrison decided instead to put his thesis in a novel, but it was a novel that obviously was never published. I doubt that Garrison's family will be attempting to put the unpublished manuscript (if it still exists) on the market any time soon. Weberman's revelation is sure to make many defenders of Jim Garrison uncomfortable, but it does provide astoun ding confirmation that the thesis that has been put forth in Final Judgment does have some genuine support from a figure who has become both a villain and an icon in the lore of the JFK assassination conspiracy. Garrison's reported theorizing of Mossad inv olvement does not, of course, prove that the Mossad was involved in the JFK assassination, but it does lend credence to what has been so widely criticized (but without refutation, I might add) in the pages of Final Judgment. The question, naturally, arises : was Weberman lying about Garrison's Mossad theory, and if so, why would Weberman make this allegation? This is not for me to answer. I am only here to tell you that this is what Weberman has said. If Weberman is not lying, are we then to believe that Gar rison was simply having some sort of twisted fun, that he concocted this scenario for his own peculiar purposes? This, of course, seems highly unlikely. Thus we are left with the fact of what Weberman has alleged about Garrison's apparent suppositions, cou pled with the reality that Final Judgment has now come forth documenting the \"how\" and the \"why\" of Mossad involvement in the JFK assassination conspiracy. And as much as it may dismay Israel and its powerful lobby in America, represented by the Anti - Defam ation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith and other powerful forces, there are a lot of people — in growing numbers — who do believe that Final Judgment presents a scenario that does make sense, one that makes as much sense or more than many of the other standard the ories on the subject, the ADL's hysterical efforts to silence me (but not refute me) notwithstanding. So despite the subtitle of my book, in a sense I actually initially missed \"the missing link in the JFK assassination conspiracy\" — the fact that Jim Garris on had indeed recognized the Mossad connection. Only now am I finally able to bring this vital detail to my readers. I only wish I had done it earlier. Keeping all of this in mind, I invite the readers of Final Judgment to read what I have written, and re - written, and revised and up - dated and to determine for themselves if Jim Garrison's apparent suspicions were indeed on the mark and that Israel and its Mossad were primary players alongside the CIA in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. — Michael Collins Piper Washington, DC"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"”The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzz le” A Foreword by the Author . . . O n August 21, 1997 a front - page article appeared in the Los Angeles Times describing an uproar in Southern California that erupted over my impending lecture at a community college seminar on the JFK assassination. The seminar was being held under the auspices of the South Orange County Community College District. Although four speakers were scheduled, it was my expected presence — my presence alone — that created the controversy. The Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B' rith was (not surprisingly) upset that I contend in this book, Final Judgment, that Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad, played a front - line role in the JFK assassination alongside the CIA and the Lansky Crime Syndicate. The Times reported that the A DL accused yours truly \"of being a proponent of Holocaust denial and labels his claim that Israelis killed Kennedy ridiculous.\" The ADL failed to cite any evidence of my being a \"proponent of Holocaust denial,\" but evidently the ADL considers that the ulti mate kiss of death and that such accusations are fair game when trying to silence anyone who runs afoul of its agenda. That the ADL presumes to label my charge of Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination as being \"ridiculous\" is downright laughable. In asmuch as the ADL not only functions as a major force in the Israeli lobby in the United States, but is also an intelligence and propaganda arm of the Mossad, it seems unlikely the ADL would ever endorse my thesis. In any case, as a direct result of intens e and highly hysterical clamor by the ADL, the JFK seminar was canceled, although college officials and others said publicly and forthrightly that they were concerned about the implications and consequences of the ADL's heavy - handed pressure campaign to re strict freedom of speech, particularly in an academic forum. Nonetheless, news reports about the affair appeared in newspapers nationwide, even including a Newsweek commentary by George Will, a strident supporter of Israel. So, as a consequence, I'm please d to say, there was a positive side to all of this. Now — for the first time since Final Judgment was published in 1994 — readers of \"mainstream newspapers\" across America have been told that there is a theory floating around out there that Israel's Mossad was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. As I told the Los Angeles Times and which was quoted in a second article on August 22: \"The Anti - Defamation League has not heard the last of Final Judgment. The door has been kicked open. There is now goin g to be a lot of debate about this book\" — whether the ADL likes it or not. Although the Los Angeles Times reporter, Michael Granberry, made some attempt to present my views, I do feel compelled, however, to comment on various aspects of the Los Angeles Tim es article, inasmuch as the whole story behind the article needs to be told."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Times quoted one Gerald Posner, the author of Case Closed, as an authority on JFK conspiracies. The fact is that Posner has been widely reviled by serious longtime JFK assass ination researchers for having written Case Closed which claims that the Warren Commission Report was correct (despite some flaws) and that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The cosmopolitan Mr. Posner was said to be \"aghast\" that the seminar was scheduled an d said \"This strikes me as being similar to the notion that the Holocaust was a hoax.\" This happens to be precisely the propaganda line now promoted by the ADL which has said that if people believe there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination, they might also end up believing that there was no Holocaust. ADL National Director Abe Foxman, writing in Antisemitism in America Today: Outspoken Experts Explode the Myths, stated forthrightly: \"If segments of the population are really willing to believe that President Kennedy was killed by the military - industrial complex because he was too soft on Communism . . . then it is not hard to imagine some of these same people falling for the lies of Bradley Smith or the fabrications of Louis Farrakhan and Leonard Je ffries. \"All of these conspiracy theories share the core feature that the `research' which supports them — little more, in fact, than a compendium of anecdotes divorced from their original context — is rigged to arrive at predetermined conclusions, not histori cal revelations or insights.\" (The aforementioned Smith, by the way, promotes the view, held even by so - called \"mainstream\" JFK assassination researcher Jim Marrs, that the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust has been over - stated. (Farrakhan and Jeff ries, of course, are outspoken Black figures who have documented a major Jewish role in the slave trade and have given the ADL much distress.) In short, if you believe in any JFK assassination conspiracy theory, you might actually believe something else ab out another matter — such as the Holocaust or the slave trade — that the ADL doesn't want you to believe. But back to the ADL's friend, Posner. In fact, Posner's book is little more than a rehash of the original Warren Commission Report supplemented with an of fensive mish - mash of virulent attacks on not only a number of JFK investigators but also citizens who came forth with credible evidence pointing toward a conspiracy behind the assassination of the president. But just who is Posner anyway? Why has he emerge d as a sort of fair - haired boy for the ADL and the other critics of Final Judgment (and JFK conspiracy theories in general)? The aforementioned Jim Marrs, the author of Crossfire, a popular compendium of JFK conspiracy theories, has been fiercely critical of Posner and he's been pretty public in those criticisms and he has his own opinions (worth citing) about where Posner is coming from. In the fall 1995 issue of Paranoia magazine, an expose of Posner reveals that Posner had privately admitted to Marrs tha t Bob Loomis, an executive at Random House, had approached Posner asking him to write a"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzzle . . . book on the JFK assassination, promising Posner that the CIA would open its own JFK assassination files to Posner so that he could write the book. As a consequence, M arrs has condemned Posner as a CIA front man. Why did Loomis ask Posner — out of all of the authors in the world — to write the book? According to Mans: \"Probably because [Posner] had been used as a CIA tool in his earlier book, Hitler's Children. In this book he interviewed the children of top Nazi leaders. How do you go about doing that? How do you find who they are? They've all changed their names. How do you locate them? Posner had to have been set up by the CIA for that book, too,\" says Marrs. Marrs is (ri ghtly) upset by the way the mainstream media promoted Posner's book on the 30th anniversary of the JFK assassination. It was then obvious (as it is today) that the media does want the public to believe that the JFK affair is a \"case closed.\" What is notabl e is that by far the biggest media push for Posner's book came in the August 30th 1993 issue of U.S. News & World Report, which gave the book a widely - advertised cover story. I'll probably upset some people by pointing out that U.S. News is owned by Mort Z uckerman, one of the most outspoken and powerful figures in the Israeli lobby in America. In an appendix in this edition of Final Judgment, I have analyzed Posner's book and showed precisely what a pathetic fraud it is. However, for those interested in a c omprehensive critique of Posner, I would heartily recommend Case Open by veteran JFK researcher Harold Weisberg. So much for Gerald Posner. Although he's not a reliable source (obviously), the Los Angeles Times took great delight in citing his critique of Final Judgment which Posner, the Times said, considers one of the more \"outlandish\" theories presented to date. The Los Angeles Times also quoted one Chip Berlet, whom it described as one \"who has studied the assassination extensively,\" and as a \"senior an alyst\" at a \"think tank . . . that examines authoritarian thinking.\" Berlet said that my views represented \"the outer limits.\" First of all, I am not aware of anything Berlet has ever written on the JFK assassination (other than random attacks on other JFK conspiracy theorists) so I know of no published evidence of his \"extensive study.\" This in stark contrast to what was, at that time, the 385 - page third edition of Final Judgment which was documented with 746 footnotes. Furthermore, the so - called \"think ta nk\" that employs Berlet has its own axes to grind. The Times failed to point this out when presenting Berlet as some sort of objective \"analyst.\" What the Times also failed to mention is that Berlet's \"think tank\" has been funded by at least two known CIA front companies. So we can see, even now, where Berlet is coming from. At this juncture I should also note that prominent \"New Left\" activists of the 1960's such as (the since - deceased) Ace Hayes, publisher of the Portland Free Press, and Daniel Brandt of the NameBase NewsLine newsletter, had long kept a close watch on Berlet and concluded that:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"1) There is no question that Berlet has collaborated closely with the ADL to the point that they consider him little more than a \"shill\" for the ADL and at worst, pos sibly one of its paid operatives; and 2) Berlet himself may also have covert connections to the CIA, including involvement with a CIA - financed \"student\" group of the 1960's. There are others who have pointed out that despite his preppy nickname, Berlet's real name is John Foster Berlet. He was named after former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who was apparently associated with Berlet's father. Dulles' brother, Allen, of course, was not only fired as CIA director by JFK but later went on to serve as a m ember of the Warren Commission which covered up the truth about the assassination. So inasmuch as Final Judgment indicts the CIA for collaborating with the Mossad in the JFK assassination we can understand why Berlet (and Posner) are eager to keep Final Ju dgment under wraps. Obviously, the ADL directed the Los Angeles Times to both Posner and Berlet, knowing that the two CIA - connected \"authorities\" would come through as they did. The Times also quoted Roy Bauer, a philosophy instructor, at the Irvine Valley College, as referring to me (and the other scheduled speakers at the conference) as \"crackpots.\" (It was Bauer, it seems, who originally called the ADL to complain about my impending presence at the seminar.) I am certain Bauer never read my book, so for him to accuse me of being a \"crackpot\" is malicious and baseless name - calling of the worst sort. What's more, although I am not familiar with the \"philosophy\" espoused in the classroom by the good professor it is clearly not a philosophy in line with the A merican tradition of freedom of speech. I made repeated efforts to contact Bauer to speak to him directly but he refused to return my calls. When I finally did reach Bauer, he told me that he had been \"advised\" not to speak with me and promptly hung up. Th is advice, I'm sure, came directly from Bauer's friends at the ADL. For years the ADL has maintained a policy of \"refusing to debate\" those it otherwise so feverishly attacks through the press. The anguished Bauer, evidently was comfortable throwing brickb ats from afar and by calling in the \"thought police\" at the ADL, but he didn't have the fortitude to confront me directly. The Los Angeles Times also reported, incidentally, that college trustee Steve Frogue, the sponsor of the ill - fated college seminar, h ad claimed some time ago that \"the ADL was behind\" the Kennedy assassination. Frogue did not say this. What Frogue, in fact, said was that there was evidence (clearly documented in Final Judgment) that it was possible that Lee Harvey Oswald's strange activ ities in New Orleans were part of one of the ADL's famous (or infamous) \"fact finding\" operations. The Times reporter (perhaps) misunderstood Frogue's remarks about the ADL's connection to Oswald, but now that misinterpretation has been reported again and again and has taken on a life of its own. But Frogue didn't say what he was alleged to have said. However, in Final Judgment Oswald's (surprising) ADL connection(s) are examined for the first time. Poor Mr. Frogue. As a young admirer of JFK, Frogue was pre paring to join the Peace Corps, inspired by Kennedy's New Frontier. Upon the death"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzzle . . . of the president, however, Frogue was so frustrated and disillusioned that he instead joined the Marine Corps. A high school teacher and community leader (and a part - time student of JFK conspiracy theories) Frogue thought that an academic forum — through the auspices of the South Orange County Community College District (of which he was elected president) — would be an ideal way to debate the theory presented in Final Judgment, along with other competing theories — including one that \"The Nazis Killed JFK.\" But the ADL thought otherwise. They had no desire to allow college students and other interested participants to even hear what I had to say. They considered the thesis of Fina l Judgment so dangerous that they did all in their immense power to prevent me from being heard. Thus, Steve Frogue's project was scuttled through a smear campaign against me and against this decent man that he probably never imagined possible. The Los Ang eles Times did correctly report my comment that JFK was involved in a fierce battle with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion over Israel's efforts to build a nuclear arsenal. The young reporter, Mike Granberry, had asked me specifically (and it was a g ood question, needless to say): \"My editors want to know why you think that Israel would be opposed to John F. Kennedy?\" So I told him and he reported my response. What the Times did not report was that I had additionally noted that upon JFK's death U.S. p olicy toward Israel under Lyndon Johnson did a complete and immediate 180 - degree turnabout and that — most importantly — Israel's nuclear bomb program went forward unimpeded. As I told the Times (but which was not reported): \"Although there is some debate abou t whether or not the U.S. would have remained involved in Vietnam had JFK lived, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever about the drastic reversal in U.S. Middle East policy from which Israel was the prime beneficiary.\" I pointed out to the Times that fou r prominent authors, Seymour Hersh, Stephen Green and Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, wrote extensively about JFK's policy toward Israel and that I relied almost exclusively upon their findings. I did not say, as the Times further reported, that I disputed the much - reported figure that \"six million Jews\" died at the hands of the Nazis, nor did I ever once allude to claims that the figure is actually much lower. What I said was this: \"First of all, my book is about the JFK assassination. It has nothing to do wit h the Holocaust. The JFK assassination took place in 1963. The Holocaust ended in 1945. My views on what did or did not take place during the Holocaust have nothing to do with my book on the JFK assassination. It is another subject altogether. \"As far as t he numbers are concerned,\" I pointed out, \"I have heard the figure of Six Million all of my life. You can't turn around without reading something about it in the press all of the time. However,\" I added, \"in recent years, some Jewish historians have claime d that the figure is as high as seven million or even eight million. So I don't know what the figure is.\" (For an example of such a claim that the figure may be as high as seven million, see the ever - august Washington Post of November 20, 1996, the issue o f the highly reputable Jerusalem Post for the week ending November"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"23, 1996 and the May 23 - May 30, 1997 edition of the New York - based Jewish Press — all of which are considered quite \"responsible\" by the ADL.) At no time did I ever suggest to the Los Angele s Times that I believed, as the Times falsely reported, \"that no Jews were killed in gas chambers.\" This was literary license on the part of the reporter who presumed that these were my views based upon what the ADL had already (falsely) told him my views happened to be on this irrelevant issue. Despite all this, of course, my JFK book had nothing to do with the Holocaust, the ADL's false and malicious rantings notwithstanding. And it's probably worth noting that a handful of characters who are self - styled Holocaust revisionists — \"Holocaust deniers\" in the parlance of the ADL — have not only tried to stop distribution of Final Judgment and discredit it, but these same intriguers successfully sabotaged a pending Russian - language translation of the book! So much, then, for this nonsense about \"the Holocaust.\" Frankly, I doubt very much that if I happened to be \"pro - choice\" on the issue of abortion that the Catholic Church would have, on that basis, launched a major smear campaign to stop me from speaking on the un - related subject of the JFK assassination. So therefore, again, we have to wonder precisely why the ADL was so adamantly opposed to my lecture being heard and then dragged in the irrelevant issue of \"the Holocaust.\" The answer is obvious. When all is said and done, the ADL's hysterical reaction to Final Judgment validates the thesis of this book. It's that simple. The Los Angeles Times made reference to another proposed speaker at the scuttled seminar, John Judge, and pointed out that he was known for his a dherence to \"the conspiracies theories of the late New Orleans Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison\" and that \"those theories had no anti - Semitic overtones.\" What is interesting to note is that Judge refused to permit me to speak at a JFK conference that he organized here in Washington in October of 1996. The diplomatic excuse at the time (in the words of Judge's associate, Philip Melanson) was that the program at that conference was \"attempting to focus on evidentiary issues and questions rather than broad historical themes and theories.\" However, Judge's associates told one attendee, who asked why Final Judgment wasn't on display at that conference: \"Neither Michael Collins Piper nor his book are welcome here.\" Ultimately, when Judge's name was linked with mine in pre ss reports, Judge rushed off a letter to the Orange County Register to assure its readers that he and his colleagues would certainly not have anything to do with an extremist like me. Yet, even Judge is in the soup as far as the ADL is concerned: after all , Judge, too, believes in a conspiracy theory — and that's baaaaad! Thus, I find it quite amusing that Judge has now been labeled a \"crackpot\" alongside me. Likewise with another individual who was scheduled to speak at the seminar in California — one Dave Emo ry — who contends the Nazis were behind JFK's assassination. I won't burden the reader with commentary here on that peculiar notion, although in Chapter 15 of Final Judgment I do provide some interesting information about Emory's so - called \"Nazi connection\" which proves it was anything but that."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzzle . . . In fact, the thesis presented in Final Judgment, if anything, vindicates Jim Garrison's indictment of Clay Shaw for involvement in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Garrison first pinpointed the role of Clay Shaw in the conspiracy and, in Chapter 15, Shaw's Israeli connections are outlined in sharp detail. However, I must say that the theory presented in Final Judgment does not hinge on Clay Shaw. With or without Shaw there is firm evidence in many, many other areas that points in the direction of Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination. However, Shaw's complicity in the conspiracy simply brings things full circle, as you'll see. As far as the suggestion by the Times that my thesis has \"anti - Semitic overtones,\" I will say this: I don't think the book is \"anti - Israel\" or \"anti - Semitic.\" Period. To criticize the actions of Israel and its lobby in this country is not \"anti - Semitic\" and common - sense people who have no fanatical religious or political axes to grind rea lize this. One reviewer, Kenn Thomas, in his conspiracy theory journal, Steamshovel Press, commented that \"the book cannot be read without trying to identify the fine line of an anti - Israel/anti - Zionist critique with old - fashioned anti - Semitism.\" I think t hat's nonsense. However, to be perfectly honest, I have to think that Thomas made that remark (in the context of a grudgingly friendly review) simply in hopes of avoiding being called an \"anti - Semite\" himself for suggesting (as he did) that the reader coul d learn a great deal about JFK's little - known behind - the - scenes struggle with Israel by reading the book. You see, there are a lot of cowards out there among self - styled conspiracy researchers: \"Mossad involvement? Oh no!\" they cry, and then add, whisperin g among themselves: \"But, if there was, by all means don't say it. We'll be discredited in our research.\" Poor folks. Israel, in my view, is just another foreign country and doesn't deserve any special treatment any more than Ireland or Iceland. However, t here is a very strong pro - Israel lobby in America (which includes some of its strongest backers such very Christian men as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) and as a consequence, Israel has immense power over U.S. foreign policy making. Because of that \"spe cial relationship\" Israel does occupy a unique position that has put Israel right there in the line of fire to be pummeled with criticism. Israel is not above reproach and because it wishes to exert its influence it must expect to be criticized. I firmly b elieve that the Mossad had a hand in the assassination of JFK and that Israel must be held accountable for its actions. It's that simple. If there was evidence that Arabs had a hand in the JFK assassination, they, too, would have to be held accountable. Ho wever, the evidence does not point in the direction of the Arabs. At any rate, I do have the right under our good old - fashioned American Constitution (at least at the present) to make my views heard. If someone (wrongly) construes those views to be \"anti - I srael\" or \"anti - Semitic\" that is also their right. But being opposed to the misdeeds of Israel is not being \"anti - Semitic,\" no matter what the ADL says. However, in any event, I don't frankly care what the ADL thinks."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The evidence presented in Final Judgm ent stands on its own, no matter what the name - callers at the ADL and their assorted shills might say. Anyone who contends that I believe the JFK assassination was a \"Jewish plot\" is a liar or a fool or both — or illiterate, at the least. Despite all this, a s I've said, the frenzy over the college seminar brought an amazing amount of fully - unexpected publicity to the thesis presented in Final Judgment. Of some 27 different news accounts of the controversy that came to my attention in the days following the in itial Los Angeles Times article, fully 21 of those subsequent accounts (based on the Times' report and on coverage by the Associated Press) said specifically that the seminar featured a speaker who contended that the Mossad had a hand in the president's mu rder. Most of the references, in fact, actually appeared in the opening paragraphs of the articles in question. Not all of the accounts mentioned Final Judgment by name — although many did — but the thesis herein was definitively referenced and no doubt surpri sed those who had never heard of the theory before. Some of the headlines on the articles themselves were quite forthright: \"Speakers say Kennedy killed by Israeli plot\" read the article in the Bryan College Station Eagle out of Texas. \"Guest speaker claim s Israel masterminded the killing\" announced a sub - headline in the Miami Herald. \"Class lecturers blame JFK death on Israelis,\" reported the Chicago Sun - Times. \"Community college speakers blame JFK death on Israel,\" declared the Birmingham News. The Pasade na Star - News, in announcing that an \" uproar \" had forced the cancellation of the seminar, added (falsely) that \"One panelist said Jews behind death of JFK.\" And so it went — all across the country. In the end, what is so ironic is that if the ADL had just ign ored the seminar, the role of Israel's Mossad in the JFK assassination might never have received the widespread national exposure in the daily press that it at long last has. Ironically, Michael Granberry, the young man who covered the story for the Los An geles Times — and whose byline appeared in many of the stories across the country — left his post shortly after his story appeared. Did Granberry pay the price for telling too much about the thesis of Final Judgment to his readers? I don't know, but it's somet hing to think about. To his credit, noted commentator Nat Hentoff, who writes a widely read column on First Amendment issues, weighed in on the controversy. Hentoff wrote: \"There is no academic freedom unless one has the freedom to speak about any idea no matter how offensive or disgusting\" (the suggestion being, obviously, that my thesis is \"disgusting\" by the very nature of the fact that I have said something less than friendly toward Israel — a unique re - definition of the word \"disgusting\" indeed!). Hentof f's comments were featured in a report entitled \"Free speech in academe under fire\" published by the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. It turns out that none other than Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late president, is a member of the cen ter's advisory board."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzzle . . . So evidently Caroline has probably heard about Final Judgment — as have several members of her family and possibly her late brother, as we will see. In any case, as a direct consequence of its hysterical (and successful) effort to pre vent me from appearing at the seminar in Orange County, the ADL suffered a historic (and much - deserved) \"double - whammy\" within eight days time, stemming directly from the controversy. First of all, on October 12, 1997 the Orange County Register, the bigges t daily newspaper in one of the most densely populated metropolitan regions in the country, published a lengthy commentary in which I responded to the ADL's attacks and outlined the thesis of the book. This was the first time since Final Judgment was publi shed in January of 1994 that any \"mainstream\" newspaper gave any substantial publicity of any kind to the allegations made in the book. Although a flimsy attempt at a \"rebuttal\" by an ADL spokesman, Bruno Medwin, was published in conjunction with my commen tary, the ADL's lame response never once attempted to refute any of my specific allegations. The ADL commentary actually misled readers by suggesting that the ADL believes that \"mainstream\" theories about a possible JFK assassination conspiracy have a righ t to be heard. In fact, as noted previously, ADL national director Abe Foxman had said elsewhere that any theory of any kind relating to the assassination is potentially dangerous and has no basis in fact. Evidently, the ADL is ready to shift its position, depending upon the audience — which, of course, says a lot about the basic dishonesty of the ADL to begin with. Then, just one week later — on October 20, 1997 — the ADL suffered an even more critical blow. At a meeting of the South Orange County Community Coll ege District (SOCCCD) Board of Trustees, the board's president, Steven Frogue — who had invited me to the JFK seminar in Orange County — was re - elected by a 4 - 3 vote, much to the ADL's dismay. Although the ADL clamored for Frogue's head and sent its supporters to lobby for his resignation from the board — or his forced removal — that effort failed. Then, another board member, Marcia Milchiker — herself a member of the local ADL chapter's board of advisors — introduced a resolution for Frogue's ouster, but her scheme fe ll flat. The failed attempt to punish Frogue came following a raucous crowded public meeting in which some forty people from the general public were permitted to speak and most of them — average citizens, teachers, students and others — rose in Frogue's defens e, publicly defying the ADL even though ADL operatives were on hand taking photographs of the meeting's participants. \"This is thought control,\" said one speaker, James Scott, denouncing the ADL campaign, saying (to much applause) that \"the buck is stoppin g here tonight.\" When the ADL's Marcia Milchiker saw that there was such a genuine grassroots outcry against her effort to dislodge Frogue — as opposed to the orchestrated campaign by the ADL — Milchiker could only respond in a rambling, disjointed and rather pathetic fashion that led to other board members asking that she cut her remarks short."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Describing her \"research\" into the origins of Final Judgment and citing her so - called findings, Milchiker, at one point, referred to me as \"William Collins Piper,\" sho wing precisely how adequate her research really is. Milchiker called herself a \"scientist\" (and is thus presumably able to read) but she didn't respond when an Orange County taxpayer angrily called out, asking her \"Did you read the book?\" when Milchiker wa s attempting to explain (without any documentation whatsoever) why Final Judgment simply could not be believed. Rolling into the meeting, Milchiker had been confident that Frogue was on his way out. What a surprise she had in store. Ultimately, Milchiker c laimed the theory in Final Judgment was \"scientifically unprovable\" and \"outrageous\" and \"preposterous\" but didn't demonstrate why. Nor could she. In the end, another board member, Dorothy Fortune, speaking in Frogue's defense, publicly accused Milchiker — w ho is Jewish — of \"playing the religion card for political gain.\" So Frogue was re - elected. Yet, the ADL had another card up its sleeve. Using a retired minister, Buckner Coe, as its front man, the ADL orchestrated a recall drive against Frogue. Although the effort failed to gather the required signatures of 35,000 college district voters by March of 1998, an \"anonymous\" source came up with a $10,000 donation and the recall drive was reinvigorated At that juncture, the ADL attempted to forge a \"united front\" against Frogue, roping a variety of special interest groups, including Asian - American, Latino, Black and homosexual rights activists into backing the recall. Although that gimmick likewise failed to generate any further interest, the ADL refused to give up and called on a host of prominent Southern California politicians including two GOP members of Congress — Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Christopher Cox — to demand Frogue's ouster. Along with other Republican functionaries, the two lawmakers joined with Democrat ic Party hacks to dip into their own campaign slush accounts to help finance the ADL campaign to dislodge Frogue, generating some $40,000 at a much - ballyhooed fund - raiser. One Orange County resident, George Kadar, who formed an ad hoc committee to rally su pport for Frogue was also subjected to media attacks. In one instance, a newspaper reporter proclaimed that Kadar was, according to the ADL, also \"anti - immigrant\" only to learn to her embarrassment that Kadar was himself an immigrant who had fled the very communist \"thought police\" of Eastern Europe whose tactics were being mimicked so well — echoed in Orange County by the ADL and its allies. In the midst of the anti - Frogue petition drive, one ADL member, Harriet Walther, claimed that she was the victim of an \"anti - Semitic\" attack outside the county registrar's office. Walther claimed people in the registrar's office saw the incident but according to even the Orange County Register's report on February 4, 1998, a supervisor in the office, Mai Kang, said that, according to the Register, \"no one saw the assault.\" For my own part, at the height of the frenzy, I traveled to Orange County to speak at a public meeting of the SOCCCD board of directors in June of 1998. The event was a veritable media circus, with the p ress and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsa w Puzzle . . . armed guards very much in evidence as hundreds of people crowded into the meeting room and into an adjoining room where the overflow audience was able to watch the proceedings live via the magic of video. Waiting outside, prior to the meeting, a n idealistic young reporter for a local Jewish community newspaper made energetic efforts to pin me down as a \"Holocaust denier\" and an \"anti - Semite\" and to challenge the thesis of Final Judgment. However, Bob Ourlian, a reporter from the Los Angeles Times , was overheard whispering to the young lady, \"Don't try to argue with this guy. He's very articulate and knows what he's talking about,\" and she quickly (and wisely) changed her approach. One week prior to this, I had actually sent Ourlian a copy of Final Judgment, so he knew full well the book was thoroughly documented and that I was fully in command of the information that I had presented. As far as the Holocaust was concerned, I told the press this: I'm tired of hearing about the Holocaust. It's boring . Enough already. It happened more than 50 years ago — long before I was born. My grandmother sent four of her sons — my father and three of his brothers — off to fight in World War II. They were involved in Holocaust rescue activities as members of the U.S. mil itary. My father spent time in a veteran's hospital for his efforts on behalf of the Jews. So please: I really don't want to hear about the H o l o c a u s t . I ' m h e r e t o t a l k a b o u t t h e J F K assassination. But if you want to know about a real Holocaust, that's happ ening right now, let's take a look at what's h a p p e n i n g t o t h e A m e r i c a n I n d i a n s o n t h e concentration camps in the United States that are euphemistically called \"reservations. \" My great - great - grandfather was a full - blooded American Indian and for all I know , I have relatives on the reservations today, suffering malnutrition, alcoholism, high rates of suicide and other tragedies. Despite all this, the federal government is cutting aid to the reservations, yet billions of American tax dollars are going to Isra el. If you want to talk about that Holocaust, I'll be more than glad to. Needless to say, the reporters didn't seem interested in discussing that subject, and frankly, I'm not surprised. It was quite a drama. The corpulent Professor Roy Bauer also put in an appearance accompanied by a coterie of giggling and notably unattractive women who cooed at his witticisms as he circulated a malicious four - page \"report\" entitled \"Just Who Is Michael Collins Piper?\" which purported to detail my crimes against the Jewi sh people. But what was interesting was that Bauer had backed off in his charge that I was a \"Holocaust denier,\" now contending that I was only \"reportedly\" a Holocaust \"revisionist.\""},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Missing, however, was Marcia Milchiker, my foremost critic on the SOCCC D board. Although for an entire year she had much to say about me and about my publisher, including making the patently ridiculous accusation that we were attempting to \"bring back the Nazi Party,\" she refused (in ADL fashion) to face me when I came to con front her. Although I had been the center of bitter public argument at SOCCCD meetings for almost a year, the board, unfortunately, would not permit me any more than three minutes to speak (the same amount allotted to other speakers). However, the entire t ime I was speaking, Irv Rubin, the head of the violent Jewish Defense League (JDL), and two equally - repugnant associates were shouting from the audience, resulting in the police finally expelling one of Rubin's cronies, a bizarre troll named Barry Krugel. At one point, in exasperation, I told the board, quite frankly, \"There's been a lot of talk here about 'anti - Semitism,' but if ever there was an argument in favor of anti - Semitism, it's this self - appointed spokesman for the Jewish community right here,\" re ferring to Rubin. There was a positive side to this most raucous event, however. The day afterward, I was invited by Saddleback College journalism professor Lee Williams to address his class on the college campus. Williams issued the invitation on behalf o f the staff of the college newspaper and I met with the staff in the newspaper office on the campus where the students posed thought - provoking questions and exhibited the very type of intellectual curiosity that the ADL was so determined to suppress. Not o nly did the students defy the book banners at the ADL by asking me to pose for a picture with them, but later they went even further and, as a group, publicly defied the ADL by coming to the defense of Steve Frogue. But the ADL - instigated clamor for the de struction of Frogue still continued. The ADL even managed to contrive a short - lived alliance between Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Orange County and her bitter foe, former Rep. Bob Dornan, the Republican whom Mrs. Sanchez narrowly defeated in 1996 and then dispatched into oblivion in the 1998 election. Both Mrs. Sanchez and Dornan endorsed the recall campaign at the ADL's behest. However, Mrs. Sanchez back trailed after many of her Hispanic supporters (who despised Dornan) recoiled at her \"deal with th e devil.\" Despite all this firepo wer, the ADL's recall scheme crashed and burned. In the end, on November 12, 1998 the ADL hate - mongers suffered an embarrassing defeat. The ADL's media - backed 16 - month - long campaign to oust Frogue came to a crashing halt. T he Orange County registrar of voters ruled that a two - dozen member team of petition circulators had fallen short, having submitted some 13,000 invalid signatures. The media's coverage of the ADL's Waterloo was interesting. The Orange County Register's Kimb erly Kindy, who had reported the ADL's campaign against Frogue with particular relish, failed to mention the ADL's role in the scuttled recall in her notably brief report on the demise of the recall drive. Instead, Miss Kindy focused on the role of Democra tic and Republican politicians in the effort, never once indicating the ADL had been the prime mover behind the bungled effort to eviscerate Frogue."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Foreword: The Other Side of the Jigsaw Puzzle . . . There was an interesting footnote to this. My old nemesis, Professor Roy Bauer was ordered to seek psychi atric counseling because of the inflammatory writings in his scurrilous campus newsletter in which I had been one of his targets. Bauer sued the SOCCCD board, charging that his First Amendment rights were violated. Bauer's concern for free speech meant lit tle when he was working to suppress my liberties, but when the tables were turned, he took a second look at the Bill of Rights. Bauer won his suit and I'm glad he did, because, unlike Bauer, I do believe in the First Amendment, even though he and the ADL d o not. Steve Frogue declined to seek reelection to the SOCCCD board in the year 2000, but we can be certain the \"Final Judgment Affair\" would have come back to haunt him. However, the fact is the ADL suffered a walloping defeat in Orange County and it happ ened again in Schaumburg, Illinois, as we will see later. The ADL will continue to be defeated over this issue as long as I have anything to say about it — and the ADL knows it. For his own part, the loathsome Irv Rubin of the JDL is now dead — allegedly havin g committed suicide while in federal custody after having been arrested in late 2001 on charges of plotting to bomb the office of California GOP Congressman Darrel Issa, an Arab - American. Yet, Rubin was precisely the type of speaker that the ADL and its al lies welcomed at the SOCCCD — saying much about what the ADL's agenda really is. What is it about Final Judgment that so upsets the ADL? Why indeed does the ADL \"protest too much\"? Here's your opportunity to find out. Then, perhaps, you'll understand why Fin al Judgment really is on the mark. Had I not amended Final Judgment after its first edition, I would say — even now — that the book could continue to stand on its merits with no further emendation whatsoever. Now that the book has been substantially expanded, more so than I would have thought possible, I do believe the book will stand the test of time. The facts speak for themselves. Israel's Mossad was indeed a primary player alongside the CIA and the Lansky Crime Syndicate in the assassination of John F. Kenn edy. Ultimately, Final Judgment will prove to be the first - ever comprehensive record of that conspiracy. I believe I have taken a new look at a very big jigsaw puzzle that displays a remarkably complex and somewhat murky picture. On the puzzle you see befo re you all of the various groups and individuals implicated in the JFK assassination conspiracy. It is an immensely confusing picture. However, when you turn the puzzle over you find one complete picture — and that's a great big very clear picture of the Isr aeli flag. All the other flags on the front of the puzzle are, in intelligence jargon, \"false flags,\" and Final Judgment proves just that.

Kennedy? All of the information which, taken together, proves this contention has long been in the public domain. This book, Final Judgment, brings all of these facts together for the first time in a fascinating and frightening scenario that — although controversial — does make sense. Considering all of the theories about the assassination of John F. Kennedy that have been circulating for years, how could anyone ever suggest that Israel's Mossad was involved ? This was the reaction of more than a few people when apprised of the thesis presented in the pages of this book. Yet, I believe, tha t when you read this volume you will reach the same conclusion: that Israel and its spy agency, the Mossad, did indeed play a critical role in the JFK assassination conspiracy and its cover - up. The evidence is there, as you shall see. It was in 1989, while re - reading A. J. Weberman and Michael Canfield's Coup d'Etat in America (first published in 1975) that I first stumbled upon a strange reference that ultimately led to my research that is outlined here in the pages of Final Judgment. The reference, simple as it was, appearing on page 41, read as follows: \"After the assassination, an informer for the Secret Service and the FBI who had infiltrated a Cuban exile group and was in the process of selling them machine guns, reported that on November 21, 1963 he w as told, 'We now have plenty of money — our new backers are the Jews — as soon as they take care of JFK.' This man had furnished reliable information in the past.\" (emphasis added) I barely noticed the reference, but it did intrigue me. Who did this source mea n by \"the Jews\" and why (of all people) would \"they\" want to \"take care of JFK\"? I concluded the source meant Jewish gangsters such as Meyer Lansky who wanted to regain their Cuban gambling interests they lost when Castro came to power. This, I thought, ha d to be the answer. Frankly, I laid the speculation aside. It was just one lone detail among millions of words written about the JFK assassination. Nearly a year went by before I came across the reference again — while re - reading the same book. I pondered th e quote for a moment, thinking, \"This is interesting.\" However, I once again cast it aside. I had long ago already concluded that the CIA, in collusion with elements of \"the Mafia\" and the anti - Castro Cuban exiles, was responsible for the president's assas sination. However, an entire year later — sometime in 1991 — I came across a variation of the same quotation cited in the book by Weberman and Canfield. This time it appeared in David Scheim's book, Contract on America, which contends \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" an d which also"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"[ii] Final Judgment vehemently dismisses any CIA involvement whatsoever. I had read Scheim's book when it first came out in 1988, but I had not noticed the reference (or the similarity to the other one) at that time. What intrigued me, however, was that Scheim' s rendition of the quote deleted the reference to the alleged Jewish backers of the Cuban plotters. My immediate thought was: \"What's Scheim trying to hide?\" At that moment I finally began to see that this unusual (seemingly minor) detail might, in fact, p oint toward something much bigger than I had realized. THE LANSKY CONNECTION It was at this time that a new biography of organized crime figure Meyer Lansky was released. Entitled Little Man: Meyer Lansky and the Gangster Life, the book — prepared in coope ration with Lansky's family — was little more than a puff piece for Lansky. I realized immediately that the book still somehow seemed to be missing quite a lot. It was then that I returned to my library and pulled a book off the shelf that I hadn't re - read i n perhaps fifteen years. It was Hank Messick's biography of Lansky. Re - reading this important book I began to see that Meyer Lansky was not just a Mafia advisor as David Scheim, for example, would have his readers believe. Instead, Lansky was \"the chairman of the board\" of organized crime. All of the Mafia figures that had been repeatedly implicated in the JFK assassination were, in fact, Lansky's front men — his subordinates, his underlings. In short, if \"the Mafia\" had a hand in the killing of JFK, then Lan sky had to have been one of the key players. Yet, as I quickly began to see in reviewing many of the works which allege that \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" Lansky's preeminent role was being ignored or otherwise under - played. I was aware of Lansky's close ties to Israel. After all, Lansky fled to Israel when the heat was on in the United States. But how deeply did the Lansky - Israeli connection go? My research into that question began to turn up some interesting facts. THE ISRAELI CONNECTION At this juncture, how ever, I had no reason whatsoever to think that Israel would have had any reason to participate in the JFK assassination conspiracy. However, it was just about the time that I had begun to take a second look at the Lansky connection — in 1991 — that several new works were released which provided never - before revealed information about the covert relationship between the United States and Israel. These books, cited extensively in Final Judgment, made it all too clear that John F. Kennedy had become embroiled in a bitter behind - the - scenes battle with Israel. In fact, Kennedy was at war. JFK's secret war with Israel was something that even long - time JFK assassination researchers had no reason to know about. Much of the material had long been classified. It was a sec ret — a deep, dark secret."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Preface [iii] Some of JFK's communications with then - Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion were classified for years, until just recently. Not even top - level intelligence officials with special security clearance were initially allowed access to those explosive documents. In fact, prior to these more recent revelations, very little about JFK's relations with Israel and the Arab world had ever actually been published anywhere. As historian David Schoenbaum pointed out quite notably in his book, The United States and the State of Israel: \"Submerged among the high - visibility themes of East - West relations, the nuclear arms race and the early dawn of a test ban and nonproliferation, the Berlin and Cuban missile crisis, the perplexities of the newly decolonized Belgian Congo, buoyant hopes for an Alliance for Progress in Latin America, and the deepening quagmire in Vietnam, the Middle East is scarcely even visible in the standard biographies that followed Kennedy's assassination. Even by liberal estim ates, Ben - Gurion and Nasser, Israel and Egypt appear on only seven each of Theodore Sorensen's 758, and Arthur M. Schlesinger's 1,031 pages of text.\" (Emphasis added.) In short, while JFK assassination researchers were busy probing a wide variety of areas, they were missing the big picture — the secret picture on the other side of the jigsaw puzzle. So it was that the new revelations about Kennedy's relationship with Israel (and its potential link to the assassination conspiracy) made me realize that there wa s an unexplored area of research — never before considered — that needed examination. ISRAEL, LANSKY & THE CIA By this time, then, the long and close relationship between Israel and JFK's foes at the CIA was something that was now being acknowledged. And JFK 's own war with the CIA was already common knowledge. At the time of the JFK assassination, however, the depth and breadth of the CIA's relationship with Israel's Mossad, however, was not so commonly known. The pieces of the puzzle were all there. They sim ply needed to be put together. With a basic thesis now evolving in my mind, I began re - reading much of the published information about the JFK assassination, his policy toward Israel and the history of organized crime. And in so doing, I repeatedly found m yself stumbling upon new information that continued to verify what was initially in my mind just a theory, but which I now believe to be the truth. By December of 1992 I realized that I had enough material for a book and I began to write it. But even as I was already in the process of writing the book, I was startled by the vast amount of material that I was continually uncovering — and virtually all of it was in the pages of mainstream sources freely available to anyone who cared to do the research. I thus b egan to realize that I had indeed begun to assemble a remarkable wealth of material that brought my initial thesis full circle."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"[i v] Final Judgment THE PERMINDEX CONNECTION It is the Permindex connection which is the tie that binds — the final proof that the Mossad was at th e center of the assassination conspiracy. In Permindex we find all of the critical elements tying the Mossad, the CIA and the Lansky Crime Syndicate together in close - knit intrigue linked directly to the murder of President Kennedy. Although researchers ha ve devoted much time and energy to pursuing a wide variety of questions relating to the JFK assassination (focusing on many matters that will never be resolved) most have steered clear of Permindex. Those who have referenced it portray Permindex as some so rt of remnant of the Third Reich but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, understanding the forces behind Permindex is the key to resolving the biggest mystery of this century: the question of not only who killed John F. Kennedy — but why. INSI DERS AGREE . . . Just before I began the book I mentioned my theory to a rather well - known former United States congressman. He surprised me when he said, \"I think you are on to something. I've believed for years that the Mossad was involved in the K ennedy assassination, but I never really took the time to look into it. I'm glad you're doing it, though. It will be an important book. It's a book I would have liked to have written myself.\" Then, just after I finished the first draft, I sent a copy of th e manuscript to another former member of Congress, Paul Findley, thinking that he might have some interest in the subject. His response was perhaps a bit astonishing. The ex - Congressman wrote me a surprising letter in which he said, \"I will mention that ov er the past four years I have had lengthy correspondence with a retired diplomat from a western European nation whose family (including himself) has had disastrous experiences with Israel and the Mossad. He has been prodding me all that time to do what you have done.\" — that is, write a book exploring Israel's secret role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Congressman Findley then passed the manuscript on to the Frenchman (whose remarkable story you will learn about in these pages) who in turn provided me a dditional fascinating leads and inside information that helped make the thesis presented in Final Judgment complete. ONE COMPLETE PICTURE Israel's Mossad was indeed a primary force behind the JFK assassination conspiracy. The Israeli connection pulls all of the pieces of the puzzle together into one complete picture. The role of the Mossad in the JFK assassination is indeed the \"missing link\" in the conspiracy. For the sake of history, it is a story that needs to be told. — MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"A Who's Who of the JFK Assassination Conspiracy and Cover - Up While the following selection of names in this special \"who's who\" is by no means complete, it does provide the reader of Final Judgmen t with a brief overview of the facts relating to the involvement of the individuals in question with the circumstances surrounding not only the JFK assassination itself, but also the efforts by some to uncover the truth about the assassination — and by other s to bury it. Following each name and description are references to the particular chapters in Final Judgment where details about that individual appear in pertinent part. The inclusion of any name in particular is by no means intended to suggest that the individual — unless specifically stated — had foreknowledge that the murder of President Kennedy was being planned. As we note in these pages, there were many people who were brought into the JFK assassination conspiracy and the subsequent cover - up who had no idea of the actual role that they were playing. The following \"who's who\" — if read in this context — provides the reader a quick glance at the key individuals who ultimately prove central to a complete understanding of the entirety of the conspiracy that resu lted in the assassination of President Kennedy. At Permindex Clay Shaw - If New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison had been permitted to carry out an unimpeded investigation and prosecution of Shaw, a CIA contract operative and former director of the International Trade Mart in New Orleans implicated in involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie, Guy Banister and other figures central to the JFK assassination conspiracy, the truth about Shaw's connections — through a shadowy corporation known as P ermindex — to not only Israel's Mossad, but also the international crime syndicate of Israeli loyalist Meyer Lansky would have been bared to the world. (See Chapter 15) Louis M. Bloomfield - Based in Montreal, Bloomfield was a long - time intelligence operati ve and a front man for the powerful Bronfman family interests. The Bronfmans were not only key international backers of Israel but also long - time figures in the Lansky crime syndicate. Bloomfield, one of the foremost figures in the Israeli lobby in Canada and one of Israel's leading international operatives, not only served as the chief shareholder in the Permindex Corporation on whose board of directors Clay Shaw served, but also had intimate ties to American intelligence.

His Swiss bank, the Banque De Credit International, also served as the chief European money laundry for Meyer Lansky, chief of the global crime syndicate. (See Chapter 8, Chapter 15, Appendix Four and Appendix Nine). John King - A close busine ss associate of Tibor Rosenbaum's protégé and sometime front man, Bernard Cornfeld, King showed up in New Orleans in the early stages of Jim Garrison's investigation — before Clay Shaw's name had come up — and sought to persuade Garrison (through a bribery att empt) to give up the inquiry. Fortunately he failed in his scheme.

Catchpole cites groups often alleged to have been involved in some way with the JFK assassination — although this summary by no means is complete (ignoring, in particular, t he CIA as an institution):   Cuban Communists   Cuban Anti - Communists   Military - Industrial Complex   A Renegade CIA Clique   Organized Crime   Soviet Communists   The FBI   The Mastermind This final theory, according to Catchpole, is that \"the Mafia had actually taken ov er the Howard Hughes organization from the bedridden recluse, and it was run by a \"Mr. X,\" possibly [organized crime syndicate boss] .

Each and every one of these theories, additionally, has been intertwined with"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"[2] Final Judgment 63 one or more of the others. And now, the advent of Stone's film, coupled w i t h t h e s u b s e q u e n t r e l e a s e o f s e v e r a l n e w b o o k s o n t h e assassination — most notably Mark Lane's Plausible Denial, which proved CIA com plicity in the president's murder — has brought new interest in the controversy. Perhaps some day there will even be a book which places the blame for the assassination on, as New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison used to say, \"retired circus clowns.\" H owever, it was not retired circus clowns who killed John F. Kennedy, at least so far as we know. ISRAEL'S CENTRAL ROLE This book contends that Israel's Mossad was a primary player alongside the CIA and the Lansky Crime Syndicate in the JFK assassination conspiracy and that, in fact, the Mossad's role was probably the driving force behind the conspiracy. It is clearly Israel and its Mossad — as we shall document — which is the one force which ties all of the most frequently mentioned alleged conspirators toget her: the CIA, the anti - Castro Cuban forces, organized crime and, most specifically — and more significantly than the so - called Mafia — the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate. The connections are far more sinister and go far deeper than most might imagine. In Final J udgment we will examine all of this in detail. ISRAEL'S MOTIVE Israel, as we shall see, had a very distinct motive not only to orchestrate Kennedy's removal from office but also to elevate his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson into the White House. As did, of course, many of those other elements in the conspiracy that resulted in Kennedy's murder. Never once, however — at least in standard assassination research — has the suggestion that Israel had a hand in Kennedy's murder ever been uttered. Yet, the evidence is there — evidence that has lain dormant or has otherwise been ignored or gone unrecognized for its significance. Indeed, virtually all of the facts brought together in Final Judgment have been drawn from recognized volumes in the field of JFK assassination r esearch and in other standard sources. One former member of Congress, Rep. Paul Findley (R - Ill.) himself has publicly suggested that Israel indeed may have had a hand in the JFK assassination. In the March 1992 issue of The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Findley points out: \"It is interesting — but not surprising — to note that in all the words written and uttered about the Kennedy assassination, Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad, has never been mentioned. And yet a Mossad motive is obvious.\" 3 Findley lays out the motive — a motive that we outline in detail in the pages of this book: \"Israeli leaders never trusted the Kennedys. They were"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"6 4 The Tie That Binds [3] aware that when President Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy, was ambassador to Great Britain, he frequently p raised Nazi Germany. \"During John Kennedy's campaign for the presidency, a group of New York Jews had privately offered to meet his campaign expenses if he would let them set his Middle East policy. He did not agree . . . As president, he provided only lim ited support to Israel. \"On the other hand, Lyndon Johnson had demonstrated his strong support for Israel throughout his political career. The government of Israel, therefore, had every reason to believe that its interests would be better advanced with Joh nson as president. And indeed they were. After Kennedy's death, the United States, for the first time, began large - scale shipments of arms to Israel .. . \"Certainly, the Mossad possessed the resources to carry out an assassination almost any place on earth .\" Findley concludes: \"Am I accusing the Mossad of complicity? Absolutely not. I have no evidence of such. My point is simply this: on this question, as on almost all others, American reporters and commentators cannot bring themselves to cast Israel in an unfavorable light — despite the obvious fact that Mossad complicity is as plausible as any of the other theories.\" 4 In these pages we will provide Congressman Findley and the readers with the evidence. We will let the readers make the final judgment. `SOME SUBTERRANEAN ASSOCIATION' One leading assassination investigator, Carl Oglesby, recently summarized his own decades of personal research. \"It was an inside job,\" he said, \"something on the order of the enterprise which we discovered in the Iran/Contra sc andal. \"At the same time,\" he added as a caveat, \"I cannot bring myself to believe that an institution such as the CIA [for example] could in any formal and regular sense decide to kill the president. \"So what I am talking about is an off - the - shelf, off - th e - books kind of action that must have been put together by some subterranean association cutting through not only the CIA, but to a certain extent the FBI the Dallas police and the military - intelligence agencies themselves.\" 5 F i n a l J u d g m e n t s u g g e s t s t h a t i t w a s I s r a e l ' s M o s s a d t h a t was indeed the very \"subterranean association\" that did cut thro ug h t he va rio us ent ities which found t he ms elves bro ug ht into the JFK assassination conspiracy. In a recent interview another respected JFK assassination researcher, Peter Dale Scott, perhaps lends further credence to the theory we are about to present. Scott believes that there were a variety of forces at work behind the JFK assassination. He specifically fingers \"Lyndon Johnson's backers — particularly those who had a stake in the military - industrial complex\" and \"an intelligence - Mafia connection that included members of the intelligence community who were involved with military - industrial"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"[4] Final Judgment 65 corporate backers of Lyndon Johnson, who in turn were involved with Mafia peopl e. At a minimum,\" according to Scott, \"you have to consider this triad of forces.\" Note Scott's words: \"at a minimum.\" 6 This, of course, suggests that other forces were indeed involved. Final Judgment not only suggests that it was, in fact, Israel's Mossa d, but also clearly pinpoints the Mossad connection. `OTHER INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS' Scott himself goes one step further, but without naming the Mossad. He says, \"In my research, the most suggestive clues have emerged from a relatively restricted circle wi thin what I call the dark quadrant of suppressed relationships or deep politics: a circle within the tripartite world of first, CIA, defense, and other intelligence networks; second, the underworld of organized crime and anti - Castro Cubans; and third, corp orate interests with links both to the intelligence and defense communities and also to organized crime. \"The key,\" says Scott, \"is that all those in this dark quadrant would have resisted its exposure whether or not they were key plotters.\" 7 Final Judgme nt concurs with Scott's judgment. Again, note Scott's words: \"CIA, defense, and other intelligence networks.\" As we demonstrate — and which is not really so very secret — it is Israel's Mossad — above and beyond any other intelligence network — foreign or domestic — that has been unusually close (almost incestuously so) to the CIA in a variety of international ventures. THE MEDIA'S ROLE What's more, we go one step beyond Scott's conclusions. Final Judgment points out the highly significant role of the American medi a in its role in the cover - up. The cover - up of the JFK assassination conspiracy could never have succeeded without the support of a willing media. The fact is that Israel and its supporters in the American media have a long and intimate relationship. Until recent years — and even still today — criticism of Israel and its misdeeds have been verboten in the Establishment media, as noted previously in the comments by Congressman Findley. 'FALSE FLAGS' We will illustrate, by several notable examples, how primary friends of Israel in the American media have been key players in floating \"false leads\" (or \"false flags\" in intelligence jargon) that have directed attention and suspicion elsewhere. This is a phenomenon never before examined in studying the JFK assassina tion and which explains, in large part, why the real truth about the assassination conspiracy has remained hidden for so long, all of the research notwithstanding."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 The Tie That Binds [5] (In Chapter 3 we will examine numerous instances wherein Israel's Mossad itself utilized \"f alse flags\" to cover up its own role in a wide variety of assassination conspiracies and crimes around the globe.) A CHANGE IN MIDDLE EAST POLICY Professor Scott, like many JFK researchers, has long focused on the change of policy toward Vietnam that too k place as a result of John F. Kennedy's assassination. He also points out that there was, additionally, a change of policy toward Latin America. However, in these pages, we demonstrate beyond question that the most profound — and, in retrospect, probably mo st lasting and unusual — reversal in the conduct of American foreign policy was in the arena of U.S. - Israeli relations. These facts, unfortunately, have been neglected by even the most serious researchers into the JFK assassination. THE THEORIES MESH The p urpose of Final Judgment, you see, is not to prove, once and for all, that there was indeed a conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy and to perpetuate a cover - up of that conspiracy. That has been proven, time and again, in an endless array of books, monographs, magazine articles — even in the pages of several novels. Instead, Final Judgment takes the commonly accepted theories one step further and binds them all together — all too well — in a frightening scenario that is surely so very close to the t ruth. Many desired JFK's removal from the presidency. However, as we note throughout these pages, research over the years has — for a variety of reasons — ignored the bitter conflict between the State of Israel and John F. Kennedy. Likewise, researchers have — a gain, for a variety of reasons, innocent and otherwise — ignored the very close connections between Israel and each of the diverse groups all of whom had a reason to want to end John F. Kennedy's presidency: the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate, the Ma fia, the anti - Castro Cubans, and the CIA. In Final Judgment, we present a theory that, in the free market of ideas, deserves consideration — controversial though it will be. John F. Kennedy himself put it best: \"A nation that is afraid to let its people judg e the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\" What all of the commonly alleged conspiracies are tied together by is the one strand that has been consistently ignored — and that, of course, is the Israeli connection. I n Final Judgment we will consider this (unfortunately) long - ignored hidden aspect of history. What Final Judgment proves is not only that Israel had reason to conspire against JFK, but that Israel was in a central position to not only"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"[6] Final Judgment 67 coordinate the assas sination scheme (and did) but also the subsequent cover - up — all of this in close collaboration with its co - conspirators in the CIA and organized crime — most specifically those elements intimately linked to syndicate boss Meyer Lansky. Israel — as much as the Mafia or the CIA, for example — stood to benefit greatly from the death of America's 35th president — and did, JFK's assassination set the stage for Israel to become a major power. Research into the Kennedy assassination is most difficult, if only because the literature is so immense, the web so tangled, and the surfeit of theories and potential conspirators so seemingly unending. What's more, some assassination researchers have latched onto their own unique theories and, as a consequence, have failed to look e lsewhere — in the direction of Israel, for example. With all of this in mind, let us proceed on the basis that there are certain areas of agreement. GENERALLY ACCEPTED CONCLUSIONS Our final judgment — outlined in these pages — rests on a foundation composed of the following generally accepted conclusions about the nature of the JFK assassination conspiracy:   That there was a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy;   That the conspiracy itself involved elements of the U.S. intelligence community, the CIA in particular;   That Organized Crime figures played a major part in the conspiracy;   That anti - Castro Cubans were actively participating in the conspiracy, at the urging of and/or manipulation by the CIA and elements of Organized Crime;   That somehow Lee Harvey Oswald (wit tingly or unwittingly) was brought into the conspiracy and that the conspirators planted false evidence to link Oswald with Fidel Castro and the Soviets;   That Oswald was involved in some manner of U.S. intelligence activity, even if he was unaware those ac tivities were sponsored or manipulated by some element of the U.S. intelligence community.   That Jack Ruby was either an active participant in the assassination conspiracy itself or was used in some fashion to manipulate Oswald prior to the assassination of JFK;   That Ruby was actively involved in organized crime activities and that he was, as a consequence of that involvement, also linked with organized crime activities that operated in conjunction (or ran parallel) with U.S. intelligence community activitie s.   That the Central Intelligence Agency was cognizant of the activities of both Oswald and Ruby and certainly manipulated both;   That Oswald was executed by Jack Ruby for the purpose of silencing Oswald forever;   That a major cover - up of the JFK assassinatio n conspiracy was undertaken following the events in Dallas;"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 The Tie That Binds [7]   That the cover - up involved elements of the federal government (including the CIA);   T hat the Warren Co mmission and the Ho use Assassinations Committee were deliberate participants in the cover - up;   That the cover - up conspiracy was conducted for a wide variety of motivations — both ostensibly \"patriotic\" and otherwise — including — but not limited to: a) burying intelligence community connections to the assassination conspiracy; b) protecting Organized Crime elem ents involved; c) preventing hostilities between the United States and foreign nations (whether it be the Soviet Union or Castro's Cuba); and d) resolving questions about the assassination in the public's mind, both here and abroad.   That the Controlled Media act ively encouraged and/or participated in the cover - up due to its links to the CIA, the intelligence community in general, and Organized Crime. This is the basis upon which the research for this volume was undertaken. Upon this foundation Final Judgment tie s together all of the facts and shows how the State of Israel and its spy agency, the Mossad, collaborated with not only the CIA but also key elements in Organized Crime and in the anti - Castro Cuban community in order to orchestrate the assassination of Jo hn F. Kennedy and the cover - up. THE EVIDENCE IS THERE Some of the facts presented — while not necessarily \"new\" — have been available to researchers for decades. However, many researchers, regrettably, have not been looking in the right direction. That , of course, is not their fault. Additional information — particularly in regard to Kennedy's difficult relations with Israel and how U.S. - Israeli relations changed drastically as a result of JFK's murder — has really only recently come into the public forum. In Final Judgment we will explore this information in detail. It is this information — long unavailable to even the most dedicated researchers — that ties all of the previous data together. The remarkable scenario presented in Final Judgment logically incorpor ates all of the commonly - accepted theories into one broadly encompassing theory that not only makes sense but which brings the diverse elements in the conspiracy together full circle. It is for this reason that Final Judgment truly lives up to its name. Th e theory presented in the pages of Final Judgment has been greeted with the charge of \"anti - Semitism\" — a standard attack directed upon any utterance even vaguely critical of Israel and its misdeeds. However, the author leaves it up to the basic honesty and open - mindedness of the readers to determine whether or not the theory presented in this volume makes sense."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"[8] Final Judgment 69 W H A T H A P P E N E D . . . Here, in essence, is the basis of the theory presented and documented — sometimes in excruciating detail — in the pages which follow.  That during his presidency, John F. Kennedy alienated three major international power blocs: the American CIA, Organized Crime, and Israel and its American lobby.   That in each case, Kennedy's continued tenure in the White House was perceived by each of these power groups as a threat to its very existence.   T hat each of these major international po wer b locs was closely intertwined with the others, often on several levels.   T hat when Kenned y's presence in the W hite House became so intolerable t hat these forces came together in a wide - ranging conspiracy that resulted in JFK's murder.   That the power of these forces, together, over the American media played a vital role in the assassination conspiracy cover - up. Final Judgment explores in detail the little - known behind - the - scenes war between John F. Kennedy and Israel and documents how U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arab world underwent a drastic reversal upon JFK's assassination. This book also documents not only the intimate collaboration bet ween the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate and the Mossad, but also the similar incestuous relationship between the Lansky syndicate and Israel's allies in the CIA. We will also focus on the singularly important role of Meyer Lansky's positioning in the joint M ossad - CIA - Organized Crime nexus that came together in the JFK assassination. Lansky's own role in the JFK assassination conspiracy has been continually ignored or otherwise suppressed — even by those very \"authorities\" who claim that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" As we shall see, Meyer Lansky was, in fact, the real \"overlord\" of the international crime syndicate; many of the \"Mafia bosses\" who allegedly masterminded the JFK assassination were, indeed, Lansky henchmen, front - men, underlings. The basic facts have vir tually all been published in previous works on the JFK assassination and in other studies on the subjects of U.S - Israeli relations, international intelligence intrigue, and organized crime. It is only now, however, that all of the facts have been finally p laced together in a neatly - constructed jigsaw puzzle that presents the whole picture in its rather simple entirety. It is not, as we shall see, as complex as it might at first appear. However, the bottom line is this: it is clear that not only did Israel h ave a motive for participating in the JFK assassination, but that it indeed did play a critical part in the conspiracy. A THEORY OF POWER POLITICS AT WORK The conspiracy outlined here was a criminal enterprise involving power politics in its highest — and lowest — forms.

Kennedy.   Chapter 3 reviews the Mossad's histor ic use of so - called \"false flags\" in its worldwide acts of terrorism and assassination, leaving others (such as the Mafia,\" \"right wing extremists,\" and \"Arab terrorists\") to take the blame. The point driven home is that the Mossad could have done likewise in the JFK assassination. JFK, LBJ AND ISRAEL   Chapter 4 examines the initial tactical alliance — and then enmity — between John F. Kennedy and his father Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy not only with the Israeli lobby but also the Israeli - linked Meyer Lansky O rganized Crime Syndicate.   Chapter 5 reviews, in depth, the growing conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the state of Israel — facts which have never been seriously examined by students of the JFK assassination.   Chapter 6 outlines how the assassinat ion of John F. Kennedy permitted the Lansky Crime Syndicate - and Israeli lobby - linked Lyndon B. Johnson (a favorite of Israel's allies in the CIA) to assume the presidency and begin an incredible reversal of JFK's Middle East policies, thereby strengthenin g Israel's global hand. This important chapter also demonstrates how Israel, the CIA and the Lansky Syndicate stood to benefit from American involvement in the Vietnam War — a little explored aspect of that unfortunate period. MEYER LANSKY, ISRAEL AND THE C IA   Chapter 7 is a comprehensive overview of organized crime figure Meyer Lansky, covering his preeminent role in global criminal enterprises and his links not only to Israel's Mossad, but also American intelligence.   Chapter 8 explores the close relationsh ip between Israel's Mossad and the American CIA, and particularly the important role of the Mossad's chief CIA ally, James Angleton, the CIA's chief of counterintelligence.   Chapter 9 reviews the conflicts between the administration of John F. Kennedy and t he CIA, Israel's primary link in the world of international"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 The Tie That Binds [11] intelligence. Also considered are the connections of a number of key CIA figures (linked to the JFK assassination) with Israel.   Chapter 10 sheds important light upon Meyer Lansky's ties with New Orleans Mafia chieftain Carlos Marcello (often fingered as a key conspirator in the JFK assassination) and upon Lansky's preeminence over the Italian Mafia in organized crime activities.   Chapter 11 reviews Lansky's involvement with Mafia figures Johnny Ros selli and Santo Trafficante Jr., and Sam Giancana and explores all - new revelations about the ties between the Chicago \"Mafia\" and Israel's intelligence service.   Chapter 12 is a detailed exploration of Meyer Lansky's predominant role in the international dr ug racket and how his criminal syndicate worked hand - in - glove with the CIA in these international ventures.   Chapter 13 considers a little known angle in the JFK assassination conspiracy: the role of Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen. This chapter documents Cohen's close relationship with Israeli intelligence and connects the murder of actress Marilyn Monroe, with Cohen's pro - Israel activities.   Chapter 14 is a review of the career of Jack Ruby as an errand boy for both the CIA and the Meyer Lansky O rganized Crime Syndicate and his activities connected with the JFK assassination. And yes, there's even evidence linking Ruby to Israel. PERMINDEX AND THE FRENCH CONNECTION   Chapter 15, aptly entitled, \"The Twain Shall Meet,\" demonstrates that it was thro ugh the little - explored Rome - based intelligence operation known as Permindex that the Israeli Mossad - CIA alliance and the Lansky Crime Syndicate came together and utilized their joint resources to orchestrate the JFK assassination, bringing about the consp iracy documented in previous chapters full circle.   Chapter 16 documents a little - known libel trial in which a jury concluded that the CIA had a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and examines the role that James Jesus Angleton, Israel's ally at t he CIA played in the conspiracy. Most importantly, we will examine the oft - mentioned (but little - understood) so - called \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination conspiracy which was, in fact, also the Israeli connection.   Chapter 17 dissects the role tha t CIA and Mossad assets in the media played in distorting the public's perception of the JFK assassination conspiracy and how they pointed the finger of blame elsewhere.   Chapter 18 is a new look at the assassination of Senator Robert F. and how RFK's murde r ties together not only the CIA, Israel's Mossad, and the Meyer Lansky syndicate, but also the Iranian secret police, SAVAK (itself a creation of the CIA and the Mossad).   The concluding chapter constitutes an overview outlining the nature of the conspirac y that resulted in the JFK assassination."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"[12] Final Judgment 73 Then, what follows are ten uniquely diverse appendices that shed new light on a wide variety of little - known aspects of the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up that have been distorted or misinterpreted or o therwise forgotten. SOME LITTLE - KNOWN SIDELIGHTS . . .   Appendix One considers the covert CIA career of George Herbert Walker Bush and examines his integral links with several of the key players in the JFK assassination conspiracy, examining that critical question, \"Where Was George?\"   Appendix Two reviews Lee Harvey Oswald's little - known link to at least one long - time federal undercover informant who operated in both \"right - \" and \"left - \" wing groups.   Appendix Three puts to rest, at long last, the theory t hat \"right wing extremists\" were the driving force behind the JFK assassination. The primary \"right wing\" figure linked to the assassination was moving in pro - Israel circles all along. (This appendix will surely open up new vistas for argument and discussi on among \"liberal\" JFK assassination researchers.)   Appendix Four discusses a hotly controversial subject that no other book on the JFK assassination has ever discussed before: the ethnic and political antecedents of the staff attorneys who handled the day - to - day work of the Warren Commission \"investigation\" of the JFK assassination. This appendix also examines the little - known facts about the \"kingmaker\" behind Warren Commission member Gerald R. Ford: a political power broker with ties to both Israel's Moss ad and the Lansky Crime Syndicate.   Appendix Five looks into the widely - discussed claim that \"The Federal Reserve Killed JFK.\" Separating the facts from the myths, this appendix shows that there's much more to the story than meets the eye.   Appendix Six take s a look at the strange death of not only former CIA Director William Colby (himself a critic of Israel) but another high - level CIA figure who ran afoul of Israel's Mossad. (Even in both of these cases there may indeed be a JFK assassination connection.) YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST . . .   Appendix Seven is the first - ever exposition of the real link between the JFK assassination and Watergate. Forget anything you've ever heard before about the \"Dallas - Watergate\" connection. What you'll read here ties the two co nspiracies together unlike anything you've ever read before.   Appendix Eight is a special overview of some of the more pertinent books (along with some of the outrageous ones) that have appeared over the years about the JFK assassination — a reader's guide to the literature.   Appendix Nine examines the long - secret collaboration between Israel and Red China in the arena of nuclear production and addresses the question as to whether the cancellation (by Lyndon Johnson) of JFK's plans to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 The Tie That Binds [13] launch a military attack on Red China's nuclear facilities was a direct consequence of Israel's role in the JFK assassination conspiracy.   Appendix Ten analyzes the ongoing political crisis in Israel: many Israelis believe that Israeli intelligence had a hand in the assassination o f Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. If that theory is subject to open debate in Israel, why can't Americans ponder the possibility that Israeli intelligence had a hand in the assassination of an American president?   A special supplement to this edition of Final Judgment appears in the form of what was originally published in a separate volume under the title Default Judgment. This is a detailed selection of questions addressed to the author after the initial release of Final Judgment.

I f P r e s i d e n t J o h n F . K e n n e d y w a s k i l l e d b y a c o n s p i r a c y orchestrated — at least in part — by Israel's spy agency, the Mossad, this evidently not be the last time that the Mossad planned the ass assination of an American president. According to former Mossad agent, Victor Ostrovsky, elements of the Mossad were plotting an attempt on the life of President George Bush. The reason: according to Ostrovsky, Bush was hated by the Mossad and considered a n enemy of Israel. This amazing revelation was published in the February 1992 edition of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs. The author of the report was former Congressman Paul Findley (R - Ill.), himself a prominent critic of Israel. (Findley's b est - selling book, They Dare to Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel's Lobby, is a classic exposition of the way Israel's lobby has worked to silence American critics of the foreign nation.) Findley reported that Ostrovsky had learned through his sources in the intelligence community that because of President Bush's seeming intransigence toward Israel's demands, the Mossad had begun coordinating plans for the assassination of the American president. Ostrovsky relayed this information to several members of the Canadian parliament, indicating that the Mossad and not Israel's elected leadership, is \"the real engine of policy in Israel.\" 8 One of those attending the meeting with Ostrovsky passed the information on to another former U.S. Representati ve, Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey (R - Calif.). Upon learning of the potential threat to President Bush, ex - Congressman McCloskey himself flew to Canada where he met with Ostrovsky. According to Findley: \"Ostrovsky impressed McCloskey as a patriotic Zionist who b elieves the Mossad is out of control. Ostrovsky told him the present leadership of the Mossad wants 'to do everything possible to preserve a state of war between Israel and its neighbors, assassinating President Bush, if necessary.\" 9 \"He said a public rel ations campaign is already underway in both Israel and the United States to 'prepare public acceptance of [vice president] Dan Quayle as president.' After lengthy discussion during which he became convinced that Ostrovsky was 'real' and telling the truth, McCloskey took the next flight to Washington."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 Off With His Hea d [15] \"There he relayed the information to the Secret Service and State Department, receiving mixed reactions to Ostrovsky's reliability. An officer of the Navy Department dismissed him simply as a \"traitor to Isra el.\" 10 AMERICANS KILLED BY ISRAELI INTRIGUE Findley points o ut that in his controver sial book, By Way of Deception, the aforementioned Ostrovsky documented a Mossad action which was \"especially shocking to American readers.\" 11 In that instance, 241 U.S. Marines were murdered by a terrorist truck bomb that plowed into the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. Although Israeli agents learned that the attack was impending, the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv ordered its agents to ignore the threat and to not al ert the American servicemen to the danger. \"We are not there [in Beirut] to protect Americans,\" the Mossad leaders explained. \"They're a big country. Send only the regular information.\" According to Ostrovsky, the \"regular information\" was \"like sending a weather report, unlikely to raise any particular alarm.\" 12 \"Is it conceivable,\" asks Findley, \"that Israel's Mossad might assassinate George Bush in order to put a more sympathetic man in the White House? It is well to remember two earlier occasions when I sraeli authorities were willing to sacrifice American lives to serve their own national interests.\" 13 Congressman Findley points out two other occasions where Americans died or otherwise faced extinction at the hands of Israel:   On June 8, 1967, naval and air forces of Israel deliberately — and without provocation — attacked the American spy ship, the U.S.S. Liberty killing 34 American sailors and wounding 171 others. It was an attempt to destroy the ship and its entire crew.   During the October 1973 war, Israel i pilots were ordered to shoot down an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane that was overflying Israel's secret nuclear bomb development site at Dimona. The plane, however, flew too high for Israel's would - be assassins to reach. Assessing the potential threat to President George Bush, Congressman Findley concludes, \"The U.S. Secret Service will be wise to assume the worst.\" 14 Incredibly enough, at almost the same time Findley's provocative report first appeared, several unusual events occurred that seemed to g ive credence to the allegation that there might indeed be a plot afoot to eliminate George Bush — if not physically, at least politically. Each of these threatening incidents took place during President George Bush's January 1992 trip to the Far East. The mo st notable incident, of course, was the President's bizarre public seizure while dining in the company of the Japanese premier. More than a few people speculated — privately — that the president might indeed have been poisoned. This, of course, is speculation, but it is based in reality. Interestingly, it was while the president was on his Far Eastern junket that The Washington Post — the daily newspaper of record in the nation's"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"[16] Final Judgment 77 capitol — inexplicably reversed itself and began publishing a lengthy and glowing sev en - part series hailing Vice President Dan Quayle. Obviously this seems to be a confirmation of Victor Ostrovsky's claim that preparations were being made in the United States to make a Dan Quayle presidency palatable. The Post's unusual flip - flop was made all the more potent when the news arrived that the president had been stricken. Quayle, evidently, already had the Establishment's support if he had been unexpectedly thrust into the presidency. Oddly, prior to the Post's turn - about, the Washington daily h ad been one of Quayle's most persistent critics. However, something quite alarming also took place during that eventful week. A SECURITY BREACH For two days, during President George Bush's visit in Seoul, South Korea, top - secret information regarding the president's personal arrangements was inexplicably made available to the public. Incredibly enough, this was during a period when terrorist alert status was already high. Security experts believed that if potential presidential assassins had such action i n mind, the security breach would have assisted them tremendously. According to Robert Snow, a spokesman for the Secret Service, \"It wouldn't be stretching it\" 15 to suggest that the security lapse could have put Bush in danger. Blame for the lapse in secur ity was laid at the hands of the U.S. Information Service (USIS), a branch of the State Department. For their own part, officials at the State Department were unable to provide an explanation of the bizarre security breach. The White House refused to comme nt. The USIS published a list of the names and hotel room numbers of the president's traveling party, which numbered 471 people. (The fact that the president was staying at the U.S. Ambassador's residence was part of the information revealed.) Included on the list were the names and room numbers of 122 Secret Service agents, eight Marine guards, four presidential stewards and six military aides. Also revealed were security control room locations in the hotel where the president was staying as well as the na mes of the 10 Secret Service agents heading security at the various locations that the president visited while in Korea. The room assignments of top administration officials accompanying the president, as well as those of the thirteen corporate executives along for the trip were also published. 16 This incredible revelation caused suspicion that perhaps there were those in positions of power who may not necessarily have been concerned for the president's safety. The tentacles of Israel's Mossad do reach far and wide — even into the depths of the U.S. State Department. Was this breach of security a first step in an assassination attempt — perhaps one to be carried out by some obscure Korean terrorist group acting as a \"false flag\" for the Mossad? Retired Air Forc e Col. L. Fletcher Prouty, himself an acknowledged authority on covert operations — including assassination planning — says that"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 Off With His Head [17] one of the primary necessary measures in any assassination plot is the process of removing or otherwise breaching the intended vi ctim's blanket of security. Prouty, who worked in presidential security with the military, knows whereof he speaks. According to Prouty, \"No one has to direct an assassination — it happens. The active role is played secretly by permitting it to happen . . . This is the greatest single clue . . . Who has the power to call off or reduce the usual security precautions that are always in effect whenever a president travels?\" 17 IF IN 1991, WHY NOT IN 1963? In his 1994 book, The Other Side of Deception , Mossad m an Victor Ostrovsky finally revealed the specifics of what he had learned of the 1991 Mossad plot against Bush: the Mossad planned to assassinate Bush during an international conference in Madrid. The Mossad had captured three Palestinian \"extremists\" and leaked word to the Spanish police that the terrorists were on their way to Madrid. The plan was to kill Bush, release the \"assassins\" in the midst of the confusion — and kill the Palestinians on the spot. The crime would be blamed on the Palestinians — another Mossad \"false flag,\" more about which we will learn in Chapter Three. 18 SOME HISTORICAL SPECULATION Frankly, there have been those who have suggested, in the wake of the publication of the first edition of Final Judgment , that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in fact, may himself have been the first American president to die at the hands of the intelligence network that ultimately evolved into Israel's Mossad. They point out, based on well - documented historical evidence, that FDR may have been a gen uine roadblock in the way of the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. It is known that Saudi King Abd al - Aziz Ibn Saud met with FDR on board a U.S. Navy ship on February 14, 1945 when the American president was returning from the famous Yalta Conf erence. There, according to former American diplomat Richard Curtiss, the Saudi king \"exacted assurances from the President that he would 'do nothing to assist the Jews against the Arabs and would make no move hostile to the Arab people.'\" 19 After that me eting, according to Curtiss, FDR \"told friends that in a few minutes of conversation with the Saudi monarch he learned more about the Palestine situation than he had learned in all of his previous life. His new knowledge did not prevent him, however, from authorizing a U.S. Zionist leader to state that the President still favored a Jewish state and unrestricted Jewish immigration into Palestine. \"Then, as the Arabs reacted with angry questions, he authorized the Department of State to reaffirm his pledge to Ibn Saud and other Arab leaders that there would be prior consultation with the Arabs as well as the Jews before the U.S. took any action related to Palestine.\" 20 One week later FDR was dead."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"[18] Final Judgment 79 In fact, two authors known for their devotion to the Zionist cause — John Loftus and Mark Aarons — have stated candidly that many friends of Israel do believe that FDR's death was quite fortuitous: \"Although American public opinion was favorable toward Jews, few Zionists trusted Roosevelt entirely . . . As several lead ing Zionists admitted, if Roosevelt had lived, it is unlikely that Israel would ever have been born. They knew what they were talking about.” 21 AN INTERESTING FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY . . . We could speculate forever about how FDR really died. However, we do know — based on a very reliable source — that FDR's successor, Harry Truman, was in fact the target for assassination because he was perceived hostile to Zionist interests. According to Margaret Truman, daughter of the late president, the Jewish underground terrorist movement in Palestine known as the Stern Gang once tried to murder her father. In a biography of her father Miss Truman discussed the attempt on her father's life by Puerto Rican nationalists. Then, in a little - noticed, but highly significant as ide she commented: \"I learned in the course of my research for this book that there had been other attempts on Dad's life, which he never mentioned . . . In the summer of 1947, the so - called Stern gang of Palestine terrorists tried to assassinate Dad by ma il . . .” 22 The Jewish terrorists, it seems, had sent the president letters that had been tainted with toxic chemicals. Fortunately, the mail was intercepted and no harm was done. Harry Truman, of course, got the message, though, and rushed to recognize t he state of Israel upon its founding in 1948, despite his own reservations and those on the part of his diplomatic advisors. This clumsy attempt to kill Truman is interesting, to say the very least, and points to a proclivity for political violence on the part of the Israeli leaders in the Stern Gang whom, it should be pointed out, were the very individuals who emerged as the leaders of the Mossad following the establishment of the state of Israel. A PATTERN OF EVIDENCE . . . Very clearly, there is str ong evidence — indeed a pattern — to suggest that Israel would indeed consider the assassination of an American president. With this in mind, let us move forward and examine the evidence which will lead us toward a final judgment."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter Three A Bad Habit: Is ra el 's Us e o f \"F a ls e F l a g s\" in G lo ba l T erro r is m — P o int i ng t he F ing e r o f G uilt E ls ew here Researchers in the JFK assassination controversy have repeatedly pointed out the false leads that continue to appear.

The use of \"false flag\" operations by Israel and its Mossad has been documented repeatedly since the Jewish State first came into being. This book contends that Israel and its primary collaborator, the CIA, utilized insidi ous \"false flags\" in orchestrating the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the subsequent cover - up: \"the Mafia,\" \"anti - Castro Cubans,\" \"the Soviets,\" \"Castro agents\" and even \"right - wing extremists\" have all been fingered as those responsible for the JFK assassination. But the real hard evidence points in another direction entirely. 'FORGED TRAILS' AND 'FALSE FLAGS' One major JFK assassination researcher, Professor Peter Dale Scott, has described what he called \"the brilliance of the assassination plot.\" 23 This was, according to Scott, \"that the conspirators had forged trails to induce a cover - up.\" Scott cites a number of instances: \"There were, for example, trails that potentially linked Oswald to Fidel Castro or to the KGB and Khruschev — a trail that mig ht lead to war. \"Moreover, there was false evidence given to the Secret Service that led to a group of anti - Castro Cubans in Chicago whose operations had been authorized indirectly by Bobby Kennedy himself. This is just one of several trails that might hav e led in directions that no one wanted to investigate.\" 24 That Israel has had a long and proven record in planting \"false flags\" is the subject of discussion in this chapter. In preparation for our consideration of Israel's role in the JFK assassination co nspiracy, it is worthwhile to first review some of the more"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"[20] Final Judgment 81 notable instances in which Israel orchestrated assassinations and pinned those atrocities on innocent parties — \"false flags.\" In Chapter 2 we noted how former Congressman Paul Findley had cited tw o cases in which Israel indicated a willingness to sacrifice American lives for its own interests: (a) the attack on the U.S.S. Liberty in June of 1967 and (b) the intended attack on an American reconnaissance plane that was overflying Israel's secret nucl ear bomb development site. These incidents are particularly intriguing in light of what we will ponder in this volume. The attack on the Liberty — it is generally acknowledged by everyone but Israel and its defenders — was a deliberate attempt to destroy the L iberty and its crew and to sink the vessel to the bottom of the Mediterranean. What is most interesting, however, is the reason behind this bizarre and brutal attack. TH E U. S. S. LIB ERTY — BLAM ING TH E EGYP TIANS Israel, in fact, hoped to pin the responsibili ty on a \"false flag\" — Egypt — and draw the United States into the impending 1967 war on the side of Israel. It is only because the Liberty did not sink and instead was rescued that the history books don't tell us today that \"the Arabs\" sunk an American spy sh ip and sparked another \"Lusitania incident\" that forced America to go to war. THE NUCLEAR BOMB The second instance to which Congressman Findley referred is of special interest inasmuch as the intended attack on an American air force reconnaissance plane was designed to protect Israel's secret development of nuclear weaponry. It was Israel's nuclear offensive that led President John F. Kennedy into the \"secret war\" with Israel that he conducted with increasing intensity during the three years of his short - lived presidency. As we shall see in Chapter 5, it was the very issue of Kennedy's intransigent opposition to Israel's nuclear arms development that became a central part of his standoff with Israel and its Mossad. It was this conflict that played a critic al part in setting in final motion the assassination conspiracy that ended John Kennedy's life. What follows is an overview of some other notable instances in which Israel utilized 'false flags\" in its international criminal endeavors. THE LAVON AFFAIR Perhaps the best - known instance in which Israel used a \"false flag\" to cover its own trail was in the infamous Lavon Affair. It was in 1954 that several Israeli - orchestrated acts of terrorism against British targets in Egypt were carried out. Blame for the attacks was placed on the Muslim Brotherhood, which opposed the regime of Egyptian President Gamul"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 A Bad Habit [21] Abdul - Nasser. However, the truth about the wave of terror can now be found in a once - secret cable from Colonel Benjamin Givli, the head of Israel's milita ry intelligence, who outlined the intended purpose behind the wave of terror: \"[Our goal] is to break the West's confidence in the existing [Egyptian] regime. The actions should cause arrests, demonstrations, and expressions of revenge. The Israeli origin should be totally covered while attention should be shifted to any other possible factor. The purpose is to prevent economic and military aid from the West to Egypt.\" 25 Ultimately the truth about Israel's involvement in the affair became public and Israel was rocked internally in the wake of the scandal. Competing political elements within Israel used the scandal as a bludgeon against their opponents. But the truth about Israel's use of a \"false flag\" had come to international attention and demonstrated ho w Israel was indeed willing to needlessly endanger innocent lives as part of its grand political strategy to expand its influence in the Middle East. B LAM ING 'RIGHT - WING EXTREM ISTS' A shadowy \"right wing\" group known as \"Direct Action\" was accused of the attack on Goldenberg's Deli in Paris on August 9, 1982. Six people died and 22 were injured. The leader of \"Direct Action\" was one Jean - Marc Rouillan. Rouillan had been operating in the Mediterranean under the cover name of \"Sebas\" and had been repeatedly linked to the Mossad. All references to Rouillan's Mossad links were deleted from the official reports issued at the time. However, the Algerian national news service — which has ties to French intelligence — blamed the Mossad for Rouillan's activities. Angry French intelligence officers were believed to have leaked this information to the Algerians. Several top French security officials quit in protest over this cover - up of Mossad complicity in Rouillan's crimes. 26 However, other Mossad - orchestrated false fl ag operations also took place on French soil. On October 3, 1980 a synagogue on Copernicus Street was bombed in Paris. Four bystanders were killed. Nine were injured. The media frenzy which followed the incident was worldwide. Reports held that \"right wing extremists\" were responsible. Yet, of all of the \"right wing extremists\" held for questioning, none was arrested. In fact, all were released. In the upper echelons of French intelligence, however, the finger of suspicion was pointed at the Mossad. Accordi ng to one report: \"On April 6, 1979, the same Mossad terror unit now suspected of the Copernicus carnage blew up the heavily guarded plant of CNIM industries at La Seyne - sur - Mer, near Toulon, in southeast France, where a consortium of French firms was buil ding a nuclear reactor for Iraq. \"The Mossad salted the site of the CNIM bomb blast with 'clues' followed up with anonymous phone calls to police — suggesting that the sabotage was the work of a 'conservative' environmentalist Troup — 'the most pacific and har mless people on earth' as one source put it.\" 27"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"[22] Final Judgment 83 BLAM ING THE CORSICAN M AFIA   On June 28, 1978, Israeli agents exploded a bomb under a small passenger car in the Rue Saint Anne, killing Mohammed Boudia, an organizer for the Palestine Liberation Organizati on (PLO). Immediately afterward, Paris police received anonymous phone calls accusing Boudia of involvement in narcotics deals and attributing his murder to the Corsican Mafia. A thorough investigation subsequently established that Mossad special - action ag ents were responsible for the terrorist killing. BLAMING THE NEO - NAZIS   In October, 1976 the same Mossad unit kidnapped two West German students named Brigette Schulz and Thomas Reuter from their Paris hotel. Planted \"clues\" and anonymous phone calls made it appear that a Bavarian \"neo - nazi\" formation had executed the abduction. In fact, French intelligence established that the two German youths had been secretly flown to Israel, drugged, tortured, coerced into a false \"confession of complicity\" in PLO act ivities, and then anonymously incarcerated in one of the Israeli government's notorious political prisons. BLAM ING THE SO UTH KOREANS   In February 1977 a German - born, naturalized U.S. citizen named William Jahnke arrived in Paris for some secretive busines s meetings. He soon vanished, leaving no trace. Paris police were anonymously informed that Jahnke had been involved in a high - level South Korean bribery affair and \"eliminated\" when the deal went sour. A special team of investigators from SDECE, the leadi ng French intelligence agency, eventually determined that Jahnke had been \"terminated\" by the Mossad, which suspected him of selling secret information to the Libyans. Along with other details of this sordid case, the SDECE learned that Jahnke had been \"fi ngered\" to the Mossad by his own former employer, the CIA. 28 BLAMING THE LIBYANS One of Israel's most outrageous \"false flag\" operations involved a wild propaganda story aimed at discrediting Libyan leader Muamar Qaddafi — one of Israel's favorite enemies. In the early months of the administration of President Ronald Reagan, the American media began heavily promoting a story to the effect that a \"Libyan hit squad\" was in the United States for the express purpose of assassinating Reagan. This inflamed public sentiment against Libya and there were repeated calls for blood. Suddenly, however, the \"hit squad\" stories vanished. In fact, it was ultimately discovered that the source of the story was one Manucher Ghorbanifar, a former Iranian SAVAK (secret police) a gent with close ties"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 A Bad Habit [23] to the Mossad. Even The Washington Post acknowledged that the CIA itself believed that Ghorbanifar was a liar who \"had made up the hit - squad story in order to cause problems for one of Israel's enemies.\" 29 The Los Angeles Times itse lf had already blown the whistle on Israel's scare stories. \"Israeli intelligence, not the Reagan administration,\" reported the Times, \"was a major source of some of the most dramatic published reports about a Libyan assassination team allegedly sent to ki ll President Reagan and other top U.S. officials . . . Israel, which informed sources said has 'wanted an excuse to go in and bash Libya for a longtime,' may be trying to build American public support for a strike against [Qaddafi], these sources said.\" 30 In other words, Israel had been promoting the former SAVAK agent, Ghorbanifar, to official Washington as a reliable source. In fact, he was a Mossad disinformation operative waving a \"false flag\" to mislead America. This was yet another Israeli scheme to blame Libya for its own misdeeds, this time using one \"false flag\" (Iran's SAVAK) to lay the blame on another \"false flag\" (Libya). (In Chapter 18 we shall see yet another SAVAK crime carried out on behalf of Israel and its allies in the CIA.) BLAMING LIB YA AGAIN Israel's Mossad was almost certainly responsible for the bombing of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin on April 5, 1986. However, claims were made that there was \"irrefutable\" evidence that the Libyans were responsible. A U.S. serviceman was killed. President Ronald Reagan responded with an attack on Libya. However, intelligence insiders believed that Israel's Mossad had concocted the phony \"evidence\" to \"prove\" Libyan responsibility. West Berlin police director Manfred Ganschow, who took cha rge of the investigation, cleared the Libyans, saying, \"This is a highly political case. Some of the evidence cited in Washington may not be evidence at all, merely assumptions supplied for political reasons.\" 31 BLAMING THE SYRIANS On April 18, 1986 one Nezar Hindawi, a 32 year old Jordanian was arrested in London after security guards found that one of the passengers boarding an Israeli plane bound for Jerusalem, Ann Murphy, 22, was carrying a square, flat sheet of plastic explosive in the double bottom of her carry - on bag. Miss Murphy told security men that the detonator (disguised as a calculator) had been given to her by her finance, Hindawi. He was charged with attempted sabotage and attempted murder. Word was leaked that Hindawi had confessed and cl aimed that he had been hired by Gen. Mohammed Al - Khouli, the intelligence director of the Syrian air force. Also implicated were others including the Syrian Ambassador in London. The French authorities warned the British Prime"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"[24] Final Judgment 85 Minister that there was mor e to the case than met the eye — that is, Israeli involvement. This was later confirmed in reports in the Western press. 32 BLAMING THE PLO In 1970, King Hussein of Jordan was provided with incriminating intelligence that suggested the Palestine Liberation Organization was plotting to murder him and seize power in his nation. Infuriated, Hussein mobilized his forces for what has become known as the 'Black September' purge of the PLO. Thousands of Palestinians living in Jordan were rounded up, some of the le aders were tortured, and in the end, masses of refugees were driven from Jordan to Lebanon. New data, coming to light after the murder of two leading Mossad operatives in Larnaka, Cyprus suggested that the entire operation had been a Mossad covert action, led by one of its key operatives, Sylvia Roxburgh. She contrived an affair with King Hussein and served as the linchpin for a major Mossad coup designed to destabilize the Arabs. 33 In 1982, just when the PLO had abandoned the use of terrorism, the Mossad spread disinformation about \"terror attacks\" on Israeli settlements along the northern border in order to justify a full - scale military invasion of Lebanon. Years later, even leading Israeli spokesmen, such as former Foreign Minister Abba Eban, admitted th at the reports of \"PLO terrorism\" had been contrived by the Mossad. 34 It is also worth noting that the attempted assassination — in London — of Israeli Ambassador to England, Shlomo Argov, was initially blamed upon the PLO. The attempted assassination was cit ed by Israel as one excuse for its bloody 1982 incursion into Lebanon. In fact, the diplomat in question was considered one of Israel's \"doves\" and inclined toward a friendly disposition of Israel's longtime conflict with the PLO. He was the least likely t arget of PLO wrath. What's more, one of the suspects in the crime was found carrying a \"hit list\" which actually included the name of the head of the PLO office in London. 35 Thus, it appears that the assassination attempt was carried out by the Mossad — un der yet another \"false flag\" — for two purposes: (a) elimination of a domestic \"peacenik\" considered friendly toward the Palestinians; and (b) pinning yet another crime on the Palestine Liberation Organization. WH Y F RAM E O SWALD AS A 'P RO - CASTRO AGITA TO R'? These instances cited here are but a handful of Mossad - orchestrated \"false flag\" operations blamed on a wide variety of alleged \"suspects.\" The evidence that we shall be examining in Final Judgment suggests that the assassination of John F. Kennedy was yet another \"false flag\" conspiracy by Israel's Mossad and its collaborators in the American CIA. We now know, based upon years of study by numerous JFK assassination researchers, that prior to the JFK assassination, the accused"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 A Bad Habit [25] assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was being set up as a patsy. Indeed, Oswald's activities were presented as proof that a \"pro - Castro agitator\" had been the \"lone nut\" behind the president's assassination. If anything — we should note at this juncture — Lee Harvey Oswald's identity as a \"pro - Castro agitator\" — the role he played prior to the JFK assassination — was tailor - made for (or, perhaps we should say, tailor - made by) the CIA and its allies in the Mossad. What few JFK assassination researchers have noted (or perhaps even understood) was that Fidel Castro's Cuba had long been hostile to Israel and the cause of Zionism. Thus, both the Mossad and the CIA would find a \"pro - Castro agitator\" an ideal patsy. In a lengthy essay the Castro government published in the November 4, 1979 edition of Granma — an official newspaper — the Cuban Marxists critiqued Israel and Zionism. Castro's newspaper said, in part: \"The Zionists never did, and never will, forgive the Soviet state and its Leninist Party . . . because the Bolsheviks implemented a correct policy tha t incorporated the talents and efforts of the Soviet Jews into the tasks of building a new society and thus demonstrated the class origins of discrimination and anti - Semitism, breaking with the past and providing a genuine solution to the Jewish problem, a solution which was not and could never be a massive exodus to Palestine. \"With the outbreak of the cold war the Zionists collaborated in all the subversive and diversionary activities against the USSR and other socialist countries. The secret services of the Zionist state of Israel coordinated their spy activities with the CIA. And to complete the picture there is the Zionist counter - revolutionary action against the national liberation movements. \"The Zionists became a power and succeeded in establishing t heir own state in 1948. Now their task is to defend oil routes, protect all the interests of U.S. imperialism and block the advance of the Arab revolution. Neither the machinations of Zionist counterrevolution, nor Israeli arms, can hold back the victoriou s march of the peoples of the world.\" 36 These are fighting words, to say the least, and do explain perhaps why those who were responsible for framing Lee Harvey Oswald would have selected his profile as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" The profile would satisfy b oth the hard - line anti - communists and the Zionists. In subsequent years, as the initial cover story that Oswald was a pro - Castro agitator began to unravel and new fallback targets have been named — primarily \"the Mafia.\" It was the Mossad and its allies in t he CIA and in the controlled American media who have been doing all the fingering. Everybody being blamed by the Mossad and its CIA allies were implicated and everybody, as a consequence, had a stake in the cover - up . JFK AND SECRET DEALS To achieve the p residency in 1960, John F. Kennedy was forced to cut secret deals — behind the scenes — with a variety of powerful forces intricately linked to Israel. In Chapter 4 we shall examine the history of those deals and how they played a part in the JFK assassination conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Chapter Four No Love Lost: J F K , M ey er La nsky , t he M a f ia & t he Isra eli Lo bby T h e r e w a s a l o n g h i s t o r y o f b i t t e r e n m i t y b e t w e e n J o h n F.

John F. Kennedy was very much a product of his father's upbringing — much to the dismay, it might be said, of many of even JFK's most devout disciples. They would, frankly, prefer to forget much of the recorded history of the Kennedy family and present JFK as something just short of being a saint. That President John F. Kennedy was the son of Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy long perceived to be, at the very least, neutral to the ambitions of Nazi Germany — and, at the worst, an anti - Semite and even an admirer of Adolf Hitler — has been a lot for Kennedy's admirers to swallow. Ambassador Kennedy, of course, fought U.S. entry into World War II. Several accounts of the period suggest that Kennedy himself returned from Britain, where he served as American ambassador, with the intent of launching a major campaign against President Roosevelt's war plans. However, after a meeting at the White House between the ambassador and the president, Kennedy backed off. What happened during that meeting is ripe for speculation. JFK, HITLER AND THE WA R IN EUROPE What is interesting to note (and definitely little known) is that at the same time Ambassador Kennedy was fighting against American involvement in what became the Second World War, his sons Joe, Jr. and John were also promoting the same agenda ."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 No Love Lost [27] Joe, Jr., as a student at Harvard, served on the Harvard Committee Against Military Intervention in Europe, described as \"a reactionary group that petitioned influential government officials and held rallies opposing American entry in the European war effort.\" 37 More significantly, however, it appears that JFK himself was under steady surveillance by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI because of his anti - war activities. JFK was accused by the FBI of voicing \"anti - British and defeatist sentiments and blaming Winston Churchill for getting the United States into the war . . . It also appears,\" charged the FBI, \"that Kennedy had prepared for his father at least one of the speeches which his father had made, or was intending to make, in answer to criticism of his alleged appeasement policies . . . In addition Jack Kennedy stated that in his opinion England was through, and his father's greatest mistake was not talking enough, that he stopped talking too soon.\" 38 Young Jack Kennedy, as a Harvard student, was more than neut ral toward Hitler, it seems. Having visited Mussolini's Italy, Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany, JFK recorded in his diary, according to Time magazine, that he had come \"to the decision that Facism [sic] is the thing for Germany and Italy, Communism fo r Russia and Democracy for America and England.\" 39 Youthful musings, but interesting, to say the least . KENNEDY AND THE 'FASCIST' After the war was underway, JFK's father, Ambassador Kennedy, actively considered involvement in a scheme to cut the war sho rt — in opposition to President Roosevelt. Kennedy's biographer, Richard Whalen, has written of a secret meeting between Kennedy and a prominent critic of the Roosevelt administration, the controversial publicist, Lawrence Dennis. Often described (inaccurate ly) as \"America's leading fascist,\" Dennis was a former diplomat himself and one of the early leaders in the effort to block American intervention in what evolved into World War II. Consequently, he and Kennedy had much in common. Kennedy's biographer outl ined the circumstances of that secret meeting — a meeting which says much about Kennedy's line of thinking: \"In October 1943, Lawrence Dennis received a telephone call from his friend, Paul Palmer, then a senior editor of The Reader's Digest. Before the war, Dennis had contributed to the Digest, but the author of The Coming American Fascism since had become too controversial for his byline to appear in the nation's largest magazine. Now he received a $500 - a - month retainer as an editorial consultant. \"One of h is recent efforts had been a memorandum sharply critical of unconditional surrender and the rumored plans to break up Germany. Palmer invited Dennis to lunch in his suite in Manhattan's St. Regis Hotel, saying he would meet someone there who was thinking a long similar lines. \"It turned out to be Joe Kennedy. Over lunch, Kennedy said he had been seeing Archbishop Spellman almost daily. He said the Archbishop had"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"[28] Final Judgment 89 returned from Rome with word that Hitler's generals might attempt to overthrow him if they were offered terms less hopeless than unconditional surrender. \"Kennedy grew emotional and castigated Roosevelt. He talked of his two sons in the service, and declared that the war could be ended within two weeks if the German generals were given encouragement . \"Of course, no Church official could speak out against the folly of Roosevelt's policy, but Kennedy could, and this had been Palmer's purpose in arranging the luncheon. The editor asked whether the former Ambassador would write, or at least sign, an arti cle condemning unconditional surrender. The impact of such an article, given Kennedy's former standing in the administration, could be enormous. But he did not accept the invitation and the war being fought by his sons and so many other young men raged on. ” 40 Ambassador Kennedy no doubt remembered this meeting for the rest of his days. He was very bitter about the war and particularly bitter at Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kennedy once allegedly referred to FDR as \"that crippled son of a bitch that killed my so n Joe.\" (Joe Kennedy, Jr., of course, being the ambassador's eldest son. It was Joe, Jr.'s death that ultimately laid the groundwork for the second son, John, to be groomed for the presidency in his older brother's place.) A BUSINESS VENTURE However, the senior Kennedy's views most definitely did not change as time went by. But as the retired ambassador grew older, he became more pragmatic. This was evidenced in a meeting — in the mid - 1950's — between Kennedy and an associate of Lawrence Dennis — a New York - bas ed entertainment executive named DeWest Hooker. In fact, as we shall see, it may have been efforts by Hooker, as a consequence of his meeting with Joe Kennedy, that helped John F. Kennedy win his narrow victory in the 1960 presidential election. Mr. Hooker hoped to interest Joe Kennedy in a business venture which Hooker believed might be right up the ambassador's alley. Hooker wanted to establish an independent television network, and he felt that Kennedy, himself a veteran movie mogul, might be interested in backing the enterprise. Hooker's memory of that meeting is quite interesting, particularly in the context of the thesis presented in these pages. To appreciate just precisely where Hooker was coming from, however, it is appropriate to review Hooker's re markable background. UNABASHEDLY ANTI - JEWISH Born to wealth and privilege and a descendent of one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Hooker had a varied career. Not only did he act on the Broadway stage, but he also modeled in cigarette a dvertisements. Hooker also served for a period as a talent agent with the powerful firm"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 No Love Lost [29] MCA and was, at a time during the 1950's one of the highest - paid talent agents in America. Hooker also dabbled in television production and was equally successful. Ho wever, there was an aspect to Hooker's persona that made him, to say the least, persona non grata in the entertainment industry: Hooker is unabashedly and frankly anti - Jewish. He will be the first to admit it, no questions asked. A powerfully - built man, Ho oker is fearless and not afraid to make his position known. One of Hooker's protégés was George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. In his memoirs, This Time the World, Rockwell credits Hooker as being a major influence on his thinking. I n fact, Rockwell dedicated the book to Hooker, along with several others including Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and General Douglas MacArthur. Hooker, Rockwell declared, was the one \"who taught me to know the cunning and evil ways of the enemy.\" 41 According to Rockwell, Hooker was \"the nearest thing to a Nazi since the Bund.\" 42 The reason for Hooker's interest in establishing an independent network was highly political: Hooker wanted the new network to be totally divorced from Jewish money and influence. In his judgment, the three existing networks were entirely under the control of Jewish interests. Hooker wanted a network that presented what he called \"our way of thinking .\" JOE KENNEDY SPEAKS FRANKLY It was in 1956 that Hooker had a private meeting in Palm B each, Florida with Kennedy. After a game of golf, Kennedy and Hooker got down to business. Hooker was there to solicit Kennedy's financial, political and personal backing for his proposed network. (It was during this period that Sen. John F. Kennedy was th en actively seeking the Democratic Party's vice presidential nomination. He lost, but his efforts brought him widespread acclaim within party ranks, and set in place the mechanism for his successful bid for the top spot on the party's national ticket in 19 60.) After Hooker made his presentation to the retired ambassador, Kennedy's response was supportive in spirit, but Old Joe made his final position clear during their four - hour conference. According to Hooker, \"Joe admitted that when he was ambassador to E ngland that he had been pro - Hitler. However, in Kennedy's words, 'we' lost the war. By 'we' he didn't mean the United States. When Kennedy said `we,' he meant the non - Jews. Joe Kennedy believed that it was the Jews who had won World War II. \"Kennedy said, 'I've done everything I can to fight the Jewish power over this country. I tried to stop World War II, but I failed. I've made all the money I need and now I'm passing everything I've learned on to my sons.\" “ I don't go with the 'loser',\" Kennedy told me. 'I've joined the `winners.' I'm going to work with the Jews. I'm teaching my boys the whole score and they're going to work with the Jews. I'm going to make"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"[30] Final Judgment 91 Jack the first Irish Catholic President of the United States and if it means working with the Jew s, so be it. I'm in sympathy with what you're doing, Hooker',\" Kennedy said, 'but I'm not going to do anything that will ruin Jack's chances to become president.\"' 43 Hooker was, of course, disappointed by Kennedy's response and ultimately his \"fourth\" net work failed to get off the ground. However, Hooker at least had the satisfaction of knowing that he and the Kennedy family were on the same wavelength — even if they were willing to compromise those views for political gain. THE NAZIS 'ENDORSE' NIXON As th ey parted at the end of their Palm Beach meeting, Hooker asked Kennedy if there was anything he could do to help the Kennedy family. \"Yes, as a matter of fact, there is something you can do.\" responded Joe Kennedy. \"I'd like you to use your contacts in the right - wing. Have them start publishing articles accusing Jack of being controlled by the Jews, of being a Jewish puppet. This will have the effect of neutralizing Jewish opposition to Jack (because of me). \"The Jews know my views and naturally they'll ass ume that Jack is a chip off the old block. If the right wing starts hitting Jack this will give the Jews second thoughts — at least the ones who do the voting.\" 44 Hooker promised Kennedy he would do what he could. And being a man of his word, Hooker did inf luence his right - wing contacts as Kennedy had asked. Hooker encouraged his friend, Nazi leader Rockwell, and other \"right wingers\" to smear John F. Kennedy as JFK's father had suggested. His efforts succeed. As one chronicle of the 1960 campaign noted: \"Th e American Nazi Party helped too by throwing its support to Richard Nixon — \"Nazis for Nixon, Kikes for Kennedy\" was one of its slogans. Another of its placards read, \"FDR and JFK mean JEW deal.\" 45 This, of course, was inspired by JFK's father and carried ou t through the good offices of DeWest Hooker and his friend George Lincoln Rockwell, although the historian who penned the description of Rockwell's sloganeering probably had no idea that it was indirectly the work of Joe Kennedy. \"Frankly,\" Hooker says to this day, \"As far as I'm concerned, it was my work that got Johnny Kennedy in the White House.\" 46 (Hooker's claim is not completely off the mark, inasmuch as American Jewish leaders claimed themselves at the time that it was Jewish support for John F. Kenn edy that gave him his narrow victory over Nixon in the 1960 election.) T his interesting — and revealing — episode is not likely to be memorialized at the John F. Kennedy Library at Harvard or in any friendly biographies of the Kennedy family. However, there ca n be little doubt that Israel and its American lobby had a fairly good idea of what was going on behind the scenes."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 No Love Lost [31] KENNEDY RILES TH E ISRAELI LOBBY In 1957, while serving in his first Senate term, John Kennedy became involved in a festering internationa l issue that was little noticed among the average American voters, but which was of special interest to Israel and its lobby in America: the question of Algerian independence. The giant Arab colossus, long a French colony, was seeking its freedom and in Fr ance itself the nation was engaged in a heated debate over the question. Israel, of course, saw the emergence of another independent Arab republic as a threat to its security and anyone favoring Algerian independence was, thus, advocating a policy deemed t hreatening to Israel's survival. Former diplomat Richard Curtiss described Kennedy's surprise entry into the debate over Algeria: \"By 1957, as a freshman member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he thought he recognized [the] tragedy of colonial i nflexibility unfolding in Algeria. Already one of the congressional library's heaviest borrowers, he now spent additional time in conversation with William J. Porter, an Arabist and the director of the State Department's Office of North African Affairs. \"P orter feared that Washington's uncritical support of its NATO ally, France, in the increasingly brutal French repression of the Algerian nationalists, threatened the whole future of the United States in North Africa. Kennedy also talked to members of the A lgerian FLN delegation at the United Nations.\" 47 On July 2, 1957, JFK rose before the Senate and gave his maiden foreign policy address on this controversial question. He said, in part: \"No amount of mutual politeness, wishful thinking, nostalgia or regre t should blind either France or the United States to the fact that, if France and the West at large are to have a continuing influence in North Africa . . . the essential first step is the independence of Algeria.\" 48 According to Curtiss: \"The speech prom pted more mail than any other he delivered as a senator. The foreign policy establishment in New York, a bastion of Atlantic solidarity, expressed righteous indignation.\" 49 Also, notes Curtiss, \"the French were irritated.\" 50 Some of Kennedy's critics sai d that the speech was a political move and that he chose the topic of Algerian independence as the subject of his first major foreign policy address because there was neither a \"French\" vote nor an \"Algerian\" vote to contend with in his home state of Massa chusetts or in the nation as a whole. While the latter observation is correct, of course, the fact is that there was one particularly powerful American voting bloc (and source of financial contributions) that did take note of Kennedy's support for Algerian Arab independence: the powerful American lobby for Israel. As we shall see, in the end, it may have been JFK's initiative on the Algerian question that, in fact, played a major part in shaping the entirety of the conspiracy that ended his life in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. This gesture by the young senator also angered many French nationalists who wanted to retain French colonial control of Algeria. Many"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"[32] Final Judgment 93 of these nationalists later banded together in the so - called Secret Army Organization — the Is rael - backed OAS — and fought against French President Charles DeGaulle who ultimately granted Algerian independence. In Chapter 12, Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 we will learn more about the so - called \"French connection\" and how, indeed, it ultimately played a r ole in the JFK murder, manipulated by Israel's Mossad . KENNEDY AND LANSKY Kennedy had other powerful enemies. An ancient enmity also stood between Joseph P. Kennedy and Meyer Lansky, the foremost Jewish mob boss in America. (In Chapter 7 we shall examine Lansky's history in more detail.) The conflict between JFK and Lansky, however, went back to the days of the president's father's own bootlegging activities. According to JFK assassination expert, Jim Marrs: \"In 1927, a shipment of bootleg whiskey on its way from Ireland to Boston was hijacked in southern New England. Almost the entire guard was killed in the resulting shootout. The hijackers were part of the Luciano - Lansky mob, while it was rumored that Joseph P. Kennedy was involved in the shipment. Kenn edy reputedly lost a fortune on the deal and was besieged by widows of the guards seeking financial assistance. Lansky later told biographers he was convinced that Kennedy held a grudge against him personally from that time on and, in fact, had passed the hostility on to his sons.\" 51 Long - time Lansky henchman Michael Milan lends support for Marrs’ allegation. According to Milan, \"Ask Meyer Lansky about Joe Kennedy and you'd see one of the few times that Mr. L. would actually get conniptions. What they said back during Prohibition was that you can't trust Joe Kennedy to keep his word. He stole from his friends so much that he had no friends. And right before World War II, the sonovabitch turned around and said that we should all get on Hitler's side, that the Jews could go to Hell. \"Meyer was ready to bust a blood vessel. His temples were actually throbbing when Sam Koenig told him what Kennedy had said. And then Meyer, almost like he was a born Sicilian, swore a blood revenge on the entire family. 'The sins o f the father,' he kept on saying to himself, mumbling like an old zeydah vowing revenge. ‘The sins of the father.’” 52 The conflict between Lansky and Joseph P. Kennedy was but one facet of Kennedy's relationship with organized crime. It was a relationship of many parts, and, in the end, clearly had a significant role in helping shape the conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Ambassador Kennedy's son who had, in fact, finally achieved the presidency. A DOUBLE CROSS Commenting on the theory that organized crime killed JFK (a theory with which Fox concurs), historian Stephen Fox noted that \"Gangsters did not normally harm honest lawmen,\" 53 such as a president like Kennedy"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 No Love Lost [33] whose administration had begun cracking down on the national crime syndica te. However, notes Fox, \"For such an extraordinary murder — to kill a president — they must have been extraordinarily provoked. In their terms, it could only have involved a double cross. The Kennedys must have dealt with the underworld in compromising ways. W hen the Kennedys then turned around and nonetheless went after organized crime, they breached the code and put a contract on the President.\" 54 Fox notes that while old Joe Kennedy was an inveterate gambler, with many ties to the underworld, \"given his vas t wealth, no matter how much he lost the underworld could never have 'owned' him.\" 55 Joe Kennedy himself was a regular visitor to Meyer Lansky's Colonial Inn, which Lansky co - owned with New York Mafia boss Frank Costello and an assortment of smaller share holders including a little - known Dallas nightclub keeper named Jack Ruby. Lansky himself used to brag that among his clients included, \"judges, senators, respectable businessmen. Joe Kennedy used to come four or five times a week.\" 56 However, as the senior Kennedy's son Jack moved upward in the political arena, his father tried to shut out his past relationship with Frank Costello. According to one of Costello's friends, \"The way [Costello] talked about [Joe Kennedy], you had the sense that they were close during Prohibition and then something happened. Frank said that he helped Kennedy become wealthy. What happened between them I don't know.\" 57 KENNEDY AND CRIME It took the family of Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. According to Sam Giancana (nephew of the Windy City mobster) and Chuck Giancana (brother of the mobster), JFK — and his father — had indeed double crossed organized crime. According to the Giancanas, Detroit's \"Jewish Mafia,\" the so - called \"Purple Gang\" had put out a contract on Joe Kennedy's life for bringing illegal liquor through their territory without their permission during the Prohibition days. However, Kennedy Sr. had gone to Chicago to beg for his life and the Chicago Mafia bosses interven ed on his behalf, saving his life. As the Giancana's put it: \"Ever after, Kennedy was in Chicago's debt.\" 58 The relationship went much deeper, however. According to the Giancanas: \"Kennedy's ties to the underworld intersected at a hundred points. Besides making a fortune in bootlegging, Kennedy had made a financial killing in Hollywood in the twenties — with the help of persuasive behind - the - scenes New York and Chicago muscle. \"When Prohibition came to a close, as part of a national agreement between the var ious bootleggers, Kennedy held on to three of the most lucrative booze distributorships in the country — Gordon's gin, Dewar's, and Haig & Haig — through his company, Somerset Imports.\" 59"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"[34] Final Judgment 95 The Giancanas also say that it was Sam Giancana who smoothed things o ver with Frank Costello on Joe Kennedy's behalf after Ambassador Kennedy had snubbed the New York mobster. According to the Giancanas, Kennedy was concerned about his son's burgeoning political career and it was at that point that he agreed to cut a deal w ith organized crime in order to ensure smooth sailing — and in order to get Frank Costello, in Kennedy's words, \"off my back.\" 60 A PROMISE TO THE MOB After Joe Kennedy begged for Giancana's assistance at a meeting in Chicago, Giancana reportedly said, \"I' ve heard nothing today that leads me to think that you can promise me anything in return for my assistance.\" Kennedy responded: \"I can. And I will. You help me now, Sam, and I'll see to it that Chicago — that you — can sit in the godamned Oval office if you wa nt. That you'll have the President's ear. But I just need time.\" Kennedy told Giancana, \"He'll be your man. I swear to that. My son — the President of the United States — will owe you his father's life. He won't refuse you, ever. You have my word.\" 61 JFK, TH E MAFIA AND MEYER LANSKY It was during the 1960 Democratic Presidential primary campaign that the Kennedys once again turned to Giancana for critical Mafia support. In fact, according to the Giancanas, the Kennedys — father and son — actually met with Sam Gia ncana to work out a joint agreement of mutual support, before — and after — the election. As Giancana summarized the agreement: \"I help get Jack elected and, in return, he calls off the heat. It'll be business as usual.\" 62 Mafia money poured into critical pri mary states such as West Virginia (where many local political leaders were on the Mafia \"pad\") and by convention time, JFK was virtually assured the presidential nomination. Although New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello preferred Texas Senator Lyndon Joh nson, an agreement was cut, and a Kennedy - Johnson ticket was set in place. The Democratic ticket was ready for the fall election. 63 (In Chapter 10 we shall explore the relationship between Carlos Marcello and Meyer Lansky in detail. Marcello, in fact, was a protégé of Lansky — his New Orleans front man, pure and simple.) It turns out, too, that JFK himself was busy with other mob figures other than Sam Giancana, although the history books have discreetly ignored JFK's other crime connections, preferring inste ad to focus on the Italian - American \"Mafia\" figures. According to FBI documents and wiretaps, JFK himself had \"direct contact\" 64 with Meyer Lansky himself during the 1960 presidential campaign, presumably for the purpose of shoring up mob support for his p residential campaign — a pact that would ultimately prove to have been a proverbial deal with the devil."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 No Love Lost [35] PROBLEM S WITH TH E ISRAELI LOBBY During this same period JFK was also engaged with critical negotiations with another important power bloc in American political affairs: the pro - Israel lobby. For obvious reasons, as we have seen, there was indeed no love lost between JFK, his father, Ambassador Kennedy, and the American Jewish community. Writing in his book, The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy, Edward Tivnan comments: \"Senator Kennedy's record on Israel was vague, certainly not as staunchly supportive as Hubert Humphrey's. And unlike Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy did not rush to Israel's defense during the Suez affair. \"He was also a C atholic. Many Jews associated American Catholics with right - wing, pro - McCarthy, and anti - Semitic causes. Worse, there was the touchy issue of the candidate's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, who, as ambassador to Great Britain in the late 1930's, had been a supp orter of Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasing the Nazis.\" 65 Kennedy's 1957 speech calling for Algerian independence, as we have seen, had not gone over well with Israel's American supporters. Angering the Israeli lobby further, Senator Kennedy had on ce offered an amendment that would have slashed economic assistance to Africa and the Middle East from $175 to $140 million, this despite the fact that pro - Israel senators said that this was harmful to Israel. 66 ABRAHAM FEINBERG However, John F. Kennedy was ready to deal, and he made moves to appease the pro - Israel lobby. JFK, according to Edward Tivnan, \"turned out to be a better diplomat than his father.\" 67 Kennedy's contact with the Israeli lobby was New York apparel manufacturer and financier, Abrah am Feinberg. Feinberg was president of the Israel Bond Organization and was helping raise private money to finance Israel's secret nuclear development program. (The financing was done through private, covert means and outside the normal Israeli budget proc ess because the nuclear development program was controversial, in the eyes of not only the Eisenhower administration in Washington but also in the eyes of many Israelis.) Referring to Kennedy, Feinberg later said, \"My path to power was cooperation in terms of what they needed — campaign money.\" 68 (Feinberg, himself had previously supported JFK's fellow Senator Stuart Symington, a rival for the 1960 Democratic nomination.) Recognizing the need for not only critical Jewish money, but also Jewish votes, Kennedy arranged to meet with Feinberg and a host of other wealthy Jewish Americans in Feinberg's New York apartment. Following a discussion with Kennedy, Feinberg and his associates agreed to come up"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"[36] Final Judgment 97 with $500,000 on Kennedy's behalf. According to Feinberg: \"I called him right away. His voice broke. He got emotional\" with gratitude. 69 KENNEDY'S 'OUTRAGE' However, there was much more to the story according to author Seymour Hersh who has investigated Kennedy's relations with Israel and its American lobby: \"Ken nedy was anything but grateful the next morning in describing the session to Charles L. Bartlett, a newspaper columnist and close friend. He had driven to Bartlett's home in northwest Washington and dragged his friend on a walk, where he recounted a much d ifferent version of the meeting the night before. \"`As an American citizen he was outraged,' Bartlett recalled, \"to have a Zionist group come to him and say: 'We know your campaign is in trouble. We're willing to pay your bills if you'll let us have contro l of your Middle East policy.' Kennedy, as a presidential candidate, also resented the crudity with which he'd been approached. `They wanted control.' he angrily told Bartlett. \"Bartlett further recalled Kennedy promising to himself that `if he ever did ge t to be President, he was going to do something about it.'\" 70 — that is, special interest lobbies — particularly foreign pressure groups — dictating American election campaigns and foreign policy through their financial and political clout. PARTIALITY 'DANGERO US' In a private letter to Jewish American historian Alfred Lilienthal, himself a vocal critic of Israel, Kennedy did, however, reveal his feelings toward the Middle East conflict. The letter, written on September 30, 1960, read in part: \"I wholly agree w ith you that American partiality in the Arab - Israeli conflict is dangerous both to the U.S. and the Free World\" 71 In Lilienthal's judgment, Kennedy's comment was \"one of the most significant and perspicacious Middle East statements\" ever made by any Ameri can political figure. 72 But Kennedy had already cut his deals. Not only organized crime — but the Israeli lobby (of which Meyer Lansky was a critical supporter) — had their claims on John F. Kennedy. After the election, they expected Kennedy to pay up. In the general election, it was a narrow Kennedy victory over the Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon. The role of the Chicago Democratic political machine (under the thumb of Mafia boss Sam Giancana) in stealing Illinois votes on behalf of the Kennedy - Johnson ticket is now well known and a widely accepted part of American political history."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 No Love Lost [37] Sam Giancana and his allies in organized crime — including Meyer Lansky and the Israeli lobby — were confident that they had themselves a president. KENNEDY & BEN - GURION — THE FIRST ENCOUNTER Shortly after his inauguration as president, Kennedy arranged to meet with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion. At this meeting, Kennedy said, \"I know I was elected because of the votes of American Jews. I owe them my election. Tell me, is there something that I can do for the Jewish people?\" According to Seymour Hersh, \"Ben - Gurion was surprised by the frankness and evaded the question by answering, 'You must do what is best for the free world.\"' However, Ben - Gurion's r eal reaction to Kennedy was somewhat different. “What a politician!\" is how the Israeli leader described the American leader. 73 It was the beginning of a bitter and unpleasant relationship between the two men that came to its finish in Dallas, Texas on No vember 22, 1963. (In Chapter 5 we will examine that unfortunate relationship in detail.) KENNEDY TURNS THE TABLES It was not much longer afterward that Kennedy's organized crime friends began to realize that Kennedy was not proving to be the loyal ally t hat they had expected he would be. Soon after JFK assumed the presidency, an unexpected war on organized crime began. Robert Kennedy, who had cut his teeth prosecuting mobsters as a counsel for the Senate's \"rackets committee,\" was named attorney general and it was apparent that he was taking his new job seriously. According to Sam Giancana, \"It's a brilliant move on Joe [Kennedy]'s part. He'll have Bobby wipe us out to cover their own dirty tracks and it'll all be done in the name of the Kennedy 'war on o rganized crime.' Brilliant. Just fuckin' brilliant.\" 74 Meyer Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, reflected in later years upon the Organized Crime - Kennedy alliance and what it meant, particularly after Bobby Kennedy launched his campaign against t he underworld. \"I know that certain people in the Chicago organization knew that they had to get John Kennedy in. There was no thought that they were going to get the best of it with John Kennedy. See, there may be different guys running for an office, and none of them may be . . . what's best for a combination. \"The choice becomes the best of what you've got going. John Kennedy was the best of the selection. But nobody in my line of work had an idea that he was going to name Bobby Kennedy attorney general. That was the last thing anyone thought.\" 75"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"[38] Final Judgment 99 (In Chapter 13 and Chapter 14 we shall examine Cohen's own strange and critical role in the JFK assassination conspiracy and its ultimate cover up — yet another piece of the puzzle brought together in these page s.) Ultimately, as we shall see, JFK's war against his former allies in the underworld, would lead him to the very doorsteps of the real brains behind the national — and international — crime syndicate, Meyer Lansky. However, he had already double - crossed his immediate underworld collaborators. That alone was enough to spell JFK's doom. JFK MOVES AGAINST THE ISRAELI LOBBY However, Kennedy was also engaged in some legislative sleight - of - hand that could also prove dangerous to Israel's political leverage in Ame rican election politics. Angry at his campaign experiences with the Israeli lobby's fundraisers, Kennedy appointed a bipartisan commission in 1961 to recommend ways to broaden \"the financial base of our presidential campaigns.\" 76 According to Seymour Hers h, \"In a statement that was far more heartfelt than the public or the press could perceive, [Kennedy] criticized the current method of financing campaigns as 'highly undesirable' and 'not healthy' because it made candidates `dependent on large financial co ntributions of those with special interests.'\" 77 In 1962 Kennedy submitted five bills to reform campaign financing to Congress and in 1963 two more such bills. But none of those bills survived, having been beaten back by the very special interests that Ke nnedy sought to counter. 78 SECRET WARS However, Kennedy was more deeply engaged with Israel than on this more subtle level. As we shall see in Chapter 5, Kennedy, in fact, was at war with Israel. Not only had Kennedy double - crossed his allies in organi zed crime, but he had crossed his pro - Israel financiers. Israel, as we shall see in Chapter 7, was long close to the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. And Israel, as we shall see in Chapter 8, was particularly close to the American CIA. Kennedy, too, by the middle of his presidency, was also at war with the CIA. This we shall discuss in Chapter 9. All of these powerful special interests had very special reasons to want to see JFK removed from the presidency and replaced with Lyndon Johnson. There was clearly no love lost between John F. Kennedy and the powerful forces which had helped bring him to the presidency. A reform - minded President Kennedy also had other long - range plans in the works. The scion of an independent and essentially self - made man who \"played the game\" to gain power and influence — and to get his son elected president — JFK was indeed very much his father's son. As a consequence, in"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"[39] No Love Lost 100 another important realm, JFK was moving in a direction that could rock the international banking establish ment to its core. There have been widespread rumors, for nearly a generation, that JFK was planning to issue interest - free money — so - called \"greenbacks\" — independent of the stranglehold of the privately - owned Federal Reserve System. In fact, interest - free Un ited States Notes were issued during JFK's presidency — some remain in private hands today — but there have been many myths about what some have called \"JFK's Greenbacks\" and in Appendix Five we will examine this controversy in detail. THE MONEY MONOPOLY The re is no question, however, but that JFK — once firmly established in the presidency — fully intended to move against the Federal Reserve money monopoly. In fact, during his private meeting with DeWest Hooker, described earlier in these pages, JFK's father, Am bassador Joseph P. Kennedy assured Hooker that an ultimate long - term aim of the Kennedy dynasty would be the destruction of what the senior Kennedy described as \"the Rothschild - dominated Federal Reserve.\" This alone could have assured JFK's removal from th e White House. However, there were other more immediate and ultimately dangerous conflicts at work between the forces whose influence JFK sought to dismantle and the hard - driving new Kennedy administration. DIVERSE ENTITIES Let us move forward and examin e the strange and intimate connections between all of these Kennedy foes and the dynamics at work between them. However, as we shall see, it is the central thread of Israel and its Mossad that ties all of these diverse entities together. To begin the proce ss of untangling this hidden web of intrigue, we must first review the long - hidden story of Israel's secret war with John F.

One of John F. Kennedy's first presidential appointments was naming his former campaign aide Myer (Mike) Feldman as his point man for Jewish and Israeli affairs — an important post, especially considering JFK's tenuous relationship wi th Israel and its American lobby. According to author Seymour Hersh, \"The President viewed Feldman, whose strong support for Israel was widely known, as a necessary evil whose highly visible White House position was a political debt that had to be paid.\" 7 9 However, the administration was determined to make certain, according to Hersh, that nobody — Feldman in particular — would be able to circumvent any administration policy insofar as the Middle East was concerned. \"The President's most senior advisors, most acutely McGeorge Bundy, the national security advisor, desperately sought to cut Feldman out of the flow of Middle East paperwork.\" 80 Hersh quotes another presidential aide as having said, \"It was hard to tell the difference between what Feldman said and what the Israeli ambassador said.\" 81 'ZIONISTS IN THE CABINET ROOM' President Kennedy himself had his own suspicions about Feldman, according to the president's close friend, Charles Bartlett (to whom Kennedy in 1960 had previously voiced concern s about Israeli influence as noted in Chapter 4). Bartlett recalls a visit with the new President at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts one Saturday (the Jewish Sabbath). Talk turned to Feldman's role in the White House bureaucracy. \"I imagine Mike's having a meeting of the Zionists in the cabinet room,\" the president said, according to Bartlett. 82"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102 Genesis [41] The President's brother, Robert Kennedy, himself said that his brother admired Feldman's work, but added, \"His major interest was Israel rather than the United States.\" 83 However, while Myer Feldman was busy promoting Israel's interests at the White House, the president was sending out a message to the rest of the foreign policy - making establishment in Washington. Kennedy was making it clear that he was v ery much interested in finding a path to peace in the Middle East and was, in particular, looking for ways to solve the problem of finding a home for the Palestinian refugees who had been displaced by Israel in 1948. KENNEDY'S GOOD INTENTIONS A ccording t o Hersh, \"State Department Arabists were pleasantly surprised early in 1961 to get word from the White House, according to [one source], that 'just because 90 percent of the Jewish vote had gone for Kennedy, it didn't mean he was in their pocket.'\" 84 Forme r high - ranking U.S. diplomat Richard H. Curtiss, writing in A Changing Image: American Perceptions of the Arab - Israeli Dispute, elaborated on Kennedy's attitude toward the Middle East controversy. In a chapter appropriately titled: \"President Kennedy and G ood Intentions Deferred Too Long,\" Curtiss comments: \"It is surprising to realize, with the benefit of hindsight, that from the time Kennedy entered office as the narrowly - elected candidate of a party heavily dependent upon Jewish support, he was planning to take a whole new look at U.S. Mideast policy. \"He obviously could not turn the clock back and undo the work of President Truman, his Democratic predecessor, in making the establishment of Israel possible. Nor, perhaps, would he have wanted to. \"Kennedy was determined, however, to develop good new personal relationships with individual Arab leaders, including those with whom the previous administration's relations had deteriorated. \"As a result, various leaders of newly independent countries were surprise d to find their pro forma messages of congratulations upon Kennedy's assumption of office answered with personalized letters from the young American President.\" 85 OLIVE BRANCH TO NASSER The key Arab leader at the time was Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, the voice of Pan - Arabism. Kennedy was especially intrigued with the possibility of opening up relations with Nasser. According to Kennedy associate, Theodore Sorensen, \"Nasser liked Kennedy's Ambassador, John Badeau, and he liked Kennedy's practice of persona l correspondence. Kennedy put off, however, an invitation for a Nasser visit until improved relations could enable him to answer the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"[42] Final Judgment 103 political attacks such a visit would bring from voters more sympathetic to Israel.\" 86 (Unfortunately, however, as noted by Richard Curtiss, \"As with most good intentions deferred, the invitation to Nasser for a personal meeting with Kennedy was never issued.\" 87 ) Thus, it was that upon assuming office, Kennedy made positive attempts to contact Arab heads of state asking how the U.S. could help each country in its individual disputes with Israel. STANDING BY TRADITION However, Kennedy wanted one thing in particular understood by all sides in the conflict: the new U.S. president wanted \"to make it crystal clear that the U.S. meant what it said in the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 — that we will act promptly and decisively against any nation in the Middle East which attacks its neighbor.\" 88 This policy was directed not only to the Arabs, but Israel as well. Kennedy did indeed mean business. ISRAEL'S LOBBY REACTS Soon after Kennedy assumed office, Israel and its American lobby began to understand the import of Kennedy's positioning in regard to the Arab - Israeli conflict. Israel was not happy — to say the very least — and began put ting heat on the White House through the egis of its supporters in Congress, many of whom relied upon support from the Israeli lobby for campaign contributions and political leverage. According to America's most noted longtime Jewish critic of Israel, Dr. Alfred Lilienthal: \"While the President, more often through Vice President Lyndon Johnson, gave much lip service to Israelist aspirations, his administration continued to resist pressures, including a round - robin petition signed by 226 Congressmen of both parties (aided by a large New York Times advertisement on May 28, 1962) to initiate direct Arab - Israeli negotiations. Kennedy had decided to shelve his pledge in the Democratic platform to bring Israeli and Arab leaders together around a peace table in ord er to settle the Palestine question.\" 89 ALGERIA, AGAIN It was mid - way into Kennedy's presidency that he had the satisfaction of seeing French President Charles DeGaulle grant independence to Algeria — something, of course, as we saw in Chapter 4 that was not looked favorably upon by Israel and its American lobby. Five years and one day after Kennedy's Senate speech calling for Algerian independence, Algeria became a sovereign state on July 3, 1962. According to former diplomat Richard Curtiss, \"Algeria's [ revolutionary] leaders had not forgotten the American senator who had championed their cause and they publicly hailed his election.\" 90"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 Genesis [43] \"Kennedy in turn sent William Porter, the U.S. Foreign Service officer who had explained to him the Algerian cause, as the first U.S. Ambassador to Algeria. [Algerian leader] Ahmad Ben Bella visited Washington the same year. Afterward, in the words of Ambassador Porter, Ben Bella 'ascribed to Kennedy everything he thought good in the United States.'\" 91 Although pro - Isr ael propagandists and some American conservatives with close ties to the Israeli lobby said that an independent Algeria would be a \"communist\" outpost in the Middle East, Algerian Premier Ahmed Ben Bella banned the Communist Party of Algeria on November 29 , 1962. 92 In fact, Algeria was very much an Islamic state and it was precisely this which created so much concern for Israel . DeGAULLE'S MIDDLE EAST TURN - ABOUT However, the debate over Algerian independence had sparked a major crisis within France and the French Secret Army Organization (OAS), which fought Algerian freedom, considered John F. Kennedy an enemy only second to Charles DeGaulle. (In subsequent chapters, in greater detail, we shall see further how JFK's CIA enemies were, in fact, collabo rating with DeGaulle's enemies in the OAS, and traitors within his regime — along with the Israeli Mossad.) Twenty years after Algerian independence, the Washington Post commented on the effect that Algerian freedom had upon DeGaulle's Middle East policy and , in turn, upon Israel: \"Diplomatically, France shorn of Algeria, returned under president Charles DeGaulle to its traditional policy of friendship with the Arabs — much to the chagrin of Israel and the 200,000 Algerian Jews who had lived peacefully alongsid e their Arab neighbors until emigrating to France.\" 93 Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi notes that \"when Algeria, finally independent, joined the United Nations, only Israel voted against its admission.\" 94 In fact, as we shall see, the Algeria n question would ultimately play a part in the events that led to JFK's assassination. At the same time, JFK was shaping a Middle East policy that put him at loggerheads with Israel. Yet, cognizant of Israel's political influence in the United States, JFK made overtures to Israel and arranged to meet in Palm Beach, in December of 1962, with Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir. `A TWO - WAY STREET' It was during that meeting that Kennedy actually went so far as to emphasize American support for Israel, proba bly the farthest that any American president had gone since Israel was first established. However, the president tempered that pledge with a hope that Israel recognized that America also had interests in the Middle East. According to"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"[44] Final Judgment 105 President Kennedy, r eferring to U.S. - Israeli relations, \"Our relationship is a two - way street.\" 95 NO 'EXCLUSIVE FRIENDS' Phillips Talbot, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, who was present at the Kennedy - Meir conference prepared a memorandum for the Sta te Department summarizing that meeting. According to the memorandum, summarized by Stephen Green in his monumental study, Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations With a Militant Israel: \"The United States, the President said, has a special relationship wi th Israel in the Middle East really comparable only to that which it has with Britain over a wide range of world affairs. But for us to play properly the role we are called upon to play, we cannot afford the luxury of identifying Israel, or Pakistan, or ce rtain other countries, as our exclusive friends.\" 96 According to Green, the thrust of Kennedy's message to Israel was this: \"The best way for the United States to effectively serve Israel's national security interests, Kennedy said, was to maintain and de velop America's associations with the other nations of the region. [America's] influence could then be brought to bear as needed in particular disputes to ensure that Israel's essential interests were not compromised.\" 97 \"'If we pulled out of the Arab Mid dle East and maintained our ties only with Israel this would not be in Israel's interest,' Kennedy said.\" 98 FOUR PROBLEMS WITH ISRAEL The American President cited four areas causing a strain in U.S. - Israel relations: 1) Israel's diversion — from the Arab States — of the Jordan River waters; 2) Israel's retaliatory raids against Arab forces in border areas; 3) Israel's pivotal role in the Palestinian refugee problem; and 4) Israel's insistence that the United States sell advanced Hawk missiles to Israel. 99 T he President outlined to Mrs. Meir what has come to be called the Kennedy Doctrine. Kennedy told Meir that U.S. interests and Israel's interests were not always the same. The Talbot memorandum described Kennedy's forthright stance: \"We know,\" [said Kennedy ] \"that Israel faces enormous security problems, but we do too. We came almost to a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union last spring and again recently in Cuba . . . Because we have taken on wide security responsibilities we always have the potential of becoming involved in a major crisis not of our own making . . . AMERICA'S NEEDS IMPORTANT \"Our security problems are, therefore, just as great as Israel's. We have to concern ourself with the whole Middle East. We would like Israeli recognition that this partnership which we have with it produces strains for the United States in the Middle East . . . when Israel takes such action as it"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 Genesis [45] did last spring [when Israel launched a raid into Syria, resulting in a condemnation by the UN Security Council]. W hether right or wrong, those actions involve not just Israel but also the United States.\" 100 AMERICA — NOT ISRAEL — FIRST Stephen Green believes that Kennedy's position vis - à - vis Israel was an important stand: \"It was a remarkable exchange, and the last tim e for many, many years in which an American president precisely distinguished for the government of Israel the differences between U.S. and Israeli national security interests.\" 101 Thus it was that John F. Kennedy informed Israel, in no uncertain terms, t hat he intended — first and foremost — to place America's interests — not Israel's interests — at the center of U.S. Middle East policy. NUCLEAR EXPANSION This set the groundwork for further tension between the U.S. and Israel over an even more explosive issue: Israel's determination to build a nuclear bomb. Israel had been engaged in nuclear development during the past decade but continued to insist that its nuclear programs were strictly peaceful in nature. However, the facts prove otherwise. In order to thorou ghly examine Kennedy's conflict with Israel over the Zionist State's nuclear intentions, we once again refer to Stephen Green's aforementioned work, Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations With a Militant Israel, a treasure trove of little known informati on relating to U.S. - Israeli relations from the period of 1948 through 1967. Green writes of JFK's discovery that Israel was engaged in nuclear arms development. When Kennedy was coming into office in the transition period in December 1960 the Eisenhower ad ministration informed Kennedy of Israel's secret nuclear weapons development at a site in the desert known as Dimona. Israel had advanced several cover stories to explain its activities at Dimona. A 'HIGHLY DISTRESSING' SITUATION Israel had kept the nucl ear weapons program as secret as possible, but US intelligence had discovered the project. Kennedy termed the situation \"highly distressing.” 102 Kennedy, upon taking office, determined that he would make efforts to derail Israel's nuclear weapons developme nt. Nuclear proliferation was to be one of Kennedy's primary concerns. Israel's intended entry into the nuclear arena was, as a consequence, a frightening prospect in JFK's mind, particularly in light of ongoing conflict in the Middle East. From the very b eginning of his presidency, John F. Kennedy found himself at severe odds with the government of Israel. It was a conflict that"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"[46] Final Judgment 107 would never really be resolved until the day JFK died in Dallas. It was not an auspicious start for the New Frontier. K ENNEDY 'NO T AM USED' AND DE GAULL E ' ANNO YED' According to Stephen Green: \"The next year - 1961 — was to be an important one in the process of the nuclearization of the Middle East. In January, [Israeli Prime Minister] David Ben - Gurion informed the Israeli Knesset and the rest of the world that the Dimona reactor was in fact not a textile plant or a pumping station, but 'a scientific institute for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna.' A new American president, John Kennedy, was not amused.\" 10 3 In Paris, Charles DeGaulle's reaction mirrored that of Kennedy's. His government had been providing nuclear technology assistance to Israel, but with the assurance from Ben - Gurion that the nuclear development was peaceful in nature. According to Israeli historians Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman: \"There was also pressure from President DeGaulle in Paris. The French attitude toward the Middle East began to change just after he took office in 1958 . . . He suspected that the Dimona reactor was destined for milit ary uses and this greatly annoyed the French president.\" 104 (DeGaulle's later decision to grant Algerian independence, already described, simply exacerbated his own already growing tensions with Israel.) In Washington, JFK was determined to settle the mat ter once and for all. Stephen Green described Kennedy's next step: \"In May Kennedy and Ben - Gurion met in New York at the Waldorf - Astoria Hotel. Kennedy had already written to Ben - Gurion expressing his extreme concern about the Dimona project, and suggestin g regular inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In New York, Ben - Gurion agreed to a compromise — (approximately) annual inspections by U.S. scientists at times and on terms to be determined by the Israeli Defense Ministry. \"Later, Myer Feldm an, Kennedy's aide for Middle East matters, would reveal that in return for the periodic U.S. inspections, Ben - Gurion had exacted a promise of provision of advanced Hawk ground - to - air missiles. \"There is no reason to doubt Kennedy's seriousness in wanting to track Israeli nuclear research and forestall weapons development, but whether annual inspections under the terms indicated achieved this result [was, as events unfolded] open to question.\" 105 So it was that John F. Kennedy unintentionally found himsel f already at loggerheads with Israel behind the scenes. THE SECRET WAR Kennedy's friendly overtures to the Arab states were only a public aspect of what ultimately developed into an all - out 'secret war' between Kennedy and Israel."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 Genesis [47] According to Seymour Hersh: \"Israel's bomb, and what to do about it, became a White House fixation, part of the secret presidential agenda that would remain hidden for the next thirty years.\" 106 As Hersh notes, quite profoundly we see in retrospect, this secret war with Israel was never once noted by any of Kennedy's biographers. 107 If indeed it had been, as we shall see, the mystery behind the JFK assassination might have been unraveled long, long ago. ISRAEL'S NUCLEAR AGENDA There was an added wrinkle. Although Israel and t he American CIA had established a longtime close and ongoing working relationship, the CIA was monitoring Israel's nuclear weapons development. In March, 1963, Sherman Kent, the Chairman of the Board of National Estimates at the CIA, wrote an extended memo randum to the CIA's Director on the highly controversial subject entitled \"Consequences of Israeli Acquisition of Nuclear Capability.\" According to Stephen Green, for the purposes of this internal memorandum, Kent defined \"acquisition\" by Israel as either (a) a detonation of a nuclear device with or without the possession of actual nuclear weapons, or (b) an announcement by Israel that it possessed nuclear weapons, even without testing. Kent's primary conclusion was that an Israeli bomb would cause 'substan tial damage to the U.S. and Western position in the Arab world.' 108 According to Green's accurate assessment, \"The memorandum was very strong and decidedly negative in its conclusions\" 109 which were as follows: \"Even though Israel already enjoys a clea r military superiority over its Arab adversaries, singly or combined, acquisition of a nuclear capability would greatly enhance Israel's sense of security. In this circumstance, some Israelis might be inclined to adopt a moderate and conciliatory posture . . . \"We believe it much more likely, however, that Israel's policy toward its neighbors would become more rather than less tough. [Israel would] seek to exploit the psychological advantages of its nuclear capability to intimidate the Arabs and to prevent them from making trouble on the frontiers. \" 110 In dealing with the United States, the CIA analyst estimated, a nuclear Israel would \"make the most of the almost inevitable Arab tendency to look to the Soviet Bloc for assistance against the added Israel th reat, arguing that in terms of both strength and reliability Israel was clearly the only worthwhile friend of the U.S. in the area. \"Israel,” in Kent's analysis, \"would use all the means at its command to persuade the U.S. to acquiesce in, and even to supp ort, its possession of nuclear capability.\" 111 In short, Israel would use its immense political power — especially through its lobby in Washington — to force the United States to accede to Israel's nuclear intentions."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"[48] Final Judgment 109 However, the CIA did not make known its concerns about Israel's determination to produce a nuclear bomb. According to Green, \"It is perhaps significant that the memorandum was not drafted as a formal national intelligence estimate (NIE), which would have involved distribution to several other ag encies of the government. No formal NIE was issued by CIA on the Israeli nuclear weapons program until 1968.\" 112 That the CIA — or at the very least, elements within the CIA — would be interested in protecting Israel's interests is no surprise. As we shall see in Chapter 8, the ties between Israel and the CIA were quite intimate — perhaps too intimate in too many, many ways. KENNEDY AND BEN - GURION In the meantime, President Kennedy was well aware that Israel's nuclear project at Dimona would enable Israel to pr oduce at least one bomb per year — and that was enough to start a world war. Although Israel's nuclear program was ostensibly \"peaceful\" in nature, the fact is that the project was entirely controlled by Israel's Ministry of Defense. This alone made the proj ect controversial, even in Israel. It was for this reason that it was critical for Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion to neutralize JFK's opposition. There was enough domestic opposition to the program in Israel itself that Kennedy's own steadfast ref usal to support Israeli nuclear development could have killed the project altogether. In the early months of his administration, Kennedy maintained regular contact with Ben - Gurion in an effort to stop the nuclear development. The two leaders had an ongoing private correspondence over the issue. A POISONED RELATIONSHIP According to Seymour Hersh, \"Israel's bomb program, and the continuing exchange of letters about it, would complicate, and eventually poison, Kennedy's relationship with David Ben - Gurion.\" 1 13 Ben - Gurion sought to have a private meeting with Kennedy — in the course of an official state visit to Washington — but the president refused to provide a formal invitation. It was then that, in May 1961, Ben - Gurion pulled his strings at the White House and contrived a meeting with Kennedy through the intervention of New York financier Abe Feinberg. It was Feinberg, as we have seen in Chapter 4, who had initially smoothed over Kennedy's relations with the American Jewish community during the 1960 presidentia l campaign and arranged for a massive infusion of Jewish money into JFK's campaign. (It was this experience, as noted previously, that soured Kennedy's attitude toward Israel and its powerful lobby to a significant extent.) Feinberg arranged for the Americ an president and the Israeli leader to meet during Ben - Gurion's unofficial visit to the United States where he was"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 Genesis [49] scheduled to be honored at a convocation at Brandeis University, a Jewish - oriented center of learning near Boston. Following the affair at Brandeis, Ben - Gurion journeyed to New York City where he met with Kennedy at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. According to Hersh, \"The meeting with Kennedy was a major disappointment for the Israeli prime minister, and not only because of the nuclear issue. \" 114 \"'He looked to me like a twenty - five - year - old boy,' Ben - Gurion later told his biographer. 'I asked myself: 'How can a man so young be elected President?' At first I did not take him seriously.'\" 115 HATRED Following the meeting, Ben - Gurion complained to Feinberg about his unhappy first meeting with JFK. It was not an auspicious start, and as we shall see, it set a trend. According to Feinberg, \"There's no way of describing the relationship between Jack Kennedy and Ben - Gurion because there's no way B.G. wa s dealing with JFK as an equal, at least as far as B.G. was concerned. He had the typical attitude of an old - fashioned Jew toward the young. He disrespected [Kennedy] as a youth.\" 116 What's more, the Israeli Prime Minister had an additional reason to be s uspicious of the young American's motives. According to Feinberg, \"B.G. could be vicious, and he had such a hatred of the old man.\" 117 The \"old man\" in this case was the president's father, former Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, long considered not only an \"anti - Semite\" but a Hitler partisan. Ben - Gurion's contempt for the younger Kennedy was growing by leaps and bounds — almost pathologically. According to Hersh, \"The Israeli prime minister, in subsequent private communications to the White House, began to ref er to the President as 'young man.' Kennedy made clear to associates that he found the letters to be offensive.\" 118 Kennedy himself told his close friend, Charles Bartlett, that he was getting fed up with the fact that the Israeli \"sons of bitches lie to m e constantly about their nuclear capability.\" 119 Obviously, to say the very least, there was no love lost between the two leaders. The U.S. - Israeli relationship was at an ever - growing and disastrous impasse, although virtually nothing was known about this to the American public at the time. 'A MORE SERIOUS DANGER' President Kennedy's efforts to resolve the problem of the Palestinian refugees also met with fierce and bitter resistance by Ben - Gurion. The Israeli leader refused to agree to a Kennedy proposal that the Palestinians either be permitted to return to their homes in Israel or to be compensated by Israel and resettled in the Arab countries or elsewhere. Former Undersecretary of State George Ball notes in his book, The Passionate Attachment, that \"In the fall of 1962, Ben - Gurion conveyed his"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"[50] Final Judgment 111 own views in a letter to the Israeli ambassador in Washington, intended to be circulated among Jewish American leaders, in which he stated: 'Israel will regard this plan as a more serious danger to her existence than all the threats of the Arab dictators and Kings, than all the Arab armies, than all of Nasser's missiles and his Soviet MIGs . . . Israel will fight against this implementation down to the last man.\" 120 Clearly, then, by this point, Ben - Gurion percei ved the American president's policies to be a very threat to Israel's survival. Ben - Gurion was vowing to fight, as we have seen, \"down to the last man.\" KENNEDY'S GESTURE Despite all of this, the American president remained determined to find a solution to the potential crisis presented by Ben - Gurion's obstinacy. Kennedy offered to sell Israel Hawk missiles for defensive purposes — as Israel had been demanding — but Kennedy continued to drag his feet on the sale. The president refused to be pushed to the limi t by Israel. Kennedy finally relented and approved the sale, but only after pressure from Israel and its allies in the American Congress. By then, however, it was probably too late. The twig had been bent. ISRAEL RELENTLESS Even the arms sales to Israel did not assuage Israel and its lobby. According to Alfred Lilienthal: \"Congress continued to maintain pressures on the White House. The \"Israel first\" bloc in the Senate attacked the administration for failing to conclude a defense pact to protect Israel a nd to call an embargo on all arms shipments to the Middle East. \"The legislators reechoed the Ben - Gurion contention that Israel had fallen behind in the arms race. Nasser, they claimed, was ready for a push button war. Israel [was] easy to pinpoint and des troy and [could not] retaliate against four or five Arab states at once.\" 121 By this time — behind the scenes — Kennedy had ordered continuing surveillance of the Israelis and their push for the nuclear bomb. It was a top priority for Kennedy, by all estimatio ns. However, to ensure that Israel's access to intelligence regarding the American spy operation against Israel was limited, the surveillance was being conducted directly out of then - CIA Director John McCone's office. 122 (This, of course, still did not gu arantee that Israel's friends in the CIA [whom we will consider in Chapter 8] did not tip off the Israelis to the hostile operations being conducted.) Kennedy was still willing, however, to attempt to settle the matter and requested that Israel permit Amer ican inspectors the opportunity to come to Israel's nuclear operation at Dimona to verify that — as Israel claimed — the program was peaceful in nature. This was the president's last - ditch effort, apparently, to pacify Israel and, at the same time, find out pr ecisely what was going on at Dimona. But Israel would not permit the inspection."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 Genesis [51] By this time there was a general understanding at the highest ranks of the Kennedy administration that there was a major problem at hand. The president's inner circle had be gun to realize that Israel deemed Kennedy's refusal to knuckle under to Israel's demands as a dire threat to Israel's survival. According to then - Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, speaking in retrospect, \"I can understand why Israel wanted a nuclear bo mb. There is a basic problem there. The existence of Israel has been a question mark in history, and that's the essential issue.\" 123 The Israelis — and particularly Ben - Gurion — would no doubt agree. In their view, John F. Kennedy himself was emerging as a thr eat to Israel's very existence: JFK would simply not countenance a nuclear Israel and Israel's leaders believed that a nuclear Israel would ensure the continued survival of the Jewish State. THREATS AGAINST JFK The American president continued to demand that Israel permit American inspection of Israel's nuclear development facilities. In response, Israel called on its American lobby to apply pressure on Kennedy behind the scenes. One of those called into action was Abe Feinberg, the New York businessman w ho had helped raise critical funds for Kennedy during his presidential campaign. However, even Feinberg was unsuccessful. 124 However, Feinberg did send a message to the president that continued demands for inspection of the plant might \"result in less supp ort [from the Israeli lobby] in the 1964 presidential campaign.\" 125 According to Hersh, \"In the end Feinberg and Ben - Gurion could not overcome the continued presidential pressure for inspection of Dimona. Ben - Gurion's categorical public denial of any weapo ns intent at Dimona had left the Israeli government few options: refusing access would undercut the government's credibility and also lend credence to the newly emerging anti - nuclear community inside Israel. 126 DESERT DECEPTION So it was that Ben - Gurio n finally agreed to allow American nuclear experts to come to Dimona. However, Ben - Gurion had a clever trick up his sleeve. The Israeli Prime Minister hurriedly ordered the construction of what amounted to a phony nuclear plant — one that didn't give evidenc e of the construction of a nuclear bomb. False control rooms were set in place and dummy operations were displayed. It was all very carefully orchestrated. Even the Israeli guides who took the Americans through the facility were accompanied by translators who gave the Americans fraudulent translations of the remarks made by the Israeli engineers at the plant."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"[52] Final Judgment 113 According to Hersh, \"Ben - Gurion took no chances: the American inspectors — most of them experts in nuclear reprocessing — would be provided with a Potem kin Village and never know it.\" 127 Ben - Gurion's deception — however successful it may have been — still did not convince JFK that Israel was indeed fully committed to peaceful nuclear development. Kennedy, of course, knew better. A standoff between Kennedy and Israel was already in place and it did not bode well for the future. THE 'LAST AMERICAN PRESIDENT' John Hadden, the former CIA station chief in Tel Aviv at the time believes that John F. Kennedy was the last American president to have really tried to st op the advent of the Israeli atomic bomb. \"Kennedy really wanted to stop it,\" said Hadden, \"and he offered them conventional weapons [for example, the Hawk missiles] as an inducement. \"But the Israelis were way ahead of us. They saw that if we were going t o offer them arms to go easy on the bomb, once they had it, we were going to send them a lot more, for fear that they would use it.\" 128 `THE TURBULENT YEAR' By the fateful year of 1963, John F. Kennedy and Israel were decidedly on two different sides, an d not only in the realm of the secret — and critical — nuclear controversy. In fact, it went much deeper than that. Overall Kennedy administration policy toward the Middle East left Israel and its American lobby most dissatisfied. In his memoirs, I. L. Kenan o f the pro - Israel American - Israel Public Affairs Committee, a registered lobby for Israel, described 1963 as “the turbulent year\" between John F. Kennedy and Israel. In a chapter in those memoirs, entitled \"A Multitude of Promises\" — Kennedy presumably the pr omiser — Kenan scored Kennedy's Middle East policies: \"Kennedy's neutralist strategy, his hope to please both sides in every troubled area, plunged him into a multitude of predicaments in the turbulent year of 1963. His pursuit of former enemies whom he soug ht to befriend alarmed our allies, whose fears he constantly sought to ally by strong but quiet commitments.\" 129 The \"enemies\" whom Kenan referred to were those Arab leaders — Nasser of Egypt most especially — to whom JFK offered peace. Those \"allies\" — at leas t in Kenan's context — really meant just one country — Kenan's foreign principal, Israel. Kennedy's \"strong but quiet commitments,\" however, were apparently not enough as relations between Israel and the Arab states were strained. War appeared imminent, at lea st in the eyes of the Israeli leadership. By the end of April, 1963 Israel's David Ben - Gurion sensed that the Arabs were going to attack the Jewish State, but John F. Kennedy did not"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Genesis [53] share that pessimistic view. Kennedy still hoped for peace in the regio n and he continued his efforts. 13 0 THE ALGERIAN PROBLEM Although then - Senator John F. Kennedy's 1957 speech calling for independence for Algeria from France had helped pave the way for that end result, newly - won Algerian freedom came at great cost. Israe l was actively seeking to undermine the new regime. On August 14, 1963 the government of Algerian premier Ben Bella accused Israel of plotting to topple the new Arab regime. The Algerian authorities captured 20 Algerians and 10 foreigners who were engaged in a conspiracy to bring down the government. \"Those foreigners are nearly all Israelites,\" declared the Algerian information minister. \"We are led to believe that we are facing a plot with far - flung ramifications and that behind it is the hand of Israel w hich is trying to oppose the march of our revolution. \"Ben Bella has made clear the Algerian position on the enclave of imperialism called Israel but which is really Palestine. It is not strange that they are trying to interfere in our internal affairs.\" 1 31 Israel and its allies in the French Secret Army Organization (OAS) — now officially disbanded, but effectively still functioning — were determined to reverse the course of history. This, however, is not the last time in these pages that we will find the fin e hand of Israel and the OAS interfering in the life and work of John F. Kennedy. THE LAST PRESS CONFERENCE Kennedy's efforts to conduct a balanced U.S. Middle East policy were being frustrated at each and every turn. The bitterness was apparent — on both sides. As a result of Israel's manipulation of Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate voted in late 1963 to cut off aid to Egypt, a country central to Kennedy's drive for peace. This, in effect, temporarily — at least — scuttled JFK's peace efforts. His hand of friendship to the Arab world and its leaders, Nasser of Egypt in particular, was being cut off — at the shoulder. Israel's chief (registered) lobbyist in Washington — I. L. Kenan — described John F. Kennedy's final Washington press conferen ce. \"Kennedy ruefully surveyed the debris of his Nasser policy at a press conference on November 14, 1963. He was sharply critical. The Senate amendment required him \"to make a finding which is extremely complicated,\" and he did not believe that this langu age would strengthen our hand or our flexibility in dealing with the UAR. \"[Kennedy] went on: 'In fact, it would have an opposite effect. I think it's a very dangerous, untidy world, but we're going to have to live with it; and I think one of the ways to l ive with it is to permit us to function.'"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"[54] Final Judgment 115 \"If the Administration did not function, the voters would throw it out. Kennedy asked Congress not to make it impossible to function by means of `legislative restraints and inadequate appropriations.' \"These word s,\" Kenan notes, \"were uttered at his last White House press conference.\" 132 On many fronts, indeed, JFK's Middle East policy was angering the Israelis, including — perhaps especially — JFK's determination to solve the problem of the Palestinian refugees. J FK'S 'GOOD FAITH' IN DOUBT On November 20, 1963, Kennedy's delegation at the United Nations called for continuing movement toward the implementation of the 1948 UN resolution which called for the right of displaced Palestinian Arabs to return to their hom es (in Israel) and for those who chose not to return to their homes to be compensated. The London Jewish Chronicle reported the reaction of the Israelis: \"Prime Minister Levi Eshkol summoned the U.S. ambassador . . . and told him that Israel was 'shocked' by the pro - Arab attitude adopted by the U.S. delegation.\" Golda Meir, the Chronicle reported, \"expressed Israel's `astonishment and anger' at the attitude of the U.S.\" 133 For its own part, the Chronicle noted editorially, \"Israel, which has neither bee n consulted nor informed about the American intention, is not surprisingly questioning the good faith of the United States.\" 134 It is not likely that JFK ever got to read the defamatory comments about his Middle East policy published by the London Jewish Chronicle. They were printed on November 22, 1963. So it was that even as John F. Kennedy was preparing to leave Washington for his final journey as president, he was plagued with the problem of Israel and its powerful influence in Washington. As it turned out, it was during Kennedy's trip to Dallas that one last memorandum was prepared on his behalf relating to the touchy issue of global nuclear arms development. Although JFK had forcefully opposed French production of nuclear weapons — much as he opposed th at of Israel — the American president had, however, begun taking a new look at his stance vis - à - vis the French. Thus it was that while John F. Kennedy was triumphantly touring downtown Dallas, there was being prepared a \"Top Secret, Eyes Only\" memorandum fro m JFK's advisor, McGeorge Bundy, outlining the new, perhaps more lenient, Kennedy policy toward France, which, as we have seen, had itself played a major role in Israel's nuclear development and, unwittingly (much to the disgust of French President DeGaull e) in the drive for atomic weaponry. The memorandum regarding the new policy toward France was also dated November 22, 1963. 135 By this time, however, John F. Kennedy's fate was sealed. He had p ushed Israel and its leaders to the brink."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 Genesis [55] BEN - GURION: 'SIG NS OF PARANOIA' The straw that broke the camel's back, had actually taken place some six months earlier. By spring of 1963, Kennedy and Ben - Gurion were at loggerheads, more seriously than ever before. What's more, Ben - Gurion was suffering a deep personal crisis (part of which, we now see, stemmed from his unhappy relationship with John F. Kennedy). According to the Israeli prime minister's biographer, Dan Kurzman: \"Lonely and depressed, Ben - Gurion felt strangely helpless. Leadership of Israel was slipping from his withered hands . . . Ben - Gurion began to show signs of paranoia. Enemies were closing in on him from all sides. A mere declaration by Egypt, Syria and Iraq in April 1963 that they would unite and demolish the \"Zionist threat\" threw him into near - p anic.\" 136 SECRET CORRESPONDENCE 'INCREASINGLY SOUR' All of this, of course, contributed immensely to the problems between Kennedy and Ben - Gurion. Seymour Hersh writes: \"Kennedy's relationship with Ben - Gurion remained at an impasse over Dimona, and the c orrespondence between the two became increasingly sour. None of those letters has been made public.\" 137 KENNEDY A 'BULLY' (Like much of the secret government files on the JFK assassination, the Kennedy exchanges with Ben - Gurion also have not been releas ed — not even to U.S. government officials with full security clearances who have attempted to write classified histories of the period.) 138 \"It was not a friendly exchange,\" according to Ben - Gurion's writer, Yuval Neeman. \"Kennedy was writing like a bully. It was brutal.\" 139 Ben - Gurion' s response was not passive either. All of this exacerbated tensions — fierce tensions — between the American President and the Israeli leader. Kennedy's impatience was building. Relations between the United States and Israel wer e unlike they had ever been before. According to Hersh, \"The president made sure that the Israeli prime minister paid for his defiance.” 140 When Ben - Gurion once again sought the opportunity for a formal, ballyhooed state visit to Washington, Kennedy rebuf fed him. ISRAEL'S 'EXISTENCE IS IN DANGER' It was then that Ben - Gurion made his position all too clear. He was convinced that what he perceived to be Kennedy's intransigence was an all - out threat to the continued survival of the Jewish State. JFK was per ceived as an enemy of the Jewish people."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"[56] Final Judgment 117 In one of his final communications with Kennedy, Ben - Gurion wrote: \"Mr. President, my people have the right to exist . . . and this existence is in danger.\" 141 (emphasis added) It was at this time that Ben - Gurion demanded that Kennedy sign a security treaty with Israel. Kennedy refused. On June 16, 1963 Ben - Gurion abruptly resigned as prime minister and defense minister. Thus, the \"prophet of fire\" ended his fifteen - year career as grand old man of Israel. At the t ime, the Israeli press — and indeed the world press — told the world that Ben - Gurion's sudden resignation was a result of his dissatisfaction with domestic political scandals and turmoil that were rocking Israel. 142 A BITTER IMPASSE However, the primary reas on behind Ben - Gurion's departure was the Israeli leader's inability to pressure JFK into accepting Israel's demands. According to Hersh: \"There was no way for the Israeli public . . . to suspect that there was yet another factor in Ben - Gurion's demise: his increasingly bitter impasse with Kennedy over a nuclear - armed Israel.\" 143 Ben - Gurion had failed. The battle had been lost, but the war between the two men was still to be won. A MODERN - DAY HAMAN? What was on Ben - Gurion's mind as he turned over the rein s of government to his successor? What was David Ben - Gurion's final act as Prime Minister of the Jewish State? In light of Ben - Gurion's explicit comment to John F. Kennedy that \"my people have the right to exist . . and this existence is in danger,\" we can certainly make a good presumption. In Ben - Gurion's eyes, John F. Kennedy was clearly a modern - day Haman — an enemy of the Jewish people. In Jewish folklore, Haman was a descendant of the Amalekites who served as prime minister to King Ahasueros of Persia. I t was Haman who sought to convince the king that all of the Jews of his empire should be exterminated forever. However, according to legend, a beautiful Jewish temptress named Esther used her feminine wiles on Ahasueros and, in the end, it was Haman who wa s instead put to death. The important Jewish holiday of Purim celebrates the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's intended holocaust. In the Bible — Deut 25:19, I Sam. 15:8 — the ancient Hebrews were urged to \"blot out the memory of the Amalekites\" from whom H aman descended. In Israel — in 1963 — David Ben - Gurion certainly looked upon John F. Kennedy as a modern - day Haman, a son of the Amalekites. As he pondered the brutal conflict with JFK, Ben - Gurion no doubt remembered the meditation that is read on Purim: \"A wi cked man, an arrogant offshoot of the seed of Amalek, rose up against us. Insolent in his riches, he digged himself a pit, and his own greatness laid him a snare. In his mind he thought to entrap, but was"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 Genesis [57] himself entrapped; he sought to destroy, but was h imself speedily destroyed . . . he made him a gallows, and was himself hanged thereon.\" A FINAL ORDER? The Israeli leader could not help but ponder further how he might deliver his people from what he perceived to be certain destruction. Ben - Gurion had d evoted a lifetime creating a Jewish State and guiding it into the world arena. And, in Ben - Gurion's eyes, John F. Kennedy was an enemy of the Jewish people and of his beloved state of Israel. Andrew and Leslie Cockburn have summarized it well: \"Ben - Gurion is the father of Israel. He really steered the state to independence, steered his people to independence, wrote the Israeli declaration of independence, was prime minister all the way through, with a brief interval, until 1963. The Israel you see today is really the creation of David Ben - Gurion.\" 144 We can thus see why Ben - Gurion was indeed so frustrated by his failure to back down John F. Kennedy. It was a time of crisis and a time for action. It is the thesis of this volume that Ben - Gurion, in his final d ays as Prime Minister, ordered the Mossad to participate in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Based upon evidence that we will outline in Final Judgment, we believe that the Mossad carried out Ben - Gurion's order. On November 22, 1963, the American presiden t whom Ben - Gurion considered a threat to Israel's very survival came to an inglorious end in Dealey Plaza in Dallas. That Israel and its leaders believed that drastic measures might be needed to influence the course of history and to ensure the survival of Israel cannot be doubted. Isser Harrel, who was head of the Mossad until mid - 1963, has been quoted as saying that \"The government of Israel must act to root out the evil of racism and the monster of anti - Semitism . .\" and that if it could not be done dipl omatically, it was to be done in other ways, including, according to Harel, \"the secret services, as was the case in my times.\" 145 In short, by means of murder, if necessary. Former Undersecretary of State George Ball summarizes the impact of John F. Kenn edy's assassination on U.S. - Israeli relations quite succinctly, if somewhat cryptically: \"However Kennedy would have succeeded in his relations with Israel must remain one of the many intriguing questions for which his assassination precludes any answer.\" 146 A MOSSAD HIT SQUAD We know precisely who would have coordinated Mossad participation in the assassination on John F. Kennedy, working in concert with Israel's allies in the CIA and in Organized Crime (about more of which we shall discuss in these pag es.) Israel's respected Ha'aretz newspaper reported on July 3, 1992 that it was former Jewish underground terrorist - turned - Mossad operative Yitzhak"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"[58] Final Judgment 119 Shamir (later Israeli Prime Minister) who headed a special Mossad hit squad during his service in the Moss ad. The Israeli newspaper reported that Shamir headed the assassination unit from 1955 until 1964 — the year after JFK' s assassination. \"The unit carried out attacks on perceived enemies and suspected Nazi War criminals,\" 147 according to an account of the n ewspaper's report. \"In February 1963 Mr. Shamir dispatched squads on two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Hans Kleinwachter, a German scientist suspected of helping Egypt develop missiles. Another German scientist working for the Egyptians, Heinz Krug, disappeared mysteriously in September 1962.\" 148 Shamir's operatives were suspected of having been responsible. According to the Israeli newspaper, Shamir had recruited members for his Mossad hit squad from former members of the Stern Gang, the underground terrorist group that Shamir led during Israel's fight for independence. The Stern Gang was responsible for the murder, in 1944, of Lord Moyne, Britain's resident Mideast minister, and for the slaying of U.N. mediator Count Folke Bernadotte in 1948. 149 We have already seen that Kennedy — like Moyne and Bernadotte — was a \"perceived enemy\" of Israel and its embittered Prime Minister, David Ben - Gurion. And now we know of the existence of the Mossad hit squad that played a major role in the conspiracy that brough t about the death of John F. Kennedy. In Chapter 16 we shall learn precisely how this Mossad - orchestrated conspiracy came about. THE ENEMIES COME TOGETHER With Israel's intimate ties to not only the American CIA but also the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate — which we will examine in much further detail — the Israeli prime minister and his Mossad operatives had in place a network of allies with whom they could easily collaborate in orchestrating the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Each of these powerf ul forces had good reason to take drastic action to put an end to the threat posed by JFK. That they undoubtedly came together in a joint conspiracy we shall document in this volume. THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH With John F. Kennedy lying in a grave in Arli ngton National Cemetery, Israel was safe — for the time being at least. The modern - day heir of Haman's legacy had been destroyed. That Lyndon Johnson — a man with a steadfast history of loyalty to Israel and its American lobby — was in line to assume the America n presidency was a fact not gone unnoticed.

This permitted Israel to advance its own geo - political stance in the Middle East; and 4) It enabled Israel's allies in the CIA a nd the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate to gain a lock on drug trafficking in Southeast Asia as a proximate result of U.S. involvement in the region.

ISRAEL'S SURVIVAL If protection of its national security interests and its very survival can be considered a motive — and surely it can be — then Israel, perhaps above all, obvious ly had a major interest — and motivation — in helping orchestrate the assassination of President Kennedy. Indeed, the very survival of Israel has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy from that nation's earliest beginnings. Thus, elimination of a perceived enemy to Israel's"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"[60] Final Judgment 121 survival — that is, John F. Kennedy — would only be a logical course of action. This especially, of course, in light of the fact that the man who succeeded Kennedy — Lyndon Johnson — had long and often proven a history of personal affinity for Israel and its international interests. JOHNSON'S LANSKY CONNECTION Johnson, too, had a long and sordid record of involvement in criminal activities — including murder — that have finally begun to surface. The record is far too complex to examine here — beside s which, popular literature on the subject is quite complete. Nonetheless, it is certainly worth noting that one major Johnson backer was Meyer Lansky's Louisiana henchman, Carlos Marcello. According to John W. Davis, Lansky's man Marcello funneled at leas t $50,000 a year in payoffs to then - Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson who, in turn, helped kill in committee all rackets - related legislation that might have been harmful to the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. 150 There are indications, however, that Johnson's ties to Lansky and his associates go even deeper. When Lansky himself was living in Israel, one of his American cronies, Benjamin Sigelbaum, came visiting. 151 It was Mr. Sigelbaum (not to be confused with Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel whom Lansky had ordered k illed in 1947) who was involved with longtime Johnson intimate Bobby Baker in two major dealings: the purchase of a bank in Tulsa, Oklahoma and in Baker's controversial Serv - U Vending Machine Company. 152 Another of Baker's business collaborators, was Edwar d Levinson, who operated the Fremont Casino in Las Vegas as a front man for longtime Lansky friend and business partner, Joseph (Doc) Stacher (who ultimately died in exile in Israel). 153 What's more, author Robert Morrow, a former CIA contract agent, has revealed that one of Baker's closest associates, with whom he was reportedly \"thick as thieves,\" was a mob courier named Mickey Weiner who was \"a complete user of [Baker's] office, of all the [Baker] facilities on [Capitol] Hill.\" 154 Needless to say, Bak er's office and Baker's \"facilities\" were one and the same with those of Lyndon B. Johnson. It was this same Mickey Weiner who, as we shall see in Chapter 7, was one of Meyer Lansky's chief couriers between his Miami banking operations and his European mon ey - laundering center at the Banque de Credit International (BCI) in Geneva, Switzerland. (BCI, as we shall see in detail in Chapter 7, Chapter 12 and Chapter 15, was operated by an Israeli banker, Tibor Rosenbaum, former Director for Finances and Supply fo r Israel's Mossad.) Mr. Baker, who served time in federal prison for his criminal activities during his time as Johnson's protégé (and as his reputed bagman), would have been the one person who could have sent Lyndon Johnson to prison if he had revealed al l."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 The Coming of the Messsiah [61] Indeed, it was Johnson's involvement with Bobby Baker that had led John F. Kennedy to begin laying the groundwork for dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in 1964. But even with Kennedy's death, the stench of corruption surrounding the Lansky - l inked Baker still threatened Johnson. JOHNSON FACES PRISON? Washington lobbyist Robert N. Winter - Berger recalls a visit by then - President Johnson to the office of House Speaker John McCormack while Winter - Berger was there. Johnson burst in unexpectedly. Unconscious of Winter - Berger's presence, Johnson began shrieking and shouting and condemning his longtime friend and protégé, Bobby Baker. \"John, that son of a bitch is going to ruin me. If that cocksucker talks, I'm gonna land in jail,\" Johnson roared. \"I practically raised that motherfucker and now he's gonna make me the first President of the United States to spend the last days of his life behind bars.\" 155 According to Winter - Berger Johnson suddenly realized that he was present. Speaker McCormack assur ed the president that Winter - Berger was \"all right\" and that Winter - Berger was close to one of Baker's other associates, Nat Voloshen. Johnson asked Winter - Berger to have this message relayed to Baker. \"Tell Nat to tell Bobby that I will give him a million dollars if he takes this rap. Bobby must not talk.\" 156 Baker did not talk. Baker went to jail. Johnson did not. Obviously, Johnson's Lansky connection is far more complex than we might even be able to determine — but the interplay between Johnson and his i ntimates and those of the Lansky syndicate is indisputable, to say the least. SUDDEN POLICY CHANGES Needless to say, when Lyndon Johnson became president, the Kennedy war against organized crime came to a sudden halt. There were other important policy reversals as well, including, of course, the change in Vietnam policy (about which we will explore further in this chapter and in Chapter 9.) What, of course, however, is most significant about Lyndon Johnson's assumption of the Oval Office were the profou nd — and immediate — changes in U.S. policy toward Israel and the Arab world that came rapidly upon LBJ's sudden succession to the presidency. `GOOD NEWS' FROM DALLAS The earliest evidence we can find that Israel and its lobby in America were delighted by Ly ndon's elevation to the presidency comes in a memo that I. L. Kenan, director of the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"[62] Final Judgment 123 (AIPAC) sent out to top - ranking figures in AIPAC and others in the Israel lobby in Washington. Hailing Johnson's \"front - rank pro - Israel position\" 157 during his Senate career, the memo was dated November 26, 1963, just one day after John F. Kennedy was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The memo, incidentally, was formally noted \"Not for Publication or Circulation.\" 158 Clearly, those in the Israeli camp didn't want their seeming delight in Kennedy's passing — and Johnson's sudden good luck — to be in the public record. What is additionally interesting are Kenan's memoirs of his service as one of the Israeli lobby's top men in Washing ton. The memoirs contain, as we have seen, a chapter about John F. Kennedy cryptically — perhaps critically — entitled — \"A Multitude of Promises\" along with the intriguing — and accurate — reference to 1963 as \"The Turbulent Year,\" (for U.S. - Israeli relations). 159 The very next chapter — about Lyndon Johnson — is warmly entitled \"Israel's Texas Friend.\" Johnson — who was, in Kenan's words, the \"New Man in the White House\" — proved to be a very loyal friend of Israel. Seymour Hersh points out that one of Johnson's first symb olic acts as president was to dedicate a synagogue in Austin, Texas — less than six weeks after assuming the presidency. In fact, Hersh notes, Johnson was the first American president in history to dedicate a synagogue. It was, we shall see, a very symbolic act indeed. 160 Lady Bird Johnson, the new president's wife, later tried to explain why her husband was so fond of Israel and its friends in the American pro - Israel lobby. \"Jews have been woven into the warp and woof of all his [Johnson's] years,\" she said . 161 ISRAEL'S INTERESTS FIRST In Israel, Johnson's presidency was greeted with pleasure. The Israeli newspaper Yedio Ahoronot said that in a Johnson presidency the issue of \"U.S. interests\" would not be as much of a problem in U.S. - Israeli relations as t hey had been under Kennedy. 162 In other words, Johnson — unlike Kennedy — would be willing to set aside American interests in favor of Israel's. The Israeli journal added, \"There is no doubt that, with the accession of Lyndon Johnson, we shall have more opport unity to approach the President directly if we should feel that U.S. policy militates against our vital interests.\" 163 MOURNING IN ISLAM In the Arab world, however, the response was far different. According to former diplomat Richard Curtiss, who spent much time in the region, \"The mourning stretched across the Arab world, where to this day faded photographs on humble walls depict the young hero.\" 164"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 The Coming of the Messiah [63] In Algeria, the new Arab republic that had achieved independence with help from John F. Kennedy, Prem ier Ahmad Ben Bella telephoned the U.S. ambassador to say, \"Believe me, I'd rather it had happened to me than to him.\" 165 Kennedy's friendly gestures for peace were being remembered. In Egypt President Nasser realized that the death of John F. Kennedy wou ld have a profound impact upon the Arab world. With Kennedy's departure, Nasser later said that \"[French President Charles] DeGaulle is the only Western Head of State on whose friendship the Arabs can depend.” 166 However, according to DeGaulle's biographe r, Jean Lacouture, DeGaulle was \"a friend neither of the Arabs, nor of Israel, but only of France.\" 167 One might say that similar words could likewise be applied to John F. Kennedy: \"a friend neither of the Arabs, nor of Israel, but only of America.” And Israel certainly did not consider JFK a friend. MOURNING IN PARIS In Paris, DeGaulle — who had granted Algerian independence and who had suffered numerous attempts on his own life in retaliation — was thoroughly stunned by the murder of the American presiden t. He interrupted a Cabinet meeting to announce: \"John Fitzgerald Kennedy has been assassinated. He was one of the very few leaders of whom it may be said that they are statesmen. He had courage and he loved his country. \"168 According to DeGaulle's biograp her, \"It was a tribute without precedent and one that was never repeated.\" 169 In fact, as we shall see, the very same elements that had conspired against the life of DeGaulle were indeed those same elements who had brought about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And if DeGaulle did not know it then, he ultimately would. SUSPICIONS There was additional fall - out in the Arab world as a consequence of Kennedy's assassination. According to Curtiss, the fact that Kennedy's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Osw ald was promptly murdered by Jack Ruby — in Curtiss' words — “an American Jew with gangster connections,\" 170 suspicions about Israel's complicity in the crime were widespread. According to Curtiss: \"The circumstances gave rise to many conspiracy theories, incl uding one believed by virtually all Arabs that the assassination was to prevent an impending U.S. policy change in the Middle East.\" 171 Curtiss' next comment, however, has proven wrong in the light of what we are about to explore in the pages of Final Judg ment: \"No Middle East connection of any sort has ever been discovered, however.\" 172 Curtiss notes that, \"Instead, ironically, the assassination five years later by an Arab - American in California of President Kennedy's younger brother, an outspoken supporte r of Israel, made Robert Kennedy the first American"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"[64] Final Judgment 125 victim of the Palestinian - Israeli dispute to be killed on U.S. soil.\" 173 (However, as we shall see in Chapter 18, there is — as in the assassination of John F. Kennedy — a lot more about the murder of his younger brother than really meets the eye.) Nonetheless, as Alfred Lilienthal, the veteran critic of U.S. Middle East policy, has written, \"There is little question that Kennedy intended to move decisively in his second term. The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, shattered the possibility that his second term might see Washington start to free itself from the grave burdens of U.S. partisanship on the Arab - Israeli conflict and of continuous politicking for domestic votes.\" 17 4 MOVING FAST Arab hopes for peace had been shattered and a new American president in Washington was — in the meantime — busy ingratiating himself with Israel's representatives in the American capital. “You have lost a very great friend, but you have fou nd a better one,” the new president told one Israeli official. 175 Although Johnson’s quote has been oft repeated, it is not quite certain just who that official was. The quote, indeed, may have been apocryphal — another legend in the Lyndon Johnson legacy. However, most sources believe that Johnson's comment was probably made to Ephraim Evron, the number two man in Israel's embassy in Washington. It was Evron who ultimately became a very close friend of Lyndon Johnson. At the time of the Kennedy assa ssination — interestingly enough — Evron was in Washington in charge of Israeli intelligence operations, working closely with James Jesus Angleton, Israel's man at the CIA. Thus, it seems likely, that whatever Angleton knew about JFK's assassination, Evron lik ely knew — and vice versa. And perhaps, we might speculate, Johnson also thus knew as well. (In Chapter 8 and in Chapter 16 we will consider Angleton's peculiar part in the JFK assassination conspiracy in full detail.) According to Johnson aide Harry McPhers on, \"I think [Evron] felt what I've always felt, that some place in Lyndon Johnson's blood there are a great many Jewish corpuscles.\" 176 The aforementioned McPherson, speaking on tape for the LBJ Library Oral History Project, interestingly described himse lf as the Johnson White House's \"staff anti - Semite,\" 177 McPherson explained that this meant that he had to maintain \"a continuing relationship with B'nai B'rith, the Anti - Defamation League, to some extent the Zionist organization, and others who want vari ous things,\" 178 presumably a difficult task. As a consequence, McPherson was especially tuned in to Johnson's relationship with Israel and its lobby in Washington."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126 The Coming of the Messiah [65] In fact, as the record shows, Johnson had a long and close relationship with Israel and i ts partisans. Israel knew that it had a loyal devotee of its interests in the White House now that John F. Kennedy was out of the way. A LONG - TIME FAVORITE OF ISRAEL Israel, of course, had been keeping a close watch on Lyndon Johnson for a long time. Abo ut Johnson, Israeli intelligence man Evron said as follows: \"Johnson's feeling about Israel came out very early in the [Suez] crisis in 1957 when he was [Senate] majority leader. When at that time President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles wanted t o force us to withdraw from Sinai, they threatened us with economic sanctions. Johnson persuaded Senator William Knowland of California, who was then minority leader, to come with him to the White House and tell the President that it just wouldn't do.\" 179 The Arab States were also watching Johnson closely, particularly after he assumed the presidency. Particularly concerned was Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser with whom JFK had hoped to build bridges. In fact, as we have seen, it was during his last Wh ite House press conference that JFK bemoaned the efforts by Israel and its partisans to sabotage his Middle East peace initiatives, especially in regard to relations with Nasser. THE CHANGE IN POLICY BEGINS According to author Stephen Green, as early as March 5, 1964 Nasser told Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Phillips Talbot that \"The U.S. had shifted its policy into more active support of Israel.\" 180 This was just little more than three months after John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and Lyndon B. Johnson was catapulted into the presidency. Nasser's assessment was on target. According to intelligence historian Richard Deacon, Johnson's new policy was keeping in line not only with Israel's demands, but those of Israel's friends at the CIA: \"Presiden t Johnson had already swung away from the tentative pro - Arab stance of the Kennedy administration which had always been frowned upon by the CIA.\" 181 Deacon reports that Walt Rostow, the president's national security advisor believed that US policy towards Israel would serve as an effective check on Soviet support for Arab countries. \"Thus,\" according to Deacon, \"Rostow reflected almost totally the views of the CIA hierarchy.\" 182 Johnson, himself, also had long - standing ties to Israel's friends in the CIA f rom his years of service in the Senate. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson worked closely with the CIA on a regular basis and was considered a \"CIA friend\" in Congress. Unquestionably, however, Lyndon Johnson did indeed begin a major shift in U.S. Middle E ast policy — keeping in line with his joint devotion to not only the CIA's interests, but those of Israel's as well."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"[66] Final Judgment 127 This, of course, had a momentous impact on the course of American foreign policy and was an immediate and absolute turn - about of the policy that had been pursued by the late President Kennedy. THE NUCLEAR BOMB Interestingly enough, Israel's initial primary benefit from the death of JFK was, in fact, the removal from the White House of a president who vehemently opposed Israel's nuclear weap ons development. According to historian Stephen Green: \"Perhaps the most significant development of 1963 for the Israeli nuclear weapons program, however, occurred on November 22 on a plane flying from Dallas to Washington, D.C., Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \"In the early years of the Johnson administration the Israeli nuclear weapons program was referred to in Washington as 'the delicate topic.' Lyndon Johnson 's White House saw no Dimona, heard no Dimona, and spoke no Dimona when the reactor went critical in early 1964.\" 183 Thus it was that the critical point of dispute between John F. Kennedy and the Mossad - dominated government of Israel was no longer an issue . The new American president — so long a partisan of Israel — allowed the nuclear development to continue. This was just the beginning. HUBERT HUMPHREY & THE LANSKY SYNDICATE Johnson was also cementing his long - standing ties to Meyer Lansky's Organized Crime Syndicate. In 1964 — seeking his first full term in the White House — Johnson selected Minnesota Senator Hubert H. Humphrey as his vice - presidential running mate. As the Washington Observer newsletter noted: \"Humphrey was first catapulted into public office a s Mayor of Minneapolis in 1945 via the machinations and campaign slush funds raised by the notorious Kid Cann, king of the Minneapolis underworld. \"Cann, whose real name was Isadore Blumenfeld, along with his brothers (who were known by their aliases, Harr y and Yiddy Bloom) were partners with Meyer Lansky in the ownership of many of the plush resorts in Miami, along with Humphrey's chief advisor, Max Kampelman, a top figure in the Israeli lobby in Washington.\" \"Blumenfeld and Lansky were partners in the syn dicate that owned the Sands and Fremont Hotels — gambling operations in Las Vegas — until they sold their interest in the Sands to Howard Hughes. When Humphrey and his top aides are in Miami,\" the Observer reported, \"they enjoy[ed] free accommodations at the s yndicate's plush hotels.\" 184 (Alan H. Ryskind, writing in his critical biography of Humphrey, demonstrated how then - Minneapolis Mayor Humphrey managed to look the other way when Blumenfeld got himself into a widely - publicized set of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 The Coming of the Messiah [67] difficulties 185 — just one of HRH's favors for the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. Thus, in the 1964 presidential election — which was Johnson's to lose — Lansky and his partners in Israel were assured a dream ticket come November. Both Johnson and his vice president were bo ught and paid for. Lansky and Israel made sure there wouldn't be any problems with any independent upstart second - generation multi - millionaire Irishmen like John F. Kennedy who was not only the son of a notorious anti - Semite but a bull - headed proponent of America's interests to boot. Thus, having become ensconced in the presidency, Lyndon Johnson was in a position to do many favors for Israel. THE FOREIGN AID PORK BARREL Perhaps his most drastic efforts in service to Israel involved massive increases in U .S. taxpayer - financed foreign aid giveaways. Although John F. Kennedy himself had been generous to Israel in that regard, Johnson made Kennedy look like a piker. Former Undersecretary of State George Ball comments that in the foreign aid realm: \"The Israel is were proved right in their assumption that Johnson would be more friendly than Kennedy.\" 186 According to author Stephen Green, citing U.S. Agency for International Development data: \"Over the next few years — the first three years of the Johnson administ ration — [the level of foreign aid] support [to Israel] would change both qualitatively and quantitatively. U.S. government assistance to Israel in FY 1964, the last budget year of the Kennedy administration, stood at $40 million. This was substantially redu ced from the levels of assistance in previous years. In FY 1965, this figure rose to $71 million, and in FY 1966, to $130 million.\" 187 ARMING ISRAEL'S WAR MACHINE Green notes further that under Lyndon Johnson, United States military aid to Israel also sa w a drastic increase: \"More significant, however, was the change in the composition of that assistance. In [JFK's] FY 1964, virtually none of the official U.S. assistance for Israel was military assistance; it was split almost equally between development l oans and food assistance under the PL 480 program. In [LBJ's} FY 1965, however, 20 percent of U.S. aid was military in nature, and in FY 1966, fully 71 percent of all official assistance to Israel came in the form of credits for purchase of military equipm ent. \"Moreover, the nature of the weapons systems we provided had changed. In FY 1963, the Kennedy administration agreed to sell five batteries of Hawk missiles valued at $21.5 million. This however was an air defense system. The Johnson administration, in FY 1965 - 1966, provided Israel with 250 modern (modified M - 48) tanks, 48 A - 1 Skyhawk attack aircraft, communications and electronics equipment, artillery, and recoilless rifles."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"[68] Final Judgment 129 Given the configuration of the [Israel Defense Forces], these were anything but defensive weapons. \"The $92 million in military assistance provided in FY 1966 was greater than the total of all official military aid provided to Israel cumulatively, in all the years going back to the foundation of that nation in 1948.\" 188 Green summ arizes the massive extent of Johnson's giveaways: \"Seventy percent of all U.S. official assistance to Israel has been military. America has given Israel over $17 billion in military aid since 1946, virtually all of which — over 99 percent — has been provided s ince 1965.\" 189 ISRAEL'S INTERESTS FIRST It was clearly Lyndon B. Johnson who set the precedent for unlimited aid to Israel. All told, however, the death of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson's assumption of the Oval Office marked a major change in overal l U.S. policy. As Stephen Green writes, in all too clarifying detail in Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations With A Militant Israel: \"In the years 1948 - 1963, America was perceived by all of the governments in the Middle East as a major power that acted upon the basis of its own, clearly defined national self - interest. Moreover, U.S. Middle East policy was just that — Middle East policy; it was not an Israeli policy in which Arab countries were subordinate actors. \"In the years 1948 - 1963, Presidents Truman , Eisenhower, and Kennedy firmly guaranteed Israeli national security and territorial integrity, but just as firmly guaranteed those of Jordan, Lebanon, and the other nations of the region. That was what the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 was all about. \"F or successive Israel governments in this period, the boundary line between U.S. and Israeli national security interests was drawn frequently, and usually decisively. Truman's policies on arms exports to the middle East, Eisenhower's stands on regional wate r development and on territorial integrity during the Suez Crisis, and Kennedy's candor with Mrs. Meir — all of these were markers on this boundary line. \"Nevertheless, during this time U.S. financial support for Israel far exceeded that given any other nati on in the world, on a per capita basis. And U.S. diplomatic support for Israel in the UN and elsewhere was no less generous. \"But the limits to U.S. support for Israel were generally understood by all of the countries of the region, and it was precisely th ese limits that preserved America's ability to mediate the various issues that composed the Arab - Israeli dispute. \"Then, in the early years of the Johnson administration, 1964 - 1967, U.S. policy on Middle Eastern matters abruptly changed. It would perhaps b e more accurate to say that it disintegrated. America had a public policy on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, but suddenly had a covert policy of abetting Israel's nuclear weapons program. We had a public policy on arms balance in the region, but s ecretly agreed, by the end of 1967, to become Israel's major arms supplier."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130 The Coming of the Messiah [69] \"Officially, the United States was \"firmly committed to the support of the political independence and territorial integrity of all the [Middle Eastern] nations,\" while conscious ly, covertly, the Johnson \"Middle East team\" set about enabling Israel to redraw to her advantage virtually every one of her borders with neighboring Arab states. \"It was, of course, a policy without principle, without integrity. But it was also ineffectiv e, in the sense that Israel steadily continued to act in ways that ignored U.S. national security interests.\" 190 VIETNAM — ISRAEL BENEFITS These incredible facts about the sudden reversal of traditional U.S. policy have gone too long ignored in the context of considering the question of who stood most to benefit by the assassination of John F. Kennedy.Israel clearly stood most to benefit — and did. All of this is most ironic when one considers the fact that Israel repeatedly and pointedly refused to support J ohnson's Vietnam policy, much to the dismay of \"Israel's Texas Friend.\" \"Dammit,\" Johnson once complained to his \"staff anti - Semite\" Harry McPherson, \"they want me to protect Israel, but they don't want me to do anything in Vietnam.\" 191 Clearly, Israel's allies in the CIA now had a free hand to conduct their own private war in Vietnam — one CIA benefit resulting from Kennedy's removal from the presidency. (In Chapter 9 we will examine Kennedy's war with the CIA in further detail.) Johnson's reversal of JFK's decision to begin withdrawing U.S. forces (and CIA personnel) from Southeast Asia was, in its own sense, a CIA coup. The CIA also expanded its own power during the Vietnam conflict. Likewise with Johnson's many friends in the defense industry both at home in Texas and elsewhere. The defense contractors reaped untold billions in profits from Johnson's dirty little war in Southeast Asia — a war that probably spelled the end of Johnson's popular chances for a second term. VIETNAM — ISRAEL'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET However, what has been unfortunately ignored is that Israel, too, had much to gain from U.S. involvement in Vietnam. As Stephen Green points out, a direct and proximate result of U.S. military adventurism in Southeast Asia was Israel's ability to advance i ts own military muscle and political influence in the Middle East. After all, Israel could now argue, with the United States bogged down in Southeast Asia, Uncle Sam needed its close, reliable, democratic ally in the Middle East looking out for America's i nterests in the region. According to Green: \"In a period in which the Johnson White House was becoming increasingly obsessed with the war in Vietnam, Israel's military leaders offered to impose stability upon the peoples and countries of the Middle East — it was to be a 'Pax Hebraeca.'"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"[70] Final Judgment 131 \"There were, of course, costs involved for America. The United States would have to take the initial steps toward becoming what three previous Presidents had said we never would be — Israel's major arms supplier. We would also at least temporarily forfeit our role as primary mediator of the multifaceted Arab - Israeli dispute. \"The new arrangement would necessitate throwing our long - standing nuclear nonproliferation treaty to the winds, the 1968 treaty to the contrary notwithstan ding. \"Perhaps most important, U.S. national security interests in the region would become merged with Israel's to a degree that was, and is to this day, unique in the history of U.S. foreign relations.\" 192 Israel — above all — stood to benefit immensely from U.S. involvement in Vietnam, something which would not have occurred had JFK lived. There is yet an additional irony in the relationship of the United States and Israel vis - à - vis the Vietnam conflict that is very much worth noting, After the war in Vietnam was underway, dragging Lyndon Johnson deeper and deeper into the muck of public discontent, Israel was beginning to encounter its own difficulties as it flexed its muscle in the Middle East. Although America's entry in Southeast Asia had given Israel a fr ee hand in its own sphere of geographic influence, the tiny Jewish state found that it now needed the United States — perhaps more so than ever. Israel's aggression against its Arab neighbors had rallied the Arab world against Israel. With the United States in too deep in Southeast Asia, Israel and its American lobby perceived U.S. energy to be focused in the wrong direction. Thus it was that many of the very voices urging U.S. withdrawal from the arena of Vietnam were those who were most stridently demanding that the U.S. re - insert itself into the Middle East cauldron. WHERE SHOULD AMERICA FIGHT? It was on the eve of the 1967 War — a war that could have been the end for Israel — that the Washington Star (in its June 4 lead editorial) pointed out the strange par adox. \"Many of those, both at home and abroad, who most loudly condemn the American presence in Vietnam, were the first to urge total American involvement in the Middle East. \"And having made the leap from isolation to intervention, they have gone on to ar gue that our commitment in the Middle East is additional justification for disengagement in Asia. The nation, so this line of reasoning goes, cannot afford involvement in both areas. \"A choice must be made. And the Middle East is the logical place for the United States to intervene,\" 193 according to the Star's assessment of the attitude of the pro - Israel advocates of withdrawal from Vietnam who were urging U.S. intervention in the Middle East. So it was that Israel, which initially reaped benefits from U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, ultimately began banging the drum for U.S."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"[71] The Coming of the Messiah 132 withdrawal — but it was only well after the damage of the Vietnam War had already been done. Israel was placing its own interests — not America's interests — first. LANSKY, THE CIA & V IETNAM It should be noted, too, that Israel's friends in the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate also stood to benefit from the Vietnam conflict. In Chapter 12 we shall examine in detail the little - known collaboration between the Lansky syndicate, its Mossad - linked banking money launderers, and the CIA in the drug pipeline out of Southeast Asia. T he Lansky crime empire began operating major global drug trafficking, largely under CIA cover, throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, during which t ime the drug problem began escalating to a major degree in the United States and elsewhere. Now, many years later, the CIA's role in the global drug market is only now just coming to the surface. The Iran - contra scandal, for example, shed some light on thi s little known aspect of the underbelly of world affairs. Thus, the joint Israel - Lansky - CIA combine shared a major benefit from American involvement in Vietnam. They had Lyndon Johnson to thank. A PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT Israel and its covert allies did in deed have a messiah in Lyndon Baines Johnson. In his book, The Passionate Attachment, former Undersecretary of State George Ball summarized the results of Johnson's Middle East policies: \"First, the administration put America in the position of being Israe l's principal arms supplier and sole unqualified backer. \"Second, by assuring the Israelis that the United States would always provide them with a military edge over the Arabs, Johnson guaranteed the escalation of an arms race . . . Third, by refusing to f ollow the advice of his aides that America make its delivery of nuclear - capable F - 4 Phantoms conditional on Israel's signing the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty, Johnson gave the Israelis the impression that America had no fundamental objection to Israel' s nuclear program. \"Fourth, by permitting a cover - up of Israel's attack on the Liberty [see Chapter 2], President Johnson told the Israelis in effect that nothing they did would induce American politicians to refuse their bidding. From that time forth, the Israelis began to act as if they had an inalienable right to American aid and backing.\" 194 As Stephen Green concluded in his discussion of the incredible changes in U.S. policy toward Israel that took place during the Johnson era: \"By June of 1967, for a variety of reasons that prominently included `domestic political considerations,' Lyndon Johnson and his team of foreign - policy advisors had completely revised U.S. - Israeli relations. To all intents and purposes, Israel had become the 51st state.” 195"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chap ter Seven Israel's Godfather: The M an in the M iddle M ey er La nsky , t he CIA, t he FB I & t he Isra eli M ossa d I f i t h a d n o t b e e n f o r i n t e r n a t i o n a l c r i m e b o s s M e y e r Lansky there mig ht no t be a state of Israel today.

Kennedy, as we saw in Chapter 4, had also double - crossed his se cret allies in the criminal underworld who had helped him achieve the presidency. The president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, was waging a relentless war against organized crime. In the years prior to Kennedy's ascendency to the presidency , a little - known, but immensely powerful underworld figure by the name of Meyer Lansky had schemed and shot his way to the top of the crime syndicate. That syndicate was not just national — it was international — and the uncrowned king of crime was Meyer Lansk y — the so - called \"chairman of the board\" of that incredible criminal empire which spanned the globe. It was Meyer Lansky, early in his criminal career, who had emerged as one of the leading sponsors of the state of Israel and whose most intimate associates were among the chief financial patrons of the influential Israeli lobby in America. What's more, as we shall see, Lansky had also forged close ties with Israel's allies in the American CIA — an agency that, in itself, had entered into a bitter war with John F. Kennedy. Thus, when JFK came to blows with not only Israel and its allies in the Lansky Organized Crime empire, but also with the CIA, the American president had unwittingly forged a deadly alliance among his fiercest foes."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 Israel’s Godfather [73] It is the Meyer Lansky conn ection which explains how Israel's Mossad was able to utilize and manipulate, among other elements, the anti - Castro Cuban community — itself working with not only the CIA but also the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate — in the conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. To begin our investigation of the shadowy crevices of the underworld where Israel's Mossad, Organized Crime and the CIA came together in the Kennedy murder, it is most appropriate to begin with Lansky. It is Lansky (individually) and his crime syn dicate which tie all of these diverse strands together, pointing the finger toward the until - now undisclosed role of Israel in the JFK assassination. A spokesman for the Bahamas Commission of Inquiry which was investigating organized crime in the islands, once said, \"At one stage, we began to wonder whether the name of Meyer Lansky was not some vast journalistic piece of fiction, so ghostly and mythical a figure did he appear.\" 196 But exist he did. Meyer Lansky, in fact, is a pivotal player in the interna tional conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of John F. Kennedy — all of the literature propagating the theor y that \"T he Mafia Killed JFK\" notwithstanding. WHO WAS MEYER LANSKY? The most concise summary of the origins and rise to power of Meyer Lan sky appeared in a lengthy profile of Lansky that appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 1969 . It reads, in pertinent part: \"Born Maier Suchowjansky in Grodno, Russia, Lansky arrived in the U.S. at age nine. His family settled in New York' s immigrant slums. By the time he was 27, young Maier had five arrests on his record, on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to suspicion of murder, but he was never convicted. He had begun his painstaking climb up the underworld ladder. \"It was during the 1920’s that Lansky became a pal and partner of Bugsy Siegel. The two became a formidable pair, first as hired gunmen for Legs Diamond, soon as leaders of their own gang, called the 'Bugs and Meyer Mob.' A MEMBER OF THE BOARD \"Their specialty was pro tecting liquor in transit from hijackers to East Coast gangs. They were good at it, and when an alliance called the Eastern Syndicate was formed to coordinate rum - running Lansky and Siegel were named to the board. Lansky was put in charge of handling the s yndicate's finances. \"By the early 1930’s, the Eastern syndicate began to form a loose alliance with other regional mobs. Thus was the national syndicate born. Each gang retained its own identity and pursued its own activities, with the federation coming t ogether occasionally to discuss matters of common"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"[74] Final Judgment 135 interest. Final decisions rested with individual gang leaders, with one acting as federation chairman. The first chairman was Lucky Luciano, head of the Mafia in the East. TIES TO U.S. INTELLIGENCE \"Dur ing World War II, Lansky played a part in an incredible alliance between the underworld and the U.S. Navy . . . Apparently, the Navy decided East Coast piers could be protected from sabotage only with the aid of the Mafia. \"Lucky Luciano was [by then in pr ison], but he still held power and the loyalty of Mafia members. Luciano's attorney and Meyer Lansky were recruited to persuade Luciano to give the arrangement his blessing. After several months of prison visits, Luciano agreed . . . After the war, Lucky w as paroled and sent home to Italy on promise he would never again enter the U.S. CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \"With Luciano gone, a triumvirate of Lansky, Joe Adonis and Frank Costello took over leadership of the syndicate. By the late 1950's, Costello had been ousted from power by his colleagues and Adonis had been deported. Lansky sat alone at the top.\" 197 In the meantime, Lansky had already cemented his ties with the Washington establishment. In fact, those ties were long - standing. LANSKY & CUBA (In Chapte r 10, we shall discuss Lansky's critical role in helping win President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932.) Roosevelt himself sent Lansky as a personal emissary to Cuba to meet with Cuban strongman Fulgencio Batista. F DR believed that Batista's authoritarian rule was stirring popular discontent which could be exploited by a growing communist movement in Cuba. Through Lansky FDR hoped to influence Batista to institute reforms that would quell the communist threat. It was during this period that Lansky had begun establishing his lucrative gambling empire in the tropical paradise and a long and profitable personal and business relationship with Batista and other Cuban leaders who made millions in kickbacks from Lansky's cas ino operations. (Among those on the receiving end of Lansky's pay - offs was Carlos Prio Soccaras, whom, we shall see in Chapter 14, ultimately became a business partner in gunrunning activities with Dallas nightclub operator and Lansky Syndicate henchman, J ack Ruby.) 198 (In Chapter 11, we shall examine Lansky's Cuban gambling activities and his Israeli Mossad - linked European money laundering operations. In"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 Israel’s Godfather [75] Chapter 12 we shall examine Lansky's international narcotics trafficking, and his consequent connect ions with the CIA, in detail.) Although Batista was in and out of office several times during the next two decades, the Cuban strongman remained the de facto leader of the island through successive puppet regimes until the advent of Fidel Castro on New Yea rs Day, 1960. However, Lansky also had extensive contacts much farther away from American shores. Lansky — as we shall see here — was a key force in establishing the State of Israel. ALLIANCE & RIVALRY To understand Lansky's preeminent leadership position in organized crime, however, we must first look at the strange and complex alliance — and rivalry — between the Italian and Jewish elements in the organized crime world. The Wall Street Journal's account of Lansky's rise to power hints at these contradictions, b ut doesn't explore them in the fashion needed. Two interesting things left out of the Journal summary of Lansky's career should be mentioned. It is generally known that Lansky launched his criminal career working in conjunction with the famed Mafia figure Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. Their alliance is noted in the Journal account and a recent Hollywood extravaganza entitled Mobsters highlighted the youthful exploits of Lansky, Luciano, Benjamin Siegel and Frank Costello. LUCIANO GETS FRAMED However, it may ha ve been Lansky, through his political contacts, who arranged the criminal indictment and subsequent imprisonment of Luciano. It was Luciano's imprisonment — and ultimate deportation — that smoothed Lansky's further advancement in organized crime. In his own me moirs Luciano provides a detailed account of how he was, in fact, framed on the white slavery and prostitution charges that resulted in his imprisonment. Luciano does not blame Lansky, by any means, although, as we shall see, he may have had his suspicions . Luciano doesn't ask the reader to believe that he (Luciano) wasn't engaged in extensive criminal activity. He does present a very cogent case, however, that he was not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted. Indeed, Luciano was never brought to trial for any of the crimes in which he was engaged with Lansky. In any case, it is quite possible that Lansky, in fact, did have some role in framing Luciano on the prostitution charges. Tom Dewey's war against Lucky Luciano, the Mafia chieftain's impriso nment, and his subsequent deportation smoothed the way for Lansky's rise to the top."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"[76] Final Judgment 137 It was upon Luciano's deportation, that Luciano actually named Lansky as his official spokesman. According to Luciano, \"I worked it all out with Lansky, and that's the p oint where Meyer became the real treasurer of the outfit. I put him in charge of my money and later on he started to take care of the finances of quite a few guys.\" 199 Lansky was — despite his Jewish origins — the capo di tuti capi (\"boss of all bosses\") in L uciano's absence. Theoretically, Lansky could never be a \"member\" of the Mafia, but he certainly ranked higher than even \"made\" members who had been inducted into the so - called \"honored society.\" LANSKY, DEWEY & THE CIA Both Dewey and Lansky did, of cour se, stand to benefit from Luciano's imprisonment. The case of Dewey and his Lansky connection is most interesting. As a consequence of his prosecution of Luciano, Dewey won widespread political fame and in 1938 ran, unsuccessfully, for governor of New York . In fact, at that time, Lansky reportedly donated fully $250,000 (in 1938 dollars) to Dewey's campaign. Dewey did not win that race, but during the remaining period of his service as New York's \"racket - busting\" prosecutor he did obtain a conviction of one of Lansky's Jewish rivals in organized crime, Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter, who eventually died in the electric chair. T h e n , i n 1 9 4 2 w h e n D e w e y o n c e a g a i n — t h i s t i m e , successfully — sought the governorship, Lansky provided additional financial support and politic al muscle. Dewey, as governor, commuted Luciano's sentence. In return for his freedom, Luciano agreed to go into exile to his homeland of Italy. Thus, Lansky's influence widened in Luciano's absence abroad. This would not be, however, the end of the Dewey - Lansky relationship. Dewey later became a major stockholder in the Mary Carter Paint Company in the late 1950's. According to former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow, \"Carter Paint was originally an active corporation set up by Thomas Dewey [and CIA direct or] Allen Dulles to use as a CIA front. In 1958, Dewey and some friends had bought controlling interest in the Crosby Miller Corporation, with two million dollars in CIA money — authorized by Allen Dulles. Then, in 1959, the Crosby Miller Corporation was mer ged with the CIA - owned paint company. As an example of one of its early activities, it provided laundered CIA money for the Bay of Pigs army. In 1963, Mary Carter Paint spun off its paint division, after a Florida land scandal, and became Resorts Internati onal.” 200 Resorts International, Inc. controlled virtually all of the resorts in the Bahamas and throughout the Caribbean where Lansky reorganized his gambling operations after being forced out of Cuba in 1960."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138 Israel’s Godfather [77] Resorts International ultimately set up a subsidiary known as International Intelligence, Inc. (Intertel) ostensibly designed to curtail organized crime involvement in the casino industry. However, in reality, this was a myth. There are those who suspect that Intertel — like Resorts International an d Mary Carter Paint before it — was not simply a CIA operation, but a joint CIA - Lansky operation — an intelligence network interacting with Israel's Mossad. 201 Perhaps not surprisingly, Dewey's admiring biographer, Richard Norton Smith, wr iting in Thomas E. D ewe y and His Times, never mentions Dewey's Mary Carter Paint Company — or Lansky's support for Dewey's political endeavors. Another Lansky connection gone unmentioned. All of this illustrates the depth of Lansky's political influence and his wide range of co nnections. FRANK COSTELLO 'RETIRES' There is also the question as to whether Lansky may have had a hand in the unsuccessful assassination attempt against his other boyhood friend, the aforementioned Frank Costello, who was often called \"the Prime Ministe r of the Mafia.\" Whatever the truth, the attempt on Costello forced the \"prime minister\" into early retirement and gave Lansky further influence in organized crime. LUCIANO REMEMBERS . . . \"Lucky\" Luciano, who had initially smoothed Meyer Lansky's way to the top, later rued the day that he had placed so much trust in his early gangland associate. In 1961, well after his influence in the international crime syndicate had begun to dwindle, Luciano reflected upon his relationship with Lansky. \"In [Shakespear e's] Julius Caesar, you remember a guy by the name of Cassius? He was a pain in the ass. It seems like everybody's got a Cassius in his life.\" According to Luciano, his Mafia associate Vito Genovese was his own Cassius. However, upon further thought he add ed, \"Come to think of it, I even had two Cassiuses in my life, the other one bein' a guy by the name of Meyer Lansky. But I didn't get on to him for a long time.\" 202 In his waning days Luciano considered offers from Hollywood producers who wanted to film his life story. However, Luciano — in exile in Italy — got word from home that there were \"orders\" that he not participate in any such venture. It was then that Luciano saw the whole picture — the whole truth about what \"the Mafia\" had really become. 'THE BOSS OF EVERYTHING' \"When I realized that Meyer Lansky was right in the middle of this, that's when I knew he had us all by a string. Why should Lansky, bein' a"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"[78] Final Judgment 139 Jew, give a shit whether or not some fuckin' movie had a bunch of Italian names in it? Because h e was pullin' the wires and everybody was dancin' to his tune on the other end, like a bunch of puppets. \"Lansky held the purse strings, too; he was the treasurer and he was really tryin' to be the boss of everythin'. He was so hungry for power behind the scenes he'd kiss anybody's ass and do anythin' he had to do so that in the end, he — Meyer Lansky, my old partner and a Jew — would wind up the real boss of bosses of all the Italians and the Jews — and without a single fuckin' vote on the [organized crime syndi cate] council. \"I never really knew what it meant when we was kids and I used to call him the Genius. But at the age of sixty - four, I finally got wise.\" 203 THE GUIDING HAND So it was that Meyer Lansky — though not an Italian — did, indeed, become, as he was to be called, \"the chairman of the board\" of the organized crime syndicate, even more powerful than the \"Mafia\" itself. If, as some claim, \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" it couldn't have been done without the foreknowledge — and guiding hand — of Meyer Lansky. And a s we shall see in this chapter — and further throughout the pages of this work — Lansky's connections with Israel and its Mossad (as well as Israel's allies in the CIA), demonstrates that Israeli loyalist Meyer Lansky is an integral player who bound together t he diverse elements which came together in the JFK assassination conspiracy. HIDING BEHIND 'THE MAFIA' In Little Man, his recent friendly biography of Meyer Lansky, Robert Lacey dismissed rumors of Lansky's role in the JFK assassination when he wrote tha t: \"Meyer was mentioned most frequently of all in that happiest of hunting grounds for conspiracy theorists, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.” 204 This is the only reference in Lacey's book to even the most tenuous link between Lansky and th e JFK murder. However, as we shall see, the connections are very deep indeed. Yet, contrary to what Lacey contends, Lansky's name seldom appears in any significant fashion in most standard accounts which contend that organized crime played a role in the as sassination. The fact is that Lansky's name has been continuously and conveniently buried behind a host of Italian Organized Crime (\"Mafia\") figures. In Chapter 10 and Chapter 11 we review, extensively, Lansky's connections with the more famous — perhaps inf amous — Italian - surnamed underworld figures linked to the Kennedy assassination. As we shall see, in fact, those individuals in question were, practically to a man, Lansky's underlings. However, Lansky's name is hardly mentioned at all in standard accounts w hich suggest that organized crime — particularly \"the Mafia\" — played a part in the president's murder."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140 Israel’s Godfather [79] `THE REAL LEADERS OF CRIME' Lansky's most authoritative biographer, organized crime writer Hank Messick pinpoints the tendency of the media — and the law enforcement community — to overlook the broad and penetrating reach of the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate, focusing instead on the media's hype of \"the Mafia\" — the Italian wing of the criminal underworld. Says Messick: \"The real leaders of crime have remained hidden while the nation's law enforcement agencies have chased minor punks. And naive is he who believes this development is accidental. Research reveals that non - Mafia leaders of crime have been hiding behind the vendetta - ridden society [the Ital ian Mafia] for decades. . . Attempts to frame me have been made, and I've been smeared as anti - Semitic from coast to coast by gangsters who used religion as a cloak.\" 205 In his own memoirs, Lansky's crony, Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano revealed one rather inte resting fact. According to Luciano, it was Lansky himself who suggested that the newly - assembled national crime syndicate dub itself \"the Union Siciliano\" — a sobriquet which gave the criminal underworld a decidedly \"Sicilian\" imagery. 206 `KOSHER NOSTRA' According to veteran JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott, \"It is relevant that [then - Senate rackets committee counsel Robert F.] Kennedy did not use the word 'Mafia' when presenting, in his 1960 book The Enemy Within, his model of organized crim e as an endemic, multi - ethnic, partially institutionalized syndicate.\" 207 According to Scott: \"What Robert Kennedy had meant by the `syndicate' was very different from what [Mafia experts meant by the term] La Cosa Nostra.\" 208 According to Scott, \"anyone speaking about organized crime . . . does so under conditions of great political restraint.\" 209 To put it bluntly: the term \"Mafia\" does not account for the substantial — and indeed predominant — role of Meyer Lansky and his Jewish associates in the national crime syndicate. Because of political constraints and fear of being accused of \"anti - Semitism,\" many have been afraid to point out the important role of Jewish criminals in the world of crime. One Jewish gangster, Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen , discussed the Italian - Jewish conflict in organized crime in his memoirs. He said, frankly: \"See, I don't want to pull any wool over anybody's eyes because I'm writing a true autobiography, right? And I certainly don't want to mince any words, but I reall y don't consider the Mafia or anything of that type the only strength [in organized crime].” 210"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"[80] Final Judgment 141 Cohen differentiated between the Italian elements in organized crime, popularly known as \"the Mafia\" and \"La Cosa Nostra\" and the Jewish forces sometimes sat irically called, \"the Kosher Nostra.\" \"It's an organization. It's more what I would refer to as a syndicate.. . So it was an organization, but it wasn't the Mafia. Being Jews, Benny and me and even Meyer couldn't be a real part and parcel of that [the Mafi a].\" 211 (The \"Benny\" to whom Cohen referred was the aforementioned Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, the lifelong friend and crime partner of Lansky's. It was Lansky who ultimately ordered Siegel's assassination. (We will learn much more about the Lansky - Siegel - Coh en connection in Chapter 13 where we uncover Cohen's own pivotal role in the JFK assassination conspiracy.) It was not, in fact, until the infamous Mafia conclave at Appalachian, New York, in 1957 when the media began hyping \"the Mafia\" as a major force in organized crime. Americans had long been aware of legendary mobsters such as Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, but general awareness that a national crime syndicate did indeed exist was not commonplace. Following a police raid of the Appalachian conference — att ended exclusively by top Italian - surnamed Mafia figures from around the country — public attention began focusing on \"the Mafia\" — thanks to the media. MAFIA IN TURMOIL/LANSKY ON TOP The official story has always been that a local policeman just happened to stumble upon the Mafia conclave at the home of Mafia figure Joseph Barbara. He called in reinforcements and a major \"bust\" took place. However, according to Hank Messick, the police had been tipped off by a Lansky associate that the meeting was about to t ake place. Messick described the consequences of the Appalachian raid : \"The delegates were scattered before any alliance could be reached. And the publicity caused the greatest heat since the 1930's. It focused not only on the men who attended the session but on the entire Mafia. What's more, it continued for well over a year as state and federal officials tried to find some charge to stick against the delegates they had captured or identified. \"Not only were Mafia leaders immobilized by the continuing pub licity, but also they were demoralized. Almost instinctively they rallied to Lansky and other non - Mafia syndicate leaders for advice and assistance.\" 212 Perhaps not coincidentally, one of the young attorneys who played a key role in the Appalachian raid w as one Justin Finger. It was Finger who later went on to become chief of the \"civil rights division\" of the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the primary intelligence and propaganda arm of Israel's Mossad in the United States. 213 In subsequent chapt ers, Chapter 17 in particular, we will examine the role of the ADL in the JFK assassination cover - up in more explicit detail."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 Israel’s Godfather [81] Obviously, the Appalachian raid was a critical event in Lansky's continuing rise to power. It solidified Lansky's hold over the crime syndicate. Michael Milan, a low - level Jewish organized crime figure who grew up in Lansky's sphere of influence claims to have, in fact, been ritually inducted into the Mafia — by Lansky himself. It was to Lansky that Milan swore his allegiance. Writin g in his memoirs, Milan remembers the event fondly: “` Omerta' whispered Meyer Lansky, only half believing in the ritual itself, but not wanting to show the slightest sign of disrespect to . . . [Mafia] traditions.\" 214 In any case, as we have seen, Meyer Lansky's predominant role in the criminal underworld was already well in place. T H E H O O V E R - L A N S K Y C O N N E C T I O N Lansky's role in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - Naval Intelligence operations during World War II and his work on behalf of Frankli n Delano Roosevelt in handling Batista may account for the fact that Lansky seldom faced harassment from the federal authorities. Writing in Secret File, Hank Messick comments: \"Was Lansky rewarded? No final answer is possible, but he has been strangely im mune to prosecution on the Federal level. Twice the IRS Intelligence Division has recommended prosecution, and twice the Justice Department has declined. Lansky remains the only top man in the national crime syndicate to escape untouched. Because of his br ains and the troubles of his colleagues, he rules as undisputed chairman of the board.\" 215 Lansky himself acknowledged his role in the so - called \"Operation Underworld.\" \"Sure, I'm the one who put Lucky and Naval Intelligence together,\" he told his Israeli friend, Israeli newsman Uri Dan. Lansky's reasons were interesting: \"The reason I cooperated was because of strong personal feelings. I wanted the Nazis beaten. I was a Jew and I felt for those Jews in Europe who were suffering. They were my brothers.\" 216 Former Lansky associate (and covert FBI operative) Michael Milan also points toward another critical Lansky connection that may have accounted for his immunity from federal harassment. \"I also knew that [J. Edgar Hoover] and Meyer Lansky sometimes broke br ead together. Mr. L. was never rousted, was rarely served with federal subpoenas, and was generally left alone to conduct his business. Mr. L., on the other hand, didn't go around shooting anybody like people in some of the other [Mafia] Families, and maki ng life embarrassing for the cops and the feds. \"So in this way everybody got along. Mr. H. could worry about his fifth column [the communists]. Mr. [Costello] could worry about keeping peace among the different Families and looking forward to retirement, and Mr. L. could worry about the cash flow in his Las Vegas casinos. “ 217"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"[82] Final Judgment 143 J. Edgar Hoover's own connections to the Lansky Crime Syndicate and to the pro - Israel lobby have been the subject of rumors and controversy for many years. It was the pro - Israel A nti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith that was largely responsible for the establishment of the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation in 1947. (Top Lansky associates have long been generous financial backers of the ADL.) The Hoover Foundation's first president was Rabbi Paul Richman, Washington director of the ADL. Hoover's longtime associate, Louis B. Nichols, the FBI's Assistant Director in charge of the Records and Communications Division of the Bureau, was the FBI's key contact with the ADL when the ADL help ed orchestrate mass sedition trials against key critics of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policy. Nichols went on to serve as president of the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation, but only after he left the FBI. Upon retirement from the bureau he signed on as Executive Vice President of Schenley Industries, a major liquor firm run by ex - bootlegger and Lansky associate Lewis R. Rosenstie1. 218 Rosenstiel himself was a very close friend of the FBI director in spite of, or perhaps precisely because of, his ti es to Lansky. THE ADL AND ORGANIZED CRIME The liquor industry, largely controlled by Jewish families such as the Bronfman family, and others, have been major contributors to the ADL, financing a large portion of its budget over the years. 219 These same liquor interests — obviously, as we have seen — had longtime contacts with Lansky from his earliest years in the bootlegging and rum - running rackets. The origins of Hoover's sponsor — the ADL — is quite interesting. The organization's initial impetus came not so m uch out of a desire to defend members of the Jewish faith, but, more so, in particular, Jewish mobsters. In the early part of this century New York City Police Commissioner Thomas Bingham had begun a dedicated investigation of organized crime in his city. By 1908 Bingham was under fire and being accused of being \"anti - Semitic\" for pointing out the role of certain Jewish gangsters in organized crime. Ultimately, Bingham was forced out of office and organized crime took hold in New York City. One of the immed iate beneficiaries of Bingham's departure was mobster Arnold Rothstein, Lansky's mentor and the undisputed Jewish underworld leader prior to the younger Lansky's rise to power. The source of the attacks on Bingham was a public relations committee formed by a corporate attorney by the name of Sigmund Livingston. By 1913 Livingston's committee had formally incorporated as the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 220"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 Israel’s Godfather [83] So it was that \"crime buster\" J. Edgar Hoover was himself a beneficiary of ADL largesse ( a large portion of which, as we have seen, came from the coffers of Lansky and his criminal syndicate.) LOOKING THE OTHER WAY Critical J. Edgar Hoover biographer Curt Gentry notes that Hoover's FBI was never strongly concerned with Lansky's activities. A ccording to Gentry, \"The Dallas and Miami field offices [of the FBI] had blind spots. As a result, there were no taps or bugs on [Lansky's protégé, New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos] Marcello, [Lansky's Tampa Mafia underling Santo] Trafficante, and, except for a brief period, Meyer Lansky. \"221 (In Chapter 10, Chapter 11, and Chapter 12 we will explore Lansky's relationships with Marcello, Trafficante and other \"Mafia\" figures further.) Gentry adds: \"There was a rumor, often heard in the underworld, that Meyer L ansky had his own man very high up in the FBI. William Sullivan had his own suspect, someone close to both the director and [Hoover's close friend and second in command, Clyde] Tolson, who was reputedly living far above his means. This was one case the FBI never solved.\" 222 This same Sullivan happened to be the number three man at the FBI behind Hoover and Tolson. As head of the Bureau's highly secretive Division Five, Sullivan was in charge of domestic counterintelligence. Also in charge o f the FBI 's p art icipation in the Warren Co mmission investigation, Sullivan was not only a close friend of James Angleton, head of the Mossad desk at the CIA, but also — incredibly enough — a CIA conduit within the FBI itself. 223 (We will examine Angleton's role in the JFK ass assination in much further detail in Chapter 8 and in Chapter 16). As head of the FBI's Domestic Intelligence, Sullivan was in charge of the infamous COINTELPRO operations against, among others, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and a bevy of left - wing (and righ t - wing) political groups. 224 COINTELPRO relied heavily on the Israeli lobby's Anti - Defamation League for continuing and ongoing intelligence reports as it had since at least before World War II. A DEAD WITNESS Clearly a man with much inside knowledge, Su llivan was shot to death in a strange hunting accident on November 9, 1977 just prior to the time that he was to be called to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Sullivan, who had resigned from the FBI, having broken with Hoover, h ad told investigators that he had become disenchanted when Hoover told him personally, \"I am most concerned about having something issued so we can convince the public that Lee Harvey Oswald is the real assassin.\" 225 Whatever Sullivan did know about Hoove r — and perhaps Hoover's relationship with Meyer Lansky — will never be known."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"[84] Final Judgment 145 HOOVER'S DEAL According to Sam and Chuck Giancana, in their biography of Chicago Mafia boss, Sam Giancana, \"Hoover himself had been on the [organized crime] pad for years.\" 226 T he Giancanas say that Hoover had worked out a deal with Lansky's boyhood friend and criminal associate Frank Costello. The New York mobster would pass horse race betting tips to columnist Walter Winchell, a Hoover intimate. Winchell, in turn, would pass th e information on fixed races to Hoover. Hoover would arrange his real bets through his associates while making minimal bets on his own ticket at the horse races. According to the Giancanas, \"Hoover won every time.\" 227 That Hoover was well versed in Lansky 's criminal activities there is no question. His intelligence sources were legendary. W H A T H O O V E R K N E W Gentry sums it up well, noting that Hoover, although an inveterate gambler, knew all about what was happening in Lansky's Las Vegas casinos even though he, Hoover, avoided Las Vegas like the plague: \"[Hoover] knew who was skimming from the casino profits — and how much they were taking in. He knew where the money went and how it made its way to the top bosses. \"He also knew that some people, well connected with this place, were very unhappy with the Kennedys, John and Robert, unhappy to the point they were talking about killing them.\" \"Eventually the FBI discovered that most of the `skim’ loot went to Meyer Lansky in Miami. In a typical month in 1963, the s kim from one casino amounted to $123,500, of which Lansky kept $71,000, then transmitted the rest to the New Jersey mobster Gerald Catena. Catena distributed in the north and Lansky in Florida. Each recipient would have a small percentage of his share dedu cted for casino employees who kept mum about the operation. There were also couriers, $300,000 to a Swiss bank, $100,000 to the Bahamas.\" 228 (Later in this chapter and in Chapter 11, Chapter 12 and Chapter 15 we shall discuss Lansky's Swiss bank connection s. They are central to the joint Lansky - CIA - Israeli Mossad operation that resulted in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.) Even in the late 1960's, according to Gentry , \"Hoover still had a blind spot so far as [Lansky] was concerned.\" 229 THE ANGLETON C ONNECTION However, in 1993 author Anthony Summers provided what may be a critical missing piece of the puzzle. Summers created a media sensation when he alleged in his new biography of Hoover, Official and Confidential, and on the PBS series \"Frontline,\" that Lansky blackmailed Hoover with"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 Israel’s Godfather [85] supposed photos of Hoover engaged in homosexual activity. Although such rumors about Hoover had been commonplace for years, no well - known author had affixed his own name to the charge. Citing numerous sources — some susp ect and virtually all of them unsavory — Summers claimed that not only Lansky, but also several others had access to similar photos (which Summers is apparently unable to produce). Summers reports that former OSS man and later longtime CIA counterintelligenc e chief James Jesus Angleton also had control of the Hoover photos, as did former OSS chief William Donovan. The question, though, is whether Angleton, Donovan and company gave the photos to Lansky — or vice - versa -- either option being possible in light of La nsky's own longtime association with American intelligence. 230 That both Lansky and Angleton were in possession of such evidence is quite interesting in light of their joint interest in the welfare of the state of Israel, a subject we will be examining sh ortly. Angleton, as we shall see in Chapter 8 and Chapter 12, had been directly involved with the Lansky crime syndicate through the CIA's dealings with Lansky's drug - smuggling allies in the Corsican and Sicilian Mafias. He was also Israel's chief CIA patr on. THE GODFATHER Clearly, Meyer Lansky was very much a \"godfather\" in organized crime, far more influential than even the most powerful Mafia boss in any city in America. All of this, then, accounts for Lansky's preeminent role in the underworld. It is for this reason, then, that when we refer to the \"Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate\" we are referring to not only the \"Mafia\" but also to the powerful Jewish interests that are inter - connected here. It was the Lansky Syndicate that played a pivotal ro le in the establishment of Israel. Lansky, you see, was Israel's modern - day \"Godfather.\" Lansky was with Israel from the beginning. GUN - RUNNING FOR ISRAEL According to Hank Messick, \"Certainly Jewish gangsters have long and openly supported Jewish causes and the State of Israel. On the night Lansky's ex - partner, Bugsy Siegel, was executed, the Flamingo was taken over by Moe Sedway [a Lansky henchman]. When asked how he so conveniently happened to be in Las Vegas, [Sedway] explained that he was there to ar range a United Jewish Appeal fund drive.\" 231 Robert Lacey points out in his biography of Lansky that Israeli agents were introduced to Lansky in the summer of 1948, the year that Israel became a state. Lansky permitted the Haganah (Jewish terrorist underg round) fund - raiser, Joseph Baum, to hold a $10,000 benefit at (Lansky's gambling house), the Colonial Inn. He gave a donation himself. Lansky told them: \"I'm at your service.\" 232 (As we noted in Chapter 4, one of the smaller shareholders in the Colonial In n — at least at one point — was a Dallas nightclub keeper named Jack Ruby.)"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"[86] Final Judgment 147 Lansky also provided other \"technical assistance\" to the Israeli gun - running operations in the United States. In one instance, a Pittsburgh arms dealer's shipment of weapons to the A rabs who were fighting the Jews in Palestine was tossed overboard after Lansky talked to his friends at the New York docks. On other occasions, arms intended for the Arabs were, instead, hijacked by Lansky's henchman and shipped to Israel. L a n s k y a l s o w a s n ' t a b o v e p u t t i n g t h e s q u e e z e o n r a c k e t s buddies — Jewish and non - Jewish alike — to buy Israel bonds. \"Hey, these are a great investment,\" he would say. 233 In fact, according to journalist Robert Friedman, Lansky was later a major contributor to radical New Yor k - born Rabbi Meir Kahane who founded the militant Jewish Defense League. Kahane, who was ultimately assassinated, actually served, at one point, in the Israeli parliament. 234 And, as we shall see in Chapter 8, Kahane himself had unusual connections to Amer ican intelligence that bring his Lansky connection full circle. OPERATION UNDERWORLD It was Lansky's connection with the OSS - Naval Intelligence enterprise known as \"Operation Underworld\" that brought him into a strange global network that ultimately pave d the way for the establishment of the state of Israel. Operation Underworld was stationed at Rockefeller Center in New York and supervised by a British intelligence operative named William Stephenson (who was said to be Ian Fleming's inspiration for the f ictional character, James Bond.) It was Stephenson who worked closely with the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith as well as the FBI in coordinating anti - Nazi intelligence operations in the United States. 235 (In later years, following the establi shment of Israel, the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate - financed ADL emerged as an unregistered foreign agent for Israel, handling intelligence and propaganda operations for the Jewish State, in collaboration with the FBI and the CIA. In Chapter 17 we will examine the ADL's role more fully, particularly in regard to its manipulation of the media. ) In any case, as we shall see in Chapter 15, it was Operation Underworld's William Stephenson who became a critical player in the establishment of Israel's Mossad. Stephenson's top aide was Louis Bloomfield, later an attorney for the Lansky - linked Bronfman bootlegging family and himself a key player in the conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. (We shall examine Bloomfield in detail in Chapter 15.) There is litt le question but that Stephenson and Bloomfield were in close contact with Lansky and his henchmen during this period. Lansky himself, as we have seen, acknowledged his own role in Operation Underworld. 236 Following World War II, the activities of Operation Underworld and many of the key players shifted to a new front: the establishment of Israel."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148 Israel’s Godfather [87] Both Stephenson and Bloomfield were integral to gunrunning operations on behalf of the Jewish terrorist underground that later emerged as the government of the n ew Jewish State in 1948. It was in 1947 that Rudolph Sonneborn (husband of New York publisher Dorothy Schiff) set up an entity known as the Sonneborn Institute. It was this institute that provided the Jewish Haganah, and later the Irgun, in Palestine with arms and money. The Institute's coordinator for arms smuggling to the Jewish underground was Louis Bloomfield. Working with Bloomfield were liquor baron Samuel Bronfman, one Hank Greenspun (about whom we shall see much more later in Chapter 17) and Lansky himself. 237 It was during the 1947 - 1948 period that Teddy Kollek, later mayor of Jerusalem, was in charge of the Haganah station in Lansky's then - base of operations, New York City. He was said to be the formal liaison with American organized crime. 238 Ko llek worked with the Lansky Syndicate and ultimately had contact with yet another key player in our story, one James Jesus Angleton — a controversial figure indeed. 239 It was Angleton, an OSS man, who later became a top - ranking figure in the American CIA an d Israel's chief contact — some would say co - opted agent and loyalist — within CIA ranks. Angleton worked closely with Jewish underground activities both in London and in Italy and was instrumental in orchestrating U.S. intelligence collaboration with the Cors ican Mafia and the Sicilian Mafia in intelligence operations during these same years and thereafter. (In Chapter 8 and Chapter 16 we shall examine Angleton's CIA activities, working closely with Israel and of his pivotal role in the JFK assassination and c over - up conspiracy in detail.) Clearly, during the period of the establishment of Israel, Meyer Lansky was directly and intimately involved with all of the major players. Many of these same people would later be involved with Lansky in what some call \"the crime of the century.\" The Russian - born Jewish immigrant had come a long way from the slums of Brooklyn to a singular and pre - eminent role in global power politics. Indeed, Lansky was emerging as the \"godfather\" of a newly born nation: Israel. ISRAEL: A B ASE OF OPERATIONS The real key to the Lansky connection with Israel is money. The newly - established State of Israel not only needed money to exist, but the organization of a new government was an ideal opportunity for Lansky and his confederates to establ ish their own worldwide financial — and criminal — network. In its early years Israel was \"untouchable.\" The emotional memories of the experiences of the Jewish people during World War II — indeed throughout history — were the foundations upon which Israel had bee n established. Criticism of Israel was verboten. The new Jewish"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"[88] Final Judgment 149 State was an ideal cover under which Lansky and his criminal syndicate could operate unfettered. MONEY LAUNDERING Lansky's status as organized crime's chief financier and grand wizard of m oney laundering put Lansky in a particularly central position. Organized crime writer Ed Reid's description of Lansky pinpoints Lansky's role precisely: \"With his brother Jake, [Lansky] rules the gambling roost of the crime syndicate and may be the direct link between unknown moneyed nabobs who stash away mob dollars in foreign banks and the cash vaults of the U.S. criminal cartel.\" 240 It was Lansky's foreign banking connection that draws him into the web of Israel's international intrigue to the utmost. RABBI TIBOR ROSENBAUM Lansky's primary link with Israeli intelligence and financial operations came through the entity of the Banque de Credit International in Geneva Switzerland. This bank emerged as Lansky's primary European money - laundering operation. 2 41 This bank was the brainchild of one Tibor Rosenbaum. An Orthodox rabbi, Rosenbaum served for a period as international vice president of the World Jewish Congress (of which Lansky - connected Bronfman family member Edgar Bronfman has served as president). Rosenbaum also was a co - founder of the World Zionist Congress and a director of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, Switzerland. 242 However, and most importantly, Rosenbaum had served as Director General for Finance and Supply for Israel's secret intelligence a gency, the Mossad. Rosenbaum was, very clearly, a key figure in Israel's international intrigue and a critical player in the world of organized crime syndicate boss Meyer Lansky. Rosenbaum, among other things, also served on the board of the Swiss - Israel T rade Bank, established by Pinchas Sapir, Israel's Finance Minister and a Mossad officer. 243 It was during the time he served on the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank that Rosenbaum created the Banque de Credit International (BCI). THE BANQUE DE CREDIT INTERNATIONA L BCI — Meyer Lansky's European money laundering bank — was very much an Israeli government/Mossad operation, critical to the survival of the Jewish State. Indeed, one of the board members of BCI was Zwi Recheter, director of the Bank Hapoalim, one of Israel' s largest banks and a wholly - owned subsidiary of Israel's Histadrut, the national labor confederation. 244 What's"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 Israel’s Godfather [89] more, BCI held the bulk of funds for the World Jewish Congress and the Jewish Agency, no minor deposits by any means. BCI was to become Mey er Lansky's primary overseas money laundering bank — sharing those money laundering services that the bank provided to Israel's Mossad. In fact, during its heyday, BCI included among its board of directors two longtime Lansky associates, Edward Levinson and John Pullman. 245 As we noted in Chapter 6, Levinson was one of the operators of the Fremont Casino in Las Vegas, a front man for Lansky's close friend, Joseph \"Doc\" Stacher, and a frequent business partner of Bobby Baker, reputed \"bagman\" for Lyndon Johns on. John Pullman, about whom we shall learn more later in this chapter and in Chapter 12 and Chapter 15, was Lansky's key international money handler. The extent of Lansky's Israeli connection — through Rosenbaum's BCI — first became part of the public record in 1970 during the criminal trial of Alvin Malnik, one of Lansky's lieutenants. Testimony in the trial revealed that one of the main money laundering channels for the illegal proceeds of the Lansky Crime Syndicate's narcotics, vice and gambling rackets in the United States was Tibor Rosenbaum's BCI. Rosenbaum's bank received its Lansky Crime Syndicate cash flow mainly through the Lansky - dominated Bank of World Commerce in Nassau, Bahamas. The middleman was a Swiss national, Sylvain Ferdmann, a courier for L ansky. Ferdmann was an official of Rosenbaum's bank, an associate of the Bank of World Commerce (controlled by Lansky's longtime crony, John Pullman) and a legman for Investors Overseas Services (IOS), the fiefdom of financier Bernard Cornfeld. Cornfeld, i n fact, was sponsored by Rosenbaum, and had emerged as a major money launderer for Lansky's global drug trafficking. Millions in small bills were transferred from Lansky's casinos, often masked as Israeli Bond sales and contributions to Jewish philanthropi es. 246 This, of course, an outrageous betrayal of honest supporters of the Zionist cause. (In Chapter 12 we shall examine in detail how as a result of active U.S. involvement in the region, the Lansky Syndicate used the cover of CIA covert activities in So utheast Asia to carry out multi - billion dollar drug smuggling operations.) Investigative reporter Jim Hougan focused on the Lansky - Rosenbaum c o n n e c t i o n a n d i t s c e n t r a l l i n k t o I s r a e l ' s i n t e r n a t i o n a l operations — particularly those of the Mossad: \"During the Second World War [Rosenbaum had become] a hero of the resistance through his underground activities on behalf of the Jews. \"After the war he became a delegate to the World Zionist Congress in Basel, where plans were made for the creation of Israel, and wor ked in various European capitals for the Palestine Liberation office (forerunner of the Jewish Agency). This was at the height of Zionist terrorist attacks in Palestine. A superb clandestine operator, Rosenbaum is said to have been instrumental in providin g weapons to the Haganah and Stern Gang. That"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"[90] Final Judgment 151 would tend to explain why the International Credit Bank [i.e. Banque de Credit International or BCI], `Rosenbaum's Baby,\" became gambling czar Meyer Lansky's Number One conduit abroad. \"Rosenbaum was more tha n a friend to the Jews, however. When his bank was rocked with scandal after the collapse of [Bernard Cornfeld's] IOS, the newspaper Ha'aretz solemnly declared, 'Tibor Rosenbaum is Israel.' And the paper wasn't far from wrong. While Rosenbaum's bank facili tated the flight - capital schemes worked by IOS, it also served as a source of secret funds for the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, and as one of the country's primary weapons brokers. At one point 'as much as ninety percent of the Israeli Defense Mi nistry's external budget flowed . . . through Rosenbaum's bank on the Rue de Conseil General.' \"In economic matters he was equally important, founding the Israel Corporation with the help of Baron Edmond de Rothschild, a French aristocrat committed to the Zionist cause. The raison d'etre of the Israel Corporation was to raise money among the world's Jews, money to be invested in a variety of public and semi - public Israeli enterprises. By finding money abroad to fund development projects in \"the homeland,\" R osenbaum and Rothschild freed Israeli tax monies to be spent on the country's critical military needs. Accordingly, [Rosenbaum] became the \"Mr. Fixit\" of Israeli finance, cementing friendships with the country's most important military and political leader s. \"The mix of Mob, Mossad, IOS, and Rothschild monies was an intoxicating one in which the common denominator appears to have been a love of Israel. Certainly Rosenbaum and Cornfeld shared that affection with Lansky and the French baron.\" 247 THE ISRAEL C ORPORATION There is yet another interesting Lansky - BCI - Israel link in the aforementioned Israel Corporation. It was Rosenbaum's BCI that held the bulk of funds for the Israel Corporation, a $200 million investment trust. The founders of the Israel Corpora tion included a host of longtime figures who moved in Lansky's sphere of influence. Prominent among them was Sam Rothberg of the National Distilleries. Rothberg, in fact, was one of the initial investors in Lansky's first Las Vegas casino, established by B enjamin Siegel, the Flamingo Hotel. Rothberg was one of the leading lights in the American Jewish community and the U.S. director of the Israeli Bonds drive. Rothberg later came to Lansky's aid and fought against Lansky's forced return to the United States to face criminal charges following Lansky's flight to Israel (more about which later in this chapter.) Others included two interesting figures in particular:   Shaul Eisenberg, Israel's wealthiest industrialist and longtime Mossad operative — a key figure in Israel's nuclear bomb project; and   Philip M. Klutznick, a top - ranking figure in the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B’nai B’rith. 248"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152 Israel’s Godfather [91 ] The ADL connection here is interesting in that it further backtracks to Lansky's BCI - Rosenbaum linkage. Klutznick, who had been associated with the Lansky - linked Sonneborn Institute gunrunning operations coordinated by Louis M. Bloomfield (mentioned earlier), had become chairman of the board of the American Bank and Trust Company. American Bank and Trust was a subsidiary of the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank, a Mossad financial operation of which Rosenbaum and his long - time associate, Shaul Eisenberg, had been directors. By coincidence — maybe not — Swiss - Israel Trade Bank assumed management of American Bank and Trust on a very memor able day: November 22, 1963. 249 Installed as one of the new directors of the company was New York businessman Abe Feinberg. It was Feinberg, whom we first met in Chapter 4, who was instrumental in arranging highly critical American Jewish financial support for the 1960 presidential campaign of then - Senator John F. Kennedy. American Bank and Trust had an unhappy ending. The company was looted in 1975 - 76 by financier David Gravier who subsequently was supposed to have died in an airplane crash in Mexico. Tibo r Rosenbaum's BCI also, incidentally, had a similarly unhappy ending. The bank collapsed in 1974 resulting in a scandal that shook Israel to its core. In his book, Jews and Money: The Myths and the Reality, author Gerald Krefetz details the collapse of the Lansky - Mossad banking operation. THE ADL BANKS The Bank of Miami Beach and the City National Bank of Miami were Lansky's chief money laundering banks in the United States and both included several Lansky associates, most notably one Max Orovitz, as dire ctors. In 1963, in fact Lansky began planning the installation of his gambling casinos in the Bahamas in Orovitz' office. Finally, when Lansky himself ultimately settled in Israel, he initially took up residence in the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv, owned by Lansk y's Miami banker friend, Orovitz. Lansky's Miami banks were central to Lansky's gambling operations in the Caribbean. According to former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow, the Bank of Miami Beach \"was originally set up to service Cuban casinos operated by organized crime and continued to perform laundering services through the 1960s — and was still considered mob - connected. It was considered a sister bank of the Miami National Bank in the 1960s, sharing many of the same directors and performing many of the sa me services.\" 250 These Miami banks, additionally, have close ties to the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, Israel's intelligence and propaganda arm in this country. For example, Leonard Abess was chairman and founder of City National Bank of Miami. His bank managed ADL Foundation funds and Abess himself served as ADL national vice chairman. 251 City National's chairman, beginning in 1982, was Donald Beazley, who was a former director of the mysterious Australian Nugan Hand Bank. 252 The Nugan Hand Ba nk, the subject of an interesting study by"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"[92] Final Judgment 153 Jonathan Kwitny entitled The Crimes of Patriots, has been repeatedly linked to international drug money trafficking out of Southeast Asia conducted through the conduit of CIA operations in the region. (And as we shall see in Chapter 12, Lansky utilized the CIA's activities in Southeast Asia as a cover for his drug - running operations which were, in fact, carried out hand - in - hand with the CIA. In Chapter 15, however, we shall see the Lansky - Rosenbaum connection on ce again, and in further detail. Their linkage is critical to recognizing the important role that Israel played in the JFK assassination conspiracy. THE GODFATHER GOES HOME It was in 1970, finally, that Meyer Lansky pulled up stakes and settled in Israel . Under Israel's unique \"Law of Return\" any Jew from anywhere in the world could claim Israeli citizenship. That is what Lansky did. At home in the United States, Lansky was under criminal investigation. Exile in Israel seemed a likely way of escaping the trouble. Israel was an ideal location for Lansky to relocate his operations and he set about plans for setting up the Jewish State as the new, formal headquarters for his global crime syndicate. As Hank Messick put it: \"As chairman of the board of the Synd icate International, [Lansky] could operate just as easily — perhaps more easily — from Tel Aviv as Miami Beach.\" 253 Lansky's longtime associate Joseph (Doc) Stacher had already gone to Israel to live. So had a wide - ranging assortment of other American Jewis h mobsters, including Lansky's good friend Phil \"The Stick\" Kovolick. The Mossad - dominated government of Israel seemed to welcome these criminals as new countryman. Israel, according to Newsweek, \"appeared to be motivated by self - interest. Each year, Lansk y and his underworld associates pour vast sums into Israeli bonds and Israeli philanthropies. MOB MONEY IN ISRAEL \"As the daily Ha'aretz saw it, the government seemed afraid of losing the millions of dollars in illicit money first 'laundered' in mob - cont rolled institutions and then funneled into Israeli business and industry. „254 Lansky's initial entree to Israel was quietly orchestrated. Word leaked out that a wealthy \"Miami philanthropist” had taken up residence in the Jewish State. However, circumstanc es beyond Lansky's control made matters difficult for the grand wizard of the underworld. During his stay in Israel, two American grand juries (in March of 1971 and in June of 1972) handed down indictments against Lansky and several of his associates. The first indictment charged — correctly, of course — that Lansky had been skimming millions from the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The second indictment charged Lansky with income tax evasion. There were more than a few honest, law - abiding Israelis who objected to the \"chairman of the board\" staking his future in Israel, and the political"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 Israel’s Godfather [ 93] pressure was such that there was widespread clamor for his deportation. It didn't help matters that fearless crime reporter Hank Messick's biography of Lansky appeare d during that same period and portions of it appeared in the Israeli press. Lansky himself made his own loyalties clear, however. In a friendly series of interviews with Ma'ariv, an Israeli daily, Lansky said, \"I don't care what they wrote and write about me in America. I care what they think of me in Israel.\" 255 Between the public outcry in Israel and pressure from American authorities, the Israel government buckled and agreed to expel Lansky. However, the \"boss of all bosses\" appealed his expulsion all th e way to the Israeli Supreme Court. The emotional issue of a Jew who had made \"aliyah\" and settled in Israel under the Law of Return — and who was then being expelled to face possible punishment in a criminal court in another country — played heavily in Lansky 's favor. However, despite Lansky's best efforts — including an offer of $10,000,000 if he was permitted to remain — he was forced to return to the United States. LANSKY IN DECLINE By this time, Lansky was in ill health and even underwent open - heart surgery. However, as the Wall Street Journal noted: \"Whenever the heat [was] on — an investigation made public, a grand jury inquiry, a new task force of federal crime fighters on his trail — stories suddenly abound that Meyer Lansky is dying of cancer or some other t erminal illness. In the files of the New York State Police, there exists a report made out in the 1920's that says Meyer Lansky is a bad guy, all right, but there's no need to worry because he's a sickly man who won't live out the year.\" 256 But Lansky's tr aditional magical powers over the American criminal justice system were still with him. First of all, a jury in his home base of Miami acquitted him on the income tax evasion charges. Then, in mob - controlled Nevada, the criminal charges against Lansky were thrown out of court on the basis that Lansky was in ill health. And in Washington, U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork decided that going after Lansky — the ruling boss of international organized crime — was not in the nation's best interests. Bork decided tha t the Justice Department just didn't have a case against Lansky. The case was dropped. 257 Lansky had once again prevailed — to nobody's surprise. (Bork later suffered an ignominious rejection by the Senate when nominated for the Supreme Court. However, it wa s not Bork's pandering to Lansky that weighed against him — although it probably should have.) Lansky's remaining years were quiet ones spent with his wife and dog and an assortment of other aging racketeers. He still maintained some oversight over his busin ess operations but increasing health problems continued to plague him. The mastermind behind the global crime syndicate finally died on January 15, 1983."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"[94] Final Judgment 155 In his final years — and posthumously — Lansky (with the willing help of Hollywood and the rest of the m edia) became a folk hero of sorts. Gangsterism was being made fashionable — even as the glory days of John F. Kennedy and Camelot were being trashed by that same media. Lansky's days with Benjamin Siegel were glamorized in films such as The Gangster Chronicl es, The Neon Empire, and in Mobsters, where a host of teen idols played Lansky, Siegel, Costello and Luciano in their early years. Author Robert Lacey — who had previously written a glowing profile of the British royal family — turned his attention to the roya l family of the international crime syndicate and produced — with the help of the Lansky family — a Lansky biography, Little Man: Meyer Lansky and the Gangster Life. Lacey's epic tells much — but ignores a lot. He would have us believe that Lansky was, more than anything, a devoted family man, and not the ruthless thug that he truly was. Even as Lacey's Lansky biography was hitting the bookstores, yet another Hollywood production brought Lansky to the screen. This film, Bugsy, starring heart - throb Warren Beatty a s Benjamin Siegel, cast the highly - regarded actor Ben Kingsley (who had even played Mahatma Gandhi) as a wise and all - knowing Meyer Lansky. However, the Hollywood versions of the life and times of Meyer Lansky were far from the truth, no matter how colorfu l a story they told about the evil genius they portrayed. Thus, even in death, Meyer Lansky prevailed. Lansky's central role As a virtual middleman between the high - level forces that conspired in the assassination of John F. Kennedy has been cleverly burie d by a willing media. \"Israel's Godfather\" was lionized almost as a misunderstood statesman. Meyer Lansky, however, was not that. Instead, Lansky was a cynical, cold - blooded killer who had ordered the death of his closest friend — Benjamin Siegel — and who cer tainly had no qualms about helping orchestrate the murder of an American president who threatened not only his own survival, but that of his beloved State of Israel."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Chapter Eight Thick as Thieves: A Dangerous Liaison — J a mes J esus Ang let o n a nd t he Unho ly Allia nce B et w e e n I s ra e l, t h e C I A and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate B y 1 9 6 3 J o h n F .

At the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters at Langley, Virginia there was one man who knew perhaps better than any other American, Israel's intentio ns and attitudes toward President John F. Kennedy. This was the enigmatic James Jesus Angleton. Angleton was so close to the Israelis during his tenure at the CIA that, following his death in 1987, a monument was unveiled in Israel by its government in his honor. This is one of the few known public monuments to any American CIA official anywhere in the entire world but actually one of several memorials to Angleton in Israel. According to Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, co - authors of Dangerous Liaison: The Insid e Story of the U.S. - Israeli Covert Relationship, Angleton was \"a man who for nearly a quarter of a century was one of the most powerful and mysterious figures in the CIA.\" 258 According to the Cockburns, \"Angleton was involved in many strange and secret dea lings in the world of intelligence, but the Israelis like to talk of him as having been especially close to them, which is why they paid public homage to his memory.\" 259 Recruited into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) while at Yale University, Angle ton was a fast - rising star in the world of clandestine activities, and following the abolition of the OSS after World War II, Angleton entered into service with the Central Intelligence Agency after the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"[96] Final Judgment 157 CIA was established in 1947. By 1954 Angleton assum ed the highly sensitive post of chief of CIA counterintelligence. What's more, Angleton's influence within the CIA itself was of a greater magnitude than what otherwise might be expected. Angleton was a very powerful — and secretive — man. POWERFUL PATRONS A ccording to Angleton's biographer, Tom Mangold, CIA Director Allen Dulles and his deputy, Richard Helms, who later went on to become CIA director under Lyndon Johnson, were Angleton's mentors. However, Mangold says, Helms was Angleton's \"chief patron.\" 260 Dulles, of course, was later fired as CIA director by JFK and then, in a twist of fate — or by someone's design — served on the Warren Commission which ostensibly investigated JFK's murder. And it would be Helms, along with Angleton, who would later be implic ated in a strange series of events — examined in Chapter 16 in detail — that would ultimately and apparently unwittingly blow the lid off the CIA's involvement in the JFK assassination. A POWER UNTO HIMSELF According to the CIA spymaster's biographer, \"Angle ton's long - standing friendships with Dulles and Helms were to become the most important factor in giving him freedom of movement within the CIA. [Angleton] was extended such trust by his superiors that there was often a significant failure of executive con trol over his activities. The result was that his subsequent actions were performed without bureaucratic interference. The simple fact was that if Angleton wanted something done, it was done. He had the experience, the patronage, and the clout. \"In the six ties the Counterintelligence Staff, for example, had its very own secret slush fund, which Angleton tightly controlled. This fund gave him easy access to a large amount of money that was never audited (as other such funds were). Angleton argued that he wou ld have to be trusted, without outside accountability, because it would have been difficult to allow mere clerks to go through his accounts — if only because sources would have to be revealed. The [directors of central intelligence] (including Helms) agreed to this unusual arrangement, which gave Angleton a unique authority to run his own little operations without undue supervision.\" 261 In short, according to Peter Dale Scott, Angleton \"managed a 'second CIA' within the CIA\" 262 and one, as we shall see, that was collaborating all too comfortably close with Israel's Mossad.

Through these"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 Thick As Thieves [97] connections, Angleton was able to manipulate intelligence activities around the globe. A friend of Angleton recalls: \"That's the job that was so sensitive and that's the one that you don't read about. While he was liaising with everyone, he was getting them to do favors for either the CIA — things the CIA didn't want to carry out directly; like they've never killed anyone, right? — or for his own agenda. \"Even on a more mundane level, he could use his contacts with Israeli intelligence, which he kept to himself, as authority for whatever line he was trying to push at the CIA. You know, 'My Israeli sources tell me such and such,' and no one was going to contradict him, since no one else was allowed to talk to Israeli intelligence. \"I always had the impression that he used the Israelis in this way, getting them to say that the Russians had not really broken with the Chinese or whatever. They would be perfectly happy to do him the favor. On top of all that he felt that he was getting the benefit of Israeli networks and connections all over the place, not just in the Communist bloc.\" 264 One friend of Angleton's (who didn't necessarily share the counterintelligence chief's infatuation with Israel) commented: \"You have to understand that Jim's central dominating obsession was communism, something that for him was the essence of absolute and profound evil. For him nothing else really mattered, but he would use anyone and anything to combat it. Sure he liked Israelis . . . bu t he was not a 'co - opted Israeli agent,' as some people in Washington used to call him.\" 265 BEN - GURION'S MAN IN WASHINGTON Most important to Angleton, however, was his relationship with the Mossad. In fact, he was the CIA's longtime, self - appointed man at the agency's Israel desk. Angleton's biographer, Tom Mangold, points out that \"The legends alone surrounding his twenty years as head of the Israeli Desk would fill another book, as indeed would the truth.\" 266 And although Mangold's account of Angleton' s career devoted hardly any attention to Angleton's intimate ties with Israel and its Mossad, Mangold does state flatly: \"I would like to place on the record, however, that Angleton's closest professional friends overseas, then and subsequently, came from the Mossad and that he was held in immense esteem by his Israeli colleagues and by the state of Israel, which was to award him profound honors after his death.\" 267 Angleton, in fact, had long - standing direct ties with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurio n himself, dealing with the Israeli leader on an intimate basis. If there was anyone in the CIA who knew of Ben - Gurion's distaste for JFK, it was Angleton. As a devoted friend of Israel — and chief liaison with the Mossad — Angleton had to be fully aware of th e raging conflict between the Israeli prime minister and the American president who refused to bow to Israel's demands. And considering President Kennedy's efforts to build bridges with the Soviet Union and his efforts to wind down the Cold War, one knows,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"[98] Final Judgment 159 beyond question, that Angleton — hard - line, even fanatical anti - communist that he was — viewed Kennedy's overtures with outrage and disgust. All of this not to mention Kennedy's own conflicts with the CIA which we will review in Chapter 9. KENNEDY A THREAT Clearly, John F. Kennedy was not only a threat to Israel and the CIA and their allies in the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate, but also to James Jesus Angleton himself. Kennedy's war with the CIA could spell an end to Angleton's career and the world - wide intelligence empire that the strange and calculating counterintelligence boss had assembled. The ties between Angleton's CIA and the Mossad were such, according to historian Steven Stewart, that they \"had the effect of ensuring that virtually every C IA man in the Middle East was also working at second hand for the Israelis . . . as the CIA's policy changed almost overnight, in an extraordinary volte - face, from being largely pro - Arab to becoming almost totally pro - Israeli\" 268 — a close relationship inde ed. THE CIA AND ISRAEL: EARLY DAYS It is the CIA's relationship with Israel that is most significant in terms of that agency's global intrigue — and, of course, in light of the CIA's documented role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy (which we examine in more detail in subsequent chapters). And it was Angleton who was, as we have seen, the prime mover behind the CIA - Israeli Mossad's close working relationship — in fact, from its very beginnings. The late Wilbur Crane Eveland, a former advisor to the CIA and former member of the policy - planning staffs of the White House and Pentagon, had written extensively on the U.S. - Israeli relationship. In his book, Ropes of Sand, Eveland reviewed the beginnings of what Andrew and Leslie Cockburn call the \"dangerous li aison\" — America's covert relationship with Israel. This covert relationship was conducted primarily through the aegis of Angleton's Israeli desk at the CIA. Eveland writes of its origins: \"CIA operations had started before Allen Dulles became director that had long - range implications from which the United States might find it difficult to disengage. Stemming from his wartime OSS liaison with Jewish resistance groups based in London, James Angleton had arranged an operational - intelligence exchange agreement w ith Israel's Mossad, upon which the CIA relied for much of its intelligence about the Arab states.\" 269 This relationship, however, was not necessarily initially based on mutual trust. According to Wolf Blitzer, longtime Washington correspondent for the Je rusalem Post, the CIA - Mossad relationship began on a basis of mutual distrust. Blitzer notes that after Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran (sparking the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 - 1981), the militants seized CIA documents which they later released."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"160 Thick as Thieves [99] \"The documents,\" says Blitzer, \"showed that Israeli intelligence agencies, mostly in the 1950's, had blackmailed, bugged, wire - tapped, and offered bribes to U.S. government officials in an effort to gain sensitive intelligence and technical in formation.\" 270 The U.S. was apparently also spying on Israel, although this didn't appear in the report. However, when it was necessary for the CIA and the Mossad to reach a joint accord, it was James Jesus Angleton who stepped in, and, according to Blitz er, \"was said to have been largely responsible for arranging the deal.\" 271 ASSASSINATION PLOTS The CIA and the Mossad had many joint ventures over the years, all conducted under Angleton's watchful eye. Some of those ventures, of course, included assassi nation plots. In fact, after President Eisenhower commented that he hoped that \"the Nasser problem could be eliminated\" 272 — (referring to what he perceived to be an intransigence by the Egyptian) — CIA Director Allen Dulles and Angleton launched a plan to kil l Nasser. However, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (brother of the CIA director) intervened and called off the CIA dogs. The CIA was also engaging in covert actions against Israel's enemies in Syria. One CIA conspiracy in 1958 to overthrow the nation alist government of Syria — which anti - communist fanatics such as Angleton considered to be \"leftist\" — fell apart when the CIA's paid henchmen, Syrian nationals (who evidently were patriots), turned themselves in and exposed the CIA's plot to the Syrian gover nment. At the time, CIA director Dulles commented, \"I guess that leaves Israel's intelligence service as the only one on which we can count, doesn't it?\" 273 ANGELTON'S ZR/RIFLE TEAM The CIA's now - best known assassination plot, of course, was the agency' s collaboration with organized crime in a scheme to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro. (We will examine the Castro assassination plot in much further detail in Chapter 11.) It is interesting to note, however, at this juncture, that as part of the plot against Castro the CIA established its now - infamous ZR/Rifle Team, incorporating a wide array of foreign assassins and mercenaries — skilled and dangerous men who were trained in murder. The ZR/Rifle Team, in fact, was one of Angleton's pet in - house CIA projects wh ich he ran in conjunction with his CIA colleague, William Harvey. 274 This, in the long run, as we shall see in Chapter 16, gave Angleton and his Israeli allies access to the \"talent\" necessary to achieve a successful operation in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Te xas on November 22, 1963. A FIRM ALLIANCE"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"[100 ] Final Judgment 161 According to intelligence historian Richard Deacon, Israel's relationship with the CIA (and Angleton, in particular) had been firmly cemented: \"On the American side the Israelis had won a certain amount of unoffi cial support from the CIA even during the Eisenhower era. The CIA had been realistic enough to realize that the Eisenhower appeasement policy towards the Arab world would ultimately be disastrous for every American interest, military or economic. \"For this reason they had maintained a policy of allowing all intelligence operations in Israel to be carried out entirely by the Mossad. In short, what this meant was that the CIA had no office or station chief in Tel Aviv, but that certain officers in the US Emba ssy there co - operated with the Mossad. In theory this entailed an exchange of intelligence between the two sides and in practice this worked rather better than one could have expected normally. \"The key figures in this arrangement were originally [Mossad c hief] Isser Harel, Ephraim Evron, who later became deputy Israeli ambassador in Washington, and James Angleton, chief of the CIA Counter - Intelligence.\" 275 (Evron, as we saw in Chapter 6, also became particularly close to John F. Kennedy's successor, Lynd on Johnson, who reversed U.S. policy toward Israel — and in favor of the CIA's interventionist policies in Southeast Asia — immediately upon assuming office.) According to intelligence historian Deacon, Angleton exploited the new intimate relationship between the CIA and the Mossad for use internationally: \"Angleton, having seen the folly of U.S. foreign policy during the abortive Suez operation, decided to counteract the State Department's bias towards the Arabs by close cooperation with Israel. It was he who first saw the need for a new policy in the Middle East and safeguards against increasing Russian influence. A REVERSAL OF POLICY \"He and Evron worked well together and, as a result, the CIA helped Israel with technical assistance in the nuclear field. Ev ron was eager to grasp this opportunity for he had been one of the prime instigators of the aggressive challenge to [John F. Kennedy's] policy of friendship for Nasser [and] was instrumental in paving the way to a reversal of the pro - Arab policy which for a while dominated American thinking, not only under Eisenhower, but also the Kennedy administration.\" 276 According to Deacon, Evron was Israel's most powerful figure in Washington, more highly regarded than even the Israeli ambassador and was welcomed as a Mossad liaison officer to Angleton at the Central Intelligence Agency. 277 ANGLETON AND ISRAEL'S NUCLEAR BOMB There is, in fact, evidence that Angleton was covertly assisting Israel's nuclear bomb program which, of course, was the primary source of confl ict between JFK and Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"162 Thick as Thieves [101] Tad Szulc, the noted foreign correspondent, \"quoted sources close to Angleton as saying that he had indeed secretly aided Israel with technical nuclear information during the late 1950's.\" 278 A dditionally, Seymour Hersh reported that Szulc's report \"fits in with something [Hersh] had been told by a high - level CIA official — that Angleton gave the Israelis similar technical information in the mid - 1960s.\" 279 We do know that one of Angleton's \"closes t colleagues\" from his days in the OSS in Italy was a former leader of the Jewish underground, Meir Deshalit, the older brother of Amos Deshalit, a physicist who was one of the leaders in Israel's drive to build a nuclear bomb. 280 The evidence also sugges ts that Angleton was a key player in attempts within the CIA itself to cover up Israel's secret nuclear weapons development. John Hadden, who was the CIA station chief in Tel Aviv before his retirement in 1960, is evidently the CIA officer who first report ed (perhaps incorrectly) that an Apollo, Pennsylvania company, the Nuclear Materials & Equipment Corporation (NUMEC), was illegally providing bomb - grade uranium for Israel's nuclear weapons development. THEODORE SHACKLEY However, Hadden faced much opposi tion from within the CIA. One individual in particular, the assistant to the deputy director for covert operations, was constantly attacking Hadden, belittling his claims. This was the ubiquitous Theodore Shackley, nicknamed \"the Blonde Ghost.\" Shackley, a s we'll see in Chapter 11, was a key CIA player in CIA - Lansky Syndicate plots against Fidel Castro. And it was also Shackley, as we shall see in Chapter 12, who was a key CIA player in Southeast Asia during the joint CIA - Lansky drug - trafficking operations in the region. Later, following his retirement from the CIA, Shackley entered into lucrative international arms dealing ventures with Shaul Eisenberg, a key Mossad operative and a major figure in Israel's nuclear development program. And later in these pag es we will learn much more about the connections of both Shackley and his future business partner Eisenberg. Here, however, we see Shackley engaged in covering up Israeli operations in the nuclear development arena — along with Angleton. According to Hadden, Angleton \"had no interest in stopping „281 the NUMEC operation, and did not. Hadden comments: \"Why would someone whose whole life was dedicated to fighting communism have any interest in preventing a fiercely anti - communist nation from getting the means to defend itself?\" 282 However, as we will see in Appendix Nine there is much more to the NUMEC story than meets the eye. SECRET MEMORANDUM As we noted, in Chapter 5, an internal CIA memorandum issued during the presidency of John F. Kennedy cast negative light on Israel's nuclear"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[102] Final Judgment 163 development program. However, according to historian Stephen Green, \"It is perhaps significant that the memorandum was not drafted as a formal national intelligence estimate, which would have involved distribution to several oth er agencies of the government. No formal NIE was issued by CIA on the Israeli nuclear weapons program until 1968.\" 283 There is no question, of course, considering Angleton's close ties with Israel and its Mossad, that Angleton (and perhaps the aforementio ned Shackley) were instrumental in burying this memorandum. The CIA - Mossad joint operations relating to Israel's nuclear development continued for a generation. Many years later, the CIA and Israel jointly arranged the kidnapping of Mordechai Vanunu, a nuc lear technician who blew the whistle on Israel's nuclear weapons development. A woman used to lure Vanunu in the kidnapping conspiracy was a CIA covert action operative who also did occasional work for the Mossad. ANGLETON'S POWER INCREASES With the adve nt of the Lyndon Johnson administration and the amazing reversal of U.S. policy toward Israel, outlined in detail in Chapter 6, and with the close relationship between Angleton's Mossad liaison, Evron, and Lyndon Johnson, Angleton's influence in Middle Eas t policy - making became even greater. According to Andrew and Leslie Cockburn: \"One long - serving official at the CIA's ancient rival, the code - breaking National Security Agency, states flatly that `Jim Angleton and the Israelis spent a year cooking up the ` 67 war. It was a CIA operation, designed to get Nasser [of Egypt].' Such a verdict, from a source inside an agency that had the inclination and the facilities to monitor both the CIA and the Israelis, must carry some weight.\" 284 Now all of the aforementio ned is particularly relevant when one considers Angleton's preeminent role in the CIA - Mossad alliance. However, much new additional information has come to light which ties Angleton even further into the international web of conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ANGLETON, LANSKY & THE OSS Angleton, in fact, had intimate ties to Meyer Lansky - linked organized crime operations in Europe stemming back from his service in the OSS in England (working with British intelligence) and in Italy. And it was during this same period that Meyer Lansky himself was engaged in joint covert operations with the OSS, as noted in Chapter 7. It is also very likely that during this time Angleton came in contact with a young American officer detailed to the OSS — one Clay Shaw. As we shall see in Chapter 15, Shaw is the focal point of contact in the JFK assassination conspiracy between n o t o n l y t h e C I A a n d l o w - l e v e l e l e m e n t s i n t h e i n t e l l i g e n c e community — Lee Harvey Oswald among them — but also between Meyer"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"164 Thick as Thieves [103] Lansky's European money laundering operation based at Mossad officer Tibor Rosenbaum's Banque de Credit International (first examined in Chapter 7). THE JEWISH UNDERGROUND At the tender age of 27, Angleton — then stationed in Rome — was the youngest counter intelligence branch chief in the entire OSS and the only non - Briton in Italy cleared to share intelligence secrets of the top - secret Ultra program which was cracking Nazi codes. Italy, indeed, became a central point of contact for Angleton and his internat ional intelligence connections, and particularly for his work on behalf of the state of Israel. By 1951 Angleton was engaged in \"the underground Jewish network that ran down from Eastern Europe through Italy to the ports where shiploads of immigrants were loaded for Palestine.\" 285 It was this refugee network, according to Richard Deacon, writing in The Israeli Secret Service, a history of the Mossad, that was \"paving the way for an ultimate intelligence network for the future state of Israel. \" 286 One of A ngleton's Israeli contacts in the Jewish underground in Europe was Teddy Kollek (later to become mayor of Jerusalem). Kollek, in fact, emerged to become \"a close personal friend.\" 287 Kollek, as we saw in Chapter 7, was the Haganah station chief in New York during the 1947 - 1948 period, engaged in arms smuggling to Palestine in conjunction with Meyer Lansky and Major Louis M. Bloomfield — whom we shall see in Chapter 15, was associated with not only the aforementioned Clay Shaw, but also with Tibor Rosenbaum's Banque De Credit International. TIBOR ROSENBAUM, AGAIN But there is an even more pivotal contact between Angleton, Major Bloomfield, Shaw and Lansky: the same Tibor Rosenbaum. In Chapter 7 we met Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum of the Banque De Credit Internation al. It was Rosenbaum, who went on to serve as Director General for Finance and Supply for the Mossad, who was one of the prime movers in the refugee - turned - intelligence network with which Angleton worked so closely. It was also during this same period that the terrorist Menachem Begin (who later became prime minister of Israel) was coordinating Israel's Irgun operations in Europe. In Chapter 13, we shall find, Begin was also operating in the United States in conjunction with a key figure in the Lansky Crime Syndicate in joint efforts on behalf of Israel — and against John F. Kennedy. THE CORSICAN MAFIA CONNECTION Angleton's connections with the Lansky operations, however, go even deeper. It was through a secret CIA asset, one Jay Lovestone, that Angleton man ipulated what his biographer called \"an odd little operation that"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"[104] Final Judgment 165 Angleton had been quietly running all on his own since 1955.” 288 Through an aide, Stephen Millet, who was the counterintelligence officer who handled the Israeli desk for Angleton, the C IA spymaster was maintaining close links with the criminal underworld in Italy and France. For details on the activities of Angleton and his Lansky - linked organized crime associates we turn to the work of Robert I. Friedman. In his biography of militant Ne w York - born Rabbi Meyer Kahane (later a member of the Israeli parliament), we learn that it was the aforementioned Lovestone who provided Kahane and his closest associate and fellow rabbi, Dr. Joseph Churba, with financing and support. (Lansky, himself, as we saw in Chapter 7, was a contributor to Kahane's later activities in support of Israel.) In the 1960’s Churba and Kahane functioned as CIA assets in churning up Jewish support — and otherwise — for the war in Vietnam, a venture, we have seen, which proved f ruitful for not only the CIA, but its allies in Israel and their allies in the Lansky Syndicate. THE CIA'S HIRED GUNS According to Friedman, \"Churba and Kahane also received support from legendary cold warriors Jay Lovestone and Irving Brown, who had bee n top officials of the American Communist Party in the 1920s before undergoing a 'Damascus Road' conversion and who subsequently ran the AFL - CIO's powerful International Affairs Department under the tutelage of the CIA. It was under the CIA's direction tha t Lovestone and Brown — using Corsican and Italian mafiosos — set up right - wing death squads in Marseilles and other European cities after the Second World War to break the burgeoning left - wing labor movement. Thanks to Brown, by 1953 his key contact in the Ma rseilles underworld, Pierre Ferri - Pisain, had control of the city's port, where he built an international heroin trafficking empire. \"This was not the first time that American intelligence purchased the services of the Mafia. Prior to the Allied invasion o f Sicily in the Second World War, the OSS established contacts with the Sicilian Mafia through the same Lucky Luciano who allowed [the Jewish underground] to smuggle weapons from Hoboken to the Irgun in Palestine. The Sicilian Mafia provided intelligence o n the Germans, and after the war assassinated hundreds of Italian left - wing political activists.\" 289 According to historian Alfred McCoy, \"After the CIA withdrew from active involvement] Marseille's Corsicans won political protection from France's intellig ence service, the SDECE, which allowed their heroin laboratories to operate undisturbed for nearly 20 years. In partnership with Italy's Mafia syndicates, the Corsicans smuggled raw opium from Turkey and refined it into no. 4 heroin for export. Their bigge st customer was the United States .. . 290 (In Chapter 7 we examined Lansky's pivotal role in arranging the accommodation between the OSS and the Sicilian Mafia in the famed \"Operation Underworld.\" In Chapter 12 we will examine the Lansky - CIA manipulation o f the Corsican and Sicilian organized crime elements in the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166 Thick as Thieves [105] drug trade. In Chapter 12 , Chapter 15 and Chapter 16, we will also examine the role of French Corsican gangsters and French intelligence operatives in the JFK assassination — linking Angleton fur ther to the events in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Here, now, we see that it was Israeli Mossad ally James J. Angleton who was, in fact, the prime mover behind the CIA operations utilizing the Corsican and Sicilian organized crime elements in Angleton's \"a nti - communist\" ventures. That all of this was run through the Angleton's Israeli desk at the CIA is quite interesting, to say the least. This, of course, ties Angleton and the CIA and their collaborators in the Mossad even further into the Lansky network — a nd into the nexus revolving around the conspiracy that led to the murder of John F. Kennedy. ANGLETON, THE CIA & THE FRENCH CONNECTION However, Angleton's French intrigue went beyond his connections with the Corsican crime syndicate. He and the CIA were also dabbling in internal French politics, interfering with the political aims of French leader Charles DeGaulle and his political alliance. The CIA, in fact, was backing the Socialist Party. Historian Alfred McCoy notes that: \"On the surface it may have s eemed a bit out of character for the CIA to be backing so far left [a party] as a Socialist Party. However, there were only three major political parties in France — Socialist, Communist and Gaullist — and by a simple process of elimination the CIA wound up al lying itself with the Socialists. \"While General DeGaulle was too independent for American tastes, Socialist leaders were rapidly losing political ground to the Communists and thus were willing to collaborate with the CIA.\" 291 That Angleton and the CIA wo uld be actively working against DeGaulle is intriguing, particularly in light of further evidence we shall examine in Chapter 12, Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 which ties the CIA and its allies in Israel to joint operations against DeGaulle. It was from this s ame sphere of intrigue, as we shall see, that the JFK assassination evolved. MANIPULATING THE WARREN COMMISSION After John F. Kennedy was killed, it was Angleton who emerged as the CIA's \"overseer\" of the Warren Commission investigation into the assassin ation of Kennedy. In fact, as we shall see, Angleton maneuvered himself into this position. JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott has written of what he called \"the recurring presence of Angleton in the background of the Warren Commission investiga tion.\" 292 In 1996 new information about Angleton's peculiar role emerged when the government's JFK Assassination Records Review Board released 192 pages of heretofore - classified testimony given to the House Assassinations Committee in 1978 by a witness who was \"chief of a CIA branch responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America.\" 293 The actual"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"[ 106] Final Judgment 167 identity of the witness was considered so sensitive that the CIA insisted on withholding his real name so he testified under the alias \"John Scelso.\" A ccording to Scelso's story, it was he, \"Scelso,\" who had initially been placed in charge of the CIA's end of the assassination investigation, but — according to Scelso — Angleton \"immediately went into action to do all the investigating.\" 294 (This suggests, of course, that Angleton did have a very specific interest in controlling any evidence which did emerge.) T he testimo ny b y Scelso also brought forth so me interesting revelations about Angleton's organized crime connections. At one point in his testimony, a c ommittee attorney, Michael Goldsmith, asked Scelso the intriguing question, \"Do you have any reason to believe that Angleton might have had ties to organized crime?\" 295 to which Scelso responded in the affirmative. Scelso went on to explain that the Justic e Department had once asked the CIA to determine the true names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the mob was hiding Las Vegas \"skim\" money there. Scelso commented that \"We were in an excellent position to do this and told them so — whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, 'That is the [FBI's] business.\" 296 When Scelso discussed this with another CIA officer, the other officer \"smiled a foxy smile and said, 'Well, that's Angleton's excuse. The real reason is that Angleton himself has ti es to the Mafia and he would not want to double - cross them. \" 2 9 7 Indeed, Angleton, Israel's point man at the CIA, was well - placed to help cover up the real truth about Israel's role — along with that of the CIA and the Lansky syndicate — and ultimately he di d. THE NOSENKO AFFAIR: PLACING BLAME It was Angleton who emerged in the period of the Warren Commission investigation as the leading CIA critic of Russian Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko. Nosenko, who defected to the United States in 1964, claimed to have b een the KGB's case officer who handled Lee Harvey Oswald during his sojourn in Russia (presumably as a defector.) No senko 's mo st p r o vo cative claim was that, co ntr ar y to so me suspicions — and allegations — the Soviet KGB had absolutely nothing to do with the as sassination of John F. Kennedy. Thus, those such as Israel's man at the CIA, Angleton, who wanted to hang the blame on the KGB for the president's murder, had what appeared to be a bona fide Soviet defector on their hands whose claims ran contrary to the p ropaganda line they sought to promote. Angleton was Nosenko's loudest and most vociferous accuser, determined to prove Nosenko a liar. Angleton subjected Nosenko to 1,277 days of torture, questioning and deprivation, but Nosenko stuck to his story. Angleto n was clearly determined to disprove the one man who was clearly well - informed enough about the Soviet KGB to dispute the claim that the Soviets were behind the JFK assassination. Eliminating the Soviets as a suspect would, of course, shift suspicion elsew here. Looking elsewhere"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168 Thick as Thieves [107] for those with not only the means and the opportunity — but also the motive — to kill John F. Kennedy would have, of course, pointed in the direction of Angleton's own CIA and its allies in the Israeli Mossad. In Chapter 16 we shall s ee how Angleton did indeed play a key role in the JFK assassination cover - up. Revelation of either a CIA role or an Israeli role in the murder of JFK would have inevitably destroyed not only America's relationship with Israel, but it would have brought the international house of joint CIA - Mossad - Lansky Crime Syndicate conspiracies tumbling down. And James Jesus Angleton, as the CIA's intimate liaison with Israel, would have been destroyed in the process. Likewise with his CIA patrons, Allen Dulles and Rich ard Helms. (In Chapter 16 we shall review the activities of Angleton and Richard Helms further, particularly as they relate to the cover - up of the truth about the JFK assassination conspiracy. In Chapter 18 we shall see how Helms' close relationship with t he Iranian secret police, SAVAK — created jointly by the CIA and the Mossad — tie Helms himself even further into the realm of conspiracy in the continuing cover - up of the JFK assassination.) Angleton's \"chief patron\" Richard Helms left the CIA in 1973. This w as the beginning of the end of his days at the CIA. Angleton was fired by the new CIA director, William Colby, on December 20, 1974. And, as we shall see in Appendix Six, Angleton's firing not only had precisely to do with his unusually close affiliation w ith Israel, but ultimately may have played a part in the strange demise — years later — of William Colby. FANTASY IN BOOK FORM In his remaining years, Angleton habitually met with Washington reporters, feeding them tidbits, stroking them with information, co nvincing them all that they were getting \"the inside story\" — particularly in regard to the matter of the JFK assassination. The ultimate parlay of Angleton's Kennedy assassination dis - information appeared in Edward Jay Epstein's book, Legend: The Secret Wor ld of Lee Harvey Oswald (published in 1978). Epstein, a Warren Commission \"critic,\" first came to prominence as the author of Inquest, a book - length study of the commission, originally written as his master's thesis at Yale University, long a recruiting gr ound for the CIA. It was some years later, however, that Epstein came forth with Legend. As pointed out, however, by assassination researcher, Carl Oglesby, it was Angleton who was \"Epstein's chief source for the narrative unfolded\" 298 in Legend. Epstein's book presented the thesis that Oswald had been recruited by the Soviet KGB during his Marine service. Later KGB asset Oswald killed JFK, but not necessarily on the Kremlin's orders. Evidently, we are led to assume, Oswald got out of control. Oswald's KGB connection, according to Epstein, was subsequently covered up by a Soviet mole in the CIA and then the FBI's legendary communist hunter, J. Edgar Hoover, helped in the cover - up, for reasons of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"[108] Final Judgment 169 his own — a fanciful story indeed. Whatever the case, it was An gleton who was Epstein's most important source of \"inside\" information in the weaving of this particular \"legend.\" And interestingly enough, it was the controlled media which had otherwise scoffed at JFK conspiracy allegations that responded so favorably t o this \"new\" conspiracy story. As Carl Oglesby noted at the time Legend was published: \"Time called Epstein 'a careful, academic researcher' and said his evidence that Oswald was a Soviet spy was 'strong.' The New York Times Review of Books called it \"fasc inating, alarming and perhaps enormously significant' and praised its 'explosive qualities.' The normally chaste Wilfred Sheed swallowed the whole Angleton kaboodle and chimed in on his own that `Cuba itself seems the most likely conspirator' with Oswald. 'This one,\" he concluded, 'is a beauty.'\" 299 (And as we shall see in Chapter 17, the controlled media's own extensive links with Israel and its lobby in America, particularly the Lansky Syndicate - funded Anti - Defamation League [ADL] of B'nai B'rith, account s for the media's desire to place the blame for the JFK assassination elsewhere, other than on Angleton's CIA and his allies in Israel.) FOOLED BY A FALSE FLAG Interestingly, many American conservatives (who were certainly no admirers of the Kennedy admi nistration) fell for the Angleton - sponsored fantasy that the KGB was behind the JFK assassination. They wanted, more than anything perhaps, to believe that a communist had killed JFK. It was wholly in line with their anti - communist worldview and tailor - mad e for those who wanted to wave the proverbial \"red flag.\" (This red flag, as we shall see in these pages, however, was, in fact, yet another Israeli false flag.) Noting the conservative outcry that \"a communist killed JFK,\" Peter Dale Scott has written of \"the loud and irresponsible campaign of the American Security Council, the largest p.r. lobby for the military - industrial complex, to support the intelligence - fed claim that a KGB assassin 'had been trained at an assassin's school in the USSR for assignmen t later on the North American continent.’” 300 Since the publication of the second edition of Final Judgment, a former publicist for the American Security Council. William J. Gill, acknowledged to this author his own sincere belief (at the time) that there had been a communist role in the JFK assassination. He acknowledged that, for political reasons, he had indeed been a part of the effort to pin the assassination on the Soviets. However, having read Final Judgment Gill concluded that, as he put it, \"I thi nk you have pinned the tail on the donkey.\" In other words, that he now believed that the Israeli Mossad was indeed the prime mover behind the JFK assassination. \"It was an angle that I never even conceived possible — until now,\" he said. Gill described Fina l Judgment as \"the most important book of the 20th century.\""},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"170 Thick as Thieves [109] There is no question but that conservative elements did indeed stress the \"communist\" angle in the JFK assassination following the president's murder — for very obvious political motivations. One prominent \"right wing\" journalist of the time, Revilo P. Oliver — then a key figure in the John Birch Society — was actually called before the Warren Commission to elaborate on his controversial and widely - publicized theory that the Soviets had JFK executed b ecause he [JFK] was not doing enough to advance international communism. However, shortly before his death in 1994 Oliver told associates that had he not been so ill, he would have relished the opportunity to write a favorable review of Final Judgment whic h had just been released earlier in the year. Oliver himself evidently realized that he, too, had been taken in by the Angleton - inspired myth. Needless to say, however, the myth the Soviets were somehow involved in the JFK assassination was an ideal cover story and one that James J. Angleton was very much the prime mover behind. `A MANSION HAS MANY ROOMS' All of this is interesting and illustrates the lengths to which Angleton would go in order to fabricate a story targeting his enemies for the blame — and clearing his friends. However, Angleton's most provocative and widely known statement, often presumed to be in reference to the JFK assassination — came when he was quoted in The New York Times — two days after he was fired from the CIA by then - Director Willi am Colby. Angleton's cryptic remark was as follows: \"A mansion has many rooms. I'm not privy to who struck John.\" 301 Angleton, however, insisted that the reference had nothing to do with the JFK assassination. Angleton died a broken man on May 11, 1987 — dr iven out of the CIA to which he had devoted his lifetime. Angleton was correct: \"A mansion has many rooms.\" There was yet another secret room — so to speak — a shadowy intelligence operation working closely with Organized Crime and the CIA in a wide variety of ventures both in the United States and around the globe: James Jesus Angleton's beloved allies in Israel's Mossad. A FINAL NOTE: Since the first release of Final Judgment — which was the first JFK assassination book to seriously focus on James Angleton (bas ed upon leads provided by Mark Lane's Plausible Denial) — JFK researcher Lisa Pease (who received a copy of Final Judgment from the author) has written two excellent articles examining Angleton's critical role in the JFK affair. They appear in the book The A ssassinations (Los Angeles, Feral House Press, 2003) edited by Miss Pease and James DiEugenio. Unfortunately, although Miss Pease referenced Final Judgment, in passing in earlier renditions of her essays (when they were first published on the Internet), sh e has since deleted those references, perhaps out of fear of being associated with yours truly. In any case, Miss Pease also rushes to assure her readers that she has found no evidence to support the theory that Angleton was \"controlled\" by the Mossad, des pite her suggestion that other un - named writers have asserted as much. In fact, as readers of Final Judgment know well, no such assertion is made in this book. Quite the contrary, Angleton was a Mossad loyalist. No \"control\" was necessary."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Chapter Nine A Lit t le Unplea sa nt ness: J F K ' s W a r W i t h I s r a e l ' s A l l i e s a t t h e C I A J F K ' s b a t t l e w i t h t h e C I A o v e r t h e B a y o f P i g s d e b a c l e w a s j u s t t h e b e g i n n i n g .

In 1972 the Washington Observer newsletter publi shed perhaps what was one of the first hints — in print — that the Kennedy family itself suspected that the CIA had a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. According to the Observer, \"Back in 1963, shortly after President Kennedy's assassination, Rober t F. Kennedy while he was still Attorney General, conducted his own private investigation, which ran parallel with the official inquiry into the assassination conducted by the Warren Commission. Kennedy's investigation featured trips to this country by an Inspector Hamilton, former Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. Hamilton, an old friend of Joseph P. Kennedy, had been retained by the attorney general to help unravel the real truth about the murder of JFK. \"After long conferring with the members of the Kenn edy family and making a few discreet soundings with his own contacts, Hamilton zeroed on the fact that the assassination of John Kennedy had occurred very shortly after his brother Bobby had made some preliminary moves for direct personal control of the CI A, whose leadership he blamed for the Bay of Pigs fiasco. \"Hamilton, following the cui Bono (\"whom does it benefit?\") reasoning, reached the conclusion that Bobby's move to seize control of the CIA had something to do with the murder of his elder brother.\" 302 THE BAY OF PIGS That the Bay of Pigs debacle was a major bone of contention between the Kennedy brothers and the CIA is now very much a recognized part of history. The bittnerness that developed between JFK and the CIA over the failed attempt to inva de Castro's Cuba was a serious point of conflict between the president and the intelligence agency. The Bay of Pigs and its aftermath was a sore spot between Kennedy and the CIA, but not the last. It did, however, set in motion events leading to the final showdown between"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172 A Little Unpleasan tness [111] JFK and the CIA, what, in fact, was ultimately the assassination of the American president. The family biographers of Chicago Mafia boss, Sam Giancana, who participated in the infamous CIA - Organized Crime plots against Fidel Castro (whic h we will examine in more detail in Chapter 11) report that Giancana was very much aware that the CIA was unhappy with the Kennedys. \"Within the CIA, the dismay at having been betrayed by both the President and attorney general, as well as the President's open promise to dismantle the intelligence agency's power, soon turned to hatred, creating a ripple effect that would blacken the moods of the men [Giancana] dealt with in his covert operations. These men expressed their outrage at the Bay of Pigs operatio n along with their fear that Kennedy now posed a very real threat to the CIA's continued autonomy, perhaps its very existence.\" 303 KENNEDY MOVES AGAINST THE CIA In his best - selling, Plausible Denial, in which he pinpoints the CIA's role in the JFK assas sination conspiracy, veteran JFK assassination investigator Mark Lane commented on the CIA's move against the president: \"If the CIA operatives, officers, and former officers believed that the defense of their Agency and their nation required the eliminati on of President Kennedy because he was about to dismantle their organization, one could comprehend, while neither accepting nor condoning their viewpoint, that their concept of self - defense required them to use deadly force. Most relevant, therefore, is no t what Kennedy was or was not about to do vis - à - vis the CIA, but what the leaders of the Agency believed he might do. \"John F. Kennedy made it clear that he planned to destroy the CIA. The New York Times reported on April 25, 1966, under a subheadline, 'Ke nnedy's Bitterness,' that 'as the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him, [Kennedy] said to one of the highest officials of his Administration that he wanted 'to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.' \"He clearly was not suggesting a modest legislative proposal or executive order to modify or reform the organization. The total destruction of the Agency was his apparent objective.\" 304 CONTROLLING THE CIA Lane points out that Kennedy's preliminary actions against the CIA had already been set in motion and that the president was very clearly moving toward ultimate evisceration of the agency. \"[Kennedy] dealt with the CIA through the implementation of a three - point emergency program designed to control the agency. H e fired its most culpable and powerful leaders, he appointed a high - level committee, the Cuban study group, to investigate the misdeeds of the organization so that he might determine what additional short - range limitations were required"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"[112] Final Judgment 173 and, in the interi m, he dramatically reduced the powers and jurisdiction of the Agency and established strict limits as to its future actions through National Security Action memoranda.\" \"Kennedy then sought to control the Agency by sharply reducing its ability to act in th e future through National Security Action Memoranda 55, 56 and 57. These documents, in theory, eliminated the ability of the CIA to wage war. The CIA would not be permitted to initiate any operation requiring greater firepower than that generated by handgu ns.\" 305 That all of these actions upset the CIA and its allies is undoubted. One man on the scene at the time was Col. L. Fletcher Prouty, who served as liaison between the Defense Department and the CIA during the relevant period. According to Prouty, \"N othing I had ever been involved in my entire career had created such an uproar. NSAM 55 stripped the CIA of its cherished covert operations role, except for small actions. It was an explosive document. The military - industrial complex was not pleased.\" 306 THE CIA AND VIETNAM However, Kennedy's conflict with the CIA went well beyond the issue of Cuba. The burgeoning issue of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia had positioned the president at odds with the CIA even further. By late 1963 JFK's conflict with t he CIA was in full force and although it was not the subject of heated public discussion, the word was leaking out through official and un - official channels that there was something afoot at the highest levels. On October 3, 1963, the dean of America's new spaper columnists, Arthur Krock, was writing frankly in the New York Times of Kennedy's war with the CIA — a war which was intensifying over the issue of Vietnam. Krock's front - page article, in fact, was entitled, \"The Intra - Administration War in Vietnam.\" KENNEDY'S TRUSTED CONDUIT But what is so astounding about the column is that Krock quoted a high - level administration source as having suggested that if there were ever a coup d'etat in the United States, one might expect that it would be the CIA which wa s responsible — this just weeks before JFK was murdered. The significance of this astounding column is that it was Arthur Krock who affixed his name to this explosive report: Krock was a longtime close friend and confidant of the Kennedy family and had even ghost - written several published works on behalf of the president's father, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy. The columnist was a key Kennedy link in press circles and would have been the first and foremost choice of President Kennedy if JFK had wished to utili ze the press to bring his conflict with the CIA into the public arena. As Mark Lane so aptly described the column: \"This was John F. Kennedy"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 Little Unpleasantness [113] sending out a message to the American people through his trusted conduit Arthur Krock.\" 307 This column remained forgotten in the wake of the president's assassination, but it was in 1992 that Lane surfaced the prophetic warning and began bringing it to the attention of American audiences who now had a renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination. OUT OF CONTROL L ane described the column: \"Krock pointed out that John F. Kennedy had gone to war against the CIA. He concluded that Kennedy no longer could control the CIA. The columnist stated that President Kennedy sent Henry Cabot Lodge, his Ambassador to Vietnam, wit h orders to the CIA on two separate occasions and in both cases the CIA ignored those orders, saying that it was different from what the agency thought should be done. In other words, the CIA had decided that it — not the president — would make the decisions a s to how American foreign policy should be conducted.\" 308 Lane pointed out that a source for Krock's column was a report filed for the Scripps - Howard newspapers by foreign correspondent Richard Starnes who had interviewed a number of high - ranking administr ation officials and others who expressed their concern about the CIA's intransigence. A CIA - SPONSORED COUP D'ETAT? According to Krock's column: \"Among the views attributed to United States officials on the scene, including one described as a \"very high A merican official . . . who has spent much of his life in the service of democracy . . . are the following: The CIA's growth was \"likened to a malignancy\" which the \"very high official was not sure even the White House could control . . . any longer.\" \"If t he United States ever experiences [an attempt at a coup to overthrow the Government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.\" The agency \"represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.\" \"Whatever else these passages disclose, t hey most certainly establish that representatives of other Executive branches have expanded their war against the CIA from the inner government councils to the American people via the press. And published simultaneously are details of the agency's operatio ns in Vietnam that can come only from the same critical official sources. This is disorderly government. And the longer the President tolerates it — the period already is considerable — the greater the real war against the Vietcong and the impression of a very indecisive Administration in Washington. \"The CIA may be guilty as charged. Since it cannot, or at any rate will not, openly defend its record in Vietnam or defend it by the same confidential press 'briefings' employed by its critics, the public is not in a"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"[114] Final Judgment 175 position to judge. Nor to this department, which sought and failed to get even the outlines of the agency's case in rebuttal. \"But Mr. Kennedy will have to make a judgment if the spectacle of war within the Executive branch is to be ended and the effe ctive functioning of the CIA preserved. And when he makes this judgment, hopefully he also will make it public, as well as the appraisal of fault on which it is based. \"Doubtless recommendations as to what his judgment should be were made to him today by S ecretary of Defense McNamara and General Taylor on their return from their fact - finding expedition into the embattled official jungle in Saigon.\" 309 It is ironic, indeed, that Krock's column concluded with its reference to the trip by McNamara and Taylor to Southeast Asia. For, as Col. Fletcher Prouty points out, upon their return they \"reported to the President that it looked to them, after their visit to Saigon, as though things could be put under control and that we would be able to withdraw all person nel [from Vietnam] by the end of 1965. \"Now we can see why they chose that date,\" comments Prouty. \"This was the date the President had used in his own discussions with his closest advisers. They all knew that he planned to announce a pullout once he had b een re - elected.\" 310 It was soon thereafter, however, that John F. Kennedy was indeed gone from the scene and the president's plans for withdrawal from Vietnam, so carefully drawn, were now being reversed by the new President. THE CIA PREVAILS In his boo k Plausible Denial, Mark Lane summarizes the events which occurred: \"Just four days after the death of President Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson signed NSAM 273 that began to reverse the policy of withdrawal from Vietnam and signified the beginning of the escalati on of the conflict. The CIA had prevailed. The effort in Southeast Asia was to become a massive land - based war.\" \"During March, 1964, Johnson signed NSAM 288 that repudiated Kennedy's plan to end the U.S. military participation in the war that year. In the months that followed, Johnson increased the military commitment from under 20,000 troops to approximately a quarter of a million.\" 311 \"Years later . . . after the deaths of more than 50,000 Americans and more than a million Vietnamese, Laotians, and Camb odians, the war finally ended with the military defeat of the United States. \" 312 However, as we have seen in Chapter 6, the war in Vietnam proved a boon to the CIA's allies in Israel, allowing the Middle East state to flex its muscles in the region. And i n Chapter 12 we shall see that a joint CIA - Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate venture in the international drug racket out of Southeast Asia proved so very profitable, conducted under military cover in the midst of U.S. involvement in Vietnam."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"176 A Little Unpleasantness [115] TH E CIA AND TH E J FK ASSASSINATIO N It was not until the release of Plausible Denial that the extent of the CIA's involvement in the JFK assassination was fully outlined. Suspicion of the CIA's complicity was commonplace over the years, but Lane's book proved the matter on ce and for all. And, significantly, his book was a written summation of a libel trial in Miami some years previously in which the jury had concluded that the CIA had indeed been involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up. The circumstances o f how the trial came about are interesting. It was in 1978, that a Washington - based weekly newspaper, The Spotlight, published an article by former high - ranking CIA official Victor Marchetti which alleged the CIA intended to frame longtime CIA operative E. Howard Hunt for involvement in the Kennedy assassination. Hunt, of course, was the CIA's chief political liaison with the anti - Castro Cuban community during the period leading up to the JFK assassination and who had, subsequently, over the years, been men tioned as a suspect in the assassination conspiracy. (Hunt had organized, on the CIA's behalf, several anti - Castro Cuban groups, including the Revolutionary Democratic Front. Hunt's Cuban point man in the RDF, Antonio de Varona, in fact, personally receive d funding for the RDF from Meyer Lansky himself.) 313 Marchetti's article suggested that there was then so much growing suspicion that the CIA had been involved in the JFK assassination that the CIA had decided that it would sacrifice Hunt and say that Hun t was a \"renegade\" operative involved in the president's assassination. HUNT A FREE - LANCE OPERATIVE? However, according to Marchetti, the CIA intended to say that Hunt and his co - conspirators had been operating independently — that the CIA as an institutio n had not been part of the conspiracy. Although the editors of The Spotlight felt Marchetti's article served, if anything, as an advance warning to Hunt about what his former employers had in mind, the ex - CIA man decided to sue, even though he ultimately a dmitted under oath that he believed The Spotlight's story seemed plausible. When the case finally went to trial in federal court in Miami, the newspaper suffered a devastating loss. The jury found in favor of Hunt and ordered The Spotlight to pay $650,000 in damages. Fortunately — for The Spotlight — an error in the trial judge's instructions to the jury gave the populist weekly grounds for an appeal. When the case was successfully appealed and ordered for retrial, Mark Lane — an attorney — stepped in for the defen se. Among the big names deposed during the Hunt case were: former CIA Director Richard Helms; former CIA Director Stansfield Turner; former CIA chief for the Western Hemisphere David Phillips; and former CIA and FBI man (and Watergate celebrity) G. Gordon Liddy. The most damning"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"[116] Final Judgment 177 evidence against Hunt came, however, when attorney Lane presented the deposition of former CIA operative Marita Lorenz H U N T , S T U R G I S A N D R U B Y I N DA L L A S Miss Lorenz testified that one day prior to the president's assassination sh e arrived in Dallas (traveling from a CIA \"safe house\" in Miami) in a two - car caravan. Accompanying Miss Lorenz on what she described as a secret mission were several CIA operatives, led by Miss Lorenz' CIA \"handler,\" Frank Sturgis, armed with telescopic r ifles. According to Miss Lorenz she had not been apprised of the purpose of the mission. Upon arrival in Dallas, according to Miss Lorenz, they met with not only E. Howard Hunt, who was functioning as the CIA operatives' paymaster, but also nightclub opera tor Jack Ruby who later executed the president's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. When Hunt himself took the stand, attorney Lane, while questioning Hunt, pointed out numerous inconsistencies in Hunt's testimony. Hunt himself had told several stories, over the years, about where he had been on the day the president was assassinated. It was Miss Lorenz' testimony, however, that convinced the jury that the CIA had been involved in the Kennedy assassination. The jury found in favor of The Spotlight and dis missed Hunt's claim. Leslie Armstrong, a Miami resident who was jury forewoman in the case, issued a statement in conjunction with the release of Lane's written account of the trial: \"Mr. Lane was asking us [the jury] to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe John Kennedy had been killed by our own government. Yet when we examined the evidence closely, we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.\" 314 In his best - selling Plausible Denial Lane recounted th is exciting trial and demonstrated other compelling evidence that he uncovered which proves that the CIA did indeed have a hand in the president's assassination But in Chapter 16 of Final Judgment we will look more closely at the activities of both E. Howa rd Hunt and Frank Sturgis, examining remarkable evidence which points further toward the involvement of the Mossad — alongside the CIA — in the JFK assassination conspiracy. THE NOVO BROTHERS But there are other interesting connections, in the meantime, that should be explored. Lane has described how Miss Lorenz had gone even further in her testimony, naming other CIA operatives who had been in the two - car caravan organized by Frank Sturgis in which Lorenz traveled from Miami to Dallas. According to Lane, \"Be fore Miss Lorenz testified, I asked her, Will you tell me the names of the people who traveled with you in that two - car caravan?'"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"178 A Little Unpleasantness [117] \"She said that she wouldn't name names. 'That could get me killed,' she said. 'Don't ask me that question. I want you to pro mise me that you won't ask me that question.' However, \" according to Lane, \"Mr. Hunt's lawyer asked her that question and she answered it, to my surprise. She said that it was the Novo brothers.\" According to Lane, \"The Novo brothers — Guillermo and Ignacio — are very interesting characters. I've done some research on them. I can assure you,\" said Lane, \"that the first time I heard their name connected with the Kennedy assassination was when Miss Lorenz gave their names to Hunt's lawyer. She had not told me an ything before that. \"After her testimony to Hunt's lawyer, I asked Miss Lorenz, 'Why did you tell them?' She said — referring to Hunt, the CIA and his lawyers — `If they are so dumb as to ask me that question, then it is not my fault if I give them the answer . It's on their heads,’ said Miss Lorenz. `If you had asked me, it would have been a different story. However, if the CIA — through Hunt and his lawyers — asked that question, then it's on the record and it's their fault, not mine. ’\" THE HUNT - BUCKLEY CONNECTI ON \"These Novo brothers that Miss Lorenz named have been involved in a series of intelligence related crimes. They were involved in the murder in Washington, D.C. in 1976 of former Chilean government official Orlando Letelier and Ronnie Moffit, a woman wh o was with him. A man named Michael Townley who was connected with the Chilean secret police was involved in planning the Letelier murder with the Novo brothers. When Townley was indicted, he testified against the Novos. \"Townley was questioned by the FBI who asked Townley to show them where in New York City he had his first meeting with the Novos. Townley pointed out a building at 500 Fifth Avenue and showed the FBI the office on the 41st floor where the first meeting was held.\" 315 According to Lane, rese arch indicated that the meeting was held in the office of then - U.S. Sen. James Buckley (C - N.Y.). Now a federal judge on the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Buckley is the brother of former CIA operative and conservative fortnig htly National Review founder William F. Buckley, Jr. (E. Howard Hunt was William F. Buckley's immediate superior in the CIA during the period that the two served together in the CIA in Mexico for nine months in the period of 1951 - 52.) According to Lane, \"T he testimony by Townley made reference to a William Sampol who worked in James Buckley's office. Sampol was a cousin of the Novo brothers.\" 316 Lane points out that the murder of Letelier took place during the time that George Bush was director of the CIA: \"There is evidence that Bush was given information that indicated that the Chilean government was responsible for the murder of Letelier. However, Bush gave information to"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"[118] Final Judgment 179 selected friends in the news media the story that Letelier was killed by his own s upporters who wanted to make him [Letelier] a martyr. According to Lane, \"It was William F. Buckley, Jr. who took that story from Bush and ran with it. The media followed Buckley's lead, but the story turned out not to be true.\" (In Chapter 20, as we shall see, it was George Bush who, in many ways, had very close connections to a number of the key players in the strange netherworld of international intelligence as it is linked to the JFK assassination.) As Lane points out: \"The Novos were both convicted of the Letelier murder and sentenced to prison. These are the brothers that Marita Lorenz testified were in the two - car caravan of killers traveling from Miami to Dallas for the purpose of assassinating President Kennedy.\" 317 MULTIPLE MOSSAD CONNECTIONS Ev idence now available from former Mossad operative Victor Ostrovsky suggests that Israel's Mossad, in fact, was indirectly connected with the Letelier assassination for which the Novo brothers (implicated in the JFK assassination) were later convicted. (It was Ostrovsky, coincidentally enough, whom we learned in Chapter 2, had exposed a Mossad plot to assassinate the former director of the CIA, George Bush, after Bush, serving as U.S. President, ran afoul of Israel.) According to Ostrovsky, commenting on the Letelier murder: \"Nobody pointed the finger at the Mossad. And while the Mossad had no direct involvement in the hit ordered by Chilean DINA [secret police] Chief Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, it had played a significant indirect role in the execution throu gh a secret deal with Contreras to buy a French - made Exocet surface - to - surface naval missile from Chile. \"The death squad didn't use Mossad personnel in killing Letelier but they certainly used Mossad know - how, taught to them as part of the deal Contreras made to supply the missile.\" 318 It was the Novo brothers, however, who took the fall and served time in prison. No Mossad agents, however, were charged with the crime. It is interesting to note, nonetheless, that Michael Townley himself had very interesti ng further connections with Israel. His wife, Ines, although a Chilean Christian, had spent time on an Israeli Kibbutz with her first husband, and maintained a long - standing \"devotion to the cause of Israel.\" 319 Part of Townley's deal with the federal pro secutors, in the case of the Novo brothers, involved a plea bargain in which his wife received immunity from prosecution, although she had been implicated in various terrorist enterprises alongside her husband. 320 However, Townley's other connection with Israel is far more significant, particularly in the context of our discussion of his connection with the Cuban Americans who have been implicated in the JFK assassination. During Townley's long career as an international adventurer, he served — apparently du ring the period from 1961 - 1966 — as a mutual funds salesman for financier Bernard Cornfeld's Investors' Overseas Service (JOS)"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"180 A Little Unpleasantness [119] 321 It was in Chapter 7 that we first came across the IOS, in examining the relationship of Meyer Lansky's Organized Crime Syndic ate to the Israeli Mossad - linked Banque De Credit International (BCI). TIBOR ROSENBAUM'S PROTEGE During the criminal trial in 1970 of one of Lansky's Florida lieutenants, Alvin Malnik, it was publicly revealed that one of the key money laundering channel s for the illegal proceeds of Lansky's narcotics, vice and gambling rackets was BCI, the brainchild of the Israeli Mossad's former Director - General for Finance and Supply, Tibor Rosenbaum Rosenbaum's BCI received its Lansky Crime Syndicate cash flow mainly through the Lansky - controlled Bank of World Commerce in Nassau, Bahamas. The middleman was a young Swiss, Sylvain Ferdmann, a courier for Lansky. Ferdmann was not only an official of Rosenbaum's bank, and an associate of the Bank of World Commerce (contro lled by Lansky's longtime crony, John Pullman) but — like Michael Townley himself — also a legman for Investors Overseas Services (IOS). Townley's employer, Cornfeld, in fact, was initially sponsored by Rosenbaum who had emerged as a major money launderer for Lansky's global drug trafficking. Millions in small bills were transferred from Lansky's casinos, often masked as Israeli Bond sales and contributions to Jewish philanthropies through BCI and the IOS. It is thus interesting, to say the least, that Michael Townley, with his Israeli Mossad connections during not only the period of the JFK assassination but also during his participation in the Letelier murder, should be associated with the Novo brothers who have been implicated in both crimes themselves. That former New York Senator James Buckley's office should have, perhaps by coincidence, served as the meeting place where the Letelier assassination was planned is also interesting. As we've noted already, E. Howard Hunt (himself implicated in the JFK assassin ation) and Buckley's brother, publisher (and Hunt's ex - CIA support staffer) William F. Buckley, Jr. were longtime friends stemming from their CIA days. Hunt's own longtime intrigue with the Cuban American community in anti - Castro activities as the CIA's ch ief liaison with the Cubans, of course, has long been widely noted. THE BUCKLEY - ISRAEL CONNECTION However, what is not so widely known is that the Buckley family — including brothers James and William — had substantive links to Israel through their various f amily oil enterprises. In 1971 the Washington Observer newsletter shed some interesting light on the Buckley family oil concessions in Israel, established by Buckley's father."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"[120] Final Judgment 181 Buckley, Sr. incorporated Pan - Israel Oil Co (headquartered in Jerusalem) with Buckley, Sr. as president. Directors of the company included several Israelis. Simultaneously, Israel - Mediterranean Petroleum, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Panama. The principal offices of the firm were in Jerusalem at the same address where Pan - Israel Oil Co. was located. James L. Buckley was one of the vice presidents. All of the voting stock for the two companies was held in the voting trust. No members of the Buckley family, however, held votes. The voting trustees had Jewish names. Pan - Israe l and Israel - Mediterranean jointly owned eight petroleum licenses, all located in Israel. The two companies also owned Mana Oil Distributors and Tri - Continent Drilling Co., a subsidiary of the Pantepec Oil Company (later absorbed by Pantepec International Petroleum, Ltd.). President of PIP, Ltd. was John W. Buckley who, with his brother James L. Buckley, served on the board of directors. These companies, together conducted global operations with oil properties in Australia, South America, Canada, Libya, Spa nish Sahara, the Philippines and Israel. 322 That the Hunt - and CIA - linked Buckley family should also be so closely tied to the Novo brothers, implicated in both the JFK and Orlando Letelier assassinations is intriguing. More so, perhaps, because the Novo brothers' associate in the Letelier assassination — at least — was himself intimately tied to the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and an Israeli Mossad - sponsored money laundering operation. Incredibly enough, however, there is yet another bizarre Buckle y family link to a key player in the strange world of JFK's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the JFK assassination conspiracy. THE BUCKLEY - DeMOHRENSCHILDT CONNECTION This link came in the person of the colorful Russian nobleman, George DeMohrensc hildt, who befriended Oswald upon the young American's return from exile (some would say \"CIA service\") in the Soviet Union. DeMohrenschildt, who is reputed to have worked for various international intelligence agencies, had a long - standing relationship wi th the CIA, dating back to the days of the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), in which, incidentally, E. Howard Hunt himself had served. 323 The European nobleman, however, traveled around the globe primarily in his capacity as an o il engineer. It was in this guise that he came into contact with the Buckley family. As early as 1945 DeMohrenschildt worked directly under Warren Smith, then the president of the Pantepec Oil Co., the B u c k l e y f a m i l y ' s M e x i c a n o i l c o m p a n y , e s t a b l i s h e d i n 1 9 1 4 . DeMohrenschildt and Smith eventually formed the Cuban - Venezuelan Oil Trust Co. The Buckley Family's Pantepec, interestingly enough, had, by that time, already shifted its focus to Venezuela. 324"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"182 A Little Unpleasantness [121] Despite all these more tenuous Buckley links, there i s, however, firm evidence of a link between the Buckleys and DeMohrenschildt. It turns out that in DeMohrenschildt's address book is listed one \"Buckley, W.F.\" 325 DeMOHRENSCHILDT AND HUNT DeMohrenschildt's career also seems to have intersected on a regul ar basis with that of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s friend and CIA mentor, E. Howard Hunt. Both Hunt and DeMohrenschildt had worked for the Agency for International Development (AID); Hunt for the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), a subsidiary of AID and DeMohrenschildt in the late 1950's for the International Cooperation Administration, the AID subsidiary which was the successor to the ECA. Hunt and DeMohrenschildt also both popped up in Cuba in 1956 in the stormy period before Fidel Castro pushed the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate off the island. While DeMohrenschildt said later that he was there on oil business, Hunt was attending a meeting of CIA station chiefs from the Caribbean and Central American regions. In 1960 both Hunt and DeMohrensc hildt also appeared in Guatemala when troops were being trained there for what was ultimately to be the Bay of Pigs debacle, initially intended for the purpose of toppling Castro. DeMohrenschildt said that he and his wife were on a walking tour of Central America. Hunt, however, was serving as the CIA's liaison with anti - Castro Cuban groups. 326 By 1963, however, DeMohrenschildt had settled in Dallas and had befriended Lee Harvey Oswald who by this time, was mixing easily with the anti - Castro Cuban elements that were directly under the thumb of the CIA's chief liaison with those forces — E. Howard Hunt. The role of DeMohrenschildt in the JFK assassination conspiracy will probably never be known. In the end, the globe - hopping nobleman died (ostensibly by his ow n hand) on the morning of March 29, 1977 just shortly before he was scheduled to meet with an investigator of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. DeMohrenschildt's wife believed her husband’s suicide had somehow been induced. Whatever the case, t here is yet another bizarre coincidence, DeMohrenschildt had just met — before his death — with author Edward Jay Epstein. In Chapter 8, as we saw, it was Epstein who was the primary literary promoter of the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald was under Soviet influ ence when he assassinated John F. Kennedy. The primary source for Epstein's theory was Israel's CIA ally, James Jesus Angleton. THE CIA AND THE OAS It was during the same period of JFK' s war with the CIA that the CIA was actively engaged in an effort to topple French President Charles DeGaulle, lending aid and support to the Israeli - backed French Secret Army"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"[122] Final Judgment 183 Organization (OAS) that was fighting DeGaulle's decision to grant independence to Algeria. Although the Church Senate Committee hearings on clande stine CIA activities later concluded that there had been no CIA involvement with the OAS, 327 there is very strong evidence to the contrary. General Maurice Challe, former commander in chief of French forces in Algeria and leader of the military revolt agai nst DeGaulle in April of 1961, emerged as one of the key figures in the OAS. Although Challe insisted that he \"'had no contact personally with any foreign countries' and that in fact he had deliberately avoided all such contacts so as not to incur any poss ible charge of having been brought in on foreign bayonets. \"Nevertheless,\" according to historian Alistair Horne, \"some of [Challe's] subordinates appear to have made informal, and highly tentative, soundings with representatives of various countries that might be considered sympathetic, among them Portugal, Spain, Israel and South Africa.\" 328 \"Rumors of clandestine United States involvement ran extremely strong in France. Undeniably, during his time at NATO headquarters the popular Challe did make firm fri ends of a number of high - ranking United States generals who made no secret of their aversion to what DeGaulle was doing to NATO, going so far — over a plethora of Scotch — as to express enthusiasm for anyone who might rid France of her turbulent president, or, at least, force him to change his tune.\" 329 \"There were also rumors that the CIA had promised Challe United States recognition if they succeeded — in order to keep the communists out of North Africa. Any hopes, however, that all this may have engendered in the bosom of the conspiracy were to be swiftly dashed when [John F. Kennedy's] Ambassador to Paris, General James M. Gavin, firmly assured DeGaulle that if any rebels attempted to land on French bases where there were American troops, these would at once o pen fire.\" 330 There is further evidence that the CIA was engaged in intrigue with the OAS. According to historian Alexander Harrison, \"In early December 1961, a 'Colonel Brown' of the CIA station in France requested a meeting with [OAS leader General Raou l] Salan. Brown offered Salan enough weaponry to equip an army of 50,000 men.\" 331 Although some have speculated that the purported CIA operatives were not, in fact, really with the CIA, General Salan himself said, \"I was sure they were serious, because the y knew all the right people, and their credentials were perfect.\" In fact, in the end, some arms were indeed delivered. 332 So there really is no question, really, that the CIA was indeed covertly supporting the OAS in its war against DeGaulle. We do know t hat during this same time frame, the CIA did have one liaison, at least, to the OAS. He was E. Howard Hunt, the agency's political handler for the anti - Castro Cuban exiles. In Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 we will examine Hunt's OAS connections further, partic ularly as they relate to the key players involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"184 A Little Unpleasantness [123] T H E O A S A N D ' I S R A EL ' S F R I E N D S I N F R A NC E ' One of the few American conservatives to recognize the strange dynamics between DeGaulle and the CIA was Dan Smoot, who comme nted perceptively as early as 1958 that: \"In the current liberal - internationalist smear of DeGaulle, the lefties hammer that DeGaulle is anti - American; but they never tell why.\" 333 He pointed out that DeGaulle was angry about CIA support for the anti - DeGau lle left in France, and commented that largely DeGaulle was more, instead \"anti - CIA, which is something else again.\" 334 He added, \"The New York Times was almost hysterical about DeGaulle coming to power — You can understand why.\" 335 In fact, during this ti me of CIA intrigue against DeGaulle, it is worth noting that the aforementioned OAS leaders — Salan and Challe — among many others \"were known as Israel's friends in France,\" 336 according to Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi. Ultimately, Israel rewarde d Challe for his efforts. After Challe was released from prison in 1967, having been convicted of his involvement in attempting to topple DeGaulle, Challe was hired by Zim, the Israeli shipping concern, 337 part of the international corporate empire of on e of the Mossad's most valued assets, billionaire Shaul Eisenberg, whose enterprises were an integral part of the economy of the state of Israel itself. We first met Eisenberg in Chapter 7 where we learned of his partnership, along with Mossad officer Tibo r Rosenbaum, in the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank. But we will learn much more about Eisenberg and his ventures on behalf of Israel's drive for a nuclear arsenal later in these pages. More importantly, however, we will see how Eisenberg's activities tie directly into the JFK assassination — a story that has never been told before. That Israel and its allies in the CIA would be conspiring against Charles DeGaulle during the same period when they were likewise conspiring against John F. Kennedy, as we shall see, is q uite significant indeed. THREE POWERFUL FORCES All of these connections illustrate the cycle which continually links key players in the international intrigue between not only the CIA and the Israeli Mossad, but also the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Synd icate — three powerful forces all of which desired the removal of John F.

It was Lee Harvard Oswald's pathetic cry, \"I'm just a patsy,\" that has become immortalized. Ironically, though, one of the most widely alleged JFK assassin ation masterminds — New Orleans' widely - publicized supposed \"crime boss\" — might himself be able to make that same claim. We are speaking, of course, of the colorful Carlos Marcello — nicknamed \"Little Man\" — a sobriquet he happened to share with Meyer Lansky. BL AMING MARCELLO One book, John W. Davis's Mafia Kingfish: Carlos Marcello and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, names Marcello as the likely mastermind of the JFK murder. Standing alone, with no further evidence such as that we have cited in the pages of Final Judgment, in this chapter and elsewhere, Davis' contention seems reasonable. But, as we've said, his conclusions are not based on the totality of all the evidence available to those who are interested in the big picture. DISTORTING THE TRUTH Dav id Scheim, writing in Contract on America: The Mafia Murder of President John F. Kennedy, likewise blames \"the Mafia\" for the JFK assassination and also points the finger at Carlos Marcello in particular. For whatever reason, however, Scheim is devoted to underplaying (even ignoring) the critical role of Meyer Lansky in the underworld. In Scheim's view, Lansky was little more than a bit player — this in direct contradiction to even standard histories of organized crime which, by virtue of reality, are forced to recognize Lansky's particular influence."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"186 Little Man’s Little Man [125] Scheim, in fact, goes to great lengths to suggest that Lansky was of little consequence in the whole scheme of things. He writes: \"The late syndicate financier Meyer Lansky could take no action without the appr oval of Mafia superiors.\" 33 8 This is simply not true in any sense whatsoever. That Scheim even suggests this indicates that he is determined to ignore the entire picture. Scheim notes, incorrectly, that Lansky's alleged \"Mafia superiors\" kept him under con stant surveillance through one Jimmy \"Blue Eyes\" Alo whom Scheim describes as a \"caporegime\" in the Genovese Mafia family out of New York. 339 Alo was indeed closely associated with Lansky, but, in fact, was not only a close personal friend, but also a wor king partner. He was not, contrary to Scheim's bizarre concoction, a Mafia handler of Meyer Lansky. CLAY SHAW AND THE CIA Scheim's own determination to ignore the role of the intelligence community in the JFK assassination conspiracy — particularly that of the CIA — is also interesting. In his book Scheim goes to great lengths to portray New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison as a tool of the Mafia and an associate of Carlos Marcello. He also comes down hard on Garrison's investigation of international bu sinessman Clay Shaw. According to Scheim, \"Equally bizarre was Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw, who became his prime culprit. A retired director of the New Orleans International Trade Mart, Shaw was a soft - spoken liberal who devoted most of his time to restoring homes in the Old French Quarter.\" 340 What Scheim fails to note — and what he could not miss inasmuch as he is self - portrayed as a longtime JFK assassination researcher — is that Shaw was, indeed, involved with the CIA. IGNORING THE FACTS This was a fact well known among JFK assassination researchers at the time Scheim's book went to press. There is simply no rational excuse for Scheim's deliberate deletion of this critical fact. Be that as it may, in Chapter 15 we shall examine Shaw's central posi tioning in the conspiracy that involved not only the CIA and the Mafia and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate, but also Israel's Mossad. Obviously, in order to perpetuate the myth that \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" Scheim is forced to avoid the facts tha t damage his thesis. And this is precisely what he has done. Scheim's own book (and the aforementioned work by John W. Davis) both rely heavily on a previously - released work, The Plot to Kill the President: Organized Crime Assassinated JFK by G. Robert Bla key and Richard N. Billings. (Scheim's book, in fact, is hardly more than a re - write of much of the same material and, actually, constitutes little more than a history of the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"[126] Final Judgment 187 Mafia, available in many standard sources. Scheim's book, all in all, fails mis erably in its attempt to lay the blame anywhere for that matter. (And in light of the facts that we are uncovering in the pages of Final Judgment it is probably worth noting that Scheim's publisher, Shapolsky Publishers, is an affiliate of an Israeli - owned company — a fact that could perhaps have something to do with the decision to promote a book pinning the assassination of JFK on \"the Mafia.\") That Scheim and Davis relied upon the Blakey/Billings work is unfortunate, particularly since this book comes from what can only be charitably described as suspect sources. Blakey, of course, was director of the House Assassinations Committee which concluded that there had probably been a conspiracy behind the president's assassination and that, more than likely, elem ents of the \"Mafia\" may have been been involved. SABOTAGING GARRISON Richard Billings, who served alongside Blakey in the House Committee investigation, was no stranger to the JFK assassination conspiracy. In fact, Billings had been the Life magazine edi tor who led a team from his magazine to New Orleans ostensibly to collaborate with then District Attorney Jim Garrison in his investigation into the JFK murder. Garrison notes, however, that Life, instead, did just the opposite. Life ran several major arti cles which linked Garrison to organized crime — to the Mafia — to Carlos Marcello, specifically, thereby discrediting Garrison to many who believed the tales. 341 As a consequence when Blakey and Billings teamed up to write the book based on their experiences w ith the House Assassinations Committee, they reserved harsh criticism for Garrison and suggested that he was pointing the finger, wrongly, at the intelligence community and, in effect covering up for Marcello's involvement in the crime. Billings, it also j ust happens, was an in - law of C. D. Jackson, the publisher of Life magazine whom investigative journalist Carl Bernstein has described as \"[Life owner] Henry Luce's personal emissary to the CIA.\" 342 Billings also — perhaps not coincidentally — played a recurri ng role in Life's coverage of CIA - backed Cuban exile raids on Castro's Cuba. ORGANIZED CRIME 'EXPERT' So it was that Blakey and Billings' work put much emphasis on Marcello as having been one of the prime movers in the conspiracy. Yet, Blakey's allegatio ns about the role of \"the Mafia\" can only be described as suspect, to say the very least. There's much more to the story as we will see. A professor of law and the director of the Notre Dame University Institute on Organized Crime, Blakey is often loudly t rumpeted by the media as one of the nation's leading authorities on \"the Mafia.\" Previously a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 Little Man’s Little Man [127] special prosecutor in the Justice Department under then - Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Blakey is the author of the famous Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Org anizations (RICO) statute that has become a major tool in federal organized crime prosecutions. Thus it is that Blakey's conclusions about the role of \"the Mafia\" (and specifically Carlos Marcello) in the JFK assassination conspiracy have received widespre ad recognition and credibility. However, just two years before he was named director of the House Assassinations Committee, Blakey had a different relationship with organized crime: he had been on the payroll of a top figure in the Lansky Syndicate. BLAKE Y'S LANSKY CONNECTION After Penthouse magazine had published an article alleging that the La Costa Country Club in Carlsbad, California was linked to the underworld, several of La Costa's founders filed a lawsuit against Penthouse. One of the plaintiffs i n the La Costa case was Morris \"Moe\" Dalitz, a former Detroit and Cleveland bootlegger - turned - Las Vegas casino boss, who had long - standing and close personal and business ties with Meyer Lansky. Brought in as part of Dalitz's legal team was Robert Blakey h imself. This was certainly an unusual position for a self - promoted \"crime fighter\" such as Blakey. The longtime crime fighter, in fact, provided an affidavit on Dalitz's behalf against Penthouse. 343 Blakey's employer Dalitz was very much an integral part of the Lansky Syndicate. In Chapter 4 we learned that it was the notorious \"Purple Gang\" in Detroit that had put out a contract on the life of Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the future president, during Prohibition for interfering in their \"territ ory.\" Kennedy, as we saw, made contact with Chicago Mafia chieftain Sam Giancana who intervened on the elder Kennedy's behalf, convincing the Purple Gang to cancel the proposed \"hit.\" At that time, in fact, one of the key leaders of the Purple Gang was non e other than Moe Dalitz, an up - and - coming mob figure. DALITZ, SIEGEL AND LANSKY According to FBI organized crime expert William Roemer, \"Moe Dalitz started his criminal career way back in the Prohibition Era. He had been one of the admirals in 'the Littl e Jewish Navy' in Detroit when, as a rum - runner, he ferried booze across the Detroit River from Canada to quench the thirst of the many Motor City citizens who were eager to taste the whiskey, wine, and beer forbidden by the 'Noble Experiment.'\" 344 This wa s the beginning of a long, lasting, close working relationship between Lansky, \"the chairman of the board of organized crime\" and Morris Dalitz. In fact, according to Roemer, it was Dalitz who was the prime mover behind the Syndicate's move against Benjami n \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Lansky's boyhood friend and fellow racketeer who was shot dead in 1947."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"[128] Final Judgment 189 According to Roemer, it was Lansky who sent Dalitz to Las Vegas to inquire into the activities of Ben Siegel. Dalitz, reports Roemer, \"was the main contributor to t he growing opinion that everything was not on the up and up. His report was the major reason why Lansky, [Frank] Costello, et al, made their report to the [organized crime] assembly in Havana in December 1946 and later in June when it was finally decided t o chop Bugsy.\" 345 In Chapter 13 we shall review the Lansky - Siegel connection further and examine the bizarre role that the colorful thug, Mickey Cohen, Siegel's successor as Lansky's West Coast henchman, played in Israel's intrigues against JFK and in the JFK assassination conspiracy. In fact, as a direct consequence of Seigel's assassination, Dalitz stepped in as Lansky's official liaison in Las Vegas, becoming the so - called \"godfather of Las Vegas.\" However, it would be nearly thirty years later that Robe rt Blakey, the chief proponent of the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" would end up on Morris Dalitz's team, proclaiming Dalitz innocent of any mob connections and directing attention away from any direct Lansky connections to the JFK assassination consp iracy. Unfortunately for Blakey, Dalitz and La Costa, Penthouse prevailed and beat back their libel suit and, in effect, repudiated Blakey's character reference on behalf of Dalitz and his associates. So it was that the chief proponent of the theory that \" the Mafia Killed JFK\" had lined up in defense of one of Meyer Lansky's closest associates — Moe Dalitz, a legendary figure in the underworld himself. Some seven months after Blakey and the House Assassinations Committee issued their report that \"The Mafia Ki lled JFK\" — a report that carefully and studiously ignored Lansky's high - level influence over \"the Mafia\" — the Wall Street Journal reported in September of 1979 that Dalitz had long been identified by federal authorities as an ongoing senior advisor to organi zed crime. 346 This time Dalitz did not bring a libel suit. ISRAEL HONORS DALITZ Dalitz' public image, however, did not suffer as a consequence of the Penthouse victory in the libel suit or as a result of the report in the Wall Street Journal. Instead, in 1983 the aging mob figure and Las Vegas \"philanthropist\" was honored by the pro - Israel Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith with its prestigious \"Torch of Liberty Award.\" Evidently the ADL did not see any problem with giving its highest honor to o ne of the top leaders of organized crime. Dalitz's service to the cause of Israel was apparently deemed more significant than his activities in the underworld. And Dalitz was indeed an active supporter of Israel's cause. In fact, Dalitz himself was the key mid - West contact for the Sonneborn Institute — the Israeli arms smuggling entity — that we first encountered in Chapter 7 where we examined the long - standing ties of the Lansky Syndicate to Israel. So we can certainly understand why the ADL would be so eager to award Dalitz for his services."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190 Little Man’s Little Man [129] In Chapter 17 we shall examine the immense influence that the ADL itself has on the American news media. We shall also see one instance of how a longtime ADL collaborator floated a \"new\" theory about the JFK assassinatio n — a widely - publicized cover story that seems to have been orchestrated by Israel's friends at the CIA. For his own part, Dalitz's defender, Robert Blakey, clearly prefers to look at the Italian elements of the underworld, but no further. As we saw in Chapt er 7 (and which we will discuss further in this chapter and elsewhere) the differences between \"the Mafia\" and organized crime as a whole are far more profound that Blakey would allow us to imagine. BLAKEY AND THE CIA Blakey, likewise, has refused to ack nowledge the role of American intelligence, specifically the CIA, in the JFK assassination. No wonder then that prominent JFK assassination researchers such as Mark Lane, writing in Plausible Denial, and Jim Marrs, writing in Crossfire — among many others — ha ve commented critically on Blakey's close relationship with the CIA during the period of the House Assassinations Committee investigation. In his own book, Conspiracy, Anthony Summers documents — in frightening detail — the CIA's subversion of the House invest igation which, it appears, was aided and abetted by Blakey himself Blakey himself did nothing to allay the suspicions of his critics by first clearing his own book with the CIA. The concluding paragraph of Blakey's book — which another JFK assassination rese archer, Carl Oglesby, caustically remarked should have appeared on the opening pages rather than buried at the end of the book — read as follows: \"Pursuant to agreement with the Select Committee on Assassinations, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Fede ral Bureau of Investigation reviewed this book in manuscript form to determine that the classified information it contained had been properly released for publication and that no informant was identified. Neither the CIA nor the FBI warrants the factual ma terial or endorses the views expressed.\" 347 Thus, while Blakey was busy pointing the finger at Carlos Marcello and away from the CIA and its allies in the Israeli Mossad, the facts about the Lansky - Marcello relationship belie Blakey's claim that \"the Mafi a\" was the driving force in the JFK assassination conspiracy. LOUISIANA FRONT MAN The fact remains that whatever role Carlos Marcello or any of his underlings played in either the JFK assassination or the cover - up, Marcello was nothing more than a front - man for the \"boss of all bosses\" — Israel's longtime patron, Meyer Lansky himself. Marcello was indeed, Little Man's Little Man. Lansky was, in fact, much, much bigger — in terms of power and influence — than Carlos Marcello would ever be, Marcello's fame and re putation notwithstanding."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"[130] Final Judgment 191 To understand the fatal flaws in the Davis, Scheim, Blakey - Billings theories — and to underscore the thesis of Final Judgment — it is vital to remember this all - important fact. Interestingly, Davis himself makes clear that Marcello was, in fact, a protégé of Lansky. The author does not, however, place the significant emphasis on Lansky's superiority over Marcello that must be made in presenting any theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" For the full story of the Lansky - Marcello relation ship we are indebted to Hank Messick, the fearless investigative reporter who specialized in Organized Crime coverage. In his biography of Meyer Lansky, Messick described how Lansky picked Marcello out of relative obscurity and set up Louisiana's supposed \"Mafia boss\" in business. Messick told how Lansky (through his partner and longtime associate Frank Costello) first moved into Louisiana. Under heat from New York reform Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Lansky and Costello had decided that New Orleans was an idea l location to relocate their slot machine operations. Costello met in New York with then - Louisiana Governor Huey Long who agreed to open up his state to Organized Crime. Lansky - Costello associate \"Dandy Phil\" Kastel was sent in to take charge of the projec t. However, it was Lansky himself who went to New Orleans to cut the final deal with Long. The two met at the Roosevelt Hotel which was owned by a mutual crony, Seymour Weiss. 348 (This was not the first meeting between Lansky and Long, however. The two ha d first met at the 1932 Democratic Convention in Chicago which nominated then - New York Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt for president. It was during that brokered convention that Lansky bribes, along with Long's support, enabled FDR to win his party's no mination. Lansky's longtime associate and primary link to the Italian underworld, Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, described that momentous meeting in his historic posthumously - published memoirs.) 349 THE LONG - LANSKY DEAL It was during their second fateful meeti ng that Long and Lansky cut a deal which sealed their fates irrevocably and which, in fact, ultimately led to Long's untimely demise at the hands of an assassin. Here was the deal: in return for allowing Lansky's syndicate to operate in Louisiana, Long agr eed to take a $20,000 monthly kickback. Lansky's slot machines were installed by a company chartered for \"charitable contributions.\" However, out of the first $800,000 made by Lansky and his cronies in New Orleans, widows and orphans got exactly $600. 350 This cozy arrangement between Lansky's Organized Crime syndicate and Huey Long's powerful Louisiana political machine made possible the rise of Carlos Marcello. Lansky biographer Messick described the origins and nature of the Lansky - Marcello relationship as follows: \"Lansky was smart enough, however, to recognize that even the innovation of slot"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192 Little Man’s Little Man [131] machines which paid off in mints as well as cash would not suffice forever. [Lansky's] brother Jake was listed as an officer of the Louisiana Mint Company, the n ew outfit controlling the slots, but something more was needed. \"In the Algiers section of New Orleans, across the Mississippi, he found Carlos Marcello. Born in Tunis, he had come to New Orleans in 1910 and made a living in a variety of ways, none of them successful. Nor had he bothered to become a U.S. citizen. \"Lansky gave Marcello a franchise for the Algiers section, allowing him to keep two - thirds of the slot profit. By 1940 he had 250 machines in operation and proved himself as an efficient businessma n. Later he was given a piece of the plush Beverly Club, the biggest rug joint (a posh gambling casino) in the area and at that time second to the Beverly Hills Club outside Newport, Kentucky.\" 351 MARCELLO TOOK THE HEAT Messick's concluding comments rega rding the Lansky - Marcello relationship, however, are probably the most significant: \"As a front man, Marcello worked out perfectly. In years to come he was touted as the Mafia boss of Louisiana — despite his birth in Tunis — and resisted all efforts to deport or jail him. \"With all the heat on Marcello, the role of Lansky was almost forgotten — exactly what Meyer wanted. Ultimately, Lansky was able to shift Kastel to Las Vegas and leave Marcello and Weiss to run New Orleans.\" 352 \"Meyer Lansky once explained why h e left New Orleans to Marcello and others to run. 'There was just too frigging much to do elsewhere,' he said.\" 3 53 As Messick elaborated even further, if only to drive home the point: Even Marcello's famous Beverly Club was not, in reality, Marcello's per sonal fiefdom. According to Messick, \"Costello and Kastel were partners, Marcello had a small piece, but Lansky was the real boss.\" 354 Aar o n Co hn, who was d ir ecto r o f the Ne w Or leans Cr i me Commission, lends credence to Messick's analysis of the relationsh ip. According to Cohn, \"The Commission had long been suspicious of the massiveness of Marcello's holdings — which were much too large to be controlled by a single don — even one as powerful as Marcello.\" 355 Marcello, in short, was indeed fronting for Meyer La nsky. All of this, of course, taken together, sheds a more accurate light on the truth about the Lansky connection and Carlos Marcello. LANSKY, MARCELLO & THE CIA There is also evidence that Marcello was working directly with the CIA in at least one othe r sphere of influence that also links Lansky, whose own"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Final Judgment 193 connections with American intelligence we examined in Chapter 7 and which we will examine further in Chapter 11, Chapter 12 and Chapter 14. According to Sam and Chuck Giancana, in their biography of Chicago Mafia boss, Sam Giancana, \"Marcello was a co - conspirator with the CIA in gunrunning operations and a fervent supporter of the anti - Castro exiles. It was an arrangement [Giancana] said more than once, aimed at returning Cuba to its pre - Castro glory — meaning its lucrative casinos and vice rackets.\" 356 But there was another realm in which the Lansky - CIA - Marcello nexus had a close working relationship: the illicit traffic in narcotics. The Senate Committee on Government Operations report to the 88th Co ngress on \"Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics\" had pinpointed New Orleans — at that time — as having been the key distribution point for drugs coming into the United States. Most observers believe that one of Marcello's \"legitimate\" businesses, a shrimp - boat operation, was, in fact, part of the drug - smuggling — and gun - running — network. (In Chapter 12 we shall see, in fact, that Lansky was the prime mover behind that drug network working in conjunction with the CIA.) Needless to say, Marcello's centr al positioning in New Orleans made it such that it was inevitable that the Mafia chieftain would have an inside track to gaining first - hand knowledge about developments — at least in New Orleans — in the JFK assassination conspiracy. MARCELLO, FERRIE, BANISTE R & THE CIA After all, Marcello's personal pilot was CIA contract agent David Ferrie, (now widely known as a result of his portrayal in Oliver Stone's Hollywood extravaganza, JFK). Ferrie's still - undetermined part in the JFK assassination conspiracy, and his apparent association with alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, is but another piece of the whole puzzle. It was Ferrie's associate, Guy Banister, whose New Orleans private detective agency (a conduit for CIA arms to the anti - Castro Cuban exiles) employ ed several other Marcello cronies. Banister, who had been with the Office of Naval Intelligence, and was later special - agent - in - charge of the Chicago office of the FBI, had re - located to New Orleans. 357 According to the Giancanas, Banister had long been c lose to the Chicago Mafia and that it was their good offices that brought Banister into Marcello's sphere of influence when the former FBI man went to New Orleans, initially working for the city police department. 358 (During the summer of 1963 the Cuban Re volutionary Council, a creation of the CIA's chief liaison with the anti - Castro Cuban groups, E. Howard Hunt, also maintained offices in the same building as Banister. 359 We first met Hunt, of course, in Chapter 9 where we learned of a libel trial in whic h both Hunt and the CIA were directly implicated in the JFK assassination.) Banister, clearly, was the intermediary between the CIA and the Lansky - Marcello operation in New Orleans. And it was through his office that Lee"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"194 Little Man’s Little Man [133] Harvey Oswald, was being set up a s the patsy. (In Chapter 11, Chapter 14, Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 we shall examine that aspect of the JFK assassination conspiracy further.) Without question, New Orleans and the Marcello fiefdom were an integral part of the Lansky Organized Crime Syndica te. But to suggest that Marcello was the driving force behind the JFK assassination conspiracy is to ignore the whole picture. LANSKY & THE LONG ASSASSINATION As a passing historical note, it is probably appropriate to refer to the demise of Huey Long an d the role that Lansky and his associates played in that important political event. By 1935 , Long had been elected to the Senate and had risen to national prominence. In fact, Long was generally considered a major threat to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1936 re - election chances. Long had made it clear that if he didn't run as a Democrat — or as a third party candidate — in 1936 , he certainly intended to play a major part in that election, and not on FDR's side. This, obviously, was of major concern to FDR. Thus, a Justice Department investigation of Long and his finances was unleashed. Such an inquiry was dredging up Long's tangled financial arrangements and threatened to break the back of the very profitable machine that Long had assembled. There were more than a few Louisiana political figures and Long associates who were frightened of their impending demise alongside Long at the hands of federal prosecutors. As Messick notes — and this is ironic — it was in a Dallas, Texas hotel room that the federal authorities mad e the decision to indict Long. The colorful Louisiana Senator was shot that same day by a \"lone assassin\" who was himself promptly shot to pieces by Long's bodyguards. To this day there are myriad conspiracy theories relating to Long's murder. Some say tha t the alleged assassin never fired a shot — instead, that he swung a punch at Long and that the \"murder weapon\" was planted on the scene afterward by the bodyguards who wanted to cover up the fact that it was one of them who accidentally shot Long when firin g at his assailant. There are those, however, who say that Long was, in fact, deliberately shot by one of his bodyguards. The Giancana family, in their biography of the Chicago Mafia boss, say that Sam Giancana later claimed that \"Some of our friends in Ne w York had him hit — worked it out with a New Orleans [Mafia] boss. They figured it out so it would look like a loony did it.\" 360 The real truth may never be known. Whatever the case, Long died in the hospital some hours after the shooting. What we do know i s that Long's death removed from the scene a major threat not only to the Roosevelt administration, but to the Long machine which relied so heavily on the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. With Long out of the picture, the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Final Judgment 195 federal authorities gave up th eir interest in Louisiana and its murky political underworld. The evidence now indicates that Long's death could have been prevented. Hank Messick told the story: at a meeting in Hot Springs, Arkansas at the Arlington Hotel, shortly after Long's death, Fra nk Costello filled Lansky in on the truth about Long's departure. \"We could have saved him,\" Costello told Lansky, \"but I didn't see much use in it. The doctors had their orders to let him die.\" 361 This apparently was Meyer Lansky's first major involvement in the assassination of an American political figure with whom Organized Crime had collaborated. It would not be the last time, however. That Lansky's lieutenant, Carlos Marcello had his own reasons for wanting John F. Kennedy out of the way cannot be do ubted. The Justice Department under Robert F. Kennedy had targeted Marcello repeatedly. John Davis's interesting biography of Marcello provides a detailed analysis of the Kennedy campaign against Marcello. No wonder Marcello made his famous oft - told exclam ation, \"Livarsi na petra di la scarpa\" (Take the stone from my shoe.\") Yet, such an emotional outburst does not an assassination order make. In fact, there is no evidence anywhere whatsoever that Marcello took any further affirmative action to have his ord er — if indeed one can call it an order — fulfilled. STALKING LANSKY THROUGH MARCELLO It's worth noting, in this regard, that Robert Kennedy's systematic prosecution and harassment of Marcello would have only been a logical first step in the Justice Departme nt's ultimate prosecution of Meyer Lansky. This, of course, is a standard procedure in all similar organized crime prosecutions: first the underlings are targeted — then the boss. In this case, of course, it would have been the so - called \"chairman of the boa rd,\" Meyer Lansky. Seth Kantor, Jack Ruby's acquaintance and biographer, summarizes it well: \"As Attorney General, [Robert F. Kennedy] got more indictments on members of America's criminal industry than had any previous prosecutor, pursuing them relentless ly. \"Meyer Lansky, for instance, no longer was safe behind the bolted doors of that industry's executive suite. The Attorney General put together what was known inside the Justice Department as the OCD (Organized Crime Division) and was stalking Lansky's s ecret operations in the Bahamas and Las Vegas.\" 362 The assassination of John F. Kennedy and the demise of Robert Kennedy's campaign against organized crime as a direct consequence prevented this from happening. The end of the Kennedy war on organized crime was a major consequence — a major victory — for the organized crime fiefdom of Meyer Lansky."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"196 Little Man’s Little Man [135] Of course, as we have said, even if the JFK murder was strictly a \"Mafia\" operation — with no tentacles leading elsewhere — it would have been Lansky who ordered it fro m the start. Meyer Lansky was Carlos Marcello's immediate superior in the world of organized crime and not vice versa. There is simply no way of getting around Lansky's critical positioning in the center of the vast conspiracy. What we are demonstrating he re is that the conspiracy reached above and beyond \"the Mafia.\" And that is central to our thesis. LANSKY'S 'KOSHER NOSTRA' Interestingly, Ruby biographer Seth Kantor differentiated between what he called \"Lansky's 'Kosher Nostra\" and what the separately referred to as \"the hot - blooded Sicilian Cosa Nostra.\" 363 Certainly, Carlos Marcello breathed a sigh of satisfaction when John F. Kennedy died in Dallas. However, Meyer Lansky was, of course, the ultimate beneficiary. Any major operation such as the ass assination of a president — even if proposed by Marcello single - handedly — would have first had to have been cleared by Marcello through his boss, Meyer Lansky. Thus, it would have been Lansky himself who most certainly had to have given the go - ahead, even if the Kennedy assassination plot originated with Marcello alone. The evidence, of course, suggests, however, that Marcello and his associates in New Orleans were simply pawns in a more far - reaching conspiracy that originated elsewhere. Their proximity to Osw ald and the New Orleans end of the conspiracy, however, makes them an easy target for those who seek to find a \"Mafia\" conspiracy behind the murder. WEASEL WORDS As noted previously, those very sources who point to Marcello as the mastermind of the JFK m urder choose to ignore Marcello's secondary positioning to Meyer Lansky in the syndicate chain of command. Lansky - linked Robert Blakey's House Assassinations Committee gingerly skirted around the issue, however. In its final report the committee concluded : \"Given the far - reaching possible consequences of an assassination plot by the commission [i.e. the national `commission’ of Organized Crime], the committee found that such a conspiracy would have been the subject of serious discussion by members of the c ommission, and that no matter how guarded such discussions might have been, some trace of them would have emerged from the surveillance coverage [by federal authorities]. \"It was possible to conclude, therefore, that it is unlikely that the national crime syndicate as a group, acting under the leadership of the commission, participated in the assassination of President Kennedy. \"While the committee found it unlikely that the national crime syndicate was involved in the assassination, it recognized that a pa rticular organized crime leader or a small combination of leaders, acting unilaterally,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"[136] Final Judgment 197 might have formulated an assassination conspiracy without the consent of the commission.\" 364 These are weasel words, to be sure. However, one could also conclude fro m the committee's presumption that if indeed Organized Crime did play some significant role in the assassination conspiracy, that it was not a conspiracy that originated with \"the Mafia,\" for example. Perhaps then the conspiracy originated elsewhere. That, of course, is the conclusion presented in Final Judgment. Unwittingly, then, the House Committee has provided us even further basis for the conclusions drawn here. LANSKY NOT MENTIONED The House Committee report had nothing to say about the Lansky - Marce llo connection. This is par for the course in standard accounts of the JFK assassination which promote the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" What is also particularly interesting is that Robert Lacey's Lansky biography, Little Man, never once mentions La nsky's sponsorship of Marcello, nor does Marcello's name appear once in the book. The New Orleans connection is barely mentioned at all, and only in passing. Was Marcello — who even the FBI has said headed \"the first family\" of the Mafia — that unimportant? Co uld it be that because Marcello's name has been repeatedly linked to the JFK assassination that for Lacey — a very friendly biographer who worked closely with Lansky's family — to bring up Marcello's much - abused name would obviously draw in the Lansky connecti on to the JFK assassination? Is it possible that Marcello and his associates such as David Ferrie were deliberately drawn into the periphery of the assassination plot in order to deliberately plant the possibility that the blame for the assassination could be laid upon Marcello and the Mafia — in the event, perhaps, that the image of Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator\" failed to work? This is indeed a possibility and would fit firmly into the long - standing Israeli Mossad policy of using \"false flags\" in its criminal endeavors. Clearly, there's a lot more to the relationship between Meyer Lansky and key \"suspects\" in the JFK assassination than meets the eye. All of which, again, points toward Lansky's central role in the international conspiracy which we document."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven Cuban Love Song: M eyer Lansky, t he M afia, t he CIA and t he M o ssa d a nd t he Ca stro Assa ssina t io n P lo t s T h r e e t o p \" M a f i a \" f i g u r e s — S a m G i a n c a n a a n d J o h n n y R o s s e l l i o f C h i c a g o a n d S a n t o T r a f f i c a n t e , J r . o f Tampa — were key figures i n the CIA - Mob plots against Fidel Castro and often linked to the JFK assassination.

Carlos Ma rcello is not the only major \"Mafia\" figure whose connections with Organized Crime syndicate boss Meyer Lansky have been ignored by Lansky's friendly biographer Robert Lacey. The legendary Johnny Rosselli is never mentioned either. Was neither Marcello nor Rosselli worth mentioning? Were they really that insignificant? Not according to standard accounts of Organized Crime history. Both Marcello and Rosselli have particular prominence in the annals of criminal folklore, especially in relation to the Kennedy assassination. It is quite significant that Lacey has chosen to delete Rosselli from his account of Lansky's life:   Rosselli was a major figure in Organized Crime in Los Angeles, where Lansky's longtime associate Ben Siegel — and Siegel's successor as Lansky' s West Coast operative, Mickey Cohen — represented Lansky's interests.   Rosselli was a major figure in Organized Crime in Las Vegas, where Lansky maintained major gambling operations. He was Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana's primary representative there;   Ross elli was a major figure in Organized Crime in Havana, representing the interests of the Chicago Mafia, where Lansky also dominated gambling operations. By all standard accounts, Rosselli was very much a key figure in the modern \"Mafia\" as we know it. In sh ort, while Marcello's activities were based almost entirely in his Gulf Coast fiefdom (and extending into Texas), Rosselli operated as almost a roving ambassador for the Italian wing of Organized Crime (popularly called \"the Mafia.\"), primarily the Chicago branch."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"[138] Final Judgment 199 Yet, Rosselli's ties to Lansky have been ignored by Lansky's biographer Robert Lacey. Why? Lacey's biography (which is otherwise quite detailed) would suggest — by virtue of ignoring both Marcello and Rosselli — that Lansky had no connections with t hem at all, or that any connections he did have were so insignificant that they weren't even worth mentioning. Rosselli's name — like that of Marcello — has also been prominently linked to the Kennedy murder. One can only wonder why Lansky's biographer failed to bring in these clearly important connections. Even Tiger (described in the index as \"(Lansky's dog)\" is mentioned — not once, but twice. (Carlos Marcello is not mentioned at all.) Rosselli was also particularly close to Lansky's Florida and Havana lieuten ant, Santo Trafficante, Jr, who is also practically a \"non - person\" in Lacey's account of Lansky's ventures. And, as we shall see, it may well have been Trafficante who arranged Rosselli's own ultimate assassination on behalf of the CIA. Like Rosselli, Traf ficante was also a major figure in the annals of crime and much more so than even Rosselli, was an intimate working partner of Lansky. In fact, as we shall see in much more detail in Chapter 12, Trafficante — although a \"Mafia\" leader — was Lansky's immediate underling in the gambling and narcotics rackets. In Lacey's biography of Lansky, Trafficante is also given short shrift. In fact, he is hardly mentioned at all, except in minor passing — just eight times. In fact there are fewer references to Trafficante tha n there are to yet another Lansky dog, Bruzzer, who rates 13 references, including a detailed review of the dog's sad final days. In Kennedy assassination folklore this is also particularly relevant, inasmuch as we have been told repeatedly that Trafficant e once told one Jose Aleman, Jr., a wealthy Cuban exile, that JFK was scheduled to be hit. However, interestingly enough, the rest of the story goes untold. According to J. Edgar Hoover biographer Curt Gentry, it was, in fact, Aleman's i mpression that alth ough Trafficante may have been aware of assassination plot against Kennedy that Trafficante himself \"wasn't principal architect.\" 365 Who, then, was? THE LANSKY - CIA ALLIANCE All of this is interesting about Rosselli and Trafficante, particularly in the context of their central involvement in CIA - Organized Crime assassination plots aimed at Fidel Castro who had seized control of Lansky's gambling operations in Havana. There is much, much more to the Rosselli - Trafficante link with Meyer Lansky that needs to be explored, for this connection opens up another area: Lansky's long - standing and intimate ties with Israel's allies in the CIA. Indeed, as we shall see in Chapter 12, Lansky's CIA linkage goes far beyond Cuba and the Caribbean. It even extended into S outheast Asia."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"200 Cuban Love Son g [139] As we saw in Chapter 7 (and which has been repeatedly documented by perhaps hundreds of writers over and over again), organized crime — Meyer Lansky in particular — had much to lose when communist revolutionary Fidel Castro came to power in Cu ba. Prior to the advent of Castro, Cuba had been a primary gambling money - making base of operations for the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and its Mafia lieutenants. Anthony Summers summarizes the situation well: \"Castro's predecessor, the dictator Batista, had long been a puppet on strings pulled by American intelligence and the mob. In 1944, when the United States feared trouble from the Cuban left, Lansky reportedly persuaded Batista to step down for a while. When he came back in 1952, it was aft er the current President, Carlos Prio Socarras, was persuaded to resign, a departure reportedly eased by a bribe of a quarter of a million dollars and a major stake in the casino business. \"It was now that the gambling operation already established in Cuba became a Mafia bonanza . . .When the Batista regime began to crumble before a revolution of popular outrage, the mob hedged its political bets by courting Fidel Castro. \"Many of the guns which helped him to power in 1959 had been provided courtesy of Mafi a gunrunners, a policy which did not pay off. Lansky saw the writing on the wall and flew out of Havana the day Castro marched in.\" 366 Investigative reporter Jim Hougan described the relationship between the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and the C ubans — both Castro and his enemies. \"The Mob's relationship to the arrivista Castro regime was a stormy one. On the one hand, some of its members had been active in the revolution, ferrying guns to Castro's guerrillas. On the other hand, the new Cuban premi er seemed determined to eradicate those social evils that the Mob found most profitable: drugs, prostitution, and gambling. Castro had, moreover, jailed both Trafficante and Meyer Lansky's brother Jake in the wake of his triumphal march upon Havana.\" 367 Ho wever, the initial mob support for Castro went sour when Castro proved to be a danger to the Lansky syndicate's lucrative operations in Cuba. It was at this point, then, that the mob did a turn - around and began working against Castro. Although many syndica te figures still hoped that they could resume operations in Cuba after Castro was removed from office, Lansky was more realistic and practical. He began looking to the Bahamas as his next Caribbean gambling base of operations. Still, Lansky maintained his ties with the anti - Castro Cubans. It was during this period the CIA was preparing to move against Castro. Lansky would play a major role in that effort. For an even more obscure reason — one which has often gone un noticed — perhaps unmentioned — Lansky had anot her reason to be disenchanted with Fidel Castro and supportive of anti - Castro Cuban"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"[140] Final Judgment 201 elements. The fact is that many of the anti - Castro Cubans who had settled in Miami and elsewhere following Castro's rise to power were Cuban Jews. THE CUBAN 'JEWISH CONN ECTION' American CIA - financed anti - Castro propagandist Paul D. Bethel, writing in the December 15, 1965 issue of the Latin America Report (subtitled the \"Free Cuba News\") gives us some interesting facts about the status of Jews in Cuba before and after th e advent of Castro. Bethel noted that of a total of 11,000 Jews in Cuba at the time of Castro's takeover, only 1,900 remained at that time. The rest had already joined the anti - Castro Cuban colonies which had largely migrated to the Miami and New Orleans a reas. Of those remaining, an additional 1,300 were leaving at the time of Bethel's report . 368 The affluent Cuban Jewish community was, in fact, an important faction within the overall anti - Castro Cuban community. This, coupled with Lansky's financial loss in Cuba, made him all the more inclined to strike against Castro in cooperation with the CIA. LANSKY AND THE ASSASSINATION PLOTS Although Anthony Summers' previously - cited book on the JFK conspiracy, aptly titled Conspiracy, devotes very little attentio n to Meyer Lansky's pivotal role in Organized Crime, he does make reference to a CIA anti - Castro operation funded by Lansky. CIA operative E. Howard Hunt put together the Revolutionary Democratic Front, a coalition of anti - Castro Cubans, headed by Manuel A ntonio de Varona, a former president of the Cuban Senate. In fact, as Summers tells us, de Varona met with Lansky for financial support and also received funds through the Washington, D.C. firm of Edward K. Moss and Associates, which represented the intere sts of Lansky operatives Dino and Eddie Cellini. 369 (In Chapter 9 we first met the aforementioned CIA operative, E. Howard Hunt, and learned how he was implicated, in a little - publicized libel trial, in the JFK conspiracy. In Chapter 16 we shall learn much more about the circumstances which led up to that trial.) Now although the famous CIA - Mafia assassination plots against Castro have been reported time and again, the key organized crime players in the tale are always the aforementioned Santo Trafficante, Jr., Johnny Rosselli and Sam Giancana of Chicago. Rosselli's biographers note that it was CIA contract agent Robert Maheu, a longtime acquaintance of Rosselli, who initiated the CIA's dealings with organized crime in the anti - Castro plots. 370 (It was this same Maheu, a former FBI agent as well, who had worked directly under the former special - agent - in - charge of the Chicago FBI office, Guy Banister. 371 It was Banister, as we saw in Chapter 10, who was the direct link between the Lansky - Marcello - CIA gun - run ning on behalf of the anti - Castro Cuban network.)"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"202 Cuban Love Song [141] Maheu, who had become friendly with Rosselli during business trips to Las Vegas, had been approached by the CIA to open up negotiations with the Mafia for this special, mutually beneficial, operation. Thu s, the initial plot was set in place. However, there were subsequent developments: \"Once the basic groundwork was laid, Rosselli decided to introduce two new players into the picture. One was Rosselli's Chicago boss, Sam Giancana, and the other was Santo T rafficante, Meyer Lansky's colleague in the Havana casinos. Trafficante's connections could prove helpful in moving the plots along, and besides, Mafia tradition required that as the local don, he be informed of any activity taking place in his domain.\" 372 There is no question that Trafficante, Rosselli and Giancana did indeed help coordinate assassination plots against Castro with representatives of the CIA. (This, as we have said, has been thoroughly documented time and again. To discuss this here would b elabor the point.) However, as one author succinctly put it: \"Lansky was the top man in the CIA - Mafia plot against Castro, but the only journalist who had guts enough to point this out was [columnist] Victor Riesel.\" 373 JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott acknowledges that Lansky was indeed involved in the CIA plots against Castro, 374 but, Lansky's role has been obscured, ignored, or otherwise gone unmentioned. In fact, as we shall see in Chapter 12 when we examine the Lansky - Trafficante relation ship further, Trafficante was Lansky's subordinate. All of Trafficante's anti - Castro operations in league with the CIA were being conducted with Lansky's approval and under Lansky's watchful eye. The latter phase of the CIA's anti - Castro operations were kn own as Operation MongooseHeadquarters of the operation — known as JM/Wave — were in Lansky's own city of Miami and based on the campus of the University of Miami. Part of the CIA's campaign against Castro included its so - called ZR/Rifle Team project. Skilled a ssassins, recruited from around the globe (and often from the ranks of professional mercenaries and from within organized crime) were on retainer for use in the CIA's own private \"hit team\" or terrorist army, as the case may be. One of the prime in - house s upervisors of the ZR/Rifle Team project was the CIA's counterintelligence chief, Israel's loyal ally, James J. Angleton. ROSSELLI & THE JFK ASSASSINATION That Rosselli, for example, was entwined in some aspect of the JFK assassination conspiracy seems ce rtain. Evidence suggests that Rosselli was definitely engaged in activities during the summer and fall of 1963 that tied him directly to several of the key figures in the assassination conspiracy. Rosselli's biographers themselves have suggested that Rosse lli was indeed involved in the assassination itself. According to Rappleye and Becker: \"The strongest indication that John Rosselli had a hand in the pre - assassination planning is a report of a direct contact between Rosselli and Jack Ruby in early October 1963. There were two meetings, both taking place in small motels near Miami, and both observed by the FBI. One of the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"[142] Final Judgment 203 federal investigators probing Rosselli's murder thirteen years later came across an FBI report on the meetings and relayed its contents , on a confidential basis, to Washington, D.C. reporter William Scott Malone. \"An accomplished investigator himself, Malone said in an interview he was confident of the integrity of his source, and said the FBI had determined the actual site of the Miami m eetings.\" 375 According to Rappleye and Becker, Rosselli visited Guy Banister's office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. It was in the same controversial building that the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) had an office. The CRC, as we saw in Chapter 9, w as the brainchild of the CIA's chief liaison with the anti - Castro Cuban exiles, E. Howard Hunt, himself implicated in the JFK assassination.) Rosselli's biographers even go further, asking \"Was Rosselli, in fact, in Dallas? FBI surveillance loses his trail on the West Coast between November 19 and November 27.\" 376 According to the Giancanas, the president was deliberately lured to Dallas where the operation could be carried off to the specifications of the plan. \"The politicians and the CIA made it real sim ple,\" Sam Giancana explained. \"We'd each provide men for the hit. I'd oversee the Outfit [Mafia] side of things and throw in Jack Ruby and some extra backup and the CIA would put their own guys on to take care of the rest.\" 377 So it was that Johnny Rossel li and Sam Giancana — along with Santo Trafficante, Jr. — were brought into the JFK assassination conspiracy. The full story of Sam Giancana's role in much of these matters — the JFK assassination in particular — never became known until his own nephew and brother went public in 1992 with their book Double Cross. However, we now know that there was indeed a major Mossad influence at work in the affairs of Sam Giancana. SAM GIANCANA'S MOSSAD CONNECTION . . . An eye - opening new book, Double Deal, bares new facts ab out the secret history of the famed Chicago \"Mafia,\" revealing certain significant never - before - told details that further confirm the likelihood of Mossad involvement in the JFK assassination. The author of the new book, Michael Corbitt — the mobbed - up forme r chief of police of a Chicago suburb — has joined writer Sam Giancana — nephew of the legendary Chicago Mafia figure — in producing a startling expose that unveils, for the first time ever, the surprising identity of the little - known \"mystery man\" who was the r eal \"power behind the throne\" in organized crime in Chicago and whose influenced reach all the way to Israel, Panama, Iran, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. Despite his famous \"Mafia\" name, Corbitt's co - author, Giancana, was never involved in the family busi ness and earlier wrote the account of the life and crimes of his late uncle, who had been murdered in 1975. Now Giancana is telling \"the rest of the story.\""},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 Cuban Love Song [143] Giancana and Corbitt dare to report something that has never been published anywhere before: that a shadowy Jewish, Mossad - connected gangster named Hyman \"Hal\" Lamer was the real, continuing behind - the - scenes force guiding the Chicago mob for over thirty years. Despite the media - ballyhooed \"revolving door\" of Italian - American Mafia bosses such as Gian cana and others who were alternately jailed or \"whacked,\" it was Lamer who was continually in charge. Beyond that, the authors reveal that much of Lamer's criminal activity was conducted not only in concert with the CIA, but also, in particular, with the M ossad. Lamer was not just a major figure in Chicago crime, but on the international scene as well. He was also a longtime associate of Jewish crime chief Meyer Lansky but, effectively, Lansky's successor when Lansky died in 1983. According to Corbitt, he l earned early on, during his mob days, of Larner's existence, although Larner's presence so high up in the mob was something neither government investigators nor a media (which was otherwise fascinated by the mob) wanted to focus on. Corbitt writes: \"All th e other Outfit guys were in the papers every day, their pictures plastered all over the front page of the Tribune. But when Hy Larner's name was mentioned in the papers, he was described only as an 'associate' or `protégé' or some gangster and nothing more than that. Nobody knew how deep his contacts went or how high up. Reporters called him a 'riddle\" and a `mystery man.' 378 As Corbitt himself advanced in organized crime circles under the patronage of Lamer's man, Giancana, Corbitt ultimately began to lea rn the secret of how and why the Chicago mob was able to operate so freely. It was the partnership with the Mossad — running guns to Israel – that gave the Chicago mob its 'get out of jail free' card as far as Israeli sympathizers high up in the Justice Depart ment were concerned. Corbitt writes: \"At the insistence of Meyer Lansky, [Giancana] and his pals started working with the Israeli Mossad, smuggling weapons in the Middle East. Everything was coming in and out of Panama, which meant that everything was bein g handled by Hy Lamer. Lamer was without a doubt Sam Giancana's most trusted financial advisor. He had everybody who was anybody in Panama — from bankers to generals — eating out of his hand. Once they started running guns to Israel, Lamer also had the U.S. mi litary and its airstrips at his disposal.\"' 379 And contrary to popular legend, they say — confirming what Final Judgment had already reported in earlier editions — it was not Giancana nor another famed Chicago mobster, Johnny Roselli, who cemented the now - inf amous CIA - Mafia plots to kill Castro, it was Meyer Lansky and Lamer. In addition, Corbitt and Giancana reveal, Lamer was also deeply enmeshed with two of Lansky's chief high - level lieutenants, Carlos Marcello in New Orleans and Santo Trafficante in Tampa. The two southern Mafia leaders were engaged with Lamer in lucrative guns and drugs smuggling operations in the Caribbean, not to mention gambling as well."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"[144] Final Judgment 205 Larner and Lansky were particularly close. Corbitt and Giancana say that the two master criminals w ere \"Zionists — passionate defenders of the divine right of Jews to occupy the Holy Land of Jerusalem. . . But Hy Lamer and Meyer Lansky weren't just Zionists, they were also mobsters who believed the end justifies the means. Put organized crime and the U.S. government at their disposal and you've got a very powerful force . . . 380 Lamer and Giancana were also engaged in gambling deals with casinos based in Iran, then the fiefdom of the Shah of Iran whose infamous secret police, SAVAK, was a joint creation o f the CIA and the Mossad — a major point of contention when Islamic fundamentalists overthrew the Shah and forced him into exile. Corbitt also reveals the amazing story of how Giancana (with Larner's help) finally got the U.S. Justice Department off his back . It turns out that as much as President Lyndon Johnson and his Zionist advisors wanted to wage war against Egypt and the other Arab states on behalf of Israel, U.S. entanglement in Vietnam made it impossible for Johnson to act. However, Giancana not only put up a substantial amount of money to help arm Israel for its 1967 war against the Arab countries, but, in addition, Lamer and Giancana arranged shipments of stolen weapons to Israel from one of their outposts in Panama, an operation conducted in league with the Mossad's Panamanian - based operative, Michael Harari. In return for this service on behalf of Israel, President Johnson ordered the Justice Department to drop its campaign against Giancana. In the end, though, the arrangement between Giancana and L amer came to an end. Lamer, it appears, was almost certainly behind Giancana's 1975 murder. Lamer, however, continued to thrive, even as a series of Giancana's successors were faced with a continuing series of federal prosecutions, widely hailed by the med ia as \"the end of the mob in Chicago.\" GIANCANA AND ROSSELLI EXECUTED Giancana was murdered execution style in his own home in Chicago on June 19, 1975. The Establishment media hyped it as yet another \"Mafia killing.\" The Giancana family doesn't think th at's what it was. They say it was a CIA double cross. (And clearly, too, the Mossad was involved.) As it just so happens, Giancana was killed the very day that congressional investigators were on their way to Chicago to interview the Mafia leader about rep orted CIA - organized crime plots against Castro. Sam and Chuck Giancana frankly assert in their own book that it may have been Johnny Rosselli who helped arrange Giancana's murder. According to the Giancanas they believe that the CIA contracted out the Gian cana murder and that the CIA had arranged it through Trafficante. The Giancanas believe that Trafficante, in turn, saw to it that Rosselli arranged the Chicago hit on Sam Giancana. As they summarize matters: \"[Giancana's] Outfit friends knew he never would have divulged damaging information; the CIA, rampant with spies and counterspies, crosses and double crosses, may not have been so certain of his loyalty. \"381"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 Cuban Love Song [145] In any case, Johnny Rosselli never lived long enough to tell the true story of the CIA - Meyer L ansky Crime Syndicate operations in the Caribbean — and in Dallas. On July 28, 1976, Rosselli disappeared in Miami. On August 7, the flamboyant mobster's butchered corpse bobbed up in a drum from the bottom of the ocean. Charles Rappleye and Ed Becker note t hat there have been suspicions that it was indeed Trafficante, again, who may have even arranged the hit on Rosselli. However, they point out that there are many in the Mafia who do not believe this necessarily to be the case. In the judgment of Rosselli's biographers, \"The CIA certainly had the contacts in Cuban Miami to pull off Rosselli's execution, and as it had demonstrated by enlisting him in the first place, it had the will. Even the evidence pointing to Trafficante did not rule out collaboration by the spy agency. ” 382 As the authors point out, Trafficante did indeed have very close connections with the CIA — connections that went above and beyond his dealings with the spy agency in anti - Castro operations. In Chapter 12 we shall see, indeed, that Traf ficante, as Lansky's primary lieutenant in the Southeast Asian drug smuggling racket, developed even closer and more intimate ties to the CIA following the JFK assassination. Only Santo Trafficante, Jr., Meyer Lansky's subordinate, remained alive and, as t he Giancana family notes, \"conducted business without so much as a whisper of legal difficulty.\" 383 The Giancanas point out: \"One had only to read the newspapers to see that the focus of underworld crime busters was not on Tampa, Florida, but on its highl y visible New York and Chicago cousins to the north.\" 384 And by this time — the mid - 1970's — Lansky himself was ailing and almost infirm. Trafficante himself died of kidney failure in 1987 — just four years after Lansky. THE MAFIA AND THE MOSSAD The bottom li ne: anyone who attempts to view the JFK assassination as a \"Mafia hit\" is making a big mistake, failing to calculate in the role of Mossad - connected Meyer Lansky, his Chicago associate Hyman Lamer, and their allies in Israel's Mossad, not to mention the CI A itself. So, once again, the Mossad connection is very much there, although there are few \"JFK assassination experts\" who are willing to admit it.

Students of the global drug trade are indebted to Professor Alfred McCoy of the prestigious University of Wisconsin at Madison for his ground - breaking expose of the real origins of the modern - day drug crisis. First published in 1972 — despite the strongest efforts of the CIA to block its publication — McCoy's classic work, Th e Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, has withstood the test of time. In 1992 McCoy re - issued the work under the title The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade. The new edition is an equally remarkable work which not only includes additional findings uncovered in the subsequent 20 years since its initial publication, but also a valuable preface in which McCoy outlines the CIA operations against his research and the publication of the book. THE DRUG BOSS"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"208 A n Opiate for the Masses [147] Although the Establishment media has repeatedly pinpointed Santo Trafficante, Jr., Mafia boss of Tampa, as the brains behind the Southeast Asian drug traffic, McCoy makes it very clear that Trafficante was simply operating as Lansky's underling. McCoy describes the origins of the La nsky - Trafficante relationship: \"During the 1930's Meyer Lansky 'discovered' the Caribbean for northeastern syndicate bosses and invested their illegal profits in an assortment of lucrative gambling ventures. In 1933 Lansky moved into the Miami Beach area a nd took over most of the illegal off - track betting and a variety of hotels and casinos. He was also reportedly responsible for organized crime's decision to declare Miami a 'free city' (that is, not subject to the usual rules of territorial monopoly). \"Fol lowing his success in Miami, Lansky moved to Havana for three years, and by the beginning of World War II he owned the Hotel Nacional's casino and was leasing the municipal racetrack from a reputable New York bank. \"Burdened by the enormous scope of his ho ldings, Lansky had to delegate much of his responsibility for daily management to local gangsters. One of Lansky's earliest associates in Florida was Santo Trafficante, Sr., a Sicilian - born Tampa gangster. Trafficante had earned his reputation as an effect ive organizer in the Tampa gambling rackets and was already a figure of some stature when Lansky first arrived in Florida. By the time Lansky returned to New York in 1940, Trafficante had assumed responsibility for Lansky's interests in Havana and Miami. TRAFFICANTE THE FRONT MAN \"By the early 1950s Trafficante had himself become such an important figure that he delegated his Havana concessions to Santo Trafficante, Jr., the most talented of his six sons. The younger Santo's official position in Havana wa s that of manager of the Sans Souci Casino, but he was far more important than his title indicates. \"As his father's financial representative, and ultimately Meyer Lansky's, Santo Jr. controlled much of Havana's tourist industry and became quite close to t he pre - Castro dictator, Fulgencio Batista. Moreover, it was reportedly his responsibility to receive bulk shipments of heroin from Europe and forward them through Florida to New York and other major urban centers, where the distribution was assisted by the local Mafia bosses.\" 386 LANSKY MOVES TO THE TOP Lansky biographer Hank Messick makes it very clear that it was Trafficante Jr. who played a key role in ensuring Lansky's dominance over syndicate gambling in Cuba. It was Trafficante who helped orchestra te the assassination in 1957 of Lansky rival, New York Mafia figure Albert Anastasia, the most vocal Italian Mafia critic of Lansky's growing influence"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"[148] Final Judgment 209 in the Cuban gambling rackets. Anastasia's removal from the scene was vital to Lansky's ultimate domin ance. Messick notes that Trafficante got caught in the middle between Albert Anastasia and Lansky over the Havana gambling. Not only did Trafficante opt to abandon his fellow Italian Mafia figure, but Trafficante also swore a blood oath Mafia - style, assuri ng Lansky of his support. \"So long as the blood flows in my body,\" he intoned solemnly, \"do I, Santo Trafficante, swear allegiance to the will of Meyer Lansky and the organization he represents. If I violate this oath, may I burn in hell forever.\" 387 He si gned it in his own blood. It was shortly thereafter, on October 25, 1957, that Anastasia was shot dead after what he wrongly believed to have been a friendly meeting in New York with Trafficante. Anastasia should have known what was coming. After all, acco rding to Messick, he had, shortly before, told his fellow Mafia figures what he thought of them: \"You bastards have sold yourselves to the Jews.\" 388 (Interestingly enough, Lansky's friendly biographical cheerleader, Robert Lacey, never mentions the Lansky - Anastasia stand - off that led to the Lansky rival's murder.) Organized crime authority Dan Moldea summarized the Lansky - Trafficante relationship best and most succinctly: \"Trafficante was deeply devoted to Lansky.\" 3 89 THE MAFIA UNDER FIRE It was shortly after Albert Anastasia's murder that public attention began focusing on Organized Crime as a result of media publicity. It was not, in fact, until the infamous Mafia conclave at Appalachian, New York, in 1957 that the media began hyping \"the Mafia\" as a m ajor force in organized crime. Americans had long been aware of legendary mobsters such as Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, but general awareness that a national crime syndicate did indeed exist was not commonplace. Following a police raid of the Appalachian c onference — attended exclusively by top Mafia figures from around the country, Trafficante included — public attention began focusing on \"the Mafia\" — thanks to the media. The official story has always been that a local policeman just happened to stumble upon th e conclave at the home of Mafia figure Joseph Barbara. The officer called in reinforcements and a major \"bust\" took place, following a heated chase of the Mafia figures through the briars and brambles of the rural countryside. However, according to Hank Me ssick, the police had been tipped off by a Lansky associate that the meeting was about to take place. Messick described the consequences of the Appalachian raid: \"The delegates were scattered before any alliance could be reached. And the publicity caused t he greatest heat since the 1930's. It focused not only"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210 An Opiate for the Masses [149] on the men who attended the session but on the entire Mafia. What's more, it continued for well over a year as state and federal officials tried to find some charge to stick against the delegates the y had captured or identified. Not only were Mafia leaders immobilized by the continuing publicity, but also they were demoralized. Almost instinctively they rallied to Lansky and other non - Mafia syndicate leaders for advice and assistance.\" 390 (Perhaps not coincidentally, one of the attorneys who played a key role in the Appalachian investigation was one Justin Finger. It was Finger who later went on to become chief of the \"civil rights division\" of the Lansky - financed Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith , the primary intelligence and propaganda arm of Israel's Mossad in the United States.) Despite all this, as Messick notes, Trafficante himself stood to benefit. According to Messick: \"Trafficante was a little annoyed at the publicity he received — after bei ng picked up with the rest — but was soon mollified when he discovered he was now being hailed as the Mafia boss of Florida by the press. Glory was as important as loot to the Mafia mind.\" 391 Clearly, a close working relationship between Lansky and Traffican te had been cemented. It continued for many years, up to and including — and beyond — the critical year of 1963. It was in 1970, however, that Lansky, preparing to take refuge in Israel, turned over most of his responsibilities to his subordinate, Santo Traffi cante, Jr. By this time Lansky was aging and in ill health. He was ready to move into retirement. In 1968 — just two years earlier — Trafficante had journeyed to Saigon, Hong Kong and Singapore. It was there in the exotic East that he was solidifying the longt ime relationship between Lansky and the CIA in the international drug racket. WHO'S THE BOSS? Here we turn once again to Professor Alfred McCoy for an elucidation of Lansky's ties with the CIA in the Southeast Asian drug racket and the covert part it pla yed in the CIA's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. McCoy writes: \"[After Mafia kingpin Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, was deported from the United States in 1946], he charged his longtime associate Meyer Lansky with the responsibility of managing his financia l empire. Lansky also played a key role in organizing Luciano's heroin syndicate: he supervised smuggling operations, negotiated with Corsican heroin manufacturers, and managed the collection and concealment of the enormous profits \"Lansky's control over t he Caribbean and his relationship with the Florida - based Trafficante family were of particular importance, since many of the heroin shipments passed through Cuba or Florida on their way to America's urban markets. For almost twenty years the Luciano - Lansky - Trafficante partnership remained a major feature of the international heroin traffic.\" 39 2 McCoy notes further: \"There is reason to believe that Meyer Lansky's 1949 - 1950 European tour was instrumental in promoting Marseille's heroin"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"[150] Final Judgment 211 industry. After cro ssing the Atlantic in a luxury liner, Lansky visited [Lucky] Luciano in Rome, where they discussed the narcotics trade. He then traveled to Zurich and contacted prominent Swiss bankers through John Pullman, an old friend from the rum running days. \"These n egotiations established the financial labyrinth that organized crime used for decades to smuggle its enormous gambling and heroin profits out of the country into numbered Swiss bank accounts without attracting the notice of the U.S. Internal Revenue Servic e. \"Pullman was responsible for the European end of Lansky's financial operation: depositing, transferring, and investing the money when it arrived in Switzerland.\" 393 THE MOSSAD DRUG LINK As we noted in Chapter 7, Lansky biographer Hank Messick himself pointed out that, ultimately, Pullman's chief Swiss depository for Lansky's drug money was the Banque de Credit International (BCI), established in 1959. This bank, as we have seen, was the brainchild of longtime Israeli Mossad officer Tibor Rosenbaum. In Chapter 15 we shall examine the Lansky - Rosenbaum - BCI link to the JFK assassination in detail. According to Messick, \"Once safely deposited in numbered accounts at BCI and other banks], it could be invested in the stock market or returned in the form of loa ns to individuals and corporations controlled by the National Crime Syndicate.\" 394 (Pullman, who had moved from Lansky's base in Miami beach to Montreal was Lansky's lieutenant in charge of that phase of the international drug operations.) THE CORSICAN M AFIA McCoy describes Lansky's European sojourn further: \"After making the financial arrangements with Pullman in Switzerland, Lansky traveled through France, where he met with high - ranking Corsican syndicate leaders on the Riviera and in Paris. After leng thy discussions, Lansky and the Corsicans are reported to have arrived at some sort of agreement concerning the international heroin traffic. \"Soon after Lansky returned to the United States, heroin laboratories began appearing in Marseille. In future year s, U.S. narcotics experts were to estimate that the majority of America's heroin supply was being manufactured in Marseille.” 395 McCoy notes that the European phase of the Lansky drug operations gradually began moving out of the hands of Lansky's assoc iates in the Sicilian Mafia to the Marseille area in France, under the domination of the Corsican Mafia. 396 All of this took place at the same time Israel's friend in the American OSS (and later the CIA), James Angleton was engaged in the region, assistin g the emigration of European Jews to Palestine. (In Chapter 8 we"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"212 An Opiate for the Masses [151] examined Angleton's role in these affairs further, including his links to the Corsican Mafia and to BCI founder Tibor Rosenbaum.) LANSK Y, TH E CIA AND TH E CO RSICAN M AFIA McCoy explains how the CIA had developed ties with Lansky's partners in the Corsican Mafia: \"The CIA . . . had sent agents and a psychological warfare team to Marseille, where they dealt directly with Corsican syndicate leaders through the Guerini brothers [Antoine and Bart helemy, leaders of the Corsican Mafia].\" 397 The CIA's operatives supplied arms and money to Corsican gangs for assaults on Communist picket lines and harassment of important union officials. The communists had amassed much political clout in the region an d the CIA utilized the Corsican Mafia to shatter the communists' strength. \"The Guerinis gained enough power and status from their role in smashing the 1947 strike to emerge as the new leaders of the Corsican underworld. While the CIA was instrumental in r estoring the Corsican underworld's political influence, it was not until the 1950 dock strike that the Guerinis gained enough power to take control of the Marseille waterfront. \"The combination of political influence and control of the docks created the id eal environment for the growth of Marseille's heroin laboratories — fortuitously at the same time that Mafia boss Lucky Luciano was seeking an alternative source of heroin supply.\" 398 THE VIETNAMESE DRUG LINK As McCoy notes further, the CIA had also began flexing its muscles in Southeast Asia, where the drug trade originated. McCoy describes the CIA's relationship with the indigenous drug racketeers: \"[In Laos] from 1960 to 1975, the CIA created a secret army of 30,000 Hmong tribesmen to battle Laotian Com munists near the border with North Vietnam. Since the Hmong's main cash crop was opium, the CIA adopted a complicitous posture toward the traffic, allowing the Hmong commander, General Vang Po, to use the CIA's Air America to collect opium from his scatter ed highland villages. \"In late 1969, the CIA's various covert action clients opened a network of heroin laboratories in the Golden Triangle. In their first years of operation, these laboratories exported high - grade no. 4 heroin to U.S. troops fighting in V ietnam. After their withdrawal, the Golden Triangle laboratories exported directly to the United States, capturing one - third of the American heroin market.\" 399 Thus it was that the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate had developed a close working relat ionship with the CIA. Sam Giancana's family biographers stated flatly that Giancana claimed that in exchange for the underworld services of the Organized Crime"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"[152] Final Judgment 213 Syndicate, \"the CIA looked the other way — allowing over $100 million a year in illicit drugs to flow through Havana into the United States. \"It was an arrangement similar to all the rest they'd made, he said. The CIA received 10 percent of the take on the sale of narcotics, which they utilized 'for their undercover slush fund.' Such illegally earned monies were stashed away by the CIA in Swiss, Italian, Bahamian, and Panamanian accounts.\" 400 Further, according to the Giancanas, when Sam Giancana was engaged in various and sundry rackets he conventionally shared his profits with other Organized Crime bosses depending on the region or activity in question. \"Largely,\" they pointed out, \"[Giancana's] international deals involved Lansky and whomever else they needed to take care of at the time.\" 401 The two primary CIA figures in Southeast Asia during the time of the Lansky - CIA drug smuggling collaboration were, interestingly enough, Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines. Shackley was chief of station for the CIA in Laos. Clines served as Shackley's immediate deputy. 402 As we saw in Chapter 11, it was Shackl ey and Clines who had supervised the CIA's Operation Mongoose, the code name for the CIA - Lansky Crime Syndicate assassination plots against Castro, operating at a headquarters on the University of Miami campus. It was this operation that came to be known a s JM/Wave. Operation Mongoose, it turns out, was under the direction of General Edward Lansdale whom, assassination researcher Bernard Fensterwald notes later \"reportedly cultivated a close relationship with the Corsican Mafia during his controversial serv ice in Vietnam.\" 403 Interestingly enough, it was Shackley and Clines — upon \"retiring\" from the CIA who set up an arms dealing agency — the Egyptian Transport Service Company. 404 \"This firm worked closely with Israel's Mossad figure Shaul Eisenberg's Aviati on Trade and Service Company .\" 405 Eisenberg, in fact, was a major player in Israel's nuclear arms development program — the very operation that created the crisis between John F. Kennedy and Israel. The plot clearly comes full circle. The role of Lansky i n all of these activities, however, has been carefully ignored, even by writers — Alfred McCoy, the notable exception — who have exposed the CIA's role in the global drug racket. COVERING UP THE LANSKY CONNECTION In Endless Enemies: The Making of an Unfriend ly World, journalist Jonathan Kwitny takes several pages to outline the CIA - backed drug trafficking networks operating out of Southeast Asia and using the CIA - allied Corsican crime families as a central distribution source. Kwitny points out the role of Ch arles \"Lucky\" Luciano in establishing the initial networks which also utilized the Sicilian crime families in the Mediterranean. Kwitny even acknowledges Alfred McCoy's work as \"the best published documentation of all of this.\" 406"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214 An Opiate for the Masses [153] However, interestingly enough, Kwitny does not once mention Meyer Lansky's pivotal role in formally establishing the Luciano - launched global drug network, despite the fact that Kwitny cited McCoy as \"the best published\" source on the history of the drug network. Nor does Kwitny make reference to Santo Trafficante, Jr., Lansky's chief lieutenant and primary heir in the global drug racket. This is all particularly interesting when one realizes that in the recent furor over the JFK assassination conspiracy (resulting from the relea se of Oliver Stone's JFK film) that Kwitny himself is one of the primary promoters of the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" According to Kwitny, the principal architect of the crime was, by his estimation, more than likely New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos M arcello — who, as we have seen, was one of Lansky's local front men. 407 Evidently Kwitny — like others who claim that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" — doesn't want to acknowledge that Meyer Lansky even existed. It is also worth mentioning as well that Lansky's friendly biographer, Robert Lacey, writing in his 1991 biography of Lansky goes to great lengths to suggest that Lansky had no part in the international drug racket. This, as we have seen, is par for the course as far as Lacey's attitude toward Lansky is concerned. However, Rachel Ehrenfeld, one of the world's leading experts on the drug combine and its connections with global terrorism, writes in her book Evil Money that \"there exists reliable evidence to the contrary. “ 408 She cites an interview she conducted wit h a former congressional special investigator for organized crime. She reports that she was \"reassured that the evidence for Lansky's illegal dealings was ample and that Lacey must have been the victim of his close dealings with Lansky's former associates and family.\" 409 FRENCH ASSASSINS? Considering the CIA's alliance with Lansky's allies in the Corsican Mafia, it is interesting to consider here that there are those who believe that the Corsican Mafia or other French elements may have played a role in th e assassination of John F. Kennedy. There is evidence, indeed, that at least one French mercenary did show up in Dallas the day JFK was slain. Writing in Reasonable Doubt, Henry Hurt explores one aspect of the so - called \"French connection\" in some detail. He describes the possible role of a French OAS terrorist in the assassination. As we saw in Chapter 6 and in Chapter 9, the OAS was comprised of CIA - backed French forces who opposed granting independence to the French colony in Arab Algeria. This led them into direct confrontation with French President Charles DeGaulle who granted Algerian independence. As a member of the Senate, as we saw in Chapter 4, John F. Kennedy had called for Algerian independence, in opposition to the OAS. Israel itself had a stake in continued French domination of Algeria in that French"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"[154] Final Judgment 215 occupation of Algeria was a direct obstacle in the path of Arab nationalism. (In Chapter 15 we will examine Israel's covert ties to the OAS.) Hurt cites a CIA document discovered in 1977 by Mary F errell, Dallas researcher: \"The document, dated April 1, 1964, reported that the French intelligence service wanted help in locating one Jean Souetre, a French OAS terrorist considered a threat to the safety of French President Charles DeGaulle. \"The docum ent asserted that Jean Souetre was in Fort Worth, Texas, on the morning of November 22, 1963. That morning President Kennedy also was in Fort Worth. A few hours later, John F. Kennedy was in Dallas, where, at 12:30 p.m. he was assassinated. Also in Dallas that afternoon was Jean Souetre. \"Within forty - eight hours of Kennedy's death, according to the query from the French, Jean Souetre was picked up by U.S. authorities in Texas. He was immediately expelled from the United States. French intelligence wanted t o ascertain whether he was expelled to Canada or Mexico. \"The French also wanted to know why the U.S. authorities had expelled Souetre. The simple purpose was to ensure the safety of President DeGaulle on his pending trip to Mexico.\" 410 Hurt notes that t he original document also noted that Souetre used the names Michel Roux and Michel Mertz. Roux happened to be in Fort Worth on November 22, having entered the country on November 19 and leaving at Laredo, Texas on December 6. He was not expelled. When ques tioned later, Souetre said that Mertz was an old enemy who often used his name and may have been trying to implicate him in misdeeds. THE HUNT CONNECTION Interestingly enough, it was CIA man E. Howard Hunt (whom we first met in Chapter 9) who was one of the CIA's point men in the dealings with Souetre and OAS intelligence 411 That the two may have been in Dallas — perhaps even together — during the time of the JFK assassination is intriguing, to say the very least and yet another of the details that, taken to gether, demonstrate continuing intimate connections between persons and institutions that have (elsewhere) been repeatedly linked to the JFK assassination conspiracy. In Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 we shall see that Israeli Mossad/ Lansky - - linked elements in New Orleans and elsewhere funneled money to the OAS for a 1962 assassination attempt against Charles DeGaulle and that, indeed, these same elements are tied directly to the JFK assassination. TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN Professor Alfred McCoy summarizes the covert links between the CIA and organized crime around the world: \"Since prohibition of narcotics in the 1920s, alliances between drug brokers and intelligence agencies have protected the global narcotics traffic."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 An Opiate for the Masses [155] Given the frequency of such allianc es, there seems a natural attraction between intelligence agencies and criminal syndicates . . . Both are practitioners of what one retired CIA operative has called the 'clandestine arts' — the basic skill of operating outside the normal channels of civil so ciety. Among all the institutions of modern society, intelligence agencies and criminal syndicates alone maintain large organizations capable of carrying out covert operations without fear of detection.\" 412 Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana's family biograp hers have written of Giancana's own elaboration on this relationship. They described how Giancana showed his brother an ancient Roman coin and declared: \"Look, this is one of the Roman gods. This one has two faces . . . two sides. That's what we are, the O utfit and the CIA — two sides of the same coin: 413 ISRAEL, THE CIA AND THE DRUG COMBINE All the evidence we have covered here suggests that the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate were indeed partners in many areas of mutual concern — not onl y in Cuba and in the Southeast Asian drug racket — but also in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And as we saw in Chapter 6, Lansky's allies in Israel stood much to benefit from American involvement in Southeast Asia. While Israel was using America's eng agement in and preoccupation with the Vietnam conflict as a means whereby Israel could flex its muscle in the Middle East, the Lansky narcotics network was using its partnership with the CIA during the Vietnam War as a cover for its drug - smuggling. And as we have seen in Chapter 8, the CIA and Israel itself had long and close ties equally as incestuous of those of the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and Israel. That Israel had its own difficulties with John F. Kennedy we have already seen. Likewise with th e Mafia and the Lansky Syndicate. In Chapter 9 we reviewed the CIA's own problems with John F. Kennedy. Clearly, this alliance of forces against JFK was such that there was really no way John F. Kennedy could have ever completed his first term in the White House."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Isra el's California Connect ion: M ickey Co hen and t he J FK Assa ssinat io n Co nspiracy The role of Meyer Lansky's West Coast Henchman — longtime Israeli loyalist Mickey Cohen — in the J F K a ssa ssina t io n co nspira cy is o ne o f hist o ry 's li tt le - kno w n stories.

When Mickey Cohen's name has appeared in numerous books and monographs relating to the JFK murder, it has only been in passing. Cohen, it would appear on the surface, deserves mention if only be cause of his involvement in Organized Crime which figures so prominently in JFK conspiracy theories. However, Cohen's intimate involvement with Israel and its international intrigue, and Cohen's dedication to advancing Israel's interests — even at the expen se of his own criminal money - making activities — needs to be examined further. The evidence we shall examine here suggests that even the death of film actress Marilyn Monroe is indeed linked to the John F. Kennedy assassination in a way never imagined. Cohen , as we shall see, was using Miss Monroe — one of John F. Kennedy's illicit liaisons — as a conduit to learn Kennedy's intentions toward Israel. There is a lot more to the story of Marilyn Monroe's affair with JFK than the tabloids have told us. COHEN'S M EM OI RS The primary source on Mickey Cohen is the Los Angeles mobster's own colorful memoirs. Cohen's memoir — Mickey Cohen: In My Own Words — is one of the more fascinating first - hand accounts of life in Organized Crime. The memoir is particularly interesting for three specific reasons: (a) it is one of the few autobiographical accounts of life in Organized Crime written by a non - Italian. Virtually all of the popular accounts of life in the mob come from former \"Mafia\" members or associates. Cohen — with the exception o f Michael Milan, whom we first met in Chapter 7 — is perhaps the only other non - Italian, non - Mafia Organized Crime leader to put his experiences in writing. (b) Cohen, as Hollywood's rackets boss, was a central player in that unique underworld that links the ent ertainment industry to Organized Crime."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 Israel’s California Connection [157] A friend and associate of the prominent and of the rich and powerful, Cohen knew where Hollywood's bodies were buried, in more ways than one.

THE CIA CONNECTION A former correspondent for Newsweek, Nugent was — on one occasion — taken into custody while in Africa on suspicion of being a CIA agent. He was released through the personal intervention of then - Secretary of State Dean Rusk. However, according to organized crime authority Art Kunkin, Nugent did have CIA connections. 414 Interestingly enough, Nugent himself once participated in a debate with JFK assassination investiga tor, A. J. Weberman, co - author of Coup d'Etat in America, where he — Nugent — sought to refute CIA complicity in the JFK assassination. In this context, one can't help but wonder if Cohen's memoirs weren't a laundered version, CIA - style. Both what does appear in Cohen's reminiscences — and what doesn't appear — are equally intriguing. Cohen's memoirs are a gold - mine of often fascinating information, particularly in regard to the Hollywood mobster's early links to Israel and its birth struggle. SUCCESSOR TO SIEGEL Cohen was the West Coast successor to Meyer Lansky's ill - fated boyhood crony, Benjamin Siegel, Organized Crime's top man on the West Coast until his bloody assassination on June 20, 1947. Remembered best as \"the man who invented Las Vegas,\" the handsome S iegel was shot dead in the Beverly Hills home of his second wife, mob playgirl Virginia Hill. Lansky and Siegel were longtime friends and early partners in Brooklyn at the beginning of their initial reach into the upper echelons of Organized Crime. The oft - told tales of New York's \"Bug and Meyer Mob\" are legendary in the annals of Organized Crime. \"Bug and Meyer\" were treacherous killers in those early years. There's no reason to think that Lansky mellowed with age. Believed by Organized Crime's ruling comm ission of looting funds earmarked for the casino network he was establishing in Las Vegas on behalf of the syndicate, Siegel was slain in retribution for his betrayal. This was said to be a great personal loss for his friend, Lansky. LANSKY ORDERS THE HIT Yet, Lansky himself apparently agreed to the decision that Siegel had to be executed. Lansky even agreed to handle the arrangements if necessary."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"[158] Final Judgment 219 Apparently he did. \"I had no choice,\" Lansky later said, reflecting upon his friend's betrayal and its con sequences. 415 (The best accounts of Siegel's role in the development of the Las Vegas front for the Lansky Crime Syndicate appear in The Green Felt Jungle by Ed Reid and Ovid Demaris and We Only Kill Each Other, a biography of Siegel written by Dean Jenni ngs). HOOVER SENDS HIS SYMPATHIES In Chapter 7 we explored the FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's seeming inability to acknowledge the existence of the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate as well as Hoover's connections to Israel's American - based intelligence a nd propaganda agency, the Lansky Syndicate - financed Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith. (We shall discuss the ADL in further detail in Chapter 17.) Michael Milan (whom we first met in Chapter 7 as a mutual associate of both Hoover and Lansky) say s that when the hit was ordered on Ben Siegel, \"Even [J. Edgar Hoover] himself had to concur and told everybody to stand away. He sent Meyer Lansky his personal condolences, however, because he had liked Benny, and Benny had showed him a good time whenever he went to the Coast.\" 416 Whatever the circumstances, it was, in fact Mickey Cohen who assumed Siegel's position as Lansky's West Coast representative upon Siegel's assassination. LANSKY'S 'EYES AND EARS' According to Lansky's biographer, Hank Messick, it was Cohen who was Lansky's real \"eyes and ears\" in Southern California — not his good friend Siegel. One of Cohen's primary responsibilities was keeping an eye on the free - wheeling and reckless Siegel on Lansky's behalf. When Siegel was removed from the s cene it was Cohen who stepped in and took charge of Lansky's West Coast affairs — quite a fortuitous set of circumstances for the simian thug who could — by no means — ever have competed with Siegel in a beauty contest. No wonder then that Cohen recalled in his memoirs, \"I have a great love and respect and a complete high regard for Meyer Lansky.\" 417 COHEN & ISRAEL Aside, however, from his direct ties to Lansky, and his own intra - mob machinations, Mickey Cohen was in the State of Israel's camp from the very b eginning of its existence — even before. By his own admission, Cohen was engaged in arms smuggling and fund - raising for Israel even before Israel had become a state."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 Israel’s California Connection [159] In his memoirs Cohen recalls his first encounter with an agent of Israel's international f und - raising and arms - smuggling operations and how he came to identify with Israel's cause. Speaking of his crony, Mike Howard, Cohen recounted the day that Howard introduced him to an Israeli operative. (In his memoirs Cohen does not name the Israeli in qu estion.) Howard, he says, \"knew that I would do anything for a cause that was right, and particularly Jewish causes.\" 418 At first, Cohen says, he was hesitant to become involved. He changed his mind, though. \"So they come back,\" Cohen recalled, \"and we si t down to talk. And the guy tells me this story about the Haganah, which was organized by the David Ben - Gurion guy. And he tells me especially about the Irgun and the type of war they're fighting against the British, and the type of guys they are and all t his. And I got high on him. \"But you know when you're kinky [i.e. criminally - oriented] your mind runs kinky. I still figured this must be a racket thing. So I says to the guy, Tookit, I don't know nothing about these things. I didn't even know there was a war going on in Israel. Let me think it over.” 419 Cohen made no decision, one way or the other, but after Hollywood screenwriter, publicist and playwright Ben Hecht — an ardent advocate of the Zionist cause — came visiting, Cohen began to see the light. Hecht appeared at Cohen's headquarters accompanied by a representative of the bloody terrorist Irgun gang. The individual, once again, Cohen did not name. \"I could see that I was dealing with a real man, no con guy,\" 420 remembered Cohen. MENACHEM BEGIN COMES TO TOWN In his own memoirs Jimmy (\"the Weasel\") Fratianno, a top West Coast Mafia figure - turned - government informant, gives us a hint as to who Cohen's Irgun friend may have been. Fratianno described a benefit for Israel at an exclusive Bel Air home: \"Aft er [Cohen's] little speech, we start moving around the room and Mickey's rabbi introduces us to a guy called Menachem Begin, who's the boss of the Irgun, an underground outfit in Palestine. This guy's wearing a black armband and he tells us he's wanted bac k there for bombing a hotel that killed almost a hundred people. He's a fucking lamster [i.e. on the run]. \"Anyway, he makes a speech, and after him just about everybody made a speech. It just goes on and on. Afterwards these other guys from the Haganah, a nother underground outfit, start arguing with Begin about who's going to handle the money. So Mickey chirps in and it's agreed that his rabbi will handle the money and Mickey will buy guns and ammo and ship them over there. \" 421 [This, as we shall see, woul d not be the last time that Menachem Begin would be spotted in the company of Mickey Cohen, however.] Fratianno frankly doubted Cohen's sincerity and suspected that Cohen was in \"the cause\" for the mo ney to b e made. Ho wever, in his o wn"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"[160] Final Judgment 221 memoirs, Cohen was insistent about his dedication to Israel. In fact, he goes on at length about his devotion. \"I got engrossed with the goddamn thing pretty strong see. Through my connections I made everybody throughout the country — the Italians, the Jews, the Irish — set up whatever positions there were to be helpful to the Israel cause.\" 422 DEDICATED TO ISRAEL Cohen's dedication was inestimable. He was so devoted to Israel, indeed, that he allowed his criminal activities to go by the wayside. Cohen says: \"Now I got so eng rossed with Israel that I actually pushed aside a lot of my activities and done nothing but what was involved with this Irgun war. It's a nature of mine, see. Either I go whole hog or nothing. So I got involved with this goddamn Israel war for three years. I started to have relationships with Irgun members back in Israel. They got to understand me better and I got to understand them better. \"Well, I had raised considerable money, not particularly myself, but through me, throughout the country. There were di nners held in Boston, Philadelphia, Miami. And plenty of armament and equipment was collected that you couldn't possibly get. \"It was only God's will that Harry Truman was President. He couldn't openly allow it to be known that he was okaying stuff to be s hipped back there or that stuff was being stolen from the ships that were coming back from the Second World War. \"But it was only with Truman's looking the other way, or with his being in favor, that it was done. To me, he was the greatest man in the world , Harry Truman, because of what he done for Israel and because he made it available for us to do. \"We were able to get on ships that were being put into mothballs. I had access to all that stuff on the docks. Some of the stuff and equipment like machine gu ns that we got back to Israel had never got a chance to be used in the Second World War. They weren't even put together. They were still in the cases, in the straw, in the oil and everything. We shipped them right over.\" 423 JACK RUBY COMES TO TOWN It wa s during this same time that Cohen was also making the acquaintance of another thug, Jack Rubinstein, who ultimately changed his last name to Ruby. Gary Wean — whose business it was to keep an eye on Cohen's activities — later put his fascinating experiences d own in an informal memoir entitled There's a Fish in the Courthouse. Wean's contributions to Kennedy assassination research, however, have not received the widespread recognition they deserve."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222 Israel’s California Connection [161] A detective sergeant for the Los Angeles Police Department, W ean got to know Mickey Cohen well. What's more, as a Criminal Intelligence Investigator for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Bureau of Investigation, Wean was privy to much \"inside\" information about Cohen and his activities in Hollywood. Later, Wean wa s chief investigator for the Ventura County Public Defenders Office until 1970. He is now retired. In his memoirs, Wean says he saw Ruby twice in Hollywood in 1946 and in 1947. The first time Ruby was riding with Cohen in Cohen's big black limousine, altho ugh, on that occasion, they were not introduced. 424 The second time he encountered Ruby was a year later. According to Wean, he and his partner went to a club known as Harry's Place. Ruby was there, and Wean introduced himself and informed Ruby he was a po lice officer. In turn, Ruby introduced himself. He said: \"My name is Jack Ruby. I just came out from Chicago to get with Harry. Since the war's over the West Coast is dead, so is Chicago, We're moving 'everything' to New Orleans and Miami. That is where al l the action is going to be from now, between the United States and Cuba.\" 425 (A New Orleans chief assistant district attorney has essentially confirmed Ruby's claim that the Crescent City had become a hub of syndicate financing and activity. According to the prosecutor, \"There is too much money here. We feel that it's flowing in from other Cosa Nostra [Mafia] organizations in other parts of the country for investment by the local mobs. This could be their financial center, with a lot of nice safe places w here campaign contributions and outright bribery have pretty well insulated them from the law.\") 426 In any case, as we shall see, this was just the beginning of Jack Ruby's relationship with Mickey Cohen and Cohen's West Coast associates. It wasn't until 1963, however, that the relationship came full circle, as we shall see in Chapter 14. COHEN, MARILYN MONROE AND JFK By 1960, Cohen was an established power in the West Coast syndicate operations of Meyer Lansky. And Cohen was also a key figure in Hollywo od, nurturing his relationships with the film colony there — for his own insidious purposes. As author John Davis notes: \"One of Cohen's rackets was sexually compromising Hollywood stars for the purpose of blackmail. It had been Cohen who engineered the torr id affair between his accomplice, Johnny Stompanato, and [film star] Lana Turner, in the hope of getting pictures of the two in bed together.\" 427 [Miss Turner's daughter later killed Stompanato in an event that became a major Hollywood scandal.] But Cohen 's activities went further. Cohen was also manipulating beautiful screen star Marilyn Monroe for yet another purpose — one which had international implications. Now as the legend goes, it was ostensibly the Frank Sinatra connection that led to the introducti on of Marilyn Monroe to John F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"[162] Final Judgment 223 However, according to Gary Wean, it was in fact the Mickey Cohen connection that brought the handsome Massachusetts Senator and the Hollywood sex symbol together. Wean reveals that Cohen's close friend, entertaine r Joey Bishop — who also happened to be a member of Sinatra's famous clique known as \"the rat pack\" — was the one who actually set up the circumstances that led to the initial liaison between JFK and Miss Monroe during the 1960 presidential campaign. \"It was J oey Bishop that came up with the 'idea of a wild party' for Kennedy. He talked [Peter] Lawford [JFK's brother - in - law] into it.\" 428 According to Wean, there was a reason for all of this — beyond satisfying JFK's notorious appetite for beautiful women: \"Bishop knew Kennedy would be taken by the Monroe sex appeal. Bishop was a Jew and real tight with Cohen. \"At that time the rabbis were pushing them hard as hell to squeeze every bit of dough they could get out of Hollywood for Israel. [Menachem] Begin was spendi ng more time hanging around Cohen in Hollywood than in Israel. Begin desperately wanted to know what Kennedy's plan was for Israel if he became president. \"Cohen figured if they could duke Marilyn into Kennedy, [Cohen's pimp Georgie] Piscitelli would be ab le to manipulate her and tell them everything Kennedy told her. Also they'd work a [blackmail] squeeze [against JFK] if a romance blossomed. Cohen also had something going on with Jack Ruby. His girl friend, [a stripper by the name of] Candy Barr, was maki ng a lot of trips between Ruby in Dallas and Cohen in Hollywood.\" 429 According to Wean, Cohen's pimp was also sleeping with Miss Monroe. Wean learned this from a young lady named Mary Mercandante who was jealous of Piscitelli's relationship with Miss Monro e. Miss Mercandante was a prostitute and Piscitelli was her pimp. JFK'S VIEWS TOWARD ISRAEL? It was from Miss Mercandante that Wean learned something which he came to describe as \"the really weird stuff.\" 430 Miss Mercandante told Wean that Piscitelli's job was to pump Miss Monroe for information about JFK's views toward Israel. (As we have seen in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, Israel and its American lobby were uneasy, to say the very least, about Kennedy.) However, according to Wean, Piscitelli told Miss Me rcandante that Marilyn would get upset when he began pressing her, saying she didn't know anything about politics. Wean reports that Miss Mercandante told him that: \"Cohen got mad and told Georgie to stick with Marilyn and pour drinks or pills down her, wh atever it takes and find out what John Kennedy intended to do about financing Israel.\" 431 According to Wean's source: \"Cohen and Begin were plenty upset over Kennedy's plans to give billions of dollars to the Peace Corps, and the South American and African countries.\" 432"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"224 Israel’s California Connection [163] Miss Mercandante began threatening to reveal all she knew about Cohen's manipulation of the film actress and the affair with Kennedy. Wean, however, had already reported his findings to his superiors. TWO MURDERS? Miss Mercandante was later murdered. She appears to be yet another of the many victims of what ultimately evolved into the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up. Now although there has long been widespread suspicion that Marilyn Monroe was herself perhaps murdered, the tab loids would have us believe that she was murdered by the Kennedy family to keep silent about her affair with the President and — allegedly also — his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The evidence we have seen here, however, suggests that if Miss Monro e was murdered it indeed was to keep her silent — but for an entirely different reason. If Miss Monroe ever revealed that Mickey Cohen had used her to find out Kennedy's stance toward Israel, it would have opened a Pandora's Box that could have exposed Israe l's uneasy relationship with JFK — something that Israel and its American lobby could not afford. What is interesting is that in his memoirs — which are filled with Cohen's incessant name - dropping and accounts of his friendships with a bevy of Hollywood figure s — Cohen never once mentions Marilyn Monroe. Nor does he mention Jack Ruby, for that matter either. There were evidently certain things that Cohen and his co - author did not see fit to mention. It is more than interesting to note, at least in passing, that M eyer Lansky himself had \"inside\" knowledge on the extra - marital affairs of Attorney General Robert Kennedy at the very least. According to J. Edgar Hoover biographer Curt Gentry, Lansky was overheard on a federal wiretap on August 1, 1962 telling his wife, Teddy, that Robert Kennedy was carrying on an affair with a woman in El Paso, Texas. 4 33 WHAT WERE THEY UP TO? In any event, Mickey Cohen's strange activities were of continuing particular interest to Gary Wean. Wean described in his memoirs how he firs t discovered the close working relationship between Cohen and Israeli terrorist - turned - roving diplomat (and later Israeli Prime Minister) Menachem Begin, whose Hollywood activities we reviewed earlier in this chapter: \"[My partner] and I'd been watching Mi ckey Cohen from a distance. We knew he was up to something out of the ordinary. He spent a lot of time with a weird - looking little guy at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lunch counter and drug store area."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"[164] Final Judgment 225 \"What got our curiosity most was Mickey seemed to be t aking orders from the stranger. We got photos with our telescopic lens of Cohen and his friend. The office checked it out. We learned his name: Menachem Begin.\" 434 To find out further what Cohen and Begin were involved with, Wean deployed a Yiddish - speakin g spy to listen in on Cohen and Begin's conversations. Wean notes: \"He reported that the two in a deep discussion were very excitable. There was a lot of talk about Cuba and military operations and the Kennedys.\" 435 According to Wean's operative: \"We've re ally got something going. Mickey sounded like a politician. They were going on about war and billion dollar appropriations, cursing JFK about his crazy Peace Corps and wasting money.\" 436 MELVIN BELLI According to Wean, after this coffee shop conference, Cohen and Begin departed. Wean and his partner followed Cohen to an elegant home in Los Angeles. There, Wean says, Cohen and Begin met with high - priced lawyer Melvin Belli, Cohen's longtime friend and attorney. 437 Belli, we shall see in Chapter 14, came to play an important role in the tangled web of intrigue surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Belli served as attorney for Jack Ruby. Interestingly enough, according to Wean, Cohen, Ruby and Menachem Begin shared one other thing in common: Cohen was shar ing his girlfriend, stripper Candy Barr, with not only Ruby (then operating in Dallas), but also with Begin, Israel's man in Hollywood. 438 However, Mickey Cohen had a lot more on his mind than his criminal activities and his sexual pursuits. Cohen was inte rested in the survival of Israel, the nation he had helped establish. COHEN'S MISSION Cohen's peculiar interest in JFK's Middle East policy, coupled with his unfortunate manipulation of Marilyn Monroe, along with his longtime devotion to the Zionist caus e, places him squarely in the midst of the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate's central part in the JFK assassination conspiracy. The simian - like Los Angeles thug was very much privy to the circumstances of what really took place in the JFK assassination. Wh at Cohen may have known, however, was lost forever when the Lansky henchman died suddenly of a heart attack. He had no known history of heart trouble. In Chapter 14 we shall examine Cohen's connection with Jack Ruby in more detail. Years after his encounte r with Cohen and Begin, Gary Wean received what he described as \"a strange call.\" It was from a writer named Ed Tivnan who said he was looking into Begin's alleged association with American gangsters."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"226 Israel’s Calfornia Connection [165] COVERING FOR ISRAEL \"My book's purpose is to deny, d ispel and silence the accusations of Begin's criminal associations with them,\" 439 said Tivnan. Tivnan was not interested in Wean's account of Begin's very real association with the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. It was something that Israel did not wan t told. There is another interesting sidelight to all of this. When author Anthony Summers was preparing his book Goddess , a life of Marilyn Monroe, he contacted Wean for information and Wean provided Summers with all of the details we've reviewed in thes e pages. However, when Summers' biography of Miss Monroe finally hit the bookstores, the author had nothing to say about Cohen and the Israeli connection. Instead, the book suggested that Miss Monroe's death was a proximate result of her affair with the Ke nnedy brothers. Indeed, the book led the reader to believe that it was the Kennedys who were, one way or the other, responsible — directly or indirectly — for the young woman's tragic death. The Mickey Cohen - Israel connection went unmentioned. There is somethi ng else interesting. This same Anthony Summers is the Anthony Summers who wrote an exhaustive study of the JFK assassination entitled Conspiracy. (This was before he met with Wean.) H o w e v e r , w h e n S u m m e r s r e l e a s e d a n u p - d a t e d e d i t i o n o f h i s b o o k i n 1 9 9 2 , he n e v er r e p o r te d t he i n f o rm a ti o n t h a t W ea n p r o v i d e d h i m a b o u t t h e I s r a e l i c o n n e c t i o n . I t i s l i k e l y , i n a l l fairness to Summers, that he probably did not understand the significance of what he had learned. However, it is very clear, considering everything th at we have already examined in these pages — and what we are about to examine — that Wean's discovery was a key to understanding what really happened on November 22, 1963. THE COHEN CONNECTION Today, there are those, as we have seen, who continually cite Jac k Ruby's connections with organized crime as proof that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" Some have even pointed out that one of Ruby's first telephone calls he made immediately after the JFK assassination (just shortly after Lee Harvey Oswald had been arrested) was to Al Gruber, a Mickey Cohen associate in Hollywood. Gruber, it also turns out — perhaps not surprisingly — was associated with Lansky's Mexico City syndicate drug - smuggling connection, \"Happy\" Meltzer, with whom, as we shall see in Chapter 14, Ruby had his o wn connections. 440 In fact, although Ruby had not seen Gruber in some ten years, Gruber came to visit Ruby in Dallas in November of 1963, just shortly before the assassination."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"[166] Final Judgment 227 Other than this, the Cohen - Ruby link is given little play — perhaps precisely because it points not in the direction of the Mafia, but instead, more directly to Israel and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. As it stands, ironically enough, Mickey Cohen was already incarcerated in federal prison by the time of the JFK assass ination. Lansky's West Coast lieutenant was one of many \"big names\" snared in the Kennedy war against the Lansky crime syndicate. There was clearly no love lost between Mickey Cohen and the Kennedy brothers. It seems likely — and Gary Wean believes, as he to ld this author — that Cohen's henchman Gruber was the intermediary for the Lansky syndicate in the delicate matter of how to silence the patsy — Oswald — who had somehow escaped being killed and was then in the custody of the Dallas police. Mickey Cohen and Mena chem Begin very clearly were involved in the initial stages of what ultimately evolved into the JFK assassination conspiracy precisely because of Kennedy's difficult foreign policy struggle with Israel which sparked the plot against the American president. Perhaps this might explain why Jack Ruby — in his final days — was fearful that if the truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy ever came out that, as Ruby put it, \"the Jews\" would be blamed for the crime. 441 In the next chapter we will examine Jack R uby's role further and consider his connections with the Lansky syndicate — and with Israel."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Chapter Fourteen The Errand Boy: Jack Ruby Was More \"Mossad\" Than \"Mafia\" J a c k R u b y ' s c o n ne ct i o ns t o t h e c r i mi n a l u n d er w o rl d a r e well - documented.

Organized crime historian Stephen Fox has called Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby \"the smoking gun , the stone, the trout in the milk\" in the JFK assassination conspiracy. 442 Ironically, not only did Ruby silence Oswald and help perpetuate the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up, but he also added fuel to the fire of speculation as a consequence. Had Lee Harvey Oswald died of a heart attack in the Dallas jail, rather than at the hands of a mob - linked thug named Jack Ruby, suspicion of a conspiracy might not have evolved so quickly. Yet, when Jack Ruby stepped into the public limelight and eliminat ed Oswald, attention was focused on the strange background of the Chicago - born underworld figure who had killed the alleged assassin. Ruby's criminal ties are legendary. But Jack Ruby was not — repeat not — \"Mafia.\" And he was more than just a \"Mafia associate .\" Ruby, in fact, was very much a part of the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate and, what's more — the Warren Commission's conclusions notwithstanding — was also working for Lansky's longtime collaborators in the CIA and with Israel's Mossad (documented in detail i n Chapter 8.) The late Bernard Fensterwald, one of the leading JFK assassination researchers, documented Ruby's Lansky connection in his encyclopedic work, Coincidence or Conspiracy: \"Ruby told the Warren Commission on June 7, 1964 about his 1959 visit to [Lewis] McWillie in Havana, and also spoke of kno wing McWillie's bosses. Interestingly enough, McWillie's bosses at that time were Meyer and Jake Lansky. Ruby mysteriously spoke of meeting two brothers who'd owned the Tropicana Casino which McWillie manage d. Ruby said he was unsure of their last name but thought it had been Fox. It has long been known that Meyer and Jake Lansky were in fact the two key Tropicana owners. The Tropicana had been a cornerstone of their Cuban holdings."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"[168] Final Judgment 229 \"Ruby also described 'th e Fox brothers' as 'the greatest that have been expelled from Cuba,' and said they were then living in Miami. Meyer and Jake Lansky were known as the most prominent Syndicate men expelled by the Castro government and were in fact then living in Miami. Ruby said he thought one of the 'Fox brothers' first names may have been Martin. \"Ruby further testified that one of the 'Fox brothers' had later visited him in Dallas, accompanied by Lewis McWillie. Ruby claimed that they had dined at the Dallas airport toget her. Ruby further testified that Fox and McWillie had also subsequently dropped by his nightclub, where they posed for photographs with him. Ruby later took the photos with him when he visited McWillie in Cuba: \"'Evidently the Foxes were in exile at that t ime, because when I went to visit McWillie . . . [Cuban officials] looked through my luggage and they saw a photograph of Mr. Fox and his wife. \"'They didn't interrogate but they went through everything and held me up for hours . . . Evidently in my ignora nce I didn't realize I was bringing a picture [of someone] they knew was a bitter enemy.\" 443 There is some question, however, as to whether or not the \"Fox brothers\" were, in fact, the Lansky brothers. Ruby biographer Seth Kantor notes that there were br others named Martin and Pedro Fox who were Cuban nationals and involved in the Tropicana. (Nonetheless, the Tropicana was owned by the Lansky brothers.) Kantor writes: \"The significance of all this marching up and down the hill about the Fox brothers is th at Ruby was a rational man at the time of the Warren Commission's June 7, 1964 interview with him. He was telling them the truth, and begged to be taken out of Texas so he could tell them more. But no one listened, on one of the sorriest days in the Warren Commission's history.” 444 It is interesting to note that at the time of the JFK assassination Ruby's good friend McWillie was working at the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, owned in part by Meyer Lansky and his brother Jake. As Peter Dale Scott succinctl y summarizes it: \"In other words, McWillie was working for the Lanskys when Ruby made seven phone calls to him in 1963.” 445 These were among the phone calls made to organized crime - related figures that authors David Scheim and John W. Davis and G. Robert Blakey have used to promote the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" Ruby did indeed call some seven or eight mob - linked individuals in the period just before the JFK assassination, but, according to Peter Dale Scott, \"only one of these was Italian.\" 446 Ye t, as Scott points out, Blakey's House Assassinations Committee preferred to cast Ruby as a \"Mafia\" figure and to ignore his positioning in the Lansky sphere. \"Only from officials,\" Scott notes wryly, \"can logic like this be encountered.\" 447 In general Sco tt describes this as a form of \"conscious bias, or what might be called contrived bias, the purpose of which is to deceive others. \" 448 Whatever the direct link between Lansky and Ruby in this regard, however, JFK assassination researcher Jim Marrs states flatly that Ruby had"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 The Errand Boy [169] a share in a gambling house in Hallandale, Florida along with Meyer and Jake Lansky, among others, in the early 1950s. 449 There is no doubt that Ruby and Lansky's world of intrigue intersected in several arenas, as we shall see — whe ther the two actually ever were personally acquainted or not. RUBY AND THE LANSKY DRUG RACKET Peter Dale Scott has scored G. Robert Blakey and his House Assassinations Committee for its dismal failure to explore and to expose Ruby's Lansky connections wh ich are very strong indeed. Scott, who has studied Jack Ruby's criminal antecedents, has outlined Ruby's critical positioning in the Lansky syndicate. According to Scott: \"It is certain that Ruby was investigated [in the mid - 1940's] for his role in [an] in ternational drug - trafficking syndicate, involving corruption of government officials in Mexico City.\" 4 50 The top syndicate representative in Mexico City was one Harold \"Happy\" Meltzer, but, in fact, it was Meyer Lansky who was \"the key figure in the Meltz er syndicate.” 451 According to Scott, \"Right after World War II this was probably the biggest drug - smuggling channel into the United States.\" 452 The House Assassinations Committee, in Scott's judgment, failed to note that \"Ruby was in some way an importa nt figure\" 453 in the linkage between organized crime and the political arena in Dallas and \"on a federal level.\" 454 Ruby, in short, was no mere mob hanger - on as some have tried to suggest and he was not, by any stretch of the imagination, part of \"the Mafi a\" as G. Robert Blakey and some others have suggested. RUBY WAS NOT 'MAFIA' According to Scott, the House Committee investigation of Ruby and his underworld associates chose to focus on what Scott describes as an \"ethnic model of organized crime as 'La C osa Nostra'\" 455 — that is, focusing on the so - called \"Mafia,\" the popularized media sobriquet for Italian elements in the organized crime underworld, rather than upon the more substantially predominant Jewish elements personified by Meyer Lansky and those in his sphere of influence. According to Scott, these descriptions of organized crime \"are bureaucratically distorted to the point of falsehood . . . [and that] this distortion involved systematic distortion of the facts, not just about Ruby, but about other aspects of the Kennedy assassination.\" 456 In Scott's assessment, the House Assassinations Committee investigation of Jack Ruby omitted any reference to what he delicately d e s c r i b e s a s \" t h e o n g o i n g , d r u g - f u e l e d , i n t e l l i g e n c e - m o b connection\" 457 — what we, in the pages of Final Judgment, more correctly and precisely call the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"[170] Final Judgment 231 As Scott has concluded (and rightly so): \"The so - called Cosa Nostra has been systematically misrepresented by law enforcement investigators and prosec utors. For this active misrepresentation has deformed the two official investigations into the Kennedy assassination itself, not in marginal ways, but so as to conceal central truths about the assassination, truths that were embarrassing to those conductin g the investigation. \"In the end one comes to recognize that the history of organized crime and the history of the investigation and prosecution of organized crime are closely intertwined processes affecting one another. Processes, one must add, which mutu ally affect the truth, but concealed, seats of political power in this country. ” 458 \"To sum up: official investigations of the Kennedy assassination have failed, not because the case is inherently insoluble, but because both the case and the investigation s have been governed by deeper political processes, which have not yet been discerned.\" 459 In short, Jack Ruby was not a \"Mafia” hireling, but, instead, a key point man in Dallas for the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate and, ultimately, as Stephen Fox has sai d, \"the smoking gun, the Rosetta stone, the trout in the milk\" in the JFK assassination conspiracy. The deeper political processes of which Peter Dale Scott has noted \"have not yet been discerned\" are now, however, in the pages of Final Judgment, being bar ed for the first time. RUBY'S ISRAELI CONNECTIONS Now although Jack Ruby was long known to be proud of his Jewish heritage, what is little known is that Ruby himself had an intimate connection with an individual with deep ties to the world of intelligenc e and to the pro - Israel lobby in the United States. This was Ruby's \"longtime associate and former lawyer, ” 460 Luis Kutner of Chicago, who had represented Ruby when Ruby was called before the staff of the Kefauver Senate Rackets Committee in 1950 to discu ss underworld activities in his former home base of Chicago. According to Kutner, Ruby's offer was contingent upon the condition that the Kefauver Committee stay away from investigating organized crime in Dallas where Ruby was by then ensconced. Peter Dale Scott notes that \"The performance of the Kefauver Committee would seem to corroborate Kutner's claim, for the Committee did give Dallas a clean bill of health.\" 461 Although a \"mob lawyer,” it seems, Kutner did have additional interesting connections. Acco rding to Scott, \"Kutner, by his own account, had known Ruby since 1936, when he had used Ruby to 'run errands' in his unsuccessful 1936 congressional campaign. Later Kutner had inserted himself into what can only be described as international intelligence operations, ranging from Latin American coups to the defense of ousted Congolese leader Moise Tshombe.\" 462 But Kutner was himself also active in efforts to advance the interests of Israel. He was among a host of people who formed the Center for Global"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 Final Judgment [171] Se curity, Inc., which he served as \"honorary counsel.\" Serving as \"honorary chairman\" of this pro - Israel lobbying group was General Julius Klein, an American military figure who not only played a major role in supplying weapons to the Israeli Haganah undergr ound prior to the establishment of Israel, but also assisted in the founding and training of the Israeli Mossad. Clearly, Jack Ruby's friend and lawyer, Kutner, was a man with important ties to Israel and its global power networks. So, what Peter Dale Scot t says regarding Ruby's association with Kutner is not an overstatement: \"[Kutner's] involvement with Ruby confirms that Ruby should not just be thought of as a man with local influence with the Dallas police, but as a player in international deep politics .\" 463 Yet, when G. Robert Blakey and the House Assassinations Committee were looking into Ruby's connections and when Blakey later wrote about his findings, Blakey never once mentioned Kutner — a significant Ruby connection, particularly in light of what we have already outlined — and will examine further — in the pages of Final Judgment. 464 RUBY AND ISRAELI ARMS SMUGGLING JFK researcher A. J. Weberman has revealed the little - known fact that Ruby traveled to Israel in 1955 and that while in San Francisco that year, Ruby told a friend, \"After I leave here I'm going to Florida to buy a load of contraband to send to Israel.\" Ruby's notebook also contained the phone number in New York City belonging to a Miss Snyman who told the FBI she had diplomatic immunity and that she should be contacted through the South African ambassador to the United Nations. Weberman raised the question as to whether this suggested Ruby might have been involved in an arms deal between Israel and South Africa, but noted that the FBI had th en decided the number was JE - 8 - 7475 rather than TE - 8 - 7475. Who that number belonged to was apparently never resolved. 465 In addition, citing FBI documents, Weberman notes that Lawrence Meyers, Ruby's long - time friend with whom he met at the Cabana Motel t he night before the JFK assassination was a salesman for Ero Manufacturing. The FBI determined that calls were made from Ero to a corporation investigated for illegal arms shipments to Israel. 466 There is, in fact, evidence of other Ruby connections to Isr ael at the time of the JFK assassination itself. It is well known that while Ruby was milling about the Dallas Police Department after the assassination that Ruby claimed to be translating for Israeli \"reporters\" who were on the scene. This is interesting, obviously, in that it seems unlikely that Israeli correspondents in the United States would have English capabilities so lacking they required the services of a Dallas strip club operator. While Ruby's association with these Israeli reporters may have bee n completely innocent, what is interesting is that neither the Warren Commission nor any enterprising JFK researchers (many of whom look askance at Final Judgment) never tracked down these reporters. Why not?"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"[172] Final Judgment 233 At one conference of JFK assassination resear chers one attendee created a bit of a stir when he asked if anyone had ever determined precisely which Israeli newspapers Jack Ruby was translating for and whether anyone ever interviewed those reporters to find out what Ruby may have said to them in those critical hours while Ruby was stalking Oswald. The answer that the master of ceremonies, researcher Walt Brown, gave was revealing in its own fashion. Brown said — in words to this effect — \"That may be the most important question asked at this conference.\" 4 67 What may, in the end, be mo st telling about Rub y's Mossad connections came out as late as 2003 when William F. Pepper, longtime attorney for Martin Luther King's alleged assassin, James Earl Ray, published his book An Act of State. In that book Pepper asserted that in 1963 Ruby was involved in an international arms smuggling operation — based in part in Texas — which involved \"a senior Mossad agent working in South America who acted as a senior liaison to the U.S. military and CIA.\"' 468 Perhaps not surpris ingly, Pepper did not elaborate on the Mossad connection. However, Pepper's circumspect reference to the Mossad was a lightning bolt of recall to anyone who had already read Final Judgment. Pepper's assertion involving the Mossad link to the arms smuggling operation involving Ruby is based on statements made to one of Pepper's investigators by former Colonel John Downie of the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, a unit based inside the Department of Defense. According to Downie, the mysterious figure \"Raul\" — whom King's accused assassin, James Earl Ray, claimed had helped frame him (Ray) for King's murder — was part of a U.S. - based international arms smuggling operation that Pepper had already determined — through other sources — involved Jack Ruby. The link between \"Raul\" and Ruby was by no means tenuous: \"Raul\" and Ruby were placed together by Pepper's sources on numerous occasions prior to the JFK assassination — five years before King's murder. 469 The smuggling operation utilized weapons stolen from U.S. Army base s and armories which were delivered to the New Orleans - based Carlos Marcello organized crime organization which, in turn, delivered those arms for sale in Latin and South America and elsewhere. The proceeds from the arms deals were reportedly split equally with the U.S. 902nd Military Intelligence Group using its cut for financing covert, off - budget, operations. It appears the previously published Final Judgment had almost certainly already pinpointed the identity of the individual described by Pepper's sou rce. In the photo section of Final Judgment, it is pointed out that the famous \"umbrella man\" who was photographed in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 bore a remarkable resemblance to no less than the now - infamous (but then shadowy) longtime Mossad figure, Michael Harari. In 1963, Harari was in the field as a top Mossad's assassinations specialist and would have assuredly been in Dallas if the Mossad was a prime player in the JFK conspiracy. In addition, the published record"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"234 The Errand Boy [173] documents that — througho ut his career — Harari was heavily involved in Israeli intelligence operations in Mexico, South America and the Caribbean, culminating in his later more widely - publicized role as the top advisor to then - Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega who was ultimately t opped in a U.S. invasion. Was Harari, then, the \"senior Mossad agent working in South America\" referenced by Pepper's U.S. military source? If not, it was certainly someone Harari worked with. That Jack Ruby — who was part of the Mossad - connected smuggling o peration uncovered by Pepper — had multiple Mossad and Israeli connections is no surprise to those who had already read Final Judgment (Later, in the question - and - answer section of Final Judgment, we will explore further strange Israeli connections to the Ma rtin Luther King affair — details that have been deliberately otherwise suppressed.) RUBY AND THE BRONFMAN FAMILY Jack Ruby's covert activities were clearly well - established. But independent researcher Brian Downing Quig came up with a Ruby connection that had never before been revealed. Exploring the corrupt world of Arizona mob bagman and political boss Kemper Marley, linked to the infamous 1976 murder of investigative reporter Don Bolles, Quig learned from Marley's longtime publicist Al Lizanetz that not only had the Lansky - linked Bronfman bootlegging family been Marley's sponsors, but also that Jack Ruby himself was also on the Bronfman family's payroll. 470 So when we consider the Bronfman family's intimate ties to the Permindex entity (that, as we shal l see in Chapter 15, clearly played a central role in the JFK conspiracy) the Ruby connection to the Bronfman family is interesting indeed and does point further to an Israeli connection. RUBY AND THE CIA All of the evidence of Ruby's gun - running, both t o Castro himself and, ultimately to anti - Castro Cuban exiles, has been explored relentlessly, and in detail, by JFK assassination researchers. But his Lansky connection has been repeatedly ignored. Former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow reports that Ruby' s pro - Castro gun - running was done in conjunction with former Cuban president Carlos Prio Socarras. (Prio, also, had a long history of close association with Meyer Lansky, as we saw in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11, having received lucrative Lansky pay - offs.) Ac cording to Morrow: \"With the blessing of the syndicate and the guidance of the CIA, Prio made his deal with Castro, arranging for the Mafia (which was also supporting Batista) to supply the necessary arms and finances to make Castro's revolution successful — on the condition that Fidel would reinstate him as president once Batista was overthrown. Castro agreed, and Prio turned into a high - class gun - runner. One of his partners would be Jack Ruby of Dallas, Texas, then known as Jack Rubinstein. This is supporte d by a Miami FBI informant named Blaney Mack Johnson who"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"[174] Final Judg ment 235 claimed Ruby supplied arms for Castro through Prio, that he had seen Ruby around a private airport, and had known Ruby to run guns by boat. There are others who confirm that Ruby was in the gunrunn ing business in Florida during the late 1950's. One was Eladio del Valle, a former Cuban congressman and a good friend of Mario Kohly . . .” 471 The aforementioned Kohly was one of the primary leaders of the Cuban exiles who turned against Castro after t he Cuban dictator turned the tables on his previous allies in the Lansky Crime Syndicate which helped bring Castro to power (as we documented in Chapter 7). Kohly himself subsequently turned to Meyer Lansky for support and offered to return his casino righ ts if he, Kohly, were able to assume power in Cuba after Castro was removed. 47 2 Thus it was that Jack Ruby was an important errand boy in the strange pro - and anti - Castro dealings of both the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. Nonetheles s, there is clearly more to the story of Jack Ruby that needs to be explored. RUBY, OSWALD AND THE CIA The late John Henshaw, a crack investigative reporter operating out of Washington, D.C., did some of his own digging into Ruby's background. Henshaw, w ho worked as an investigator for syndicated columnist Drew Pearson (about whom we shall see more in Chapter 17) uncovered a link between Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald, tying them together with the CIA. According to Henshaw, Dallas police officials were actual ly in the process of investigating Ruby and Oswald in the assassination attempt on retired General Edwin Walker several months before the JFK murder. A bullet was fired through Walker's window, although the general, a dedicated anti - communist and Castro cr itic, was unharmed. However, there is some debate among assassination researchers as to what role Oswald did play — if any — in the shooting at the Walker residence. This is yet another of the many unanswered questions surrounding the JFK mystery. At any rate, according to Henshaw's account, a secret police investigation of the shooting linked Oswald and Ruby to the incident. Then, according to Henshaw, a high - ranking FBI official was asked by a top official in the Justice Department to intervene and stop the i mpending arrest of the two Dallas operatives. Henshaw said that it was the CIA itself that had asked the FBI to intervene. According to Henshaw, the CIA was using Ruby to recruit Dallas men into the anti - Castro movement. However, the FBI official refused t o intervene, saying it would be obstructing justice. The FBI official did say, though, that he would make the request only if he were formally directed to do so in a written communication signed by the Justice Department official. Shortly thereafter, accor ding to Henshaw's account, the FBI official then received a signed directive. He contacted Dallas police and urged them not to arrest Oswald and Ruby. But the Dallas police also wanted an official signed communication. Thereupon the Justice Department sent the communication to Dallas Police Chief Curry asking that Oswald and Ruby be left strictly alone. Justice"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"236 The Errand Boy [175] explained it didn't want Oswald and Ruby arrested because of \"reasons of state\" and that the department was making the request on the CIA's behalf . 473 Henshaw's account is yet another of the significant reports which point in the direction of undisclosed covert activities by both Ruby and Oswald together, being carried out under the direction of the CIA. Henshaw also wrote that Texas Attorney Genera l Waggoner Carr was being kept under surveillance by the FBI because he had undisclosed evidence: \"The evidence includes a copy of the missing film taken moments before Jack Ruby shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. The film covers Ruby's progress through th e FBI and police screens guarding the entrance of the Dallas Police headquarters. Two cameramen had been assigned by a Dallas TV station to cover the entrance, but were ordered by federal agents to knock off film footage which showed a high official of the Justice Department escorting [Ruby] through the two security screens.\" 474 According to Henshaw, high - level federal pressure stopped Carr's investigation after it was learned that he had an uncut copy of the entire film. He allegedly kept a copy for himsel f. There is evidence of other possible contact between Ruby and Oswald — even in New Orleans. This evidence has never been published to this author's knowledge. This author received access to a private letter written on February 20, 1967 during the controver sy over New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's inquiry into the assassination. The author of the letter described the fears of his aunt, a New Orleans woman, who was a neighbor of Lee Harvey Oswald's during his sojourn in the Crescent City. \"She is t errified to the point that she will not cooperate,\" he said. \"She stated that her fear was based upon the possibility that 'Garrison would get me for withholding evidence' and the possibility that 'someone will put a bullet in my back.' \"She made the follo wing points to me: (1) She observed Oswald having visitors three times (a) two \"Cuban looking\" men visited him twice and (b) a man and woman came and picked up Oswald one weekend. 'This man had the same profile as pictures of Ruby,' she said. 'Every time I see a picture of Ruby, this visitor of Oswald pops into my mind, but I am afraid to say anything about it. I could not swear that it was Ruby, but I couldn't swear that it wasn't.'\" 475 Ruby apparently did visit New Orleans during the time Oswald was there , ostensibly trying to find a stripper for his club. Could it be the woman seen with the Ruby - look - alike was one of these strippers? That Jack Ruby did indeed have ties to both the Lansky Syndicate and to the CIA involving Cuba is, today, not in doubt. How ever, during the period of the Warren Commission investigation, the official government \"investigation\" preferred to look the other way. According to Ruby biographer, Seth Kantor: \"After the Ruby trial ended, Leon Hubert and Burt Griffin, the Warren Commis sion's two Ruby experts, tried to convince Commission members in memorandums on March 19 and April 1, 1964, that there was \"substantial evidence\" showing Jack Ruby had maintained unexplained"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"[176] Final Judgment 237 Cuban associations. But the efforts of Hubert and Griffin were blocked by the CIA and discouraged by others on the Commission staff.\" 476 Kantor suggests that \"Ruby and Oswald probably didn't know each other; yet both could have been used as separate parts of a conspiracy to commit murder in Dallas on the weekend of N ovember 22 - 24, 1963. Oswald on Friday. Ruby on Sunday. Two men separately manipulated by the same power. After they were arrested and jailed, both men said they had been manipulated. 'I'm a patsy,' said Oswald. 'I've been used for a purpose,' said Ruby. 47 7 Despite Kantor's observations to the contrary, we have seen evidence (in Chapter 11, for example) that Ruby did almost assuredly know Lee Harvey Oswald and that Ruby did indeed participate in matters relating to the assassination. Whether Ruby — and Oswald — did, in fact, know that the assassination of Kennedy was in planning is another story. A CONSPIRACY AGAINST CONNALLY? Michael Milan, who has written of his role in working as part of a secret U.S. government team collaborating with the Lansky Syndicate says there were at least several people operating in Dallas who believed that they were not involved in a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy, but, instead, in a conspiracy to kill Texas Governor John B. Connally. According to Milan, he (Milan) played a par t in the JFK assassination cover - up. Milan claims that following the assassination he was dispatched to Dallas by J. Edgar Hoover himself. Milan's assignment was to kill a cab driver named Brinkman. Milan met with Brinkman and began questioning him. When Milan asked who set up the shooting, Brinkman said, \"I never met the guy before I was introduced to him by this broad at [Jack Ruby's] Carousel Club. And I didn't shoot nobody. There was me and two other guys. We weren't even after the president. We were s upposed to shoot the governor, but things happened too fast. They were gone before anybody did anything. I think there were two other guys doin' what I was supposed to do. But I don't know who they are or where they was when the shooting started. We was ju st supposed to shoot at the governor when they passed and get out of there. That's all. But nuthin' happened. I mean, everything happened and I just got outta there fast.\" 478 Milan completed his assignment and killed Brinkman. When he returned to Washingt on he was met at the airport, he says, by Hoover who said, \"You already know too much. So I'll just say: Johnson. No doubt. We stand away. Do you get it?\" 479 Is it conceivable, perhaps, that Jack Ruby was not consciously involved in a plot that he believe d was aimed at John F. Kennedy, but at John B. Connally instead? Can the same thing be said for Oswald? Is it possible that the two men were being manipulated as part of an even bigger conspiracy that they knew nothing about? This is all speculation, but i t is something to consider."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"238 The Errand Boy [177] The Lansky connection to Ruby's role in the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up goes much deeper than we have explored thus far. LA NSK Y' S CO UR I ER I N DA L L AS One day prior to the JFK assassination one of Meyer Lansky's l ongtime personal couriers, one Jim Braden, was visiting in Dallas. He was also on the scene in Dealey Plaza when JFK was assassinated, actually being taken into custody by the Dallas police, and then released. Standard accounts of the role of organized cri me in the JFK assassination conspiracy have frequently pointed out Braden's strange doings in Dallas. What has been ignored, however, is his close relationship to Meyer Lansky. David Scheim, writing in Contract on America, provides his readers a lengthy di scussion of Braden, but never once mentions his connection with Lansky. Scheim prefers to leave the reader with the impression that Braden was a \"Mafia\" courier — not a Lansky courier. 480 Even G. Robert Blakey and Richard Billings (Scheim's chief source) ac knowledge in their own book that Braden was, reportedly, a \"personal courier\" for Lansky. \"In the end,\" say Blakey and Billings, \"we reached no firm judgment on Braden's mob connections or on whether his activities in Dallas were in any way related to the assassination.\" 481 What Blakey does not mention, however, is that Braden was so much a key figure in the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate that he was a charter member of the Lansky Syndicate - financed La Costa Country Club. In Chapter 10, as we have seen, it was Blakey who was on the payroll of Lansky associate, Morris Dalitzone of the founders of La Costa, after Dalitz and his partners sued Penthouse magazine for publicizing the mob links of the Carlsbad, California resort. Blakey, in fact, served, in effe ct, as a character reference for the Lansky Syndicate defending the resort against the accusations — something Blakey, for obvious reasons, would not be inclined to brag about when proclaiming himself a crime - buster. BRADEN, RUBY & FERRIE The late Bernard Fensterwald supplies us some of the interesting details about the activities of Lansky's courier: \"Braden also had some other startling connections which were also never discovered by the Warren Commission. Jim Braden had visited the same Dallas office of the H. L. Hunt Oil Company that Jack Ruby visited on November 21, 1963 — the afternoon before the assassination — and at approximately the same time. \"Braden was also staying at the Cabana Motel in Dallas — a reported \"mob hang - out\" that was frequented by Jack R uby and various Ruby associates. Ruby visited the Cabana Motel sometime around midnight on the night before the assassination — November 21, 1963 — while Jim Braden was a guest there. Braden also has a possible connection to the late David Ferrie. According to information documented by Peter Noyes, Braden worked out of an office suite — Room 1701 — in the Pere Marquette Building in New"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"[178] Final Judgment 239 Orleans in the fall of 1963, in the weeks immediately preceding the assassination. During this same period in late 1963, David Fe rrie was working for Mafia leader Carlos Marcello on the same floor . . . in the same building . . . just down the hall from Braden — in Room 1707. 482 [Fensterwald notes further that Noyes has found additional evidence that Braden once listed his address as Room 1706 — right next to Ferrie! In Chapter 11 we examined the role of CIA contract agent David Ferrie and his connection to the JFK assassination conspiracy in some detail. The evidence cited by Fensterwald only draws the circle more closely.) That one of Meyer Lansky's chief couriers would be in Dallas and moving in Ruby's sphere of operations is evidence that the fine hand of Meyer Lansky himself was in motion in Dallas and, more than likely, this is a direct link between Lansky and Ruby. According to La nsky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen (Ruby's role model) couriers such as Braden were very important in the Lansky Syndicate: \"Important messages never came by phone. Anything to do with a hit, a gambling operation, to go somewhere or to see somebody, was by courier. See, we worried about wiretaps thirty years ago. Even money was only transacted person to person. If anybody had money coming or going, you put a man on a plane.\" 483 Another Lansky associate, Michael Milan, has also written of the importan ce of mob couriers and the need for secrecy. \"Whenever he came to a sitdown, Mr. Lansky always had his percentage figured out in advance. He kept it all in his head, too.\" 484 There is evidence, however, that Ruby and Braden did indeed have a very close co nnection. Lansky's courier Jim Braden was also a \"friend\" 485 of Lansky's Mexico City representative, \"Happy\" Meltzer,\" whom we met earlier in this chapter as the head of a drug - smuggling operation in which Ruby was evidently involved. Obviously, Lansky's c ourier, Jim Braden, may have indeed been bringing a message from Lansky to Ruby. But whatever his role in Dallas, there's no question but that he was there for a purpose. This was not a case of coincidence, but indeed, conspiracy. All of this, taken togeth er, suggests, as we have said, that the Lansky - Ruby connection is much deeper than might be perceived and far more than some \"crime solvers\" would have us realize. What is especially interesting, further, is an additional Lansky connection to Ruby that sur faced after the assassination of JFK and after the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. MELVIN BELLI COMES TO TOWN In Chapter 13 we examined the strange — and little known role — of Meyer Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, in the JFK assassination conspirac y. Cohen — himself a longtime Ruby associate and the Dallas mobster's role model — was obviously a key figure in the network of conspiracy. It was Cohen's longtime friend — and attorney — Melvin Belli who stepped forward as Jack Ruby's defense attorney."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"240 The Errand Boy [179] Belli an d Cohen had known each other for years. In fact, Belli was a regular at the Los Angeles nightspot, Rondelli's, of which Cohen was the secret owner. And, as we've noted, he was also Cohen's lawyer. The two were so close that Belli even once had Cohen introd uced as \"Professor O'Brien from Harvard who's going to give you a talk on tax laws,\" 486 to a meeting of the American Bar Association in Miami. According to Cohen, writing in his memoirs, the Los Angeles mobster assumed the platform and then began rattlin g on for some time, essentially saying nothing. He then concluded, \"My advice to all of ya is to be sure to pay your goddamn taxes right to the letter.\" 487 Blakey and Billings, in The Plot to Kill the President , addressed the circumstances in which the Lan sky henchman's attorney came to represent Jack Ruby: \"How Melvin Belli, a nationally known trial lawyer, was brought in to handle the Ruby defense was a matter of some dispute. We heard a report that Seymour Ellison, a lawyer associated with Belli, got a p hone call from `a Las Vegas attorney' who said, 'Sy, one of our guys just bumped off the son of a bitch that gunned down the President. We can't move in to handle it, but there's a million bucks for Mel if he'll take it.' \"Ellison confirmed to us that he r eceived the phone call, but he said he did not remember the name of the Las Vegas attorney and nothing developed from the call. Belli told us a different story. He said Earl Ruby came to California three days after his brother was arrested; he watched Bell i sum up a murder defense in a Los Angeles courtroom and he asked him to take the case. \"Belli said he declined at first. He had learned that his fee would be paid by the sale of Ruby's story to newspapers, and he did not care to be involved in that sort o f exploitation. Nevertheless, Earl Ruby talked him into it, Belli told us, and he took the case with five goals in mind: to save Jack Ruby; to strengthen the law; to show that current legal tests for insanity were inadequate; to wed modern law to modern sc ience; and to help Dallas 'solve its problem.'\" 488 Interestingly, Blakey and Billings report further that Ruby's brother Earl had told yet another version of the \"official\" story. They also make passing reference to the Ruby - Cohen relationship. Noting tha t \"Ruby liked to tell friends that he knew Mickey Cohen,\" they concluded: \"We could not be certain just how well Ruby knew Cohen, who also grew up in Chicago, but he admired him and tried to emulate him.\" 489 As far as Belli's decision to defend Ruby, Blak ey and Billings said: \"We found it difficult to believe that Belli did not receive a substantial fee for his defense of Ruby.\" 49 0 The two also noted that “We considered the possibility that Belli went to Mexico to pick up a fee for the Ruby defense, but w e found no proof that he did.\" 491 Whatever the case, Belli's defense of Ruby failed. Ruby was convicted and sentenced to death. Ruby's family formally fired Belli as Ruby's attorney. But Ruby's death was announced just shortly before he was"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"[180] Final Judgment 241 scheduled to be retried for his murder of the alleged assassin. As a consequence, any final determination of just what role Ruby played in the JFK assassination scenario became another mystery in an endless series of mysteries. Jack Ruby could never tell what he knew. This was not the end of Melvin Belli's role in the JFK controversy, however. As pioneer JFK assassination investigator Mark Lane noted in his second book on the assassination, A Citizen's Dissent, Belli emerged as one of the leading defenders of the offic ial Warren Commission version of the assassination. According to Lane, ABC - TV's Les Crane show wanted to stage a debate between Lane and Belli. \"I was less sanguine, for, although I was confident in my knowledge of the facts, Belli's almost legendary orato rical accomplishments had preceded him to the East coast.\" 492 Lane points out that he subsequently received a call from the producer telling him that the debate was canceled. According to the producer: \"It's the ABC brass. They have just said no. Period. T hey say you have the facts and the affidavits and that would just confuse the audience.\" 493 But the show itself was not, in fact, canceled — only the debate between the well - informed Lane and Belli. \"It's just that we can't have you on.\" Lane was told. There 's going to be a debate anyway. We're getting Oswald's mother.\" 494 Lane summarized the situation in this way: \"And so it came to pass that the first network broadcast presenting both sides of the controversy found splendiferous Melvin Belli, conqueror of a thousand juries, opposed by a poorly educated widow. Mrs. Oswald's visceral responses were meritorious, but her lack of command over the facts, together with Belli's bully tactics, reduced the program to the low level of entertainment that the network app arently sought.\" 4 95 After some negotiations, Belli finally agreed to debate on stage under one condition -- that both wear tuxedoes. There would be three debates. It was during the first debate, in San Francisco, that Belli came on stage, wearing a cape ove r his tuxedo, and in his concluding remarks made his final judgment on the JFK assassination conspiracy. He declared \"If we cannot trust the FBI, the CIA and Earl Warren, then God pity us. \" 496 However, the Establishment media did not see fit to publicize the circumstances of this debate, despite the fact, as Lane points out, that Belli himself is somewhat of a celebrity. As Lane noted: \"In San Francisco, if Belli's office is burglarized or if he agrees to represent a topless dancer, he is on the front page of the newspapers and may be seen repeatedly on television screens. Perhaps those assembled that evening constituted the largest paying audience to witness a debate in many years in San Francisco.

However, according to Lane, \"Not one daily newspaper in New York, and possibly in the nation, even mentioned th at the event had occurred.\" 498 This despite the fact that there were half a dozen papers in New York at the time. Lane commented: \"The New York Times refers to itself as a newspaper of record. That which is not found within its many pages ostensibly did n ot happen. For this reason the Belli encounter in New York is known to some as the debate that never occurred.\" 499 That a prominent attorney who represented Mickey Cohen, a key figure in Meyer Lansky's international crime operations (and also an important cog in Israel's global machinations), later came to represent Jack Ruby is clearly significant. A WELL - PLACED ERRAND BOY Although Jack Ruby's actual role in the planning stages of the JFK assassination conspiracy will probably never be fully known, ther e is no question that, in the end, Ruby became a critical factor in the cover - up. His murder of Lee Harvey Oswald silenced the one man who could no doubt fill in at least some of the missing pieces of the puzzle. Jack Ruby was a well - placed errand boy, not only for Meyer Lansky and his global crime syndicate, but also, it appears, for the covert arm of the CIA as well. Ruby did his job and he did it well. Although Ruby sought to speak freely, the Warren Commission refused his entreaties to be allowed to com e to Washington to tell his story. The story of how Chief Justice Earl Warren refused to give Ruby the opportunity to leave Dallas and tell his story is a famous part of JFK assassination folklore. As a consequence, Ruby never did have the chance to give h is version of what really happened. Jack Ruby was indeed \"the smoking gun, the Rosetta stone, the trout in the milk.\" He also may have even been — as even Lee Harvey Oswald proclaimed himself — a \"patsy.\" Just one player — albeit, in the end, an important one — Ru by played a starring role in a drama orchestrated far beyond his seamy Carousel Club in Dallas. Ruby was an errand boy in a high - stakes operation — the assassination of an American president — that was being undertaken by the joint alliance of the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate, the CIA and Israel's Mossad. A STRANGE STORY As this book was being completed, a very strange story about Jack Ruby came to this author's attention that bears repeating, if only for the reason that it should be part of the permanent rec ord, particularly considering our contention that Israel did indeed have a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"[182] Final Judgment 243 Before relating the story itself, a few words should be mentioned about the credibility of the source. The original source was a now deceased Idaho woman named Grace Pratt who related the story to a friend (now living in Oregon) whose name must remain anonymous. This author has spoken with the Oregon man, an elderly retiree, and has concluded that he believes very strongly in the reliab ility of Mrs. Pratt. He has provided this author with a written summary of what Mrs. Pratt told him about her connection with Jack Ruby. The memorandum reads — in pertinent part — as follows: \"In Idaho in the 1960's I met George and Grace Pratt, who had moved to Nampa from California upon retirement. The Pratts became very good friends of mine. George had worked in the Navy yard and Grace had cooked for many years in many of the big restaurants in San Francisco. \"For a longtime she had worked for 'Tiny's.' Tiny 's had a side - by - side restaurant and bar with a door between, opening into the anteroom between the dining room and the kitchen. The bar was run by Jack Ruby. He also had charge of the ladies in the basement. The bar was a place for the `underworld' to mee t. After the dinner rush was over, Grace would fix her plate and one for Jack Ruby, and they would eat in the anteroom. \"One day she heard a shuffle and looked up just in time to hear the zip of a gun with a silencer. A man had rushed through the door and fallen dead on the floor. A big husky man came back, gripped her by the arm until she thought he would crush it and said, 'You didn't see anything, did you. You didn't hear anything, did you?' She answered, 'No, I was in the back of the kitchen. I did not see anything. I did not hear anything.' From then on she had their confidence. Jack shared a lot of the things that went on in the bar with her. Anyone who knew Jack Ruby that well would always be able to recognize him going or coming. BOUND FOR ISRAEL? \"Six days after Jack Ruby's funeral was publicized in the press, Grace called me very excited and said, \"I was just now watching the news. They turned the TV camera on a ramp up to a plane loading for Israel from New York, and who do you think went up the ramp? I screamed to George in the other room, calling him and saying, 'Come quickly! Jack Ruby is boarding that plane!' \"At the top of the ramp he stopped, turned around, and looking straight into the camera he tipped his hat and entered the plane. She sai d she thought he was giving the message to someone that he had made it and was on his way. The Pratts were shocked. She said there had already been a number of JFK assassination witnesses who had mysteriously died. Two years after seeing him board for Isra el, she heard through the underground that Ruby had gone to Brazil. \"She made me promise not to tell anyone what she told me until after her death. Grace has been gone about ten years now. Knowing Grace and her"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"244 The Errand Boy [183] credibility, I believe every word. If someo ne had the clout to check the grave to have the 'body' exhumed, this might be very revealing.\" 500 So ends the strange memorandum received by this author. The words speak for themselves. The source who provided the author with this unusual memorandum firmly believes that Mrs. Pratt did indeed know Jack Ruby well and that Mrs. Pratt herself was convinced that she had seen Ruby boarding the plane for Israel. Another individual who knew Mrs. Pratt told this author that she was a highly credible individual not g iven to tale - spinning and that she had indeed mentioned her acquaintance with Ruby (although she had not told him the story about having seen Ruby departing for Israel). Is this story the product of one woman's imagination? Or did Mrs. Pratt indeed see jus t what she believed she saw? Is possible that Mrs. Pratt has provided us yet another key tying Israel to the most intimate levels of the JFK assassination conspiracy? It is worth remembering that even as these words are written, many leaders in Israel and leaders of the Israeli lobby in the United States are working tirelessly for the pardon of American - born Israeli spy, Jonathan Jay Pollard, sentenced to life in prison for passing U.S. defense secrets to Israel. Is it possible, perhaps, that a similar, sec ret arrangement was made on Jack Ruby's behalf? Is it possible that, on \"humanitarian\" grounds, Ruby was quietly released from prison and permitted to go to Israel? (After all, it could be argued, it was Ruby who had become a hero by killing \"the man who k illed President Kennedy.\") Is it possible that the decision was made to usher Ruby quietly out of the country so that there would be no widely publicized trial in which Ruby's connections — would be bared? SOMEBODY WAS HELPING RUBY It is interesting to not e that on October 6, 1966, at the time Ruby was granted a new trial, the Washington Daily News carried a story proclaiming that \"It's Possible for Ruby to Go Free,\" as a result of a second trial. The story quoted his lawyer as saying the case was so simple that \"Somebody just out of law school can handle it.\" 5 0 1 What's more, it's interesting to note a little - noticed column by veteran crime reporter Dorothy Kilgallen who had an abiding (and perhaps fatal) interest in the JFK case. In her column datelined DA LLAS, February 21, reporting on the Ruby trial, Miss Kilgallen reported that \"one of the best kept secrets of the Jack Ruby trial is the extent to which the federal government is cooperating with the defense. The unprecedented alliance between Ruby's lawye rs and the Department of Justice in Washington may provide the case with the one dramatic element it has lacked: MYSTERY.\" 5 02 Miss Kilgallen revealed that a deal between Ruby's lawyers and the FBI, \"provides Ruby's side with reams of helpful information t hat they would never have been able to get without the G - Men — on the condition they do not ask for anything at all about Ruby's alleged victim, Lee Harvey"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"[184] Final Judgment 245 Oswald. It appears that Washington knows or suspects something about Oswald that it does not want Da llas and the rest of the world to know or suspect. Why is Oswald being kept in the shadows, as dim a figure as they can make him, while the defense tries to rescue his killer with the help of information from the FBI? Who was Oswald, anyway?\" 503 Perhaps M iss Kilgallen found out the answer to the questions. She reportedly told several friends, shortly before her \"accidental\" death from a combined drug overdose and alcohol, that she was about to crack the Kennedy case wide open. That Ruby's path to possible freedom was being assisted by the FBI (during his first trial) does raise questions. Then, coupled with his reported \"death\" prior to a second trial — especially considering the story told by the late Grace Pratt — the mystery deepens. Did Jack Ruby really die in prison or did he secretly emigrate to the J e wis h ho meland o f I sr ael?

P er h a p s s o me enterprising researcher may ans wer the question: \"What did happen to the `corpse' of Jack Ruby?\" A NOTE FOR THE RECORD: Following the release of the first edition of Final Judgment, the author came across an obscure volume entitled The Ruby - Oswald Affair, published in 1988. The author w as the late Alan Adelson who had served as the attorney for Jack Ruby's family in the probate of Ruby's will. Adelson died just shortly before his book was published. At the beginning of the book Adelson describes how he attended Ruby's funeral in the comp any of Ruby's brother, Earl: \"The funeral had been a closed - casket affair. I realized immediately that the closed casket would raise questions. Who was to know if Jack was really in the casket? I had heard rumors that Kennedy was not really dead, but was h idden away in South America. 'Earl,' I said, let them see. I know it sounds grisly, but let's put it to rest.' The lid of the casket was opened, and for the first time I saw Jack, the man I would learn to know almost as well as I knew myself.\" 5 04 To the b est of my knowledge, this is the only known reference to anyone actually having seen Jack Ruby in the casket. In this case, the reference came from someone who had not actually known Jack Ruby in person. Although photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald (both duri ng his autopsy and in his coffin) as well as photographs of John F. Kennedy (during his autopsy) have been widely circulated, there are no known such photographs of Ruby. Frankly, I do not find Adelson's posthumously - published proclamation of having seen \" Jack\" (a man he never saw alive) as any refutation of the story by Grace Pratt. For the record, however, it seems appropriate to record the comments attributed to Adelson. A FINAL MYSTERY — RUBY AND THE ADL On June 27, 1964, Stanley Kaufman, Ruby's lawyer and longtime friend, testified before the Warren Commission and noted the following:"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"[ 246 The Errand Boy [185] \"About the Anti - Defamation League, although I do say I talked to the FBI agents about it, but not in connection with a conversation with Jack.\" Kaufman continued in a me andering way and then concluded: \"I do want the record to be correct, because I don't think that Jack Ruby and I ever discussed the Anti - Defamation League ....\" Obviously, Kaufman very much wanted to keep the ADL — an arm of Israel's Mossad — from being associ ated with Jack Ruby. So then, just what was Ruby's association with the ADL? Was he perhaps an ADL informant? Was he an ADL conduit to the Dallas Police Department? What influence did the ADL have on Ruby, if any? The answers to these questions would be re vealing. NEW REVELATIONS . . . As readers may recall from the opening pages of Final Judgment, the author received an unusual manuscript from Dallas in the opening days of 2005. That document filled in a vast array of details about intrigues surrounding the pro - Israel Dallas Jewish elite (and of Texas in general) and laid to rest the myth put forth by many naïve \"JFK researchers\" who claim Dallas was ruled by anti - Jewish right - wing John Birchers. The document's revelations, taken together with what had al ready been outlined in this chapter on Jack Ruby, should give serious researchers more leads to follow. Ironically, although I had known for years that Dallas Jewish leader Sam Bloom was in charge of planning JFK' s Dallas trip, I disregarded the point sin ce — contrary to what my critics say — I was NOT \"looking for Jews under every rock.\" Now, thanks to the Dallas manuscript, I have to confess that my efforts to \"be moderate\" and not focusing on someone who happened to be Jewish caused me to miss or ignore dis tinct Israeli connections in Dallas to the JFK conspiracy. Despite all this, evil critics who charged that my book and my motivations were \"anti - Semitic to the core\" have been proven wrong, very wrong, and as far as I am concerned this alone clears me of t he charge. Because I was not writing from an \"anti - Semitic\" viewpoint, as the liars charged, I missed some very serious points that, thankfully, have now been covered in this book. AND ONE LAST ITEM: Although the Grace Pratt story of Jack Ruby's phony \"dea th\" is controversial, I recently received an item from the Feb. 6, 1978 edition of The Village Voice, written by Alexander Cockburn and James Ridgeway. The item lends credence to Mrs. Pratt's story. In an article focusing on new revelations surrounding Lee Oswald's CIA ties, Cockburn and Ridgeway wrote: \"Though already dismissed as a baseless rumor, the allegation that Jack Ruby is still alive and was given a new identity by the Central Intelligence Agency was not dreamed up by the veteran conspiracy buffs but was, in fact, advanced by a former employee of the agency itself. \"The Ruby story — to the effect that the CIA, in cooperation with the KGB, sponsored Ruby's murder of Oswald before the latter could disclose damning details of U.S. - Soviet intelligence li nks — has been put forward privately in recent weeks by Frank Snepp, formerly of the CIA. Snepp recently published Decent Interval, a harsh denunciation of the CIA's conduct in the last days of the Vietnam War.\" THE TWAIN SHALL MEET So it is. We have exami ned the players. We have examined their motives. We have examined the interplay between the relatively small group of individuals whom we have linked to the JFK assassination conspiracy. Let us move forward and determine a critical point of contact that ti es together the diverse — yet closely connected — elements behind the conspiracy that took the life of John F. Kennedy.

A n d a s w e shall see, the French connection is, actually, the Israeli connect ion. In Oliver Stone's film, JFK, actor Kevin Costner (portraying Jim Garrison) confronts actor Tommy Lee Jones (portraying Clay Shaw) and displays Italian newspaper articles exposing the activities of a Rome - based operation known as Permindex. Shaw, an i nternational trade executive, served on the board of Permindex. The film audience is left with the impression that Permindex was a covert CIA operation, the purpose of which — at least in the film — is never defined. However, as the evidence now shows, Permind ex was a Mossad arms trading and money laundering venture operating in conjunction with the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. And Clay Shaw, a longtime CIA asset, serving on the Permindex board, was a prime player in the New Orleans phase of the JFK assass ination conspiracy. Therein, quite simply, lies the key to the mystery behind the JFK assassination. Therein lies the explanation as to why Jim Garrison's investigation of Clay Shaw, a director of Permindex, had to be scuttled. Not only had Garrison stumbl ed upon a definitive CIA link, but he had also (inadvertently) discovered the Israeli connection. But at the time Garrison"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"248 The Twain Shall Meet [187] himself never even suspected how deeply the Permindex nexus went. Garrison had only come across the tip of the iceberg. THE SECRET ABOUT PERM INDEX Israel's Mossad was the key force behind Permindex. In fact, one of the chief shareholders in the Permindex holding company was the Banque De Credit International of Geneva, 505 established by Tibor Rosenbaum, the longtime Director for Fin ance and Supply of Israel's Mossad. It was BCI, as we saw in Chapter 7 and Chapter 12, which served as Meyer Lansky 's chief money laundering bank in Europe. According to Meyer Lansky's sympathetic Israeli biographers: \"After Israel became a state, almost 90 percent of its purchases of arms abroad was channeled through Rosenbaum's bank. The financing of many of Israel's most daring secret operations was carried out through the funds in [BCI].\" 506 BCI also served as a depository for the Permindex account. T h a t T i b o r R o s e n b a u m ' s B C I w a s a c o n t r o l l i n g f o r c e behind the enig matic P ermindex entity places Israel and its M o s sa d i n t he v er y ce n t er o f t h e c o n s p ir a cy b e h i n d t he assassination of John F. Kennedy. Clay Shaw's positioning in New Orleans, site of one operat ional rung of the conspiracy, resulted in Shaw's implication in the investigation conducted by Jim Garrison. But the conspiracy went much deeper. Ultimately, as we now know, Garrison came to recognize that Israel's Mossad was intimately involved in the eve nts in Dallas on November 22, 1963. However, in the beginning, Garrison surely never even suspected it and certainly had no reason to do so. JFK's secret war with Israel was an unknown factor in the geo - political events of the period. Attention instead was focused on American involvement in Southeast Asia 'TRANSNATIONAL CONNECTIONS' In examining the JFK assassination conspiracy, according to researcher Peter Dale Scott, \"a first step is to suggest that one ingredient in the complex, multi - centered intrigu es that climaxed in the Kennedy assassination was the participation of diverse unaccountable transnational connections, each transcending the limits of American political society, and each with distinctive motives for the murder of the president . . . \"To now recognize a transnational dimension to the case is . . . to recognize that the American political system is of necessity an open one, and thus increasingly susceptible to the growing influence of money and intelligence penetration from abroad [our emp hasis] . . . \"Transnational connections are common modes of interaction between intelligence agencies, often in intrigues of which heads of government may be, at best, only dimly aware. Sometimes they may give rise to more overt, structured arrangements or forums such as the World Anti - Communist"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"[188] Final Judgment 249 League, a forum, financed over the years by countries like Nationalist China and Saudi Arabia, with recurring links to the international drug traffic.\" 507 Scott notes additionally that \"It is well known that in th e 1950s and 1960s the Israel Lobby and the Taiwan Lobby were both powerful in Washington and sometimes collaborated on common projects . . . There was also a Nicaragua Lobby, or perhaps more accurately, a Somoza Lobby, which also overlapped with the Israel , China, and Cuba lobbies.\" 508 (Scott points out, for example, that a Washington lobbyist who was close to New Orleans Mafia chief Carlos Marcello also served as a registered lobbyist for both Nicaragua and the Israeli Aircraft Industries.) It is clear, ba sed upon the evidence that we shall review in these pages, that Permindex, which played so central a role in the JFK assassination conspiracy, was indeed one of these transnational \"overt, structured arrangements or forums\" of which Scott speaks. WHAT WAS PERMINDEX? What exactly then was Permindex? How did Permindex fit into the center of the international conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Author Paris Flammonde's 1969 account of the Garrison investigation, The Kennedy Cons piracy, contains valuable information on Permindex, although, unfortunately, Flammonde didn't pursue the matter as far as he could have. Had he done so he would have unearthed the Israeli - Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate connection. Flammonde cites several articles that appeared in the foreign press, specifically Italy's Paesa Sera (March 4, 1967) and the Canadian publication, Le Devoir (March 16, 1967) as his source for much of the information he provides his readers on Permindex. These articles appeared j ust shortly after Clay Shaw's name first came to attention as a result of the Garrison investigation and were the articles highlighted in Oliver Stone's JFK. These articles provide the unusual background of Permindex and point toward its real origins. \"The re was established in Rome an organization named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale,\" reported Paesa Sera. [Centro Mondiale Commerciale is Italian for \"World Trade Center.\"] \"Its origins, functions, rotating presidency, geographical displacements, sub - , subse quent, and alternate designations were so complex and labyrinthine as to make a comprehensive and comprehensible description of it in anything less than a modern - sized book impossible.\" 509 The CMC was founded in 1961 by one Giorgio Mantello. 51 0 The Italia n name, however, was an affectation. Mantello was an Eastern European Jew originally named Georges Mandel. At the time CMC was established, it was asserted that CMC would function as an international commercial organization, that it would aid in the establ ishing of a permanent worldwide network of trade expositions, and generally assist concerns involved in trade matters."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"250 The Twain Shall Meet [189] Permindex was a subsidiary of CMC. The name Permindex is an acronym which stood for PERmanent INDustrial EXpositions. 511 Clay Shaw, of course, was the founder and director of the International Trade Mart in the key port city of New Orleans. Thus, Shaw's connection with an international trade entity seems logical. However, there was more to the story, as the foreign press revealed: \"Actual ly it was soon to become evident that the seemingly vast, mighty structure was not a rock of solidarity, but a shell of superficiality; not constructed with mass, supporting promise, but composed of channels through which money flowed back and forth, with no one knowing the source or the destination of these liquid assets.\" reports Paris Flammonde. 512 CLAY SHAW'S LITTLE - KNOWN SPONSORS What about Clay Shaw? How did this New Orleans socialite come to become involved in the strange world of the international entity known as Permindex? Who were Clay Shaw's sponsors? What no JFK assassination researchers — even those who cite Clay Shaw's now widely - known CIA connections — ever seem to have noted is yet another Shaw connection that places him further into the net of the CIA - Mossad - Lansky Crime Syndicate nexus. We refer to Shaw's tie to Seymour Weiss who ran New Orleans, alongside Carlos Marcello, for the Lansky syndicate and was Lansky's contact man with Louisiana's famed \"Kingfish,\" Huey P. Long. 513 In Chapter 10, a s we have seen, it was Lansky who installed Carlos Marcello as the Mafia boss of New Orleans. It was Weiss, however, who emerged as the Lansky syndicate bagman and political operative working in conjunction with Marcello. In fact, Lansky's man Weiss was pu rportedly the prime target of the IRS investigation of Long — referenced in Chapter 10 — that was initiated the day before Long's assassination, and, according to Peter Dale Scott, \"Long's murder in 1935, some say, was arranged to prevent men like Weiss from g oing to jail.\" 514 Scott has noted additionally that House Assassinations Committee director G. Robert Blakey has omitted \"all reference to the role of Seymour Weiss\" 515 in his account of Carlos Marcello's rise to power in New Orleans. To do so, of course , as we noted in Chapter 10, would point in the direction of Meyer Lansky. SEYMOUR WEISS AND THE CIA Now although Weiss ultimately did serve time in prison on other racketeering charges, this did not prevent Weiss from eventually serving on the board of Standard Fruit and Steamship 516 which maintained strong ties with the CIA in its activities in Latin America. 517 In this context it is"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"[190] Final Judgment 251 interesting to note there have been suggestions that Weiss was a key CIA contact in New Orleans and his record suggests he would have been perfectly positioned to be one. In fact, one New Orleans - based CIA contract agent investigated by Jim Garrison — the ubiquitous and colorful Gordon Novel — is known to have written a letter to a \"Mr. Weiss\" in which Novel discussed the dang ers of the Garrison investigation. The letter surfaced at the time that Garrison's inquiry was in full swing and Novel was seeking to avoid giving testimony. Many have opined that the Mr. Weiss in question was probably Novel's CIA superior, although others have suggested the \"Mr. Weiss\" may have been another Weiss — and not Seymour. Whatever the case, there is no question but that Seymour Weiss — a prime figure in the Lansky syndicate — was tied closely to the intelligence community and undoubtedly worked on its behalf in the context of his role with Standard Fruit. The major fruit companies, as numerous works can attest, had extensive interplay with the CIA inasmuch as their vested interests in the so - called \"Banana Republics\" of Latin America were directly affec ted by the governments therein. And needless to say, the CIA played a major role in the affairs of Latin America from almost its very inception. Where then do we find a tie - in between the erudite Clay Shaw, a respectable trade executive, and the Lansky syn dicate henchman — and CIA contact — Seymour Weiss? In fact, it is a very close connection indeed. THE MEN BEHIND SHAW You see, it was during the time that Weiss served as a director of the CIA - linked Standard Fruit that the powerful corporation was under the management of one Rudolph Hecht, a leading figure in the small and tightly knit but highly influential Jewish community of New Orleans. Hecht, in fact, had become chairman — by the time of his death in 1956 — of the executive committee of the International Tr ade Mart 518 of which Clay Shaw was managing director. It was Hecht and his associates, Ted Brent and Herbert 0. Schwartz, who were Shaw's sponsors. In short, Hecht was Shaw's superior. Shaw maintained the high public profile with the Trade Mart that won hi m his place in New Orleans society, while Hecht and his associates were the real powers behind the scenes. And among those who likewise served on the board of the International Trade Mart was another powerful figure in the Jewish community, Edgar Stern, Jr ., whose father Edgar and his mother Edith were among the most prominent financial angels for the Israeli lobby in America. As we shall see in Chapter 17 and Appendix Three, the Sterns — perhaps Shaw's closest friends — were the forces behind the WDSU media em pire that played a key role in portraying Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator\" prior to the JFK assassination, setting him up as the patsy. Thus, there is indeed much more to Clay Shaw than what we have been told. But it is Shaw's tie to Permindex that places him in a web of intrigue"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 The Twain Shall Meet [191] involving Israel's Mossad and global power politics that the critics of Final Judgment would certainly prefer that we ignore. Let us explore the Permindex connection further. As we do, the reality of what Permindex wa s — and how it was intimately tied to the JFK assassination — will become more apparent. LOUIS BLOOMFIELD — THE BRONFMAN CONNECTION Above all, the Permindex connection to Israel and its global intelligence network is best personified by the individual who serv ed as chairman of the board of Permindex: Major Louis M. Bloomfield of Montreal, Canada, a devoted and influential supporter of the Israeli cause. It was Bloomfield who held half the shares of Permindex and its parent company \"for party or parties unknown. \" 519 In fact, Permindex had its headquarters in Bloomfield's base of operations in Montreal until 1961 at which time it was relocated to Rome. 520 Beyond question, Bloomfield, as we shall see, was a major player in Israel's international network. Our first introduction to Bloomfield was in Chapter 7. There we learned how Bloomfield played a critical role in helping establish the state of Israel and its Mossad. In the years that followed, Bloomfield rose high in the ranks of the Canadian business world, repu ted to control Le Credit Suisse [bank] of Canada, Heineken's Breweries, Canscot Realty, the Grimaldi Siosa [shipping] Lines, Ltd — and, interestingly enough — the Israel Continental Company. 521 But the real key to understanding Bloomfield is his role as a foun ding partner in the Phillips, Vineberg, Bloomfield and Goodman firm which represents the Canadian - based Bronfman family interests. 522 This rather intriguing detail suggests that Bloomfield's wide - ranging financial interests were, in fact, those of the Bron fman family. Thus Bloomfield was essentially, a front man for the Bronfman empire. The Bronfman family, which built its fortune working with the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate in the illegal liquor trade, have been key backers of Israel and leaders in th e Zionist cause. Edgar Bronfman most recently served as president of the World Jewish Congress. But there is yet another intriguing Bronfman family link to the JFK assassination conspiracy. When a Russian translator was needed for Lee Harvey Oswald's Russi an wife, Marina, it was Texas oilman Jack Crichton, a former military intelligence officer who made the arrangements. According to JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott, Crichton, until 1962, \"was also a Vice - President of the Empire Trust Company, a firm whose leading shareholders, the inter - related families of Loeb, Lehman and Bronfman, are said by Stephen Birmingham to have maintained 'something like a private CIA ... around the world' to protect their other investments such as in Cuba, in Guatema la, and in General Dynamics.\" 523 So another Bronfman family intimate was in a key position in the days following the JFK assassination.

The director of the Israeli - Canadian Maritime League, Bloomfield also served as Chairman of the Histadrut Campaign in Canada. 524 The Histadrut, Israel's national labor federation, at one point owned over one - third of the gross national product of Israel and controlled the se cond largest bank in Israel, the Bank Hapoalim. This bank, as we shall see, was implicated in Permindex intrigue in Europe that comes full circle back to New Orleans and the Clay Shaw connection. In addition, it turns out, in the critical year of 1963, Blo omfield actually transferred $7.5 million into BCI's coffers. According to April 9, 1975 report in the New York Times, Bloomfield arranged for the deposit into BCI from a charitable foundation that Bloomfield had set up on behalf of a client. This was oste nsibly for the purpose of rescuing the Mossad - controlled bank after the government of Liberia defaulted on a substantial loan from BCI, supposedly putting the bank in peril. 525 So the Permindex chief and Rabbi Rosenbaum's BCI had a serious relationship ind eed — whatever the actual purpose of the $7.5 million deposit in the BCI account. In light of the critical role that the Permindex chief played in the affairs of BCI, it is worth noting that the same New York Times article explained precisely how critical BC I was to the interests of Israel. According to the Times: \"[BCI] did a lot of business with Israel. It helped channel money from rich investors around the world into Israel and performed any number of services for the country. Once when Defense Minister Sh imon Peres, when director general in the defense ministry, called Rosenbaum and told him that Israel needed $7 million within 24 hours for her national security, Rosenbaum found the money overnight. He did not ask for, but received, a commission of $500,00 0 for his services . . . \"The defense ministry maintained an account at the bank to buy arms in western Europe. Other accounts were held by the Histadrut, the Israeli labor federation, by Solel Bonhen (the Histadrut - owned supply and construction company), the Zim Navigation Co. and Israel Corporation, an investment company. \"526 What is particularly interesting is that the Times also added: \"But [BCI] was not an Israeli bank. It was a Jewish bank, showing healthy balance sheet assets . . . .\" 527 Clearly, Per mindex and BCI were part and parcel of the same interests — particularly in 1963. BLOOMFIELD AND U.S. INTELLIGENCE And, as we have already seen, the intelligence connections of Permindex chief Bloomfield were impeccable. Although a Canadian by birth, Bloom field was hired by J. Edgar Hoover to serve as a recruiting agent for the FBI's counterespionage division, Division Five. Through this position Bloomfield became a working partner of Division Five chief William"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"254 The Twain Shall Meet [193] Sullivan, a close friend of James J. Anglet on, the Mossad's CIA ally. Sullivan was Angleton's \"man inside\" the FBI. Bloomfield was also given an officer's rank in the U.S. Army during World War II and assigned to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) — just as had been the American who ultimately be came his fellow Permindex director, Clay Shaw. (A witness uncovered by Jim Garrison claimed to have seen a meeting in Winnipeg airport between Clay Shaw and CIA contract agent David Ferrie with another individual who may have been Bloomfield. 528 It is kno wn that Shaw and Ferrie journeyed in a plane flown by Ferrie to Bloomfield's home base in Montreal at some time in 1961 or 1962.) 529 Obviously, Louis Bloomfield was a key figure in the Permindex network — a vital link between Clay Shaw's operation in New Or leans and other forces operating through Permindex, most especially Israel. SHAW AND ANGLETON It is conceivable that not only did Bloomfield first come across Shaw during his service with the OSS during this same period, but also even another OSS man, Ja mes Jesus Angleton, who later went on to become Israel's ally in the CIA. Angleton himself may have had contact with Shaw at that time, although there is no firm evidence to prove it. However, there is one intriguing item which points to a possible connect ion between Shaw and Angelton during that period. When Jim Garrison first began investigating Clay Shaw, he only knew Shaw under the alias \"Clay Bertrand.\" We can suggest one possible inspiration for Shaw's pseudonym. While serving with U.S. intelligence d uring World War II, Shaw was stationed for a time in France where he certainly had contact with the French intelligence. At that time, one of the highest - ranking French intelligence officers was one Gustave Bertrand who was, in fact, a close friend (and ro le model) for another OSS officer, James J. Angleton. In later years Angleton \"singled out [Bertrand] as one of the people he learned the most from in a substantive way” 530 and who \"remained Angleton's friend until death \" 531 and who was Angleton's \"great Buddha head.\" 5 32 When Shaw later adopted his alias of \"Bertrand\" it is entirely conceivable that he was using this name as a salute to a senior intelligence operative with whom he first made contact in Europe and with whom he probably maintained contact i n the years that followed. This is speculation, of course, but there is no question, as the evidence now shows, that Angleton and Shaw were certainly moving in the same circles during World War II — and much later. And as we shall see in this chapter and in Chapter 16, the French intelligence connections to Permindex and to the JFK assassination conspiracy are very strong indeed. And inasmuch as Shaw later served, without question, as a valued international contact for the CIA, reporting back to the agency on his foreign ventures, it is certain that Shaw's reports would have ultimately"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"[194] Final Judgment 255 ended upon on the desk of James J. Angleton. Shaw, in effect, was functioning (at least indirectly) as one of Angleton's operatives. However, it is likely their initial relati onship was forged during their joint service with the OSS during World War II. Yet, there is one definitive Angleton - Shaw connection that has been documented and it is interesting indeed. When Shaw was later arrested by Jim Garrison, it was discovered his address book contained the private telephone number of the Principessa Marcelle Borghese. 533 The principessa was a relative of Prince Valerio Borghese who was rescued during World War II by Angleton whose exploits with the OSS in Italy as its station chie f in Rome won him a decoration from the Vatican. 534 It will be recalled, of course, that one facet of the OSS - orchestrated campaign against the Nazis and the Italian fascists was known as Operation Underworld. As we saw in Chapter 7, it was Meyer Lansky w ho was the middle man between the OSS and organized crime, helping arrange for Sicilian Mafia support for the invading Allied troops in Italy. Angleton, of course, was point man in Europe for the project. (That Permindex was based in Rome, may thus be no c oincidence, considering Angleton's long - standing connections with the city, where even his father held the National Cash Register franchise for Italy.) 535 In any event there is no question whatsoever that Clay Shaw and James Angleton — along with Major Bloo mfield of Permindex — had long moved in the same closely related circles on a wide variety of fronts. MORE STRANGE CONNECTIONS That Clay Shaw's contacts in the Mossad - linked Permindex entity had a wide - ranging array of international interests in the world of intrigue is further evidenced by some of the other personalities involved. Among those who were either investors in Permindex or who shared seats on the board of Permindex were several interesting characters with equally interesting connections. Among t hem were:   Ferenc Nagy. The former premier of Hungary was a fierce anti - communist who maintained close connections not only to Israel's allies in the America CIA, but also to the anti - Castro Cuban colony in Miami, itself practically a joint operating subsid iary of both the CIA and the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. (Nagy himself later settled in Dallas, Texas and was residing there at the time of the Kennedy assassination.) 536   Hans Seligman. A member of the family which controlled the Seligman Bank of Bas el and whose extended family were, in America, part of the famous \"Our Crowd\" (German Jewish elite) in New York City during the latter period of the 19th century. Seligman was intimately involved with the Israel - oriented Zionist agency known as the Jewish Colonization Association. 537"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"256 The Twain Shall Meet [195]   Morris Dalitz. The former Cleveland bootlegger - turned - Las Vegas casino gambling czar. Dalitz was a longtime Lansky intimate who was Benjamin Siegel's successor as Lansky's point man in Las Vegas. 538 As we saw in Chapter 10, Dalitz later employed \"racket buster\" G. Robert Blakey as a consultant/character witness in a libel action in which Dalitz was contesting charges that his La Costa Country Club in Carlsbad, California was linked to organized crime. It was shortly thereaft er that Blakey was placed in charge of the House Assassinations Committee investigation of the JFK murder. Dalitz himself, as noted in Chapter 10, was also a longtime fund - raiser for the Israeli lobby in the United States and honored by the aforementioned Anti - Defamation League (ADL ) for his services.   Carlos Prio Socarras. The President of Cuba from 1948 - 1952, Prio Socarras had been a front - man for Meyer Lansky's partner - in - crime, Cuban strongman Fulgencio Batista. In fact, it was Lansky who persuaded Bati sta with a hefty bribe to \"step down\" in favor of Prio Socarras. 539 And as we saw in Chapter 14 Prio was engaged in gun - running with a business partner whose name is now more than a footnote in history: Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. No wonder then, that the Italian journal, Paesa Sera, would be moved to comment: \"It is a fact that the CMC is nevertheless the point of contact for a number of persons who, in certain respects, have somewhat equivocal ties whose common denominator is an anti - communism s o strong that it would swallow up all those in the world who have fought for decent relations between East and West, including Kennedy.\" 540 CMC/Permindex — it might also be added even more particularly — is nevertheless the point of contact for a number of pe rsons who, in certain respects, have somewhat equivocal ties whose common denominator is a devotion to the cause of Israel. ISRAEL'S ROLE COMES FULL CIRCLE As we have noted, however, it is the Tibor Rosenbaum - BCI connection with Permindex that points mos t definitely toward the Israeli Mossad interest in Permindex. BCI, as we have seen, was very much a creature of Israel and its Mossad. Among the directors of Rosenbaum's BCI was Ernest Israel Japhet, also chairman and president of the Bank Leumi, the large st bank in Israel. BCI and Bank Leumi were involved in the diamond trade and tied into Far East drug trafficking. 541 (We have already examined, in Chapter 6 and Chapter 12, Lansky's central role in global drug - trafficking in Southeast Asia, all of which wa s made further possible — under CIA cover — as a consequence of American involvement in the Vietnam conflict.) Two other directors of BCI — as we noted in Chapter 7 — were Ed Levinson, front man at the Fremont Casino in Las Vegas for Lansky's close friend, Joseph \"Doc\" Stacher, who died in exile in Israel and John Pullman, Lansky's international money courier. Rosenbaum's other operation, the"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"[196] Final Judgment 257 Swiss - Israel Trade Bank owned one - third interest in the Paz group, which had been a Rothschild family entity, maintaining control over Israel's oil and petrochemical industry. 542 EISENBERG AND FEINBERG — AGAIN As we noted in Chapter 7, associates of Rosenbaum in the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank included Shaul Eisenberg, a key figure in Israel's nuclear bomb development — the central point of conflict between JFK and Israel — and New York businessman Abe Feinberg. In Chapter 8 we learned that Eisenberg later became a business associate of CIA figure Theodore Shackley. Shackley, as we discovered in Chapter 11, was the CIA's chief of stat ion in Miami during the CIA - Lansky Crime Syndicate plots against Fidel Castro. And, in Chapter 12, we learned, it was Shackley who was CIA chief of station in Laos during the period of the close working relationship between the CIA and the Lansky syndicate in the global drug racket. It was Feinberg, as we saw in Chapter 4, who was the American Jewish fund - raising contact of the 1960 Kennedy for President campaign. Feinberg's heavy - handed tactics so infuriated Kennedy that he privately told a close friend th at, as president, he intended to enforce changes in campaign fund - raising regulations that would prevent powerful groups such as the American pro - Israel lobby from wielding so much influence. Feinberg, additionally, of course, was close to Israeli Prime Mi nister David Ben - Gurion and, in fact, helped arrange the bitter meeting between Kennedy and Ben - Gurion recounted in Chapter 5. The manager of Rosenbaum and Feinberg's Swiss - Israel Trade Bank was Gen. Julius Klein, a U.S. Army officer, who had engaged in il legally re - routing shiploads of supplies and equipment scheduled to go to post - war Germany to the Haganah, the military forces of the Jews in Palestine. Klein conducted this enterprise while chief of the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps in Europe at the end of World War II. (Later, in Appendix Four, we'll meet Klein's protégé who had an unusually close relationship with a key member of the Warren Commission cover - up of the JFK assassination. However, Klein's services on behalf of the state of Israel were even more significant. It was Klein who had been involved in setting up Israel's Mossad and in training its officers. Klein worked alongside Sir William Stephenson in this particular venture. 543 In Chapter 7, we learned of Sir William's clandestine allian ce with Meyer Lansky and his crime syndicate in the so - called Operation Underworld apparatus aimed against Axis intelligence during World War II. Stephenson, of course, had been the director of Britain's intelligence operations in the United States — in the critical years preceding and during World War II — and was the aforementioned Major Louis M. Bloomfield's"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"258 The Twain S hall Meet [197] operating superior. It was during his days working with the American OSS and Naval Intelligence — and the Lansky Crime Syndicate — that Stephenson cemente d his ties with the Jewish anti - Nazi underground. According to intelligence historian Richard Deacon: \"Stephenson received a great deal of intelligence from Jewish scientists. This particular operation, though seemingly far removed from the story of Palest ine, in the long run greatly helped Israeli Intelligence in the early days of the state of Israel. Some of these scientists who had become friends with Stephenson were encouraged to develop their talents in the cause of Allied intelligence and they not onl y worked for Britain in World War II, but later assisted the Israeli Secret Service.\" 544 What's more, it might be noted, Stephenson was a close personal advisor to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Here, almost certainly, Stephenson had contact, du ring those early days, with a young American who became a friend of Churchill — Clay Shaw, that American Army officer detailed to the Office of Strategic Services. THE PERMINDEX PLOT Obviously, the connections (at an intimate level) between Tibor Rosenbaum 's Israeli Mossad banking operation, the Banque de Credit International, and a wide - ranging array of figures tied closely to the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and — even — to Clay Shaw, a member of the Permindex board of directors, brings the conspiracy ful l circle. That BCI was one of the primary shareholders of the Permindex entity clearly points toward a Mossad role in the Permindex plot that ended the life of John F. Kennedy. However, there is much, much more as we shall see. LANSKY'S MIAMI - GENEVA COURI ER Research by former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow not only sheds light on the connections between Lansky's Miami banks and Mossad officer Tibor Rosenbaum's BCI, but also provides us evidence of a role by Meyer Lansky in the assassination of John F. K ennedy. Shortly after Morrow had published his first book, Betrayal, in which he described his own connections through the CIA with a number of the figures involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy, he was contacted by a young man with an incredible sto ry he wanted to tell. According to Morrow, \"In our initial conversation, the young man claimed his father, an ex - Air Force colonel, and others working for the CIA had prior knowledge that President Kennedy was going to be assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963 . . . \"The intelligence officer's son then made a wild accusation. He asserted that his father had been tied into organized crime and had been a bagman for at least one of the payoffs relating to the presidential assassination, transporting a lar ge sum of money to Haiti for payoff purposes during the summer of 1963.\" 545"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"[198] Final Judgment 259 This young man told Morrow that his father was associated with a mob courier. The courier in question was Mickey Weiner. Pursuing the Weiner lead further, Morrow learned from a nother source that tape recordings had been uncovered in which Weiner had participated in conversations relating to the circumstances of the Kennedy assassination. According to Morrow's source, Albert Moakler, \"The tapes were indicative that there was a co nversation going on which was more than idle gossip. It definitely concerned Jersey and Miami . . . the areas, people in the areas. Something concerned with the assassination.\" 546 (Miami, of course, was Meyer Lansky's base of operations. New Jersey, as w e saw in Chapter 7, was the base of Lansky's Mafia associate, mobster Jerry Catena who was responsible for distribution of \"skim\" money from Lansky's Las Vegas gambling operations to Lansky's organized crime associates in the northern states.) Morrow also determined that Weiner made regular runs between Switzerland and Miami where he would visit the Bank of Miami Beach. 547 Weiner, obviously, was one of Lansky's couriers between his banking operations in Miami and those of the Israeli Mossad's Tibor Rosenba um and the Banque de Credit International in Switzerland. Thus, it's clear that Lansky's courier definitely had \"inside\" information about the JFK assassination. We may even go so far as to speculate that it was Lansky's courier who was providing funds fro m Permindex to the assassination conspirators stateside. ANOTHER ISRAEL CONNECTION A \"high level financial backer\" of the Permindex operation, according to Paesa Sera, was one Dr. David Biegun, national secretary of the National Committee for Labor Israe l, Inc., based in New York. This committee was the American affiliate of the Israeli Histadrut for which Permindex board chairman Louis M. Bloomfield was a chief fundraiser. 548 Flammonde, despite his excellent research, failed to carry this connection fur ther. And note also that ex - CIA man Philip Agee has said that the Committee for Labor Israel is often used as a CIA cover. 549 Biegun's role in Permindex was explicitly important — even central to the operation of Permindex. In fact, it was Biegun who oversa w the liquidation of CMC/Permindex after the company was expelled from Switzerland and Italy in 1962, subsequently relocating the operation to Johannesburg, South Africa. 550 (South Africa, it might be noted, has long been engaged in intimate international intrigues in conjunction with Israel.) Paesa Sera speculated that [CMC/Permindex] \"was a creature of the CIA . . . set up as a cover for the transfer of CIA . . . funds in Italy for illegal political - espionage activities.\" 551 The Italian journal, however, seems to have missed the multiple Israeli connections that we have explored in these pages."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"260 The Twain Shall Meet [199] P LO TS TO ASSASSINA TE CH ARLES DeGAU L LE Public controversy surrounding Permindex, resulting in its expulsion from Switzerland and Italy, involved the role of Perm index in assassination plots aimed at French President Charles DeGaulle. And as we shall see, it is here that we find even more intriguing connections between Permindex and the JFK assassination. Earlier in these pages, as we have seen, the rebel Secret Ar my Organization — known by its acronym OAS — was bitterly opposed to DeGaulle's decision to grant independence to Arab Algeria. (It was, as we noted in Chapter 4, John F. Kennedy who, as a young senator, riled the Israeli lobby by calling for Algerian independ ence in 1957.) The OAS launched numerous assassination attempts against DeGaulle, none of which were successful, of course, but they did later inspire Frederick Forsythe's famous novel (later turned into a popular motion picture), The Day of the Jackal. Fo llo wi ng an in vesti gatio n o f o ne attemp t, in 19 6 2, Fr ench intelligence (the SDECE) charged that Permindex laundered money into the OAS coffers to finance the attempt on DeGaulle's life. 552 According to DeGaulle's biographer, Jean Lacouture, \"for moral as w ell as political reasons, [the OAS leadership] considered it necessary to sacrifice the Head of State, either physically or politically, so that Algeria would remain French.\" 553 SOUSTELLE, THE OAS AND THE IRGUN One of the harshest French critics of Alger ian independence was Jewish - born convert to Christianity, Jacques Soustelle, former governor - general of Algeria. Described by Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi as being known as one of \"Israel's friends in France,\" 554 Soustelle, as French Atomic Ene rgy Minister from 1958 to 1959, cooperated closely with Yuval Ne'eman, the father of Israel's atomic bomb project, in helping Israel develop the groundwork for a nuclear arsenal. 555 Bitterly condemning Degaulle's reversal on Algeria, Soustelle went into se lf - imposed exile. 556 Although Soustelle himself denied any contacts with the OAS, 5 5 7 he was one of its primary supporters, winning the plaudits of OAS partisans who promulgated the joint Israeli - OAS propaganda myth that Algerian independence would establi sh a Soviet foothold in North Africa. In fact, Israeli intelligence came to Soustelle's aid when he went into exile. In 1962 Soustelle took up \"hiding in Rome in the house of a furniture dealer whose brother was a representative of the [Israeli] Irgun.\" 558 Interestingly enough, according to Paesa Sera, the Italian journal which publicized the role of Permindex in the plots against DeGaulle, former Hungarian premier and Permindex board member Ferenc Nagy was a \"munificent contributor\" 559 to Jacques Soustelle and the OAS."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"[200] Final Judgment 261 (What's more, we now know, one of the key bases of financial support for Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum's BCI — the key force behind Permindex and the plots against DeGaulle — were \"clandestine deposits of undeclared funds from French Jews,\" 56 0 not to m ention, of course, the criminal funds from the Lansky crime syndicate.) One French military leader who emerged as an OAS leader, General Antoine Argoud said, \"the physical elimination of the Head of State poses no moral problem for any of us . . . We are a ll convinced . . . that DeGaulle has deserved the supreme punishment a hundred times over.\" 561 However, there were other elements that proved supportive of the French rebels within the OAS. According to historian Alexander Harrison: \"Factors that seemed to favor the success of the [OAS] efforts to keep Algeria French [included]:   The complicity of the 'old boy' networks within the various intelligence agencies, most notably the French secret service, [the SDECE] and the Direction de la Surveillance du Territ oire [responsible for internal counterespionage] both of which at times placed loyalty to a former comrade - in - arms . . . above loyalty to the government; and   Possible logistical help from countries [such as] the United States that had been hostile t o DeGaulle since the first days of the Resistance in World War II and viewed his pro - Soviet stance as a threat to Western hegemony in the Mediterranean.\" 562 (Earlier we learned of the CIA's covert support for the OAS, despite opposition to the OAS by JFK who had been an ardent advocate for Algerian independence much to the dismay of Israel's lobby in America.) ISRAEL AND THE OAS Not surprisingly, according to historian Harrison, whose OAS sympathies are apparent \"Some of the most ardent supporters of the OAS in Algeria were Jews.\" 5 6 3 What's more, notes Harrison, \"a Jewish branch of the OAS was created.\" 564 Another historian, Paul Henissart, has also noted an Israeli connection with the OAS. According to Henissart, \"[The OAS] attracted hotheads including s ome Jews who belonged to Irgun Zvai Leumi, the Israeli underground military organization. They were recruited by the OAS as specialists in clandestine warfare.\" 565 He notes additionally that while there were Jewish defense groups established in Algeria, \"o fficial Israeli delegations in Algeria to organize emigration of Jews from the coastal cities were not averse to aiding these self - defense groups. The Israeli government, however, never confirmed any connection with them.\" 566 Nonetheless as Israeli histori an Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi has pointed out, there is evidence of official Israeli support of the OAS: \"During 1961 and 1962, there were numerous reports of Israeli support for the French OAS movement in Algeria.\" 567"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"2 62 The Twain Shall Meet [201] He notes that the Israelis had assisted the French in the Algerian war of independence between 1954 and 1962. Then, when Algeria was finally independent and sought admission to the UN, only Israel voted against it. Beit Hallahmi quotes another historian, Stewart Steven, as saying, \"When in 1961 the OAS was created, it was a natural development that Israel, as keen on [French retention of Algeria as a colony] as the OAS themselves, should lock themselves into the [OAS]. \"568 So it was that Israeli intelligence — and its allies in the American CIA — ha d formed a close working alliance with the very forces that were attempting to destroy French President Charles DeGaulle. At the same time, in fact, these same elements were using their Permindex connection in yet another plot, this one aimed at the life o f John F. Kennedy. THE OAS, PERMINDEX AND NEW ORLEANS There is, interestingly, a New Orleans connection here. According to a report later issued by DeGaulle's secret service, the SDECE, Israel's Bank Hapoalim supplied funds to the OAS through the office of former FBI agent and CIA contract operative, Guy Banister, in New Orleans. 569 Banister's agent, Maurice Brooks Gatlin, in turn, carried the money to the OAS in Paris. 57 0 (Several years later Gatlin died in Panama when he fell — or was pushed — from a hotel balcony.) Gatlin, evidently, had many interesting international affairs. When a Latin American regional conference of a global anti - communist confederation was set in place, organized by CIA operative and Banister contact, E. Howard Hunt, the chairman of t hat conference was Antonio Valladares. This same Valladares, based in Guatemala, also happened to serve as an attorney for New Orleans Mafia chief Carlos Marcello whom, as we have seen, was assisting in financing Banister's anti - communist activities. In at tendance at the conference, which ultimately merged into the World Anti - Communist League, was Maurice Brooks Gatlin, 571 suggesting that the New Orleans connection to the CIA and other worldwide intrigue was very strong indeed. The aforementioned Bank Hapoa lim was the bank established by Israel's labor bund, the Histadrut, for which Permindex chairman Louis Bloomfield served as chief fundraiser in Canada. Guy Banister's activities were explored earlier in Chapter 10, Chapter 11 and Chapter 14. According to G ilbert LeCavelier, an associate of the late Bernard Fensterwald (a leading JFK assassination researcher), Banister's office also served as a New Orleans headquarters for OAS - connected mercenaries. Among those OAS mercenaries was Jean Souetre who, we noted in Chapter 12, was reported to have been picked up in Dallas on November 22, 1963 and expelled from the United States. 572 In Chapter 16 we will explore Souetre's activities further. Banister, the former FBI and Naval intelligence operative, oversaw CIA - bac ked anti - Castro gun - running and intelligence operations out of an office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. Closely linked to the anti - Castro"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"[202] Final Judgment 263 Cuban movement, Banister's operation functioned with the support of the CIA. Former CIA contract agent Robert Mo rrow asserts in his book, Betrayal, that Permindex board member Clay Shaw was, in fact, Banister's immediate superior in coordinating CIA operations out of New Orleans. Thus, we have CIA asset Clay Shaw, serving on the board of Permindex, which is in turn operating in conjunction with Banister's office in plots against Charles DeGaulle. And in the same period we have Banister (and Shaw) involved in manipulating the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans just prior to the assassination of John F. Ken nedy. Among others, Banister was associated with former CIA pilot and anti - Castro adventurer David Ferrie (one of the key figures in Jim Garrison's case against Clay Shaw). Ferrie, as we have seen, also had a long - standing connection with Lee Harvey Oswald and, by all accounts, was associating regularly with Oswald in New Orleans in the summer of 1963. And we now know for certain that Ferrie and Shaw were intimately acquainted. The connections between Ferrie, Shaw, Banister and Oswald do come full circle. F ormer CIA man Morrow also reports that during his activities with the CIA, working in conjunction with David Ferrie, he and Ferrie visited a warehouse in Europe where vast amounts of arms were stored — arms intended for the anti - Castro Cuban underground. The warehouse was a Permindex operation. 573 Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, has been quoted as having said that Oswald was a regular visitor to 544 Camp Street engaged in some sort of \"intelligence\" work. 574 In fact, as is now generally acknowledge d, it appears as though Oswald was being set up as a \"pro - Castro\" patsy. BANISTER'S ISRAELI CONNECTION However, interestingly enough, there is yet another Israeli connection to the New Orleans scenario that set up Lee Harvey Oswald as the fall guy in the JFK assassination plot. It turns out that one of Banister's longstanding friends and fellow anti - communists was one A. I. (Bee) Botnick. 575 Botnick was a key figure in the New Orleans regional office of the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, which is now known to maintain close ties to the Israeli Mossad. Botnick, who reportedly considered himself \"a super communist hunter,\" was obsessed with communism and, like Banister, believed communism to be a major force behind the civil rights movement . 576 (In 1993 it was reported that the ADL had spied extensively on the late Dr. Martin Luther King and then turned its findings over to J. Edgar Hoover, Banister's former superior at the FBI.) 577 In Chapter 7 and in Chapter 10 we noted the close links between the ADL and the Lansky Crime Syndicate, itself tied in turn to the CIA and to Israeli intelligence, most notably through the Permindex link discussed in this chapter.) At the national level, and under Botnick in New Orleans, the ADL had a history o f deploying agents into left - wing groups in order to spy on their activities. This, of course, fits precisely into the profile of Lee Harvey"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"264 The Twain Shall Meet [203] Oswald's \"leftist\" and \"pro - Castro\" activities in New Orleans during the summer of 1963, operating a \"Fair Play f or Cuba Committee\" out of Banister's intelligence operation at 544 Camp Street. What is additionally intriguing is that, according to former ADL general counsel and intelligence chief Arnold Forster, much of the ADL's \"fact finding\" (i.e. spying) utilized agents \"employed by an outside investigative agency operating as an independent contractor.\" 578 So, in light of the close association between Botnick and Banister, it seems quite likely Botnick contracted out ADL work out to his fellow anti - communist. Wha t's more, according to the ADL's Forster, many of the ADL's fact - finders were \"retired local or federal government investigators\" 579 — such as, perhaps, a likely former American intelligence agent named Oswald who had once done covert work in the Soviet Unio n. We can only wonder if, in fact, Lee Harvey Oswald's \"left wing\" activities were actually being financed by the ADL. Was Oswald, indeed, being utilized to infiltrate left - wing groups by Banister ostensibly as part of what appeared to be a fact - finding mi ssion for the ADL but which actually was an intelligence operation with an ulterior motive? It is thus not so extraordinary to suggest that perhaps Oswald was being \"sheep - dipped\" as a \"pro - Castro\" agitator by the ADL (under the guise of ADL \"fact finding\" ) which was functioning as a conduit for the Mossad and its CIA allies. Quite convenient indeed. A 'THIRD FORCE'? Although he does not pinpoint the ADL as a force behind Banister's activities, respected JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott has l ent credence to the possibility that there was much more to Banister's operations than would seem to meet the eye. According to Scott: \"Disagreement arises . . . as to who was paying for Banister's anti - Communist activities: governmental intelligence, the New Orleans Mafia, or some third force allied with both together.\" [emphasis added] Those stressing the intelligence angle, notes Scott, point to Banister's FBI and CIA and Office of Naval Intelligence connections while those stressing the \"Mafia\" point to Banister's connections, through David Ferrie and others, to New Orleans Mafia chief Carlos Marcello. As Scott notes, however, \"a third and more likely possibility is that both Oswald and Banister were working for what was in effect a third force: an intel ligence - Mafia gray alliance, rooted in the deep political economy of New Orleans.\" 58 0 And as we have seen in this chapter and elsewhere, the ADL did indeed have a strong root in the deep political economy of New Orleans, even indeed in the Clay Shaw connec tion. \"As to the story that Oswald was an FBI informant,\" writes Scott, \"I doubt that Oswald was directly on the FBI payroll. A more likely possibility is that he worked for a private security agency which in turn reported to the FBI, the way that ex - FBI a nd ex - Official of Naval"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"[204] Final Judgment 265 Intelligence agent Guy Banister, according to a CIA document, reported to the FBI in New Orleans.\" 581 [emphasis added] That the ADL did, in fact, report back to the FBI, a long - standing relationship cemented by J. Edgar Hoover him self, is now common knowledge, a fact that we shall examine further in Chapter 17. The FBI files of another prominent Black civil rights leader of the 1960's, Dick Gregory, demonstrate conclusively that the ADL which was actually monitoring his public lect ures and then turning the information over to the FBI as part of its COINTELPRO operations. And as we saw in Chapter 7, it was COINTELPRO, carried out by the FBI's Division Five, that was under the direct control of William Sullivan, who was effectively a CIA \"mole\" inside the FBI for his close friend, the Mossad's CIA ally, James J. Angleton. (In Chapter 17 we will explore the activities of the ADL further, paying particular attention to the apparent manipulation of media coverage of the controversy over t he JFK assassination by the ADL and by ADL - linked sources in New Orleans. Furthermore, in Appendix Two we shall examine a little - explored link between Lee Harvey Oswald and at least one covert government informant who almost certainly had connections with the ADL. And in Appendix Three we will learn much more about Guy Banister's strange \"right wing\" connections that actually point toward the ADL.) Whatever the case, it is very clear that the Mossad and the CIA had a direct hand in the strange activities of Clay Shaw, Guy Banister, David Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans during the summer of 1963. Both the Mossad and the CIA were intimately tied with the Permindex plot against French President Charles DeGaulle and with the Permindex plot against Jo hn F. Kennedy. In the bloody conflict over Algerian Arab independence both Kennedy and DeGaulle found themselves on the same side of the issue — and in opposition to the Mossad and its allies in the CIA. A VISIT FROM PERMINDEX That New Orleans District Att orney Jim Garrison was indeed on the right track is illustrated by a strange visit that Garrison got during the early days of his investigation. A Denver oilman, later identified by investigators as John King, appeared in Garrison's office and offered to a rrange the district attorney's appointment to a federal judgeship in return for Garrison's abandonment of his investigation. King very clearly had inside information about the nature of Garrison's inquiry and was obviously interested in shutting it down be fore it went any further. Garrison would not be bribed, however, and promptly showed the gentleman to the door. It just so happens that during the very period of King's mysterious visit to New Orleans, the \"Denver oilman\" was engaged in lucrative internati onal business dealings with Bernie Cornfeld, the Geneva - based head of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). King's other interests included oil drilling offshore of the Sinai peninsula, Arab territory seized by the Israelis in"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"266 The Twain Shall Meet [205] 1967. 582 King's partner Cor nfeld, as we saw in Chapter 7 and in Chapter 9, was, in fact, the protégé and front man of Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum, founder of the Banque De Credit International (BCI) and a central financial figure behind Permindex. King's visit was very clearly a friendly offer from Permindex. They hoped to silence Garrison before his inquiry went further — before he made the Clay Shaw connection, before he discovered the real origins of the Permindex plot that led to the murder of John F. Kennedy. Permindex and its backers w ere determined to stop the investigation in its tracks. John King's visit to New Orleans is very clear evidence, indeed, that the role of Clay Shaw and Permindex is the key to the JFK assassination mystery. An interesting footnote: By 1967, a key player in the Permindex network of Tibor Rosenbaum and John King was the super - lawyer who represented IOS interests in Washington: Myer Feldman. 583 Feldman, whom we first met in Chapter 5 as JFK's liaison to the American Jewish community, after leaving the White H ouse, signed on as a well - paid henchman for the very interests behind the JFK assassination and cover - up. And today, it just so happens, Feldman apparently serves as an attorney for the Kennedy family itself, overseeing the most private legal matters of th e family of the slain American president. A small world indeed. THE STRANGE WORLD OF CLAY SHAW Those who have been most strident in their denunciations of Jim Garrison for his indictment of Clay Shaw are among those who push the myth that \"The Mafia Kill ed JFK.\" They suggest that Clay Shaw was some innocent figure who was only rehabilitating French Quarter carriage houses. Yet, despite the link between Permindex and the Lansky Syndicate money laundering Banque De Credit International, those who say that \" The Mafia Killed JFK\" say absolutely nothing about Shaw's very firm ties — through Permindex — to this criminal banking entity, very much linked to \"the Mafia\" through Lansky. To disregard the Israeli linkage to Permindex is to avoid the truth altogether. This is why those who seek to point the finger of blame toward \"the Mafia,\" for example, are so determined to vindicate Clay Shaw. To look Shaw's direction is to look in the direction of Israel — and that is why it was so vital that Garrison's investigation had to be scuttled at all costs. Obviously, there's much more to the Permindex controversy than many people would like to admit. And in this author's judgment it is because of the Permindex link to Israel and its Mossad that some JFK assassination researchers have chosen to ignore the truth before them. WHAT ABOUT THE 'NAZI' CONNECTION? There have been those who have proclaimed Permindex to have been some sort of \"Nazi\" remnant that survived World War II. The leading promoter of this theory was Mae Brussell, an eccentric researcher who"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"[206] Final Judgment 267 became an icon for many obsessed with the JFK assassination, among them one Dave Emory who insists to this day that \"The Nazis Killed JFK.\" Yet, there is something about Miss Brussell's background that is significant in light of the Israeli role in the JFK assassination as dissected here. Brussell was the daughter of Rabbi Edgar Magnin, the spiritual leader of Hollywood's Jewish community — next to the New York Jewish community the most significant force in the pro - Israel lobby i n America. For this reason alone Mrs. Brussell would not be inclined to follow Permindex to its Israeli antecedents. Mrs. Brussell and her acolyte, Dave Emory, contended that high - ranking former Nazis such as General Reinhard Gehlen who were brought under the wing of American intelligence following World War II were ultimately responsible for the Kennedy assassination — through Permindex. However, the fact is that Israeli intelligence was working closely with the Gehlen organization in the post - World War II p eriod. John Loftus and Mark Aarons have written of how Israeli operatives — although they found the new relationship distasteful — did indeed work with reputed former Nazi war criminals in Gehlen's operation. What's more, the Israelis had completely infiltrate d the Gehlen organization. According to Loftus and Aarons: \"They knew exactly what General Gehlen was doing . . . After Israel was born, sections of the Mossad arrived inside Gehlen's base to receive special training . . . Even he had no idea how many of h is staff also were reporting to Tel Aviv . . . Whatever Gehlen saw, the Israelis saw.\" 584 So if indeed (as some say) it was a \"Nazi\" plot that killed JFK, it seems highly unlikely that the plot somehow got by the intrepid Israelis. But, as we know now, it was not a Nazi plot — the fantasies of Dave Emory and Mae Brussell notwithstanding. Permindex was an Israeli front — not a Nazi front. It is probably worth noting, for the record, that the first nationwide publicity that Mrs. Brussell's theory that \"the Nazis Killed JFK\" received was when it appeared in the pages of the short - lived magazine, The Rebel, published by highly controversial pornographer Larry Flynt. 585 Although Flynt had indeed funded legitimate independent research into the JFK assassination some t ime earlier (which some suggest may have led to the later attempt on Flynt's life), the Brussell article was not part of that earlier effort that came out of the Flynt publishing empire. It is hard to say precisely what motivates Flynt, a complex individua l indeed, but we do know one thing: according to George magazine, published by no less than John F. Kennedy, Jr., Flynt, at least recently, has emerged as a substantial contributor to the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith. 586 So in light of what we do know about the ADL and its multiple links to those intimately involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy, this is interesting indeed. Despite all of Mae Brussell's ruminations, there is ironically, a genuine and bizarre \"Nazi\" connection to Permin dex that is either misunderstood or has been deliberately obscured but which does further toward our"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268 The Twain Shall Meet [207] understanding of Permindex as a transnational point of contact for the Mossad and its allies in the CIA and organized crime. THE 'FASCIST JEWS' The fac t is that not only Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum but also Permindex figures Georges and Ernst Mandel were part of a Zionist operation that had its origins in a multi - layered intelligence venture that laid the groundwork for not only the establishment of th e state of Israel but the escape of former Nazi leaders out of Europe and into the Gehlen organization (and elsewhere) following the close of World War II. According to the aforementioned Loftus and Aarons, writing in The Secret War Against the Jews: \"Duri ng World War II Soviet intelligence used a network of supposedly \"fascist Jews,\" code named Max, to penetrate the inner circles of the Third Reich and to destroy the German army on the Eastern front. The Nazis believed that the Max network was their secret intelligence source inside the Kremlin, and it did in fact give 'good' intelligence to the Germans but it was strictly controlled by the Communists. \"The Jews of the Max network were mostly Communist double agents, but they also were Jews who defected to the Zionist cause toward the end of the war and revealed [future CIA director] Allen Dulles' [pre - war and war - time] secret [financial and intelligence] deals with the Nazis. \"The Zionists,\" according to Loftus and Aarons, \"blackmailed Dulles' [CIA] protégé , James Angleton, into setting up a parallel smuggling system for Jews and fugitive Nazis.\" 587 It was in Chapter 8 that we learned of Angleton's role in the Jewish refugee network that ultimately evolved into the modern - day Mossad. That the Israelis were b lackmailing Angleton, according to Loftus and Aarons, who are undoubtedly pro - Israeli partisans, explains much about Angleton's behavior throughout his CIA career and in the events which involved Angleton in the circumstances of the JFK assassination, more about which we shall discuss in Chapter 16. A TRANSNATIONAL ARRANGEMENT In light of all this, we now understand why Zionist operatives collaborated with so - called \"Nazi\" forces in the strange transnational entity known as Permindex. There were — as Peter Dale Scott said — common modes of interaction between a variety of interests involved in complex, multi - centered intrigues where these diverse elements, each with distinctive motives, worked together on common projects, each for their own ends. There is inde ed much more to Permindex than we have been told by some JFK assassination researchers, but ultimately the truth is that Permindex was, more than anything, predominantly a transnational arrangement with Israel's intrigues as its driving force."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"[208] Final Judgment 269 Israel's w orldwide connections — particularly with the anti - Kennedy forces within the CIA and the CIA - linked Lansky crime empire, along with the French OAS rebels and Charles DeGaulle's enemies within his own intelligence service — made possible the network through whic h the plan to kill JFK was carried out. Permindex was in the center of it all. Through the so - called \"false flag\" technique in which the Mossad is so skilled (as we saw in Chapter 3), \"Mafia\" figures, anti - Castro Cubans, low - level CIA operatives and an ass ortment of other strange figures were drawn into the Permindex web behind the JFK assassination conspiracy. In the end, however, it was Permindex board member Clay Shaw who became the one person (aside from the hapless Lee Harvey Oswald) to be charged with having participated in the conspiracy. Whether Shaw knew of the impending assassination will probably never be known. That Shaw was trafficking with the likes of David Ferrie and Guy Banister — Oswald's immediate handlers — has now been firmly established. Wh ether Shaw knew that Oswald, ultimately, would be the patsy is another mystery. Nonetheless, the Clay Shaw link to the assassination — and to Permindex — points directly toward the Mossad role in the conspiracy.

The tentacles of Permindex reached far and wide, inextricably intertwini ng the Mossad, the CIA and the Lansky Cri me Syndicate. Although, recently, Warren Commission enthusiast Max Holland penned an essay in the spring 2001 issue of The Wilson Quarterly purporting to \"prove\" that the Soviet KGB was responsible for effectively s ponsoring \"disinformation\" — namely the Paese Sera articles that linked Clay Shaw to Permindex — Holland's opus does no more than to prove that Permindex was the subject of controversy in the first place. But, more pointedly, Holland's essay fails to address t he real question: if Permindex was NOT a CIA front, was it instead an Israeli operation? Final Judgment answers the question beyond any shadow of a doubt, but it's not likely Holland will respond to that. In our next chapter we will review, at last, the mo st recent, startling and definitive evidence which proves that it was Israel's ally at the CIA headquarters, James Jesus Angleton, who played a key role in the assassination conspiracy and cover - up. What's more, we will examine important new information wh ich suggests that there was much more happening in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 than otherwise might meet the eye.

Mark Lane's Plausible Denial proved c onclusively that the CIA had a hand in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. As we saw in Chapter 9, Lane's book told how the Washington - based Spotlight newspaper's libel trial with ex - CIA man E. Howard Hunt brought into a Florida courtroom the f irst hard evidence linking the CIA to the Kennedy assassination. As noted previously, Lane agreed to serve as The Spotlight's defense attorney after Hunt won a $650,000 libel judgment against the populist weekly. It was Lane who successfully handled The Sp otlight's defense after the case again went to trial after the initial libel verdict was overturned. The libel action stemmed from an article published in the pages of The Spotlight in 1978. The article was written by Victor Marchetti, an ex - CIA executive officer who had become internationally famous after he published his best - selling critique, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, the first book ever censored prior to publication by the CIA. After leaving the CIA, Marchetti became a journalist, specializi ng in matters relating to the CIA and the intelligence community in general. As such he was a recognized authority in his field and had done a number of intelligence - related articles for The Spotlight, among numerous other publications, both here in the Un ited States and abroad. As a consequence, when Marchetti approached The Spotlight with a rather intriguing article which gave an interesting new slant on the JFK"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"[210] Final Judgment 271 assassination furor (in the midst of the House Assassinations Committee investigation), the editors of the weekly newspaper were interested. CIA TO FRAME HUNT? Marchetti's article suggested that upper echelon executives of the CIA had decided to frame E. Howard Hunt for involvement in the Kennedy assassination. Not that Hunt was involved in the crime — simply that the CIA had decided to frame Hunt for the deed. This distinction is important. Over the years, several assassination buffs had claimed that the famous photographs taken in Dealey Plaza of three so - called \"tramps\" being led away from the scene by police officers revealed Hunt as one of those tramps. This story was picked up the tabloids and given wide play. A CIA - MOSSAD CONCOCTION? However, there are those who believe that the \"Hunt as a tramp\" story was, in fact, deliberately trumped up as part of the CIA's scheme to frame Hunt for involvement in the assassination. It was the CIA's plan to implicate Hunt that Victor Marchetti exposed in The Spotlight. The leading promoter of the theory that Hunt was one of the \"tramps\" in Dallas is A. J. Weberman who maintains very close ties to the Jewish Defense League. Weberman has also been closely associated with Mordechai Levi, a known agent provocateur of the Israeli Mossad's propaganda and intelligence arm, the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'ri th, which we examine in further detail in Chapter 17. (Levi was also active in the Jewish Defense League (JDL), created by militant Rabbi Meir Kahane. In Chapter 8 we saw that Kahane was a CIA asset and protégé of Jay Lovestone who handled CIA liaison with the Meyer Lansky - linked French Corsican and Sicilian Mafias. Lovestone's operation was directed out of James J. Angleton's Israeli desk at the CIA.) It may very well be that the \"Hunt as a tramp\" story being touted by Weberman was indeed a CIA - Mossad conc oction to further muddy the waters. What is interesting is that in 1975 — precisely at the time when Weberman was publishing and promoting a book that named Hunt as one of the tramps — a strange letter appeared, anonymously, in the mailbox of another (and more reliable) assassination researcher, Penn Jones, Jr. The letter was written in Spanish and its envelope earned a Mexico City postmark. The letter accompanied another letter which read as follows: \"Dear Mr. Hunt, I would like information concerding [sic] my position. I a m a s k i n g o n l y f o r i n f o r m a t i o n . I a m s u g g e s t i n g t h a t w e disc u ss t h e ma t t er f ully bef o re a ny st ep s a r e t a ken by me or anyone else. Thank you,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"272 Double Cross in Dallas? [211] Lee Harvy [sic] Oswald.\" 588 Subsequent analyses suggested that the letter may or may not have been O swald's handwriting (although he was known to misspell even his own middle name as it was misspelled in the letter. When word of the letter's existence gained circulation, the reference to a \"Mr. Hunt\" created immediate speculation that the Hunt in questio n was either Texas oilman H. L. Hunt or, more than likely, E. Howard Hunt. In light of the then - current rumors about Hunt's alleged role in the JFK affair, coupled with his known connections to the CIA and, in particular, Mexico City, where he had been act ive during his CIA career, the suspicions about E. Howard Hunt were quite natural. It is interesting, though, that the letter was sent from Mexico City, Hunt's former base of operations. Whether the letter was real or not, it is obvious that someone wanted to throw further suspicion on E. Howard Hunt — and succeeded. That the Weberman story of \"Hunt as a tramp\" and the \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter appeared at the same time are particularly intriguing in light of another matter we are about to consider. Both the \"Hu nt as a tramp\" story and the \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter appear to be part and parcel of a CIA black propaganda operation run by the Mossad's man at the CIA, James J. Angleton. HUNT WAS IN DALLAS Ironically, as we shall see, the evidence suggests that E. Howa rd Hunt was indeed in Dallas — on, at the very least, November 21, 1963 — and very much involved in strange activities in league with key players in the JFK assassination scenario. According to Marchetti, widespread public suspicion of CIA involvement in the p resident's murder was forcing the CIA to play its hand and \"admit\" that, in fact, one of its more notorious longtime operatives, Hunt, had indeed been in Dallas on the day that Kennedy was killed. Obviously, Hunt — with his well - known ties to the anti - Castro Cubans, often considered prime suspects in the JFK assassination — would have a difficult time explaining why he had been in Big D on that fateful day — if indeed he had been. Interesting, Marchetti's article never said that Hunt had, in fact, been involved i n the assassination conspiracy. Marchetti's article said only that top - ranking CIA officials had decided to frame Hunt for the crime. Hunt, according to Marchetti's sources, was deemed expendable. M a r c h e t t i ' s a r t i c l e r e p o r t e d t h a t a s t r a n g e i n - h o u s e C I A me mo — allegedly written some years previously — had somehow ended up in the hands of investigators for the House Assassinations Committee and that Hunt, as a consequence, would ultimately be forced to explain his reported presence in Dallas (as described in the memo) on November 22, 1963."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"[212] Final Judgment 273 The editors of The Spotlight felt Marchetti's article served, if anything, as an advance warning to Hunt of what his former employers had in mind. The Spotlight's editors didn't, in fact, feel that the article implicated Hunt in the president's murder. Inexplicably, however, the ex - CIA man decided to sue, even though he ultimately admitted under oath that when he first read The Spotlight's story that Marchetti's contentions seemed plausible indeed. In short, that Hunt did belie ve that his former colleagues would be willing to throw him to the wolves — for their own nefarious reasons. Hunt's lawsuit against The Spotlight did go to trial. However, The Spotlight's management did not take the lawsuit seriously. They did not believe ei ther that the article damaged Hunt's reputation or that Hunt's attorneys could prove that the newspaper had published the article maliciously. (In fact, The Spotlight had invited Hunt to visit the newspaper's editorial offices for an interview to rebut the claims made in Marchetti's article or to even write an article rebutting Marchetti's article.) During that trial, The Spotlight's attorney unexpectedly stipulated that the newspaper did not believe that Hunt had been in Dallas on November 22, 1963 . The tr ial, however, resulted in a massive $650,000 libel judgment against the newspaper. The Spotlight appealed the judgment and the appeals court granted a new trial on the basis that the trial judge's instructions to the jury had been faulty . LANE ENTERS THE CASE It was at this point that famed JFK assassination investigator Mark Lane, an attorney, entered into the case — almost purely by chance, having been introduced to the publisher of The Spotlight by a mutual acquaintance shortly before the case was heard on appeal. Based upon his own decades of intensive research, Lane had long been convinced that the CIA had been instrumental in orchestrating the JFK assassination, but he had never had a legal forum in which to conduct an investigation of this sort. The new trial — which took place in 1985 (some seven years after the controversial article had first been published) gave him that opportunity. Lane launched The Spotlight's defense with a very different approach. He contended that Hunt had indeed been in Dallas just prior to the president's murder and that he would be able to prove it. This took Hunt's lawyers by surprise, to say the least, but despite their efforts to derail Lane's new approach, they were unsuccessful. The key witness in the second libel trial (conducted in Miami) was Marita Lorenz, a former CIA operative who had testified before the House Assassinations Committee in 1978 , relating what information she had in connection with the president's assassination. Yet, despite the inflammatory nature of what Miss Lorenz had told the committee, her testimony was discounted by the House Committee director"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"274 D ouble Cross in Dallas? [213] G. Robert Blakey (about whose own connections with the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate we learned in Chapter 10). Miss Lorenz, a Germa n - born beauty, had, in fact, been the one - time mistress of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, but she had ultimately turned on the Cuban leader and had become involved in anti - Castro activities under the CIA's tutelage. Among her key contacts in the CIA during t his period was the CIA's chief liaison with the anti - Castro Cuban operatives, E. Howard Hunt, as well as veteran CIA contract agent Frank Sturgis who essentially functioned as her handler. Mark Lane asked Miss Lorenz to testify in the Hunt trial in The Spo tlight's defense, restating — again under oath — what she had told the House Assassinations Committee and what she had told Lane himself years previously. HUNT & RUBY IN DALLAS So it was that during the Hunt libel trial, Miss Lorenz testified in a deposition that just one day prior to Kennedy's assassination, she, along with Sturgis and several anti - Castro Cuban exiles, met in Dallas with not only E. Howard Hunt, but also nightclub operator Jack Ruby who later killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the president's alleged assassin. According to Miss Lorenz, Hunt was the CIA paymaster for a top - secret operation, the purpose of which she did not know. Miss Lorenz said that she had been told by Sturgis that she was to serve as a \"decoy.\" However, feeling uneasy, Miss Lorenz l eft Dallas on November 22 and never participated in the operation. It was later she learned that President Kennedy had been assassinated and that, of course Jack Ruby had killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the president's alleged assassin. 589 As for Hunt himself, his contradictory stories about where he was situated both the day before the Kennedy assassination and the day of the assassination itself were suspicious. Lane took excellent advantage of Hunt's sworn statements (in deposition and during the two trials, as well as several other forums) to show those contradictions. These contradictions alone could have spelled Hunt's courtroom demise. What's more, the witnesses called in Hunt's defense by the ex - CIA man's attorneys only ended up suggesting Hunt had more t o hide than he had to admit. Many of these witnesses, in fact, were an assortment of Hunt's former CIA colleagues, a number of whom were represented during their testimony in deposition by CIA - dispatched lawyers. However, it was the testimony of Marita Lor enz that convinced the jury, once and for all, that The Spotlight (and Lane himself) had a much more plausible story than Hunt. Thus, the stunning courtroom victory for The Spotlight, vanquishing Hunt's libel action. Leslie Armstrong, a Miami resident who was jury forewoman in the case, issued a statement in conjunction with the release of Lane's written account of the trial: \"Mr. Lane was asking us [the jury] to do something very difficult. He was asking us to believe John Kennedy had been killed by our ow n"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"[214] Final Judgment 275 government. Yet when we examined the evidence closely, we were compelled to conclude that the CIA had indeed killed President Kennedy.\" 590 Despite this stunning conclusion, the media remained silent. Very little about Hunt's courtroom defeat appeared i n the media, particularly the sum and substance of Miss Lorenz's amazing allegations. This, of course, was real news in every sense but the media chose to ignore what had taken place in that Miami courtroom. Interestingly, however, as we shall see, there w as yet another newspaper report (similar in content to that of Victor Marchetti's disputed article) which — like Marchetti's — suggests that there was a lot more to the story than meets the eye. THE ANGLETON CONNECTION In fact, the in - house CIA memorandum li nking Hunt to the JFK assassination was the work of Israel's ally at the CIA, James Jesus Angleton, whose own history we examined in Chapter 8 and whom we have met repeatedly throughout these pages. This is not to suggest, though, that Hunt was not in Dall as on either November 21 or November 22, 1963. On the contrary, the evidence we are about to relate suggests that Hunt's presence in Dallas — for whatever purpose — was indeed linked in some fashion to the circumstances surrounding the JFK assassination conspi racy. This evidence suggests, as we shall see, that it was Angleton — who was also responsible for leaking the memo he drafted that linked Hunt to the JFK assassination. Before proceeding further with our exploration of Angleton's deeds and misdeeds, particu larly in relation to Hunt, it is important to review Victor Marchetti's article (printed in The Spotlight on August 14, 1978) which is published here in pertinent part: A few months ago, in March, there was a meeting at CIA h e a d q ua rt e r s i n L a ng l ey , Va . , t h e p l u s h ho me o f A me r i c a ' s super spo o ks o v erlo o king t he Po t o ma c Riv er.

[217] Marchetti's article is very interesting in many respects. First of all, as noted previously, Hunt himself initially admitted that he believed that the story had a basis in truth — that it was plausible, that indeed his former colleagues in the CIA did consider framing him for involvement in the JFK assassination. The origin of the memorandum linking Hunt to the JFK assassination is interesting as it is presented by Marchetti. He describes it as a memorandum that “the agency just happened to stumble across in its old files.\" In other words, one might presume from Marchetti's flippant reference, the CIA had, instead, perhaps concocted the memo. That the agency \"just happened to stumble across\" the memo at a time when pu blic suspicion of CIA involvement in the JFK assassination was growing is, of course, interesting, to say the least. If Hunt were indeed in Dallas either on the day JFK was killed — or even the day prior — it would look suspicious. Hunt's long - standing involve ment with anti - Castro Cubans through the aegis of his CIA activities — would make Hunt a likely suspect were he, in fact, proved to have been in Dallas at the critical time. As Marchetti points out, linking Hunt to the JFK assassination would be a cover stor y that the public would easily accept. The CIA, as an institution, would absolve itself of any responsibility, having thrown Hunt to the wolves as an independent operator out of the CIA's control. Indeed, the CIA could then lay claim to having \"solved\" the JFK assassination at last. Hunt's alleged involvement would also draw in a number of other false flags — not only the anti - Castro Cubans, but also \"right wingers\" in general. What's more, considering Hunt's involvement in Watergate (and with Richard Nixon h aving left the presidency in shame), Nixon himself may have taken some of the heat with many of the public suspecting the very worst — that perhaps Nixon might have had a hand in arranging the JFK assassination. Not only had Nixon been involved in the earlie st high - level anti - Castro planning, alongside Hunt and the CIA, but Nixon himself had been vanquished in the 1960 presidential campaign by Kennedy. That one of Nixon's Watergate burglars was being implicated in the JFK assassination would do no service to Nixon's already tarnished image. Marchetti also pointed out that \"The fact that some [of Hunt's to - be - alleged co - conspirators] may have had connections with organized crime will prove to be only incidental in the long run.\" This \"limited hangout\" by the C IA would have, as a consequence, covered up the role of the Israeli - linked Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. To delve too deeply into the real origins and linkage of the crime network would have dragged the Israeli connection into the open — if pursued to its logical conclusion. Now, obviously, the scenario presented in Marchetti's article — the framing of Hunt by the CIA — never, in fact, took place. That it had a basis in truth — that Hunt was being pondered as a \"fall guy\" — however, seems apparent."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"[218] Final Judgment 279 This is supported by the fact that a similar article, based on relatively the same fact situation, appeared during the same period in another newspaper.

First of all, one of the co - authors, Joseph Trento, admitted under oath during the E. Howard Hunt - Spotlight libel trial that he had actually seen the controversial memo in question. Trento also noted that he knew James Jesus Angleton of the CIA and had utilized him as a source on occasion. In fact, we know, as a consequence of the Hunt libel case against The Spo tlight that intelligence writer, William R. Corson — a longtime Angleton asset in the media — was actually the immediate source of both the Marchetti and Trento stories. Corson was obviously working as Angleton's \"cutout\" passing on the information that appear ed in the two stories. (And it's probably no accident that one of Corson's associates, in later years before Corson died, engaged in a longtime and determined covert effort to undermine the distribution of Final Judgment and to personally destroy this writ er, but to also undermine Mark Lane, whose courtroom victory over Hunt [and effectively over Angleton and Corson] left the intelligence community reeling. But that's another story for another time — but significant still indeed.) That Angleton was the author of the memo addressed to his CIA superior (and longtime patron) Richard Helms is also of interest, considering Angleton's close working relationship with Israel's Mossad (documented in Chapter 8). While the Trento story claims that the CIA memo was ostens ibly drafted in 1966, the actual date the memo first appeared is subject, of course, to question, as is the actual intent of the memo itself. The article itself notes that a \"high - level CIA source\" considered the memo to be \"very odd\" in that it recorded — i n writing — the alleged presence in Dallas of longtime CIA operative, Hunt, at the time of JFK's murder. The evidence suggests that the reason why Angleton's memo was put on paper — and then subsequently released — was that Angleton wanted the story to be leaked to the press — as part of a continuing cover - up of the real origins of the JFK assassination. Hunt — a lower level CIA operative (already tarnished by Watergate) — was being hung out to dry and the real conspirators at the top were washing their hands of the ma tter. WAS THE MEMO LEAKED DELIBERATELY? Did Angleton and Helms really worry, as the article suggests, that the agency would be damaged by the revelations, or did they, instead, arrange for the memo to be leaked so that there would be, as Victor Marchetti 's aforementioned article suggested, a \"limited hangout\" which would absolve the CIA as an institution of any involvement in the crime? Joe Trento has subsequently revealed that Angleton did in fact leak the memo to the House Assassinations Committee. Howe ver, according to Trento, ''It was all handled in such a way that Angleton was not the source. ”593"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"282 Double Cross in Dallas? [221] That the Trento article suggests that Hunt was in fact in Dallas and that he was there on an assignment involving Lee Harvey Oswald is significant as well. WAS HUNT ORDERED TO DALLAS? Could it be that Hunt had somehow been manipulated into involvement in the JFK assassination conspiracy, not knowing that there were bigger and more insidious things going on in the strange world of Lee Harvey Oswald? Was Hunt indeed sent to Dallas on a CIA - sponsored pretext, orchestrated by one of his superiors — namely James Jesus Angleton — only to discover, after the fact, that the assassination of John F. Kennedy was in the works? According to Trento, Angleton told him that Hu nt had been sent to Dallas by a high - level Soviet KGB mole working in the CIA. However, says Trento, \"I later came to conclude that the mole - sent - Hunt idea was, to use his phrase, disinformation; that Angleton was trying to protect his own connections to H unt's being in Dallas . . . My guess is, it was Angleton himself who sent Hunt to Dallas, because he didn't want to use anybody from his own shop.\" 594 All of this is interesting, to say the least, and pinpoints Angleton as a key player in the events linkin g the CIA and Hunt to Dallas. Yet, as we shall see, there is much more to the story of the role played by the CIA's Mossad ally James J. Angleton in the JFK assassination and cover - up. In fact, Angleton had a hand in the very part of the assassination cons piracy that involved the frame - up of Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator\" guilty of associating with the Soviet KGB. THE CIA & THE MEXICO CITY SCENARIO The Trento article accepts, as its basis, the story that Lee Harvey Oswald had been in Mexico City meeting with the Soviets and the Castro Cubans. However, as Mark Lane demonstrated in Plausible Denial, the story that Oswald had been in Mexico City meeting with the communists was an outright fraud — a concoction of the CIA itself. Lane summarized the situation: \"At the outset it should be understood that almost all of the information regarding Oswald's alleged visit to Mexico and his contact with the Soviets and Cubans while there had been fabricated by the Central Intelligence Agency. In its report, the [Warren] commission cited the CIA as the primary source for the Mexico City scenario, declining to seek independent corroboration for the CIA's version of events. \"Nevertheless, the Mexico City scenario constitutes the conventional wisdom as promulgate d by the CIA and accepted by the Warren Commission. It remains an article of faith for those who subsequently endorsed the Warren Report, including journalists and official investigating"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"[222] Final Judgment 283 committees. One of the central tenets of the lone assassin theory is Lee Harvey Oswald's presence in Mexico City. \"Soon after the commission was created, the CIA informed Earl Warren that Oswald had been in Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963 and that he had spent most of that time in Mexico City. \"According to the CIA, Oswald had visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on September 27 and the Soviet Embassy on October 1. Proof that Oswald had been in the Cuban Embassy, the CIA reported, came from Senora Silvia Duran, a Mexican employed at the Cuban Embassy. Proof that Oswald had been to the Soviet Embassy, the CIA claimed, came from the observations of its own agents.\" 595 OSWALD AND THE KGB? The CIA told the Warren Commission that Oswald had met with a Soviet KGB officer named Valeriy Kostikov who was a specialis t in assassination and sabotage; that Kostikov was in charge of Soviet - orchestrated assassinations in the United States. Clearly, the CIA's implication was that Oswald had been meeting with the KGB officer to plan JFK's murder. However, even the Warren Com mission was suspicious and asked for evidence of Oswald's activities in Mexico City. Some four months went by before the CIA could provide anything other than the testimony of the aforementioned Miss Duran. Yet, as the evidence shows, Miss Duran only ident ified Oswald as a visitor to the Cuban Embassy after she had been arrested by the Mexican police at the direction (unknown to her) of the CIA. She was forced into making the statement that the CIA wanted: that Oswald had been to the Cuban Embassy. After sh e was released from custody, she spoke out about her experience and the CIA cabled the Mexican police to re - arrest the young lady, but cautioned the police to make sure that Miss Duran knew nothing about the CIA's involvement in her imbroglio. Finally, und er pressure to provide further corroboration of Oswald's activities, the CIA managed to come up with recordings of a telephone conversation between someone alleged to be Lee Harvey Oswald and someone at the Soviet Embassy. However, even the FBI, having rev iewed the recording, concluded that its agents were of the opinion, that it \"was NOT Lee Harvey Oswald.\" 596 Despite this provocative conclusion, the FBI report never reached the Warren Commission. Warren and company had only to rely upon the reports from t he CIA. (The FBI report only became public some years later when Mark Lane obtained it through the Freedom of Information Act.) In 1977 David Atlee Phillips, former head of the Western Hemisphere for the CIA, admitted publicly that Oswald had not been to t he Soviet Embassy in Mexico City."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"284 Double Cross in Dallas? [223] Phillips, if anybody, should have known inasmuch as he had been CIA station chief in Mexico City at the time of Oswald's alleged visit. (There have been allegations also, incidentally, that Oswald may have been spotted i n Dallas with a CIA operative known as \"Maurice Bishop\" whom many believe, in fact, was Phillips.) In a rather fierce debate with Mark Lane at the University of Southern California, a somewhat distressed Phillips confessed: \"I am not in a position today to talk to you about the inner workings of the CIA station in Mexico City . . . but I will tell you this, that when the record comes out, we will find that there . . . is no evidence to show that Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy.\" 597 WARREN 'HEL D HOSTAGE' According to Mark Lane: The magnitude of this CIA misconduct can be fully understood only when its conspiracy to cover up is traced to its origin. For the CIA charade, which evidently included employing an imposter for Oswald, began no later th an October 1, 1963. \"One month and twenty - two days before President Kennedy was assassinated, the CIA had set into motion a series of events apparently designed to prevent any American institution from ever daring to learn the truth about the assassination , an assassination that had not yet taken place. \"More than seven weeks before President Kennedy was murdered, the CIA was dramatically and falsely establishing a link between Lee Harvey Oswald and a Soviet diplomat, whom the CIA would later designate as t he KGB authority on assassinations in the United States.\" 598 As a consequence, the Warren Commission, confronted by the CIA with what appeared to be possible Soviet involvement in the Kennedy assassination, moved to suppress what it mistakenly believed to be \"the truth.\" The fate of the world was in the hands of Chief Justice Earl Warren and his fellow commission members. If the public learned that Oswald was a pawn of the Soviets, a nuclear war could break out. As Mark Lane commented, Warren was \"held hos tage\" 599 by the CIA's provocative lie. During his debate with David Atlee Phillips, Mark Lane exposed all of this before the audience. When confronted and following his confession that Oswald had not been at the Soviet Embassy, Phillips suggested essential ly that he didn't want either the CIA or himself to be held responsible for \"some CIA guy that I never saw [who] did something that I never heard of.” 600 Now while Phillips was being disingenuous at best, the fact is that it was indeed someone whom he cer tainly knew who was behind the Mexico City scenario. It was none other than his CIA colleague, James J. Angleton. ANGLETON & MEXICO CITY"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"[224] Final Judgment 285 Assassination researcher Bernard Fensterwald reported in 1977 that, \"Angleton had handled several controversial CIA matters relating to the assassination, such as the mysterious series of CIA photographs taken in Mexico City in September and October, 1963, in which a man identified by the CIA as Lee Harvey Oswald turned out not to be Oswald at all.\" 601 What's more , as pointed out by Peter Dale Scott, a report by the House Assassinations Committee \"established that, on the death of Win Scott, the by - then retired Mexico City station chief who had sent out the Kostikov cable, CIA counterintelligence chief Angleton fle w immediately to Mexico City, retrieved a photograph of 'Oswald' from the family safe, and destroyed it . . . .” 602 What is particularly interesting, in light of all that we have seen in relation to Angleton's ties to the Mossad, Scott adds further: \"A ngleton may have undertaken this mission on behalf of the agency. Another possibility is that he undertook it on behalf of a cabal within the government who had conspired to create the `Oswald' - Kostikov story. \" 603 The Mexico City - Oswald scenario was clear ly part of the groundwork for the ultimate framing of Lee Harvey Oswald as a communist sympathizer — perhaps even a KGB operative — who had killed the American president. And in light of the mysterious appearance of the \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter (ostensibly from Lee Harvey Oswald) mailed from Mexico City, we can only speculate as to whether Angleton himself may have been the mastermind behind the leak of that hitherto unknown document as well. Was the \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter also part of Angleton's tangled web of i ntrigue? It was Angleton who was so determined to bury any evidence that proved that Oswald was not, in fact, a KGB operative (as we have already seen in Chapter 8.) It was Angleton who most vociferously accused Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko of being a KGB plant. Nosenko had come to the United States following the JFK assassination and claimed insistently that Oswald had not worked for the Soviet KGB, that the KGB had vetoed any idea of attempting to recruit Oswald after the young American had \"defected\" to the USSR (whether Oswald's \"defection\" was genuine or not). The story told by Nosenko disproved Angleton's thesis entirely — which perhaps explains why Angleton dealt so harshly with Nosenko. That Trento's story — leaking the Angleton memo on Hunt — would incorp orate a major portion of Angleton's JFK cover story is interesting, to say the least. WHAT MOTIVATED ANGLETON? Pointing toward the intra - CIA turmoil which, in fact, had resulted in Angleton's ouster from the CIA, is the interesting suggestion in Trento's story that sources within the CIA had suggested that Angleton was suspected by some of being a KGB mole."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"286 Double Cross in Dallas? [225] This, of course, is part of the great irony of Angleton's complex life in that it was Angleton who was the prime mover behind long - term internal CIA inquiries into possible infiltration of the agency at the highest levels. However, Angleton's fiercest critics, as we have seen, have suggested that Angleton was indeed a mole — but not for the Soviets; that instead, Angleton was a full - fledged co - opted agen t for Israel. In the context in which we have examined Angleton's role in the CIA, working for — Israel and its Mossad, this appears to be the real driving force behind Angleton's dealings insofar as the JFK assassination was concerned. That Trento's story n otes Angleton's interest in the Warren Commission investigation only displays part of the picture, however. JFK assassination investigator Bernard Fensterwald detailed how very much interested Angleton was in the JFK assassination. \"The extent of Angleton' s involvement in the CIA's end of the assassination investigation first became underscored in 1974, when Senator Howard Baker (R - Tenn.) released some information that he had originally secured while serving on the Senate Watergate Committee. \"Senator Baker disclosed that he had come across at least two CIA `dossiers' indicating that the Agency may have been involved in domestic affairs. He disclosed that one of these CIA files, on Warren Commission critic Bernard Fensterwald, Jr., contained copies of severa l high - level internal CIA memos which clearly showed that James Angleton was the key CIA official in dealing with matters related to the Kennedy assassination. \"In a memo dated January 13, 1969 to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Angleton noted that Fensterwa ld was setting up a Washington - based Committee to Investigate Assassinations. In this confidential memo, Angleton . . . went on to request that Hoover run some kind of vaguely defined identification check on Fensterwald and three other Warren Commission cr itics associated with him. In June, 1976, new information became available regarding Angleton's key role in dealing with the Warren Commission investigation. \"The Senate Intelligence Committee reported that at a meeting in late December of 1963, Angleton h ad requested that he be allowed to take over CIA responsibility for dealing with the Warren Commission probe. \"The Senate Committee's Final Report noted that, 'Angleton suggested that his own Counterintelligence Division take over the investigation and [Ri chard] Helms acceded to this suggestion.' Thereafter, Angleton's staff became responsible for all CIA dealings with the Commission.” 604 So it was that Israel's chief advocate at the CIA became that agency's number one in - house handler for JFK assassinatio n investigation — some would call it a \"cover - up\" — during the Warren Commission's controversial inquiry into the president's murder. What's more, Angleton's close friend (and FBI source), William Sullivan, number three man at the FBI, was detailed as the FBI' s liaison with the Warren Commission. (In Chapter 17 we shall learn more about how another prominent friend of Israel helped shape Chief Justice Earl Warren's views about the JFK"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"[226] Final Judgment 287 assassination — pointing the finger, like Angleton, in the direction of the co mmunists.\") THE M URDERED M ISTRESS Angleton's interest in the affairs of John F. Kennedy were evidently broad - ranging. For example, The Washington Post reported on February 23, 1976 that after Washington socialite Mary Pinchot Meyer was shot to death (in what was said to be a robbery) on October 12, 1964, it was Angleton who obtained Mrs. Meyer's diary and destroyed it at CIA headquarters. Mrs. Meyer, in fact, had been a longtime lover of President Kennedy's — one of many, apparently, and her diary contained much information about her relationship with the president. It was her sister, Toni Bradlee, wife of Post editor Ben Bradlee (himself a reported former CIA asset) who provided Angleton Mrs. Meyer's diary for his disposal. 605 What the diary contained is a nyone's guess, but it does suggest that Angleton was very much involved in intrigue involving the late president. There have been those who have speculated that the diary may have contained secrets about the CIA - Organized Crime plots to assassinate Castro that JFK may have told Mrs. Meyer about. However, of course, it is just as easy to speculate that perhaps the diary also contained Mrs. Meyer's written memories of President Kennedy's musings about his most unpleasant relationship with the state of Israel. Angleton's own relationship with Hunt is also quite mysterious to say the least. If indeed Angleton did sign off on a 1966 memo pinpointing Hunt as having been in Dallas, the CIA's shadowy counterintelligence chief seemed to have forgotten by 1972 at the time of the Watergate break - in. WHAT DID HE KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT? According to investigative reporter Jim Hougan, Angleton, on June 19, 1972 denied ever having seen Hunt, following revelations that Hunt had been involved in the Watergate burglary . Hougan quotes Angleton as having said, \"I'd never seen [Hunt] before in my life.\" 606 This suggests that Angleton was proclaiming ignorance of Hunt's existence, although this, of course, is highly unlikely, especially since we now know of the existence o f the memo from Angleton which was evidently drafted in 1966 — six years before the Watergate affair. Or, logically, we could also suggest that the memorandum itself was not, in fact, drafted in 1966 as we have been told. It could, instead, have been drafted at a much later time and then given the earlier date. What's more, of course, Angleton was knee - deep in the Bay of Pigs invasion planning and it is inconceivable that he would not be aware of the existence of Hunt, the chief political liaison to the anti - Castro Cuban exiles involved in that operation. Whichever the case, it strongly suggests that there was a lot more to the Angleton - Hunt relationship than meets the eye."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"288 Double Cross in Dallas? [227] A N G L E T O N , H U N T & T H E J F K A S S A S S I N A T I O N What we can glean from all of that which we h ave considered thus far is this:   That it was James Jesus Angleton, Israel's ally at the CIA, who was particularly interested — from the very beginning — in overseeing any investigation of the CIA's links to the JFK assassination.   That Angleton's interest in th e furor over the JFK assassination was long - standing and continued well into the years beyond the Warren Commission investigation.   That Hunt was, in some way, connected to events linked to the assassination and that he was, in fact, in Dallas — if not on the day of the murder, at least one day prior.   That when public attention began focusing on the CIA's presumed complicity in the president's murder (during the period of the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation), a memo (written by Angleton and linking Hunt to the JFK murder) was leaked by Angleton to the House Assassinations Committee.   That Angleton's relationship with Hunt was murky, to say the least, and subject to some suspicion.   That Victor Marchetti's disputed article (subject of E. How ard Hunt's libel suit) was acknowledged by Hunt himself to have some apparent plausibility.   That despite his admission that Marchetti's article might have a basis in truth, Hunt did not choose to challenge his former colleagues in the CIA who may have been intent on implicating him in the assassination conspiracy.   That Joe Trento's similar article shed unusual light on internal CIA intrigue involving Lee Harvey Oswald, E. Howard Hunt and the circumstances surrounding the JFK assassination.   That Hunt insiste d that he was not guilty of complicity in the president's murder and chose to use a libel suit against The Spotlight to prove his innocence, however unsuccessful he may have been.   That when Hunt prepared his case against The Spotlight he turned to the CIA for help, which kindly supplied no less than Newton Miler, Angleton's longtime deputy, generally characterized as an \"Angleton loyalist,\" 607 as the chief witness called in Hunt's defense. 608 This final point is interesting, especially in light of Hunt's in itial suspicion that the CIA intended to frame him as he admitted in testimony. Could it be that somehow Hunt and his CIA colleagues reached a private accord following the publication of The Spotlight article by Victor Marchetti — the publication of which, i n effect, frustrated the until - then secret, internal CIA plot against Hunt? Could it be that both Hunt and the CIA determined that, whatever really happened in Dallas involving Hunt, Oswald and any other CIA - connected figures, was better left alone?"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"[228] Final Judgment 289 We ca n only speculate as to the motivation of Hunt and the CIA in this regard. What we do know, however, is that it was Israel's friend at the CIA, the enigmatic James Jesus Angleton, who was the prime mover behind the memorandum that would have been used to fr ame Hunt for involvement in the assassination. Was Angleton simply looking out for the interests of the CIA? Or was he also looking out for his own interests? And if so, what were those interests? What did Angleton know about the JFK assassination? Angleto n sent E. Howard Hunt to Dallas just prior to the assassination. What was Angleton's purpose in doing so? And why was Angleton involved in the sensitive, top - secret CIA Mexico City intrigue which took place over a month prior to the JFK assassination, link ing Lee Harvey Oswald to the Soviets and Castro's Cuba? Angleton's link to Israel and its Mossad is the key to understanding Angleton's unusual behavior that we have outlined. The Mossad loyalist, James J. Angleton, was the central player in the intrigue b etween the CIA and the Mossad in the JFK assassination. Never - before - published information that we will be reviewing later in this chapter confirms our contention that Angleton was indeed the primary high - level CIA collaborator in the JFK assassination con spiracy. Angleton was the CIA figure involved with the Mossad — if not in the actual planning of the JFK assassination itself — then certainly in key aspects of the subsequent cover - up. E. Howard Hunt, indeed, may have been Angleton's fall guy — another patsy — fr om the beginning. HUNT'S SILENCE What role did E. Howard Hunt play in Angleton's game of intrigue? Hunt himself is not saying. He has, instead, chosen to deny any responsibility or involvement — for whatever reasons — and bitterly contests any suggestions of his connection to the events in Dallas. Perhaps he does so for several reasons. One reason may be that Hunt — like many of his colleagues in the CIA — did not necessarily regret the assassination of JFK. Hunt was bitter toward Kennedy for the president's move s against the CIA and Hunt himself probably felt then (as perhaps he does today) that Kennedy was getting a taste of his own medicine. What's more — and perhaps most importantly, in a personal sense for Hunt — the ex - CIA man cannot fail to note that many of th e key JFK assassination witnesses over the years have met early — and violent — deaths. And like all people Hunt wants to live. Whatever Hunt does know, we will probably never find out — and Hunt intends to keep it that way. In the February 1, 1992 edition of hi s newsletter, New American View, a monthly critique of the Israeli lobby and its power in America, Marchetti recently commented on the renewed furor over the JFK assassination. Marchetti's words speak for themselves:"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"290 Double Cross in Dallas? [229] \"As for my personal views on the CIA's involvement in JFK's assassination, I do not (repeat do not) believe that the CIA had anything to do with the young president's murder. \"But it was and still is involved with the government's cover - up of the conspiracy . . . \"Finally, E. Howard Hunt had n othing to do with JFK's assassination. Hunt was in Dallas that day by accident. He was working on another case. But his presence there was an embarrassment to the CIA and a potential threat to the government's cover - up of the conspiracy.\" 609 Marchetti's e arlier controversial article in The Spotlight, as we have pointed out, never suggested that Hunt had actually been in Dallas or that he played a part in the assassination — only that the CIA was considering the option of framing Hunt for the president's murd er. And, as we have seen, it was Israel's contact at the CIA, James J. Angleton who was behind the impending operation against Hunt. However, Marchetti's final comment about Hunt's possible appearance in Dallas is interesting, particularly in light of what we are about to consider. WAS HUNT A FALL GUY? There is evidence that Hunt, in fact, may have been inadvertently caught up in intrigue involving the JFK assassination conspiracy — intrigue beyond his own control. There have been suggestions that perhaps H unt was not actively involved in a genuine assassination plot against Kennedy — as indeed as suggested in Trento's aforementioned article — and that he was in Dallas for another purpose entirely. Our source for this little - known information is Gary Wean, forme rly of the Los Angeles Police Department's criminal intelligence squad. It was in Chapter 13 that we first became acquainted with Wean who detailed his own dealings and surveillance of Meyer Lansky's Hollywood henchman, Mickey Cohen. (Wean, it will be reca lled, learned that Cohen, along with his Israeli contact, Menachem Begin, later prime minister of Israel, was especially concerned with JFK's Middle East policy and that, in fact, Cohen was using JFK's mistress, actress Marilyn Monroe, as a conduit in an a ttempt to learn the president's intentions toward Israel.) THE COP, THE MOVIE STAR & THE SHERIFF It was shortly after the JFK assassination that Wean stumbled upon information relating to the president's murder — information that sheds new — and interesting — light on how E. Howard Hunt may have come to be implicated in the crime of the century. According to Wean, it was just several weeks after the president's murder that he (Wean) happened to become acquainted with Dallas Sheriff Bill Decker through their mut ual friend, Audie Murphy, the ex - war hero - turned - film star. Decker was visiting in Los Angeles and the three men got"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"[230] Final Judgment 291 together along with another friend of Wean's and the talk turned to the JFK assassination. (Decker, it might be noted, appears to be one D allas law enforcement official who is definitely in the clear as far as any involvement in the assassination is concerned. It was Decker, in fact, who had ordered his men to investigate the railroad yard behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll from whe re shots at the president's motorcade appeared to have originated. 610 Were Decker a co - conspirator he certainly would not have assisted in the capture of the president's assassins.) Decker told Wean that he was certain that Lee Harvey Oswald was innocent o f the president's murder. The three gentlemen, all of whom were familiar with firearms, didn't believe that Oswald could have carried out the crime with the weapon he was alleged to have used. `A TERRIBLE DOUBLE CROSS SOMEWHERE' However, Wean reports tha t Sheriff Decker proceeded to elaborate further, saying, \"I have another reason, much stronger, for knowing Oswald never shot JFK. There's a man in Dallas I've known a longtime. He knows the entire truth about Oswald's involvement. \"He's scared to death to go to the Dallas P.D. or FBI. There has been a terrible double cross somewhere and everybody is scared shitless of everybody else. You wouldn't believe the crazy suspicions and accusations heaped on all law enforcement in the south by the imbeciles in D.C . and the chaos it has created.\" \"There was no conspiracy in my sheriff's department involving the assassination nor in the Dallas P.D. I've known all these people too long. I would have known it. Believe me, something as 'crazy' as this I'd feel it in my bones.\" 611 Wean remembered this conversation and later, during a trip to Ruidoso, New Mexico in the company of Audie Murphy, Wean was introduced to Decker's source from Dallas, whom Wean says was named \"John.\" According to Wean's source, CIA man E. Howard Hunt was indeed involved with Lee Harvey Oswald — but not in planning the president's assassination. Wean reports that John told him that Hunt had something else in mind altogether. Essentially, according to Wean's source, Hunt — like other leaders in the ant i - Castro movement — was becoming frustrated with the Kennedy' administration's moves to achieve at least an informal detente with Castro. Hunt, of course, had devoted much energy to the drive to undermine Castro and now all of his work was being undone. Wean quoted his source as describing what happened: \"Hunt's festering frustration conceived what's become the most bizarre political assassination intrigue of all time. His scheme was to inflame American people against Castro and stirring patriotism to a boili ng point not felt since Pearl Harbor. Enraged Americans would demand that our military invade Cuba wiping out"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"292 Double Cross in Dallas? [231] the two - bit dictator for his barbarous attempt to 'assassinate' President Kennedy.” 612 F O O TP RINTS TO CASTRO 'S DO O RSTEP \"There was to be an at tempt on the life of President Kennedy so `realistic' that it's failure would be looked upon as nothing less than a miracle. Footprints would lead right to Castro's doorstep, a trail that the rankest amateur could not lose. Unfortunately for Oswald he fit the bill perfect for Hunt's operation.\" 613 \"At first Hunt did not tell Oswald what his exact mission was, except it was of the highest National Security priority . . . It was only two months before the 'fake assassination' when Hunt gave Oswald the rifle, explaining his part in the plan. Oswald was to fire three shots from his rifle 'in the air.' He was to abandon it and empty cartridges at the scene and quickly leave the building for a rendezvous with agents who'd transport him to a secret destination.\" H e'd remain in hiding until after Cuba was invaded by the U.S. A fake trail to Mexico City ending at the Cuban Embassy would lead investigators to think he'd fled to Cuba, the belief that 'Castro planned the assassination' of President Kennedy [which failed ] and [that] the [attempted] 'assassin' was being harbored under [Castro's] protection in Cuba would stir the Americans to a feverish pitch of anger . . .\" 6 14 According to Wean's source, Hunt told Oswald that President Kennedy himself was not aware of the plan, but high - ranking cabinet officers were in on the deal. Oswald would be free to come back and live as a free man after Castro was dealt with. 615 Wean was also told that the famous \"attempted assassination\" of General Edwin Walker, the outspoken anti - Castro leader in Dallas, was also part of the plan to establish a pattern of violent activity by a suspected \"pro - Castro activist.\" 616 However, Wean reports, John told him that in the course of the planning for the fraudulent assassination attempt, some thing went wrong — there was interference from outside — from a power beyond E. Howard Hunt's immediate influence. John noted: \"Of course, all covert operations have inherent dangers and are subject to break - downs. By my God, this was no break - down or neglect of performance, or even bad luck. What happened is incomprehensible. \" 6 17 In short, according to the source in Dallas, Hunt's plan backfired. Shots were actually fired at JFK's motorcade and the president was indeed killed. However, John did not believe t hat the blame lay at the hands of either the Mafia or the anti - Castro Cubans. He believed that another force had intervened. \"It can't be that the Mafia or Cuban exiles [did] it,\" noted John. \"They had no motive, as they'd already been given inside tips an operation was underway that would return them to Cuba. It would have been totally stupid for them to interfere . . ."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"[232] Final Judgment 293 According to John: \"Only a few of Hunt's most trusted men knew all of his plans down to the last detail. It is impossible to believe any of them is a traitor. Still it's clear, whoever shot Kennedy had to know all these minute details to pull it off the way they did. Something frightening, horribly sinister had interposed Hunt's mission.\" 618 Wean and Audie Murphy listened in shock at what t hey had been told and, at the time, John gave Murphy a packet of what he described as evidence which backed up his story. However, it was just several days later that John asked that they forget what they had been told. According to Wean, Murphy informed h im that he had been advised from Dallas that \"Hunt and his agents have regrouped from their horrified panic and sprung back into action. Hunt's machinations and connection with Oswald had to be covered up at all costs.\" According to Murphy, military intell igence, the FBI and the CIA were all in a panic. \"If their secrets were to be exposed they'd be rooted out in an eruption of calamitous national anger. In their nightmares all they can see is a firing squad. In fact they have solemnly determined that natio nal security is at stake. That's their justification for a cover - up.\" 619 To assuage the fears of John in Dallas, he assured John that the documents he had received from him had been destroyed. Murphy himself may well be one other on the long list of addit ional victims of the JFK assassination conspiracy. The actor died in a plane crash in 1971. Gary Wean, however, has lived to tell the story of what he was told. Quite accurately, Wean himself has described how Hunt and Oswald both must have reacted if the story that John told Wean and Murphy was indeed true. `A DOUBLE CROSS OF FANTASTIC DIMENSIONS'? According to Wean's assessment of what may have then happened, \"Hunt and Oswald salvaging their senses from the paralyzing shock of Kennedy being murdered mos t certainly had identical thoughts: 'I have been framed.' \"A double - cross of fantastic dimensions. The consequences were too devastating, and terrifying to grasp. It was the end for them. Regardless of Hunt's convictions that his closest men were beyond su spicion, one of them was a spy — a mole in deep, deep cover.\" 620 It is up to E. Howard Hunt to provide us the missing pieces of the puzzle. It does not seem likely that he will. JOHN'S IDENTITY? There is additional documentation about the activities of an individual named \"John\" who was active in the Dallas area and in Miami (Hunt's base of operations with the anti - Castro Cuban exiles) immediately before and after the JFK assassination."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"294 Double Cross in Dallas? [233] In his book Conspiracy, Anthony Summers describes one John Martino wh o was known to have connections to both the Mafia, Meyer Lansky's lieutenant, Santo Trafficante, Jr., in particular, and the Central Intelligence Agency. In fact, Martino admitted in 1975 that he had been a CIA contract agent and that he had inside knowled ge about the circumstances surrounding the JFK assassination. Summers quotes Martino as having said, \"The anti - Castro people put Oswald together. Oswald didn't know who he was working for — he was just ignorant of who was really putting him together.\" 621 Af ter Martino died in 1978, Summers notes, his widow claimed that \"the Company\" (i.e. the CIA) picked up his body to determine the cause of death, which was established to have been a heart attack. 622 Martino and film star Audie Murphy unquestionably had at least one connection, indirect, at the least, that can be documented. Murphy was employed for a period during the mid - 1960s by New Orleans businessman, D'Alton Smith. 623 Smith was an intimate personal associate of Meyer Lansky's Louisiana front man, Carlo s Marcello. The story told by John Martino, at the very least, has a ring similar to the story told by the \"John\" whom Gary Wean met in Dallas. However, shortly before Final Judgment went to press, Wean revealed to this author the identity of the gentleman named John who told him what had really happened in Dallas. According to Wean when he wrote his book describing his meeting with John, he deliberately did not reveal John's last name, although he knew exactly who John was. What's more, according to Wean, he slightly altered his physical description of John in order to protect his identity. At the time Wean's book was written, John was alive. However, on April 5, 1991 John died, like Audie Murphy, in a bizarre airplane explosion that made national headlines . He was John Tower who, in 1961 had been the first Republican in this century to win a Senate seat from Texas. A stalwart ally of the CIA throughout his career, it was Tower who took many of the secrets of the Iran - Contra scandal to his grave, having head ed the commission which critics contend was a CIA whitewash of the events, particularly those involving Israel's role in the affair. A 'THIRD FORCE'? Veteran JFK assassination researcher, Dick Russell himself has pondered the possibility that the CIA's r elationship with Lee Harvey Oswald — whatever the nature of that relationship — was \"usurped by another group.” 624 As Russell notes, \"Many people in the CIA had reasons to cover up their own relationship to Oswald, even if this had nothing to do with an assa ssination conspiracy. In considering this plethora of possibilities . . . what cannot be overlooked is that a 'third force' was aware of the counterspy web [surrounding Oswald] and seized on it to their own advantage.\" 625"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"[234] Final Judgment 295 Russell has also pointed out th at the anti - Castro Cuban exiles now believe that there was much more going on behind the scenes than even they realized at the time. According to Russell, \"[Legendary longtime CIA contract agent] Gerry Patrick Hemming, who still keeps his ear to the ground in Miami's Little Havana, maintains that some of the exiles who thought they knew the score in 1963 have today become convinced that they were being used. \"They were incited to an anti - Kennedy fervor by being let in on the secret knowledge that Kennedy wa s seriously exploring accommodation with Castro. They were told that their dream of retaking their homeland was dead — unless something drastic was done. They took the bait. \"Should it have become necessary in the design of the behind - the - scenes planners, th e exiles were also expendable. Implicating a few Cuban refugees in the assassination was not desirable, but it would not come at a high cost, especially if . . . they had worked diligently to build a cover as Castro agents. \"Small cogs in the wheel, they c ould also be made to disappear. So Cuban exiles were merely the base of the pyramid. They had no power to initiate the cover - up that followed. And neither did organized crime.\" 626 WHO HAD THE POWER? Hemming himself has spoken of at least one faction of a nti - Castro Cuban exiles who seemed to be out of the conventional loop. According to Hemming: \"It's hard to say exactly who this select group of Cuban exiles was really working for. For a while they were reporting to Bill Harvey's ex - FBI CIA guys. Some were reporting back to [J. Edgar] Hoover, or the new [Defense Intelligence Agency]. 'There was a third force — pretty much outside CIA channels, outside our own private operation down in the [Florida] Keys — that was doing all kinds of shit, and had been all throu gh 1963. [emphasis added] \"Then after the assassination, a lot of us presumed that somewhere down the line, the KGB was orchestrating with Fidel to do the Dallas job. Not until later did we figure out that most of the exiles being approached were being set up as patsies themselves. \"And not by Castro or the Russians. It was domestic. Somebody like J. Edgar Hoover. Who else had the power?\" 627 Dare we suggest an answer to Hemming's question — \"Who else had the power?\" Obviously, the answer is this: Israel, its Mossad and Israel's powerful domestic American lobby and its contacts at all levels. In fact, there have been several widely - read works relating to the JFK assassination which have indeed suggested that Oswald, at least, was roped into some sort of \"dummy assassination\" type of operation which he was led to believe was of the nature described by Gary Wean's source in Dallas. Executive Action, the book loosely based on the film of the same name, presents Oswald as being manipulated in this fashion. Likewise with former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow's work, Betrayal, which Morrow"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"296 Double Cross in Dallas? [235] based on his own \"inside\" information from his involvement with figures involved in the conspiracy. More recently, Don DeLillo's novel, Libra, presents Oswald at the center of a \"dummy assassination\" attempt which was manipulated by others and went awry. (One CIA character in the novel bears a striking resemblance, in several ways, to E. Howard Hunt.) However, there is yet one quite extraordinary piece of the puzzle which actually implicates a known longtime Mossad asset with direct involvement in the events in Dealey Plaza. It involves the apparent role by longtime CIA contract operative Frank Sturgis in the actual assassination itself. MOSSAD OPERATIVE IN DEALEY PLAZA In the c ourse of her testimony in the case of E. Howard Hunt's libel suit against The Spotlight, CIA asset Marita Lorenz testified that Sturgis told her afterward that, \"We killed the president that day . . . Everything was covered in advance. No arrests, no real newspaper investigation. It was all covered, very professional.\" 628 Although some JFK researchers express doubts about Miss Lorenz' story, Cuba's chief of counterintelligence, General Fabian Escalante, vouches for her, based on his own extensive study of the JFK assassination. Escalante told journalist Claudia Furiati that Cuban intelligence had d e t e r m i n e d t h a t , i n f a c t , \" S t u r g i s w a s i n c h a r g e o f communications — receiving and transmitting information on the movement at Dealey Plaza and the motorcade to the shooters and others.\" 629 If we are to believe that Sturgis was, in fact, involved in the actual mechanics of the assassination, the historical evidence suggests that Sturgis could have been functioning as a knowing Mossad tool in the conspiracy, or, at th e very least, have been indirectly working on behalf of the Mossad. While this assertion will at first astound even the most seasoned reader of JFK assassination literature the following factor must be considered: What few people know is that Sturgis had t ies to Israel's Mossad, going back fifteen years prior to the JFK assassination. Writing in the July 1975 issue of Argosy magazine, F. Peter Model reported that Sturgis was a \"Hagannah mercenary during the first (1948) Israeli - Arab war,\" 630 and that Sturg is also had a girlfriend in Europe in the 1950s who worked for Israeli intelligence and with whom he worked. Sturgis himself is quoted by JFK assassination researcher A. J. Weberman as having said that he assisted his girlfriend as a courier in Europe in a number of her endeavors on behalf of the Mossad. 631 In addition, former Time - Life correspondent Andrew St. George — who knew Sturgis quite well and spent time with Sturgis alongside Castro in the hills of Cuba during the Cuban revolution — has also reported that it was well known among anti - Castro Cuban exiles that Sturgis had also worked for the Mossad and had done so for a long period of time. 632"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"[236] F inal Judgment 297 In fact, as St. George has also revealed, during the heyday of the CIA's anti - Castro operations in Miami with which Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt were so closely associated, some 12 to 16 Mossad agents worked out of Miami under the command of Mossad Deputy Director Yehuda S. Sipper, their influence reaching throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Citing a 1976 CI A memo, Professor John Newman who has investigated CIA knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities says that Sturgis founded the International Anti - Communist Brigade and that \"the backers of Sturgis' group have never been fully established.\" 633 JFK writer s Warren Hinckle and William Turner have said that \"most of [Sturgis'] funding came from dispossessed casino owners and was funneled through Norman Roughouse' Rothman,\" 634 who was, according to author Gus Russo, not only \"the partner of Meyer Lansky\" 635 bu t also the original \"mobster middleman\" 636 between the CIA and the Lansky syndicate in the Castro assassination plots. Russo, however, says that Rothman's support for Sturgis came \"from unknown sources\" yet cites Hinckle and Turner as his source. So the qu estion remains: just who really was funding Sturgis? Could the Sturgis brigade have been part of the Mossad's Miami - based operations, intertwined with Sturgis' own CIA - sponsored intrigue in the same sphere of influence during the same period? STURGIS, BAN ISTER, FERRIE AND OSWALD As we shall see, this speculation may not be far off the mark. Newman adds that a reported \"sub - unit\" 637 of Sturgis' Brigade was CIA contract agent Gerry Patrick Hemming's Intercontinental Penetration Force (known as \"Interpen\"). Citing a February 1, 1977 CIA Security Office memo, Newman says the anti - Castro Cuban training grounds around Lake Ponchartrain outside New Orleans were run by Hemming as part of Interpen and that Sturgis was connected with those Interpen operations. 638 Those activities around Lake Ponchartrain are known to have involved two of the key players surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the JFK assassination: CIA contract agents Guy Banister and David Ferrie. In fact, there is an Israeli connection to Interpe n. According to Hemming himself, Interpen's \"most important contact in the United States\" 639 was New York financier, Theodore Racoosin, whom Hemming described as \"one of the key founders of the state of Israel.\" 640 After having read Final Judgment, Hemmi ng frankly told the author that although he personally has seen no evidence that convinces him the Mossad participated directly in the JFK assassination, he did say that \"I have known since the late 1960s that the Mossad was aware of the JFK murder even be fore it happened, and they later did a full investigation on the matter and have since retained all such files.\" 641 [Emphasis added.] M O SSAD T EN T AC L ES SUR RO U ND O S WA LD"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"298 Double Cross in Dallas? [237] In any case, we not only find CIA asset Clay Shaw of New Orleans tied to the Mossad th rough his association with the Permindex operation (as were Banister and Ferrie), but we also find two other CIA - connected players in the anti - Castro operations out of New Orleans (Sturgis and Hemming) were in the Mossad's sphere of influence. And Lee Harv ey Oswald is tied to all of the key players involved. In light of all of this, we would not be venturing into the world of fantasy to suggest that the operation involving Sturgis, Marita Lorenz and the anti - Castro Cubans who traveled to Dallas, arriving th ere on November 21, 1963 to meet with E. Howard Hunt (and then with Jack Ruby) was actually a Mossad \"false flag\" operation, deliberately involving a clique of anti - Castro Cubans manipulated by their Mossad - connected CIA handler. Since, according to Miss L orenz, Sturgis later admitted that his team in Dallas did actually participate in the assassination, it is conceivable that although Sturgis and his group did meet up with Hunt in Dallas that Hunt himself did not know that the Sturgis team was going to be involved in an actual assassination attempt or thought they were only involved in a \"dummy\" assassination attempt — if he even knew that much. As we have said, Hunt's knowledge — or lack thereof — remains a mystery and his actual culpability in any assassination conspiracy per se cannot be pinned down. But the circumstances do suggest that Hunt does know a lot more about what happened in Dallas than he has admitted. In any event, there is no question that, based on the facts about Sturgis that we now do know that at least one person who has reportedly confessed to actual involvement in the JFK assassination — Frank Sturgis — did have multiple longtime links to the Mossad for many years prior to (and after) the time of the JFK assassination. This, in itself, is a major revelation and one that is quite relevant when considering the thesis put forth in Final Judgment. A character named Chauncey Holt, who claims to have been in Dallas and involved in the circumstances surrounding the assassination summarized things quite w ell. According to Holt: \"Dallas that day was flooded with all kinds of people who ended up there for some reason. It's always been my theory that whoever was the architect of this thing — and no one will ever know who was behind it, manipulating all these pe ople. I believe that they flooded this area with so many characters with nefarious reputations because they thought, 'Well, if all these people get scooped up it'll muddy the waters so much that they'll never straighten it out.\" 642 That there were peop le in Dallas on the day JFK was killed who may not have known the real reason they were there is also buttressed by other sources. Michael Milan, whose book The Squad outlines his role in working as part of a secret U.S. government team collaborating with the Lansky Syndicate says that there were at least several people operating in Dallas who believed that they were not involved in a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy, but, instead, in a conspiracy to kill Texas Governor John B. Connally. (We first conside red Milan's claims in Chapter 14.) 643"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"[238] Final Judgment 299 Could some of those involved in the JFK assassination been manipulated into believing that they were involved in a plot against Connally (when in fact the ultimate target was Kennedy)? Under such a scenario — without d elving into the mechanics of the JFK assassination that have been considered time and again by those fascinated by the subject — it is possible that one of the assassins in Dealey Plaza did, in fact, take deliberate aim at Connally, perhaps not knowing that, at the same time, other assassins of whom he was unaware, were, from another location, taking aim at JFK. The Connally shooter was, in effect, a decoy. In his biography of Connally, James Reston, Jr. suggests that Oswald had been recruited by Jack Ruby as part of an organized crime plan to kill Connally, rather than Kennedy. Reston suggests that Kennedy was the victim, purely by chance. THE MOSSAD'S JFK COVER STORY . . . The unusual contention that Connally was the target and that Kennedy was an unintend ed victim has some very interesting support. Former Mossad operative Victor Ostrovsky writes in his book By Way of Deception that part of his Mossad training included an in - depth review of the JFK assassination which was part of the required course of stud y for all new Mossad recruits. According to Ostrovsky: \"One particularly intriguing aspect of the course was a movie called, \"A President on the Crosshairs,\" a detailed study of the November 22, 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. \"The Mossad theory was that the killers — Mafiosa hit men, not Lee Harvey Oswald — actually wanted to murder then Texas Governor John Connally, who was in the car with JFK but was only wounded. \"Oswald was seen as a dupe in the whole thing and Connally as the target of mobsters try ing to muscle their way into the oil business. \"The Mossad believed that the official version of the assassination was pure, unadulterated hokum. To test their theory, they did a simulation exercise of the presidential cavalcade to see if expert marksmen w ith far better equipment than Oswald's could hit a moving target from the recorded distance of 88 yards. They couldn't. It would have been the perfect cover. If Connally had been killed, everyone would have assumed it was an attempt on JFK. If they'd wante d to get Kennedy, they could have got him anywhere.\" He writes: \"According to what we found, the rifle was probably aimed at the back of Connally's head, and JFK gestured or moved just at the wrong moment — or possibly the assassin hesitated.\" 644 Now what O strovsky notes further is of particular interest, especially in light of the theory presented in Final Judgment . According to Ostrovsky, the Mossad had every film taken of the Dallas assassination, pictures of the area, the topography, aerial photographs — e verything."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"300 Double Cross in Dallas? [239] Is it possible that the reason that the Mossad had so much information about Dealey Plaza was not because the Mossad studied the area AFTER the Kennedy assassination but BEFORE the assassination? That the Mossad would go to the length of calcul ating an extensive cover story (presented to its own recruits) is interesting in itself and perhaps further evidence that the Mossad had a very particular interest in the JFK assassination. There were clearly many forces at work in Dealey Plaza, perhaps be yond the comprehension of any one conspirator — including Oswald, Ruby or even Hunt or Sturgis or any of the others involved. Some of the conspirators may have indeed been led to believe this was a Mafia hit on Connally and that it, in fact, turned out to be a hit on Kennedy. The Mossad story that it was a botched operation aimed at Connally and resulting in the accidental killing of Kennedy sounds like nothing less than — to borrow a phrase from Ostrovsky — \"pure, unadulterated hokum\" coming from the Mossad itse lf. And then there is the question of the manner in which Lee Harvey Oswald was being made to appear as though he were a pro - Castro/pro - Soviet agitator through the Mexico City Scenario (orchestrated by the CIA) and of his manipulation in New Orleans by the Clay Shaw - Guy Banister apparatus, which, in turn was directly involved in the activities of CIA and Mossad asset Frank Sturgis in the affairs at Lake Ponchartrain. Did Oswald think that he was, in fact, operating on behalf of the CIA — even on behalf of Joh n F. Kennedy himself — setting up a \"phony\" assassination attempt that could be blamed on Castro, igniting international fury at the Cuban leader? We'll probably never know the truth. The bottom line is this: at all critical times when Oswald was being set u p as the patsy — and following the assassination itself — the fine hand of Israel's Mossad and its allies in the CIA is evident. FALSE FLAGS IN DEALEY PLAZA? Is it possible that some of the other conspirators at the lowest levels were led to believe that the whole operation was designed to kill the two proverbial birds with one stone: that is (1) To eliminate Connally, who was allegedly perceived to be a roadblock in the way of the mob, and, in turn (2) To force Kennedy — or otherwise give him the excuse — to finally tak e action against Fidel Castro who had shut down organized crime operations in Cuba? Could, for example, some of the conspirators been told that the plan was to kill Connally and make it appear as though it were a Castro - sponsored bullet intended for the pr esident which missed — and thereby force Kennedy into retaliating against Castro? One can only imagine, for example, the surprise of a hidden gunman firing at John Connally when he realized that another gunman was firing at John F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"[240] Final Judgment 301 Or, dare we sugg est the most frightening possibility of all: did John F.

One could spend hours concocting a variety of scenarios. However, all of the evidence we have seen suggests that the JFK assassination conspiracy was multi - leveled and ranging out in a variety of directions. Were all of these \"characters with nefa rious reputations\" simply \"false flags\" being utilized by what Chauncey Holt called \"the architect of this thing\"? Were these JFK assassination \"suspects\" brought there by a force which wanted to \"muddy the waters\"? If so, we cannot help but be reminded of the Mossad's famous use of false flags in its criminal endeavors. Was there a \"dummy assassination\" attempt, and if so, who — or what — was the force that intervened? One investigator, Scott Thompson, who believes in the \"dummy assassination\" theory, has gone so far as to charge that the provocation against Castro was being carried out with the full knowledge of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Thompson alleges that E. Howard Hunt was, in fact, in charge of coordinating the fraudulent assassination attempt . Thompson notes, however, that \"it remains unclear to this day who intervened into the dummy assassination set - up and turned it into the real thing.” 645 Former CIA contract agent Robert Morrow has lent credence to the \"dummy assassination attempt\" scenar io. Morrow has reported that he had been told that CIA operatives, working with Cuban exiles, \"had some kind of test they were doing, a fake assassination attempt against Kennedy. \"646 Writing in Farewell America under the pseudonym \"James Hepburn,\" veteran French intelligence officer Herve LaMarre suggests: \"Oswald was probably told that he had been chosen to participate in a new anti - Communist operation together with [David] Ferrie and several other agents. \"The plan consisted of influencing public opinion by simulating an attack against President Kennedy, whose policy of coexistence with the Communists deserved a reprimand. Another assassination attempt, also designed to arouse public feeling, had been simulated on April 10 against General [Edwin A.] Walke r.\" 647 MORE CIA - MOSSAD DISINFORMATION? Although Farewell America has been an oft - quoted \"underground\" classic among JFK researchers, its origins are murky, to say the least. While the book contains much intriguing information, there is a very good possib ility that the book is classic CIA - Mossad disinformation. According to JFK researchers Warren Hinckle and William Turner, Farewell America was prepared under the direction and imprimatur of French President Charles DeGaulle, who was, as we noted in Chapter 15, a victim of assassination attempts financed by the Permindex operation that played"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"302 Double Cross in Dallas? [241] the central part in the JFK assassination conspiracy. 648 However, according to JFK writer Gus Russo, the book's origins are a little more complicated than that. Russo claims that shortly after the JFK assassination — when Robert Kennedy launched a private inquiry into his brother's murder, utilizing a British intelligence asset who was a long - time Kennedy family friend (an inquiry which we referenced at the beginning of Chapter 9) — the British investigator hired two former French intelligence operatives to conduct the investigation. Russo says that one was Andre Ducret, former head of the French intelligence agency, and that the other was known only as \"Philippe,\" but beli eved to be Philippe deVosjoli, former head of French intelligence in Washington. The French investigators then spent several years conducting the investigation, finally providing RFK a report that alleged, generally, that Texas oil barons in league with Ly ndon Johnson had been behind the assassination. Although RFK was killed shortly after receiving the report, the British agent who sponsored the investigation asked the surviving brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, what should be done with the report. Kennedy said his family was not interested, according to Russo, and at that point the report was turned over to Herve LaMarre who then fashioned the report into the book Farewell America. While never published in the United States, the book nonetheless received \"u nderground\" distribution here. 649 However, while the book (and the report on which it was based) may have contained grains of truth, there is good reason to believe that it was largely CIA - Mossad disinformation. Here's why: If indeed Philippe deVosjoli was one of those who handled the \"investigation\" for the Kennedy friend in British intelligence, the fact is that Vosjoli had a \"long friendship [and] special relationship\" with the Mossad's CIA loyalist James J. Angleton 650 to the point that deVosjoli not o nly refused French orders to spy on the United States, but instead apparently helped Angleton conduct espionage against France. 651 Considering this, we can understand why Farewell America was so vague and so inconclusive and steered the finger of blame awa y from both the CIA and the Mossad, and, for that matter, suppressed the little - known \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination that has been long discussed, but which, if dissected as we shall now do here, points directly toward not only Angleton at th e CIA, but the manipulations of disloyal elements in French intelligence by both Angleton and his Mossad allies. It's an amazing story that has never been told before, but which we will outline here for the first time ever. THE FRENCH CONNECTION . . . In a private communication to this author after he read the first draft of Final Judgment — sent to him by no less than former U.S. Congressman Paul Findley (R - Ill.) — former French intelligence officer Pierre Neuville stated (based on his own inside knowledge) that a French team — professional"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"[242] Final Judgment 303 assassins — were among the actual shooters in Dealey Plaza, committing the crime at the behest of the Israeli Mossad. (In the Postscript to this volume we review the remarkable story of this Frenchman and his own astounding e xperiences with the Mossad.) In Neuville's judgment: \"Never the Prime Minister of Israel would have involved Mossad people, American Jews or CIA personnel in the execution part of the conspiracy. Even the CIA contract the services of other members of the i ntelligence community (they like the French style) to wash dirty linens. The right hand does not know what the left did. The cover - up team doesn't know who execute. And the executioners are not interested in the aftermath of their mission. They don't care less.\" 652 According to Neuville's sources, then - Mossad assassination chief Yitzhak Shamir (later prime minister of Israel) arranged the hiring of at least one of the assassins through the deputy chief of the French intelligence service (the SDECE), Colonel Georges deLannurien. \"It was no coincidence,\" Neuville wrote, \"that on the very day of the execution of the president by the French team that [deLannurien] was at Langley meeting with James Jesus Angleton, the Mossad mole.\" According to Neuville, \"There a re no coincidences in the suspicion business — just cover - ups. The case of communist infiltration of the French secret service was an appropriate cover - up to justify the presence of Colonel deLannurien at Langley, Virginia.\" 653 It seems obvious that Angleto n and deLannurien were together for a very specific purpose: damage control — making sure that the assassination cover - up fell into place after the crime itself had been committed. Angleton himself told the House Assassinations Committee that de Lannurien ha d come to his office for just that purpose: seeking assistance in routing out communist moles in the SDECE. 654 This controversy — alleged KGB infiltration into French intelligence — was a direct result of Angleton's machinations. It was Angleton (often prodd ed by his Mossad allies) who had a history of fingering alleged Soviet infiltrators in other nations' intelligence services, creating mass disarray, confusion, bitterness and resentment in their ranks. Following World War II Angleton served as American int elligence liaison with the SDECE and maintained close friendships with a number of French intelligence officials throughout his career. And undoubtedly these were Frenchmen who shared Angleton's devotion to Israel. One particularly embittered high - ranking SDECE officer, Leonard Houneau, who had been caught in Angleton's web and was ultimately cleared of the slander that he was a Soviet mole, later said, \"The whole story was invented. Angleton was a madman and an alcoholic. He was trying to set us against on e another.\" 655 THE OAS MERCENARY Interestingly enough, it was OAS mercenary, Jean Souetre, who approached the CIA in June of 1963 with information on alleged"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"304 Double Cross in Dallas? [243] communists in the DeGaulle government and in French intelligence — one of Angleton's widely - docu mented preoccupations. 656 Angleton would have been very much \"in the know\" as to Souetre's activities (and, indeed, may have been actively collaborating with Souetre). In Chapter 12 we noted that it was Souetre who was picked up in Dallas on November 22, 1 963 and expelled from the United States and who was also CIA man E. Howard Hunt's OAS liaison. It was Souetre who also maintained an informal OAS outpost at Guy Banister's office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. What's more, Souetre maintained ties with Meyer Lansky's allies in the Corsican Mafia. All of this, certainly, suggests a very clear pattern which spells more than coincidence. The plot thickens, however. As we saw in Chapter 12, there is some question as to whether the individual picked up in Dal las was, in fact, Souetre or someone using his name. Souetre has suggested that it was another Frenchman, one Michael Mertz, who may have been the guilty party who was actually in Dallas and using Souetre's name. What makes this allegation most provocative is that Mertz was a former French SDECE officer who had infiltrated the anti - DeGaulle OAS and foiled a plot against DeGaulle's life. 657 (There is firm evidence that in at least one instance Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion \"foiled\" an OAS \"plot\" a gainst DeGaulle, bringing the conspiracy to DeGaulle's attention. As a consequence, according to Ben - Gurion's biographer, \"Ben - Gurion now received [DeGaulle's] gratitude.\" 658 (In this particular instance, however, the alleged conspirator was released sinc e there was not enough evidence to keep him in custody. 659 Was this \"plot\" perhaps — in reality — an Israeli operation designed to bring Israel back into DeGaulle's good graces? We can only speculate. We can only speculate, likewise, that perhaps Mertz's rescu e of DeGaulle from yet another \"plot\" may have also been a similar Israeli - orchestrated operation.) In any case, Mertz's connections went much further. Mertz was also engaged in the illegal drug racket, said to be Paris connection man for the Lansky - Traffi cante - Corsican Mafia network examined in Chapter 12. 660 Just shortly after the JFK assassination, Dr. Lawrence Alderson, a Houston dentist, was questioned by the FBI. Alderson, who had struck up a friendship with the real Jean Souetre while both were in t heir respective country's armed services, said that he was told that \"The FBI felt Souetre had either killed JFK or knew who had done it.\" 661 And that could have included the aforementioned Mertz. Former CIA insider Robert Morrow, enmeshed in much of the i ntrigue surrounding the activities of the Clay Shaw - Guy Banister operation in New Orleans, contends it was Mertz who was on one of the assassination teams that struck down John F. Kennedy in Dallas. 662 According to Morrow, Mertz was on the Angleton - supervi sed CIA ZR/Rifle Team of foreign mercenaries which included the mysterious assassin code - named QJ/WIN. Aside from Mertz, among others put forth as possible French - connected"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"[244] Final Judgment 305 assassins in the events in Dealey Plaza include Robert Blemant, a narcotics traffi cker and intermediary between the Corsican Mafia and the CIA; and Joe Attia, a heroin financier and assassin for the SDECE. 663 According to JFK researcher Steve Revele, \"Recently released top - secret CIA documents indicate that CIA assassin QJ/WIN was a Lu xembourg - based smuggler named Jose Mankel, and the other, WI/ROGUE, was a Soviet - born Paris bank robber David Dzitzichvili (also spelled Tzitzichvili; alias David Dato).\" 664 The bottom line, though, is that all of those mentioned have precisely the kind of connections that link them to not only the CIA, but also French intrigue and thence to Israel and its Mossad. ISRAEL'S FRENCH CONNECTIONS Although the SDECE was DeGaulle's own service, the agency was as much apparently out of DeGaulle's actual hands - o n control as the CIA was out of JFK's control. As DeGaulle's biographer said of the fight between DeGaulle and the OAS, the conflict was \"within the State itself.\" 665 In fact, at least one assassination attempt against DeGaulle by the Permindex - and Isra eli - backed OAS came as a direct result of \"inside\" information. 666 What's more, there was one high - ranking SDECE official, Louis Betholini, later discovered to be \"an OAS sleeper [secret agent].\" 667 And according to historian Paul Henissart, there was — wi thin the SDECE — a high percentage of anti - DeGaulle officers who were, in fact, sympathetic to the OAS. Like its self - centered American counterpart, the CIA, \"the SDECE's main worry, according to well - informed sources, was to protect its own personnel and in terests during [the] difficult period [of conflict between DeGaulle and the OAS]. 668 Intelligence historian Richard Deacon has noted, for his own part, that in France, during this difficult period, there was \"a good deal of unofficial support for Israel, notably in the [SDECE]\" 669 pointing further toward the role of SDECE officers in arranging the assassination of John F. Kennedy on behalf of its allies in the Israeli Mossad. According to Stewart Steven, an authority on the history of the Mossad, \"Brillia nt in many respects, the SDECE had the reputation internationally of being the rogue elephant of the world's intelligence circus. The CIA regarded it as being 'leaky as a sieve,' and probably with some justification, for few services had so many department al heads constantly at loggerheads with one another, all serving different masters, either within France itself or in some cases abroad. \"The Israelis, however, had always got along with the French service very well. As an ally in the tricky world in which the Mossad was obliged to operate, the SDECE had proved itself extremely useful, principally because its officers did not feel obliged to necessarily receive political authority for its operations. This gave the service a freebooting quality very much lik e the Israelis themselves but without Israeli discipline and order."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"306 Double Cross in Dallas? [245 ] \"Mossad's contacts within the service,\" said Steven, \"tended to be with the ex - OAS elements, those opposed to DeGaulle for what they believed to be his sell - out of French interests in the Algerian war of independence.\" 670 JACKAL OR JACL? To complicate matters, DeGaulle himself had reached a truce with the OAS in early 1963 and had helped arrange for its members to set up operations elsewhere. 671 One or more of these \"former\" enemies of DeGaulle, now operating under the auspices of his own intelligence service, or at least within its sphere of influence, may have been brought into the JFK assassination conspiracy. The likelihood that an Israeli - linked faction of DeGaulle's intelligence s ervice, the SDECE, might have recruited an assassin — particularly a Corsican — for the hit against JFK is very strong. The SDECE was divided into five \"services.\" Service Five was known as \"Action\" and was dominated by Corsicans. According to Frederick Forsyt h's background account of the conflict between DeGaulle and the OAS (the subject of his novel, The Day of the Jackal) these Corsicans, \"had been professional thugs from the underworld before being enlisted, kept up their old contacts, and on more than one occasion enlisted the aid of their former underworld friends to do a particularly dirty job for the government. \"It was these activities that gave rise to talk in France of a 'parallel' (unofficial) police, supposedly at the orders of one of President de G aulle's right - hand men, M. Jacques Foccart. In truth no 'parallel' police existed; the activities attributed to them were carried out by the Action Service strong - arms or temporarily enlisted gang - bosses from the `milieu.’” 672 In light of Forsyth's famous \"Jackal,\" it might be noted that active in Europe during the period of the joint plots against JFK and Charles DeGaulle was a Jewish terrorist group known as the Jewish Anti - Communist League — or JACL. This JACL in fact, collaborated with the OAS. So it see ms Frederick Forsyth knew whereof he spoke when he described a fictional OAS - sponsored \"Jackal\" seeking to destroy DeGaulle. THE INTRIGUE COMES FULL CIRCLE However, there is even more evidence suggesting that the so - called \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination is indeed, instead, the Israeli connection reaching all the way to Dallas. In 1965 a bizarre crime took place which exposed the close ties between certain elements in DeGaulle's intelligence agency, the Israeli Mossad and the French Corsican Mafia underworld. And, incredibly enough, this same crime implicated individuals whose names have been linked with the JFK assassination as a consequence of subsequent revelations. The crime in question was the murder of a Moroccan political figure, one Me hdi Ben - Barka who was a critic of the ruling regime in his native country. (Although an Arab regime, the Moroccan government maintained covert cooperation with the Mossad.)"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"[246] Final Judgmen t 307 Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi assessed the parameters of Ben - Barka's de mise as follows: \"The Mossad became involved in the kidnapping of Ben - Barka in Paris. He was later murdered in cold blood. Since the affair took place on French soil, and involved collaboration with right - wing [i.e. pro - OAS] elements in the [SDECE], it led to a major political crisis, to a purge of the service by DeGaulle.” 673 The irony for DeGaulle was immense. According to historian Stewart Steven, \"As always . . . one arm of the SDECE didn't know what the other was doing. As one department [of the SDECE ] was arranging for Ben Barka's assassination, another [arm of the French intelligence agency] was organizing a regular monthly paycheck paid [Ben Barka] through a French scientific research center, one of the covers for the extensive SDECE operation in Af rica.\" 674 Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman, Israeli historians, commented on the crisis as follows: \"De Gaulle, who suspected that his secret agency might be plotting against him, was absolutely furious. He immediately ordered that the secret service's house be put in order. He also directed his anger at Israel.\" 675 The French president \"ordered that the Mossad's European command be removed from Paris, and he also ordered a cessation of all intelligence cooperation between the two nations.\" 676 According to his torian Stewart Steven, \"As far as President DeGaulle was concerned, the implications were that Israel was dealing with the OAS in France, which was still active, still bent on revenge, and indubitably involved through its supporters in the SDECE in the kil ling of Ben Barka. It meant that Israel was involved in illegal activities on French soil, an affront to French nationalism, and it meant that he himself, whose support for Israel had never been challenged, had been dealt with treacherously.\" 677 According to Steven, the Mossad expulsion from Paris was \"a severe blow, perhaps the most severe the Israeli secret service has ever suffered . . . DeGaulle was never to forgive Israel.\" 678 CHRISTIAN DAVID It just so happens that a chief suspect in the Ben - Barka murder was one Christian David, a French gangster who was a known associate of the aforementioned Michael Mertz, alleged participant in the JFK murder. Ex - Army intelligence officer William Spector told JFK assassination researcher Jim Marrs that David was part of the CIA's ZR/Rifle Team which was under Angleton's supervision and which included the aforementioned assassin, QJ/WIN. What makes this all the more intriguing is that David has claimed knowledge of a French team of assassins being involved in the JFK murder. 6 7 9 David himself claims to have been offered a contract to kill JFK by the Lansky - connected Guerini brothers, the leaders of the CIA - backed French Corsican Mafia in Marseille. 680"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"308 Double Cross in Dallas? [247] Incredibly, the French connections come full circle. It was the CIA's QJ/WIN who used his influence to secure the release of one Thomas Eli Davis III from a Moroccan jail after Davis was arrested in North Africa for supplying arms to the OAS. And it was Jack Ruby (who killed Lee Harvey Oswald) who mentioned to his law yers his connection with Davis. Ruby said that he and Davis had run guns and jeeps to Cuba. 681 THE CIRCLES INTERSECT IN DALLAS That Charles DeGaulle would have had an interest in getting to the bottom of the JFK assassination is evident, inasmuch as th ere were multiple French connections to key players in the conspiracy. DeGaulle clearly discovered that elements of French intelligence and/or agents of his sworn enemies in the OAS had been brought into the JFK assassination conspiracy by the Mossad. It s eems apparent that one or more of the French assassins who played a role in the events in Dallas were recruited by the Mossad through its allies within DeGaulle's intelligence service. In addition, those in the CIA - connected New Orleans faction of the assa ssination conspiracy — those framing Lee Harvey Oswald as a pro - Castro agitator — were tied directly the OAS network and the Mossad's Permindex operation that had conspired against DeGaulle. And at CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia there was the Mossad's d evoted friend and longtime associate of top SDECE officials, James J. Angleton, engaged in intrigue that clearly points to his own involvement in the conspiracy and the subsequent cover - up. Even the CIA's E. Howard Hunt was tied directly to the French conn ection as CIA liaison to the OAS. In the end, Hunt's apparent visit to Dallas just prior to the assassinatio n — evidently at Angleton's orders — where he met with longtime Mossad asset Frank Sturgis, put Hunt squarely in the middle of the intrigue. The later a ttempt to publicly link Hunt to the assassination reaches directly back to Angleton. T h e s e d e t a i l s , t a k e n t o g e t h e r w i t h a l l t h a t w e h a v e e x a m i n e d i n t h e p a g e s o f F i n a l J u d g m e n t , e x p l a i n t h e s o - c a l l e d \" F r e n c h c o n n e c t i o n \" t o t h e J F K a s s a s s i n a t i o n , a l t h o u g h , a s w e h a v e s e e n , t h e o r i g i n o f t h e c o n s p i r a c y t o kill the American president was not, in fact, French. There were, very clearly, many, many people involved in the periphery of the assassination conspiracy — whether as active conspirators or not. French Pre sident DeGaulle had a direct interest in finding out how his own intelligence service and/or individuals connected thereto had been manipulated by the Mossad and a direct interest in covering it up. DeGAULLE STRIKES BACK"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"[248] Final Judgment 309 DeGaulle's inquiries into the ac tivities of the SDECE in the year following the JFK assassination had an interesting consequence. The Mossad's CIA man James J. Angleton's own machinations — his purported discovery of KGB \"moles\" in the SDECE's ranks — had created havoc in French intelligence forcing the French president to take action. According to Angleton's biographer, Tom Mangold: \"Within the year, DeGaulle finally lost his patience with the CIA. The French president, quietly, without any publicity, issued an order terminating all joint op erations between SDECE and the CIA. For the next three years the two services remained estranged, a break without precedent between the two friendly countries.\" 682 This, of course, recalls DeGaulle's decision during the same time frame — as noted previously — to expel the Mossad from France. In light of all that we have considered here, it is likely that a large part of DeGaulle's move against Angleton's CIA and Angleton's Mossad allies arose directly from his discovery that his own intelligence service had be en directly compromised through the involvement of SDECE officer Georges deLannurien in helping facilitate the JFK assassination. PERMINDEX AND THE FRENCH CONNECTION As we saw in Chapter 15, the Permindex connection (through Clay Shaw in New Orleans) did indeed tie together not only the CIA and the Lansky Syndicate and the Mossad — but also the French connection to the assassination conspiracy. Unfortunately, however, although New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison knew about Permindex, Garrison — at leas t at the time of the Shaw trial — according to Paris Flammonde, felt that Permindex \"did not touch directly\" 683 on the conspiracy. Evidently Garrison perceived Permindex as only an indication of Shaw's intelligence connections and nothing more. However, as assassination researcher James DiEugenio, in one of his more perceptive comments, points out: \"This is questionable, but even so, Shaw's European connections would have had some effect on his carefully constructed image\" 684 as some sort of \"Wilsonian - FDR - Kennedy liberal.\" 685 Garrison's own words suggest that he may have had some direction from French intelligence. At one point Garrison said that he had learned that the conspirators plotting the JFK assassination had been penetrated by a foreign intelligen ce service, but that it had \"been for reasons wholly unrelated to an investigation of the president's murder.\" 686 In fact, this \"unrelated\" matter could have been (and this is speculation, of course) an investigation by DeGaulle into Shaw and the New Orle ans conspirators because of their collaboration with the OAS in plots against DeGaulle. Unfortunately, at least at first, the \"French connection\" (which is actually the Israeli connection) seems to have gone right by Garrison and perhaps led in part to his failure to convict Shaw in the JFK conspiracy. We do know that by the late 1970s, the House Assassinations Committee inquiry was looking into the \"French connection.\" However,"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"310 Double Cross in Dallas? [249] according to Dick Russell, one committee investigator, Mike Ewing, said the co mmittee \"was working on the 'French connection' angle when it closed up shop\" in 1978. 687 Thus, as a consequence, the official \"investigation\" never went as far as it could have and the Israeli connection — through the so - called \"French Connection” — remained under wraps (as the conspirators certainly intended). ISRAEL, AGAIN In fact, there is an Israeli connection to evidence linking OAS elements to a plot against President Kennedy. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Dick Russell describes the strange story of U S Army Private Eugene Dinkin, a military code - breaker in Europe who — just prior to JFK's assassination — was monitoring and decoding telegraphic traffic that originated within the French OAS. Russell says that (as known by the CIA and the Warren Commission in 1964) Dinkin had discovered OAS foreknowledge of an assassination plot against President Kennedy supposed to take place in Texas. Unfortunately, for Dinkin, according to Russell, \"nobody would give him the time of day except the Israeli ambassador to Luxe mbourg who . . . advised him how best to present his case at the American embassy there.\" 688 Poor Dinkin, obviously, had no idea that the Israelis (whom he perceived to be American allies) were, in fact, working closely behind the scenes with the OAS - conn ected plotters in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Thus, by taking his story to the Israelis, Dinkin was effectively alerting the OAS (and the conspirators) that he had stumbled upon their connections to the impending assassination of the president. This is just another of those fascinating details — somehow missed by the JFK assassination researchers — that points further toward the Israeli connection. THE DRIVING FORCE There clearly is much more to the so - called \"French\" connection to the assassination of President Kennedy than meets the eye. Here in Final Judgment, however, we have outlined the parameters of the French connection as it has never been done. Pinning down the truth of precisely what happened in Dealey Plaza will never be possible, but we beli eve that in the pages of Final Judgment we have come closer to the truth than ever before. The information supplied by the former French intelligence officer relative to Israeli Mossad orchestration of the JFK assassination through the a egis of other intel ligence networks, specifically James J.

Unless and until the press repudiates that choice, it is unlikely that we shall ever know the truth.\" 689 These are the words of lon gtime JFK assassination researcher Jerry Pollicoff summarizing the attitude of the Establishment media toward its coverage of the crime of the century. T h e m e d i a w a s c o n t e n t t o c h u r n u p v i r t u a l l y e v e r y t h e o r y imaginable — up to a point — except one: that Israe l was behind the assassination, a theory widely held in the Arab world at least. However, as we have seen, in Chapter 5, in particular, very little was in fact known about JFK's secret war with Israel and the major Middle East foreign policy turn - about tha t came on the heels of JFK's assassination. Thus, even the harshest critics of the Warren Commission which ostensibly \"investigated\" — most would say \"covered up\" — the assassination conspiracy had no reason to suspect that there might be an Israeli connection to JFK's murder. The final conclusions of the Warren Commission hardly satisfied anybody — except, of course, for the friends of Israel and the CIA in the Establishment media who gave the Report's conclusions wholehearted support.

Without question — and this is significant — the media almost unanimously sided with the Warren Report, despite all of the evidence which proved the report a fraud. The media would not tolerate dissent. As far as the media was concerned, the JFK controversy was closed. Period. GARRISON AND THE CIA - MOSSAD LINK The media certainly went into a frenzy with its hysterical covera ge of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's 1967 - 1969 inquiry into the JFK murder and his prosecution of Crescent City businessman Clay Shaw. At the time Garrison began pursuing Shaw, the facts that we now know today about Shaw and his connections w ith the Lansky - Mossad - CIA - linked Permindex operation based in Rome, were not so obvious. It wasn't, in fact, until 1975 that former CIA official Victor Marchetti acknowledged publicly that Shaw had ties to the CIA and that the CIA was very much interested in assisting Shaw during the period of his prosecution in New Orleans. 690 Former CIA Director Richard Helms himself subsequently admitted under oath that Shaw had CIA connections. If Jim Garrison had had that proof at the time of Shaw's trial, the verdict indeed may have been different. 691 ANGELTON'S INTERVENTION There is yet additional evidence of attempts by the CIA to undermine Garrison's investigation. This evidence directly implicates the CIA's director of counterintelligence, James J. Angleton, who se own unique ties to the Mossad and whose central role in the JFK conspiracy cover - up we examined in Chapter 8, Chapter 15 and Chapter 16. Author Anthony Summers, in his recently - released biography of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, described how the alleged compromising photos of Hoover engaged in homosexual activities (described in Chapter 7) managed to surface in relation to the Garrison investigation. According to Summers, he was told by former CIA contract operative Gordon Novel that he (Novel) w as shown such photos by James J. Angleton. Novel, who operated out of New Orleans, had popped up in Jim Garrison's investigation as a possible suspect and, as a direct consequence, he (Novel) had filed a lawsuit against Garrison. Novel said that he was bei ng urged to pursue his lawsuit against the New Orleans district attorney by his associates in the CIA, but that Hoover was opposed to the lawsuit. It was then that Angleton contacted Novel, displayed the compromising photos, and suggested that Novel discre etly advise Hoover that he had seen the photos which Novel says he did, much to the FBI director's dismay. 692"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"314 They Dare Not Speak Out [253] Clearly, Garrison was on the right track. When he launched his investigation of Shaw, Garrison thought he was doing his patriotic duty. He was trying to prosecute a man he believed was connected to the JFK assassination conspiracy. Garrison was trying to bring our president's killers to justice. However, the New Orleans district attorney was greeted with a hurricane onslaught by the media — and, in particular, a media outlet with close ties to elements in the pro - Israel lobby. THE 'STERN GANG' The evidence indicates, in fact, that the fine hand of pro - Israel propagandists were at work, orchestrating the attack on Garrison. Leading the assault on t he district attorney was NBC's New Orleans television (and radio) affiliate, WDSU. The owner of WDSU was Edgar Stern, of the powerful New Orleans Stern family, major contributors to not only the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Appeal, but also the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith. 693 Additionally, a close friend of Clay Shaw was Edgar Stern's wife, Edith Stern, whose support for Shaw in the face of his prosecution was prominently noted in James Kirkwood's account of the Shaw tr ial, American Grotesque. 694 As we shall see in this chapter, the ADL not only functions as a foreign intelligence operation for Israel, but it also works closely with American intelligence. More importantly — the ADL uses its influence to play a major role in shaping American media news coverage. This was critical to covering up the truth about the JFK assassination. WDSU's malicious attack on Garrison, however, was a much bigger project than it might have appeared. In fact, NBC national news in New York was the prime mover behind the propaganda campaign against the district attorney. NBC's coordinator for the project was a former Justice Department official, Walter Sheridan, who had also previously worked for the National Security Agency. According to Sherid an, Edgar Stern was \"a courageous, liberal man who shared our views concerning Garrison and his probe. WDSU was the only voice in the Louisiana wilderness speaking out against what Garrison was doing\" 695 However, how courageous and liberal the Stern famil y may have been is subject to question, in light not only of their attack on Garrison, but also in light of their widely known support of the ADL and its activities, particularly in New Orleans. In 1968, during the midst of the Garrison - Shaw controversy, i t was the ADL's New Orleans office that provided $36,500 of its own funds toward an FBI operation designed to entrap Ku Klux Klansman Tommy Tarrants and a young woman named Kathy Ainsworth. In a shoot - out which erupted, Miss Ainsworth was slain. 696 Intere stingly enough, the ADL official in New Orleans who was the prime player in this bizarre conspiracy was A. L. (Bee) Botnick. It was in"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"[254] Final Judgment 315 Chapter 15 that we noted Botnick's close relationship to Guy Banister, the ex - FBI official - turned - CIA coordinator of an ti - Castro Cuban exile activities in New Orleans. It was, of course, out of Banister's office at 544 Camp Street that Lee Harvey Oswald carried out apparent intelligence activities at Banister's instruction and portrayed himself as a pro - Castro agitator. S ABOTAGE The aforementioned Walter Sheridan's involvement in the Garrison case went far beyond being a reporter who was simply out to do a hatchet job. Instead, Sheridan was actually trying to sabotage Garrison's investigation by interfering in the actual course of the inquiry. As Garrison pointed out, Sheridan and his associates were \"going far beyond word games. They were engaged in an organized effort to derail an official investigation of a major city's district attorney's office. They were attempting t o persuade witnesses to alter their testimony, even attempting to move major witnesses permanently to another part of the country.\" 697 MORE FROM 'THE STERN GANG' What is additionally interesting is that the ADL - linked Stern family - run WDSU media had act ually played a primary part in helping promote Lee Harvey Oswald's image as a \"pro - Castro\" activist both before — and after — the assassination of President Kennedy. It was on August 16, 1963 that Oswald and a colleague appeared outside Clay Shaw's Internation al Trade Mart distributing pro - Castro leaflets. Researcher Dick Russell points out two intriguing facts: \"The leafleteers were there for only a few minutes, yet the demonstration was filmed by WDSU - TV, which happened to be on hand — apparently alerted in adv ance. Jessie R. Core III, the public relations man for the International Trade Mart, also attended the leafleting and alerted the FBI immediately afterward.\" 698 So it was that not only did the Stern family's television cameras just happen to be there to ca pture Oswald, the \"pro - Castro\" activist, but Permindex board member Clay Shaw's Trade Mart associate took the effort to report the young \"communist\" to the FBI, thus cementing Oswald's leftist image further. This, however, was not the end of WDSU's involve ment in promoting Oswald's public image as a pro - communist agitator prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. On August 17 William Stuckey of WDSU Radio arranged for a radio interview with Oswald in which the young man proclaimed his leftist views. Then WDSU turned a copy of the tape over to the FBI. There's more. On August 19 WDSU's Stuckey again contacted Oswald and arranged for Oswald to appear in a debate with an anti - Castro activist over his radio station. It was at this time that Oswald proclai med himself a"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"316 They Dare Not Speak Out [255] Marxist. The next day WDSU turned a copy of the debate transcript over to the FBI office in New Orleans. 699 In fact, then, on a second occasion — on August 30 — WDSU Radio again made the transcript of the Oswald radio debate available to the FB I. 700 WDSU was very public spirited indeed. OSWALD'S 'FREE PUBLICITY' The ADL - connected WDSU television and radio had thus provided \"one lone nut\" — Lee Harvey Oswald — with more free publicity than any other single leftist in the city of New Orleans could h ave dreamed about. But WDSU wasn't finished with Oswald. Immediately after Oswald was arrested in Dallas on November 22, it was — once again — WDSU that played a part in portraying Oswald, now to a national television audience, as a pro - Castro agitator. Accord ing to Warren Hinckle and William Turner: \"The NBC Network scored a coup, thanks to its New Orleans affiliate WDSU. Early in the evening it played a tape of Oswald's voice professing admiration for Fidel Castro and declaring, 'I am a Marxist.'\" 701 An inte resting footnote. The young WDSU cameraman who filmed Oswald's demonstration, Johann Rush, emerged some thirty years later — in 1993 — as an \"expert\" whose \"enhancement\" of the Zapruder film of the JFK assassination was hailed as the final proof that Oswald ac ted alone. Rush collaborated with author Gerald Posner in the publication of a volume entitled Case Closed which was widely hailed in the Establishment media as the ultimate refutation of JFK assassination conspiracy theorists. U.S. News & World Report, pu blished by outspoken Israeli enthusiast Mortimer Zuckerman, devoted an extended special issue promoting the book in its cover story However, the Posner - Rush book is rife with errors, contradictions, misstatements and distortions of fact. The book is quite disingenuous in its thesis that while the Warren Commission was wrong on some points — thus sparking criticism — its basic thesis (that Oswald acted alone) was correct. The authors ignore critical evidence of CIA and other intelligence connections to Oswald an d Ruby and suggest that virtually all of the many witnesses who were able to provide information which pointed toward a conspiracy were either mentally unstable or outright liars or both. So it is that Johann Rush, a veteran of WDSU's conspiracy to frame L ee Harvey Oswald as a pro - Castro agitator, has once again returned to the center of the media's cover - up of what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. SHERIDAN'S ISRAEL CONNECTION It was later, of course, that Walter Sheridan, on the payroll of NBC news, came to New Orleans and, aided by WDSU, launched the effort to undermine Jim Garrison to a national television audience, WDSU already"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"[256] Final Judgment 317 having done so much to lay the groundwork for the portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald as a lone communist agitator . In later years, it should be noted, it was Sheridan who set up shop — although he was not a lawyer — at the law firm of Miller, Cassidy, Larroca and Lewin in Washington, D.C. This was the firm of a former Justice Department colleague of Sheridan's named Nath an Lewin who, by this time, had emerged as one of the Israeli lobby's most prominent legmen in the city of Washington. It was fro m his office in Lewin's fir m that Sheridan laid the groundwork for the establishment of a security firm that provided exclusive services to the Caribbean resort empire known as Resorts International: 702 As we noted in Chapter 7, Resorts International is generally perceived as a joint intelligence operation linking the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate alongside the Israeli Mossad. It is fitting, in this context, to note that JFK assassination researcher Peter Dale Scott has pointed out that Walter Sheridan's account of his work in fighting organized crime in the Kennedy Justice Department \"omits such obviously relevant names as those of Meyer Lansky.\" 703 This is not surprising, of course, in light of all that we have seen regarding Sheridan and the forces behind the effort to destroy Jim Garrison's investigation of Clay Shaw and the JFK assassination conspiracy. GARRISON PIL LORIED In any case, it is very clear that forces with close ties to the Israeli lobby were among those leading the assault on Garrison. Garrison was pilloried on national television time and again. He was ruthlessly savaged in the press. His integrity was questioned and his methods of inquiry were called into judgment. So it was with anyone who questioned the \"official\" word on the JFK assassination. The CIA even went to the trouble of preparing a review of Warren Commission critic Mark Lane's best - selling Rush to Judgment that was distributed to CIA friends and assets in the media This was all part and parcel of the campaign to discredit those who were on the brink of uncovering the real truth about the JFK assassination, something that neither Israel nor its allies at the CIA could permit. SABOTAGE FROM WITHIN In his own memoirs, Garrison notes how, time and again, he and his fellow investigators in the New Orleans District Attorneys office discovered evidence that their work was being sabotaged from wit hin. Government infiltrators and others were not only spying on Garrison's activities, but they were attempting to undermine the whole investigation. To Garrison's dismay, even some seemingly dedicated volunteers who had offered to help the professional in vestigators turned out to be saboteurs."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"318 They Dare Not Speak Out [257] One \"volunteer\" helper was a chap whom Garrison describes as \"a young Englishman.\" 704 This young Englishman, in fact, was one Tom Bethell, who later \"broke\" with Garrison — if he had ever really been working on the s ame side as Garrison to begin with — and became a source for Garrison's critics. Perhaps we now know what Bethell's reward was, now that time has passed. Former CIA man William F. Buckley, Jr. later hired on young Bethell as an editor for his National Review magazine, touting him as one of the great young conservative writers of the era. Thanks to Buckley's patronage, Bethell's career as a journalist moved along quite nicely. (In Chapter 9, of course, we reviewed the extensive and repeated connections of Buck ley and his family to a wide variety of key players in the JFK assassination conspiracy — in particular to E. Howard Hunt whose own role we discussed in further detail in Chapter 17.) MORE CIA INTERVENTION? There is other evidence of apparent CIA meddling in the Garrison investigation. When, in 1968, Garrison critic, author James Kirkwood, published his book American Grotesque, he inadvertently let the cat out of the bag regarding an intelligence community - linked effort to sandbag Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw. Describing how journalist James Phelan had provided him (Kirkwood) with his own account of how he (Phelan) was trying to disprove Garrison's case against Shaw, Kirkwood published a transcript of a taped interview he conducted with Phelan. Phelan described how he had arranged to meet with Garrison in Las Vegas (during a vacation interlude by the tired and worn district attorney). At this point Garrison was unaware that Phelan was hostile. Phelan told Kirkwood how Garrison provided him a number of key documents, in confidence, which he was supposed to return the next morning. According to Kirkwood's transcription, here is what Phelan said: \"When [Garrison] gave them [the documents] to me he did not put any restrictions on them. He knew I was writing a piece. He said, 'You'll now understand my case when you read them.\" So I got up early and made a call to Bob Mayhew at the Desert Inn and told him I needed a Xerox and needed it fast. I had to have two documents Xeroxed and I did not want anyone else re ading them or knowing they were being copied. They Xeroxed the copies for me and I returned the originals to Garrison and made no comment about the thing. I wanted to wait for the trial.\" 705 What is significant, particularly in the context of the time in which Kirkwood first published this interview (1968) is this: it was not until some years later that it first came to light that it was former FBI man - turned - CIA contract agent Robert Maheu who was the primary intermediary between the CIA and organized cri me in the joint plotting against Fidel Castro. When Kirkwood first revealed the Phelan - Maheu machinations, Maheu's behind - the - scenes activities were still a deep, dark secret."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"[258] Final Judgment 319 It was this same Robert Maheu (misspelled as \"Mayhew\" by Kirkwood) who was ass isting Phelan in the attempt to scuttle the Garrison investigation — an investigation that would, if pursued to the ultimate, have exposed the very CIA - organized crime conspiracy against Castro that also implicated many of those involved in the JFK assassina tion itself. In Chapter 11 we examined Maheu's involvement with the CIA and such organized crime figures as Johnny Rosselli, Sam Giancana and Meyer Lansky lieutenant Santo Trafficante in detail. It will also be recalled that the aforementioned Desert Inn ( by this time the property of billionaire Howard Hughes) was initially established by Meyer Lansky's trusted associate, Morris Dalitz, whose activities and strange connections we examined in Chapter 10 and Chapter 15. So it was that the CIA did have its col laborators in key positions to undermine the Jim Garrison investigation. GARRISON & MARCELLO Some of Garrison's more creative foes in the media cleverly came up with a new way to discredit the New Orleans prosecutor. Instead of really seeking the truth a bout the JFK murder, they said, Garrison was, in fact, trying to cover it up. Garrison — so they said — was a willing tool of Mafia chieftain Carlos Marcello. By pointing his finger in the direction of the CIA, the Garrison critics claimed, the D.A. was trying to take the heat of suspicion off Carlos Marcello who, they said, was the more likely suspect. This claim is illogical at best. If Garrison were deliberately trying to cover up any Marcello connections — if any — to the assassination conspiracy, he was going about it in the wrong way. (It was in Chapter 10 where we learned of the campaign against Garrison led by Life magazine's Richard Billings, who promoted the Garrison - Marcello scenario. It was Billings, of course, who later served as a top advisor to the Ho use Assassinations Committee which pointed the finger of blame for the JFK assassination on \"The Mafia,\" — and Marcello in particular. ) If Garrison was trying to protect Marcello, the last person that he should have picked on was David Ferrie, the Mafia kin gpin's sometime - personal pilot and occasional legal researcher. Ferrie himself was standing alongside Marcello in a federal courtroom in New Orleans at the very moment JFK was shot. By first inquiring into Ferrie's activities, Garrison was practically walk ing right into Marcello's office itself. This fact alone nullifies the creative (but very much flawed) \"Mafia cover - up\" critique of Garrison that continues to hang over Garrison's memory to this day. Yet, those who push the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JF K\" ignore this fact. Evidently the people of New Orleans didn't buy the Establishment's heavy - handed assault on Garrison. He won re - election to the district attorney's office, despite — or perhaps precisely because of — the media"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"320 They Dare Not Speak Out [259] barrage. This is all the mor e remarkable in that it was the very newspapers of New Orleans who were Garrison's fiercest at - home critics. Garrison clearly was on the right track. He was looking in the right places. It was Garrison who linked Clay Shaw to the JFK assassination conspira cy and it was Shaw who sat on the board of Permindex, the shadowy Israeli Mossad - linked entity that played so central a role in the murder of the American president. How much Shaw knew about the impending murder of the president will never be known, but th ere is no question that Shaw was tied to the core of the conspiracy. THE FEDS VERSUS GARRISON No wonder then that the full force of the federal government came down on Garrison's head. He was hit with a wholly - concocted indictment on bribery charges but subsequently — and rightly — was acquitted. The key witness against him, a former friend named Pershing Gervais, admitted in a press interview (with journalist Rosemary James, herself a Garrison critic) that the charges against Garrison were a Justice Departme nt concoction. Gervais said, \"They wanted to silence Jim Garrison. That was their primary objective . . .\" It was, according to Gervais, \"a total, complete political frame - up, absolutely.\" He said \"the entire thing\" was a whole lie. 706 Despite the vindicat ion, the Internal Revenue Service jumped into the picture and brought a tax evasion indictment against Garrison for not paying taxes on the alleged bribes that he had been acquitted of having accepted. This, of course, seems incredible, but it is absolutel y true. Garrison beat that charge, but his Establishment critics continue to allege (in a last desperate effort to pummel Garrison) that the jurors in that case — as in the previous case — may have been bribed to bring in a not guilty verdict. THE MEDIA TRASH ES THE KENNEDY IMAGE What's more, thanks to the media, the image of John F. Kennedy likewise has been repeatedly savaged in the years following the assassination. It virtually became a form of ritual defamation. Kennedy's reputed sex life became the subje ct matter not of just the tabloids, but of the Establishment press itself. Kennedy, we were told, was not all that he was cracked up to be. His affair with Marilyn Monroe became the subject of conversation at every dinner table. (The strange role of Meyer Lansky's man in Hollywood, Mickey Cohen, in the Kennedy - Monroe liaison — which we examined in Chapter 13 — however, was not a staple of the continuing coverage.) The antics of John Kennedy's brother Edward did little to help things. The media eagerly pounced o n the Massachusetts senator's every mistake and — as the 30th anniversary of the JFK assassination approached in 1993 — began hyping several malicious books attacking Ted Kennedy with what many people might accurately assume was the purpose of preventing the y oungest Kennedy brother from ever reaching the White House."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"[260] Final Judgment 321 Even the late Jacqueline Kennedy — subsequently married to Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis — was held up to ridicule by the media in subsequent years. Not even she was free from the media's defa mation. THE HUNT - CIA CONNECTION SUPPRESSED Despite all the media's fascination with the Kennedy family, the media was strangely silent about the astounding revelations that came forth in the E. Howard Hunt - Spotlight newspaper libel trial in Miami in 1985 . It was then, as we saw in Chapter 16, that the jury concluded that the CIA had indeed played a part in John F. Kennedy's assassination. However, the CIA's friends at The Washington Post had barely a word to say about Hunt's stunning loss during the trial . Was this by accident — or by design? At this juncture the conclusion is all too obvious. THE CIA AND THE MEDIA That the CIA, of course, has had a major role in subverting the First Amendment and influencing the American media is now a widely accepted tru th. According to David Wise, writing in The American Police State, which examined, in part, the role of the CIA in manipulating the media: \"The CIA's contacts with the publishing world were not confined to attempts to suppress books. Through the U.S. Infor mation Agency as a `cut - out,' the CIA subsidized major publishers to produce books, some of which were then sold in the United States bearing no government imprint to warn the unsuspecting purchaser. \"In 1967 publisher Frederick A. Praeger conceded he had published `fifteen or sixteen' books for the CIA. By the mid - sixties, more than $1 million had been spent by the government on its 'book development' program. The Senate intelligence committee estimated that by 1967, the CIA had produced, sponsored, or sub sidized 'well over 1,000' books' here and abroad.\" 707 (One of Praeger's volumes is interesting in light of the \"French connection\" to the JFK case. In 1989 Praeger issued Challenging DeGaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria. Former CIA Direc tor William Colby wrote the introduction to Harrison's book which was described as the first fully documented history of the OAS.) Wise continues: \"The CIA also planted stories in the foreign press, some of which were played back to American audiences. [CI A Director William] Colby assured the House intelligence committee that the CIA would never manipulate [the Associated Press], since it was an American wire service. In addition, the CIA operated two news services of its own in Europe. These 'proprietaries ,' or CIA cover companies, serviced American newspapers; one had more than thirty U.S. subscribers.\" 708 However, there is one other significant force in American life which plays an even bigger part in shaping the media."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"322 They Dare Not Speak Out [261] ISRAEL AND TH E AM ERICAN M EDIA T he real key to understanding the media's part in the JFK assassination cover - up is to recognize the incredible influence of the Israeli lobby in the United States on the American media. It is a subject that deserves far more consideration than we can provi de in these pages. However, there are four volumes in particular which give the reader an in - depth look at the way Israel and its lobby in this country have had such a powerful impact on the way news relating to Israel is reported. Each volume deserves car eful study:   Split Vision: The Portrayal of Arabs in the American Media, edited by Edmund Ghareeb, published in 1983 by the American - Arab Affairs Council;   They Dare to Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel's Lobby by former Congressman Paul Fin dley, published in 1985 by Lawrence Hill & Company.   A Changing Image: American Perceptions of the Arab - Israeli Dispute by former diplomat Richard H. Curtiss, published in 1986 by the American Educational Trust;   Conspiracy Against Freedom, issued in 1986 by Liberty Lobby, the Washington - based populist institution which publishes The Spotlight, the newspaper that sparked the lawsuit by E. Howard Hunt (described in Chapter 16) which resulted in a jury's finding that the CIA had been complicit in the JFK assass ination conspiracy. This volume is of particular interest in that it displays documents from ADL files which prove the role of the pro - Israel Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith in seeking to silence critics of Israel through wide - ranging techniqu es including threats, economic boycott and other unsavory and illegal measures contrary to American tradition. It is the activity of the ADL, in particular, which seems to have had a recurring role in the JFK assassination conspiracy cover - up by the media. THE MOSSAD'S TENTACLES Intelligence historian Richard Deacon, writing in his history of Israel's Mossad, has commented on the pervasive role of the Israeli lobby and the manner in which it has exercised its influence: \"For years the tentacles of the Isr aeli Secret Service had reached out into all walks of American life, not in any sinister way, as was sometimes alleged by her enemies, but in a quietly persistent manner which embraced making friends and influencing people, establishing opinion lobbies and gathering intelligence. Deacon continued: \"This influence extended into the U.S. [House] and the Senate, the Pentagon, the defense and electronic industries, the research laboratories and such Jewish - oriented organizations as the Anti - Defamation League, t he Jewish Defense Committee, Bonds for Israel and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"[262] Final Judgment 323 \"Some of these bodies have served as fronts for intelligence - gathering and there are few of the important congressional committees which do not possess one member or staff - assistant who does not feed the Israeli network relevant material.\" 709 THE ANTI - DEFAMATION LEAGUE It is significant that Deacon has made specific reference to the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith. Perhaps above any other organizatio n, it is the ADL which has consistently had a major impact on the America media. And in the case of the media's coverage of the JFK assassination, the Warren Commission investigation, and the subsequent critiques of the commission, the ADL's fine hand is, as we shall see, quite visible. That the ADL, as a voice for Israel, would have an interest in stifling any suggestion that Israel — and for that matter, Israel's allies at the CIA — had a hand in the JFK assassination cannot be disputed. After all, the ADL ha s adopted as its mission the defense of Israel and the defamation of its critics — both real and perceived. THE ADL AND THE LANSKY SYNDICATE What's more, the ADL has — to this day — very close ties to the remnants of the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and has throughout its history. Many top Lansky associates were longtime high - level financial backers of the ADL. According to a 1968 study by Father Dan Lyons, a Jesuit priest, at that time fully $5,500,000 of the ADL's total budget of $6,183,000 came fro m contributions from the liquor industry. The liquor industry was a virtual fiefdom of powerful Jewish families known for their devotion to Israel, most notably the family of ex - bootlegger Samuel Bronfman. 710 (As we saw in Chapters 7 and 15, the Bronfman family — along with liquor baron Sam Rothberg, head of the U.S. Israel Bonds campaign, were key backers of Israel and tied closely with the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate.) In fact, as we noted in Chapter 10, the ADL is so close to the Lansky Syndicate tha t in 1983 Lansky's longtime associate, Morris Dalitz, was honored by the ADL with its prestigious annual \"Torch of Liberty Award.\" (Dalitz's service to the cause of Israel was apparently deemed more significant than his activities in the underworld.) All o f this is, of course, significant when we consider the ADL's activities in the context of the media's assault on those who ponder the possibility of a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. However, the ADL has — as we shall see — connections above and beyon d the organized crime interests that stood to benefit from the JFK assassination. The ADL has long - standing ties to American intelligence."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"324 They Dare Not Speak Out [263] THE ADL & AM ERICAN INTELLIGENCE Writing in American Jewish Organizations and Israel, Lee O'Brien provides an infor mative capsule study of the ADL's method of operation: \"In its early decades, the ADL would approach persons or institutions considered to be anti - Semitic and privately attempt to persuade or reason them into retracting abusive statements and correcting of fensive behavior. \"In later years, ADL has turned to more public and aggressive measures, which it classifies as \"Educational,\" \"Vigilance Work,\" and \"Legislation.\" In fact, \"Vigilance Work\" has become outright surveillance of individuals and groups, the r esults of which are fed into both the Israeli intelligence - gathering apparatus, via their consulates and embassy, and American domestic intelligence, via the FBI. To ADL officials have admitted the use of clandestine surveillance techniques.\" 711 THE ADL AND THE M EDIA O'Brien's summary of the ADL's method of operation is quite interesting in that it pinpoints the ADL's influence on the media and on public debate over the role of Israel vis - à - vis American Middle East policy making: \"Today the ADL is much m ore active than other community relations organizations in the use of its regional offices and constituency for information gathering, and dissemination. \"The central headquarters in New York City provides regional offices with analysis sheets, sample lett ers to the editor to be placed in local media, biographies of Israeli leaders and anti - Zionist speakers, and directives on how to deal with topical issues. \"The regional offices in turn monitor all Israel - related or Middle East - related activities in their areas, such as the media, campus speakers, and films. By bringing the local events to the attention of the central headquarters, they play a pivotal role in ADL's overall supervision of the national scene.\" 712 OPERATING AGAINST ISRAEL'S CRITICS O'Brien describes one instance which is typical of the ADL's activities in defense of Israel: \"One Jewish activist critical of Israeli policies discovered in 1983 that the ADL maintained a file on him going back to 1970; it included information on the subject gath ered from local newspapers, talks on campuses, interoffice memos (from the institution where the subject teaches), business meetings, talk on radio and TV, and press and other miscellaneous materials. \"As the file revealed, specific individuals had been as signed to monitor this person's lectures, either by tape recordings and verbatim transcriptions, or by detailed summaries of what the subject spoke about, the context of the"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"[264] Final Judgment 325 lecture, other participants, size of audience, questions from the floor, mood of the audience, and so forth. \"In some cases, these observers successfully penetrated closed meetings in which the subject participated. Subsequently, the ADL prepared and disseminated a short primer on this person, following the 'myth\" and \"fact' format, a nd distributed it to their agents for use at future speaking engagements.\" 713 This, of course, is but one example (of many) which demonstrates the pervasive influence of Israel's ADL and its clandestine efforts to control public discussion of U.S. Middle East policy on all fronts — particularly in the American media. SPY SCANDAL At the beginning of 1993, however, the ADL's history of covert — and illegal — domestic spying finally became the topic of widespread public controversy. A spy scandal erupted in San F rancisco, enveloping the ADL, one of its longtime paid informants, and a San Francisco police officer who had been selling classified police intelligence information to the ADL. A raid by the San Francisco Police Department on the offices of the ADL in bot h San Francisco and Los Angeles revealed that those offices of the ADL were maintaining surveillance on some 12,000 individual Americans and on the activities of some 950 social and political organizations of all political persuasions. It was subsequently revealed that the ADL was conducting similar spying operations in other major cities around the country, utilizing a network of paid informants who were charged with the responsibility of infiltrating organizations targeted by the ADL. (In Chapter 15 we co nsidered the likelihood that the ADL's New Orleans spymaster, A. L. (Bee) Botnick, had utilized the good offices of his fellow anti - communist extremist, ex - FBI man, private detective and CIA asset Guy Banister, to spy upon left wing groups in New Orleans, taking advantage of the talents of a young man named Lee Harvey Oswald.) Ironically, among the targets of the ADL's spying included organizations that had, over the years, cooperated with the ADL in a number of joint ventures, including the National Associ ation for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. SPYING ON EVERYBODY Contrary to popular perception, the ADL was not spying only on so - called \"right wing\" or \"anti - Semitic\" groups. Instead, the ADL appears to have maint ained constant surveillance of a wide variety of groups and individuals. Although the ADL sought to maintain silence about the ongoing investigation, hard - hitting and fact - filled investigative reports by the San"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"326 They Dare Not Speak Out [265] Francisco Examiner and the Los Angeles Tim es, in particular, received nationwide distribution, doing immense damage to the ADL's long - standing pose as a \"civil rights\" organization. THE ANGLETON CONNECTION The longtime chief of the ADL's spy network (euphemistically called its \"fact finding divi sion\") was one Irwin Suall who operated out of ADL headquarters in Manhattan. Formerly active in the labor movement, Suall was a protégé of Jay Lovestone, whom we first met in Chapter 8. Suall's mentor, it will be recalled, was Mossad - allied CIA spymaster James J. Angleton's point man in the CIA's dealings with the Lansky Syndicate - linked Corsican and Sicilian crime organizations. These foreign crime elements (which handled the Lansky - run drug racket in Europe) were also utilized by the CIA in its campaign against left - wing labor movements in the Mediterranean during the post - war period. Since James J. Angleton was dismissed from his CIA post after revelations of his involvement in illegal domestic spying by the CIA, we cannot help but speculate that, in lig ht of revelations about ADL spying, Angleton almost certainly relied upon the good offices of his friends at the Mossad - linked ADL for much information. (In Chapter 15 we pointed out that the FBI also utilized the ADL as a spy asset, noting, in particular the ADL's spying operations aimed at civil rights leader, Martin Luther King, Jr.) THE ADL AND THE JFK ASSASSINATION That the ADL would have a hand in shaping JFK assassination news coverage was inevitable, particularly in light of the revelations we hav e put forth in the pages of this volume. In fact, on the first occasion when the Establishment media put forth a theory that perhaps Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed part of a much bigger conspiracy, it was in a news story leaked by two major columnists who we re very close to not only the ADL but also to key figures in the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate. The case study we are about to examine is highly significant and illustrates the point all too well. THE PEARSON/ANDERSON COVER STORY On March 3, 1967, syndica ted columnist Drew Pearson and his understudy, Jack Anderson, floated a story which suggested that Fidel Castro had been behind the JFK murder. (This column appeared during the time that New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison was in the earliest stages of his own controversial assassination inquiry.) Interestingly, Pearson and Anderson even slanted their column to suggest that somehow then - Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the president's younger brother who was elected to the Senate from New York in"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"[266] Final Judgment 327 1 964, had a hand in setting what became the alleged Castro - sponsored assassination plot in motion. Pearson and Anderson claimed that: \"President Johnson is sitting on a political H - bomb, an unconfirmed report that Sen. Robert Kennedy may have approved an as sassination plot which then possibly backfired against his late brother.\" The assassination plot alleged was one of those hatched between the CIA and \"the Mafia.\" 714 According to what can most charitably be described as the fanciful account by Pearson and Anderson, Castro had captured a number of CIA - Mafia hit men who were gunning for him and then \"turned\" them; in short, that the anti - Castro hit men then had a change of heart and returned to the United States and killed Kennedy. It was some years later th at Anderson revealed that Mafia figure Johnny Rosselli had, in fact, been the alleged initial source of the story which Anderson said had been told to CIA - linked Washington lawyer, Edward P. Morgan. (In Chapter 11 we reviewed Rosselli's involvement in the Castro assassination plots upon which the Pearson/Anderson story relied, in part, as a basis for its theory.) WHY THE COVER STORY DOESN'T WASH . . . With good reasons which they cite, Rosselli's biographers, Charles Rappleye and Ed Becker, don't believe the Pearson/Anderson story in the least. They write: \"Not mentioned in the column was the simple, powerful argument against Cuban sponsorship of the Kennedy assassination — the powerful risk Castro would run if a plot against the American president was disco vered. As the [U.S. Senate's] Church Committee [investigating CIA assassination plots] noted, such a blunder would have 'exposed Cuba to invasion and destruction.' \"Later, it was learned that Castro had opened new channels of diplomacy, at the time of the shooting in Dallas, showing himself, in the words of one diplomat, 'anxious to establish communications with the United States.' Finally, with the benefit of hindsight, Rosselli's story of CIA marksmen being 'turned' seems highly implausible, a product of Korean War recruiting films. \"Nor did Anderson note his own close relationship to his source; that Morgan had no evidence, beyond Rosselli's statements, to back up the Castro retaliation theory; nor that Rosselli may have been pursuing his own, independent agenda.\" 715 Mafia enforcer and one - time \"acting boss\" of the Mafia families in California, Jimmy Fratianno, told of a meeting with Rosselli in 1976, around the time that Rosselli was providing congressional investigators with details of CIA - Organized Cri me assassination plots aimed at Fidel Castro."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"328 They Dare Not Speak Out [267] Fratianno's memory of the event suggests that Rosselli himself was never being straightforward about the events as they had really unfolded. Fratianno recalls Rosselli's words as follows: \"They had me up at t he Carroll Arms Hotel . . . for a secret session and I really fixed their fucking wagon. All hot, you know, about who killed Kennedy. Sometimes I'd like to tell them the mob did it, just to see the expression on their stupid faces. You know, we're supposed to be idiots, right? \"We hire a psycho like Oswald to kill the President and then we get a blabbermouth, two - bit punk like Ruby to shut him up. We wouldn't trust those jerks to hit a fucking dog. \"Anyway, they start questioning me about this bullshit I'd told Morgan years ago. You know, Castro retaliating against Kennedy because of our attempts on his life. I said, 'I have no recollection of receiving or passing on such information.' \"Well, Jimmy, it's not my fault if Morgan has a vivid imagination. I've a lso been dropping by Jack Anderson's office and we're getting pretty chummy, having lunch and dinner together. Nice guy, but he's always trying to pump me, but he's cool about it.\" 716 THE CIA CONNECTION Rosselli's biographers believe that \"more intrigui ng than Rosselli's motivation [in creating the story told by Pearson and Anderson] is the question of who actually sponsored the bogus lead that Castro killed Kennedy.\" 717 According to Rappleye and Becker, \"Santo Trafficante seems the most likely party.\" 718 They go even further, however. They believe that the CIA was behind Trafficante's actions in this regard: \"Might the CIA have floated the Castro theory, again to deflect the [Jim] Garrison investigation [in New Orleans]? If the CIA were actually involv ed in the Kennedy assassination, as some leading researchers believe, the scenario would fit. \"Considering his intimate association with the Agency, Rosselli would have accepted their directive as well as Trafficante's. And Ed Morgan himself had close ties to the Agency, both through [CIA contract operative Robert] Maheu and from a prior stint as counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\" 719 (As we saw, particularly in Chapter 12, Trafficante was not the major crime boss he has been portrayed by t he Establishment media. Instead, he was the immediate deputy of the CIA's longtime collaborator — and Israel's loyalist — Meyer Lansky.) PEARSON, JOHNSON & THE LANSKY SYNDICATE Warren Commission critic, Peter Dale Scott notes, additionally, that Pearson, him self, was close to then - President Lyndon B. Johnson and that"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"[268] Final Judgment 329 Pearson was backing Johnson's CIA - backed plans to expand the war in Vietnam (the issue over which JFK and the CIA had been at loggerheads leading to a final showdown). 720 Floating an anti - comm unist story (i.e. linking a communist dictator to the murder of the martyred president) then, would also have the side effect of whipping up anti - communist hysteria which would have been helpful to the \"anti - communist\" offensive in Vietnam that proved so b eneficial, as we have seen, not only to the CIA, but also to the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate and its allies in Israel. The Pearson - Johnson relationship had other implications as well. According to Scott, Pearson had used his column to leak government info rmation about a key witness, one Don Reynolds, who was providing evidence against Johnson's longtime crony and reputed bag - man, Bobby Baker.\" 721 (Baker, as we saw, in Chapter 6, was not only an independent operator on his own, but a front man for a variet y of LBJ's corrupt business ventures. Baker conducted more than a few deals with close associates of Meyer Lansky, most notably Ed Levinson, a director of Mossad operative Tibor Rosenbaum's Banque de Credit International (BCI). (As we noted in Chapter 15, Rosenbaum's BCI, of course, was one of the chief shareholders in Permindex, the shadowy entity that played so central a role in the CIA - Mossad conspiracy against John F. Kennedy.) EARL WARREN CONNED Drew Pearson's own interest in JFK assassination cover stories was of long standing. In fact, according to Scott's research, it was Pearson himself who told Chief Justice Earl Warren, early in the Warren Commission investigation, that the CIA - Organized Crime plots against Castro had backfired and that Castro h ad retaliated and ordered the assassination of Kennedy? 722 According to Pearson's own longtime legman, John Henshaw, Warren and Pearson had traveled together to the USSR shortly after the JFK assassination. There Pearson was introduced to Soviet leader N ikita Khrushchev. Apparently one of the subjects discussed by Pearson and Khrushchev was the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 723 Henshaw noted that a \"top secret\" classified document buried in the National Archives in Washington (signed by CIA Director R ichard Helms) was designated, \"Discussion between Chairman Khrushchev and Mr. Drew Pearson regarding Lee Harvey Oswald.\" 724 This was one of the documents that Chief Justice Warren ordered sealed for 75 years. The secret talks between Pearson and the Sovi et dictator were never recorded in Pearson's gossip column. It was apparently during this period that Pearson first promoted the Castro conspiracy theory which later came to the public's attention in 1967. However, at the time of the Warren Commission inve stigation, the chief justice evidently believed there was a basis for Pearson's story, and"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"330 They Dare Not Speak Out [269] thus a consequent need to cover up the truth to prevent the outbreak of war. This apparently was the ruse needed to convince Warren to hide what he mistakenly belie ved to be the troublesome truth. Pearson's biographer charitably described the columnist's actions: \"The purpose of the columnist - turned - diplomat was to reduce hysteria, which might upset the delicate balance between the [United States and the USSR].\" 725 Whatever the case, the Pearson - Anderson story about the alleged Castro conspiracy against JFK created a sensation and muddied the waters at a time when JFK assassination conspiracy allegations were gaining widespread credibility. However rational the story may have sounded at the time, the evidence was flimsy at best as we have seen. The fact is that the Pearson - Anderson \"revelations\" are nothing more than deliberate disinformation. SHIFTING THE FOCUS OF CONTROVERSY The Pearson - Anderson columns, in effect , \"cleared\" the CIA of involvement in JFK's murder and pointed the finger at Castro. The Pearson - Anderson columns, likewise, shifted focus away from the Garrison investigation in New Orleans which was focusing on likely CIA involvement and which had stumbl ed upon the Clay Shaw - Permindex connection bringing the inquiry right onto Israel's doorstep. That Drew Pearson, in particular, would have an interest in shielding any Israeli involvement as well is beyond doubt. ISRAEL'S FAVORITE COLUMNIST Of Jewish ext raction, Pearson was a devoted friend of Israel — from the beginning. In fact, in the period leading up to the establishment of the state of Israel, Pearson functioned as a hit man for the Israeli lobby in the United States, pounding away in his column at t hose perceived inimical to Israeli interests. One of Pearson's favorite targets was then - Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. According to Pearson's biographer, \"When Forrestal persuaded [President Harry] Truman to take the Arab side against the Jews in P alestine for military reasons, Pearson saw his opportunity. He lathered and shaved Forrestal as a bureaucratic voice for American oil companies with enormous stakes in the Mideast. Walter Winchell and other opinion - makers supported his position.\" 726 Pears on's hysterical media attack on Forrestal, some believed, led to the Cabinet secretary's mental instability, resulting in Forrestal's suicide. There a r e m a n y , t h o u g h , w h o b e l i e v e t h a t F o r r e s t a l w a s i n f a c t murdered — precisely because of his powerful opposit ion to the Israeli lobby. Pearson himself had cemented his ties with the Israeli lobby and had engaged in behind - the - scenes intrigue with Israel's intelligence and propaganda arm, the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith for decades."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"[270] Final Judgment 331 PEARSON AND THE ADL According to Pearson's biographer, \"Over the years the ADL had helped Pearson enormously. It had provided information he could not obtain elsewhere, backed his lecture tours, even assisted in the circulation of his weekly newsletter.\" 727 Pearson' s own former mother - in - law, Washington Times - Herald publisher Cissy Patterson, was less charitable in her description of Pearson. In a fiery editorial attack on Pearson she called him \"both undercover agent and mouthpiece for the Anti - Defamation League.\" 7 28 What's more, Pearson had a long - standing arrangement with the ADL in which the ADL paid the expenses of his legmen, such as the aforementioned John Henshaw, in return for Pearson floating ADL propaganda in his columns. 729 PEARSON'S MOSSAD CONNECTION Pearson, likewise, had acquainted himself over the years with a number of top - level intelligence operatives close to Israel, in particular, Canadian - born British intelligence wizard, Sir William Stephenson. Stephenson, as we saw in Chapter 7 and Chapter 15 was not only the guiding force behind the assembly of Israel's Mossad, but also the brains behind the Allied intelligence operations during World War II which utilized the resources of Meyer Lansky and his organized crime network. He was also a close as sociate and mentor of Louis M. Bloomfield, president of the Mossad - backed Permindex entity that was central to the JFK assassination conspiracy. According to Pearson's biographer, \"Stephenson had become acquainted during the war with Pearson as a responsib le publicist with the largest serious following in the United States.\" 730 In at least one instance, Pearson published a story that, according to his biographer, \"was spoon - fed to him\" 731 by Stephenson. Pearson's other connections were equally interesti ng and point further toward his interest in covering for Israel and its allies in the JFK assassination conspiracy — both the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. THE ISRAELI LOBBY AND PEARSON According to Pearson's associate, John Henshaw, Pearson was engaged in sharp business practices with his partner, attorney Max M. Kampelman, a key figure in the Israel lobby in Washington and a longtime top - level Anti - Defamation League (ADL) director. Kampelman, the personal attorney for then - Vice Presi dent Hubert Humphrey, and Pearson were trying to wrest control of television channel 14 away from a Black - owned station, WOOK, in Washington. 732"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"332 They Dare Not Speak Out [271] (In Chapter 6, as we have seen, Humphrey was a product of a Minnesota political machine funded, in part, by the notorious Isadore Blumenfeld, a major cog in the Lansky Crime Syndicate.) The connections between Pearson and the Israeli lobby in Washington were even more intimate. Pearson's stepson (and the editor of his \"diaries\"), Tyler Abell, an attorney, had b een employed by the law firm of David Ginsburg, a registered foreign agent for Israel. Ginsburg, like several other top figures known for their interest in promoting Israel's interests in Washington, were among those close to Hubert Humphrey. (Ginsburg him self took a leave of absence from his own firm to work on behalf of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign.) 733 In Chapter 6, of course, we examined the vice president's early political successes in Lansky Syndicate - dom inated Minneapolis. THE MICKEY COHEN DEAL In 1968 Pearson worked hand - in - glove with Meyer Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, in an effort to wreck Richard Nixon's presidential campaign in favor of his Democratic opponent, Humphrey. (It was in Ch apter 13 where we explored Cohen's connection to the JFK assassination conspiracy in some detail.) According to Cohen, writing in his memoirs, President Johnson arranged for Pearson to call Cohen who was, by then, in jail. Pearson wanted to uncover dirt ab out Nixon from the former Vice President's days in California when, according to Cohen, he had provided underworld financial backing for Nixon. \"We're going for Humphrey for president,\" Pearson told Cohen, \"And I assure you that if he becomes our president , you're going to be given a medical parole,\" in return for providing muck against Nixon. According to Cohen, \"I consented to everything that Pearson wanted to do against Nixon.\" 734 However, Nixon won the election and Cohen never received his medical par ole. Pearson's relationship with the publishers of the National Enquirer newspaper (which has made a specialty out of trashing the Kennedy family and likewise publishing often loony JFK assassination conspiracy stories) is also interesting, particularly in light of the Enquirer's CIA and Israeli lobby connections. PEARSON AND THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER As reported by Pearson's legman, John Henshaw, in the July 1, 1969 issue of the Washington Observer newsletter, the company which published the Enquirer, World Wide Features, Inc. had interesting origins. It was owned by the three brothers, Anthony, Fortune and Generoso Pope. They were the sons of Generoso Pope, Sr., an Italian leader of New"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"[272] Final Judgment 333 York City's Tammany Hall political machine which was itself inextricab ly tied to the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. The Pope family were longtime contributors — through the Generoso Pope Foundation — to pro - Israel causes. The foundation was also widely suspected of being a secret conduit for CIA funds. Generoso Pope, Jr . owned the National Enquirer. Pope, Jr. had worked for the CIA during the Korean war and was himself famously friendly with Lansky's longtime partner, Frank Costello. In fact, Costello helped finance the Enquirer in its infancy. 735 Pearson had given high ly favorable publicity to Generoso Pope, Sr. as the first \"prominent Italian American\" to oppose Mussolini. In return, Pope promptly gave Pearson a contract to write a weekly column for his El Progresso, the leading Italian language newspaper in the countr y. The $150 - a - week contract was more than any other newspaper paid for just one weekly column. In the mid - 1960's Pearson and Fortune Pope, along with Lyndon Johnson's TV - and - radio advisor, Leonard Marks, went into partnership and acquired the Bell - McClure Syndicate and the North American Newspaper Alliance. (Marks was later appointed head of the U.S. Information Agency by Johnson.) 736 Pearson's biographer dismisses the relationship between Pearson and the controversial Pope family as \"puzzling.\" 737 This relationship, however, further cements Pearson's ties to the Israeli lobby and its allies in the CIA. THE JOE TRENTO CONNECTION It is of more than passing interest to note that for a period, Generoso Pope's Washington bureau chief was journalist Joe Tren to, who emerged as an authority on the intelligence community. It was Trento, as we saw in Chapter 16, who co - wrote a controversial article alleging that former CIA man E. Howard Hunt may have been in Dallas on the day JFK was shot. Trento, as noted, had e xcellent CIA connections — James Jesus Angleton, in particular, and we know for a fact that Trento was being used as a media conduit by Angleton for whatever insidious purposes of his own. This, of course, we discussed in some detail in Chapter 16. JACK AND ERSON'S CONNECTIONS Drew Pearson's partner and protégé, Jack Anderson, himself had notable ties to not only the Israeli lobby, but also the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate. Not only did Anderson once share his offices with at least one registered lobbyis t for Israel, who was also close to Lansky's protégé, Carlos Marcello, 738 but he also maintained a close working relationship with Herman (Hank) Greenspun, a longtime Lansky syndicate associate and arms - smuggler for Israel."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"334 They Dare Not Speak Out [273] Greenspun was a protégé of L ansky crony Joseph \"Doc\" Stacher, a New Jersey mobster who was one of the prime American backers of the Jewish underground in Palestine in the late 1940's. 739 Stacher was later permitted to go into exile in Israel following his conviction in the United St ates on income tax evasion charges. According to Lansky's friendly biographer, Robert Lacey, Stacher's death affected Lansky greatly. They were very close friends and longtime associates.) 740 Greenspun also functioned as a public relations man for Lansky 's boyhood friend — later killed at Lansky's direction — Benjamin Siegel. According to The Washington Observer, \"Early in the Palestine War, Hank Greenspun was dispatched by the Jewish underground to Hawaii to buy surplus U.S. Army arms and equipment. By bribi ng security guards at the U.S. Naval Air Station on Oahu, he raided a stockpile of armaments and stole 15 tons of .30 - and .50 - caliber aircraft machine guns. The contraband machine guns were packed in 58 crates marked 'engine parts' and shipped to Los Ang eles, then transshipped to Mexico and on to Israel. Greenspun ran the British blockade in a ship delivering arms to Israel. Later he pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Neutrality Act, and was given a 3 - year suspended sentence. He was never prosecuted for theft of Federal government property.\" 741 Greenspun, who became a major figure in Las Vegas, went on to establish a chain of newspapers in Nevada and Colorado, publishing The Las Vegas Sun. As we saw in Chapter 7, the Israeli arms - smuggling underworld of which Greenspun was a part, was a very tightly knit little clique. It was, of course, Louis Bloomfield (later chief executive officer of the Permindex entity) who was once a key coordinator for Israeli arms smuggling working with the Lansky Syndicate and, Anderson's associate, Greenspun. Anderson and Greenspun were themselves involved in yet another venture linked to the Lansky Syndicate. The two, along with CIA - linked attorney Edward Morgan (the alleged conduit for the Castro conspiracy story floated by P earson and Anderson) were middlemen in the sale of Lansky associate and ADL \"Torch of Liberty\" winner, Morris Dalitz's Las Vegas gambling palace, the Desert Inn, to Howard Hughes. 742 AND ONE LAST INTERESTING POINT: Jack Anderson was also a very public and longtime \"close friend\" 743 of Mossad and CIA asset Frank Sturgis, beginning as early as 1960 — three years before Sturgis, by his own reported later admission, played a part in the events in Dealey Plaza. A CASE STUDY IN DISINFORMATION That Drew Pearson a nd Jack Anderson maintained such intimate ties with all of the prime movers behind the JFK assassination — Israel, the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate — not only casts real doubt about the Castro assassination plot story that the two columni sts sensationalized, but it points toward the real motivation behind the release of the tale: to cover for the real conspirators."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"[274] Final Judgment 335 The case of Pearson and Anderson exemplifies, above all, the insidious nature of Israel's influence over the American media and provides a clear - cut case study of how the media has been manipulated to distort the truth about the JFK assassination conspiracy. Although the media in general had initially backed the Warren Commission cover - up, public dissent about the conclusions — s tirred on largely by the work of pioneer commission critic Mark Lane and his friend, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison — forced Israel's friends in the media to play their hand. Stories that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" and about \"Castro\" plots against JF K suddenly began emerging. Pearson and Anderson were just two players in the continuing cover - up. And Pearson himself (as we have seen) actually had a hand in convincing Earl Warren that there had been a conspiracy (plotted by Castro) that made it necessar y, for the public good, to cover up the truth. In fact, Pearson and his Israeli and CIA allies were seeking to keep the real truth hidden. MORE DISINFORMATION One rather interesting JFK assassination story appeared in the form of a book by former CIA con tract agent Hugh McDonald, co - written with prolific author Geoffrey Bocca. The McDonald - Bocca book, Appointment in Dallas, received wide distribution. The book featured an interview with an international hit man named \"Saul\" who confessed to McDonald that he was the real murderer of President Kennedy. The hit man said that he was hired by a private group, and not by the CIA for whom he had done contract work in the past. While many JFK assassination critics were highly skeptical about the book, looking upon it as some form of disinformation (perhaps from the CIA itself) — although not necessarily questioning McDonald's sincerity — it would have been more instructive to consider Geoffrey Bocca's role in the writing of the book. Bocca, in fact, was a propagandist for the CIA - backed and Israeli - financed French Secret Army Organization (OAS) and was known to have \"translated some OAS tracts into English at a time when the organization was thinking of appealing to the United Nations for help.\" 744 Bocca also wrote a heroic account of the OAS entitled The Secret Army. Needless to say, in light of the \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination conspiracy, the appearance of an OAS propagandist as the co - author of a book which effectively \"cleared\" the CIA of involvemen t in the crime is interesting, to say the least. An odd footnote: several years after publishing Appointment in Dallas, McDonald wrote another JFK assassination book. His co - author, who had solid links to the CIA, Robin Moore, was best known, interestingly enough, for his famous book, The French Connection — on the French intelligence - and Lansky Syndicate - linked international heroin racket. McDonald and Moore's book was entitled LBJ and the JFK Conspiracy. This volume elaborated on the theme of McDonald's fi rst book, saying that"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"336 They Dare Not Speak Out [275] the alleged hit man, Saul, had been hired by the Soviet Union to kill President Kennedy. The theory that the Soviets were behind the assassination conspiracy, of course, falls right in line with the CIA's initial scheme, through its Mexico City Scenario, concocted by James J. Angleton, to pin the crime on the KGB. Whatever the case, McDonald's second book received little, if any, recognition, although it did muddy the waters further. A PRO - ISRAEL 'CRITIC' The tell - tale hand of Isra eli sympathizers within even the ranks of the \"critics\" of the Warren Commission's conclusions has also now become apparent. When a group of self - styled Warren Commission \"critics\" formed an organization known as the Assassination Information Bureau, one o f them included liberal journalist Jack Newfield, a devout and outspoken supporter of Israel. THE `HOFFA KILLED JFK' COVER STORY In 1992, when public interest in the JFK assassination conspiracy was at a fever pitch as a result of the concurrent release of Mark Lane's best seller, Plausible Denial, and Oliver Stone's film, JFK, it was Newfield who floated yet another ridiculous JFK assassination conspiracy story — a new angle on the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" \"Hoffa had JKF killed\" screamed the hea dline on the front page of the January 14 edition of the sensationalist New York Post. It was the New York tabloid that \"broke\" the story that Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa had arranged the JFK murder through his Mafia contacts. Not surprisingly, the author of the Post article was Jack Newfield. The Post, of course, has been one of the media's primary pro - Israel voices — almost to the point of obsession. Any conspiracy that might somehow link Israel — or its allies in the CIA — could not be tolerated. Almost immediat ely, the rest of the Establishment media picked up the scandal sheet's \"exclusive\" and began hyping it. The purpose was to discredit the conspiracy that was finally being exposed to millions of Americans. In response to Newfield's concoction, even Dan Rath er, on CBS, felt compelled to tell the world that the evidence was in: longtime Teamsters' Union leader Jimmy Hoffa had ordered \"the Mafia\" to kill John F. Kennedy. The Washington Post, long a CIA disinformation source, also published the story. As did the staunchly pro - Israel conservative weekly, Human Events which consistently maintained, otherwise, that any conspiracy in the JFK assassination — particularly involving the CIA — was a madman's fantasy. Newfield's article quoted a longtime alleged associate of organized crime, attorney Frank Ragano, as having claimed that Teamster boss Jimmy"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"[276] Final Judgment 337 Hoffa told him to order \"the Mafia\" to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. According to Ragano's unlikely story, Ragano took the message to New Orleans rackets boss Car los Marcello and to Tampa mob chieftain Santos Trafficante, both of whom, we have seen, were immediate underlings of Meyer Lansky. Presumably they complied with Hoffa's order, in Ragano's version of the story, because, after all, Kennedy was indeed shot de ad. 745 However, as Mark Lane has commented, \"Hoffa didn't give orders to the Mafia. The Mafia gave orders to Hoffa.\" 746 WHY THE HOFFA STORY DOESN'T WASH Ragano's primary \"evidence\" that Trafficante was involved in JFK's murder was a comment made by Traf ficante to the effect that \"We should have killed Bobby,\" referring to then - Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Not that Trafficante admitted that \"we\" killed JFK — only that \"we should have killed Bobby.\" Now all of this is most peculiar in that Ragano say s that he — a top - level criminal lawyer with high - ranking connections — managed to \"suppress\" these memories until just recently. Ragano said he was \"guilty and ashamed\" because of his association with organized crime; according to Ragano, his guilt feelings c aused him to suppress those memories. However, he might also have been interested in adding some spice to his memoirs which were later published. What's more, Ragano, who was appealing a second federal income tax evasion conviction, might also have had som ething else in mind by telling this story which clears the CIA and any other federal agencies that may have been involved in the assassination and its cover - up. WHO KILLED HOFFA? Hoffa biographer Dan Moldea shed some interesting \"inside\" information rega rding the truth about Hoffa — and his murder. Moldea reports: \"Ironically enough, attorney William Bufalino . . . may have inadvertently pointed a finger in the right direction. He was attempting to suggest that the mob had nothing to do with Hoffa's murder, preferring to shift the blame on the government, but he put it this way: `Tell the FBI to look into the CIA. And tell the CIA to look into the FBI. Then you'll have the answer [to the Hoffa case.]' And he added that it was his belief that Hoffa's murder w as related to those of [Sam] Giancana and Johnny] Rosselli. 747 (In Chapter 11, of course, we examined the strange deaths of Sam Giancana and Johnny Rosselli and concluded, contrary to popular myth, that the two Mafia figures were not, in fact, the victim s of \"Mafia\" hits at all — but were, instead, snuffed out if not by the CIA itself, certainly at its behest.)"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"338 They Dare Not Speak Out [277] Interestingly enough, it was yet another dedicated pro - Israel polemicist, Max Lerner, writing in The Washington Times, who also came to the defens e of the Hoffa - Mafia cover story. According to Lerner, \"The Mafia has always figured among the major possible scenarios for the killing, along with the KGB and Cuba's Fidel Castro. But not until the Ragano account had the pieces of the puzzle begun to fall together. Marcello headed the Mafia operation in New Orleans, Trafficante in Tampa and Cuba. They had time to work out their plan. They had an army of skilled killers to draw on. \" 7 4 8 Lerner, of course, was playing fast and loose with the facts. He ignored the central part Meyer Lansky played in manipulating the activities of both Marcello and Trafficante. SUN MYUNG MOON, ISRAEL & THE CIA That The Washington Times would have an interest in promoting the Hoffa - Mafia story is no surprise. After all, the Tim es itself has close links to the intelligence community and is a strident editorial supporter of Israel. The Washington Times is funded by the bizarre global conglomerate of Korean cult figure Sun Myung Moon. Moon himself has been repeatedly linked to the Korean CIA which is, of course, intimately tied with its American counterpart. Additionally, Moon has forged a close working alliance with Israel and its American lobby and has pushed a pro - Israel agenda on the so - called \"conservative movement\" in the Unit ed States. Moon's editor at The Washington Times at that time was Arnaud deBorchgrave, a former top correspondent for the CIA - linked Newsweek (owned by the Washington Post Company) and a reputed \"former\" intelligence operative. What's more, deBorchgrave hi mself is closely connected by marriage to the Rothschild family. The Rothschilds, as we have seen, have been longtime financial backers of the state of Israel. THE CONSERVATIVE COVER - UP The response to JFK conspiracy allegations from another \"conservativ e\" source is equally interesting. The organization, quaintly named Accuracy in Media, a self - styled conservative \"media watchdog,\" took great umbrage with suggestions that there might have been a conspiracy behind the president's assassination. At the time Mark Lane's Plausible Denial and Oliver Stone's JFK were released, AIM chairman Reed Irvine, seemingly inexplicably, signed on with the rest of the media in denouncing the conspiracy theories presented in the book and the motion picture. Writing in the pa ges of the conservative weekly, Human Events, media critic Irvine paid tribute to the Establishment media for its attack on the theories. According to Irvine, \"The mainstream media, to their credit, have"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"[278] Final Judgment 339 been nearly unanimous in denouncing Stone as a lyi ng charlatan.\" 749 (Although, of course, Stone did not, in fact, tell the whole truth.) Irvine went on to dismiss Lane as a \"leftist\" and announced emphatically that anyone who believes that there was any kind of domestic conspiracy behind the JFK murder w as being taken in by Soviet propaganda. The AIM response was interesting, particularly in the context of the background of some of AIM's leading lights. WHO'S BEHIND AIM? Irvine himself was a former economist for the big bank - controlled Federal Reserve S ystem. Irvine's AIM co - founder, Bernard Yoh, was a Vietnam - era underling of CIA asset, General Edward Lansdale. 750 It was Lansdale, as we saw in Chapter 11, who was in charge of the anti - Castro operations being conducted under the name Operation Mongoose i n league with the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate. It was during his service in Vietnam, as we noted in Chapter 12, that Lansdale worked closely with the Corsican Mafia — an integral part of the Lansky drug smuggling operations conducted in league with the CIA. That Lansdale's former Vietnam era associate would come out swinging against JFK conspiracy theories, then, is no big surprise. AIM'S ISRAELI CONNECTION The aforementioned Yoh is also affiliated with the International Security Council (ISC), a think tan k notable for its central devotion to the advancement of Israel's interests in U.S. foreign policy - making. The founder of the ISC was the ubiquitous Dr. Joseph Churba, an ordained rabbi whom we first encountered in Chapter 8 as a protégé of Jay Lovestone w ho coordinated CIA contacts with the Corsican and Sicilian Mafias on behalf of the CIA's James J. Angleton. Interestingly enough, Churba (now deceased) was also a key figure in the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs and in an entity known as Am ericans for a Safe Israel (ASI) established in the United States as an outgrowth of the Israeli underground terrorist group, the Irgun. Among those intimately collaborating with the forerunners of ASI was the Romanian Jewish émigré, Ernst Mantello, whose b rother Giorgio, along with Major Louis M. Bloomfield, was one of the founders of the shadowy Permindex entity examined in detail in Chapter 15. 751 ANOTHER CIA - LANSKY CONNECTION Another AIM figure is equally interesting in light of the organization's crit ique of JFK assassination conspiracy theories. AIM's president is Murray Baron, not only a former official with the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate - dominated International Brotherhood of Teamsters, but also a"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"340 They Dare Not Speak Out [279] member of the CIA - funded Citizens Committee for a Free Cuba and the co - founder of the Citizens Committee for Peace With Freedom in Vietnam. 752 It might be added, in passing, that AIM has consistently also been a strident defender of Israel and its interests. To even hint at any conspiracy which migh t involve Israel and its allies in the CIA would be an outrage, insofar as AIM would be concerned. So much, then, for accuracy in media from Accuracy in Media. OLIVER STONE What about Oliver Stone's JFK? Where does this controversial film fit in the lore of JFK assassination conspiracy theories? What of the media's hysterical response to the film (which actually brought it greater publicity)? Writing in the New York Times on December 20, 1991, Stone asked a rather simple question: \"When a leader of any co untry is assassinated, the media normally ask: 'What political forces were opposed to this leader and would benefit from his assassination?\" The irony, as we shall see, is that although Oliver Stone himself seemed to have asked that very question in a big, big way — through the aegis of his controversial film JFK — the fact is that Stone himself has, in a sense, proven in the end to have become a major factor in the continuing cover - up of the real truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. It is ironic i ndeed that although Stone's film JFK has focused widespread international attention on the JFK assassination conspiracy, there has been quiet speculation that the media's furor might be part of a high - level plan to further cover up the truth about the cons piracy. Many JFK assassination researchers, Mark Lane in particular, are deeply concerned that Stone's film presents a strange mixture of both fact and fiction. The facts about the assassination conspiracy are sensational enough without fictional details b eing added, he and others have pointed out. Lane summarized it best: \"It was good that Stone called the attention of teenagers and others to the unsolved murder. It was bad that he did so by falsifying the record.\" 753 POINTING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION Alt hough Stone's film referenced, in passing, the CIA connections of David Ferrie and Clay Shaw — and actually mentioned Permindex — the film's primary thrust was that the conspiracy originated in the so - called \"military - industrial\" complex. The primary conspirat ors were presented as high - level military men and their allies among the multi - billion - dollar defense contracting companies. The intelligence community's role was understated, to say the very least. This, in itself, lead some of Stone's critics to suggest that perhaps the ultimate purpose behind the film was not, in fact, to pinpoint those truly responsible for the JFK assassination, but to point the finger in another"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"[280] Final Judgment 341 d ir ectio n. T he evidence fo r this, a s we sha ll see, is com p elling indeed. STONE'S LANSKY - ISRAEL CONNECTION That distribution for Stone's film was handled by Warner Brothers is somewhat unsettling in light of the conclusions reached in Final Judgment . In fact, Warner Brothers, a subsidiary of the giant Time - Warner media empire, evolved from a film production company established by longtime Meyer Lansky associate, Louis Chesler, a Canadian of somewhat dubious reputation. It was in 1956 that Chesler, a Lansky front man, established Seven Arts Productions in Montreal, Canada. Although ostensibly a film production company, Seven Arts functioned as a money - laundering facility for Lansky and others among his associates. 754 By 1955, Seven Arts had gone into partnership with a New York - based banking consortium and was flush with money within a decade. In 1967 Seven Arts shook Wall Street and stunned Hollywood when it gained control of the famous Warner Brothers Studios — in short, a Lansky take - over. The move was a mystery to many at the time, but little did they know of the behind - the - scenes Lansky Synd icate dealings which made the wheeling and dealing possible. The new operation was dubbed Warner - Seven Arts Studios and, by 1968, was known as Warner Communications. 755 Not surprisingly, it just so happens, it was Bernie Cornfeld's Investors Overseas Servi ce (JOS) which \"owned major blocks of stock\" 756 in Warner - Seven Arts. Cornfeld of IOS, as we saw in Chapter 15, was a front man for Tibor Rosenbaum, former Mossad official and the prime mover behind the Lanksy - linked Permindex operation that was so central to the JFK assassination conspiracy. THE 'ISRAELI MAFIA' In 1981 a major scandal rocked Warner Communications. Several of its top figures — Solomon Weiss, Stephen Ross and Jay Emmett — were caught up in tax fraud, bribery, and assorted other racketeering ch arges brought by the Justice Department. Warner's links to organized crime were being investigated. 757 However, what is particularly significant about the case is that much of the evidence against the aforementioned Weiss, who was senior assistant treasure r of Warner Communications, emerged from records gleaned from the files of the United Jewish Appeal and other pro - Israel philanthropies that were seized by the Justice Department. 758 What's more, the Warner Communications investigation repeatedly stumbled upon links to the so - called \"Israeli mafia,\" — the domestic elements of organized criminal activity operating in Israel."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"342 They Dare Not Speak Out [281] And, to draw the circle even tighter, the Warner investigation of the aforementioned Stephen Ross by Justice uncovered close links betw een the media giant and the American Bank and Trust (ABT) scandal. 759 TIBOR ROSENBAUM, AGAIN In Chapter 7 we first learned that the New York - based ABT was an American subsidiary of the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank, upon whose board served none other than the Israeli Mossad's Tibor Rosenbaum, sponsor of the aforementioned Bernie Cornfeld of IOS. It was, as we have seen, ironically enough, on November 22, 1963, that Swiss Israel assumed management of American Bank and Trust. The latter firm, however, ultimately went belly up, having been looted by financier David Graiver, himself a longtime Mossad operative. One of those tarnished by the ABT scandal — and ultimately linked to the Warner Communications affair — was New York financier Abraham Feinberg who not only serv ed as a director of ABT, but who had also been the individual who arranged John F. Kennedy's first unpleasant meeting with the key money men in the pro - Israel lobby in America (described in Chapter 4). 760 Warner Communications survived the series of scand als and then, ultimately, merged with Time - Life, Inc., the other great media giant which, itself, has been scored by JFK assassination researchers for lending itself to the JFK assassination cover - up. THE GANG AT TIME - LIFE It was in Chapter 10, for examp le, that we learned how Life correspondent Richard Billings went to New Orleans and sabotaged Jim Garrison's investigation into the JFK assassination. Billings and his team used Life magazine as a forum to portray Garrison as a tool of \"the Mafia.\" Billing s and company presented Garrison as a shill for New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello, but, of course, ignored Marcello's secondary positioning to Marcello's sponsor, Meyer Lansky. Billings himself later served on the staff of the House Assassinations Com mittee which blamed the JFK murder on \"the Mafia,\" working alongside the committee's director, G. Robert Blakey, who several years previously had been employed as a character witness on behalf of longtime Lansky confidant Morris Dalitz, ostensibly \"proving \" that Dalitz was not linked with the underworld. So it was that Time - Life and Warner Communications merged, becoming Time - Warner. And, of course, it was one of Time - Warner's subsidiaries, Warner Brothers, which ultimately became the distribution company f or Oliver Stone's JFK — which blamed \"the military - industrial complex\" — not Israel's Mossad, not the Mafia, not even the CIA itself — for the JFK assassination."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"[282] Final Judgment 343 (The same company, through its subsidiary, Time - Warner Books, also handled distribution for the bi ography of Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana that suggested that it was strictly a CIA - Mafia plot against JFK, orchestrated almost solely by Giancana himself.) THE BRONFMANS, AGAIN Interestingly enough, in early 1993 the Lansky syndicate - linked Bronfman f amily, through their Seagram Company, purchased a substantial controlling interest in Time Warner, further cementing the media giant into the tightly - knit circles of the CIA - Lansky Syndicate - Israeli Mossad connection that have swirled around the company si nce its inception. It was, as we saw in Chapter 15, Major Louis M. Bloomfield, chief executive operative of the Permindex entity, who had been longtime personal attorney for the Bronfman interests and a major figure in the Israeli lobby in Canada. That a c ompany which has been intimately tied from its earliest years not only with the inner circles of Meyer Lansky and his international crime syndicate, but also with Israel and its Mossad, should be the sponsor of Oliver Stone's grand conspiracy theory is eno ugh to make one wonder, to say the least. But there's more. It is somewhat interesting to note that when Stone hired on a public relations agency to handle the publicity and controversy which emerged when the film was released, it was the powerful Washingt on, D.C. firm of Hill & Knowlton. After all, it was Hill & Knowlton that orchestrated major propaganda in favor of American involvement in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq — and in favor of Israel. STONE'S ADL CONNECTION What's more, the Hill & Knowlton e xecutive who handled his firm's efforts on behalf of Stone, Frank Mankiewicz, got his start in the public relations business working on behalf of the pro - Israel Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith in Los Angeles. (In Chapter 18, we shall see, Mank iewicz himself had a curious role in the circumstances surrounding yet another Kennedy assassination.) STONE REACTS TO FINAL JUDGMENT . . . In Washington, D.C., on February 16, 1994, an associate of this author attempted to present Oliver Stone with a co py of the first edition of this book, Final Judgment. This came several months after the book was first advertised in the program of the annual symposium on the JFK assassination sponsored by the JFK Assassination Information Center in Dallas, Texas. Altho ugh Stone hadn't been in attendance at the symposium, he was represented there by one of his associates and it is certain that Stone was"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"344 They Dare Not Speak Out [283] aware of the release of Final Judgment. After all, a full - page advertisement promoting a book featuring an introducti on by Stone appeared opposite a full - page advertisement for Final Judgment. When Stone was presented his copy of the book, however, his face froze when he saw the book's cover and he refused to accept the book, saying, \"Please send it to me in the mail.\" T he \"maverick\" self - styled free - thinker, Stone, turned his back and walked away, moments later accepting another package of material presented to him by another individual. Why was Stone so hesitant to accept this book? Perhaps we have information that prov ides the answer. Stone did, in fact, know of the so - called \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination documented in Final Judgment and referenced in the advertisement in the program of the JFK forum in Dallas. STONE AND 'THE FRENCH CONNECTION' You see, shortly after Final Judgment went to press, Ron Lewis, who was a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans and who also worked in Guy Banister's \"French\" - connected operation, revealed something very interesting about Stone and the \"French\" connection. Wh en Lewis, who served as a consultant to Stone during the filming of JFK, assisted Stone in setting up the movie sets recreating Banister's New Orleans office, Stone included a number of boxes, ostensibly containing arms, that were stenciled in Spanish. Lew is objected to the Spanish, saying, \"The writing on the boxes was in French,\" — the arms having been linked to the OAS rebellion, backed by the Israeli - sponsored Permindex operation, against French President Charles DeGaulle. But Stone responded to Lewis by saying, \"Spanish serves the theme of the movie better.\" So, as Lewis commented, \"Spanish it was.\" 761 So it also was that Oliver Stone ignored the \"French\" connection — a connection which, in turn, brings forth the Israeli connection to the assassination of J ohn F. Kennedy. A wise move indeed for a film - maker whose sponsors had intimate ties to the guilty parties involved in the crime that Stone brought to grisly life on film. STONE'S MOSSAD CONNECTION However, there is one last rather intriguing fact about Oliver Stone and his widely - promoted film that deserves mention. Although Stone was, beyond question, the undeniably talented creative genius responsible for JFK, one must always remember that in the motion picture arena, it is ultimately money — pure and si mple — that determines whether or not a film will be made. The all - important task of arranging financing falls into the lap of the film's producer. If one checks the credits for Stone's JFK, one will find the name \"Arnon Milchan\" listed as \"executive produce r.\""},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"[284] Final Judgment 345 Who is Arnon Milchan? Why is his name relevant in our examination of the facts about Israel's role in the JFK assassination conspiracy and the manner in which Oliver Stone has suppressed that critical factor? According to liberal journalist Alexander Cockburn, writing in The Nation on May 18, 1992, Milchan, the executive producer of JFK, \"was identified in one 1989 Israeli report as 'probably [Israel's] largest arms dealer.' A company he owned was once caught smuggling nuclear weapons fuses to Iraq. A s part of a joint Israeli - South African government operation — `Muldergate' — he acted as launderer to money scheduled to quell liberal publications opposing apartheid.\" 762 Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi, who has studied Israel's global arms trading, does describe Milchan as a \"Mossad man.\" 763 However, in light of JFK's behind - the - scenes battle with Israel over the issue of Israel's nuclear development, what is perhaps even more intriguing is that, according to James Riordan, Oliver Stone's biographer : \"Milchan has been in the international headlines for making deals to benefit Israel's nuclear arms program, but he claims defense of his homeland, not profit, has been his motive.\" 764 But that's not all. It also turns out, according to Riordan, that Milc han made available what Riordan described as \"French money\" 765 for the production of Stone's film. Thus, we have a Mossad figure in the center of Israel's nuclear development program providing the financing — along with his French partners — of a film that not only 1) suppresses the so - called \"French connection\" (described even by one of the film's consultants, the aforementioned Ron Lewis) but which 2) never once hints at JFK's bitter conflict with Israel, in particular the struggle over Israel's drive to asse mble a nuclear arsenal. A 'LIMITED HANGOUT' HOLLYWOOD STYLE? With all of this in mind, is it really a stretch of the imagination to suggest then that Oliver Stone's \"interpretation\" of the JFK assassination conspiracy was, in fact, a highly sophisticated form of black propaganda financed by Mossad money? Was the massive media hype given to Stone's film some form of \"limited hangout\" on behalf of Israel and its allies in the CIA? Was the widespread promotion of Stone's film a way of finally attempting to p ut an end to the controversy and give the public what it wanted: some form of explanation as to \"what really happened\" in Dallas? This, of course, we will never know. It is probably worth noting, additionally, that since Final Judgment was first published I have been told — but have never been able to confirm — that Oliver Stone has been a generous contributor to the America - Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lobby for Israel. If true, then this is simply another interesting detail which helps further explain why Stone might choose to ignore all of the evidence which does demonstrate a definitive Israeli connection to the assassination of John F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"346 They Dare N ot Speak Out [285] A N I N V I T A T I O N T O D E B A T E . . . I would relish the opportunity to debate Oliver Stone in a public forum. After all, we do (apparently) agree that Jim Garrison was on to something when he launched his investigation of Clay Shaw. That's a good starting point. Where we part company, it seems, is just how far the conspiracy really went. Stone draws the line at Sh aw's connection to Israel. I don't. What an interesting debate that would be. If there are any readers of Final Judgment who could arrange such a debate, by all means let me know. WHERE STONE FAILED . . . As we noted earlier, Stone himself asked this que stion in the New York Times: \"When a leader of any country is assassinated, the media normally ask: 'What political forces were opposed to this leader and would benefit from his assassination?'\" As we have seen, one political force that was opposed to John F. Kennedy and would benefit from his assassination was Israel, yet Stone himself evidently prefers not to name that particular force. Despite all the criticisms we have aimed at Stone — and they are very much deserved — Stone's film has still led the way for new popular perceptions about the obvious fact that it was a conspiracy that ended the life of John F. Kennedy. Stone failed to nail down the source of that conspiracy but in the pages of Final Judgment we have done just that. What a shame indeed that Oli ver Stone could not have told the entire story of the conspiracy. THE MEDIA REJECTS A FINAL JUDGMENT Clearly, the media's coverage — or be it non - coverage --- of the JFK assassination was critical to the cover - up of the real origins of the conspiracy that re sulted in the president's assassination. That the media played a major part in perpetuating the cover - up is unquestioned and that Israel and its lobby has a major influence in shaping the American media can likewise not be questioned. Although the media in itially supported the Warren Commission's conclusions, public skepticism forced the media to bring forth a wide variety of cover stories and limited portions of the truth. But the Israeli connection has never been considered — until now."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Chapter Eighteen T he Heir to the Throne The Assa ssina t io n of Robert F.

On its face, the \"official\" explanation of the circumstances surrounding the death of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy is as simple as the Warren Commission Report on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In both instances, so the story goes, \"one lone nut\" was responsible for the crime. There was no conspiracy. Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles in 1968 came just after RFK (elected to the Senate from New York in 1964) had won the critical Calif ornia Democratic presidential primary. This put the younger Kennedy in the lead for his party's presidential nomination and thus potentially in line to move into the White House following the general election. It was in the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel where RFK delivered his California victory speech to an assembled crowd of supporters. After concluding his speech, the triumphant Kennedy wanted to work his way through the crowd in the ballroom to make his exit from the hotel. However, according to one campaign volunteer who was on the scene, one of Kennedy's handlers repeatedly insisted that Kennedy exit through the hotel kitchen behind the ballroom. The handler who was so insistent that RFK exit through the kitchen was Frank Mankiewicz, who had started his career in the public relations business at the Los Angeles office of the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, and who, as we saw in Chapter 17, handled publicity for Oliver Stone's JFK extravaganza. 766 It was there in that kitchen where Mank iewicz steered Senator Kennedy that a young Arab - American named Sirhan Sirhan was waiting. According to the late William Sullivan, longtime assistant FBI director, \"We could never account for Sirhan's presence in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel.\" 767 Ho wever, we now know why Bobby Kennedy left through the hotel kitchen, rather than the way he himself wanted to leave, although Mankiewicz has said that it was RFK's decision to go through the kitchen — against the former ADL man's wishes."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"348 The Heir to the Throne [287] `AN ARAB DID IT' What really happened in those few short seconds is still the subject of controversy, although the bottom line was this: shots were fired at Robert F. Kennedy. The presidential hopeful was critically wounded. He died shortly thereafter. The Arab - American as sailant was pummeled to the floor, arrested, convicted and sentenced to prison. The public was somberly told that Sirhan was dissatisfied with Kennedy's strong pro - Israel stand and that this was one of the driving motivations that led him to commit the cri me. So it was that an Arab - American was held up to the world as the killer of a martyred American president's younger brother, himself a popular public figure. What an irony that it was an Arab - American who would happen to be the assassin of the Kennedy br other who was perceived by \"insiders\" to be, at least in private, an anti - Semite in the mold of his father. That Kennedy did indeed take a strident pro - Israel stand during his years in the U.S. Senate is not in doubt. As a senator from New York State (whic h, of course, has a heavily Jewish voting population), that was a political necessity for Robert Kennedy, who was, if nothing else, a pragmatist, at least. (However, as we saw in Chapter 5, it was RFK himself who believed that the loyalties of his own brot her's top advisor on Jewish affairs, Myer Feldman, were suspect. \"[Feldman's] major interest,\" said RFK, \"was Israel rather than the United States.)\" 768 If anybody knew of President John F. Kennedy's secret war with Israel (which we examined in detail in C hapter 5) it was his brother and confidant, Robert F. Kennedy. Thus it was that an Arab patsy took the fall for RFK's murder — a crime that had evolved from a conspiracy that was decidedly not Arabic in its origins. THE RFK CONSPIRACY In this chapter we sh all explore the source of the conspiracy that removed Robert Kennedy from the political arena and thereby precluded him from ever having the power to investigate the conspiracy that ended his brother's presidency. And as we shall see, the RFK assassination conspiracy comes full circle with the conspiracy that killed JFK: the same powerful, close - knit sources were connected, but in a uniquely different way. Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald who proclaimed himself a \"patsy,\" Sirhan Sirhan responded almost without prot est, with a certain passivity. This, among other things, led some to suspect that Sirhan, in fact, was a patsy, too, that he had been programmed — perhaps through drugs, or by hypnosis, for example — to kill RFK. Yet, in the weeks and months of investigation — o fficial and unofficial — that followed, it soon became apparent that there was evidence"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"[288] Final Judgment 349 that more than one gun had been fired in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel. Yet, perhaps precisely because of the continuing doubts over the first Kennedy assassinati on, public awareness of the serious questions arising from the second Kennedy assassination did not reach the same level. What's more, the turmoil of the year 1968 was such that there were many other things capturing the public's attention: the Vietnam War , racial violence and rioting, and the heated three - way presidential campaign between Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey and George C. Wallace. Although many believed that the murder of Bobby Kennedy was directly linked to the murder of his brother five years earlier, no one seemed able to fit the pieces of the puzzle together. ENTER SAVAK In fact, as former CIA contract agent, Robert Morrow, has demonstrated in his little - noticed (but very important) book, The Senator Must Die, there are connections between the two events — deeper than one might have imagined. Simply put, Morrow's thesis is this: that the murder of Robert F. Kennedy was a CIA contract hit, carried out through the CIA's long - standing ally in international intrigue, the SAVAK, the secret police o f the Shah of Iran — an intelligence agency created, in part, by Israel's Mossad itself and tied closely to the Mossad. (And as we noted in Chapter 15, information uncovered by Morrow ties the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate and its Swiss - based Israel i connection to the conspiracy that snuffed out the life of John F. Kennedy.) According to Morrow's own extensive investigation, during the final weeks of Robert F. Kennedy's ill - fated presidential campaign in 1968, one Khyber Khan, a high - ranking member o f the Shah's SAVAK, had infiltrated RFK's California campaign headquarters. Khan additionally brought in other SAVAK agents to work on the campaign. This infiltration was part of the assassination conspiracy. Khan was in charge of coordinating the hit on R FK. RFK allowed Khan into his inner circle because he believed Khan to be an opponent of the Shah of Iran. This conclusion was based upon his previous dealings with Khan. In the early 1960's Khan had become embroiled in a feud with the Shah over a business deal gone sour and in revenge had come to Washington where he provided then - Attorney General Robert Kennedy with evidence of the Shah's misappropriation of U.S. foreign aid to Iran. The resulting bad blood further strained relations between the Kennedy ad ministration and the Shah which had never been stable. However, Khan and the Shah had made amends shortly thereafter and an alliance had been cemented. Khan, in fact, set up SAVAK operations on the West Coast in 1963 — all of this, of course, unbeknownst to Robert F. Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"350 The Heir to the Throne [ 289] T H E S E C O N D ' G U N ' As part of Khan's scheme, the decision was made to have the actual assassination carried out by Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian - American, and another participant. According to Morrow's account, both Sirhan and the other gu nmen were on the scene when RFK was assassinated. Both men fired weapons. Sirhan was using the .22 caliber pistol that was taken from him after the assassination. The other gunman, however, was carrying a CIA - manufactured .22 caliber gun disguised as a cam era. After Kennedy gave his final address and made his way into the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel, Sirhan, of course, thrust his own weapon out and began firing toward the senator. This resulted in Sirhan being the focus of attention, although one witnes s said that he had told the authorities that Sirhan never got close enough for a point - blank shot. The other gunman, meanwhile, was also firing his weapon and probably delivered the fatal shot. In the midst of the melee, according to Morrow, the second gun man escaped with his \"camera.\" Obviously, it would not have done the assassination conspiracy good to have the other gunman captured with a CIA - manufactured weapon. OTHER POSSIBLE GUNMEN Many RFK assassination conspiracy theorists have pointed in the dir ection of a character named Thane Caesar who was on the scene at the time of the senator's murder, employed at the last minute by the Ambassador Hotel as a replacement for another security guard. There are those who suggest, without much real evidence, tha t Caesar was the \"second gun.\" Although Caesar has been popularly described as a \"bodyguard for Howard Hughes\" (the reclusive billionaire), his real connections are far more interesting. Caesar, evidently, had more firm ties to the Meyer Lansky Organized C rime Syndicate through his Las Vegas connections. But this doesn't implicate Caesar one way or the other. In the end, the Thane Caesar story is just another one of those distractions that really don't point anywhere. Meanwhile, in her new book, The Assassi nations (Los Angeles, Feral House, 2003), Lisa Pease has come forth with evidence that a British national of Jewish origin, Michael Wien, who went by the name of \"Michael Wayne,\" was in the Ambassador Hotel ballroom before the shooting of RFK and seemed to have had advance knowledge of the impending events. After the shooting there were allegations that Wien (or \"Wayne\") was carrying what appeared to some to be a cardboard tube or some similar item and some people thought he had a gun concealed inside. Alth ough the police apparently took Wien into custody for a brief period, Pease suggests that there are many more questions about Wien — and other suspicious individuals who were there that day - that remain unanswered. But Ms. Pease is one in the \"research\" commu nity who dares not say \"Mossad.\""},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"[290] Final Judgment 351 THE INVESTIGATION IS SCUTTLED In any event, as Robert Morrow notes, later attempts to investigate the conspiracy further were frustrated by two CIA operatives on the Los Angeles Police Department's \"Special Unit Senator\" set up to \"inquire\" into the assassination. Morrow says that the operatives were officers Manny Pena and Enrique Hernandez, both of whom were known to have worked for the CIA, along with their work for the police department. This, in essence, is the recon struction of the RFK assassination conspiracy which Morrow documents so convincingly in his book The Senator Must Die. Much of Morrow's research was supported by information he gleaned in an interview with one Alexis Goodaryi of Washington, D.C. Although i n his public persona he was the popular maitre de of the exclusive Rotunda Restaurant on Capitol Hill, Goodaryi was also the immediate SAVAK superior of Khyber Khan, the West Coast SAVAK operative who coordinated the RFK murder. Goodaryi himself was murder ed in early 1977 — just one month after he spoke with Morrow. However, although the media described Goodaryi's murder as a \"mob hit,\" Morrow's sources told him otherwise: it was a SAVAK operation. 769 THE LANSKY CONNECTION All of this is quite interesting, particularly in that Morrow notes that Goodyari told him that during their association, he (Goodyari) introduced Khyber Khan to a number of his Washington associates in organized crime: in particular, one C. H. \"Jim\" Poller. Mr. Poller, according to Morro w, was the \"Washington mob liaison man for [Meyer] Lansky and Santo Trafficante.\" 77 0 Thus, we once again see the specter of Meyer Lansky in the murky background in the assassination of a Kennedy. We might even take one further step. During the time that S irhan Sirhan was being groomed for his role in the slaying of Robert F. Kennedy, the young Arab - American worked in the stables of the Santa Anita racetrack. Santa Anita, in fact, was one of the primary profit - centers for Lansky's West Coast henchman, Micke y Cohen, rackets boss of Southern California. We can only speculate that Cohen and his underlings may have had a hand in some aspect of the RFK assassination. However, it is not speculation that Iran's SAVAK (which handled the killing of Robert F. Kennedy) was closely allied with the American CIA. The record on this is all too clear. The CIA's role in toppling a nationalist Iranian ruler, Mohammed Mossadegh, and restoring the Shah of Iran to his throne in 1953 is well - known and widely documented. What is le ss - known, however, is the close working relationship between Iran's SAVAK and the Israeli Mossad. Although Iran, a Persian"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"352 The Heir To the Thone [2 91] nation, and Israel might be perceived to be hostile to one another, this was not the case at all. ISRAEL AND IRAN In 1958 Israeli Prime Minister Ben - Gurion proposed to American President Dwight D. Eisenhower a united front against Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. According to Ben - Gurion, \"With the purpose of erecting a high dam against the Nasserist - Soviet tidal wave, we have beg un tightening our links with several states on the outside perimeter of the Middle East. Our goal is to organize a group of countries, not necessarily an official alliance, that will be able to stand strong against Soviet expansion by proxy through Nasser. \" 771 Iran was one of those countries that Ben - Gurion proposed be part of this new alliance. Ben - Gurion had it in mind that Iran could be utilized to keep the Arab countries of Iraq and Syria under control. 772 In fact, Israel had been actively engaged in attempting to interfere in Iran's domestic affairs for some time. According to Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, writing in Dangerous Liaison: The Inside Story of the U.S. - Israeli Covert Relationship, \"Israeli agents had been at work encouraging friendly forces in Iran since the early days of the state.\" 773 The results paid off: in June 1950, for example, Iran had given Israel 'de facto' diplomatic recognition — (a designation just short of full diplomatic recognition). Although, according to the Cockburns, the r elationship between Iran and Israel was uneasy and involved much international intrigue \"the connection between the Shah's Iran and Israel rested on firm foundations. The two countries shared a strong suspicion and dislike of the Arab nations on their bord ers. Both had strong connections to the United States, in particular the CIA.\" 774 IRAN AND THE ISRAELI LOBBY Additionally, note the Cockburns, \"Each [country] had something to offer that the other needed. In Iran's case it was oil, which it began to shi p to Israel in 1954. Israel, for its part, could offer valuable expertise in the fields of intelligence, and domestic security. In the eyes of the Shah, Israel had something even more valuable to bestow on its friends: the pervasive influence of the Jews i n the United States and indeed the world over. \"[Israeli official] David Kimche recalls with amusement how 'if there'd be any anti - Iranian article in any newspaper in the United States or even in Europe, the Shah would call us and say, 'Why did you allow t his to happen?' We would in vain plead innocent [reported Kimche] 'saying that we don't control the whole of world media [and] we don't control the banks as some people think we do.'"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"[292] Final Judgment 353 \"Chaim Herzog [president of Israel] who had many dealings with the Iran ian monarch while head of [Israel's] Military Intelligence, later said that [the Shah of Iran] saw every Israeli as a link to Washington.\" 775 SAVAK'S ISRAELI ORIGINS Mansur Rafizadeh, the former SAVAK chief, who later broke with the Shah, has also provi ded us additional light on the close relationship between SAVAK, the CIA and the Mossad. Writing in his memoirs, Rafizadeh reveals that SAVAK was set up at the joint urging of Israel, the United States and Britain. 776 The initial contacts between SAVAK an d Mossad appear to have been established in the fall of 1957 at a meeting between General Taimour Bakhtiar and Mossad chief Isser Harel in Rome. They agreed upon mutual interests. 777 ISRAEL TRAINS SAVAK Not only did Israel provide training for the new S AVAK recruits, but so did the CIA. In charge of the CIA's training of SAVAK operatives was an operation known as the International Police Academy in Washington. This academy also played a major part in training operatives of Israel's Mossad. The academy wa s run by one Joseph Shimon, a man with additional interesting connections. 778 Shimon counted among his close friends Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana and the Mafia's roving ambassador, Johnny Rosselli, whose own roles in the JFK assassination conspiracy we reviewed in detail in Chapter 11. Shimon, in fact, also testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1975 that he participated in meetings between Giancana, Rosselli and CIA operatives in Miami in preparation for CIA - Organized Crime assassination plots against Fidel Castro. 779 A DELIGHTED SHAH That the Shah of Iran was pleased by the murder of John F. Kennedy (and certainly that of Robert Kennedy to be sure) is undoubted. According to former SAVAK chief Rafizadeh: \"The assassination of Presiden t Kennedy on November 22, 1963 made the Shah jubilant. Kennedy had put pressure on him for social reforms. I learned later . . . that the Shah had had a kind of celebration. When he received the news of Kennedy's death, he asked for a drink to celebrate. 7 80 \"The Shah had despised Kennedy, who constantly advised him to restore human rights to his subjects and insisted that such a course of action was necessary and unavoidable. The Shah viewed that course as a derided threat to his power and so had refused."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"354 An Heir To the Throne [293] \"Now the threat posed by Kennedy was gone; the Shah's relationship with President Johnson was comfortable and he felt no fear of the United States despite the huge demonstrations mounted against him in New York, Washington, and indeed throughout the coun try [when he came to America on state visits]. \" 781 (It should be noted, significantly, that Robert Morrow flatly states in his account of the RFK murder that Rafizadeh was, in fact, the SAVAK official in Iran who directed the aforementioned Khyber Khan to orchestrate the RFK assassination plot. Morrow contends that Rafizadeh was promoted to his post as SAVAK chief as a reward for the successful assault on RFK. 782 Thus it is interesting, to say the least, that we find Rafizadeh commenting on the Shah's rea ction to JFK's assassination. In his own book, of course, Rafizadeh does not discuss the circumstances surrounding RFK's murder at the hands of the CIA - Mossad - backed SAVAK.) PERPETUATING THE COVER - UP The murder of Robert F. Kennedy by the Shah's SAVAK w as a re - affirmation of a long - standing hostility between the Kennedy brothers and the Shah. RFK's murder helped perpetuate the cover - up of the role that SAVAK's allies in the CIA and the Mossad had played in the previous Kennedy assassination. It was again — as in the JFK assassination — a case of mutual interests coming into play. RICHARD HELMS AND THE SHAH There is yet another interesting personal connection between the Shah of Iran and the CIA worth noting. In fact, in the early 1930's Richard Helms (who l ater became director of the CIA in 1966) and the Shah had been best friends and schoolmates together as children at boarding school in Switzerland. 783 It was Helms who was later the CIA coordinator of the very coup that installed the Shah on the throne in 1953. 784 It was a lifelong relationship which culminated with Helms later becoming U.S. Ambassador to Iran. Thus it was that through his relationship with Iran and SAVAK, as Robert Morrow notes, that Helms \"suddenly would have at his beck and call a worl dwide, covert strike - force of dedicated, trained, professional agents and assassins. \"785 It was during his tenure at the CIA, as we have seen in Chapter 8, that Helms was the \"chief patron\" of the CIA's Mossad liaison, and devoted supporter of Israel, Jame s Jesus Angleton. And it was after Helms became director that he and Angleton became entangled in a little - noticed controversy involving a CIA memorandum that ostensibly fingered CIA operative E. Howard Hunt as having been in Dallas the day that John F. Ke nnedy was assassinated. (In Chapter 16, we analyzed that memorandum in detail.)"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"[294] Final Judgment 355 SOM E CONCLUDING REM ARKS That there was a role by Israel's allies in the CIA and SAVAK in the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy seems clear, based on the information brought forth by Robert Morrow, coupled with our knowledge of the close relationship between SAVAK and its sponsors in the CIA and the Mossad. With Robert Kennedy eliminated from the presidential race in 1968 those who were responsible for the assassination of hi s brother would have no fear of retribution in the event that RFK assumed the presidency. If Morrow is correct — that SAVAK coordinated the assassination on behalf of the CIA — then JFK assassination researchers should begin looking at SAVAK's origins. But to do so, of course, would point in the direction of the Mossad — an area where JFK assassination researchers fear to tread. It should be noted that The Globe supermarket tabloid was hit with a major libel judgment after a Pakistani - American filed suit against the tabloid for publishing Robert Morrow's allegations that this person was the \"second gun\" in the assassination of Robert Kennedy. Morrow himself died (apparently of natural causes) shortly after the judgment was reached, and which judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on May 17, 1999. 786 In The Senator Must Die, Morrow reproduced a photograph of this man, then a student, with a camera on a strap around his neck, standing beside Senator Kennedy shortly before the fatal shots were fired. Morrow alleged that he was the second gunman, although it is now clear he was not. That this individual was innocent does not mean, however, that there was not a \"second gun\" or that Morrow's basic theory is off base. Yet, for the record, as I have noted elsewhere in th e pages of Final Judgment, I have long had reservations about many of Morrow's allegations regarding other matters. However, if my thesis about Israel's role in the JFK assassination is correct (and I believe it is), it is logical that RFK's assassination was indeed orchestrated by forces within Israel's sphere of influence. In short, I tend to believe that, on the whole, Morrow's overall thesis regarding RFK's assassination is correct. SUMMING UP . . . In the \"conclusion\" which follows we tie together th e basic parameters of the JFK assassination conspiracy that have been outlined in the pages of Final Judgment. It has been a complex web, in a certain sense, but when one considers the fact that the Israeli connection is ever present, the assassination con spiracy that has been outlined is rather simple indeed. However, in the appendices which follow, we will see that there are many other facets of the conspiracy and cover - up that have been otherwise ignored, suppressed, un - recognized or forgotten. In those appendices we will see, again and again, the Israeli connection to the JFK assassination that was never before documented until the publication of Final Judgment."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION: Operation Haman?

They were protecting their own interests. By 1963, John F. Kennedy had made many enemies. His brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy's prosecutions of Mafia and Meyer Lansky - bossed Organized Crime figures had many in the c rime syndicate very angry, to say the least. The early stages for the prosecution of Meyer Lansky himself were already underway. A case had already been made against Lansky's New Orleans front man Carlos Marcello. Lansky's West Coast henchman Mickey Cohen had been targeted as well. THE ISRAELI - CONNECTED LANSKY SYNDICATE Lansky was the ultimate target: the enmity between the Kennedy family and Meyer Lansky went back decades. Not only was the President's father, Joseph P. Kennedy considered an enemy of the Jewish people, but he was also believed by Lansky to hold a grudge against him (Lansky) because of a Lansky - orchestrated hijacking of one of Kennedy Sr.'s illicit whiskey - running deals. Considering John F. Kennedy's secret alliance with the mob during the 1960 campaign, his war against Lansky's underworld syndicate was a double - cross that could not be tolerated. LYNDON JOHNSON The president was also planning to drop his Vice President, Lyndon Johnson, from the 1964 ticket. It was possible that Johnson — lon g financed politically by Lansky and his New Orleans Mafia henchman, Carlos Marcello — could end up spending the remainder of his years in prison. The Kennedy brothers were interested in Johnson's deals conducted"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"[296] Final Judgment 357 through his front man, Bobby Baker, who lat er did end up in prison. Baker, of course, conducted several of his major deals with Lansky associates, including Ed Levinson, a director of the Mossad - linked Banque de Credit International, founded by former Mossad official Tibor Rosenbaum. THE ANTI - CAST RO CUBANS What's more, Kennedy was preparing for a rapprochement with Castro's Cuba and therefore the Lansky syndicate would not be able to re - invigorate its massive gambling interests there as a consequence. The change in Cuban policy was also distressin g to the anti - Castro Cuban community in Miami, New Orleans and elsewhere. The anti - Castro Cubans had, of course, been cooperating closely with the Lansky syndicate in anti - Castro activities. Likewise, the new Cuban policy enraged the CIA which was the prim ary sponsor of the anti - Castro forces. As we have also seen, the Mossad played a major (although little - known) part in the intrigue involving the anti - Castro Cubans through its base in Miami. THE CIA JFK had other problems with the CIA. He was making mov es to dismantle the CIA and was engaged in a secret war with that agency stemming from his clear intent to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam. This would have been a major blow to the so - called \"military - industrial complex\" (of which the Israeli lobby was a major component) that stood to make immense profits from a continuing U.S. presence in Southeast Asia. HOOVER Ultimately, Kennedy planned to merge all of the American intelligence agencies — the FBI included — into a single entity under his brother Robert's direction. This plan, of course, was not greeted enthusiastically by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover whom Kennedy also planned to dethrone following the 1964 election. Hoover, as we have seen, had his own secret arrangements with Lansky, individually, and wi th organized crime in general. Hoover also had a foundation established in his name with funding from Lansky - linked liquor industries and the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, which functions as a de facto U.S. propaganda and intelligence arm o f Israel's Mossad. If Hoover himself did not actively conspire against the life of John F. Kennedy, he certainly looked the other way if he knew a conspiracy to assassinate JFK had been hatched. VIETNAM & DRUGS Kennedy's intended change in Vietnam policy — his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the imbroglio — infuriated not only the CIA but elements in the Pentagon and their allies in the military - industrial complex. By this"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"358 Operation Haman? [297] time, of course, the Lansky syndicate had already set up international heroin - runn ing from Southeast Asia through the CIA - linked Corsican Mafia in the Mediterranean. The joint Lansky - CIA operations in the international drug racket were a lucrative venture that thrived as a consequence of deep U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia as cover for the drug smuggling activities. We know today that the Mossad has emerged as a major player as a \"middleman\" in much of this drug - smuggling activity. ISRAEL, THE CIA & THE LANSKY SYNDICATE John F. Kennedy's bitter behind - the - scenes conflict with Israe l brought him into combat with an ally of not only the CIA but also the Lansky syndicate, both of which entities also maintained intimate connections to the anti - Castro Cubans. Vice President Lyndon Johnson's Lansky - Mafia and defense industry ties, coupled with his close relationship to the Israeli lobby, and his long - standing friendly dealings with both the CIA and Hoover's FBI made Johnson an acceptable alternative (among these diverse special interests) to a Kennedy dynasty. Kennedy himself had long been suspect in the eyes of Israel and its allies as we saw in Chapter 4. We also now know that even the famed \"Chicago Mafia\" under Sam Giancana was heavily immersed in wide - ranging international dealings with Israel's Mossad — largely through the good offices of the real boss of the Chicago syndicate, Meyer Lansky's partner - in - crime, Hyman Lamer. So the theory that even \"the Chicago Mafia killed JFK\" — we find — has a very distinct \"Mossad connection\" beyond any doubt. MICKEY COHEN As early as 1960 (as we documen ted in Chapter 13), Meyer Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, was using Kennedy's filmland bed - partner, actress Marilyn Monroe, as a conduit for attempting to learn Kennedy's intentions toward Israel. Kennedy's introduction to Miss Monroe by one of Cohen's associates, we have learned, was for this very purpose, and also, perhaps, for ultimately blackmailing JFK. Although \"official\" history acknowledges the president's stormy affair with Miss Monroe, its real origins — and the intent for which it was o rchestrated — have been covered up and forgotten. (\"Official\" history would have us remember — instead — Kennedy's other widely - publicized illicit relationship with Judith Campbell, mistress of Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana.) Cohen, a long - standing disciple of Israel and one of its earliest adherents, had more than a passing interest in the Middle East state. According to one account, we have discovered, Cohen was less than happy with Kennedy's stance toward Israel. BEN - GURION AND THE ISRAELI NUCLEAR BOM B"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"[298] Final Judgm ent 359 By April 1963, Kennedy's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion and the state of Israel was at a dangerous impasse, particularly over Israel's determination to develop a nuclear bomb. At Kennedy's last official press conference, he bemoane d the Israeli lobby's deliberate sabotage of his own efforts to build bridges to the Arab world. Little did JFK know that the seeds of his own destruction had been sown as a consequence of his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East Israeli leader David Ben - Gurion had developed an intense personal distrust — even hatred and contempt — for Kennedy. He believed that Kennedy's presidency was a danger to the very survival of the state of Israel — the nation that Ben - Gurion had helped create. Ben - Gurion, by this tim e, was consumed with paranoia. He believed that Israel might be destroyed. It was because of his contempt for Kennedy and the American president's stance toward Israel that Ben - Gurion left his post as prime minister. It is likely that his last act as prime minister was to order Mossad orchestration of a hit on John F. Kennedy. We have learned that it was then - Mossad assassination team chief Yitzhak Shamir who took care of the arrangements necessary to set the conspiracy in motion. Shamir knew, of course, th at a diverse array of interests — domestic and international — would like to see Kennedy removed from the White House. There were a variety of components that could be put together to ensure a successful assassination conspiracy: specifically the Mossad - linked Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate as well as the CIA, and the elements in their spheres of influence. Was there a code name for the conspiracy against President Kennedy? More than likely. But we, of course, will surely never know its name. Did the Mo ssad, perhaps, call it \"Operation Haman\" — naming the conspiracy to kill the American president after Haman, the ancient Amalekite conspirator who desired the destruction of the Jewish people? That code name would be as reasonable as any, considering Ben - Gur ion's hatred for Kennedy — a modern - day Haman in his eyes. THE CONSPIRACY IS SET IN MOTION A network of assassin recruitment and planning was set in motion through the aegis of the Mossad - CIA - Lansky combine, with the shadowy Permindex entity at the very ce nter of the operation. All stood to benefit from John F. Kennedy's removal from office. Many people on the periphery of the conspiracy — indeed, perhaps even many of those at the center — did not know how or why they were being directed to undertake many of th e actions that they did that advanced the ultimate aim of removing JFK from the White House. KEY CIA PLAYERS — ALL TIED TO MOSSAD The evidence suggests that it was powerful CIA man, James Jesus Angleton — head of the CIA's Israel desk — who played the primary role in"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"360 Operation Haman? [299] manipulating the CIA's involvement in the assassination. Throughout his career, Angleton's activities had intersected with those of the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate, particularly in the CIA's dealings with the Corsican Mafia. It was Angleton' s Israeli desk at the CIA that coordinated the agency's strange alliance with the Corsican crime figures. As we have seen, anti - Castro elements in the CIA were involved in setting up the patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald. In New Orleans, the CIA's assets including Permindex board member Clay Shaw, Anti - Defamation League - linked Guy Banister and David Ferrie were coordinating anti - Castro activities among the Cuban exiles. They were critical to the plot: they were manipulating Lee Harvey Oswald, making him appear as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" Banister and Ferrie were also involved in the machinations outside New Orleans at Lake Ponchartrain of CIA operative (and Mossad asset) Frank Sturgis. Oswald is said to have trained at this camp. The WDSU media empire of the Stern fa mily — major backers of Israel's Anti - Defamation League and close friends of Permindex board member Shaw — contributed to the conspiracy by publicizing Oswald's activities and making them available to the FBI, further laying the groundwork for Oswald's identif ication as a Castro agent. THE FRENCH CONNECTION And as we saw in Chapter 15, there are further indications that CIA - linked French OAS operatives were also utilizing Guy Banister's headquarters in New Orleans. Many of these same OAS operatives also had t ies to the Lansky drug racket. They were also hostile to John F. Kennedy who had supported Algerian independence from France. What's more, it was the CIA's chief liaison to the anti - Castro Cubans, E. Howard Hunt, who was also liaison to one of the leading longtime OAS operatives, Jean Souetre, whose own alleged presence in Dallas — like that of Hunt — is the subject of some controversy. As we noted in Chapter 16, a former French intelligence officer contends that a French assassin was involved in the events in Dealey Plaza on contract for the Mossad, his presence in Dallas arranged through a faction in the French secret service, the SDECE, under the direction of Col. Georges deLannurien. THE 'DUMMY ASSASSINATION' Evidence suggests that the CIA's E. Howard Hunt may have had his own anti - Castro operation (in the guise of a faked assassination attempt on the president) underway. Oswald was likely being used in some way in this operation. However, it appears that this \"faked assassination attempt\" was manipulated a nd/or infiltrated by elements who intended, in fact, to kill the president. Perhaps Hunt himself was as surprised as anybody when those fatal shots were fired in Dallas. Maybe Hunt was, in fact, set up."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"[300] Final Judgment 361 As we have seen it was the Mossad's CIA asset and w illing collaborator, James Jesus Angleton, who sent Hunt to Dallas in November of 1963. Only Hunt can tell us just what he was doing in Dallas — or what he thought he was doing. Was Hunt — like Oswald — a patsy? Hunt himself admitted, under oath, that he believe d it possible that his former colleagues at the CIA would consider framing him for the Kennedy assassination. However, Hunt has never explained — at least publicly — what he was doing in Dallas on November 21, 1963, the day before John F. Kennedy's assassinati on. Instead, Hunt says he was not there. Longtime Mossad asset Frank Sturgis — who also doubled as a CIA contract agent — met with Hunt (and with Jack Ruby) in Dallas the day before the assassination. Later Sturgis told Marita Lorenz, that he had been involved in the assassination itself. Looking at Sturgis alone, we can thus say, without qualification, that a known Mossad asset has thus confessed to have played a direct part in the president's murder. In addition, as we have seen, various sources have suggeste d that there were at least several people operating in Dealey Plaza on November 22 who believed that they were there as part of a \"Mafia\" hit aimed not at Kennedy, but instead at Texas Governor John B. Connally The use of \"false flags,\" has been a classic Mossad tactic, a standard practice of Israel's spy agency. And as we saw in Chapter 16, according to former Mossad operative, Victor Ostrovsky, he and his fellow Mossad trainees were told by their superiors that Kennedy's assassination was, in fact, an acc ident. The real target, or so the Mossad claimed, was Connally who had been targeted by \"the Mafia.\" JACK RUBY, MICKEN COHEN AND THE MOSSAD As we saw in Chapter 13, Lansky's West Coast lieutenant Mickey Cohen — who maintained intimate ties to Israeli arms smuggling — played a bizarre role in intrigue against JFK. Cohen also had a longstanding link to Jack Ruby who was, himself, involved in smuggling arms to Israel. In fact, as we have seen, Ruby (who also trafficked in U.S. intelligence circles) was definitiv ely \"more Mossad than Mafia,\" quite in contrast to the old legends swirling about Ruby and his alleged \"Mafia connections.\" Just shortly before the JFK assassination, Al Gruber — a henchman of Mickey Cohen and a longtime Ruby friend (who hadn't seen Ruby in years) — showed up in Dallas to visit Ruby. Then, just about an hour after Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest was made public, Ruby called Gruber. It may be speculated that Ruby called Gruber to advise him that the chosen patsy had not been killed before his arrest, as planned, and that Ruby was then told it was his responsibility to finish the job. Mickey Cohen's friend and lawyer, Melvin Belli, promptly stepped in as Jack Ruby's defense counsel, further tying Ruby to the Israeli - linked Lansky - Cohen apparatus that f ew JFK researchers care to address, preferring instead to focus on Ruby's mythical \"ties to the Mafia.\""},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"362 Operation Haman? [301] It was James Jesus Angleton of the CIA who attempted to perpetrate the fraud that the Soviet KGB was behind the Kennedy assassination. Angleton veheme ntly disputed the reliability of Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko who insisted that he had been Oswald's KGB handler in the Soviet Union and who said that Oswald had not been a KGB agent. As we have seen, Angleton was — at his own insistence — the CIA's key \"point man\" in the agency's relationship with the Warren Commission. What's more, Angleton's close friend, William Sullivan, number three man at the FBI, was the FBI's liaison with the commission. It was, perhaps not coincidentally, Angleton (through a strange i n - house CIA memo) who fingered CIA man E. Howard Hunt for possible involvement in the Kennedy assassination, presumably as a \"renegade\" agent, acting on his own. This frame - up took place at precisely the time when public suspicion of the CIA's institutiona l involvement was being widely discussed. In Chapter 16 we analyzed that memorandum in detail. EARL WARREN Chief Justice Earl Warren, apprised by the CIA of possible Soviet Communist involvement in the president's murder was pressured into covering up wh at he mistakenly believed to be the truth about the assassination. The CIA's \"Mexico City scenario\" — handled by Angleton's desk at the CIA and coordinated by David Atlee Phillips, who was the CIA's Mexico City station chief at the time — was presented to Warr en as proof the Soviets were implicated in the president’s murder. Pinning the assassination on \"one lone nut\" was Warren's way of protecting America's national security. A war with Soviet Russia, Warren believed, had been prevented. Warren himself probabl y never had any idea as to the real truth — or even part of the truth — as to what really happened or where the assassination conspiracy originated. Any effort by Warren to probe deeper would no doubt have been scuttled immediately: after all, one of his fello w commission members was former CIA Director Allen Dulles who had, in fact, been fired by JFK. What's more, as we shall see in Appendix Four, there were immense and multiple Israeli (and Jewish) influences on the Warren Commission staff itself — a factor nev er considered until the release of Final Judgment. Additionally, Warren was also under the influence of his close friend, syndicated columnist Drew Pearson, himself an asset and longtime collaborator of Israel's propaganda and intelligence arm in this coun try, the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. It was Pearson who floated the blatantly fraudulent story that Fidel Castro had been the prime mover behind the JFK assassination. FALSE LEADS False trails and false leads were set in place throughout the chain of events that led up to the assassination — and afterward — a standard Mossad"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"[302] Operation Haman? 363 tactic. \"False flags\" were positioned to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Even Lyndon Johnson himself may not have known from where the order to kill Kennedy emerged, al though there have been allegations (never documented) that Johnson himself was in on the assassination planning. Johnson certainly had no reason himself to intervene or to attempt to stop the assassination from being carried out. ROBERT F. KENNEDY The as sassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy — with an Arab as the \"false flag\" — the fall guy — was a part of the continuing cover - up of the murder of President Kennedy. In the RFK assassination, as we have seen, the Iranian SAVAK — a joint creature of the CIA and th e Israeli Mossad — was responsible for coordinating the hit on the senator. Robert Kennedy's death prevented the younger Kennedy from ever bringing his brother's killers to justice. ISRAEL & THE M EDIA Researchers into the JFK assassination over the past 28 years have not, until just recently, had access to the evidence of Kennedy's secret war with Israel over the nuclear bomb. As a consequence, there has never been any suspicion that Israel — like other often - named suspects in the crime — may have had a reason to collaborate in a conspiracy against John F. Kennedy. The controlled media with its devotion to Israel, of course, has never pointed in this direction. The media has been content with promoting the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" — but the media ignores the Lansky connection. And those who go so far as to suggest that the CIA somehow had a part in the killing and the cover - up are presented as \"kooks\" and \"conspiracy theorists.\" Obviously, the full truth — all of the sordid details — will never be known. As a consequence, we must rely upon the information that we do have — information that enables us to make a final judgment. TH E IM P ACT O F TH E ASSASSINAT IO N The assassination of John F. Kennedy had a major political impact, far more profound than the simple ele vation of Lyndon Johnson to the presidency. There were several direct consequences of JFK's death — both in the U.S. and abroad:   Preservation of the CIA's autonomy;   Protection of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI empire;   A change in Vietnam policy, resulting in (a) a profit able war for Lyndon Johnson's (and Israel's) allies in the military - industrial complex; and (b) a continuing cover for ever - expanding joint CIA - Lansky drug - smuggling operations out of Southeast Asia."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"364 Operation Haman? [303]   An end to the burgeoning crackdown on the Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate; and   A drastic reversal in U.S. policy toward Israel.

In the pages of Final Judgment we have outlined, for the first time, the entirety of the conspiracy that led to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the cover - up that followed. We do not pretend to have all of the answers, but we believe that the missing link has now been supplied. Never before has the evidence been assembled as it has been in these pages. A SM ALL CIRCLE O F CO NSP IRATO RS The close connections between a relatively small circle of people and those in their immediate spheres of influence is no c oincidence. That all of them, in some fashion, were part of the circumstances surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy is also no coincidence. Critics of JFK assassination conspiracy theories contend that a conspiracy so immense would require a vas t number of people involved. In fact, the mechanics of initiating the conspiracy described in Final Judgment involved perhaps no more than 20 people. Most of those ultimately involved in the conspiracy were probably not even aware of the activities of the others who were involved. So then, let us name, for the record, those whom we believe had advance knowledge that John F. K e n n ed y w a s g o i ng t o b e k il l ed o n No vem b e r 2 2 , 1 9 6 3 .

Angleton;   French intelligence officer Georges deLannurien;   Crime Syndicate boss Me yer Lansky;   The actual shooters in Dealey Plaza. Evidence strongly points toward French mercenary Michael Mertz as one of those gunmen. In any case, as we have seen, at least one assassin was contracted by the Mossad through disloyal elements in French int elligence, although it is probable that there were several assassination teams in place.   CIA contract agent and longtime Mossad asset Frank Sturgis claimed to have played a part in the events in Dealey Plaza. His Cuban exile henchmen, Guillermo and Ignacio Novo, who were with Sturgis in Dallas"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"[304] Final Judgment 365 also played some role, although whether they were actual gunmen has yet to be determined. Although it is likely (although not certain) that Meyer Lansky's Mafia lieutenants — Santo Trafficante, Jr. of Tampa and Carlos Marcello of New Orleans — had advance knowledge of the impending assassination itself, it is not clear that they, or, for that matter, Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana or the Mafia's \"roving ambassador,\" Johnny Rosselli, were actually involved in the plannin g of the assassination itself. However, we do know today that both Giancana and Rosselli were under the thumb of Mossad - connected crime boss Hyman Lamer — and that opens up a whole new can of worms. The role of the Italian - American organized crime figures in the JFK assassination is more media - generated myth than reality. At best, they were secondary players in the bigger scheme of things. In Appendix Nine we will also consider the likely role — at least as an intermediary — that top - ranking Mossad figure Shaul E isenberg played in the events surrounding the assassination, suggesting that Eisenberg did, in fact, have advance knowledge of the impending assassination. PEOPLE ON THE PERIPHERY . . . Here are those persons who were engaged in some form of activity tha t tied them to the assassination conspiracy (whether or not they were aware that an actual assassination would indeed take place):   Lee Harvey Oswald;   CIA operative E.

Meyer Lansky's West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, and Israeli diplomat (later Prime Minister) Menachem Begin, had been involved in Israeli - related intelligenc e intrigue against President Kennedy, but it cannot be said definitively that they were cognizant of an assassination conspiracy before the fact, although it is likely that Cohen's associate Al Gruber may have given Jack Ruby the order to kill Lee Harvey O swald. Various members of the CIA, figures in the Mafia and the Lansky Syndicate, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and some investigators for the Warren Commission and the subsequent House Assassinations Committee may have gleaned some information over the ye ars as to portions of what had happened, but few would be aware of the entirety of the conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"366 Operation Haman? [305] Those on the periphery participated in various aspects of the cover - up (for their own reasons) as did certain figures in the media such as Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson, among others.

Needless to say, the existence of this memorandum p resented a problem for George Bush who had claimed to have had no prior service with the CIA prior to his appointment as director of the agency in 1976. However, Bush's spokesmen suggested that there must have been another \"George Bush\" working for the CIA at the time in question and that it was he who was referenced in the controversial Hoover memorandum. Richard McBride, the author of the Nation articles, did some checking, only to find out that there was indeed a George William Bush who had worked for th e CIA at the time — and for a very short time — and only as a low - level researcher and analyst. George William Bush told McBride that he was never part of any inter - agency briefing and knew neither of the other people referred to in the memorandum. In short, t his George Bush was not the George Bush in the memorandum. 788 INITIATION So where was George Herbert Walker Bush on November 23, 1963? Evidently working, as he had been for some time, as an operative for the Central Intelligence Agency. New research sugg ests that Bush was with the CIA as long ago as his college days at Yale. Anthony Kimery, an investigative reporter who has been researching George Bush's relationship with the CIA, notes that: \"The CIA's full - time salaried headhunter at Yale was crew coach Allen 'Skip' Waltz, a former naval intelligence officer who had a good view of Bush. As a member of Yale's Undergraduate Athletic Association and Undergraduate Board of Deacons, Bush had to have worked closely with Waltz on the university's athletic progr ams from which the coach picked most of the men he steered to the CIA. It is inconceivable Waltz didn't try to recruit Bush, say former Agency officials recruited at Yale.\" 789"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"[308] Final Judgment 369 It was while a student at Yale, of course, that Bush was a member of the s ecret Skull and Bones fraternity which has been well - known as a CIA recruiting ground for many years. (One of Bush's fellow \"Bonesmen\" is Yale man, William F. Buckley, Jr., himself a former CIA man whose own peculiar links to key players in the JFK assassi nation conspiracy were examined in Chapter 9.) GEORGE'S FIRST CIA JOB? What's more, it was another Bonesman, Henry Neil Mallon, longtime chairman of the board of Dresser Industries, based in Houston, who gave Bush his first job in the oil business. Mallo n, a classmate and close family friend of Bush's father, Senator Prescott Bush, set young Bush up as a salesman for International Derrick and Equipment Company (IDECO), a subsidiary of Dresser. However, as Anthony Kimery comments, \"Bush's job, peddling IDE CO's services, including behind the Iron Curtain, was a curious responsibility, considering Bush's inexperience in either the oil industry or international relations.\" 7 90 All of this, together, of course, suggests that Bush, in fact, was operating as a CI A asset under the cover of Dresser Industries, which, according to Kimery's sources, \"routinely served as a CIA cover.\" 791 THE TWO GEORGES It was Henr y Mallo n who apparently introduced Bush to an international petroleum engineer who later emerged as one of the genuine \"mystery men\" in the JFK assassination: Lee Harvey Oswald's friend — and suspected \"CIA handler\" — George DeMohrenschildt whose CIA connections we examined in Chapter 9. T h e t w o G e o r g e s b e c a m e s o w e l l a c q u a i n t e d , i n f a c t , t h a t DeMohrenschildt's address book not only included Bush's home address and telephone number in Midland, Texas where Bush lived from 1953 until 1959, but also the oilman's youthful nickname, \"Poppy.\" Kimery says that his sources contend that Bush and DeMohrenschildt continued to meet secretly in Houston after Bush had left Midland to set up the Houston office of his Zapata Off - Shore Oil Company. (Kimery points out that in his testimony to the Warren Commission DeMohrenschildt admitted that he made frequent trips to Houston beg inning in the late 1950's but that he gave vague explanations as to the purpose of the trips.) Kimery's research suggests that the Bush - DeMohrenschildt relationship stemmed from not only their mutual interests in the oil business, but also from their mutua l background in intelligence work.

[309] of a consulting petroleum geologist specializing in making deals between U.S. oil companies and the East - bloc nations to which [DeMohrenschildt] was remarkably well - connected.\" 792 As a consequence, then, it is thus not surprising that CIA asset George Bush, w orking in the Eastern bloc in the oil business and CIA asset George DeMohrenschildt, working in the Eastern bloc in the oil business, would have ultimately come together. According to former CIA official Victor Marchetti (who specialized in Soviet affairs for the CIA), \"It's inconceivable that the CIA didn't debrief Bush after each and every meeting [Bush had with East bloc representatives]. \"Businessmen with dealings like [Bush had] were routinely debriefed.\" 793 All of these dealings between Bush and DeMoh renschildt would appear to be innocent behind - the - scenes intrigue between two spies named George if it weren't for the fact that the more one traces Bush's connections, the more one finds that the CIA man is enmeshed all the more deeply in the circumstance s surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. THE ANTI - CASTRO OPERATIONS For instance, the evidence strongly suggests that Bush, in fact, was a major player in the CIA's drive to destroy Fidel Castro. According to Anthony Kimery, \"Veteran CIA opera tives in the war against Castro say Bush not only let the CIA use Zapata as a front for running some of its operations (including the use of several off - shore drilling platforms), but assert that Bush personally served as a conduit through which the Agency disbursed money for contracted services.\" 794 Kimery contends that he has several sources who contend, independently, that Bush was indeed deeply involved in CIA operations, particularly in the Caribbean and in the campaign against Castro. This seems to ji be with information provided by Col. Fletcher Prouty who points out that not only was the CIA's top - secret code name for the Bay of Pigs invasion \"Operation Zapata\" (as in Bush's company) but that two of the ships utilized in the operation were christened the Houston (Bush's home base) and the Barbara (Bush's wife's name). 795 Bush's connections to the CIA's operations against Castro go even deeper, however. According to Kimery, \"There is evidence that prior to Bush's appointment as DCI in 1976, he was well - acquainted with legendary spook Theodore George \"Ted\" Shackley who joined the Agency in 1951. When Bush arrived on the scene at Langley, it was clear to longtime Agency insiders that there was a bond between these two men that went back many years. \" 796 This, of course, is the same Theodore Shackley whom we first met in Chapter 8 as a friend of Israel's secret nuclear development program. It was Shackley who served as CIA Station Chief in Miami, then the largest CIA station in the world, and the base of t he CIA's operations against Castro being jointly conducted with Meyer Lansky's syndicate henchmen."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"[310] Final Judgment 371 (It is worth noting, if only in passing, that the Israeli Mossad itself maintains one of its largest North American bases in Miami — the longtime headquarter s of its organized crime collaborator — Meyer Lansky.) 797 It was from the CIA's base in Miami, we learned from former CIA operative Marita Lorenz (in Chapter 9 and in Chapter 16) that a two - car caravan carrying anti - Castro Cubans and several CIA figures was dispatched to Dallas, arriving just prior to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Kimery quotes a former CIA operative who was involved in the anti - Castro operations: \"You've got ole George baby helping the Company's operation against Castro an d here's Shackley in charge of the Miami station that's running that show. Now how do you think they know each other my friend? Their's was a damn close relationship — still is.\" 798 And, as we noted in Chapter 12, it was Shackley, again, who was the CIA's c hief of station for the CIA in Laos during the Vietnam War — this during a period when the CIA and the Lansky syndicate were jointly engaged in lucrative drug - running operations. Kimery points out that, \"In 1976, shortly after he became DCI, without seeking advice, Bush promoted Shackley to Associate Deputy Director of Operations. In this position, he was second in command to the [Deputy Director of Operations] — the third most powerful position in the CIA and one of the most pivotal in the entire government.\" 799 THE MOSSAD CONNECTION After leaving the CIA, as we noted in Chapter 12, Bush's friend Shackley later went into the international arms business and worked closely with the Aviation Trade and Service Company, a creation of Israeli Mossad figure Shaul E isenberg. Bush himself, however, was also developing intimate ties with Israel, ties which, of course, had been cemented during his service as CIA director. In 1979, then Republican presidential candidate Bush attended the Jerusalem Conference on Internati onal Terrorism, an event hosted by the Israeli government and attended by most of Israel's top intelligence officials. The delegates to the conference from the United States were all tried - and - true friends of Israel, Democrat and Republican alike. 800 Accom panying Bush were Major General George Keegan, former chief of intelligence for the U.S. Air Force, and Harvard Professor Richard Pipes. Keegan and Pipes were part of an elite group formed by Bush while serving as CIA director that operated under the name \"Team B.\" 801 Bush's Team B was a new, secret supervisory body for the CIA empowered to re - evaluate, criticize or dismiss the CIA's intelligence reports. Significantly, however, Team B was composed of a clique of high - level officials who were bound togeth er primarily by their devotion to advancing Israel's interests. Among the more notable members included Richard Perle, who ultimately became assistant secretary of defense in charge of international"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"372 Where Was George? [311] security policy and Perle's longtime associate, Stephen Bryen, a former Senate staff member who was forced to resign his post after it was discovered that he had passed U.S. defense secrets to Israel's Mossad. 802 That Bush should have been affiliated so closely with this select group of devotees of Israel is intriguing, particularly in light of Bush's subsequent conflicts with Israel's Mossad, which we first examined in Chapter 2. THE COVER - UP For his own part, it was while Bush served as CIA Director that the Senate Intelligence Committee was probing the co nnections between Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald, the CIA, organized crime and the anti - Castro operations conducted by the CIA and its mob collaborators. As Anthony Kimery comments: \"With his own ties to those operations, Bush was now in charge of what the C IA would and wouldn't divulge.\" \"As DCI [Bush] frustrated committee investigator's requests for specific information in the Agency's files on Oswald and Ruby and downplayed revelations about CIA involvement. Memoranda written by Bush on the intelligence co mmittee's investigation of Oswald's and Ruby's links to the CIA and organized crime show he was especially interested in the committee's probing not only of what the CIA knew about the events in Dallas and didn't report to the Warren Commission, but to wha t extent, if any, the Agency was complicit in Kennedy's murder.\" 803 Kimery quotes an ex - CIA contract agent and Bay of Pigs veteran who claims to have been associated with Bush in the CIA's anti - Castro operations in the early 1960's: \"Bush was worried abou t something during those investigations when he was DCI, all right. He was worried it was going to be found out that he worked for the Company and was tied right into all the messes the CIA was in during the late 50s and early 60s.\" 804 David Robb, writing in Spy magazine points out that although Bush was asked in January of 1992 whether or not he had looked into the JFK assassination during the time he was CIA director that Bush said, \"No, I didn't have any curiosity . . .\" 805 However, Robb has pinpointed a September 15, 1976 memo to the Deputy Director for Central Intelligence which reads as follows: \"A recent Jack Anderson story referred to a November 1963 (?) CIA cable, the subject matter of which had some UK journalist observing Jack Ruby visiting [Santo ] Trafficante in jail. Is there such a cable? If so I would like to see it. This is the same cable that Mike Hadigan, Minority Counsel for the SSC [Senate Select Committee] had asked for.\" 806 The memo was signed \"GB\" above the typewritten name \"George Bus h.\" Clearly, George Bush was just a bit more curious about the inquiries into the JFK assassination than he would have us believe. A THREAT AGAINST JFK?"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"[312] Final Judgment 373 And, curiously enough, there is this interesting tidbit unearthed by Spy magazine suggesting that B ush had an inordinate interest in John F. Kennedy's welfare. According to Spy : \"Internal FBI memos indicate that on November 22, 1963, 'reputable businessman' George H. W. Bush `telephonically advised that he wanted to relate some hearsay that he had heard in recent weeks, date and source unknown. He advised that one James Parrott has been talking of killing the president when he comes to Houston.\" 807 Parrott was a 24 - year - old Young Republican who regularly picketed Kennedy administration officials when th ey came to Houston. The FBI also learned that the Secret Service had been told — in 1961 — that Parrott had said he \"would kill President Kennedy if he ever got near him.\" Parrott denies the charges. Spy asks — not entirely satirically — \"Was Bush just being a mis guided do - good weenie? Or was he trying to throw the FBI off the trail?\" 808 ISRAEL AGAIN . . . It was after George Bush left the CIA in 1977 that he continued to maintain close ties with business interests which had, in turn, intimate ties to Israel a nd its lobby in this country. Returning home to Houston, Bush was named to serve as executive committee chairman of the First International Bank of Houston, the family - owned enterprise of the heirs of Texas billionaire H. L. Hunt. The Hunts were owners of a 15% controlling interest in Gulf Resources and Chemical Corporation, a Houston based company which controlled half the world's supply of lithium, which is an essential component in the production of hydrogen bombs. Among the board members of Gulf Resourc es was George A. Butler, chairman of Houston's Post Oak Bank, controlled by one W. S. Farish, III, often described as one of Bush's closest confidants. Gulf Resources had taken over the Lithium Corporation of America as a wholly - owned subsidiary some years previously. Among the directors of both Gulf Resources and the Lithium Corporation was John Roger Menke, who was also a director of Israel's Hebrew Technical Institute. All of this is significant in that it was during this period that Israel was continuin g in its secret development of nuclear weaponry, the most monumental issue of conflict between John F. Kennedy and Israeli prime minister David Ben - Gurion, discussed in detail in Chapter 5. 809 THE ADL AGAIN Perhaps, then, it is no surprise that Robert Allen, the chairman of Gulf R e s o u r c e s — a n o n - J e w n o t k n o w n a s a c o n t r i b u t o r t o J e w i s h causes — received the so - called \"Torch of Liberty\" award from the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, the self - styled \"civil rights\""},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"374 Where Was George? [313] organization that functions as an American intelligence arm for Israel's Mossad. (It was in Chapter 8 that we first met another Torch of Liberty recipient, gangster Morris Dalitz, a longtime top - level associate of Meyer Lansky and an investor in the shadowy Permindex corporation whic h, as we saw in Chapter 15, played the central role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. ) It is also probably worth pointing out that another director of both Gulf Resources and Lithium Corp. was Samuel H. Rogers who was, in turn a director of industriali st Dwayne Andreas' Archer Daniel Midland Corp. 810 The aforementioned Andreas, it just so happens, has been a major financial backer of the ADL for many years and has been a close associate of two major national ADL officials, Burton Joseph, ADL national ch airman from 1976 - 1978 and Max M. Kampelman, a national ADL honorary vice chairman. 811 All of this taken together places George Bush in the center of a wide - ranging network of international corporate bodies with long - standing ties to Israel and its major ba ckers — including one corporation with a particular interest in the development of nuclear weaponry. The Hunt connection, which brings the complex series of inter - relationships full circle, is also interesting, inasmuch as, for years, JFK assassination resea rchers, have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to pinpoint the late H. L. Hunt as the mastermind behind the JFK assassination, presumably driven by his hard - line conservative opposition to Kennedy's progressive domestic and foreign policy stands. What those wh o have been pointing the finger at Hunt have failed to do, however, is to trace Hunt's connection back to the Gulf Resources Corp. with its own intimate links to Israel. These facts do not prove or disprove a role by either H. L. Hunt or George Bush — togeth er or alone — in the JFK assassination conspiracy. However, they do pinpoint the strange — and little - noticed — role played by Israel and its high - level backers in the ever - converging circles surrounding the JFK assassination conspiracy. For the record they need to be noted. WHERE WAS GEORGE? In any case, Bush's closest associates during his CIA years, as we have seen, and his activities, have all repeatedly bound Bush to circumstances which tie together the CIA and the Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate in joint ventures not only in the Castro assassination plots of the early 1960's, but the joint CIA - Lansky drug - running operations in Southeast Asia. Bush's own ties to the Israeli lobby thus cement the circle. The evidence we have reviewed here suggests tha t perhaps George Bush does indeed know more about the assassination of John F. Kennedy than he might be willing to admit. Whether Bush will ever tell what he knows is another matter entirely."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"APPENDIX TWO The M an From the Klan Lee Harvey Oswald's \"Nazi\" Connection The Alleged Assassin's Little - Known Ties to Undercover Intelligence Operatives in the Neo - Nazi Underground A m o n g t h o s e w h o s e n a m e s a p p e a r e d i n L e e H a r v e y O s w a l d ' s a d d r e s s b o o k w a s o n e D a n i e l B u r r o s .

The story of Lee Harvey Oswald's possible connection to Daniel Burros has never been explored in any other work on the JFK assassination. Yet, the evidence, as we shall see , suggests that there is much more to the Oswald - Burros connection than meets the eye. Although JFK assassination researchers have long been busy compiling, recompiling, editing and re - editing lists of \"mysterious deaths\" among people with links — both real and perhaps sometimes imagined — to the JFK assassination, Burros' name never pops up. The circumstances of Dan Burros' death were quite bizarre. Just one day before the \"Nazi\" leader died in October of 1965, he had been publicly exposed in the New York Time s as having been born to Jewish parents. This expose was the ostensible trigger that led to Burro's \"suicide\" at the Reading, Pennsylvania home of his fellow \"Nazi,\" Roy Frankhauser. Although Burro's death was trumpeted in the media as the story of a nice Jewish boy gone haywire, the fact is that some members of the American Nazi underground have long felt that Burros was not a Jewish apostate, but, instead, an active informant and agent provocateur of the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith operat ing within the ranks of the so - called \"racist right.\" In his short career in the political underworld, Dan Burros is known to have indeed been closely associated with ADL undercover informants and was perhaps such an informant himself, although it is unlik ely that the full truth will ever be known. What is known, however, is that Burros was a key figure in the New York City - based National Renaissance Party, a small neo - Nazi entity"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"376 The Man From the Klan [315] founded by the late James H. Madole. Although Madole was apparently a dyed - in - the - wool Nazi, it is an established fact that his organization was infiltrated, funded in part and manipulated by agents of the ADL's undercover spy apparatus. The ADL's operative inside the NRP was one Emmanuel Trujillo who also went by the name Mana T ruhill. In turn, Truhill worked closely with Sanford Griffith, then the ADL's chief spymaster. Two \"right wing\" activists of the 1950s era — author Eustace Mullins and businessman DeWest Hooker (referenced in Chapter 4) — have confirmed to this author that the ADL was indeed active in \"infiltrating\" rightist groups at the time and that the aforementioned Griffith was a familiar figure moving in and out of the right - wing orbit during the period. During the heyday of Madole's ADL - manipulated organization well - kno wn maverick New York publisher Lyle Stuart publicly accused the ADL of financing American Nazi groups — such as Madole's outfit — for its own insidious ends. That Daniel Burros was himself deeply a part of this unusual circle being manipulated by the ADL is an intriguing fact. But there's much more to the story of the Oswald - Burros connection. Some JFK assassination researchers have focused on New Orleans private detective and CIA contract agent Guy Banister's ties to Robert DePugh and the paramilitary group kn own as the Minutemen as proof that \"right wing extremists\" were perhaps behind the JFK assassination. As we noted in some detail in Chapter 15, however, there is strong evidence to suggest that Banister was also being deployed by the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith in its own \"fact - finding\" operations aimed against left - leaning civil rights groups. The evidence regarding the Minutemen, however, suggests that the Minutemen were, for all intents and purposes, a government - infiltrated — perhaps eve n government - controlled — \"right wing extremist\" outfit. It is the Minutemen link that opens up the door in the Oswald - Burros connection to some highly unusual facts about a strange individual named Roy Frankhauser who just happens to have been associated wi th both Oswald and Burros. John George and Laird Wilcox, in Nazis, Communists, Klansmen, and Others on the Fringe, have provided us with a wealth of information about Frankhauser's operations inside the Minutemen in particular. Here's what George and Wilco x wrote about the government's infiltration of the Minutemen and the role of the Roy Frankhauser. The extended direct quotation from George and Wilcox follows: \"The Minutemen, in fact, were among the most thoroughly infiltrated of all domestic far right gr oups. According to Eric Norden, in his long essay on the paramilitary right appearing in the June 1969 issue of Playboy magazine, virtually all of the major Minutemen cases were cracked with the assistance of government infiltrators and informants. \"One of these informants was a nightmare named Roy Frankhauser, a professional government infiltrator whose alliance with [Robert] DePugh [of"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"[316] Final Judgment 377 the Minutemen] began in the early 1960s, shortly after the organization was formed. Frankhauser was well - known for havi ng taken the Fifth Amendment thirty - three times when questioned about his Ku Klux Klan involvement by the House Un - American Activities Committee in 1965. Unaware of Frankhauser's role, Norden interviewed him extensively for his article. Frankhauser, whom D ePugh had made a regional coordinator, portrayed the Minutemen to Norden as a neo - Nazi organization to be feared and reckoned with: \"'Hitler had the Jews; we've got the niggers. We have to put our main stress on the nigger question, of course, because that 's what preoccupies the masses — but were not forgetting the Jew. If the Jews knew what was coming — and believe me, it's coming as surely as the dawn — they'd realize that what's going to happen in America will make Nazi Germany look like a Sunday - school picnic . We'll build better gas chambers, and more of them, and this time there won't be any refugees.' \"Norden notes that Frankhauser, having made this statement, 'paused and seemed to brood for a few seconds,' and then continued: 'Of course, there are some good Jews, you know, Jews like Dan Burros, who was a friend of mine. Yeah, print that some of my best friends are Jews. Dan Burros was one of the most patriotic, dedicated Americans you'll ever meet in your life.' \"Norden commented: 'Frankhauser fell silent. B urros was a fanatic American Nazi who served as [George Lincoln] Rockwell's [American Nazi party] lieutenant for years, then resigned in 1962 to edit a magazine called Kill and finally became a Klan leader. He had rushed into Frankhauser's house in October 1965 brandishing an issue of the New York Times that exposed his Jewish ancestry, snatched a loaded pistol from the wall and blew his brains out.' \"What Norden did not say is that some conspiracy buffs believe that Frankhauser may have had more than a cas ual involvement in the killing, although no determination of that fact was ever made and the death was ruled a suicide. Another theory, also not confirmed, is that Frankhauser may have encouraged Burros' suicide inasmuch as his cover had been blown. Burros died from three bullet wounds, unusual in a bona fide suicide. DePugh, who examined the gun, said it was unlikely that Burros killed himself. \"Other Frankhauser associates have ventured related opinions. What is also possible is that in 1965 Frankhauser w as working as a government informant and that Dan Burros was too, perhaps reporting to Frankhauser. At the time of this writing Frankhauser still resides in the Reading, Pennsylvania, house where the death occurred; blood stains are still imbedded in the c eiling. \"But was Frankhauser a government informant and agent provocateur so early in his career? Frankhauser denies it, but his own U.S. Army records suggest otherwise. During an extensive interview under oath that took place during the period July 13 to 18, 1957, Army records reveal the following: \" ' (FRANKHAUSER) made a decision to infiltrate organizations such as the Neo - Nazi Party, the Communist Party, and the Ku Klux Klan, to determine their motives, identify the leaders, and report this information t o"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"378 The Man From the Klan [317] the proper intelligence agency of the United States Government if their aims were ascertained to be inimical to the interest of the United States. FRANKHAUSER advised he had created a cover story which included causing people to think he was a true Com munist or Nazi and the creation of an organization which was to be a large, well - organized unit, but which was composed of only one man — FRANKHAUSER. FRANKHAUSER'S aim at Fort Bragg was to get the Klans of the North together with the Klans of the South to g ive the United States government the opportunity to destroy these organizations.' \"During the 1960s, Minutemen were involved in three major terrorist acts in which Frankhauser was the possible informant, directly or indirectly, who tipped off the FBI. \"In 1973, after DePugh was released from prison, Frankhauser became head of Minutemen intelligence . . . During October 1973 DePugh was a featured speaker at Liberty Lobby's annual Board of Policy meeting in Kansas City, Missouri. He had been released from pri son six months earlier. Frankhauser, as security director, was his constant companion and lived with the DePugh family in Norborne [Missouri] for several weeks — all the time working for the ATF as an undercover informant. \"Roy Frankhauser's background is mu ch more convoluted. According to U.S. Army documents released under the Freedom of Information Act in 1988, Frankhauser was enmeshed in deep personal problems long before he entered the army. The victim of a broken home and an alcoholic mother, and regarde d by school officials and various employers as emotionally unstable and unreliable, he enlisted in the U.S. Army on November 6, 1956. Long a collector of Nazi memorabilia and a Ku Klux Klan sympathizer even as a young man, he was engaged in a number of hal f - baked plots that immediately brought him to the attention of army authorities. \"Military reports specified that Frankhauser joined the army and volunteered for airborne duty in order to be assigned to Germany. He developed a scheme to have himself declar ed officially dead so he could leave the army and join the neo - Nazi movement, hoping to rise to a position of prominence. \"On July 2, 1957, Frankhauser stated that he planned to desert the U.S. Army and join the revolutionary forces in Cuba. In fact, he we nt AWOL and arrived in Miami, Florida, on July 5, 1957, to do precisely that. He was taken into custody shortly thereafter and returned to his military unit. Army records reflect that Frankhauser was discharged on November 18, 1957, under the provisions of AR - 635209 (unfit for military service). \"Frankhauser's rather incredible role as a government informant is well - documented. It first came to light in July 1975 when the Washington Star reported on his role in an undercover operation in Canada authorized by the top - secret National Security Council, Frankhauser was assigned to infiltrate the 'Black September' terrorist organization. The CBS Evening News of July 28, 1975, did a feature on Frankhauser during which announcer Fred Graham noted that:"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"[318 ] Final Judgment 379 \"'Sworn t estimony by federal agents [maintains] that Frankhauser has carried out a series of undercover missions for the government, including one approved by the National Security Council in the White House. — One government source said Frankhauser had an uncanny a bility to penetrate both right - and left - wing groups, that he could still help convict those who supplied the explosives that blew up school buses in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1971.' \"Frankhauser eventually ran afoul of his ATF superiors by going too far with his entrapment schemes and not clearing them with the ATF beforehand. This brought about his eventual indictment on February 28, 1974, on charges of stealing explosives, at which time he used his relationship with the agency as a defense. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to a period of probation, after which the ATF had a way of enforcing his cooperation and curbing his erratic behavior (or so it thought). An FBI teletype dated June 17, 1974, revealed: \"'Frankhauser has proposed through his attorne y that if allowed to plead guilty and receive probation on current bombing charges he will introduce federal agents to individuals who have approached him regarding his activities.' \"Frankhauser's ATF 'handler,' Edward N. Slamon, had written several intern al memos describing Frankhauser as 'an excellent infiltrator and confidential informant,' according to the Washington Star. \"Roy Frankhauser's involvement as a government undercover operative and agent provocateur began in the 1960s and continued sporadica lly until 1986, when he was indicted along with Lyndon LaRouche and several other defendants in the Boston LaRouche case involving credit card fraud and other charges. Frankhauser, who made his first contact with the LaRouche organization in 1975, had beco me their director of security! On December 10, 1987, Frankhauser was convicted of plotting to obstruct a federal investigation of the group.\"' 812 [END OF QUOTE] All of this intrigue is interesting, of course. The fact that Dan Burros died under myster ious circumstances in the home of a long - time covert operative is likewise quite interesting. It is probably relevant to note that one JFK assassination researcher, Peter Dale Scott, has long put forth the contention that Lee Harvey Oswald \"working for a p rivate investigator on federal government contract, was investigating the use of interstate mails for illegal arms sales [and has noted that] . . . the American Nazi Party, in 1963, was being investigated by the U.S. government . . . for its mail - order pur chase of firearms.\" 813 That Oswald was perhaps in contact with Burros (and there have been unsubstantiated rumors that Oswald himself may have been in the Washington, D.C. area — specifically Arlington, Virginia where Burros and the American Nazi Party were headquartered) and that Burros was in turn closely associated with a BATF undercover informant adds to the relevance of Scott's contention. However, as we noted in Chapter 15, it is more than likely that Oswald was, in fact, under deployment — through the of fice of"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"380 The Man From the Klan [319] Guy Banister — by the ADL which, in turn, reported regularly to the FBI and other government agencies. It is known, based upon official Justice Department documents that have been released under the Freedom of Information Act, that Frankhauser's go vernment - sponsored undercover activities — on at least one occasion — were financed by a Jewish community organization. In that instance, the Jewish Community Center of Reading, Pennsylvania. 814 So the likelihood that the ADL also had a hand in Frankhauser's activities is very strong indeed. But the plot thickens. There is an even more explosive Frankhauser link to the JFK assassination. FRANKHAUSER AND OSWALD What no JFK assassination researchers have ever yet pointed out, with one exception, is that the sa me Roy Frankhauser claimed to have met several times with not only Lee Harvey Oswald but also John and Ruth Paine, the Texas couple who played a key role in the final months of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. An article regarding Frankhauser's Oswald connec tion written by Scott M. Thompson and published in the November 20, 1975 issue of New Solidarity magazine is republished here in pertinent part. Inclusion of this material is in no way intended by the author of Final Judgment to serve as an endorsement of the information related therein, but is simply provided so that there may be as complete a record as possible of all the little - known areas involving JFK assassination conspiracy research which can be examined by independent - minded individuals who are trul y interested in finding out the truth. The article (from which the following is an extended quotation) states: \"In a series of exclusive interviews with IPS over the past month, former National Security Council operative Roy Frankhauser has provided inform ation which conclusively demonstrates that the National Security Council planned and coordinated the Nov. 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Frankhauser provided details of numerous assassination teams organized for the Kennedy and other oper ations by known agents of the CIA and FBI within groups ranging from the left - wing Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the Communist Party (USA) to right - wing groups such as the para - military Minutemen. \"Also included in the preparations for the assassinatio n were Cuban exile groups (Gusanos), the American Nazi Party, and such top CIA agents as G. Gordon Liddy, Frank Sturgis, and E. Howard Hunt, the convicted Watergate burglar and close associate of William F. Buckley. In early 1963, Frankhauser told IPS, 'th e word came down to get Kennedy and agent - led teams began to spring up all over the place.' \"Frankhauser confirms that two agents within the SWP periphery, who also had close ties to the Communist Party USA, were a direct part of the Kennedy operation. Fra nkhauser met the two, Ruth and John Paine, in 1960, when he was infiltrating the SWP in New York as an agent for the"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"[320] Final Judgment 381 Mississippi White Citizens Council and for then Mississippi Governor Patterson. Both Paines have been closely linked to Lee Harvey Oswald (who described himself as the 'patsy' in the Kennedy killing moments before he was shot in the Dallas jail) by both the Warren Commission and by independent investigators of the assassination. \"In the months preceding the assassination, the Paines lived w ith Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas. It was Ruth Paine who constructed Oswald's 'radical' cover. She was the one who drove Oswald to Mexico City so that he could be photographed by the CIA in front of the Soviet Embassy. She also took Oswald to New Orleans where together they opened a franchise of the SWP front, Fair Play for Cuba, with the approval of SWP national leaders. \"In New York, the Paines had recruited Frankhauser to a secret paramilitary 'leftist' organization after a number of casual meet ings at SWP functions. They told Frankhauser that the group had three goals: 1) to break Martin Luther King out of jail should he be arrested; 2) to kill Alabama Sheriff 'Bull' Connor, then a notorious opponent of integration; and 3) to assassinate Preside nt Eisenhower if revolution could not be fomented `legally.'

VAN LOMAN AND THE JIM HARRIS CONNECTION The author is indebted to Van Loman, who brought the magnitude of the little - noticed Oswald - Burros connection to my attention. Loman himself has his own unusual connection to the netherworld of intelligence. As a teenager Loman adop ted as his father figure and mentor a cagey and colorful Cincinnati, Ohio - based roustabout named Jim Harris whose remarkably checkered career came to an end with his death in December of 1994. Although Harris publicly postured as the Grand Dragon of the Oh io Ku Klux Klan, he was, in fact, a long - time informant for J. Edgar Hoover's FBI and a self - described contract agent for the CIA, actively collaborating in the CIA - Mafia plots against Castro — and perhaps more. Among Harris' key associates was none other th an Roy Frankhauser, his fellow intelligence operative. It was through Harris that Loman met Roy Frankhauser many years ago. Thanks indeed to Van Loman for pointing out the significance of the Oswald - Burros connection. To dig too deeply into this little - exp lored area will, inevitably, begin turning up rocks under which the tentacles of the ADL and its collaborators in American intelligence lie hidden. This perhaps explains why some JFK assassination researchers have avoided this unpleasant mystery altogether . This author believes that the Oswald - Burros connection is indeed another avenue that JFK assassination investigators should explore further and one which, in the end, adds further compelling evidence that solidifies the foundation upon which our final ju dgment is based."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Photo Section 384 Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion and President John F.

Angleton’s confidant, journalist Joe Trento (right), believes Angleton sent Hunt to Dallas in Novembe r of 1963 and then — 15 years later — leaked a CIA memo placing Hunt in Dallas at the time of the assassination. Hunt was working with many of those involved in the assassination and knows far more than he will admit. Hunt seems to have been part of what some thought was a “dummy” assassination attempt on JFK designed to implicate agents of Castro, but which was co - opted and turned into “the real thing.” It is likely Lee Oswald was manipulated in this fashion, led to believe he was involved in a scheme to blame Castro for an attempt on JFK’s life, when, in fact, he was being set up as “the patsy.” Although CIA - connected British writer Christopher Andrew asserts the famous letter to “Dear Mr. Hunt” (left) — purportedly written by Lee Oswald two weeks before the JFK assas - sination — was a KGB forgery, this letter was more likely part of the “limited hangout” cam - paign by James Angleton’s Mossad desk at the CIA to frame Hunt and confuse JFK research further. The letter came to light at precisely the time in 1975 that Mike Canfield and Alan Weberman were releasing Coup d’etat in America (right) which promoted the myth Hunt was one of the “tramps” picked up in Dallas after the assassination.

In the June 19, 1965 edition of his Capsule News, Bealle reported tha t Welch had declared Bealle’s book, The Guns of the Regressive Right — which pointed a finger in the direction of the CIA — “all wrong” and told his Birch follow ers that it was not the CIA but Lyndon John son behind the JFK assassination.

The award arrived just after Farah began promoting a new book entitled Trian gle of Death: The Shocking Truth About the Role of South Vietnam and the French Mafi a in the Assassination of JFK. Although, in some respects, the authors echoed Michael Collins Piper research about the “French connection” to the JFK conspiracy, Farah’s writers studiously avoided mentioning the multiple Mossad links that can be found thou gh the “French” connection.

JFK assassination researchers (particularly those of what might be deemed \"the liberal stripe\") have devoted much time and energy to \"detecting\" the \"right - wing extremist\" connections of various parties (both guilty and innocent) who have been connected to the JFK assassination conspiracy in one form or another. Those researchers who do agree that f ormer FBI agent and CIA contract operative Guy Banister of New Orleans did have some peculiar role in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald as the \"patsy\" in the assassination are fond of citing Banister's \"right wing\" connections. Most often noted is Banister's co nnection to a flamboyant couple — vigorous anti - communists — Kent and Phoebe Courtney, founders of an organization known as the Conservative Society of America. Mrs. Courtney is even said to have ordered her steaks \"Communist Blood Red,\" for which we thank her for the title of this appendix. The Courtneys reportedly claimed after the assassination that Oswald had tried to get employment on their newspaper, The Independent American during his sojourn in New Orleans the summer before the assassination. 816 Presuma bly, it would seem, for the \"pro - Castro\" Oswald to spy on his anti - communist rivals. However, what is most often pointed out by the liberal researchers seeking to find a \"right wing conspiracy\" behind JFK's assassination is that after Banister's death, at least a portion of his personal files came into Kent Courtney's possession. 817 This, in fact, may be significant — although certainly the \"liberal\" researchers clearly wouldn't understand why, inasmuch as their evident bias and lack of understanding of the dynamics of the political mazes of the American \"right\" precludes any such understanding. That having been said, why, then, is Courtney's receipt of Banister's files significant in light of the thesis outlined in the pages of Final Judgment?"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"[324] Final Judgment 421 The fact is that for several years prior to the assassination of President Kennedy (and up until this day) many veterans of the American \"right\" generally believed that Kent and Phoebe Courtney were active \"infiltrators\" of the right wing — paid agents — of the Anti - Defam ation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, the American intelligence arm of Israel's Mossad. Although the Courtneys were — like Banister — outspoken anti - communists, they had engendered much distrust and dissension among their fellow \"conservatives\" by actively oppos ing and attacking figures on the \"right\" who had been accused of \"anti - Semitism\" by the ADL. Perhaps the most notable and most readily documentable instance of this came in 1960 when a wide - ranging group of American conservatives were gearing up to form a third party to compete in the 1960 presidential election. Prior to that meeting, Mrs. Courtney sent out letters to some 30 different persons and organizations advising them that they were not welcome at the so - called \"New Party\" meeting. All of those in qu estion targeted by Mrs. Courtney were persons and organizations that had been scored for \"anti - Semitism\" by the ADL. Mrs. Courtney's action, needless to say, created much controversy among conservative circles, and in the February 1960 issue of Right, a cl earinghouse for news and views in the \"right wing\" movement, Verne P. Kaub, the president of the American Council on Christian Laymen, released an \"Open Letter to Phoebe Courtney\" responding to her allegation that \"haters\" — or so Mrs. Courtney alleged — had \" infiltrated patriotic organizations for the purpose of creating dissension.\" 818 Kaub responded to Mrs. Courtney, saying: \"Exactly the reverse is true. These people are not haters. The infiltrators are representatives of Communist and Zionist organizations and influences. It is these forces of deception and dissension . . . which raise the false cry of anti - Semitism, thus resorting to the worst possible form of bigotry. \"Frankly,\" Kaub told Mrs. Courtney, \"I thought you were much too smart to believe that yo u could fool patriotic Americans into accepting falsehood as truth by completely 'reversing the picture' and attempting to make it appear that the ADL smear bund, for example, is a lily - white organization of patriots, when, as you well know, ADL is . . . b randing all true Christian patriots as Nazi and Anti - Semite.\" For its own part, Right editorially commented further: \"That the Courtneys are kosher - controlled is plain. Courtney has admitted that he will take 'all the money I can get my hands on' from 'Jew ish left - wing sources.' Furthermore, the New York publishers, Simon & Schuster, are alleged to contribute to the Courtneys, and Phoebe does not deny this charge. This outfit is as Red as they come, and merely a front for the Anti - Defamation League. When th e ADL pays the piper, it calls the tune.\" 819 In fact, there were widespread rumors within the \"right wing\" that not only were the Courtneys financed by the Stern family of New Orleans, but also that Mrs. Courtney was related to the Sterns. Paquita DeShish mareff, a veteran \"right wing\" leader, was among those who believed this to be true,"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"422 “Communist Blood Red” [325] but there were many others. 82 0 In any case, the rumors reflect the general \"right wing\" perception of where the Courtneys were coming from. OSWALD's ADL - FBI CONNECTION( S) In Chapter 15, of course, we examined Guy Banister's own close association with A. I. (Bee) Botnick, the self - described \"super communist hunter\" who headed the Stern family - financed New Orleans office of the ADL. We also considered the very real possib ility that Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in New Orleans were, in fact, part of an ADL \"fact finding\" operation contracted out by the ADL to Banister's private detective agency. In this context, then, it is thus appropriate to recall other interesting deta ils that have been lost in the debate over who was manipulating Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. In 1962, Ned Touchstone, editor of the Bossier Press in Bossier City, Louisiana, investigated the bombing of a black Masonic lodge in Louisiana. While the rest of the media portrayed the crime as the act of the KKK, Touchstone believed that since most of the KKK leaders in the area were Masons that it was unlikely they would destroy a Masonic lodge. Although the FBI tried to int imidate him into dropping his investigation, Touchstone learned of \"the crooked hair pilot,\" 821 (later identified as Banister associate David Ferrie) who landed a plane in the area prior to the bombing. Thus, a year prior to the JFK assassination Touchston e concluded Ferrie had been working as an agent of the FBI's COINTELPRO in association with Banister's ADL contact, Botnick, who was indeed working closely with the FBI in connection with the bombing. However, by March 15, 1964 , Touchstone had independentl y pinpointed Ferries connection to the JFK assassination 822 all the more pertinent because of Ferries ties to both Oswald and Banister. Although such would - be conspiracy debunkers as the CIA - connected Gerald Posner (author of Case Closed ) have sought to d eny that Oswald had any connections with CIA contract operative David Ferrie there is photographic evidence refuting Posner and the debunkers. There has now been discovered a 1955 photograph of a young Oswald in the company of Ferrie, then Oswald's command er in the Civil Air Patro1. 823 Yet Touchstone's discoveries have remain suppressed precisely (or, at least in part) because they pointed directly toward the ADL's ties to these key figures in the JFK assassination conspiracy who were, in turn, also linked to the intrigue of both the FBI and the CIA in the same time frame. And although there's been discussion of the possibility that Oswald was an FBI informant of some sort and of what relationship he had with Dallas FBI agent James Hosty, it has finally been reported by Ray and Mary LaFontaine, authors of Oswald Talked, that Hosty was \"an investigator of right - wing groups\" 824 and \"right - wing subversives.\" 825 Thus, there can be no doubt that Hosty, in fact, was working closely with the Anti - Defamation Leagu e, one of the FBI's most valued \"sources\""},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"[326] Final Judgment 423 of information on \"right wing groups\" and \"right - wing subversives.\" The ADL most assuredly would have been one of Hosty's primary contacts. So not only do we have Guy Banister and David Ferrie, both closely conne cted to the ADL, working with Oswald in New Orleans prior to the assassination, but we also find an ADL - connected FBI agent in Dallas (Hosty) engaged in some sort of intrigue with Oswald, the actual details of which will probably never be known. So in this sense, then, we can rightly say that in more ways than one Lee Harvey Oswald did indeed have an \"ADL connection\" and thus, an \"Israeli connection.\" The big question, then, is just what did the ADL know about Lee Harvey Oswald and when did they know it? Ho w much information gathered by Oswald did the ADL get from Guy Banister? How much information gathered by Oswald did they get from Hosty? Was Banister indeed using Oswald as part of an ADL \"fact - finding\" operation? Or — dare we say it — was Oswald really only on the ADL's payroll all along? Was, in fact, the ADL financing Oswald's activities on behalf of Banister and/or Hosty? Does this explain why no records exist which \"prove\" that Oswald was on the FBI's payroll? Again — just some questions. JACK RUBY AND THE ADL - FBI CONNECTION It should be noted, additionally, that while many JFK assassination researchers look in the direction of \"right wing hate groups\" as a possible source of the JFK conspiracy, these same researchers fail to remember that these same group s were heavily infiltrated by the FBI's COINTELPRO operation. For example, William Sullivan, the FBI official who headed COINTELPRO once estimated that for every 25 Ku Klux Klan members there were 3 COINTELPRO operatives among them. Thus, taking Sullivan's figures at face value, let's consider the case of Jack Ruby, the Dallas nightclub keeper who killed Lee Harvey Oswald. JFK researchers say Ruby knew about half of the 1200 members of the Dallas Police Department and often entertained groups of more than 3 0 at a time at his club. The researchers claim 50% of the Dallas cops were either members of the KKK or the Minutemen or other extreme right wing groups. Based on the figures put forth by both Sullivan and the researchers, it is not an extraordinary assert ion, then, that many of Ruby's \"extreme right\" contacts in the Dallas Police Department were, in fact, COINTELPRO operatives. And if they were COINTELPRO operatives, then, they certainly had close connections to the ADL. But to return to the subject of Guy Banister's infamous \"right wing extremist associates\" — Kent and Phoebe Courtney — we can conclude, based on Banister's close association with \"Bee\" Botnick of the New Orleans office of the ADL, that it is not out of the realm of possibility that Banister's g ood friends, Kent and Phoebe Courtney, were likewise receiving covert support — maybe financing — from the ADL."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"424 “ Commun ist Blood Red” [327] In fact, by their actions, the Courtneys were suppressing \"anti - Semitic\" tendencies within the American \"right\" which is precisely what the ADL ha d sought to do since its inception. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the Courtneys were functioning as ADL assets. And it is highly unlikely that they would have associated so closely with Guy Banister if they would have perceived him to be among the \"h aters\" that they so loudly opposed. The Courtneys were fervent boosters of Guy Banister's former boss at the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover — and they certainly noted Hoover's claim in his 1958 anti - communist magnum opus, Masters of Deceit , that \"some of the most effe ctive opposition to communism in the United States has come from Jewish organizations such as . . . the Anti - Defamation League, and a host of other Jewish groups.\" 826 Therefore, the ADL would have been very much in the good graces of Kent and Phoebe Courtn ey, by any respects. (In Chapter 7 we discussed Hoover's own ADL connections in some detail.) THE COURTNEYS AND ISRAEL However, there is something else that must be noted — and it is significant indeed: Kent and Phoebe Courtney, in fact, were devoted suppo rters of Israel. Their perception of the Middle East state was remarkably similar to that of the CIA's James Angleton and others of that mode who proclaimed Israel as some sort of bulwark against Soviet aggression — a theory that lost much of its luster afte r the fall of the Soviet Union as a Cold War target for American anti - communists. In any case, Kent Courtney outlined this theory in an editorial in yet another of his publications, The Patriot Tribune , which he published out of Pineville, Louisiana. In a May 28, 1970 editorial entitled \"Israel Can Stop Russian Expansion\" Courtney laid to rest any doubts about his support for the Zionist cause. He wrote, in part: \"Israel — the historic, ideological homeland of the Jews — is also the shrine of all Christians. To day, Israel is surrounded by enemies who were administered a stunning defeat in June 1967. Israel stands at the traditional crossroads of history and if Israel is allowed to fall, everything relative to Christian history in Israel will be destroyed by the revengeful Arabs, and the atheistic, nihilistic communists will be satanically delighted, in the destruction of all the symbols and shrines of Christianity . . . \"Israel today stands surrounded by enemies with her back to the sea and the Arabs have promise d each other and the world that they will push all the Jews into the Sea in a war of annihilation. And the Communist Russians, who themselves continuously persecute the Jews inside the Soviet Union are now supplying the anti - aircraft guns, fighter planes, bombers, tanks, artillery, the pilots, and the technicians which the otherwise untrained, undisciplined Arabs cannot effectively use.\" 827 The goal of the Soviet Union, Courtney said, was world conquest without engaging their own troops in direct confrontat ion with the United States. According to Courtney, then - President Richard Nixon could:"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"[328] Final Judgment 425 \"Preserve Western Civilization by supplying the weapons of defense, indeed, the weapons of salvation to the indomitable, courageous, and highly skilled defense forces of Israel . . . \"If Mr. Nixon is interested in establishing peace in our time he will provide arms, ammunition, and moral strength to every anti - communist country which is willing to fight against Russian Communist imperialist aggression. And the place for President Nixon to start is Israel.\" 828 These then were the words of Kent Courtney, the \"right wing extremist\" that some JFK assassination researchers point to as evidence of Guy Banister's \"right wing extremist\" connections. However, quite clearly, we ca n also contend, based upon Courtney's ideological affinity for Israel, that the evidence is just as logical that Courtney (and his friend Banister) were sympathetic to the Zionist cause. This is not to suggest that Banister was cognizant of a Mossad connec tion ultimately behind the JFK assassination conspiracy. Far from it. (Although he could have been.) What it does suggest, however, is that Banister was very clearly moving in circles that were sympathetic to the interests of Israel. And in light of the st andard picture that JFK researchers have presented about Banister (and the Courtneys) the material that we've just analyzed does indeed present a far different picture than we've ever seen before in any studies of the JFK assassination conspiracy. The Cour tney theory regarding Israel (mirroring that of James Angleton at the CIA) was adopted by many of those on the \"right wing\" in America and it was — as we saw in our appendix on George Bush and his pro - Israel allies on the CIA's \"B - Team\" — the guiding theory be hind much of the United States arms buildup during the Reagan era of the 1980s. It is really neither here nor there as to whether or not the Courtneys were actually paid ADL informants or assets, for there is no question (as we have seen) that they shared the ADL's world view. It is likewise of no relevance whether Mrs. Courtney (as alleged) was related in some way to the Stern family of New Orleans. The fact is that they were moving in the same circles — more so than many people realize. In fact, in the end, there is really some question as to whether Edgar and Edith Stern of New Orleans were really so \"liberal\" after all. As we saw in Chapter 15 and in Chapter 17, it was the Stern's media voice in New Orleans, the WDSU radio and television empire, that playe d a critical part in promoting the theory during the summer of 1963 (and then, later, after the assassination) that Lee Harvey Oswald was a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" What's more, it now turns out, the Sterns were members — and major financial supporters — of the New Orleans - based Information Council of the Americas, run by noted anti - communist, Dr. Alton Ochsner, Sr. who himself had long - standing and intimate ties to the intelligence community. 829 Ochsner himself served on the board of directors of the Foreign Pol icy Association of New Orleans with the Stern's close friend, Clay Shaw, 830 who also served on the board of the Mossad's Permindex operation which was so central to the JFK assassination conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"426 “ Communist Blood Red” [329] So, although it is unlikely that Edith Stern would have — like Phoebe Courtney — ordered her steaks \"Communist Blood Red,\" it does seem that Edith and Phoebe had a few interests in common, one of them being strong support for the Zionist cause. And this most definitely sheds new light on the Courtney connection, a lthough it is not something that fits in with the standard perception of Kent and Phoebe Courtney. GARRISON AND THE 'RIGHT WING' And what is particularly interesting to note is something that \"liberal\" researchers into the JFK assassination have a diffic ult time explaining when they try to suggest that \"right wing extremists\" were behind the JFK assassination: in fact, it was none other than The Councilor, a frankly anti - Semitic and anti - Zionist journal published by the aforementioned Ned Touchstone, that actually pioneered much of the early work pinpointing the links between David Ferrie and Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the JFK assassination, 831 providing much support for Jim Garrison's inquiry that led to the indictment of the Stern family friend, Mossad - c onnected Clay Shaw. Although many accounts of the Garrison investigation suggest that Garrison viewed the JFK conspiracy as some sort of \"right wing\" conspiracy, Garrison rejected that thesis when he told Paris Flammonde: \"It isn't really right - wing . . . it's almost a centrist sort of thing. It is a power which has developed within the government.\" 832 Garrison pointed out that \"One of the things that really helped me see that was when I began to notice that we were getting help from individuals who were Mi nutemen and members of the John Birch Society. When I saw that, I realized that the right - wing (aspects of the conspiracy) was right wing more in appearance than in reality. So, we just kept on digging and we end up with nothing but a compartment of the Ce ntral Intelligence Agency.\" 833 Garrison added that the CIA had actually penetrated numerous groups and used them for its own nefarious purposes in the assassination c o n s p i r a c y , 834 a l t h o u g h G a r r i s o n , i t m i g h t b e n o t e d , c o u l d j u s t a s e a s i l y have commented t hat Israel's Mossad — through the ADL — had done likewise. Had Garrison then been cognizant of many of the then - hidden factors documented in Final Judgment, he may well indeed have uncovered the Mossad connections that we have uncovered here and which (evident ly) Garrison later did discover on his own. ATTACKING FINAL JUDGMENT What is interesting (but not surprising, as we shall see) is that the very individuals — Ellen Ray and Bill Schaap — whose Sheridan Square Press published Garrison's memoir, On the Trail of the Assassins, are among those who have been attempting to discredit Final Judgment despite the fact that Final Judgment concurs with Garrison's basic conclusions. The fall 1994 issue of Covert Action Quarterly (a journal edited by Ray and Schaap) feature d a lengthy full - force attack on The Spotlight, the"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"[330] Final Judgment 427 national weekly newspaper by which I was employed for some twenty one years. What was particularly interesting about the article was that CAQ's opening thrust speared The Spotlight for publicizing the r elease of Final Judgment with much fanfare in January of 1994 — resulting, it might be added, in the sale of nearly 8,000 copies within two weeks time. Although CAQ features much useful material and portrays itself as an \"independent\" voice critical of the C IA and its misdeeds (and is, in fact, cited in the pages of Final Judgment), CAQ is careful never to mention (other than in passing) the CIA's incestuous relationship with the Mossad, even when the Mossad has been engaged intimately alongside the CIA in ma ny of the matters that CAQ presumes to be dissecting for its readers. Despite the fact that CAQ mentioned that the nation's best known JFK assassination investigator, Mark Lane — certainly no \"right wing extremist\" by anyone's definition — has represented The Spotlight, CAQ never once mentioned Lane's stunning dismemberment of CIA operative E. Howard Hunt in Hunt's libel case against The Spotlight (analyzed in Chapter 9 and in Chapter 16 of Final Judgment.) In fact, the results of Lane's work in that case have never once been mentioned in CAQ at all. This is unusual, to say the least, in light of CAQ's professed role as a CIA watchdog. What then explains CAQ's bias against The Spotlight — and against Final Judgment in particular? Perhaps it has something to do wit h the fact that the Institute for Media Analysis (a \"media watchdog\" organization also sponsored by Ellen Ray and Bill Schaap) has received substantial funding from an influential foundation known as the Stern Family Fund — funded by that same Stern family a bout whom we have heard so much in this book. 835 It has been suggested that Ray and Schaap, the publishers of CAQ, felt obligated to publish the attack on The Spotlight because many of their Jewish readers were upset by an earlier CAQ report on the ADL spy scandal in San Francisco in 1993. 8 36 By taking aim at The Spotlight, CAQ was able to assure readers it was not adopting a stance toward the ADL similar to that of The Spotlight which pioneered coverage of the ADL's spy operations. In fact, CAQ could not very well have ignored the ADL spy scandal affair, inasmuch as even \"mainstream\" media outlets (including Editor & Publisher magazine) actually carried reports on the scandal. What's more, because many self - styled \"progressive\" groups and individuals had d iscovered that because they were targets of the ADL's spy operations, CAQ — by virtue of its claim to be a voice for those same progressives — was obligated to comment on the affair. However, as noted previously, CAQ is otherwise reticent about daring to criti cize the Mossad. Thus, CAQ's effort to discredit The Spotlight and its publicizing of Final Judgment is no real surprise, especially in light of the financial backing that CAQ's publishers have received from the Stern family so central to the New Orleans i ntrigue documented in this book. Not only it seems did the Sterns have their fingers in the \"right wing\" pie in New Orleans, through their association with INCA, but they've also"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"428 “Communist Blood Red” [331] got their hands in the \"left wing\" pie through their funding of the CAQ - ass ociated Institute for Media Analysis. That we find the Sterns so intimately connected in so many ways to the circumstances surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy is interesting indeed. (A FINAL NOTE REGARDING CAQ: Since this was originally writte n, CAQ has come under new direction and has been more forthright in its criticisms of Israel and the intrigues of the Mossad. So we must give credit where credit is due.) ANOTHER 'ISRAEL' CONNECTION? Although the details of Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in New Orleans, moving in the Banister - Courtney - Shaw - Stern sphere of influence, has been heavily documented, there are a few mysteries that remain. For example, when Oswald applied for a room in New Orleans he told what CIA - connected writer Priscilla McMilla n describes somewhat gratuitously in her book on Oswald as \"another of his funny, pointless lies.\" 83 7 According to McMillan, Oswald said that he \"worked for the Leon Israel Company of 300 Magazine Street.\" 838 According to McMillan, \"the company existed, b ut it was not the company that had hired him.\" 839 What we do know is that the Leon Israel Company was engaged in the import of coffee. What we don't know is why Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he worked there. Another thing we also do not know is why JFK as sassination researchers have not devoted more time and energy to exploring the history and background of this company. Although researchers have gone to great lengths to study virtually every other picayune detail about the events surrounding Oswald's stay in New Orleans, there is very little, if anything, said about this Leon Israel Company. Evidence suggests that the principal figure behind the Leon Israel Company, Samuel Israel Jr., was indeed connected to Clay Shaw and the International Trade Mart durin g the period surrounding the JFK assassination — and perhaps for even much longer. According to Who's Who in America (1964 - 65 edition), Israel was more than just a coffee importer. Not only did Israel serve as vice president of the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans and on the Council of the Lower Mississippi River Port Interests (which would certainly put him in trade executive Clay Shaw's immediate sphere of association), but Israel also — intriguingly — won the French Medal of Merit for his serv ice in the U.S. Army transportation corps in Europe. 840 This would have been at the time that Shaw himself was stationed in France, winning decorations from the French for his own service there. A good argument can thus be made that Shaw and Israel did ind eed know each other and that their relationship may have gone as far back as World War II. Is it possible Oswald was promised a job at the Leon Israel Company — arranged by Clay Shaw himself — or, that, contrary to McMillan, Oswald, in fact, was employed (in s ome fashion) by the Leon Israel Company? If so, precisely how was he employed? Did this company"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"[332] Final Judgment 429 play some still un - detected role in manipulating Oswald's activities in New Orleans? These are just a few interesting questions that need to be answered. THE BARRY SEAL CO NNECTION There is yet one last matter relating to the New Orleans connection that bears mentioning. In the spring of 2000, independent film producer Dan Hopsicker released a remarkable video, In Search of the American Drug Lords: Barry and t he Boys — From Dallas to Mena, 841 focusing on Hopsicker's three - year long investigation of CIA pilot and drug smuggler Barry Seal, best known for his role in the CIA's arms - drugs - and - money laundering operations out of the tiny Mena, Arkansas airport during t he 1980s as part of the infamous Iran - contra operations that (largely unknown to the American public) very much involved Israel and the Mossad. 84 2 In his film, Hopsicker demonstrates not only that Lee Harvey Oswald did have long - standing connections to Da vid Ferrie (efforts to refute that fact notwithstanding) but also that it was Ferrie who recruited Seal into the CIA's intrigue, Ferrie having had high - level intelligence connections going back as far as his service as a pilot during World War II. What's m ore, Hopsicker has uncovered new information which suggests that Seal may have been a get - away pilot for one or more of the JFK assassins. Thus perhaps Ferrie himself was not a get - away pilot per se (as long surmised) but instead he was actually coordinati ng Seal's role in that regard, a role which would explain Ferries famous mad dash across Louisiana into Texas immediately after the assassination. And although Hopsicker does not delve into the Mossad connection, the fact is the CIA and the Mossad have wor ked closely in the global drug trade, using its resources to finance their joint international operations. It is thus conceivable that this would provide us yet another as - yet - undetermined Mossad connection as far as the activities of David Ferrie are conc erned. THE BIG PICTURE OF 'THE BIG EASY' These are the types of details — taken together — that paint a picture fully in line with the thesis of Final Judgment and which demonstrate that the New Orleans connection is critical to understanding the forces behi nd the intrigue surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the murder of President Kennedy. Contrary to what some researchers might contend, the evidence does not point to a \"right wing\" conspiracy at all, but instead one with multiple ties to both the CIA and Israel's Mossad."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Appendix Four Ag ent s of Inf luence A Troubleso me Topic: The Jewish P resence o n t he Wa rren Co mmissio n \"The Best and the Brightest\" — and Jerry Ford, Too.

If the Warren Commission had been sincere in investigating the JFK conspiracy — and discovered an Israeli c o n n e c t i o n — t h e i m me n s e \" J e w i s h p r e s e n c e \" w i t h i n t h e c o m m i s s i o n c o u l d h a v e p r o v i d e d t h e m e a n s w h e r e b y t h e Israeli connection would undoubtedly have been covered up. Although the Warren Commission has been damned to the ends of the earth for nearly forty years, few actually know who really pulled the strings behind the scenes as this now - infamous deliberating body carried out its purported investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy — or the real origins of how the commission actually came about. On November 22, 1964 The Washingto n Post published a glowing endorsement of The Warren Commission Report by Eugene Rostow, then dean of the Yale Law School. But what neither the Post nor Rostow mentioned in this fraud upon the readers was that it was Rostow himself who was the first person to suggest to President Johnson that such a commission as the Warren Commission be established! Rostow and the Post were able to get away with this deception because the truth is that Rostow's pivotal role in the creation of the commission was not publicl y detailed in any consequence until thirty years after the JFK assassination. For those thirty years, the \"idea\" for the commission had been attributed to others. However, in 1993, transcriptions of recorded telephone conversations in the Johnson White Hou se were released for the first time. According to JFK researcher Donald Gibson, the transcripts reveal that \"the idea of a presidential commission to report on the assassination of President Kennedy was first suggested by Eugene Rostow in a telephone call to LBJ aide Bill Moyers during the afternoon of November 24th,\" 843 within minutes of Lee Harvey Oswald's murder by Jack Ruby. While many JFK researchers point to Rostow's ties to \"the foreign policy establishment\" what they don't mention is the particular foreign policy that has been of special interest to Rostow throughout his career."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"[334] Final Judgment 431 In fact, Rostow's primary foreign policy concern has been the interests of Israel, so much so that Rostow has even been a board member of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, which has been described as being \"run by individuals closely identified with Israeli interests and may be regarded as a virtual lobbying organization for the state of Israel . . . .\" 844 Thus, the truth is that, from its inception, the W arren Commission's origins were linked to pressure from an influential figure within the Israeli lobby's power elite — a very interesting little detail indeed. And because we now know there were \"top secret\" U.S. intelligence documents circulated after the a ssassination indicating the Arab press was alleging \"the Zionists\" were behind the president's murder, 845 — citing, as an indication, for example, the fact Jack Ruby was Jewish — we can rightly speculate that these were among the kind of \"ugly rumors\" in the foreign press the Warren Commission was established to suppress. What few JFK assassination researchers have ever bothered to investigate — or at least discuss publicly — however, are the antecedents of the 22 lawyers who were actually in charge of the day - to - day investigation and in preparing the final report and who — from behind the scenes — filtered the data to the big names who signed their names to the report. The facts demonstrate that there was a substantial \"Jewish presence\" at this staff level that could have impacted substantially on the handling of any evidence of Mossad involvement or Mossad connections of persons who came under scrutiny in the course of the investigation, assuming the claim by the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith — that Amer ican Jews are \"sensitive\" to the concerns of the state of Israel — is true. For the record, this author does not buy the theory that all Jewish Americans are necessarily partisans of Israel or obligated to be. In fact — to reiterate what has already been said here — some of the most forthright critics of Israel and its misdeeds have been Americans of Jewish descent. However, inasmuch as the ADL, which has relentlessly attacked Final Judgment, purports to speak for the concerns of the Jewish community and says tha t the thesis of this book is \"offensive\" to the Jewish community, we will therefore accept the ADL's contention that Jewish Americans are sensitive to Israel's concerns. Therefore, it is not a leap of logic to contend that in the event evidence linking Isr ael's Mossad to the JFK assassination had come forth that Jewish Americans on the commission staff would be constitutionally inclined to cover up any evidence that did emerge.

For this we begin with the November 28, 1988 edition of the National Law Journal featured a cover story by David A. Kaplan entitled \"The JFK Probe - 2 5 Years Later.\" The story included capsule biographies of the lawyers of the Warren Commission, describing the 22 lawyers of the commission staff as \"the best and the brightest of their generation.\" 846"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"432 Agents of Influence [335] Who were they? What were their political connection s? How did they come on board the commission staff? Kaplan answers some of these questions — but not all of them. What follows is a summary of Kaplan's details, and additional information readily available in the public domain. We can only wonder what other details remain to be told. THE JEWISH LAWYERS First of all, a brief look at the basic statistics: of the fourteen assistant counsel, five were Jewish. Another was married to a Jewish woman. Of the seven \"other staff members\" (lawyers and law clerks) name d in Kaplan's article, four were Jewish. This means that of the 22 lawyers in question, nearly half of them (including the staffer whose wife was Jewish) could be described as constituting a \"Jewish presence\" on the commission. However, as we shall see, th e political connections of other staff lawyers suggests that the \"Jewish presence\" was even more substantial. Here then are the Jewish staff lawyers who served on the Warren Commission: Norman Redlich. A deputy to the commission's chief counsel, J. Lee Ra nkin, Redlich was the actual author of the final disreputable document known as the Warren Commission Report. He was involved at a high - level in Jewish community affairs prior to service on the Warren Commission, having been recruited as a member of the Am erican Jewish Congress committee on law and social action in 1962; later he served as a member of the board of overseers of the Jewish Theological Seminary. From 1966 to 1974 he was in the office of New York City's corporation counsel. In 1974 Redlich succ eeded his sponsor, Corporation Counsel J. Lee Rankin (earlier the chief counsel to the Warren Commission, more about whom below). M elv in Aro n Eisenberg. Bo th b efo r e and after the W arr en Commission inquiry, Eisenberg was an associate in the New York law fi rm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler which has an intimate history of associations with Jewish concerns and can generally be described as a \"Jewish\" law firm. This firm once represented shadowy conservative operative John Rees, who is known for his ties to Israeli intelligence. On the Warren Commission, Eisenberg served as the assistant to Norman Redlich and was also responsible for analysis of scientific evidence on ballistics. Modern - day JFK assassination buffs who spend endless hours re - examining such topics as \"where the shots came from\" can thank Eisenberg for his contributions to their debate, although Eisenberg has been eclipsed in infamy by his Warren Commission colleague, Arlen Specter. Arlen Specter. Specter was a Democratic assistant dist rict attorney during the five years prior to his rise to national fame as the inventive creator (along with Redlich) of the discredited and outlandish \"single bullet theory\" which contends that one bullet — purportedly fired by Lee Harvey"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"[336] Final Judgment 433 Oswald — managed to do some particularly remarkable ballistic gyrations while passing through both John F. Kennedy and Governor John Connally of Texas and then emerged pristine. Today Specter is not only a steadfast enthusiast of the Warren Commission Report but is also one of the Israeli lobby's chief legislative tacticians in Congress. Specter frequently travels at U.S. taxpayer expense on \"official business\" to Israel where his American - born sister has taken up residence. (An interesting note: Prior to recognizing the full import of Specter's outrageous behavior on the Warren Commission, this author — as a college student — made a small contribution to Specter's successful 1980 Senate campaign in Pennsylvania and later — much to my surprise — was invited [without having first asked ] to submit my resume for possible employment on Specter's staff in Washington — an offer I rejected, and wisely so.) David W. Belin. Until his recent demise, Belin remained perhaps the most vocal former staff member defending the Warren Commission. Describ ed as a \"respected Midwestern Republican lawyer who would add geographical diversity to the staff,\" 847 A partner in a prestigious Des Moines firm before he came to the commission, Belin popped up in 1975 as staff director of the so - called \"Rockefeller Comm ission\" instituted by Belin's former Warren Commission associate, President Gerald Ford. Ostensibly charged with investigating CIA misdeeds, Belin proved himself a valuable defender of CIA interests. In the 1975 inquiry one of Belin's major concerns, accor ding to JFK researcher James DiEugenio, was trying to refute the idea that the CIA's E. Howard Hunt was connected to the events in Dallas. 848 By so doing, Belin was effectively suppressing Hunt's involvement in Dallas with Frank Sturgis, a known CIA and Mo ssad asset who claimed to have actually played a part in the assassination. Samuel A. Stern. As a former law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1955 - 1956, Stern was thus well - placed to influence the chief of the commission on an intimate level. An a ttorney with the high - powered Washington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering and later with the firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin, Stern had \"extensive international practice, particularly in financing ventures in emerging countries.\" 849 As a consequen ce Stern has almost necessarily had connections with the intelligence community as part of his global ventures. (The Mossad, just for the record, is also active in \"emerging countries.\") Murray J. Laulicht. A lower - level staff member, this young attorney came to the Warren Commission only hours after graduating first in his class from Columbia University law school. He was recommended by a childhood friend, attorney Nathan Lewin, who was then a special assistant in the U.S. solicitor general's office. The two had \"gone to camp together.\" 850 In later years, Laulicht's sponsor, Lewin, emerged as a Washington attorney known for his close association with the Israeli lobby."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"434 Agents of Influence [337] Richard M. Mosk. Another staffer, Mosk was the son of California State Supreme Court J ustice Stanley Mosk, one of the most prominent members of the powerful Los Angeles Jewish community. Later a member of two \"Jewish\" law firms, Mosk served from 1981 to 1984 as a member of the Iran - United States Claims Tribunal in the Hague adjudicating cla ims against Israel's fiercest fundamentalist Islamic critic after the fall of the Shah of Iran whom we saw in Chapter 18 was a close ally of both the Mossad and the CIA which jointly created the Shah's dreaded SAVAK. Stuart R. Pollak. Another former law c lerk for Chief Justice Warren, Pollak later served in the Justice Department and as an attorney in private practice in San Francisco which is reported by famed Jewish corruption fighter Sherman Skolnick to be a key American \"station\" for Israel's Mossad. I n 1993 the Mossad's intelligence and propaganda unit — the ADL — was revealed to be running its number one undercover informant, Roy Edward Bullock out of San Francisco. (It was this author who first exposed Bullock — in 1986 — as an ADL asset, much to the ADL's d ismay.) Lloyd L. Weinreb. Having clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice John M. Harlan from 1963 - 1964, prior to joining the Warren Commission staff, Weinreb assisted Norman Redlich in the editing and final preparation of the commission's report. After a b rief stint in the criminal division of the Justice Department, Weinreb went on to serve as a Harvard law professor. THE OTHERS The other Warren Commission lawyers who were not Jewish did still, in many cases nonetheless, have very distinct connections to political interests and individuals who were, in turn, attune to the interests of the powerful Israeli lobby. Let us examine the others. J. Lee Rankin. The chief counsel to the Warren Commission, Rankin knew Warren from the time that Rankin served as U.S . solicitor general under President Eisenhower. A former attorney in Lincoln, Nebraska Rankin later established himself as a Manhattan attorney and then served as New York City's corporation counsel from 1965 to 1972 — a key position in the American city whe re Jewish power and influence is supreme. (It was Rankin who brought his junior Warren Commission colleague — the aforementioned Redlich to the corporation counsel's office, easing Redlich's succession to the post when Rankin retired.) Howard P. Willens. A Justice Department \"whiz kid\" described as being — along with Norman Redlich — \"a staffer essentially without portfolio,\" 8 5 1 Willens \"assisted\" the Chief Justice in staffing the commission and served as the \"key administrative aide in the investigation.\" 852 A lthough not Jewish himself, his wife was Jewish and"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"[338] Final Judgment 435 Willens, therefore, can be counted as one of those on the commission sensitive to Jewish concerns. Joseph A. Ball. Said by the National Law Journal to be \"one of the leading American trial lawyers of h is generation,\" 853 Ball was an old friend of the chief justice, having known Warren from \"California political circles.\" Ball, in short, was a political crony of the chief justice and certainly not one to rock the boat. Ball was purported to be the commiss ion's \"expert\" on Lee Harvey Oswald and by virtue of that status can rightly be called one of the great myth makers of all time. Albert E. Jenner, J r. A maj o r p layer in the Chicago legal community, personally recruited to the commission by Earl Warren, Je nner was a senior member of a commission group that prepared the commission's fraudulent profile of Lee Harvey Oswald as \"one lone nut\" who had no CIA or other intelligence connections. Jenner had an interesting connection of his own. At the time Jenner wa s named to the commission he served as the personal attorney to Chicago construction and real estate tycoon Henry Crown. 854 A Jewish billionaire, Crown was a major contributor to Jewish causes, including the Wiezmann Institute in Israel, 8 55 a major force in Israel's nuclear weapons programs (that JFK so strenuously opposed). Although highly \"reputable\" in his later years, Crown established much of his clout in Chicago through his ties to organized crime. 8 56 Crown plowed much of his wealth into defense con tracting and was a major stockholder in the General Dynamics Corporation (which Jenner also represented) which was under investigation by the Kennedy Justice Department prior to the JFK assassination. 8 5 7 And as we noted in Chapter 15, the Bronfman family — s ponsors of Louis Bloomfield of the Mossad's Permindex operation — were also major shareholders in General Dynamics. Jenner later served as the chief minority counsel to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate scandal and was assuredly tuned i n fully to the CIA intrigue related to the affair (which we will review in Appendix Seven). In any case, it's clear that Jenner, too, can be deemed — through his association with Crown — as part of the \"Jewish presence\" on the Warren Commission. Wesley J. Lie beler. A former New York attorney, Liebeler worked closely with Albert Jenner in covering up Lee Harvey Oswald's intelligence community antecedents, although in future years he emerged as an expert in the less fascinating field of anti - trust law (suggestin g that analysis of intelligence intrigue was never his field of expertise to begin with). Leon D. Hubert, Jr. A former New Orleans District Attorney who could have uncovered details about Lee Harvey Oswald's sojourn in New Orleans, Hubert was instead assi gned to investigate the activities of Jack Ruby in Dallas. Although recommended for the commission by one of its members, Rep. Hale Boggs, Hubert — like Boggs — was doubtful about"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"436 Agents of Influence [339] many commission conclusions. Interestingly, Boggs, who died in a plane crash i n 1972 , was once described as an \"errand boy\" 858 for Mossad - connected Clay Shaw's close friend, Edith Stern, head of the WDSU media empire in New Orleans that helped create Lee Harvey Oswald's public image as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" Thus, Boggs and Hubert were positioned to restrict inquiries into the Shaw - Banister - Ferrie apparatus in New Orleans that was intertwined with the Lake Ponchartrain Cuban - exile training operations of CIA contract agent and Mossad asset Frank Sturgis. Burt W. Griffin. A junior m ember of Leon Hubert's commission team investigating Jack Ruby's background, Griffin was a former assistant U.S. attorney and practicing lawyer in Cleveland. Later a Cleveland trial judge, Griffin — like Hubert — ultimately expressed some doubts about the comm ission's findings but was never vocal about his reservations. William T. Coleman, Jr. At the time of his appointment to the commission, Coleman was one of the most prominent Black attorneys in the nation, associated with the \"political\" law firm of Dilwor th, Paxon, Kalish, Levy & Coleman, headed by Philadelphia's former Democratic Mayor Richardson Dilworth. Coleman's edge up the political/legal ladder came, however, when he clerked in 1948 - 49 for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, one of the most ard ent leaders of the Jewish community in America. Coleman's clerkship came at the very time that the state of Israel was being established. On the Warren Commission Coleman was the senior member of a team examining \"possible foreign conspiracies\" 859 behind the assassination of President Kennedy. He found no such conspiracies. W. David Slawson. A Princeton graduate with a master's degree in theoretical physics, Slawson essentially functioned as an assistant to William Coleman — eleven years his senior — in \"rese arching conspiracy theories.\" 860 This was, needless to say, a highly unlikely post, to say the least, for a young man with a background in physics and who was charged with the responsibility of investigating foreign conspiracies which may have been behind the assassination. Slawson gave up his study of international intrigue after he left the Warren Commission and specialized in the far less theoretical and highly unscientific fields of contracts and antitrust as a law professor at the University of Souther n California Francis W. H. Adams. The former New York City police commissioner from 1954 to 1955 , Adams should presumably have been a top - notch investigator for the commission. It appears, however, that Adams was mere window dressing. Although Adams was s upposed to be teamed with Arlen Specter to track President Kennedy's activities in Dallas as well as investigate the motorcade, Adams was, according to the National Law Journal , \"rarely present,\" 861 so much so that Chief Justice Warren mistook him for a co roner testifying before the commission. Recommended to the"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"[340] Final Judgment 437 commission staff by New York Mayor Robert Wagner, long known for his close relationship with the New York Jewish community, one might suggest with good reason that Adams would be particularly attu ned to Jewish political concerns in light of his previous high profile appointment as New York police commissioner. Alfredda Scobey. Perhaps the least known of all of the commission staff was its only female staffer. The law clerk to a Georgia judge — the n ephew of Sen. Richard Russell (D - Ga.), a member of the Warren Commission — Ms. Scobey, then 51 and considerably older than virtually all of her colleagues, was appointed to the staff at Russell's recommendation. She served as his \"observer\" since the senator did not attend many commission meetings. In light of the fact that Russell was later known to be one of the Warren Commission \"dissenters,\" Ms. Scobey must have been quite alert in her observations. Among all of the commission staffers — and perhaps precise ly because of her alertness — Ms. Scobey never rose to any type of prominence, returning to work as a law clerk until her retirement. Charles N. Shaffer, Jr. Also practically forgotten as a member of the Warren Commission staff, Shaffer was an aide to the U .S. attorney general both before and after the Warren Commission. Shaffer's claim to fame is that his most famous client was Watergate figure John Dean who helped bring down the Nixon administration. Ultimately, as we shall see in Appendix Seven, there was much more to the Watergate scandal than meets the eye and it does indeed tie back to the Kennedy assassination — but not in the way that so many JFK researchers seem to believe. So perhaps Shaffer's reappearance in Watergate is really not a coincidence afte r all. John Hart Ely. Another of the little - known junior staffers — only 24 at the time — this Yale graduate was rewarded for his service on the Warren Commission with a clerkship under Chief Justice Warren after the commission closed up shop. Ely rose to bec ome dean of the prestigious Stanford Law School. Clearly, then, there was a definitive \"Jewish presence\" on the staff of the Warren Commission in virtually every key aspect of its inquiries. And even where a Warren staffer was not necessarily Jewish, many of those staffers had other connections which would make them \"sensitive\" to Jewish concerns. This is not a pleasant topic and one which certainly invites allegations of \"anti - Semitism,\" but it is a topic that deserves examination for the record, particul arly in light of what is suggested in Final Judgment . GERALD FORD'S MOSSAD - LANSKY CONNECTION However, the \"Jewish presence\" on the Warren Commission has another interesting facet — and one that has never been explored elsewhere to the knowledge of this aut hor."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"438 Agents of Influence [341] Although JFK assassination researchers have exercised themselves relentlessly over the fact that Warren Commission member (and later U.S. President) Gerald Ford, then a Republican congressman from Michigan, was J. Edgar Hoover's eager and willing in formant, supplying confidential commission findings to the FBI throughout the commission's tenure, an equally strong argument can be made that Ford was also at least a potential conduit for both the Lansky syndicate and the Mossad. This startling allegatio n, on its face, might appear a bit extraordinary to some, but let's look at the facts. At the time that Ford was appointed to the commission, one of his closest political allies and major financial backers was a Detroit - based figure named Max Fisher. Just after Ford assumed the presidency in 1974 — in the wake of the Watergate scandal — Fisher was described as one of \"the mystery men behind Gerald Ford\" who would \"tell the president what to do and when to do it.\" 862 And in light of his status in Ford's rising p olitical fortunes, we do know that in 1963 — when Ford was appointed to the Warren Commission, Fisher likewise was then in a position to tell Ford \"what to do and when to do it.\" So who is Max Fisher? Here's how Gerald Ford described Fisher in his own memoir s. Fisher, he said, was \"a prominent Detroit businessman who was chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel. Max was a lifelong Republican and a close friend. He had served as an unofficial ambassador between the United states and Israel for years, and his c ontacts at the highest levels of both governments had often helped us bridge over misunderstandings.” 863 Edward Tivnan's portrayal of Fisher in The Lobby: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy is even more detailed and points toward Fisher's high - level role in the Jewish lobby in America. Tivnan describes Fisher as, among other things: \"a former head of the Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds, chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, member of the Executive Committee of the American Jewish Committee, a major donor to the Republican Party.\" 864 In regard to Fisher's status both here in the United States and in Israel, Jean Baer writes admiringly in her book, The Self Chosen, that Fisher \"has served as an unofficial financial advisor to the Israeli government and has been called 'probably the most prominent Republican in the country.'\" 865 Although there are many GOP socialites who would dispute Baer's fawning (and somewhat inaccurate) suggestion that Fisher was \"the most prominent Repub lican in the country,\" Israeli correspondent Wolf Blitzer was probably more in perspective when he declared in 1985 that Fisher had \"long been the most influential Jew in the Republican Party \" 866 — certainly a unique status, by anyone's judgment — and among t hose who, according to Blitzer, \"sensitized the Republican national leadership to the concerns of the American Jewish community.\" 867 J. J. Goldberg, writing in Jewish Power: Inside the American Jewish Establishment, describes Ford's chief financial angel as one of \"the two most senior leaders of the organized Jewish community . . . [and] one of the"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"[342] Final Judgment 439 wealthiest men in America ... [who] always insisted that he did not speak for himself but for the American Jewish community and its elected leadership.\" 868 So clearly, as we can see, Fisher was indeed someone to be reckoned with, to say the least. More interestingly, in the context of JFK's struggles with Israel that we have examined in Final Judgment , Goldberg quotes Fisher as saying that although Jewish voter s were more politically inclined toward the Democratic Party, \"Kennedy wouldn't ship any arms\" 869 to Israel (although Fisher added, quite incorrectly, that Lyndon Johnson didn't either) — thus suggesting that this powerful figure in the American Jewish commu nity was less than pleased with JFK's attitude toward Fisher's favorite foreign nation. FISHER, ROSENBAUM AND THE MOB But Fisher's less public political and financial antecedents — prior to his rise to prominence — are far more interesting, particularly in l ight of his access to the Warren Commission through Gerald Ford. At the time of the JFK assassination, Fisher was actually a business partner of longtime Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum, the driving force behind the shadowy Permindex corporation (discussed i n depth in Chapter 15) which played a central role in the assassination conspiracy. In 1957, in partnership with Tibor Rosenbaum's Swiss - Israel Trade B a n k , F i s h e r b o u g h t a c o n t r o l l i n g i n t e r e s t i n I s r a e l ' s P a z conglomerate — long owned by the Rothschild famil y of Europe — which maintained a monopoly over Israeli oil and petrochemical interests. 870 (As we noted in Chapter 7 — quite significantly enough — one of Rosenbaum's partners in the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank was Shaul Eisenberg, a longtime Mossad figure and one o f the prime movers behind Israel's nuclear bomb program. But, as we shall see in Appendix Nine there is much more to be discussed of Eisenberg later.) However, Fisher's Israeli connections went back much further and were far deeper. Fisher's mentor — in term s of his role in promoting Israel's interests — was no less than General Julius Klein, the former American army officer who played a major role in helping set up Israeli's Mossad and who later served as president of the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank. Klein himself described Fisher as \"my protégé [whom] I have always kept . . . well informed on all intelligence matters.\" 871 In the late 1940's and early 1950's Fisher traveled to Israel with Klein and was involved in training the Israeli armed forces and intelligence services as part of the activities of the Sonneborn Institute with which none other than Major Louis Bloomfield was associated. Later, of course, Bloomfield would serve as president and chairman of the board of Tibor Rosenbaum's Permindex operation. 872 I n Chapter 8 we discussed the Sonneborn Institute which was established to provide arms and money and other tactical assistance to the Jewish underground in Palestine, prior to the establishment of Israel in"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"440 Agents of Influence [343] 1948. As we noted, the Institute not only had w ide - ranging intelligence connections — but also intimate ties to the Lansky Syndicate. Therefore it will come as no surprise to the reader to learn that one of Fisher's contacts in both petroleum and weapons smuggling to the Jewish Haganah through Sonneborn was rising Lansky Syndicate figure Morris Dalitz, then of Detroit's Purple Gang, and one of the leading Mid - West dealers in military surplus. 873 Dalitz himself would later emerge as a prime investor in the Permindex operation and would become one of the hi ghest - ranking figures in the crime syndicate. (In Chapter 10 we first met Dalitz and examined the strange connection between Dalitz and House Assassinations Committee director Robert Blakey. In Chapter 14 we explored further the manner in which Blakey, whi le proclaiming that \"the Mafia Killed JFK,\" pointed the finger at Italian - American mob figures and away from the direction of the Jewish elements in the Lansky syndicate.) That Fisher and Dalitz should be working together at this time is interesting, inasm uch as during the early 1930's — nearly 20 years previously — Fisher had been a \"runner\" for Dalitz's Purple Gang in Detroit, carrying cash receipts to Bronfman family bootleggers in Canada in advance payment for forthcoming shipments of illicit goods. 874 Thus , the Fisher - Dalitz relationship had come full circle. The two successful businessmen who rose to affluence in the seamy world of the Lansky Crime Syndicate were now engaged in covert (and undoubtedly profitable) activities to advance the cause of Israel. Fisher's activities in the public arena on behalf of Israel brought him to public respectability. Until then he was simply known as a successful but still relatively small - time oilman. However, in 1957 when he was brought into Israel's Paz conglomerate as a partner with Tibor Rosenbaum and Shaul Eisenberg, Fisher's fortunes and political influence grew immensely. By 1964 — at which time Congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan was serving on the Warren Commission — Max Fisher was the undisputed financial angel for F ord and the Republican Party of Michigan. Fisher's fortunes continued to advance, however, as did his influence within the Republican Party nationwide and in international Jewish affairs. In 1975 the well - connected Mr. Fisher took over the chairmanship of United Brands, formerly United Fruit. 875 (The role of United Fruit in the 1954 coup in Guatemala — working in conjunction with the CIA — is discussed, among other places, by David Wise and Thomas B. Ross in their book, The Invisible Government — an early expose of the CIA — which refers to that misadventure in Central America as \"the CIA's banana revolt.\" 876 So it is to this day that Tibor Rosenbaum and Gerald Ford's mutual friend, Max Fisher, is one of the most powerful men in America — perhaps the world. But Ford a nd Rosenbaum themselves shared another interesting mutual friend. And, as we shall see, this mutual friend — like Max Fisher — played a pivotal role in advancing Gerald Ford's political career at a critical juncture in time."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"[344] Final Judgment 441 In their friendly biography of Me yer Lansky, authors Dennis Eisenberg, Uri Dan and Eli Landau feature an entire chapter devoted to Lansky's Mossad associate, Tibor Rosenbaum, and examine Rosenbaum's colorful and intriguing international connections. Of Rosenbaum, they point out: \"Another of his good friends in high places was Prince Bernhard, consort of the Queen of the Netherlands, who invited him to the royal palace in Holland to lecture leading Dutch bankers on good business practices. Here too a scandal ensued, when the Prince sold a c astle, the Warmelo, for $400,000 to a Liechtenstein firm, Evlyma, Inc., owned by Rosenbaum's [BCI]. Just why this castle was sold to the Swiss banker for what is described as a ridiculously low price has never been made clear.\" 877 (Needless to say, the or igins of this strange deal between Bernhard and Rosenbaum is grist for a conspiracy theorist's mill. Was it a pay - off from Bernhard to Rosenbaum for some other favor — such as Rosenbaum having orchestrated an assassination, using his Mossad connections, for Bernhard and his associates? (Or was it instead, maybe, some blackmail payment by Bernhard to Rosenbaum who, with his Mossad sources, might have come across some compromising information about the controversial prince who was known to be a wheeler and deal er of the worst order?) At any rate — at the same time that Bernhard was engaged in intrigue with Tibor Rosenbaum he was also bringing Gerald Ford into the highest circles of the international elite. THE BILDERBERG CONNECTION Bernhard, the founder of a pri vate international annual gathering, known as the Bilderberg meetings, invited the Michigan congressman (just recently appointed to the Warren Commission) to attend the 1964 Bilderberg meeting held in Williamsburg, Virginia on March 20 - 22 of that year. The meetings had been held regularly at locations around the world since 1954, named after the Bilderberg Hotel in Holland where the first such meeting was held. On April 11, 1964 Senator Jacob Javits (R - N.Y.) rose on the Senate floor to announce that he had been in attendance at the 1964 meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia. Joining him at the meeting, according to a list of participants that Javits published in the Congressional Record , was only one other member of Congress — Gerald Ford. Also at the meeting was John J. McCloy, described as \"lawyer and diplomat.\" 878 McCloy, along with Ford, was also at this time a member of the Warren Commission. This international meeting — which concluded precisely four months after the death of President Kennedy — could not have fa iled to have addressed the impact of JFK's assassination on world affairs. What's more, there can be no doubt that the ramifications of a possible conspiracy in the assassination — particularly one emanating from a foreign source (whether it be Castro's Cuba , the Soviet KGB — or the Mossad) — was also the subject of discussion. It is highly unlikely, as a consequence, that the two Warren"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"442 Agents of Influence [345] Commission members present, did not discuss the ongoing inquiry in the \"off - the - record\" meeting taking place over the three - d ay affair. Although the subject of Bilderberg and their impact on world affairs is beyond the scope of this book — and has been analyzed in far better scope elsewhere (particularly in The Spotlight newspaper and now in American Free Press), there is no quest ion Bernhard had ushered Ford into higher ranks than he had ever been in before. Among those who attend the elite Bilderberg meetings — generally no more than roughly 100 - 120 people — are some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world. The Bilder berg meetings — although \"fronted\" by Bernhard — are financed jointly by the Rockefeller and Rothschild families whose representatives are very much in attendance, along with a handful of political figures from the United States and Western Europe, joined by s elect names from major foundations, academia and labor. Also on hand are big names from the media — although they are sworn to secrecy and never report about the private discussions held during the conference. For example: former CIA operative William F. Buc kley, Jr., was invited to the Bilderberg meeting in Cesme, Turkey in 1975 879 but Buckley's \"conservative\" National Review magazine has always assured its readers that there is nothing \"conspiratorial\" about the Bilderberg group. (The connections of Buckle y's family to Israeli oil interests, examined in Chapter 9, are interesting, especially since, as we've seen, the Rothschild family initially dominated Israel's petroleum industry, later selling substantial interests in their Paz conglomerate to Tibor Rose nbaum and Gerald Ford's Michigan benefactor, Max Fisher.) In any event, Gerald Ford himself was cognizant of the big honor that had been bestowed upon him by Prince Bernhard when he was invited to attend this select gathering. \"You don't really belong to t he organization; one gets an invitation from the Prince,\" bragged Ford in 1965. 88 0 (and who in 1966 was once again invited by Tibor Rosenbaum's good friend, Prince Bernhard, to attend this important international conclave). 881 However, Ford's first partic ipation in the Bilderberg meeting in 1964 was not, in fact, the first time he was invited. In 1961 Ford was also invited to attend a Bilderberg gathering in Quebec, but due to a heavy work load and family problems — his children were \"quite ill with scarlet fever\" 882 — young Congressman Ford was unable to attend that elite confab. Thus, it is no stretch of the imagination — nor is it any \"conspiracy theory\" — to suggest that precisely because of his service on the Warren Commission (coupled with his entree into th e Bilderberg elite at precisely the same time), Gerald Ford's ascension to higher office was assured. Other JFK assassination researchers have suggested as much themselves, but they have never explored Ford's connections as we have done here. In this aspec t — as in other aspects relative to the JFK assassination conspiracy and cover - up — Final Judgment pulls no punches in looking at the big picture: the other side of the jigsaw puzzle. However, the far - reaching connections of the international banking establish ment and the Zionist elite into the affairs of the Warren"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"[346] Final Judgment 443 Commission can be found in the resume of yet another commission member. JOHN McCLOY We would be remiss in not discussing the other interesting (and little known) ties of Ford's fellow participant at the 1964 Bilderberg meeting (and fellow Warren Commission member) John McCloy. Although mostly considered by JFK assassination researchers to be a part of the so - called \"WASP Establishment,\" McCloy himself had far - reaching ties into the highest ranks o f the Jewish elite who played a major part in the pro - Israel lobby in America and as patrons of Israel. Not only did McCloy serve as a director of the Empire Trust, 883 a joint financial venture of such powerful international Jewish families as the Lehmans, Loebs and the Bronfmans, 884 but \"his career had long been intertwined with the Warburgs,\" 885 to the extent that he jointly owned property with them 886 but also served as a legal counsel for members of the family. 887 His relationship was so close to the Warburgs that his own mother, a hairdresser, did the hair for Frieda Warburg, one of the family's grande dames. 888 The Warburgs, in fact, emerged as major figures alongside the aforementioned Gerald Ford mentor, Max Fisher and his business partner, Shaul E isenberg, in the financial affairs of Israel. And in 1964 their close associate John McCloy was conveniently serving on the Warren Commission, carefully placed to cover up any Israeli connection to the JFK affair that might emerge. SOM E CONCLUSIONS We ca n rest assured, considering Ford's fealty to Max Fisher, that if Fisher and his mob and Mossad cronies wanted \"inside\" information relating to the Warren Commission inquiry that Ford was willing and able to provide what they needed. Similar conclusions can rightly be reached about John McCloy in light of his close ties to the Warburg family and other interests intimately associated with the fortunes of the state of Israel. Was there \"Jewish influence\" or a \"Jewish presence\" on the Warren Commission? Yes, mo st definitely. What does this mean in terms of the commission's conclusions? Very simply: if the theory put forth in Final Judgment is correct — that Israel's Mossad played a role in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy — then the cover - up mechanism was in place from the very beginning. There was no way that the Warren Commission would have — or could have — ever determined the truth."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Appendix Five JFK's Greenbacks — The Truth About The Federal Reserve Connection.

However, frankly, it seems pretty obvious that JFK was politically astute"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"[348] Final Judgment 445 enough to know that he couldn't make any serious moves against the Fed during his first term when he was facing a tough reelection campaign. During his second term, however, he may well have made such moves. When discussing the family's plans vis - à - vis the Fed, Joe Kennedy was talking in the long term. He knew that it would be impossible, virtually overnight, to dethrone the Fed and its controllers in the internationa l banking community. That's why the ultimate goal of the Kennedy family was to consolidate their power and then move to strip the Fed bare. The fact is, as I do additionally point out in Final Judgment , that there were interest - free U.S. Notes issued durin g the Kennedy administration. I've had a few of them in my own hands — but here's what is critical to remember: these were issued pursuant to a long - standing federal policy of issuing a certain number of U.S. Notes on a regular basis. These notes would have been issued no matter who was president at the time — unless, of course, a populist president had come to power and knocked out the Federal Reserve completely. But that didn't happen. WHAT MARRS SAID . . . Now for those who have cited Marrs' book as a sour ce on this story, I will repeat, verbatim, what Marrs had to say (and this is what other advocates of this theory contend): \"Another overlooked aspect of Kennedy's attempt to reform American society involves money. Kennedy apparently reasoned that by retur ning to the Constitution, which states that only Congress shall coin and regulate money, the soaring national debt could be reduced by not paying interest to the bankers of the Federal Reserve System, who print paper money [and] then loan it to the governm ent at interest. \"He moved in this area on June 4, 1963, by signing Executive order 11,110 which called for the issuance of $4,292,893,815 in United States Notes through the U.S. Treasury rather than the traditional Federal Reserve System. That same day, K ennedy signed a bill changing the backing of one - and two - dollar bills from silver to gold, adding strength to the weakened U.S. currency . . . A number of 'Kennedy bills' were indeed issued — the author has a five - dollar bill in his possession with the headi ng 'United States Note' — but were quickly withdrawn after Kennedy's death.\" 889 MISINFORMATION Now careful readers of Mans' book would no doubt turn to his reference notes to find out his source on this information. I'm sorry to report that he cites my ow n former newspaper, The Spotlight, specifically its issue of October 31, 1988 (page 2), as the source of this information. The reason why I say I'm sorry is because in the very next issue, our weekly newspaper published an apologetic correction from the ed itor indicating that the information was erroneous and should never have been"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"446 JFK’s Greenbacks [349] published. An inexperienced junior editor had inserted a brief news item in a column in the newspaper and it had slipped past the other editors. The information, in fact, was b ased on misinformation that had been circulating for some years in an assortment of other newsletters that had reprinted the story verbatim, without question. Our junior editor had seen the story, found it thought - provoking, and committed it to print. And now, as a consequence of what we reported, the story has taken on additional life, particularly since Jim Marrs cited it and thousands of others have seen Marrs' rendition and accepted it as fact. Since then, Mans has been cited on this time and again, on the Internet in particular. AND NOW FOR THE FACTS . . . So, essentially, at issue is whether Executive Order (EO) 11,110, signed by JFK on June 4, 1963 and supposedly repealed by LBJ within hours of JFK's death, approved more than $4 billion in U.S. Note s, issued directly by the treasury, in place of Federal Reserve Notes which earn interest for the Federal Reserve banks. In fact, it was the Reagan administration — not LBJ — that finally repealed E0 11,110. And this E0 dealt with silver certificates — not green backs — when Reagan signed EO 12,608, which revoked several outdated executive orders. EO 11,110 dealt with granting the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue rules and regulations pertaining to freeing the secretary to act without presidential ap proval on silver bullion sales. As president, JFK revoked both of these with EO 11,110. To repeat, the issuance of \"greenbacks\" (technically known as United States Notes) was not even the subject of JFK's EO 11,110. The greenbacks that were issued during t he Kennedy administration were issued pursuant to long - standing federal legislation mandating that a certain number of U.S. Notes always be in circulation by the Treasury Department although, as we shall see momentarily, the Treasury has not been following that mandate. For those not versed in the intricacies of finance and the Federal Reserve controversy, here's a brief description of U.S. Notes as written by the late Gertrude Coogan, a long - time student of the money question: \"U.S. Notes are the kind of m oney for which the private banker is not charging the taxpayers interest. They are real money and pass today as full legal tender. If all the money in use in this country were issued by the United States government, we would not have periods in which the v olume of money suddenly diminished for some 'mysterious' reason. U.S. Notes draw no interest on their creation, and they cannot be recalled.\" 890 In short, U.S. Notes provide no profit for the private banking interests whereas Federal Reserve Notes do. Howe ver, for the record, we will cite here the correct explanation as to why 1) U.S. Notes were indeed issued during the Kennedy era and why 2) U.S. Notes appear to now be \"withdrawn\" from circulation."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"[350] Final Judgment 447 The fact is that an act of Congress passed on May 31, 18 78 declared that the U.S. Treasury is required to keep $322,539,016 in U.S. Notes in circulation at all times. However, as a Treasury Department officer, Rudy Villareal, then - director of the Currency Operations Division at the Treasury Department admitted to The Spotlight in a 1982 interview, the Treasury itself was not issuing U.S. Notes into circulation even though it was mandated to do so by the long - standing congressional legislation. He said that the U.S. Notes were put in the so - called issue vault, bu t, as The Spotlight commented, \"it would appear that by some sort of semantic wizardry, the bureaucrats consider these locked - up notes to qualify as 'circulating' currency.'\" 891 In fact, it does appear that the last time U.S. Notes were introduced into the economy was during the JFK administration, but — to repeat — it was done not by the special executive order issued by the president that is so often cited by those who say that \"The Federal Reserve Killed JFK.\" Instead, the issuance of U.S. Notes during the K ennedy era was done in pursuance of a law already on the books. Those who cite an executive order by JFK that, in fact, refers to Silver Certificates, are making a big mistake and — unintentionally or not — are doing a disservice to serious research in the JFK assassination conspiracy. I cannot overemphasize this fact. The Spotlight published these stories to try to counteract the misinformation that it played a part in circulating, only to find that there have been so many people committed to the story and so determined to prove that \"The Federal Reserve Killed JFK\" that they have actually taken umbrage at The Spotlight's efforts to set the record straight. GETTING THE STORY STRAIGHT But suffice it to say that The Spotlight was not part of any \"cover - up\" of F ed involvement. Instead, The Spotlight was trying to get at the truth of the matter, no matter what the cost, and attempting to prevent sincere patriots and critics of the Fed from embarrassing themselves by circulating misinformation that will only make t hem look foolish and give further ammunition to the Fed when it seeks to discredit its critics. I do indeed hope that this will set the record straight. There's no doubt, as I've said, that the would - be Kennedy Dynasty had big plans to undo the Federal Res erve monopoly on America's money, but EO 11,110 was most emphatically not part of that long - range plan. This story does continue to pop up again and again despite the efforts by The Spotlight and others to set the record straight, it's taken on a life of i ts own and I'm truly afraid that the story will never be put to rest. In concluding this overview of the Federal Reserve \"connection\" to the JFK assassination it is probably appropriate here to address, once again, but from a different angle, the basic fla w in the theory (popular among \"liberal\" JFK assassination researchers) that the conspiracy behind the assassination was \"right wing\" in nature."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"448 JFK’s Greenba cks [351] Perhaps the best example of how misguided this theory really is (and how the theory itself is based on a misu nderstanding of just what precisely constitutes the thinking of the \"right wing\" in America) can be found in Walt Brown's informative book, Treachery in Dallas , one of the better of the more recent efforts to understand the JFK puzzle. THE 'RIGHT WING' AN D THE FEDERAL RESERVE Although Brown appears to be quite sincere and is surely not trying to circulate disinformation, he pinpoints a \"right wing\" motive for the assassination of President Kennedy that just simply is not a motive for the \"right wing.\" Bro wn delves into the sticky question of JFK's stance in relationship to the privately - owned money monopoly known as the Federal Reserve System and rehashes the popular myth that we've dissected above. In Treachery in Dallas Brown writes: \"When 'U.S. Notes' a ppear in 1962, they cost big business, as well as banking interests, a great deal of money because the government, not the banks, had become the brokering agent. Those 'U.S. Notes' disappeared, after November 22, as suddenly as they had appeared.\" 892 He adds further: \"`Big money' interests in the United States took serious notice of the fact that Kennedy saw to the beginning of the issuance of 'U.S. Notes,' currency that was introduced into our economy as need arose by, of all groups, the U.S. Treasury, t he group constitutionally obligated to do so. Other moneys were 'brokered' into the system by the Federal Reserve, of which there is no mention in the Constitution, which is silent on private corporations controlling the issuance of American currency.\" 893 While Brown's basic analysis of the basic way the Fed works is on the mark (but factually incorrect as far as the actual details of the reason why the U.S. Notes were issued) Brown makes an egregious mistake when he cites the issuance of U.S. Notes as par t of his evidence of a \"right wing\" motive for wanting John F. Kennedy removed from the White House. The fact is that Brown's perception of what constitutes \"right wing\" versus \"left wing\" (or any wing, for that matter) in American politics is obviously of f base, for if Brown did any semblance of investigating, he would find that it is the American \"right wing\" that has been so vociferously critical of the Federal Reserve System. With a few rare exceptions, such as two Texas populists of the left — Rep. Wrigh t Patman and Rep. Henry Gonzalez — and Rep. Jerry Voorhis, the California Democrat whom Richard Nixon defeated for re election to the House of Representatives, the fiercest and most vocal critics of the Federal Reserve and its money manipulation have been \"r ight wing\" populists, ranging from Father Charles Coughlin, the radio priest of the 1930’s to Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz, the widely - decorated Vietnam War hero who ran for president as an independent candidate in the 1992 election. Gritz himself claimed that th e first thing he would do when elected president would be to re - instate JFK's executive order issuing U.S. Notes into the economy. But, as we have seen, there was no such executive order."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"[352] Final Judgment 449 JFK's stance toward the Federal Reserve was, thus, a \"right wing\" stance — more so than a \"liberal\" or \"progressive\" stance — particularly in light of the fact that — as we saw early on in Final Judgment in Chapter 4 — JFK's tutelage on this issue came at his father's very \"right wing\" knee. It is interesting to note that the af orementioned Jim Marrs also includes the theory that \"The Federal Reserve Killed JFK\" — my description of the myth, not his — in his chapter in Crossfire entitled \"Rednecks and Oilmen — Right - wing Extremists and Texas Millionaires\" as though there is some relati on between the interests of the \"right wing extremists\" and the controllers of the Federal Reserve. Again, as we have seen, this is based on misperception at best and bad research at worst, but it does further muddy the waters on an already controversial e lement of an even more controversial overall topic. The Federal Reserve certainly has it within its power the ability to manipulate \"right wing extremists\" for its own purposes. However, as we have seen in our appendix on Guy Banister and his \"right wing\" associates, there can be detected a \"right wing\" connection (so to speak) to the JFK assassination conspiracy, but there is certainly much more to the story than Brown and Marrs and others clearly understand (or perhaps care to say). The banking interests that profit from the Federal Reserve monopoly are, it should be noted, tied closely to the European Rothschild dynasty as documented in such works as Eustace Mullins' monumental study, The Federal Reserve Conspiracy, which is undoubtedly the most authorita tive work on the subject and one which has been the cornerstone of all subsequent writing on the subject. So when one recalls that the Rothschild family, in fact, has been a primary patron of the state of Israel, we can easily suggest, then, that even the theory that \"The Federal Reserve Killed JFK\" has its own legitimate ring of truth, insofar as the role of Israel's Mossad — in league with the CIA and the Lansky mob — does indeed point back to a Rothschild and Federal Reserve connection to the assassination conspiracy. THE EVIDENCE REFUTES THE MYTH . . . One last important item worthy of mention: illustrated in the photo section of Final Judgment is a 1966 United States Note. I have held this 1966 United States Note in my hands. It is genuine. It is in the private possession of a veteran critic of the Federal Reserve System. The very fact that this 1966 United States Note exists is proof positive that it is an absolute myth that no United States Notes were issued after 1963. It is thus a myth that President Johnson withdrew all U.S. Notes from circulation upon assuming the presidency after the death of JFK. In the end, those who are truly seeking the facts about the JFK assassination conspiracy do themselves no service by promulgating false information about the Federal Reserve connection. Thus, I am pleased to be able to use this opportunity in an attempt to set the record straight."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Appendix Six Retribution?

The August 20, 1996 issue of The Sun, a supermarket tabloid, carried an excitin g \"newsflash\" which announced \"Dead CIA Chief Was Set to Finally Blow Lid on JFK Assassination.\" 894 The tabloid announced that former CIA director William Colby had been planning to blow the whistle on the truth about the assassination of President Kenned y. Although the tabloid provided no evidence whatsoever that this was the case, there is no question but that Colby's strange demise did give many people — and not just so - called \"conspiracy theorists\" — reason to pause. Colby himself had indeed made cryptic r emarks about the JFK assassination in one interview shortly before his death, so perhaps there is reason for suspicion. However, as we shall see, there is strong evidence to suggest that if indeed William Colby did have \"inside\" knowledge about the assassi nation of President Kennedy and knew that Israeli intelligence was indeed involved — Colby would have been the most likely former high - ranking intelligence figure to blow the whistle. Upon what basis can such an assertion be made? The fact is, that while ser ving as CIA director, William Colby was considered hostile to Israel's interests, so much so that it was Colby who actually fired the Mossad's longtime agent - in - place at the CIA, James Jesus Angleton, who has been documented in Final Judgment as the key CI A player in the JFK assassination conspiracy. ISRAEL THE SOURCE OF FRICTION Evidently, most press reports at the time, describing Colby's sacking of Angleton, didn't tell the whole story. However, according to Wolf Blitzer, longtime Washington correspond ent for the Jerusalem Post: \"CBS News"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"[354] Final Judgment 451 reported back in 1975 that Angleton had lost his job in December 1974 because of policy disputes over Israel and not because of allegations of CIA domestic spying, as originally reported . . . [and that] Angleton was said to have argued with CIA director William Colby over Middle East policy questions as well.\" 895 In fact, according to Blitzer, it was one week before the New York Times first published a story by Seymour Hersh alleging that the CIA was engaged in domes tic spying that Colby had told Angleton that he could no longer handle the Israeli desk at the CIA after which Angleton resigned — effectively forced out by Colby. 896 A TWISTED MIND . . . By as early as 1967 Angleton's behavior had become so bizarre that on one of Angleton's trips to Israel, John Denley Walker, the CIA's station chief in Israel, believed that Angleton was \"on the edge of a nervous breakdown.\" 897 However, upon his ouster from the CIA in December of 1974, Angleton, it appears, may have actua lly gone over the edge. CBS News reporter Daniel Schorr has described meeting with Angleton just shortly after he had been dismissed by Colby. According to Schorr, Angleton \"rambled on circuitously, the conversation disjoined. He had been to Israel thirty times. He had never met Howard Hunt . . .\" 898 (Again, Angleton's denial of knowing Hunt, which we discussed in Chapter 16.) Angleton added that: \"For twenty - two years I handled the Israeli account. Israel was the only sanity in the Middle East.\" 899 As An gleton's ravings continued, Schorr decided that Angleton \"was really crazy.\" 900 Schorr said that Angleton \"went on speaking almost as though I wasn't there. He was talking as though he was looking into his own mind.\" 901 So it was that Israel's biggest part isan at the CIA had gone completely out of his mind — and a new CIA director, William Colby, was perceived as being hostile to Angleton's friends in Israel. COLBY vs ISRAEL Wolf Blitzer has written of how many high - ranking U.S. intelligence officials didn' t share Angleton's enthusiasm for Israel, citing Colby as a specific example: \"Many [such intelligence figures] have been much more concerned with the U.S. standing in the Arab world. Their assessment of the U.S. national interest has dovetailed more with the traditional Arabist view at the State Department than with the Angleton . . . school of thought. \"In 1975, for example, there was an increasing concern among Israel's intelligence officials over what appeared to be a growing pro - Arab tilt among several senior analysts in the CIA. The November 1975 closed - door testimony on the Middle East arms balance offered by outgoing CIA Director William Colby was one of the first indications of this attitude. \"Colby, who had just been dismissed by President Ford but was asked to remain in office until his designated successor, Ambassador George Bush,"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"452 Retribution? [355] returned from China and won Senate confirmation, argued in his testimony that the balance of power in the Middle East was shifting in Israel's favor. His testimony, wh ich disputed figures offered by Israeli officials, was widely seen as having damaged the administration's own pending request before the Congress for $1.5 billion in military aid for Israel during that fiscal year. A SERIOUS SETBACK \"Israel's cause in th e CIA bureaucracy, of course, had suffered a serious setback earlier that year when Colby fired Angleton . . . [whose] strong stance against the Soviets led him to believe that American national interests demanded a strong Israel in the Middle East to coun ter increasing Soviet gains . . . [and as a consequence] . . . Colby's controversial testimony against Israel was the further expression of the same attitudes that had drawn Angleton from the CIA. \"Washington correspondent Daniel Schorr, working in 1975 fo r CBS, reported that there was a strong pro - Arab faction in the CIA and only a small pro - Israel faction, and he said this pro - Arab group strongly influenced decisions . . . [as a result that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger attempted to] weaken Colby's a rguments on the Middle East arms balance\" 902 citing previous errors in CIA assessments relating to the Middle East that were perceived to be \"pro - Arab\" in their stance. So it was that William Colby himself was ultimately fired from the CIA, having run afo ul of Israel and its lobby in Washington. Thus, it should be no surprise for readers to learn that shortly before his \"accidental\" death, Colby had entered into negotiations to begin high - level consulting work for Arab interests — an interesting little detai l that seems to have been forgotten in much of the speculation surrounding Colby's death. COLBY AND THE ARABS In the spring of 1996, Colby contacted a veteran journalist whom he knew to be friendly to top Arab diplomatic, military and intelligence offici als and requested that the journalist arrange for Colby to meet with a certain high - level Arab officia1. 903 The first meeting was held at the exclusive (and infamous) Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. (The author of Final Judgment learned of Colby's meet ing with the Arab official after Colby's initial disappearance but before Colby's dead body surfaced on May 5, 1996. The author's source for the information was the very journalist who had arranged the meeting.) According to a former federal security admin istrator who attended one of the meetings, Colby and his Arab associate \"had shared concerns. Both men knew that their respective governments were being infiltrated and manipulated by Israeli agents. Both of them had long fought this trend.\" 904 Following these meetings, Colby agreed to go to work as a confidential advisor to Arab interests. One can only imagine Israel's reaction to this"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"[356] Final Judgment 453 decision by a former CIA director aligning himself with the interests of their hated enemies, the Arabs. THE ISRAELI L OBBY's CIA POWER GRAB It is interesting to note further that Colby's death came at a critical time when the Israeli lobby in Washington was engaged in a major behind - the - scenes effort to substantially expand the power of the CIA and its then - director, Joh n Deutch, a Belgian - born Jewish refugee and longtime Washington figure known for his close ties to Israeli intelligence. The so - called \"reform\" measures — designed to increase the power of the CIA director — were of such a nature that a genuine CIA reformer su ch as William Colby would have certainly emerged as a very loud and very public critic of such proposals, particularly since the fine hand of the Israeli lobby was very clearly at work behind the scenes. On April 24, 1996 — two days before Colby disappeared — a little - noted Senate committee vote laid the groundwork for a bizarre and unprecedented proposed restructuring of the U.S. civilian and military intelligence system. Sen. Arlen Specter — the infamous former Warren Commission staff attorney — now the Republica n chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (and a leading congressional supporter of Israel) pushed through a vote on a measure to extend the author of the CIA director to control the budgets of all U.S. intelligence agencies, most of which were then under the purview of the military divisions. Under Specter's proposal (which was fully endorsed by Deutch) the CIA director would also have been granted the authority to play a major role in the appointments of the directors of the various intelligence age ncies, including those inside the Pentagon. This would put Deutch in control of not only the CIA but also the national Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office and the Defense Intelligence Agency, as well as the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine intelligence groups. 905 On April 25 even the Washington Post was moved to comment (quite correctly) that \"Such a radical change is likely to run into strong opposition not only from the military services themselves but also from other congressional committ ees with Pentagon oversight. The Senate Armed Services Committee had already sent a letter to Specter saying it wants to hold off action on any of the reforms that would limit powers of the Pentagon, such as the proposal to give the [CIA director] a role i n the naming of agency heads.\" 906 Certainly, this proposal was extraordinary, to say the least, but it was fully in keeping with an ongoing push (at that time) to expand the influence of the CIA and its current director, John Deutch. After assuming his CI A post, Deutch was greeted by numerous laudatory articles in the mainstream media proclaiming that there was — as Parade magazine cooed in a favorable cover story — a \"new CIA\" 907 under"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"454 Retribution? [357] Deutch's control. This assessment, in fact, was true, in as much as nev er before (not even in the days of James Angleton) did Israeli intelligence have such influence at all levels of the CIA. Likewise, the May 6, 1996 issue of Time (owned by the Bronfman family, major patrons of Israel) featured a glowing four - page story abo ut \"the formidable John Deutch\" 9 0 8 whom the Bronfman magazine crowed was \"becoming the most powerful CIA chief ever,\" 909 concluding by saying that \"what is good for John Deutch may be good for the CIA. \" 91 0 In fact, in the end, the CIA power grab orchest rated by the Israeli sympathizers in Washington was defeated but, in the meantime, of course, t h e m a n w h o w o u l d h a v e b e e n o n e o f i t s m o s t e f f e c t i v e opponents — William Colby — had been removed from the scene. WHO KILLED COLBY? After Colby's body was found, o ne of his Arab associates commented as to his views regarding Colby's demise: \"Look to the Jewish,\" 911 he remarked. It is said, additionally, that Mrs. Colby herself does not buy the claim that her husband's death was an accident. However, as an experience d diplomat, wise to the dangerous ways of the world of intelligence, she has no percentage in going public with her suspicions and probably never will. Thus, it is highly unlikely that Colby's real views on the JFK assassination itself will ever be made pu blic. However, we do know his views toward Israel and its influence on U.S. policy - making. It is probably no coincidence then that one of Colby's protégés from the days when Colby served in the CIA in Vietnam is — like his mentor — a sharp critic of Israeli in trigue. John DeCamp, a former army officer in Vietnam who served under Colby and who is now a prominent maverick lawyer in Nebraska, tangled with the Israeli lobby during the years that he (DeCamp) served in the Nebraska legislature. DeCamp recalls Colby's own words of warning to DeCamp which are probably worth noting here, particularly in light of Colby's demise: \"Sometimes there are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do anything about them, no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face.\" 912 ANOTHER STRANGE DEATH Colby's words are quite striking whe n one considers that Colby's death on the water recalled to many another similar strange death and one that, in fact, may truly be linked in some way to the JFK assassination conspiracy and which involves another attempt by a CIA official to resist Israeli intrigue in Washington. We refer to the death — the murder — of John Paisley, the former longtime deputy director of the CIA's Office of Strategic Research, who was"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"[358] Final Judgment 455 found floating in the Chesapeake Bay on November 1, 1978, dead from a bullet in the head. Al though his death was ruled a \"suicide,\" few believed it then and few believe it today. It was not only the similar circumstances of the deaths of the two men that observers found so intriguing. What was more notable is that Paisley — like Colby — had adamantly tried to resist high - level Israeli intrigue. Paisley had discovered — and tried to block — a major Israeli penetration operation targeting the CIA's Office of National Estimates, where the command - level intelligence summaries guiding U.S. presidential decisio ns were compiled. What's more there is no question but that Paisley — perhaps even more so than Colby — had good reason to know long - hidden intelligence secrets relating to the CIA's manipulation of JFK's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. It is thus probabl y no coincidence that Paisley died at a critical juncture during the House Select Committee on Assassinations Investigation at which time the committee was exploring — or at least pretending to explore — possible CIA links to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassin ation of President Kennedy. PAISLEY AND OSWALD Altho ugh Paisley's name never came up during the House investigation, one of its reports said an ex - CIA employee had revealed that \"the CIA maintained a large volume of information on the [Soviet] radio fact ory in which Oswald had worked. The information was stored in the Office of Research and Reports\" 913 — which would have been Paisley's office at the relevant time. Thus, if Oswald were in fact a CIA asset while posing as a \"defector\" in the Soviet Union, as many have suggested, John Paisley — if anyone — would have known it. PAISLEY AND ANGLETON There's another detail relating to the Paisley saga that's probably worth noting: According to veteran intelligence journalist Tad Szulc, the 25 - year old Paisley was r ecruited into the CIA in 1948 when he went to Palestine as a radio operator for the UN peacekeeping mission. And according to Szulc, it was none other than Israel's friend at the CIA — James Angleton — who recruited Paisley into the CIA at this time. 914 This is interesting inasmuch as, according to journalist Jim Hougan, \"Under oath before the Senate, and over drinks with a member of Paisley's family, Angleton swore that he himself had never met Paisley.\" 9 15 However, as Hougan points out, there are many who f ind it \"incredible\" 916 that Angleton and Paisley, both career CIA officers with counterintelligence responsibilities involving the Soviet Union should never have met. Angleton's denial of having known Paisley recalls Angleton's similar denial (documented i n Chapter 16 of Final Judgment) of having known E. Howard Hunt when all evidence would suggest otherwise."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"456 Retribution? [359] Veteran JFK assassination investigator Dick Russell has looked into the Paisley affair. And while Russell has been careful to steer clear of ever me ntioning the possibility of an Israeli connection to the JFK assassination, Russell has concluded this much about Paisley's death: \"Whatever Paisley was doing in his last years, right up to the moment of his disappearance, it apparently traced back to the Kennedy era. And I do not believe that the timing of his disappearance — coming as it had amid a congressional focus on [what the CIA and the Soviets knew about Lee Harvey Oswald] — was coincidental.\" 917 (emphasis added) PAISLEY vs ISRAEL What was it that Paisley was involved in just before his death? The answer to this question points directly toward solving the question of who killed Paisley and why. And it relates again — precisely — to the conclusions that we have reached in Final Judgment regarding the que stion of who killed John F. Kennedy and why. Although the death of John Paisley has been of much fascination to those who have charted the covert wars between the CIA and the KGB (of which James Angleton was very much a part), it is quite notable that thos e who have delved into Paisley's demise have — like Dick Russell — been reticent to discuss what is very clearly the Mossad connection to the affair. In the years prior to Paisley's demise, hawkish factions in the Israeli government were lobbying hard in Washi ngton for more arms aid and cash infusions through the U.S. foreign aid program. Loyal supporters of Israel such as Sen. Henry Jackson (D - Wash.) argued that Israel needed more military might to protect the Middle East against \"Soviet aggression\" — an argumen t that delighted hard - line anti - communists in both political parties. 918 This, of course, was the same argument that had long been advanced by the Mossad's chief ally at the CIA, James J. Angleton. However, U.S. intelligence analysts were scoffing at Israe l's alarmist cries. Led by senior analysts in the Office of National Estimates, they reassured the White House that, at least for the moment, the Soviets had neither the intent nor the capability to attack a major target of vital U.S. interest, such as the oil - rich Gulf states. 919 A - TEAM vs B - TEAM Nonetheless, Israel's Washington allies maneuvered in an effort to counter - balance the findings of the Office of National Estimates. Thus, under political pressure, President Gerald Ford agreed in mid - 1976 (whi le George Bush was serving as CIA director) to institute a so - called \"audit\" of intelligence data provided by the CIA's own National Intelligence Officers (soon to be called the \"A - Team\"] by a committee of \"independent\" experts — known as the \"B - Team.\" 920 Th e prime mover behind the concept of such an audit was Leo Cherne, a veteran figure in the Israeli lobby who also had long - standing connections"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"[360] Final Ju dgment 457 to the Bush family. In 1962 Cherne, along with Prescott Bush Sr. and Prescott Bush, Jr. — father and brother of t he future CIA director — as well as yet another future CIA director, William Casey, founded the National Strategy Information Center which effectively functioned as a distribution center for CIA - approved \"information\" sent to some 300 newspapers internationa lly. 921 However, as we noted in Appendix One of Final Judgment , the newly established and ostensibly \"independent\" group — B - Team — headed by Harvard professor Richard Pipes, a devout supporter of Israel, became an outpost of Israeli influence. And, of course , not surprisingly — considering his familial attachment to B - Team sponsor Leo Cherne — then CIA Director George Bush became a promoter of the B - Team's findings. PAISLEY vs THE B - TEAM It was John Paisley, recently retired from the CIA, who was assigned to pr ovide liaison and guidance between the CIA's in - house A - Team and the B - Team. However, Paisley was not enthralled with the efforts of the B - Team. According to Meade Rowington, a former U.S. counterintelligence analyst: \"It soon became clear to Paisley that these cosmopolitan intellectuals were simply trying to discredit the CIA's recommendations and replace them with the alarmist view of Soviet intentions favored by Israeli estimators.\" 922 As a consequence, during the next two years, Paisley launched his own internal intelligence community campaign against the Israeli attempt to manipulate U.S. policy - making. He also started talking to Washington newsmen and congressional investigators, exposing what he saw happening. According to one of Paisley's friends, \"H e met with physicists and other scientists who knew Israel was wildly exaggerating Soviet military capabilities and war plans. But he was privately told, time and again, that nothing could be done about it.\" 923 By early 1978 the B - Team had finished its re view of the CIA's procedures and programs and issued a lengthy report that was harshly critical of almost every finding U.S. intelligence had made in previous years about Soviet military power and its intended uses. ISRAELI DISINFORMATION The Israeli - inf luenced B - Team report said that the Soviets were secretly developing a so - called \"first - strike\" capability, because Soviet strategic doctrine assumed that such a sneak attack would make them the winners of a nuclear exchange with the United States. The B - T eam dismissed the estimates of analysts such as Paisley and others who held that Moscow was unlikely to start a nuclear conflict unless attacked. In the end, of course, the B - Team findings prevailed and the direct consequence was that there was a virtual r evival of the arms race and a massive new infusion of U.S. military and other aid to Israel during the 1980. 924"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"458 Retribution? [361] Drawing on fraudulent estimates provided by Israeli intelligence — the foundation of the B - Team's report was the warning that the Soviet Union was fast running out of energy. As a consequence, the B - Team forecast that beginning in 1980 Soviet oil production would suffer critical shortfalls, forcing Moscow to import as much as 4.5 million barrels a day for its essential needs. Starved for oil — the Israeli disinformation claimed — the Soviets would invade Iran or another oil - rich Gulf state even if it meant a nuclear confrontation with the United States. 925 ONE MAN CAMPAIGN None of this was even remotely true — and John Paisley and others knew it. Non etheless, Paisley carried on his one - man drive to counter the distortions, exaggerations, and Israeli influence behind the B - Team arguments. Although the team's final report was secret, with access reserved for a handful of government leaders, Paisley repo rtedly got his hands on a copy of the report in the summer of 1978 and set to work writing a detailed critique that would destroy this Israeli disinformation. 926 But Paisley was murdered before he could ever complete his task. According to Richard Clement, who headed the Interagency Committee on Counterterrrorism during the Reagan administration: \"The Israelis had no compunction about 'terminating' key American intelligence officials who threatened to blow the whistle on them. Those of us familiar with the case of Paisley know that he was killed by the Mossad. But no one, not even in Congress, wants to stand up and say so publicly.\" 927 INMAN AND PAISLEY Orlando Trommer, a retired federal security official, has commented: \"Of course, Paisley was right.\" 92 8 Trommer said that when he heard former Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, a one - time deputy director of the CIA (and, like Paisley, a critic of the B - Team) publicly call for the breakup of the CIA and stripping it of its intelligence collection duties, Trommer tol d himself: \"I know what he means. This is one for you, John.\" 929 Readers will recall that when President Bill Clinton nominated the aforementioned Admiral Inman to serve as Secretary of Defense, Inman suddenly withdrew his name from consideration at a pre ss conference on January 18, 1994. At that time Inman said, in no uncertain terms, that he was withdrawing because he had no desire to subject himself to what he called the \"new McCarthyism.\" 93 0 That is, Inman said he was being attacked in the media — parti cularly by syndicated columnist William Safire — because he (Inman) had run afoul of Safire and the Israeli lobby in years prior. ANOTHER CRITIC OF ISRAEL"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"[362] Final Judgment 459 Inman described how in 1981 when the Israelis had bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor, he (Inman) discover ed that the Israelis had been able to carry out their act precisely because they had gained access to high - level Pentagon satellite reconnaissance files. At that juncture, Inman, then serving as acting CIA director during CIA director William Casey's absen ce from the country, gave orders limiting Israeli access to such strategic national intelligence. In response, according to Inman, \"The [Israeli] defense minister, General Sharon, was so furious he came to the U.S. to protest to [Secretary of Defense] Wein berger.\" 931 But Weinberger — himself a critic of Israel — stood behind Inman. Then, after CIA Director Casey returned to the United States, William Safire — a longtime friend and a former campaign manager for Casey when Casey made an unsuccessful bid for Congre ss — complained to Casey who countermanded Inman's decision. According to Inman, \"from that point on, if you will trace the [media] coverage [of Inman], it's been hostile.\" 9 32 THE CASEY CONNECTION(S) An interesting note regarding William Casey: as CIA dir ector, Casey was a valued ally of Israel in Washington and it was under Casey's stewardship that the CIA became entangled in the infamous Iran - Contra affair in which Israel was a primary player. Casey's o wn ties are somewhat suggestive of a long - standing c onnection to not only Israeli intelligence but to other elements that have popped up in the course of inquiries into the JFK assassination conspiracy. According to organized crime writer Dan Moldea, Casey was the founder, general counsel and member of the board of directors of Multiponics, an agribusiness firm that owned some 44,000 acres of farmland in several southern states including Louisiana. 933 One of Casey's partners in the venture was one Carl Biehl whom Moldea describes as \"an associate of underwo rld figures in the Carlos Marcello crime family in New Orleans.\" 934 (In Chapter 10, of course, we examined the Marcello - Lansky syndicate connection in some detail.) What is particularly interesting, though, is that when the Multiponics venture between Cas ey and the Marcello associate filed for bankruptcy in 1971, it owed some $20.6 million to various creditors including none other than Bernard Cornfeld of Investors Overseas Services, 935 whom we discovered in Chapter 7 was functioning as a front man for Ti bor Rosenbaum's international money laundering ventures for the Mossad. (And we have to wonder, obviously, if Casey's IOS deal wasn't, in fact, some sort of covert venture — even the means for a pay - off from the Mossad disguised as a loan gone bad. It's spe culation, but food for thought.) Later, after Casey became CIA director, he appointed as his deputy director of operations in charge of covert action and overseas clandestine intelligence gathering (the old post held by James Angleton) an equally interesti ng figure: one Max Hugel, an official with the Centronics Data Computer Corporation."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"460 Retribution? [363] According to Dan Moldea: \"A portion of Centronics was owned until 1974 by Caesar's World, the casino gambling company, then under federal investigation for alleged hidde n mob ownership, when Hugel's previous firm, Brother International Corporation, bought Caesar's World's holdings in Centronics. Also Centronics had a consultancy relationship with mobster Moe Dalitz and his Las Vegas casinos.\" 936 In Chapter 10 and in Chap ter 15 and in our appendix on the Warren Commission we examined the history of Moe Dalitz and his intimate ties to the Lansky syndicate and Tibor Rosenbaum's Permindex operation that has been linked to the JFK assassination conspiracy. We now find yet anot her Dalitz connection to the highest levels of the CIA. CASUALTIES OF WAR Suffice it to say that there has been a very long and definitive and influential Mossad influence within the CIA and we can thus understand why when the CIA's deputy director, Admi ral Bobby Ray Inman, had reason to question Mossad influence that he found himself slapped down by William Casey on more occasions than one. Although it (apparently) has no direct bearing on the JFK assassination, the conflict that Bobby Ray Inman had with Israel and its powerful lobby in Washington does indeed illustrate what can happen to high - ranking American officials who run afoul of Israel by questioning its power and influence on U.S. policy - making. Inman, in his own fashion, was as much a casualty o f behind - the - scenes secret wars with Israel as were those before him such as William Colby, John Paisley and John F. Kennedy. Whether, in fact, there is a direct link between the deaths of Colby and Paisley and that of John F. Kennedy we will not likely ev er know. But the facts about their deaths all do point toward an Israeli connection. And for that reason alone it is appropriate to note this here in Final Judgment . THE ANGLETON CONNECTION Rest assured that we have not, however, seen the last of Israel' s CIA ally — and Colby's nemesis — James Angleton, in the pages of Final Judgment . In Appendix Seven we will be exploring his little - known role in that other coup d'etat known as \"Watergate.\" And we will see indeed that there is a connection between Watergate and the JFK assassination — and that connection is Angleton."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Appendix Seven \"Deep Throat\" Dallas and Watergate Were Connected — But Not in the Way That Many People Think. James Jesus Angleton, Israel and the Fall of Richard M. Nixon The Dallas - Watergate C onnection has been the basis for an incredible amount of misinformation and disinformation since the fall of Richard Nixon in 1974. There is indeed a Dallas - Watergate Connection — but it's one that even the most intrepid JFK assassination researchers have so mehow seemed to miss. The true Dallas - Watergate Connection is the long - hidden role of Israel's CIA man, James Jesus Angleton — the prime CIA mover not only behind the JFK assassination but also the forced resignation of Richard M. Nixon. For years a wide ar ray of self - styled JFK assassination researchers have gone to great lengths to find a \"Dallas - Watergate Connection.\" Peter Dale Scott and Carl Oglesby have written at length on the subject. Many others have also delved into the topic. Primarily the researc hers seem to focus on one thing alone: the fact that \"former\" CIA man, E. Howard Hunt, the ringleader of the team that burglarized the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, had formerly been the CIA's liaison to the anti - Cas tro Cuban exiles during the years of the CIA - mob assassination plots against Fidel Castro. However, as we shall see in this appendix, there is much more to the \"Dallas - Watergate Connection\" than meets the eye — and if truth be told, the real connection is th e hidden role played by Israel's CIA ally, James Jesus Angleton, not only in the assassination of President Kennedy but also in the Watergate intrigue that led to the fall of Richard Nixon. In fact, as we shall see, Nixon — like JFK — had begun to run afoul of the Israelis and — like JFK — was targeted for destruction. NIXON: 'GET ME THE FILES . . .' In light of what we now know about John F. Kennedy's bitter conflict with Israel over its determined intent to develop a nuclear arsenal, it is quite interesting ind eed to learn, according to journalist Leslie Cockburn, that \"when Nixon came into office, the second thing he asked J. Edgar Hoover to do for him was 'Get me the files on Israeli nuclear espionage.' \" 937 And considering Hoover's own close ties to the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, an American intelligence conduit for Israel's Mossad, we cannot help but wonder if the news of Nixon's unusual interest in this subject did not somehow make its way to Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"462 “Deep Throat” [365] Although, as president, Richard Nixon was generally perceived as a friend of Israel, there were long - standing suspicions about Nixon in the American Jewish community in general. Nixon had barely won the presidency in 1968, narrowly defeating Hubert Humphrey, a devoted supporter of Israel who was highly popular among Jewish voters. However, in 1972 Nixon was overwhelmingly re - elected in one of the largest popular landslides in American history and, at that juncture, Nixon evidently decided that he had a genuine mandate to actually begin flexing some real clout. In fact, according to former White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, writing in his book The Ends of Power, the president intended to overhaul the entire federal bureaucracy and bring it under the direct control of his own handpicked loyalists in the White House inner circle — trusted longtime colleagues who were not part of the Establishment elite. \"Reorganization,\" says Haldeman, \"is the secret story of Watergate. That reorganization in the winter of 1972 — very li ttle known to the American public — eventually spurred into action against Nixon the great power blocs in Washington. \"All of them saw danger as the hated Nixon moved more and more to control the executive branch from the White House, as he was Constitutiona lly mandated to do. What they feared was real. Nixon genuinely meant to take the reins of government in hand, and if members of the Congress had been privy to a presidential conversation on September 15, 1972, they would have been even more fearful.\" 938 Ac cording to Haldeman, Nixon said, \"We're going to have a housecleaning. It's time for a new team. Period. I'm going to [tell the American people] we didn't do it when we came in before, but now we have a mandate. And one of the mandates is to do the cleanin g up that we didn't do in 1968.\" 939 As the proposed housecleaning was described by Haldeman: \"Not only would [Nixon] tightly control all reigns of the government through eight top officers in the White House; he would plant his own 'agents' in key position s in every agency of the government.\" 940 Clearly, Nixon had big plans: he was actually going to assert himself and attempt to gain control of the executive branch and its myriad agencies. This move, needless to say, made many in the American Jewish commun ity uneasy. Rumors of Nixon's \"lists\" of Jews in high - ranking positions in the executive branch and the agencies began circulating, adding fuel to the already long - standing suspicions of Nixon. And as all of this was taking place in the United States, even ts in the Middle East began to unfold that set a new tone to Israel's perception of the American president. NIXON CROSSES THE ISRAELIS Following his massive 1972 re - election victory, Nixon crossed the line as far as his previous support for Israel was co ncerned. In 1973, the Nixon"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"[366 ] Final Judgment 463 administration knew of the planned attack on Israel by Syria and Egypt thirty hours before the United States actually notified Israel. 941 According to pro - Israel Nixon critics, John Loftus and Mark Aarons, Nixon's staff \"had at least two days advance warning that an attack was coming . . . but no one in the Nixon White House warned the Jews until the last few hours on the day of the attack.\" 942 Loftus and Aarons say that, \"Although our sources think that incompetence, not mali ce, was the reason for delaying the warning, Nixon certainly had a motive for revenge . . . Nixon was well aware that, apart from J. Edgar Hoover, only the Israelis knew enough about his past to cause him major political damage. 943 \"As the Watergate tape - recordings show, Nixon was terribly afraid of the Jews. He made lists of his enemies and kept track of Jewish Americans in his administration . . . Whatever the motive, during September and October 1973 the Nixon White House turned a blind eye toward Sadat 's plans for a consolidated sneak attack against the Jews.\" 944 There is other evidence that Nixon was making behind - the - scenes efforts to foil the power and influence of the Israeli lobby, despite the widespread perception today that Nixon was somehow a \" friend\" of Israel. For example, respected British journalist Alan Hart has noted that as early as 1973 Nixon's Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, was warning the government of Israel that Nixon might be preparing to cut off arms to Israel. The truth is, as Hart has pointed out, Nixon was actively aligning himself (behind the scenes) with King Feisal of Saudi Arabia in attempting to resolve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict once and for all. Hart has described Nixon's efforts (through the good offices of Ki ng Feisal) to engage Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in back - channel negotiations for a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement. However, when Kissinger learned of the negotiations (which had initially been conducted behind his back) he intervened and put a kibosh on the Nixon - Feisal peace effort, evidently viewing it as a threat to Israel. In addition, Hart has noted that, according to his sources, at one point Nixon himself told King Feisal that if the Israelis and their American lobby continued to fr ustrate Nixon's efforts to settle the Middle East conflict that he — Nixon — was fully intent upon tearing up his pre - prepared State of the Union address and go on national television and radio and explain to the American people how Israel and its American lob by were the real obstacle to peace in the Middle East. (For a full overview of these matters — plus much more on the intrigue of Israel — see Alan Hart's 1984 volume, Arafat — Terrorist or Peacemaker? Published by London - based Sidgwick & Jackson.) Clearly, there was much more afoot behind the scenes in the fateful years of 1973 - 1974 during which time the Watergate scandal began to escalate and — ultimately — bring down Richard Nixon. He — like John F. Kennedy before him — was engaged in a secret war with Israel, and, as this"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"464 ”Deep Throat” [367] chapter unfolds, we shall see precisely ho w the same forces that undermined JFK ultimately eviscerated Nixon. There is, in fact, evidence that high - level plans to move against Nixon were already underway — even before his big re - election victory in 19 72. In a March 24, 1974 interview with Walter Cronkite of CBS, international financier Robert Vesco (by then living in exile in Costa Rica, fleeing prosecution in the United States) had some interesting allegations that have hardly ever been noted. The per tinent portion of the transcript of the interview speaks for itself: CRONKITE: Mr. Vesco, you said . . . that six months before the Watergate break - in, the Democrats had come to you with a plan for impeachment of the president. Can you tell us what that pl an was? VESCO: Well, let me just correct you for a moment. I don't think I said that the Democrats came to me. I said a group did. I don't believe I identified who. The plan was essentially as I have stated previously, where they were going to attempt to g et initial indictments of some high officials, using this as a launching board to get public opinion and — in their favor and using the press media to a great degree. The objective was to reverse the outcome of the public [1972 presidential] election. 945 Ve sco said that the \"group\" that he met with included three people whose names were well known and who had served in high posts in past administrations which he did not name. According to Vesco, the plotters had approached him because they believed that he k new about (or otherwise had access to) information regarding a secret cash contribution to the Republican Party that could be used to create a scandal that could be used to bring down the Nixon administration. `THE SAME FORCES' OPPOSED JFK AND NIXON What is even more intriguing, particularly in light of what we will be examining later, is that Vesco also said (following Nixon's resignation in 1974) that \"the forces that threatened me are the same politically that eliminated President Kennedy and then Pres ident Nixon and want to eliminate all of Nixon's associates.\" 946 Although JFK assassination researcher, Carl Oglesby, writing in The Yankee and Cowboy War , comments that Vesco \"garbled it ideologically\" 947 by suggesting that the same forces that eliminat ed JFK were also behind Nixon's removal from office, it seems, instead, that Vesco was quite correct indeed. Because Oglesby never takes into consideration the fact that both the \"liberal Democrat\" (Kennedy) and the \"conservative Republican\" (Nixon) had co me into conflict with Israel and its American lobby and because he is blinded by the \"liberal - conservative\" dichotomy, Oglesby thus fails to understand the big picture. Clearly, as Vesco said, the forces that threatened him were \"the same politically\" that assassinated John F. Kennedy and then moved against Richard Nixon."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"[368] Final Judgment 465 VESCO'S PERMINDEX CONNECTION Vesco is actually a very good source on this little - understood aspect of the \"Dallas - Watergate Connection.\" In fact, Vesco's rise to power in the financial world came when he assumed control of flamboyant financier Bernard Cornfeld's Investors Overseas Service (IOS), 948 which, as we saw in Chapter 7 and in Chapter 15 was an integral part of the Kennedy assassination - linked Permindex network set in place by l ongtime high - level Mossad operative Tibor Rosenbaum. And as we noted in Chapter 9, it was Michael Townley — actually an IOS operative at the time of the JFK assassination — who was later convicted of the murder of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. Townley's c o - conspirators in that crime were Cuban exiles (and CIA assets) Guillermo and Ignacio Novo whom, as we have seen, arrived in Dallas on November 21, 1963 and met with CIA man E. Howard Hunt and evidently played some role along with Hunt in the circumstances surrounding events in Dallas that were linked to the assassination conspiracy. Vesco himself became entangled with Arab interests in the wake of the subsequent IOS financial scandal, so much so that investigative reporter Jim Hougan commented wryly (and w isely) that Vesco \"might easily have convinced the Arabs that IOS was a political instrument of Israel, pointing to multimillion - dollar investments in Israeli bonds and properties, and its links to such noted Zionists as Cornfeld, Rosenbaum, Rothschild . . . \"With some Madison Avenue pros in his corner,\" said Hougan, \"Vesco could have manipulated the nationalist sentiments of the Middle East, emerging in the Arab view as a political refugee, the victim of a sinister Zionist conspiracy. After all, as [Vesco] was fond of pointing out, all his troubles could be traced to 'those fuckin' Jew bastids [sic] at the SEC.' And there would have been some poetic justice in the event had Vesco succeeded with this ploy,\" 949 he added. Thus, in light of Vesco's intimate con nections to the Permindex web behind the JFK assassination conspiracy, it is likely that Vesco indeed knew the facts about Mossad complicity with the CIA in the JFK affair and was thus using his leverage to strike out at those who were attempting to bring him back to the United States for trial. Vesco ultimately took refuge in anti - Zionist Cuba with Fidel Castro's assent and there he undoubtedly gave Castro an earful about what he — Vesco — knew about the JFK affair. This, of course, would have been of special interest to Castro inasmuch as the plotters behind the JFK assassination went to great lengths to \"sheep - dip\" the president's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, as a Castro sympathizer. In the end, of course, Castro ultimately had a falling out with Vesc o and the famed \"fugitive financier\" was imprisoned by his long - time host on charges of involvement in the drug trade."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"466 ”Deep Throat” [369] Vesco's ultimate fate remains to be seen, but there is no question that his allegations that the forces behind Watergate had also been behind the JFK assassination conspiracy have great relevance and credibility, particularly since we do know for a fact that as the Watergate scandal began to unfold, the subject of the Kennedy assassination seemed to preoccupy Richard Nixon. NIXON AND THE JFK ASSASSINATION JFK assassination researchers who have been looking for the much - discussed \"Dallas - Watergate Connection\" often cite the memoirs of Nixon's former White House Chief of Staff, H. R. Haldeman, in which Haldeman described how Nixon sought t o have the CIA intervene to prevent the burgeoning Watergate scandal from going any further. Nixon told Haldeman how he (Haldeman) should approach then - CIA director Richard Helms and convince Helms to cooperate. Nixon advised Haldeman to remind Helms how e x - CIA man E. Howard Hunt was one of the Watergate burglars. \"Hunt ... will uncover a lot of things,\" said Nixon. \"You open that scab there's a hell of a lot of things . . . . tell them we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go an y further. This involves these Cubans, Hunt, and a lot of hanky - panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves.\" 950 Haldeman said that, at the time, he had no idea what \"hanky - panky\" Nixon was talking about. But Nixon continued: \"When you get the CIA peo ple in say, 'Look the problem is that this will open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again. So they should call the FBI in and for the good of the country don't go any further into this case. Period.\" 951 Later, in a subsequent meeting, Nixon again elaborat ed on this cryptic theme saying: \"Tell them that if it gets out, it's going to make the CIA look bad, it's going to make Hunt look bad, and it's likely to blow the whole Bay of Pigs which we think would be very unfortunate for the CIA.\" 952 In fact, Haldem an did go to Helms and passed on this message. The reaction of the CIA director astounded Haldeman who described it in his memoirs: \"Turmoil in the room, Helms gripping the arms of his chair leaning forward and shouting, 'The Bay of Pigs had nothing to do with this. I have no concern about the Bay of Pigs.'\" According to Haldeman: \"I just sat there. I was absolutely shocked by Helms' violent reaction. Again I wondered, what was such dynamite in the Bay of Pigs story?\" 953 (Haldeman' s emphasis). What is inte resting is that Haldeman said that later, after he began putting things together, that he determined that \"it seems that in all of those Nixon references to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually referring to the Kennedy assassination.\" 954 (Shortly before his d eath, and years after the memoirs were published, Haldeman claimed that the co - author of his memoirs, Joe DiMona, inserted"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"[370] Final Judgment 467 the reference regarding the \"Bay of Pigs\" and the Kennedy assassination into his memoirs and that it was published without his know ledge and that it was simply not true. Haldeman failed to explain, however, why he had never read his own memoirs before they were published or why he never repudiated the supposedly spurious — but often noted — claims by his co - author immediately after the bo ok was published.) There were others who also believed that the CIA was a prime mover behind the Watergate scandal. Even the Washington Post (which became the foremost media voice in the Watergate affair) reported: \"Charles W. Colson (a top Nixon adviser) made a startling series of allegations about Nixon's fears of CIA involvement in the Watergate scandal. Colson portrayed the president as a virtual Oval Office captive of suspected high - ranking conspirators in intelligence circles, against whom he dare not act for fear of international and domestic political repercussions. His underlying suspicion was that the CIA planned the break - ins at Watergate. The motive: to discredit the president's inner circle of advisers:' 955 It appears indeed that Nixon was blac kmailing the CIA over its involvement in the JFK assassination and attempted to use this knowledge against the CIA for political leverage after the Watergate affair began to unfold. However, there is a great likelihood that, from the very beginning, the bu ngled \"break - in\" at the Watergate was actually a set - up that was designed to fail. And behind that set - up was the CIA itself. There have been more than a few investigators who have looked into the Watergate affair — including the aforementioned Carl Oglesby — who have concluded that the Watergate burglars were, in fact, infiltrated by a \"double agent\" or agents who deliberately ensured that the Watergate burglars were caught in the act: A piece of masking tape \"accidentally\" left over a door latch — horizontally, rather than vertically, thereby exposing it — alerted Watergate security that shenanigans were afoot. ANGLETON'S BURGLARS? While it has been suggested E. Howard Hunt himself was one of those who helped \"bungle\" the break - in — a view evidently held by G. Gor don L i d d y a n d c e r t a i n l y b y E u g e n i o M a r t i n e z , 9 5 6 t w o o f t h e o t h e r burglars — another likely double agent was James McCord who was directly responsible for the travesty of the tape. Although not known to the public before the Watergate scandal, McCord was not a run - of - the - mill \"CIA agent.\" He had not only been the senior CIA security official in Europe but was also later responsible for security at CIA headquarters at Langley, 957 not insignificant positions by any means. Yet, in ostensible \"retirement\" the CIA' s high - ranking security expert managed to \"bungle\" a two - bit burglary."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"468 ”Deep Throat” [371] McCord himself later said that Nixon tried \"to get political control over the CIA\" 958 and certainly that would not be to McCord' s liking — nor to those in the CIA such as the Mossad' s ally, CIA Counterintelligence chief James Angleton. In fact — and this is very important — McCord was a close friend of Angleton, 959 and in his long - standing capacity as a CIA security official, McCord worked directly with Angleton. What's more, as a Bible - qu oting Christian, McCord shared Angleton's devotion to Israel. Thus, not only does the evidence suggest that the Watergate operation against Nixon was set in motion at least in part because Nixon was (like JFK before him) a threat to Israel, but that Waterg ate's origins can be traced back directly to Angleton's office at the CIA. In addition, the fact that we also find a veteran Mossad asset, CIA contract agent Frank Sturgis, and his old CIA partner E. Howard Hunt, back in the loop in the bungled burglary is also significant indeed. As we shall now see, it was Angleton who orchestrated — through an agent inside the White House — the constant leaks to the Washington Post that led to the nationwide media frenzy remembered today as \"Watergate.\" ENTER 'DEEP THROAT' The White House source who provided young Washington Post reporters Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein the rope they needed to hang Richard Nixon for the Watergate cover - up was dubbed \"Deep Throat.\" For years there has been speculation as to the real iden tity of \"Deep Throat\" and one of the candidates whose name has often been mentioned — although he denies it — is General Alexander Haig who served as White House chief of staff at the time of Nixon's demise.

They speculate that by October of 1973 Haig (himself an ardent defender of Israel) became embittered by President Nixon's anti - Jewish outbursts and even angrier that Nixon had nearly let Israel be victimized by a surprise Arab attack and \"took it with both hands\" 960 and became \"Deep Throat\" for the purpose of doing in Nixon and forcing him out of office. This is an interesting theory, if only because it points to the fact that there are pro - Isra el sources who suggest that the undoing of Richard Nixon was the work of an ardent Zionist highly placed in the White House: in this case, Alexander Haig. However, there is much stronger evidence that suggests that we should lay the wreath of honor at the tomb of James Angleton. If Angleton wasn't \"Deep Throat\" per se, he was certainly the CIA handler for \"Deep Throat\" — and thus was ultimately responsible for the destruction of Richard M. Nixon. So let's take a look at the evidence. We turn to the work of in vestigative journalist Deborah Davis whose hard - hitting book, Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and Her"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"[372] Final Judgment 469 Washington Post Empire, created quite a ruckus when it was first issued. The book was so inflammatory that Mrs. Graham put forth her immense clout and had it pulled from the bookstores and pulped. But what is even more intriguing is the fact that Davis's book has been perhaps the only work (until now) that documented the long - hidden Angleton connection to the Watergate affair (but which has somehow gone un - noticed and forgotten). ANGLETON AND THE WASHINGTON POST Initially, Davis describes the long - standing and intimate connections between Angleton and Benjamin Bradlee, the Washington Post editor who supervised reporters Robert Woodward and Carl Ber nstein in the Post's coverage of the Watergate scandal: \"Nineteen fifty - six. Ben Bradlee, recently remarried, is a European correspondent for Newsweek. He left the [American] embassy [in Paris, where he served as press attaché] for Newsweek in 1953, a year before CIA director Allen Dulles authorized one of his most skilled and fanatical a g e n t s , f o r m e r O S S o p e r a t i v e J a m e s A n g l e t o n , t o s e t u p a counterintelligence staff. As chief of counterintelligence, Angleton has become the liaison for all Allied intellige nce and has been given authority over the sensitive Israel desk, through which the CIA is receiving eighty percent of its information on the KGB. \"Bradlee is in a position to help Angleton with the Israelis in Paris, and they are connected in other ways as well: Bradlees' wife, Tony Pinchot, Vassar '44, and her sister Mary Pinchot Meyer, Vassar '42, are close friends with Cicely d'Autremont, Vassar '44, who married James Angleton when she was a junior, the year he graduated from Harvard Law School and was r ecruited into the OSS by one of his former professors at Yale.\" 961 Davis also cites another Bradlee - Angleton connection that would become critical during the Watergate period: \"Also at Harvard in the early 1940s were Ben Bradlee and a young man, Richard Ob er, who would later become Angleton's primary counterintelligence deputy, and work with the master in Europe and Washington throughout the fifties, sixties and early seventies. \"The Harvard yearbook for 1943 - 44 shows Bradlee and Ober, who are four months a part in age, both to have been in the Hasty Pudding club as lower classmen; it is a four - year club and students join as freshmen. According to a Hasty Pudding club historian, 'the eating clubs at Harvard had only about forty members' then and were often th e source of close, even lifelong friendships among the young men . . . \" 962 Despite all this, Bradlee denied knowing Ober then — or later. But there's no question that by the time Bradlee had begun his work for Newsweek and was collaborating with James Angl eton \"with the Israelis in Paris,\" Ober was Angleton's trusted deputy. And this was during the time"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"470 ”Deep Throat” [373] that Angleton's operations involving the French Corsican Mafia (described in Chapter 9 of Final Judgment ) were at their height. Davis describes the role t hat Bradlee and other journalists tied in to the Angleton network played: \"He and his colleagues are writing from the Cold War point of view. Angleton and Ober are intelligence operatives who travel between Washington and Paris, London, and Rome. In Washin gton, at private places such as Philip and Katharine Graham's salon, these patriots philosophize and make plans; in foreign cities, they do the work of keeping European Communism under control by using whatever means necessary — planting negative stories, in filtrating labor unions, supporting or discrediting political leaders — to provoke anti - Communist sentiment.\" 963 Bradlee also managed to find himself in the thick of the Algerian controversy that, back in the United States, young Sen. John F. Kennedy had emb roiled himself — much to the dismay of Israel's supporters who objected to the concept of Arab Algeria (then still a French colony) of becoming an independent republic. According to Davis, Bradlee's \"most notable feat as a foreign correspondent was to obtain an interview with the FLN, the Algerian guerrillas who were then in revolution against the French government. The interview, which had all the earmarks of an intelligence operation . . . caused the French to expel Bradlee from the country in 1957. \" 964 In any event, remarkably enough, here we find Bradlee — while working with Angleton, some 17 years before Watergate — in the midst of yet another project of special interest to Israel and which would ultimately prove to be part of the so - called \"French Connectio n\" to the JFK assassination conspiracy of which Angleton was a central player. However, just shortly after the JFK assassination itself, we once again find Angleton and Bradlee secretly working together behind the scenes. As we pointed out in Chapter 16, a fter JFK's mistress, Mary Pinchot Meyer (Bradlee's sister - in - law and the wife of high - level CIA official Cord Meyer) was found shot to death (in what was said to be a robbery) on October 12, 1964 Angleton obtained Mrs. Meyer's diary (with Bradlee's help) a nd destroyed it at CIA headquarters. Some years later, after a Washington Post editor, James Truitt, became engaged in a conflict with Bradlee, Truitt went public with the story of Angleton and Bradlee's procurement of Mrs. Meyer's diary. Prior to this tim e Angleton had managed to avoid the spotlight, but his connection to the Mary Meyer intrigue brought him some unwanted public recognition indeed. According to Deborah Davis, \"Truitt' s feud with Bradlee unnecessarily [exposed] Angleton, to his disgust and bitterness.\" 965 By 1967 , with Israel safely assured the all - out support of the Johnson administration, Angleton's office at the CIA was running the now - infamous \"Operation CHAOS\" which was an \"intelligence collection program with definite domestic counter intelligence aspects\" 966 — in short a spying operation aimed at American citizens who dared dissent against CIA and"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"[374] Final Judgment 471 Johnson administration policy. The operation was run for Angleton by his longtime deputy, the aforementioned Richard Ober. However, when Ri chard Nixon came into office in 1969, the Nixon White House began cooperating closely with Angleton's operation and thus brought Ober into the White House inner circle. 967 THE MOSSAD IN THE WHITE HOUSE? There was another added wrinkle, however. This part icular fact — reported by Deborah Davis — has apparently never been mentioned elsewhere in all the wealth of information published in reference to Watergate and the intrigue of that era. Davis's revelation is central to an understanding of the secret forces be hind the coup d'etat that ejected Richard Nixon from the presidency . . . According to Davis, as part of a so - called solution to three problems perceived by Secretary of State Kissinger — namely \"detente, the Arab - Israeli wars, and domestic subversion\" 968 — K issinger actually moved Angleton \"into the White House and put him in charge of an Israeli counterintelligence desk that was in theory independent from and more important than the Israel desk at the CIA.\" 969 Davis notes that \"Angleton worked closely with K issinger and knew almost everything he was doing, although Kissinger did not have the same advantage with Angleton.\" 970 Handling the affairs of Angleton's Israeli desk at the White House — a virtual Mossad outpost — was Angleton's deputy, Richard Ober. Thus, A ngleton and Ober were well - placed at a critical time when Richard Nixon, flush with victory following his triumphant landslide re - election, began moving to assert control over the CIA and against Israel As we have seen, the bungled two - bit Watergate burgla ry of 1972 had already taken place, and Nixon and his inner circle had begun a foolish cover - up attempt. But the evidence suggests that the burglary, from the beginning, was a set up. And Nixon fell right into it. It was James Angleton's longtime ally at t he Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, who began the media push that made \"Watergate\" a household word and led to the series of official inquiries that brought down Nixon. But the Post couldn't have orchestrated the public outrage if it hadn't relied so thorough ly on \"Deep Throat\" — a highly - placed White House insider who was able to provide Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein the information they needed to make Watergate a big, big story. Deborah Davis provides us a summation of the parameters of the in trigue between \"Deep Throat\" and the Washington Post demonstrating, beyond question, that the Post's Watergate coverage was not just a simple case of hard - driving young reporters doing a fantastic job of routing out corruption but that there was much more going on behind the scenes: \"That Woodward was manipulated or 'run,' by Deep Throat is very clear from [Woodward and Bernstein's book on Watergate] All the"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"472 ”Deep Throat” [375] President's Men, which is another reason that the book is an amazing document. It is evident that Deep Throat has a serious interest in the Post's succeeding with its investigation . . . He expects results. He will not tell him how he knows what he knows or why he wants to help Woodward implicate Nixon . . . \" 971 Davis has concluded that the \"voice\" for the source, \"Deep Throat,\" in fact, was James Angleton's deputy, Richard Ober. And this means, of course, that Ober most assuredly was doing Angleton's bidding as part of a campaign to bring down Richard Nixon. The big question, as far as Davis is concern ed, is whether \"Deep Throat\" approached Woodward or whether Woodward's editor, Ben Bradlee, put Woodward in touch with \"Deep Throat.\" In either event, the fine hand of James Angleton was clearly at work. Either Angleton sent Ober to Woodward or Angleton di rected his longtime Post ally, Bradlee, to have his reporter Woodward seek out Ober. Davis points out: \"The minor deception in [All the President's Men] is that only Woodward knew who Deep Throat was. Bradlee too almost certainly knew him and for far longe r than Woodward.\" 972 Davis adds that: \"There is a possibility that Woodward had met [Deep Throat] while working [before he became a Post reporter] as an intelligence liaison between the Pentagon and the White House, where Deep Throat had his office, and th at he considered Woodward trustworthy, or useful, and began talking to him when the time was right.\" \"It is equally likely, though,\" says Davis, \"that Bradlee, who had given Woodward other sources on other stories, put them in touch after Woodward's first day on the story, when Watergate burglar James McCord said at his arraignment hearing that he had once worked for the CIA.\" 973 In Davis's judgment: \"Whether or not Bradlee provided the source, he recognized McCord's statement to the court as highly unusual , CIA employees, when caught in an illegal act, do not admit that they work for the CIA, unless that is part of the plan. McCord had no good reasons to mention the CIA at all, except, apparently, to direct wide attention to the burglary, because he had bee n asked to state only his present occupation, and he had not worked for the CIA for several years.\" 974 A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION Davis's conclusion is quite powerful indeed: \"Whether Deep Throat was Richard Ober, whom Bradlee had dined with at Har vard and whom Woodward very likely had known while at the Pentagon; whether or not it was Ober, who as head of Operation CHAOS, as both a White House and a National Security operative, was one of the few men in a position to know more about Nixon than Nixo n himself did; whether or not Deep Throat was the same man who had been the deputy and the protégé of James Angleton, the CIA's master of dirty tricks — there is no doubt that the use of the"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"[376] Final Judgment 473 Washington Post to take down Nixon was both a counterintelligence operation of the highest order and the dirty trick par excellence.\" 975 \"What matters,\" concludes Davis, quite correctly, \"is not how the connection with Deep Throat was made, but why. Why did Bradlee allow Woodward to rely so heavily upon it, and ultimat ely, why did the leaders of the intelligence community, for whom Deep Throat spoke, want the president of the United States to fall?\" 976 It seems apparent that here, in Final Judgment, we can at last provide an answer to Davis's question as to why the lea ders of the intelligence community, for whom Deep Throat spoke, wanted Richard Nixon out of the presidency. The answer lies in the simple proposition that Nixon — like John F. Kennedy before him — had become perceived (as we have seen) as a threat to Israel's survival. And so it was that the Watergate operation was set in motion to remove Nixon from the White House. Once Nixon and his inner circle were enmeshed in the web and began their often - ridiculous cover - up attempts (which, of course, were their own doing ) they helped set the stage for their own undoing. Nixon, further, began making blackmail attempts against the CIA, clearly threatening the agency — as we have seen — with use of his knowledge of CIA involvement in the JFK assassination. (And considering all e lse we now know, it's likely that Nixon knew of — or suspected — Mossad involvement as well.) Once, however, that the Washington Post — at Angleton's instigation — became actively involved in the campaign against Nixon, the president's fate was sealed. The widely - heralded Senate investigation of the Watergate affair became a daily staple of television coverage and the House of Representatives began proceedings for impeachment. And highly placed in the intrigue against Nixon as the chief counsel to the Senate Waterg ate Committee was Sam Dash, a former national commissioner and member of the national advisory council of the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith 977 — the American intelligence conduit for Israel's Mossad. And serving as the \"Republican\" minority c ounsel — well placed to monitor Nixon's GOP defenders — was Albert Jenner, whom we met in Appendix Four as the former Warren Commission staff member with intimate ties to the mob - linked Chicago empire of Zionist billionaire Henry Crown. We can thus rest assure d that all interested parties were fully versed in the secrets of the Watergate affair and its progress. In short, Nixon was surrounded. His only chance for survival, once Watergate unraveled, would have been a virtual counter - coup. In this regard, we do k now that Israel's other key partisan inside the White House, Alexander Haig, actively moved to prevent Nixon from making any attempts at fighting back. More than one published account has described how Haig actually instructed the armed forces to ignore an y military orders by President Nixon unless they were cleared with him first."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"474 ”Deep Throat” [377] What's more, there have also been reports that Haig himself instituted a quiet, behind - the - scenes investigation of Nixon's reported involvement with organized crime, evidently as part of the effort to further tighten the noose around Nixon's neck in the event that the president refused to go on his own volition. We can only imagine the public response if they learned that their president — who said he wasn't a \"crook\" — would have b een exposed by the Washington Post as a secret ally of \"the Mafia.\" As it was, Angleton, Haig and the Post never had to play their \"Mafia\" card against Nixon. The embattled president resigned on August 9, 1974. THE REAL 'DALLAS - WATERGATE CONNECTION' In t he context of what we have thus considered, can there be any doubt that Watergate, in fact, was a joint CIA - Mossad operation — orchestrated by James Angleton — for the purpose of removing Nixon from the presidency, an operation akin to the conspiracy that led to the assassination of John F. Kennedy? The evidence is there, for those who can see the big picture. It might be added, if only as an afterthought, that it seems that the choice of the moniker \"Deep Throat\" was some sort of \"inside joke\" on the part of W oodward and his colleagues at the Post. Angleton, of course, was known as a heavy drinker and chain smoker who was often enveloped in a haze of smoke. \"Deep Throat\" was also said to be quite literary and it was well known that while at Yale, young James An gleton, in fact, was very much the poet and edited a literary magazine. So the use of the \"Deep Throat\" code name was obviously a not - so - subtle way of signaling to those in the know in official Washington that the real force behind the leak of information to the Post was, in fact, Israel's CIA ally, James Angleton. And thus, anyone in the loop would realize immediately that the \"Watergating\" of Richard Nixon was a dirty tricks operation being conducted out of Angleton's Israeli desk in the White House. Alth ough Richard Ober appears to have been the actual \"voice\" for \"Deep Throat,\" James Angleton was the ventriloquist behind the scenes. Richard Curtiss, executive editor of The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, stated frankly in 1995 that \"it's long b een our opinion that whoever played the role of 'Deep Throat' was in fact only a conduit for information collected by Israel's Mossad and used to discredit Nixon,\" 978 and that Nixon's attempt to reassess U.S. relations with Israel was \"the catalyst that le d directly to his downfall.\" 979 Until the fourth edition of Final Judgment, Richard Nixon's moves to consolidate power and to control the CIA and the subsequent intrigue of Watergate have never been connected to Nixon's emerging conflict with Israel. But there's no question, all things considered, that this is the real key to understanding Watergate and the \"Dallas - Watergate connection\" that has so long been pondered but never fully understood — until now."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"[378] Final Judgment 475 Having been in the center of the political upheava ls that had torn American apart in the decade following the assassination of John F. Kennedy (in which James Angleton too played a part) Angleton, if anybody, was truly \"the man who knew too much.\" No wonder — among other reasons — that William Colby forced An gleton out of the CIA in 1974. Angleton's ouster from the CIA was certainly a setback for Israel and its Mossad at a critical time, but Angleton was old and sickly (perhaps even verging on clinical madness by some less than friendly accounts) and he would have ultimately been forced into retirement for this alone. Angleton, in the end, was an expendable anachronism who, in his heyday, had served his Israeli allies well. THE PLOT TO 'GET' AGNEW There are other indications, too, that the Israeli connection played a significant part in Watergate (and in subsequent related events that followed). The Israeli connection can be traced in scandals that encircled both Vice President Spiro Agnew and former Texas Gov. John Connally, who had joined the Nixon administr ation as Treasury Secretary and who was Nixon's first choice (even over Agnew) as a successor in 1976. Part of the Watergate conspiracy against Nixon — a critical part, in fact — was ensuring that Agnew was first removed from the vice presidency before Nixon w as toppled. And as it so happened, ironically, as Agnew pointed out in his memoir, Go Quietly . . . Or Else, if Nixon had stood firm and backed Agnew when Agnew himself came under fire, Nixon himself may not have been forced to resign. In fact, in Agnew's view, he, Agnew, was even more hated by the powers - that - be than Nixon. However, because President Nixon was already under siege as a consequence of the burgeoning Watergate scandal, he refused to come to Agnew's defense and would not undertake any efforts to quash the investigation of Agnew that ultimately led to Agnew's resignation. In retrospect, there's no question that the scandal that brought down Agnew was as contrived as any in American history. In the midst of the Watergate \"crisis,\" Barnet Skolnik, a liberal Jewish prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland brought bribery charges against Agnew that are — as the evidence shows — suspect to this day. Skolnik got his chance to \"get\" Agnew when Lester Matz, a prominent Jewish businessman who was under investigation for paying kickbacks to public officials in Maryland in return for county and state contracts, dredged up his previous on - again, off - again relationship with Agnew during the vice president's years in Maryland politics. In a deal with Sk olnik, Matz claimed that he had paid bribes to Agnew. Then, following Matz' s lead, two other copy - cats who were also under investigation — I. M. Hammerman and Jerome Wolff — also claimed to have paid off the former Maryland governor."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"476 ”Deep Throat” [379] Agnew admitted that he had often received campaign contributions from corporations that did business with the state — a common practice in Maryland and elsewhere — but insisted that he never accepted any money for personal use. However, the federal prosecutors were eager to build a case against Agnew in order to force him out of the vice presidency.\" 980 AGNEW AND ISRAEL M. Hirsh Goldberg, wrote in the Times of Israel about Agnew's career. In an article entitled \"Jews at the Opening . . . Jews at the Close\" Goldberg said: \"It was a political life curiously intertwined with Jews. The swift rise like a Fourth of July rocket, the sudden fall from political grace — both involved Jews. It was an ironic, almost unnoticed aspect of a political career so much addressed to Middle America . . . and yet so heavily dependent on Jewish brains, Jewish talent, Jewish money and — at the end — so heavily damaged by the testimony of Jews.\" 981 Ultimately, facing a possible jail sentence if he went to trial and was convicted, Agnew resigned the vice presiden cy and pleaded no contest to bribery and tax evasion charges stemming from his purported acceptance of the bribes (which Agnew continued to deny until the day he died). Neither of Agnew's accusers ever spent time in jail. The Republican attorney general wh o promoted the campaign by U.S. Attorney Sachs against Agnew was Elliot Richardson, who ultimately resigned from the Nixon administration \"in disgust\" and was heralded as a \"hero of Watergate.\" In his memoirs Agnew (not insignificantly) points out that Ric hardson wanted someone in the line of presidential succession who \"would defend Israel, whatever the risk to the United States.\" 982 Agnew was already suspected of \"anti - Semitism\" because of his attacks on the media and, as Agnew noted, two years after lea ving office he came under heavy fire \"for saying that our attitude toward Israel was affected by the preponderance of Israel's sympathizers in the big news media.\" 983 After leaving office, Agnew wrote The Canfield Decision , a controversial, though little - r ead novel about high - level political intrigue which some critics called \"anti - Semitic,\" bringing the former vice president back into the headlines once again. Agnew's novel was described by one pro - Israel columnist as suggesting that \"Jews in the media mak e up a 'Zionist lobby' leading us to disaster in the Mideast.\" 984 Later, privately, in an April 20, 1988 letter to his friend, former Rep. Paul Findley (R - Ill.), himself a sharp critic of the Israeli lobby, Agnew commented that \"I trace the advent of my di fficulties to a confrontation with this same lobby.\" 985 But Agnew will be remembered as a \"crook\" who served as Vice President. Not as the victim of Israeli intrigue, as he most certainly was, the naysayers notwithstanding."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"[380] Final Judgment 477 THE ASSASSINATION OF JOHN CON NALLY In the meantime, John Connally, like Agnew, was also indicted for bribery under circumstances which suggest another calculated \"frame - up.\" One Jake Jacobson, a lobbyist for the milk industry, claimed that Connally, a multi - millionaire, had accepted a $10,000 bribe (while serving as Treasury Secretary) in return for helping secure a 1971 increase in government milk price supports. However, the fact is that in his capacity as treasury secretary Connally had no official powers in regulating the Departme nt of Agriculture's milk price support programs. Connally's accuser Jacobson had previously been indicted by the Justice Department for misappropriation of funds involving nearly $1 million in loans from a Texas savings and loan — but when Justice Department lawyers learned of his past association with Connally, Jacobson suddenly remembered the \"bribe\" he purportedly had given to Connally and entered into a plea bargain. In order to avoid going to jail himself, Jacobson became the \"star witness\" against Conna lly. Connally was acquitted, but his 1976 White House ambitions were shattered, even though the evidence against him had been brought by an unsavory felon who was angling for a reduced sentence in an unrelated criminal case. As in the Agnew case, however, the media gave full play to the charges against Connally and helped further the perception that Nixon and his intimate associates were engaged in widespread criminal conduct. In fact, most of Nixon's key lieutenants, with the notable exception of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig and legal adviser Leonard Garment — pro - Israel partisans — ultimately went to jail. But although some anti - Semites said that Jacobson (who was Jewish) was part of a \"Jewish plot\" to \"get\" John Connally, the fact is that the outspoken Texan did ultimately, in fact, fall victim to a very real \"Jewish plot\" that prevented him from achieving the presidency. In 1979 when Connally launched a well - financed bid for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, he publicly challenged the power of the Israeli lobby in a highly controversial speech that, by all accounts, led to the end of Connally's presidential ambitions once and for all. But what is interesting is that Conally' s speech was considered so inflammator y by the Israelis and their Americans supporters that a prominent Israeli educator and philosopher, Emmanuel Rackman, president of Bal Ilan University, actually called for Connally's assassination. Comparing Connally to Haman, the ancient enemy of the Jewi sh people, Rackman — a rabbi — issued his call for Connally's assassination in the November 18, 1979 issue of The Jewish Week - American Examiner , the publication of the Israeli - government owned Jewish Telegraph Agency, a subdivision of the worldwide Jewish Agen cy. Rackman's vicious attack on Connally was headlined: \"John Connally Campaign Seen as Dire Threat to Israel and U.S. Jewry.\" Rackman quoted"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"478 ”Deep Th roat” [381] New York Times columnist William Safire as having said that for \"the first time, a candidate for President has d elivered a major address which he knew would disturb and dismay every American supporter of Israel.\" 986 Rackman commented: \"This is true. But does not this observation signify more than it says? Does it not mean that in Connally we have, for the first time , a candidate who in no uncertain terms is telling the American people that he does not want the support of Jews and that he wants to prove that one can be elected president without Jewish support. \"Furthermore, does it not mean that at long last we have a candidate who hopes to get elected by mobilizing support from all who share his total disregard of how Jews feel about him and is this not an invitation to all anti - Semites to rally behind him? I am generally not an alarmist but nothing in American politi cs in recent years so disturbed me as Connally's subtle communication to Jews that they can `go to the devil.' Even the Nixon tapes were not so upsetting. \"The American Jewish community must be alerted. If only we had stopped Hitler early enough, millions of Jews would still be alive. And Connally must be stopped at all costs. He must not even get near the nomination! He must be destroyed, at least politically, as soon as possible. It is sufficiently early to make Connally look ridiculous and destroy him po litically without bloodshed. \"Perhaps I am overreacting,\" said Rackman. \"But if I have learned anything especially from the rabbinic view of Biblical history it is that we are less fearful and more forgiving of enemies who at least accord us a modicum of r espect than we are of enemies who treat us with disdain, with contempt. That makes Arafat more acceptable than Connally.\" 987 Rackman compared Connally with Amalek, another foe of the Jewish people: \"'Remember Amalek,' we are told. 'Don't forget.' Eradicat e him from the face of the earth. Simply because Amalek had no respect for us. He encountered us in his path and casually sought to exterminate us as vermin. It is my fervent prayer,\" said this Jewish religious leader, \"that American Jewry will not minimiz e the importance of the challenge they have been given and will act speedily and with devastating effectiveness.\" 988 John Connally was not eradicated as Rackman urged. But his political career came to a halt after the major media began a campaign against h im. However, when John Connally died in 1993, the doctors said that Connally's fatal lung condition was a direct outgrowth of the chest wounds that he had received in the shooting in Dallas on November 22, 1963. So ultimately, in the end, John Connally did prove to be yet another victim of Israel — as much as if he had died on the same day as John F. Kennedy. YET ANOTHER ASSASSINATION . . .

There was yet another media - orchestrated political assassination — with covert intelligenc e connections — that has its"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"[382] Final Judgment 479 own link (however indirect) to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. We refer to the debacle that led to the withdrawal of Colorado Sen. Gary Hart from the race for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. As a member of th e Senate, the maverick Hart had been in the forefront of inquiries not only into the JFK assassination, but also into the intrigue of the CIA in general, including its involvement with the Lansky Syndicate and the Mafia in assassination attempts against Fi del Castro. Needless to say, this did not win Hart many friends in certain circles. Even Tampa Mafia boss, Santo Trafficante (Meyer Lansky' s devoted lieutenant) was once heard to say of Hart: \"We need to get rid of the son of a bitch.\" 989 In fact, someon e did get rid of Hart. His affair with a young woman, Donna Rice, was bared by the press, forcing Hart out of the race for the presidency. However, there was much more at work behind the scenes as former National Security Council staffer Roger Morris has p ointed out: \"Though it came too late to affect his fate, there would be still more evidence that Hart's fall was not what it seemed at the time . . . Some of those involved in Hart's Miami - Bimini weekend turned out to have links to organized crime and coca ine trafficking and, in spiraling circles beyond, to crime bosses of the Jewish and Italian syndicates, who in turn possessed ties to the U.S. intelligence community dating back to the Bay of Pigs and earlier.

TWO PRESIDENTS, TWO COUPS — SAME PLOTTERS What we have seen here does indeed spell out the \"Dallas - Watergate Connection\" as it has never been outlined before, placed on the record in its complete context for the first tim e. Watergate — like the Kennedy assassination — was a coup d'etat conducted by traitors within the American government who were under the discipline of the same foreign influence. It is no coincidence that two key CIA players in Watergate, James Angleton and F rank Sturgis (both with long - standing Mossad loyalties) — not to mention E. Howard Hunt — once again are central to the scenario. Two different American presidents from two different political parties were brought to heel by Israel and the results of two elec tions were thus negated.

They were essentially the first books that were published on the subject of the assassination. Then, as time went by there were a number of books that were overviews of the theories about the assassination that had been emerging, encompassing critiques of the forensic evidence, autopsy informa tion, etc.   With the advent of Jim Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw there were a number of books written exclusively about that subject and this opened up a whole new realm in the arena of the JFK inquiry — which, in my view, is a key period of transition in JFK research.   Following that, there were a number of interesting volumes appeared that were actually novels — fiction. Although they were novels they were important because some of them contain grains of truth. I think these novels are important because t hey do give you an overview of various perspectives relating to the assassination.   There have also been a number of volumes that have laid forth various possible conspiracies that resulted in the assassination — volumes that are akin to the approach taken in my own book in the sense that they deal with the power politics involved.   Then there are the more \"offbeat\" books that have been published by various witnesses or studies that delve into areas that are unique to those volumes.   There are also several books by authors who have written on various aspects of the case and, I want to focus quite specifically on those authors and what they have written, most notably the widely - promoted Case Closed, by the now - infamous Gerald Posner. Mr. Posner, of course, has eme rged as the media's number one hatchet man who is called into action for the debunking and smearing of all serious JFK assassination researchers — including yours truly. However, Posner is a remarkable case study in himself, as we'll see. So let's examine so me of these books . . ."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"[ 384] Final Judgment 481 THE 'OFFICIAL' HISTORY For those who want to have a good perspective on the \"official\" history of the JFK assassination — conspiracy theories notwithstanding — they should first read the books, The Death of a President, by William Manchester, and The Day Kennedy Was Shot, by Jim Bishop. Although both authors accept the basic conclusions of the Warren Commission, the volumes do provide a good historical background and overview of the assassination and the immediate events that follow ed. It's important for people to read these books to become familiar with the subject. It wouldn't hurt to even read the Warren Commission Report or the hard - to - find multiple volumes of exhibits that were issued along with the report. MARK LANE Obviously , Rush to Judgment, by Mark Lane, was the first major book to expose the Warren Report's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone assassin for the outrageous fraud that it was. And although the book is now nearly 30 years old, it still remains the single bo ok that anyone must read if they wish to understand why people began to doubt the Warren Report. This book sparked the explosion of research into the JFK assassination that led, in the end, to my own writing of Final Judgment. It was, after all, Rush to Ju dgment, that led Jim Garrison into his monumental investigation that I believe that came as close to anything in revealing the truth about the JFK assassination. Mark Lane also wrote a book called A Citizen's Dissent that appeared in 1975 — several years aft er Rush to Judgment — but unfortunately this volume is not one that many people are familiar with. I've told Mark myself that I think this book is even better than Rush to Judgment, for several reasons. First of all, because it came out later and incorporate s many of Mark's new findings in the wake of Rush to Judgment. Secondly, and more importantly, it's highly significant in that in this second book Mark delves into the aspect of how the media treated his inquiries into the JFK assassination and how the FBI and the CIA and the rest of the Establishment responded. Although the book is hard to find, I would suggest that anyone who wants a startling perspective on how the government responded to what Mark called \"a citizen's dissent\" read this volume. Mark Lane 's final volume on the JFK assassination, Plausible Denial, which I've already discussed at length in these pages, represents in many ways Mark's own unique long - term perspective and sets the stage, I believe, for Final Judgment. In many ways, Final Judgme nt is perhaps a sequel to Plausible Denial — or so it has been suggested."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"482 The Battle of the Books [385] [385] AN OVERVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE Accessories After the Fact by Sylvia Meagher is, in some ways, a supplement to Rush to Judgment. This is a highly detailed examination of the Warren Repo rt that is a valuable exposition of all the flaws in the case against Lee Harvey Oswald. This book will interest those who are fascinated by ballistics, autopsy evidence, etc. Six Seconds in Dallas by Josiah Thompson is a real tour de force. This book is a fantastic analysis of the Zapruder film. Profusely illustrated, this volume establishes that there were several assassins in Dealey Plaza beyond any question and that the official autopsy evidence doesn't jibe with the truth. This is a classic book. Those interested in the photographic evidence should refer to Robert Groden's The Killing of a President. James Fetzer's Assassination Science is the latest look at the scientific evidence. (Fetzer by the way, refuses to acknowledge he knows anything about Fina l Judgment although I sent him a copy and wrote him twice!) In the area of books that consider the JFK assassination from a larger overview, Crossfire, by Jim Marrs is probably the best. This book is flawed largely because Marrs presents multiple theories, one on top of the other, and does not really reach any firm conclusions. Those who think that they will find the solution to the assassination in the book, more than likely, will find themselves overwhelmed by the multiple theories. Marrs never firmly est ablishes in the reader's mind that there can be multiple interests working together to achieve the same goal. He seems to treat the assassination in the context that either A did it or B did it or C did it, never really suggesting a combination of elements were responsible. Who Shot JFK? by Bob Callahan is an easy to read guide, broken down into many interesting sidebars and delightfully illustrated with wonderful cartoons that present a satirical touch to a very ponderous subject. Conspiracy by Anthony Sum mers is an interesting treatment of the JFK controversy up to and including the House Assassinations Committee investigation in the late 1970's. My primary complaint against Summers is that in his revised edition he fails to acknowledge the information tha t he was provided by Gary Wean, the former Los Angeles detective who knew about the Mickey Cohen - Israeli connection to JFK's famous affair with Marilyn Monroe (and which I, of course, examine in Final Judgment). Now Summers himself had also written a book on the life of Marilyn Monroe (where he does mention Wean) but he leaves the reader with the idea that the Kennedy family had a hand in her death, whether by accident or by murder. Be that as it may, Summers' book is quite interesting. In his revised editi on Summers also falls flat by failing to give the French Connection, which he mentions, the analysis it is certainly due. Reasonable Doubt by Henry Hurt is another good overview. It has its flaws but nothing substantial. It's probably worthwhile reading fo r serious researchers. Likewise with Robert Sam Anson's They've Killed the President which is an interesting book. But I hasten to add that I find Anson's attack on Jim Garrison off the mark and reprehensible."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"[386] Final Judgment 483 Even after the release of Oliver Stone's JFK , Anson went to work and published attacks on Garrison and other JFK assassination researchers. In one published article Anson claimed that in his own book Garrison never mentioned that he (Garrison) had been indicted on corruption and tax evasion charges. In fact Garrison has a whole chapter on this in his book and this leads me to believe that Anson hadn't read the book. JFK: The Facts & the Theories by Carl Oglesby is quite good, but my own problem with Oglesby is that although he acknowledges the Permin dex Connection he falls into that peculiar trap of suggesting that Permindex is some sort of \"Nazi Connection\" to the JFK assassination when, as we've seen, nothing could be further from the truth. Other than that the book is worth reading for a good overv iew. Crime & Cover - Up: The Dallas - Watergate Connection by Peter Dale Scott, a slim monograph on the subject, is fascinating. It examines the special interest groups in Washington that were opposed to JFK and their ties to Organized Crime and the intelligen ce community. Needless to say, however, Scott doesn't get into the Israeli Connection. Likewise with Scott's equally fascinating, far lengthier, and more recent Deep Politics and The Death of JFK. This book is severely flawed in that just when one thinks t hat Scott is about to get into the Israeli Connection (whether through his discussion of Organized Crime or through the CIA), Scott very carefully tiptoes away. Scott's research is deficient in that despite the depth and breadth of his work he never gets i nto the Garrison investigation whatsoever. There I believe is another very serious flaw. One never knows precisely who Scott suspects of responsibility for the assassination. As I have said, Scott says very much, but at the same time, says very little. Non etheless his writings are well worth your while. THE 'FICTIONAL' APPROACH At this juncture I'd like to discuss several of the novels that have appeared over the years dealing with the JFK assassination. The most notable is Executive Action by Mark Lane a nd Donald Freed which actually appeared in the wake of the film by the same name. (Mark Lane was the prime mover behind the film, but in the end was disappointed with the final product). This book demonstrates how high - level power brokers could have orches trated the assassination. Robert Morrow's novel, Betrayal, is similar in many ways to Executive Action. It is presented as a novelized treatment of Morrow's own purported experiences as a CIA contract operative who became unwittingly enmeshed in the JFK as sassination conspiracy. Morrow indicts Clay Shaw as one of the conspirators – perhaps the primary conspirator — and paints him as some sort of \"rogue\" CIA agent operating without official sanction of the CIA. In subsequent years Morrow issued a revised edition of this book in a non fiction format and I will discuss that later."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"484 The Battle of the Books [387] Richard Condon's Winter Kills, a loosely - disguised treatment of the JFK assassination, is a satire but people may find it interesting. I think it's interesting in that it provides a goo d overview of the intrigue in a Kennedy - like family and their inter - play with the American Establishment. (This book was later made into a Hollywood film, available on videotape.) Promises to Keep by George Bernau — another novel — paints a Kennedy - like presid ent actually surviving the assassination attempt and shows the post - attempt intrigue involving some very recognizable characters. It concludes by explaining how the assassination attempt came about. It's only a novel, of course, but it's interesting. Libra by Don DeLillo has Lee Harvey Oswald as its main character and shows how Oswald may have been manipulated into the assassination conspiracy by CIA - connected plotters. This rather surreal volume might even contain a few nuggets of truth. There's a characte r in the book who is a CIA operative along the lines of the real - life E. Howard Hunt and this character is portrayed setting up a \"dummy\" assassination attempt that others turn into the real thing. (As I say in Final Judgment, I think this is probably alon g the lines of what may have happened.) American Tabloid by James Elliott presents the interplay between Organized Crime, Jimmy Hoffa, the FBI and the Kennedy family and ends with the JFK assassination. Quite a good read, this book is interesting in that i t sets the tone for what undoubtedly was a lot of the inter - play between these real - life figures who appear as characters in the book. There may be a few \"fictitious\" elements that are really not far off the mark. STUDIES OF THE GARRISON CASE The books t hat have appeared on the Jim Garrison - Clay Shaw case are in a category of their own and are important. The first major book on this was Paris Flammonde's The Kennedy Conspiracy. This is a very hard - to - find volume that is a classic on the subject. The book contains much on Shaw's Permindex Connection (and this may be one reason why the book has never been reprinted, if I may digress into paranoid conspiratorial thinking for a moment.). Although the book was published before the Shaw trial was finished, it co ntains much valuable material and is interesting reading. I should point out that although Flammonde does mention Permindex, he does not draw the Israeli Connection out as he could have done and should have done. But that's only a minor flaw in a wonderful book that should be \"must\" reading for all JFK assassination researchers. James Kirkwood's American Grotesque is fiercely critical of Garrison. Kirkwood was a major Shaw booster, but the book contains a lot of material taken directly from the Shaw trial i tself and contains a lot of detail about many of the interesting people who appeared in the course of the Garrison investigation. Frankly, every time I re - read the book I continue to be amazed that the author couldn't see how much evidence there really was against Shaw and it's evidence that Kirkwood actually presents in his book."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"[388] Final Judgment 485 One other book on the Garrison investigation of Clay Shaw is Edward Jay Epstein's Counterplot. It's an all - out attack on Garrison — a slender volume that I wouldn't mention if it otherwise weren't for the fact that it was Epstein who wrote the book. This is significant, as I have noted in Final Judgment, in that Epstein was a close associate of CIA man James Angleton and it was also Epstein who also wrote the one book Legend (a bio graphy of Lee Harvey Oswald) that most closely reflects Angleton's own JFK cover story: that ultimately the Soviet KGB was behind the assassination of President Kennedy, whether by accident or by design. Epstein suggests that Oswald had been co - opted by th e KGB and that he committed the crime acting alone – with or without the orders of his KGB superiors. That book received wide play in the Establishment media. Interestingly, Epstein also wrote the book Inquest that was hailed by the media as an important cri tique of the Warren Commission Report. However, I've always felt that this volume was an Establishment \"cover story\" suggesting that while there were problems with the way the Warren Commission conducted its investigation, there was nothing to worry about in the end. In any case, none of Epstein's books are of any real value. Jim Garrison himself wrote his own account of his investigation. Entitled On the Trail of the Assassins, it's an interesting and well - written book. I would suggest, however, that the book is somewhat of a disappointment in that it is more a free - flowing personal memoir on the case, rather than a detailed account of the investigation that many would have found far more enlightening. The most recent study focusing on the Garrison investi gation is James DiEugenio's Destiny Betrayed. This is an important book in that it examines much of the evidence in the Garrison investigation (more so even than Garrison's own book) and essentially proves that Garrison was right when he targeted Clay Shaw for involvement in the JFK assassination conspiracy. We don't know precisely what role Shaw played in the conspiracy, but DiEugenio demonstrates beyond question that he was mixed up somewhere in the middle of it. There are some problems with the book. I f ind DiEugenio's hero worship of JFK a little overwhelming. One would think that JFK was almost a God. Because DiEugenio seems to betray a somewhat naive pro - Kennedy bias, coming from a liberal perspective, DiEugenio falls into the trap of perceiving and po rtraying Clay Shaw as being \"right wing.\" As I told DiEugenio in correspondence, his book fails in that he does not pursue Shaw's Permindex Connection to its ultimate Israeli Connection. There might be an explanation for this. The book was published under the auspices of the Sheridan Square Press (which, incidentally, also published Garrison's book) which is affiliated with the Institute for Media Analysis. This institute, as we already noted in Appendix Three, receives money from the Stern Family Fund. Thi s foundation is the creation of the Stern family of New Orleans who were not only Clay Shaw's close friends, but also leading backers of the"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"486 The Battle of the Books [389] Anti - Defamation League (ADL) office in New Orleans that was tied to Guy Banister. They also owned WDSU radio and t elevision that helped portray Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" Those are the major books on the Garrison case. Had Garrison's inquiry not been sabotaged so repeatedly and relentlessly, it may have ultimately unearthed the truth about the JFK a ssassination long before Final Judgment was ever released. I strongly suggest that people focus, focus, focus on the Garrison investigation. By getting to the bottom of what Clay Shaw and Guy Banister and David Ferrie were up to in New Orleans involving Le e Harvey Oswald we will be able to come a little bit closer to knowing more of the truth about the JFK assassination. THE 'OFFBEAT' VOLUMES The next series of books in JFK assassination lore are the ones that might be described, for want of a better term , as those of an \"offbeat\" nature. There are many such volumes, but I want to focus on a handful. One that comes immediately to mind is The Assassination Tapes by former CIA analyst George O'Toole. The book describes O'Toole's use of voice stress analysis to determine whether key witnesses in the JFK case (whose voices were taped at one time or another) lied. He concludes that Oswald did not lie when he denied having killed the president and also that some of the Dallas police officers on the case may not h ave been telling the truth either. As a former CIA man, O'Toole has a certain bias in that he seems to suggest that the FBI might have been somehow culpable in the JFK assassination cover - up (which few frankly doubt), but all in all the book is worth readi ng and people will find it entertaining. David Lifton's much - discussed Best Evidence contends that there were post - death alterations made of President Kennedy's wounds even prior to the official autopsy back in Washington. This book is a ponderous volume a nd quite detailed but I must say that it is so overwhelming that one becomes lost. Much of the technical evidence is beyond the comprehension of the average reader and because of that, I'm afraid, the book doesn't make a major contribution other than to co nfuse the JFK assassination controversy even further. A very particularly interesting first - hand account is Flashback by Ron Lewis. A man with a rather checkered background, Lewis was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald through Guy Banister's CIA contract op eration in New Orleans. A few people question Lewis's credentials, but his book does provide an account of Oswald's association with Banister from a unique first - hand perspective. I couldn't find anything in Lewis' book that conflicted in any way with my o wn findings in Final Judgment regarding the strange activities conducted out of Banister's office. It's a hard - to - find book, but one worth reading. Another little - known volume that's quite unique is The Second Plot by an English writer, Matthew Smith, who portrays Lee Harvey Oswald as a"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"[390] Final Judgment 487 patriotic intelligence operative who stumbled across a plot to kill JFK and sought to expose the plot. Quite an interesting book. Dr. Charles Crenshaw's JFK: Conspiracy of Silence presents a first - hand account of what the doctor saw in the emergency room in Dallas and shows the \"official\" JFK autopsy reports to be garbage. Crenshaw took a lot of heat for daring to come forth with his knowledge and he deserves quite a bit of credit for having done so. WAS IT REALLY A 'MORTA L ERROR'? Another book that I must mention (because I have been asked about the book on more than one occasion) is Mortal Error by Bonar Menninger. This book contends that the fatal shot that killed the president was accidentally fired by a Secret Service agent in the follow - up car behind the JFK limousine. I have read the book and I will say right up front that it is not akin to the outlandish, nonsensical story (believed with religious fervor by some) that JFK was killed (deliberately) by a shot fired by his Secret Service chauffeur. Instead, Menninger's book is well - written and thoroughly - researched. Anyone who read the book (and who had absolutely no other knowledge about the JFK assassination whatsoever) might conclude that this was indeed the \"final j udgment.\" The thesis of the book is that somebody (probably Lee Harvey Oswald) was firing at JFK with criminal intent from the Texas School Book Depository, but that a Secret Service agent's weapon went off and finished the incompetent Oswald's job. There is at least one problem with this thesis: it's not likely that Oswald fired a gun in Dealey Plaza that day and there is also legitimate debate as to whether any shots were actually fired from the window where Oswald allegedly fired. But if, per little chan ce, the thesis was right, it doesn't essentially conflict with the overall general thesis of Final Judgment, inasmuch as Final Judgment does contend that Oswald was in the midst of circles within circles who were conspiring against the president and trying to frame Oswald to make it appear as if he did fire from the book depository. If indeed a shot was accidentally fired at JFK by the Secret Service, it doesn't remove the fact that shot was fired in response to an assassination attempt from elsewhere. With all of this said, I have to suggest that no matter how sincere the authors of the volume, the book is a wild distraction for serious students of the JFK conspiracy. It's quite an inventive theory, but I don't think it has much credibility, to be perfectly honest. There's one more volume that I should mention. That is Kill Zone by Craig Roberts. Although the book is a standard recounting of the basic facts about the broad - ranging nature of the conspiracy against JFK, touching on the standard players such as the CIA and the Mafia and even gets into the so - called \"French\" connection (without going so far as to make the definite Israeli linkage), the book is interesting and refreshing in that the author is not fearful of bringing up the possibility that there w ere high - level"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"488 The Battle of the Books [391] international influences at work in the JFK assassination. I am referring specifically to Roberts' discussion of the power bloc known as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the plutocratic international money forces that control the CFR. I don't think that you can find any proof that the CFR initiated the JFK assassination (nor, for that matter, does the author bring up any such proof) but I do have to give credit where credit is due: this is, after all, one of the first JFK books th at has the guts to suggest that there could indeed be high - level groups of this nature, functioning in the world today, above and beyond the CIA. This is taking so - called \"conspiracy theory\" to its utmost, for there is nothing more unfashionable than to ta lk about secret groups such as the CFR. To even talk about the CFR and other such groups linked to the international financial Establishment, these days, is to invite the charge of \"anti - Semitism.\" So this is unique in JFK research and may open up a few ey es. So, essentially, in my view, this volume evidences a new widening of horizons in JFK research. FLETCHER PROUTY Let's now take a look at the non - fiction works of Col. L. Fletcher Prouty, former liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA during the Kenne dy years. Prouty, of course, was the model for the character \"Man X\" in Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Prouty's book The Secret Team , although not about the JFK assassination per se is a study of worldwide power politics as they have been affected by the intrig ues of the CIA. The subtitle of his book is quite descriptive: \"The CIA and its Allies in Control of the United States and the World.\" Prouty's book is a study of the origins, growth, development and excesses of the CIA. Unfortunately, I might note, when i t comes to discussing the CIA's \"allies\" Prouty does not delve into the Mossad arena. Otherwise it's a very important book and the CIA did its best to keep the book under wraps. Prouty's other book, JFK (ponderously subtitled \"The CIA, Vietnam and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy\") is equally interesting. The title itself is somewhat misleading as even Colonel Prouty himself has said, noting that it was his publisher who insisted on the title. Instead, the book focuses on the role of the United State s in Indochina and the behind - the - scenes maneuvering in the years leading up to American involvement in that tragedy. The book is important in that it demonstrates conclusively that President Kennedy did want to get out of Indochina and that he faced the o pposition of power forces — both domestic and international — and this was one of the key considerations by the CIA in its decision to participate in the JFK assassination conspiracy. JFK's M IDDLE EAST P OLICY"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"[392] Final Judgment 489 Those interested in JFK's Middle East policy I wo uld refer to those volumes cited in Final Judgment, in particular, Stephen Green's Taking Sides, Andrew and Leslie Cockburns' Dangerous Liaisons, and Seymour Hersh's The Samson Option. I hasten to add that none of these volumes suggests any tie - in between JFK's conflicts with Israel and his assassination. Once one has studied these volumes, there can be no question in mind that the popular perception of JFK being a \"friend\" of Israel — at least in the mind of the Israeli leadership at the time — is far from bei ng on the mark. And that's an understatement. There's no question but that by the time of his death JFK was considered by the Israeli leadership to be a threat to Israel's continued survival. Anyone who has any ambitions of being an authority on the assass ination of JFK can not — I repeat, can not — examine the assassination without reading these books that touch on this aspect of JFK's foreign policy. Those who avoid the subject are obviously afraid of getting dirtied up in the Israeli Connection. 'THE MAFIA KILLED JFK' Although the books that suggest that \"T he Mafia Killed JFK\" constitute a subject category all of their own, I won't devote any further discussion to those volumes in this bibliographical historical overview of the books on the assassination. I 've already discussed these volumes and their highly flawed thesis at various junctures throughout the pages of Final Judgment. These volumes have, nonetheless, received widespread coverage in the Establishment media because, I'm certain, it takes the focu s off the real conspirators. But rest assured: the Mafia did NOT kill JFK. ROBERT MORROW At this point I want to discuss the works of Robert Morrow. Earlier I mentioned his novel, Betrayal. His \"non - fiction\" revised edition of this book, substantially e nhanced and enriched, is First - Hand Knowledge, subtitled \"How I Participated in the CIA - Mafia Murder of President Kennedy.\" It's an interesting book but I am cautious about the volume if only for the reason that, as I pointed out in Final Judgment, it was printed by an American affiliate of an Israeli publishing concern. Aside from that I will say that in my opinion there is no question that Morrow himself was involved with people who were involved in the intrigue surrounding the assassination, in particula r with those CIA elements that were collaborating with the anti - Castro Cuban exiles. However, as I've suggested, my own view is that the Cuban aspect of the assassination conspiracy has been over - played by most researchers. That is, in the sense that I don 't actually see the Cuban exiles as being real conspirators, but, instead, \"facilitators\" — even patsies — who were being manipulated as much as Lee Harvey Oswald."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"490 The Battle of the Books [393] The primary role that I see the Cubans playing in the conspiracy was having helped lay the gro undwork for the cover - story that the hapless Oswald was a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" The Cubans — both the pro - and anti - Castro Cubans — were, in my view, little more than additional \"false flags\" planted in the midst of the assassination conspiracy landscape by t hose ultimately responsible for the crime. In Final Judgment I relied heavily on Morrow's book, The Senator Must Die, for information on the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. This book suggests that the Iranian secret police, SAVAK, carried out R FK's murder on contract from the CIA. I haven't seen any evidence anywhere to indicate that Morrow might not be in part correct on this, and in Final Judgment I have noted that SAVAK was a joint creation of the Mossad and the CIA. There had long been a clo se covert relationship between the Mossad and the CIA and the Iranians, although many people have been unaware of this fact. So if RFK was killed by SAVAK as Morrow says, that to me suggests that we should look further into an Israeli connection there, alt hough Morrow, of course, doesn't get into that. I do have to say that I do have some doubts about Morrow's overall reliability in the sense that it is sometimes very difficult to determine what is indeed his own first - hand knowledge or what is his opinion or what others have told him. Morrow's books are interesting and provide many fascinating leads. There's no doubt about it. However, I am deeply concerned that Morrow seems to suggest that James Angleton of the CIA was somehow out of the loop as far as the JFK assassination and cover - up was concerned — and nothing could be further from the truth. The fact that Morrow was a CIA contract operative moving in some rather unsavory circles is another factor to consider in all of this. People in such a position don' t always know who they really are working for. Sometimes they think they are working for one purpose when, in fact, they are working for another purpose. And they don't always know all of the facts. So Morrow's own experiences (and his account of his exper iences) have inevitably been colored by all of this. I'm not suggesting that Morrow was a dupe or a patsy, but I suggest that we should look at his first hand account with caution. A note of interest: I have been reliably informed that Morrow is familiar w ith the thesis presented in Final Judgment and by this time he may well have read the book. He has yet to contact me however. HUGH McDONALD In Final Judgment I have discussed the books Appointment in Dallas and the follow - up work, LBJ & the JFK Conspirac y, both by Hugh McDonald, another former contract operative for both the FBI and the CIA. I've pointed out that I don't find either of these works particularly credible. The first volume was co - authored by Geoffrey Bocca, a former propagandist"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"[394] Final Judgment 491 for the Is raeli - backed French OAS and needless to say, in light of everything I've already discussed, that in itself gives one reason to question the book's reliability. The second book, co - written by Robin Moore, who's long had ties with the intelligence community, parrots the James Angleton line that the Soviets were behind the JFK assassination. The book also says that the KGB manipulated Lyndon Johnson into covering up the Soviet connection. So much for McDonald's volumes. The only reason I mention them here is b ecause people continue to ask me to comment on their contents. THE FANTASIES OF HARRISON LIVINGSTONE At this point we must assume a heavy burden by examining four unusual books written by one unusual man: Harrison Livingstone. The books are High Treason, High Treason 11, Killing the Truth and Killing Kennedy — all published by Carroll & Graf. I would have to say that the third title is a pretty apt summary of what all four volumes really do. As a writer myself, I hate to be critical of the writing styles of other authors. I've been critical of the motivations of other writers in the JFK field, recognizing that they have axes to grind and that they have special interests behind them promoting their efforts for often less than noble causes. In the case of Harr ison Livingstone, however, I am amazed that his books were ever published in the first place. This is perhaps more a reflection upon his publisher than upon Livingstone himself. These four volumes are bizarre, to say the very least. The second and third vo lumes, in particular, appear that they've had no editing whatsoever. One gets the impression that the publishers gave Livingstone free rein to rant and rave and wander from subject to subject without any restraint of any kind. At times Livingstone's commen ts appear to border on libel. He lashes out at his own critics in a highly personal fashion and suggests that he is the one and only author who has written anything on the JFK assassination worth reading. He shifts back and forth between analyzing autopsy evidence, photographic evidence and eye - witness accounts and although it doesn't appear that Livingstone has any formal training in any of the fields he discusses with such self - righteous authority and indignation, Livingstone would have you believe that a nyone who disagrees with his interpretations is, at best, a liar, and, at worst, a deliberate participant in the assassination cover - up itself! His co - author on the first edition of High Treason, Robert Groden, a highly respected JFK researcher, is also su bjected to savage attacks by Livingstone in the subsequent volumes. I'm surprised Groden hasn't sued for libel. There are special smears for Mark Lane. Livingstone actually says that because Lane had a \"left wing\" reputation that he had no business getting involved in researching the facts about the JFK assassination. That, according to Livingstone, made it appear that only \"left - wingers\" were interested in the assassination and that average Americans were not. Livingstone also actually scoffs at the idea t hat the CIA was involved in the assassination. He also contends that because Lane represented Liberty Lobby"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"492 The Battle of the Books [395] in the E. Howard Hunt libel case that — get this — Lane may have been helping cover - up for so - called Texas oil barons who were involved in the assassi nation and who, Livingstone contends are the financial backers of Liberty Lobby. (Which, I hasten to add, is just not true, Livingstone's delirious rantings notwithstanding.) These mammoth volumes contribute absolutely nothing to JFK assassination research , yet a major publisher has picked up these volumes, printed them and given them widespread distribution. Two of the volumes even made the New York Times best - seller lists! Livingstone has alienated all the major JFK assassination researchers with his biza rre behavior and yet, for some reason, his books have been given this undue distribution. I have to think that there is an agenda behind the widespread distribution of Livingstone's nonsense: to muddy the waters further and to present Livingstone's rather unusual persona to the general public as the definition of what a \"best - selling JFK researcher\" happens to be. I have to point out that Livingstone even suggests that perhaps Abraham Zapruder, who filmed the famous 8 mm motion picture of the assassination, was somehow a part of the conspiracy, placed on the scene to provide a record of the assassination for the conspirators! However, there is emerging evidence that the Zapruder film itself has been doctored. Now as I say the only reason that I have even spe nt this much time discussing the books by Livingstone is that I am disturbed that they have gotten the widespread distribution that they have. I bear Livingstone no ill will and I emphasize that I don't doubt his personal sincerity, but I question the moti vations and the wisdom of his publisher. THE CASE OF GERALD POSNER The case of Gerald Posner is one that deserves special analysis, to say the least. Although the media widely hailed Gerald Posner's Case Closed as \"the last word\" on the JFK assassination conspiracy, the fact is that the book would be more accurately described, in many ways as \"the first word.\" I personally discovered more than a handful of blatant contradictions and distortions appearing in the pages of the book after only a cursory revie w. Then, upon actually reading the book, I realized that it was little more than a rehash of the Warren Commission Report's biographical overview of the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. So with Case Closed we have indeed come full circle with this much - touted bo ok being hardly more than an up - dated reaffirmation of \"the first word\" — the Warren Report — coupled with fierce and malicious personal attacks on JFK assassination researchers and witnesses whose views run contrary to the Warren Commission. There are lots of criticisms of Case Closed by many, many people, but I'll outline just a few of my own random comments based upon my own review of the book. Had I spent more time reviewing Posner's volume, I'm sure I could have found many more contradictions, but those th at I cite here, I think, are highly representative of his highly misleading work."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"[396] Final Judgment 493 POSNER'S CONTRADICTIONS   Throughout the book Posner will cite conclusions by the House Select Committee on Assassinations that agree with his thesis that Oswald carried out the crime alone. However, when a finding by the HSCA doesn't jibe with Posner, he dismisses the HSCA out of hand. Then, although Posner actively seeks to discredit JFK assassination researcher Anthony Summers throughout the book, he cites Summers as a sou rce (on page 144, for example) by quoting Summers to the effect that Jim Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was \"extremely weak.\" In other words, Summers is an unreliable source when Summers' conclusions point toward a conspiracy, but when Summers' own conc lusions about some matter even vaguely agree with Posner's, Posner finds Summers worth citing to back up his own views.   Posner cites a witness named Jack Tatum who reportedly saw Oswald leave the scene of the murder of Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit, s tating that Tatum \"told his story for the first time to investigators for the House Select Committee on Assassinations.\" This is interesting because in other instances when other witnesses who contradict Posner's thesis had not come forth and told their st ories initially, Posner questions their reliability. However, when a late - coming witness, such as this one, seems to confirm Posner's thesis, he cites such a witness as being reliable and \"proof' of his (Posner's) correctness. POSNER'S NAME - CALLING   Posne r's primary talent is ad homenim attacks on witnesses whose testimony does not jibe with his conclusions, which are, of course, nothing more than the same conclusions reached by the Warren Commission some thirty years before. For example, Posner calls one witness \"an admitted drunk\" (suggesting, I suppose, that drunks are constitutionally incapable of ever telling the truth about anything). But that's only one example of many.   In an attempt to discredit Delphine Roberts, who was the secretary and mistress o f CIA contract operative Guy Banister, Posner attacks some of her rather exotic political and religious beliefs — which have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that Mrs. Roberts claims that Lee Harvey Oswald had a close association with Banist er and his activities.   When Posner approaches the allegations about Oswald's CIA connections made by well - known former CIA contract operative Gerry Patrick Hemming, Posner calls Hemming a \"self - promoter\" who has provided \"outlandish and unproven 'disclosur es'\" about the JFK assassination. Again, more name calling.   When Posner seeks to discredit Mrs. Jean Hill's claim that she was intimidated and bullied by Warren Commission counsel Arlen Specter, Posner says that \"there is nothing remotely approaching such conduct by Specter in the stenographer's verbatim transcription of the deposition.\""},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"494 The Battle of the Books [397] However, Posner never tells his readers that Mrs. Hill has repeatedly and consistently said that the transcription of the deposition was inaccurate and a distortion of wh at she actually told Specter to begin with. What's more, obviously, it seems unlikely that Specter would have permitted his own threatening remarks to become a part of the record anyway. But this is another primary example of how Posner plays fast and loos e with the facts.   In another instance Posner seeks to discredit one of Jim Garrison's witnesses who says that he contacted the FBI about Oswald (after the assassination) to report on an apparent visit by Oswald (prior to the assassination) to Clinton, Loui siana. According to Posner, however, \"there is no record of such a call.\" This, of course, suggests that the FBI was totally above - board in the JFK assassination inquiry and kept records of all matters relating to Oswald and the JFK assassination conspirac y — which we know is not the truth. But Posner accepts the FBI's word on the matter and as far as Posner is concerned, that's that.   Then, although throughout his book Posner has attempted to analyze and psychoanalyze comments made at one time or another by L ee Harvey Oswald, Posner never once comments upon — or otherwise mentions the fact — that Oswald also said he was a \"patsy.\" Posner would have us believe that Oswald had just achieved the greatest accomplishment of his pathetic life and now had nothing to say about that fact.   When attempting to dismiss the possibility that Oswald was a CIA operative, Posner relies on the CIA's own repudiation of a claim by a former CIA employee that Oswald was indeed on the CIA's payroll. (Sure, Gerald, the CIA will be the firs t to admit it!)   Posner says on page 49, on the one hand, that the KGB had no interest in Oswald and then, ten pages later, on page 59 he says that as many as twenty KGB agents were keeping an eye on Oswald. (Make up your mind!) POSNER'S DISTORTIONS OF TRU TH   In his appendix on many of the mysterious deaths surrounding the JFK assassination, Posner commits a number of outrages against the truth. Now needless to say, many of the so - called \"mysterious deaths\" are not so mysterious at all. I personally believe that many JFK assassination researchers have gone overboard in linking a number of such deaths to the conspiracy. But in the case of Posner there are at least two glaring instances where, again, Posner plays fast and loose with the facts. (1) In reference to the death of Maurice Gatlin, Posner states simply that Gatlin died from \"injuries from a fall.\" In fact, Gatlin died after he fell from a hotel window — perhaps after having been pushed, of course. But Posner never mentions the circumstances. Posner also comments that Gatlin's name \"is probably on the list because he was once hired by Guy Banister for an unconnected investigation.\" Posner does not mention that Gatlin was allegedly the courier who carried several hundred thousands dollars in cash to Europe that was earmarked for the Israeli - linked French"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"[398] Final Judgment 495 OAS plotters who were also conspiring against the life of French President Charles DeGaulle. Interesting indeed, to say the least. (2) Another mysterious death that Posner attempts to suggest was not so m ysterious and probably un - connected in any way to the assassination is the death by electrocution of Thomas Eli Davis III. Posner says that Davis was a gun - runner who \"also knew Ruby\" and suggests that there is nothing to actually link him to the JFK consp iracy. Posner does not mention that Davis ran guns to the French OAS and had been picked up in North Africa just prior to the JFK assassination, at which time he was initially reported to have had on his person letters making reference to Lee Harvey Oswald . (It should be noted that it has since been established that the papers found on Davis were letters of introduction to Victor Oswald, an arms dealer based in Spain. Still, however, Posner is not telling the whole story.) POSNER'S BIGGEST FRAUD Perhaps P osner's most egregious assault on his readers, actively aided and abetted by his Establishment media promoters, is his claim to have solved the JFK mystery through the presumably indisputable magic of computers. In his book Posner relies heavily on a compu ter - generated analysis of the JFK assassination by a company known as Failure Analysis Associates, which \"proves\" that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Posner essentially leaves his readers to believe that the computer analysis was somehow prepared exclusive ly for his use, when, in fact, it was prepared for a mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by the American Bar Association (which, incidentally, ended in a hung jury). What's more, Posner also fails to tell his readers that the computer company also pr epared an alternative computer - generated analysis of the assassination which provided a completely different alternative thesis: that there could have been more than one assassin involved in the murder of President Kennedy. So the primary selling point of Posner's book — the famous computer analysis of the assassination — that the media gave such coverage is itself based upon distortions of the truth as they appeared in the pages of Posner's book. There's one other interesting item worth reiterating. As I point ed out earlier in Final Judgment, one of Posner's collaborators, Johann Rush, who provided Posner an \"enhanced\" version of the famous Zapruder film of the assassination, also just happens to be the same Johann Rush who was one of the cameramen for WDSU tel evision in New Orleans (owned by the ADL - and Clay Shaw - linked Stern family) that always seemed to be on hand when Lee Harvey Oswald was making \"pro - Castro\" pronouncements. Rush is always \"on assignment,\" it seems. So much for Gerald Posner. No one really takes his book seriously, not even, I suppose, his sponsors behind the scenes. They do know who killed JFK, but they don't want you to know and that's why they have people like Posner ready to pull out of a hat."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"496 The Battle of the Books [399] SEYM OUR HERSH Forget about who killed Joh n F. Kennedy and why. Instead, you should focus on JFK's personal peccadilloes. That's the message being put forth by the controlled media in this country in the wake of the release of Seymour Hersh's new book, The Dark Side of Camelot. Those who haven't h eard about Hersh's book attacking the character of John F. Kennedy, were not reading the mainstream press at the time of the 34th anniversary of the JFK assassination. The book was being promoted everywhere — including a cover story on the November 17 issue of Time magazine. The reviews — and even the article in Time — unanimously suggested there are questions about Hersh's credibility, but even these reviews had the impact of putting out so many \"negatives\" about JFK that readers almost automatically assume that \"where's there's smoke, there's fire.\" What really is so new about Hersh's book? Nothing, actually. Dozens — perhaps hundreds — of other books have talked about Kennedy family links to the mob, JFK's womanizing, etc. Time itself points out (quite correctly) t hat since the 1970's there have been a vast number of books doing what Hersh's book does: \"debunking JFK.\" So why then the push to take another look at JFK's misdeeds? We all have heard about the Kennedy family's antics — the subject of endless media coverag e for nearly thirty years. It's been that way ever since Mark Lane started asking questions about who really killed John F. Kennedy and why. Lane's book, Rush to Judgment, opened up some real problems for the people who orchestrated the JFK assassination a nd cover - up. The response by the \"big media\" has been to try to say, \"Well, John F. Kennedy wasn't really such a good guy after all.\" (Suggesting that maybe he deserved to be shot, or, at the least, that he set the stage for his own demise.) And then when in Plausible Denial Lane documented the CIA's link to the assassination, the powers - that - be determined that conspiracy theories about the assassination had to be contained. Those theories that are \"acceptable\" say that \"the Mafia did it\" and place blame on long - dead mobsters. Time magazine, which is promoting the new \"debunking\" of JFK, is owned by the mega - rich Bronfman family. And, of course, as documented in Final Judgment, a henchman of the Bronfman family, Louis M. Bloomfield, was a key player in the J FK assassination conspiracy. What about Hersh? It was Hersh's book, The Samson Option, which first exposed that JFK had been engaged in a long - hidden behind - the - scenes war with Israel's Prime Minister, David Ben - Gurion, over Israel's effort to b u i l d a n u c l e a r b o m b . F i n a l J u d g m e n t c i t e s H e r s h ' s w o r k extensively — much to the dismay of those who want to keep Israel's war with JFK a deep dark secret from the admirers of President Kennedy. But here's something very interesting: The November 1997 issue of Vanity F air magazine revealed that Hersh worked closely with Michael Ewing, who was involved in the 1978 House Assassinations Committee investigation into the president's murder. As noted here in Final Judgment,"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"[400] Final Judgment 497 Ewing cited the unusual \"French connection\" to the JFK assassination that was under investigation when the House Committee closed up shop. Final Judgment demonstrates the \"French connection\" is, in reality, the Israeli connection. So surely Hersh was tuned in by Ewing to this \"French Connection.\" And in l ight of what Hersh clearly knew about JFK and Israel, it's obvious he could not have helped but had some inkling of the Israeli connection. Certainly, of course, Hersh knew that Israel had a motive. According to Vanity Fair, Hersh dropped his own research into a book on the JFK assassination and shifted his focus to JFK's personal shenanigans. This apparently happened, after Final Judgment came out in January of 1994 so it appears as if Final Judgment stole Hersh's thunder. Hersh now says he never found any evidence that there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. All he can find evidence for is the fact that JFK had a very interesting personal life and that JFK was supposedly engaged in assassination plots against others. However, there are those w ho dispute Hersh's \"evidence\" as even Time admitted. Is Hersh's book his way of making amends for having exposed startling never - before - known facts about JFK's secret war with Israel — evidence that led to the writing of Final Judgment? And is the media's fo cus on Hersh's credibility actually a subtle way of debunking Hersh's previous writing about JFK and Israel — thereby indirectly discrediting Final Judgment? Whatever the case, Hersh's new book is regurgitating ancient allegations about Kennedy, putting them into circulation once again. That's why those who were behind the assassination are thrilled to give Hersh's book all the free publicity it's receiving. MAKE YOUR OWN FINAL JUDGMENT This has been an extended summary of my own personal reactions and opin ions regarding books about the JFK assassination. If you haven't read the books that I've recommended, I suggest you do so. Once you've read all of these books, I think you can make your own final judgment — and I don't think you'll find that my own general conclusions are off base at all. For those who are interesting in writing their own books on the JFK assassination, I would urge them to avoid the distractions, the nonsensical areas that bog down otherwise serious research. And don't try to write yet anot her overview of the assassination conspiracy. That's what I did, but I added a new angle that had never been considered before. I think that in the pages of Final Judgment I've laid the groundwork for extensive research in a number of new areas that are li ttle - explored or have otherwise never been explored. That's what I encourage people to do. Find some new area of interest related to the JFK assassination and explore it in every way possible. There's much more that can be done."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Appendix Nine Quid Pro Qu o? The Peking Connection to the JFK Assassination Conspiracy — Israel's Secret Nuclear Alliance With Communist China. Not only U.S. policy toward Israel reversed upon JFK's assassination. Although it's virtually forgotten, John F. Kennedy was planning a mi litary assault on Red China's nuclear weapons development facilities in the months prior to his assassination. However, one month after JFK's death, Lyndon Johnson canceled the project and allowed China to proceed with the assembly of its nuclear arsenal. The big secret is that at the time of JFK's assassination, Israel's Mossad and Red China's intelligence service were working behind the scenes on joint nuclear weapons development. The evidence suggests that \"the China card\" played a critical (secret) fact or in Israel's participation in the JFK assassination conspiracy. In early November of 1997, while preparing the fourth edition of Final Judgment, I discovered (quite unexpectedly) an item buried amidst a stack of old news clippings about the JFK assassin ation. It was a 1970 column by veteran Washington pundit, Paul Scott, in which he pointed out that just prior to his assassination, John Kennedy was planning a military attack on Red China's nuclear weapons development program. What's more, according to Sc ott, one month after JFK's assassination, his successor, President Johnson, ordered the impending attack halted. I found it interesting, indeed, that JFK was not only working to thwart Israel's nuclear bomb program (as I had documented in Final Judgment) b ut that he was also taking active steps to thwart Red China's as well. Knowing that — today — Israel is the probably the biggest supplier of arms to China, I began researching a whole new subject area of which I had never been aware: the secret relationship be tween Israel and Red China. I wondered if there might not be some sort of \"Red Chinese Connection\" to the Mossad's role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Then, after only brief research — in the right places — I did find such a connection. It surprised even me. I think the readers will also be intrigued and will agree that what is outlined here points further toward a Mossad role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Shortly thereafter, I learned that a group of JFK researchers were looking into the subject o f \"China and the JFK Assassination.\" However, since that time I have yet to see anywhere — other than in the pages of Final Judgment — any mention of the Mossad connection to the \"China card\" in the JFK assassination conspiracy. This doesn't surprise me, of co urse, but it is a tragedy that even \"truth seekers\" refuse to look the evidence in the face."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"[402] Final Judgment 499 As the readers of Final Judgment will most assuredly see, you cannot take a serious look at the subject of \"China and the JFK Assassination\" in its entirety with out also delving into the Israeli connection. And so it is with virtually all of the key points in the wide variety of areas related to research into the JFK assassination conspiracy. ISRAEL AND RED CHINA: THE NUCLEAR CONNECTION What, then, is the conne ction? The facts are that in 1963 Red China and Israel were secretly engaged in back - channel joint nuclear weapons development. And what's more, the key figure in the joint Red Chinese - Israeli dealings was none other than the late Shaul Eisenberg, longtime business partner of Mossad arms procurement and finance officer, Tibor Rosenbaum, the driving force behind the Permindex corporation that was central to the JFK assassination conspiracy. So although it is now apparently \"acceptable\" in JFK assassination r esearch circles to suggest that JFK may have been assassinated because he was standing in the way of Red China's nuclear bomb development program, it is still considered \"outlandish\" (and \"anti - Semitic\") to suggest that JFK's secret war with Israel over Is rael's nuclear bomb program played a part in leading to his assassination. But the facts are there for those who are interested in finding them — as I have done. Let us then take a look at the Peking connection to the JFK assassination conspiracy. Like the \" French Connection,\" this \"Chinese Connection\" is, in reality, a guidepost pointing to the Israeli connection. JFK'S PLAN TO ATTACK CHINA Let us begin by reviewing what well - connected \"conservative\" columnist Paul Scott wrote on February 13, 1970 — just ove r six years after the Kennedy assassination. According to Scott: \"[Secretary of State Dean] Rusk played a key role in the canceling of contingency planning for the destruction of Communist China's nuclear plants ordered by the late President Kennedy. Autho rized by Kennedy approximately 10 weeks before his assassination, the contingency planning was abruptly called off by President Johnson shortly after he took office. \"While the White House records reveal Kennedy's role in starting the planning to 'take out ' China's nuclear capability, there are no official papers to show why the top secret project was stopped in December, 1963 — or about a month after Kennedy's death. \"In researching the China policy of the Kennedy and Johnson Administration, high - ranking Nix on administration officials have been able to learn only that the project was officially disbanded after Rusk briefed President Johnson on the project when he became President."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"500 Quid Pro Quo? [403] \"The information that Rusk recommended the project be killed comes from an of ficial within the Central Intelligence Agency who was assigned to help draft the plans. He states that the contingency planning group was told that Rusk was against the project from the time Kennedy first initiated it in September, 1963 . . . \"The great si gnificance that Kennedy attached to the highly secret project was indicated by an account of how it started written by Stewart Alsop following Kennedy's death. 'Shortly before he died,' Alsop related, `President Kennedy called one of the government's leadi ng experts on the Far East into his office for a talk. \" ' The conversation concerned a subject which . . . troubled the late President more deeply than any other — the developing Chinese nuclear capability. He asked if there was any chance for ' accommodation ' with the Chinese communists. When the Far East expert said no, the President appeared to agree. He asked the expert what should be done. \" ' I've given a lot of thought to that question, ' the expert replied. ' It should be technically possible at this stage in their nuclear development to destroy the Chinese nuclear plants in such a way that it will seem an atomic accident. The thing could be done as a surgical operation, without nuclear weapons, using high explosives, ' the official continued. ' We could have plans for you, with various operational means for taking out the plants in the near future. ' The official told Alsop that Kennedy pointed at him meaningfully and said, 'You do that. '\" \"Immediately following this White House meeting, a contingency plannin g group was organized within the Kennedy administration to undertake the super - secret project. At their first meeting, the group was told that President Kennedy had decided in principle that China must be prevented, by whatever means, from becoming a nucle ar power. \"According to one of the group, the planning went ahead without a hitch during September, October, and November of 1963 . . . White House records show that shortly after Kennedy's death, President Johnson was briefed about the project by Rusk. It was shortly after this briefing that the project was canceled.\" 991 JFK assassination researcher Dick Russell, who has written in passing of JFK's plans regarding China's nuclear facilities, reports that \"the Soviets were said to be privately urging the U nited States to go ahead with the proposed attack.\" 992 Among those Americans urging Johnson to go ahead with the attack and to stand in the way of China's nuclear development was CIA Director John McCone. According to Seymour Hersh, writing in The Samson Option (his study of Israel's secret nuclear development program): \"McCone sorely felt the loss of John Kennedy; his relationship with Lyndon Johnson was much less intimate and his advice not always welcome. \"McCone's solution to the Chinese bomb . . . was to send in the Air Force. 'McCone just raised hell' about the Chinese bomb, recalled [his"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"[404] Final Judgment 501 long - time aide] Walt Elder. 'He wanted permission to fly U - 2s over the test site and was turned down.' The CIA director wasn't daunted; he next floated 'the idea o f what if we got in and took out the Chinese capability.' One thought was to use unmarked bombers to strike at the Chinese, thus avoiding identification.\" 993 However, as we have seen, President Johnson rejected the plan — and the advice from both the Soviet s and McCone. As a consequence of Johnson's decision not to act, on October 18, 1964, less than a year after JFK's assassination, China exploded its first nuclear bomb. It is more than of passing interest to note that CIA Director McCone who was, according to Hersh, \"committed to the concept of nuclear non - proliferation,\" 994 and urging the attack on the Chinese nuclear facilities, was also one of the primary forces encouraging JFK to oppose Israel's nuclear proliferation. As we saw in Chapter 5, it was out of McCone's office at the CIA that the Kennedy administration conducted its secret surveillance of Israel's nuclear bomb production program. Kennedy clearly trusted longtime Kennedy family friend McCone — but not the CIA as an institution — to handle this deli cate, top - secret intelligence operation. JFK was probably aware that, as we noted in Chapter 8, Israel's loyalist at the CIA, James Angleton, had been providing Israel with secret nuclear information in the late 1950s well before JFK himself came into offi ce. What is even more of interest, however, is that JFK' s ally McCone had been fighting Israel's nuclear bomb program even before he accepted the post of CIA director in the Kennedy administration after JFK fired CIA Director Allen Dulles in 1961 followin g the Bay of Pigs disaster. During the previous Eisenhower administration, McCone had served on the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and in 1960, when Eisenhower's term was coming to a close and McCone turned in his resignation from the AEC, it was McCone wh o first leaked the story to reporter John Finney that Israel was building a nuclear reactor to produce plutonium. 995 The highly controversial revelation was published on the front page of the New York Times on December 19, 1960. 996 According to Finney, \"M cCone was mad, sputtering mad,\" 997 at Israel, saying \"They lied to us.\" 998 According to McCone's long - time aide Walt Elder, \"He figured, 'I'm through [at the AEC] and this is my duty — to let the public know about this.\" 999 Another issue, according to Eld er, was what Hersh described as \"McCone's frustration at the constant Israeli lying\" 1 000 about their nuclear development program. But McCone, evidently, was more than just frustrated. According to Elder: \"There was an impetus to do them in.\" 1001 Strong wo rds indeed: \"an impetus to do them in.\" One can only imagine the response of the hard - nosed Israelis and their allies in Washington to learn of McCone's opposition. And when McCone later went on to serve as JFK's CIA Director and was placed in charge of mo nitoring Israel' s nuclear"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"502 Quid Pro Quo? [405] development, we can certainly understand why Israel would indeed consider JFK to be a danger to Israel's very survival. A frustrated McCone resigned as CIA director in the Johnson administration in 1965, explaining to a colleag ue, \"When I cannot get the President to read my reports, then it's time to go.\" 1002 According to Seymour Hersh, McCone \"also understood what Israel's continuing refusal to permit full - fledged international inspections of its nuclear program] meant.\" 1003 Th at is, that everything that he (McCone) and John F. Kennedy had done to prevent Israel from building the nuclear bomb had failed and that Israel was moving right along in its determined program to do so. What's more, McCone also obviously had good reason t o be disturbed about China's nuclear success, in spite of his previous determined efforts (endorsed by JFK and rejected by LBJ) to block China from securing nuclear weapons capability. CHINA'S NUCLEAR DEBUT — ALSO ISRAEL'S? It is at this juncture that we w ill now turn to \"the Israeli connection\" to Red China and we will discover that there is much more to the picture than we might at first realize. In fact, a good argument can be made that it was Israel — working behind the scenes — that enabled China (already in the process of developing its bomb) to launch its first successful nuclear test. Ultimately, if the truth ever comes out, we will probably discover that China's first nuclear blast was, in reality, a joint Israeli - Red Chinese accomplishment. For the mom ent, of course, that's pure speculation. But facts in the record do point us toward this conclusion. Seymour Hersh himself points out that China's first nuclear test caught the West by surprise. He writes: \"The American nuclear community already had been r ocked in October 1964 upon learning that China's first nuclear bomb had been triggered by uranium, and not plutonium, as the CIA and other intelligence agencies had widely anticipated.\" 1004 What Hersh adds further is especially interesting: \"There was imme diate suspicion that China had somehow bought on the black market — or stolen — the enriched uranium for its bomb (the CIA would not learn for another year or so that China had completed a huge diffusion plant much earlier than expected).\" 1005 In short, Red C hina had moved much further along in its nuclear expansion project than had ever been suspected. China was getting some help somewhere. This, of course, was at the same time that Israel was moving steadily along in its own nuclear development program. In t he meantime — and in the decades which followed — a strange little spy story involving an American nuclear company was evolving. In his book, The Samson Option, Hersh examined the Byzantine tale of the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC), based in Apollo, Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh)."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"[406] Final Judgment 503 NUMEC was owned and operated by an American Jew, Zalman Shapiro, with close and long - standing ties to Israel, and in 1965 an audit of NUMEC by the Atomic Energy Commission discovered large amounts of enriched u ranium had appeared to have \"disappeared\" from NUMEC's inventory during several preceding years. The immediate suspicion — or so the story goes — was that Shapiro had used NUMEC' s resources and diverted the enriched uranium to Israel. Over the following years the NUMEC story became a minor cause celebre among investigative reporters and within the intelligence community, and ultimately the story managed — on numerous occasions — to \"leak\" into the major media in the United States and around the globe. But here's t he catch: Seymour Hersh has concluded that there's no firm evidence whatsoever to conclude that Shapiro and NUMEC were, in fact, responsible for diverting the nuclear resources to Israel. Neither Shapiro nor his company were ever found guilty of anything. However, to this day, there are those who continue to insist (and who evidently believe) that NUMEC was a primary source for enriched uranium necessary for Israel's nuclear bomb. Yet, as we've noted, there's no real evidence for this conclusion, however ex citing it may be. In short, it appears — although Hersh never says this himself — the whole NUMEC story appears to have been a carefully crafted diversion that was deliberately leaked to provide a cover for the genuine source of Israel's ultimate nuclear succe ss. Some critics of Israel (always eager to find Israeli espionage at work) jumped on the story and gave it further widespread distribution and at least one CIA official staked his reputation on the story. But there was never — at least according to Hersh — an y real basis for the accusations that had been made. THE BIG (UNANSWERED) QUESTION . . . So that leaves us with the big question: where did Israel get the resources necessary to achieve its nuclear bomb production capability? As we shall see, publicly av ailable facts (if assembled and examined in their contextual entirety) do indeed suggest that it was through highly - secretive cooperation with Red China that Israel succeeded in its long - time goal of building the nuclear bomb. It is our contention here, in the pages of Final Judgment, that it was, in fact, this joint collaboration between Israel and Red China that played a part in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the consequences which followed: the achievement of nuclear capability for both Israel and Red China. With all of this in mind, let's look at the evidence. From a historical standpoint, China — perhaps alone among many nations — was one of the few where the Jewish people were able to thrive and prosper. Anti - Semitism was never a factor. Referenc e to any standard history will confirm that not only was there a small (but freely flourishing)"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"504 Quid Pro Quo? [407] Jewish community in China for centuries, but, in more recent years — prior to World War II — many European Jews sought refuge in China in the aftermath of Hitler' s rise to power in Germany and his expansion of German military might throughout Europe. Jewish writer, S. M. Perlmann, writing in his History of the Jews in China, summarizes it well: \"To be fair with this old and cultured Chinese nation, [it must be said ] that Jews in China have never had to complain about intolerance; they were never under exceptional laws; they were never persecuted or despised because of their religion. They always enjoyed the same rights as the Chinese people.\"' 1006 BEN - GURION'S DRE AM . . . It is thus no wonder then that upon the founding of the state of Israel, David Ben - Gurion, the grand old man of Zionism, was eager to establish relations with the newly - established communist government in Peking — then still consolidating its power after the struggles of the post - World War II period. According to Israeli writer Uri Dan, it was \"the dream\" 1007 of Israel's founding father, David Ben - Gurion, to forge ties with the Chinese and to \"bring two of the world's most ancient peoples together.\" ' 1008 According to Ben - Gurion's biographer, Dan Kurzman, Ben - Gurion, \"defying American pressure\" 1009 had recognized the new communist regime, but it was \"a heavy blow\" 1010 when Peking did not recognize Israel in return. Ben - Gurion, notes Kurzman, had \" delved into Chinese history and culture and even studied Buddhist thought. China, he was convinced, would inevitably evolve into the greatest power on earth, and its support would be invaluable. The Chinese leaders were militant Communists, yes, but the be st way to moderate them, Ben - Gurion felt, was to talk and trade with them, not force them into snarling isolation. David Hacohen, the Israeli envoy to Burma, had actually met in Rangoon with Chinese Premier Chou En - lai, who hinted at diplomatic and economi c ties.\" 1011 Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi, an Israeli historian who has examined Israel's ties with the Third World notes that: \"The government of Israel, then just nineteen months old, was among the first to recognize the People's Republic of China. In Janua ry 1950 Israel was still on speaking terms with the Soviet Union, and nominally nonaligned. As the decade wore on, it was the Chinese who became interested in developing relations. \"By that time, however,\" says Beit - Hallahmi, \"Israeli had clearly joined th e U.S. camp. Chinese overtures seeking official diplomatic relations were rebuffed in 1954 and again in 1955; Israel clearly did not want to flout the wishes of the United States.\" 1012 Although the Chinese had, by 1955, aligned themselves with Arab leader Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, 1013 and still never publicly recognized"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"[408] Final Judgment 505 Israel, there were many unseen forces at work behind the scenes. In fact, Israel's Mossad and the Red Chinese intelligence service were engaged in quiet diplomacy at the highest (and m ost intimate) levels. Although the world was led to believe well into the late 1970's that Red China was actively supporting the Palestinian cause in opposition to Israel, noted intelligence historian Richard Deacon revealed in 1977 that: \"Early reports of Chinese involvement in the Palestinian guerrilla movements can now be rejected almost totally. They probably arose originally because China was the first major nation to grant diplomatic recognition to Al Fatah and to have provided training for Palestinia n guerrillas at the Nanking Military Academy.\" 1014 However, Deacon cautioned: \"Newspaper and radio reports of Chinese infiltration of the Palestine guerrilla movement have not only been grossly exaggerated, but in many cases just not true, even though ori ginally China as well as Russia established close relations with Al Fatah. It must be remembered that China also has a great interest in Middle East oil and that she is anxious to counteract Soviet interest in this part of the world.\" 1015 \"The truth behind all these scares of Chinese intervention against Israel on the guerrilla front was very different,\" Deacon reported. \"The Chinese had learned their lesson as a result of their openly aggressive and somewhat clumsy efforts at espionage in Africa in the ear ly sixties . . . [when] the Chinese suffered one setback after another in Africa from trying to compete too soon and too speedily with Russian infiltration.\" 1016 \"Whatever may be their public utterances on the subject of the Middle East,\" wrote Deacon, \"th e Chinese privately acknowledge that Israel is in effect an ally in all matters relating to the Soviet Union.\" 1017 Deacon adds: \"The private face of Chinese Intelligence is often totally different from the propagandist public voice of the Chinese Governmen t. Partly because of setbacks in Africa, but also because there have been throughout history close links between the Chinese and the Jews (a number of Intelligence advisers and officers to earlier Chinese governments have been Jews), China' s attitude to t he Arab - Israeli confrontation [was increasingly] somewhat ambiguous.\" 1018 THE SECRET NUCLEAR ALLIANCE It is to Deacon whom we owe the credit for the not insignificant revelation that Israel and Red China were long engaged in secret, behind - the - scenes nu clear development programs. According to Deacon: \"The Israelis have also adopted a technique similar to that of the Chinese in obtaining nuclear secrets and keeping up - to - date on what is developing in that field outside their country: they have made a poin t of carefully recruiting the help of non - Israeli Jews all over the world who are either scientists or students in nuclear physics, while at the same time"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"506 Quid Pro Quo?

Israel's ability to produce such a weapon,\" Deacon added, writing in 1977, \"is now undoubted.\" 1019 In fact, as Deacon pointed out, nuclear bomb production has indeed been a major part of the covert relationship between Israel and Red China, conducted through their respective intelligence agencies — although this is a criti cal point that has otherwise been carefully suppressed. According to Deacon: \"[Nuclear bomb production] has been one of the spheres in which the Israelis and the Chinese have actually helped one another — not officially, but discreetly through Secret Service channels. The `third party intermediaries' involved in such deals have sometimes been non - Israeli Jews working for the Chinese and occasionally even Albanians.\"' 1020 What Deacon pointed out further is of equal significance: \"This is a subject rarely touc hed upon by any writers on Middle East affairs, but such closely guarded contacts as the two Secret Services maintain have bonuses to both sides. On balance the Chinese may have gained most from these relatively low - key and cautious exchanges.\" 1021 This covert nuclear relationship between Red China and Israel was one that cemented the ties between the two nations, so much so that they increasingly began cooperating in other spheres — and gradually moving toward open acknowledgment of their long - standing beh ind - the - scenes contacts through their two intelligence agencies. CHINESE INTRIGUE FOR ISRAEL It was following Israel's role in the conspiracy that removed John F. Kennedy from the presidency and saved China's nuclear bomb development facilities from dest ruction by American forces, that the Chinese actually began engaging in intrigue against their former Arab ally, Nasser of Egypt. According to Deacon, writing of the Chinese: \"In 1965 they were foolish enough to allow themselves to be implicated in an Arab Communist plot to assassinate [Nasser] and the Chinese Ambassador had to leave the country after the Egyptian police found links between the plotters and the head of the New China News Agency who was reported to have helped finance the coup. \" 1022 Deacon noted that, \"The Israelis have always been quick to note dissensions in the Arab ranks and the Mossad has more than once exploited these.\" 1023 It is thus apparent that China's role in the conspiracy against Nasser was clearly working on behalf of its secr et Mossad ally. What' s more, as Deacon pointed out, \"It was partly through intelligence leaked to the Chinese and some Iraqis that Iraq cut its links with the KGB and quarreled with the pro - Soviet government of Syria.\" 102 4"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"[410] Final Judgment 507 According to Deacon, it was i n this period (which, we will note, followed the Kennedy assassination) that \"China gradually became disillusioned with what it regarded as 'bourgeois military Arab regimes' in the Middle East and Chinese support for Palestine guerrillas eased off in the e arly seventies when Peking's indictments of Israel seemed somewhat moderated.\" 102 5 \"In 1973,\" Deacon pointed out, \"an Israeli double - agent was reported to have been effectively master - minded Israeli - Chinese intelligence operations in Africa. 1026 And in l ight of Israel's intimate ties with factions in French intelligence (not to mention the French role in Israel's nuclear development) it is more than of passing interest to note, as pointed out by Deacon, that: \"In Khartoum in the early seventies, the Chine se Intelligence Service was credited with having established some unusual links with both the French Intelligence in neighboring territories, north and south, and with Israel.\" 1027 It is very clear that there were many areas in which Israel and Red China h ad mutual interests. Richard Deacon said, quite correctly, that one of those areas was \"in a joint effort to thwart Russian influence in the Middle East\" 1028 which, in the coming years, led the two countries to engage in a wide variety of endeavors even wh ile, publicly, Israel and the Asian communist giant were ostensibly at odds. For example, as noted by Benjamin Beit - Hallahman, by the 1970's, the combination of Israel, Saudi Arabia and China were supporting the anti - Soviet forces in Afghanistan. 1029 Both China and its enemy, Taiwan, also joined Israel in supplying arms to Iran during the Iran - Iraq war. 10 30 In supplying arms to Iran, Israel's logic, according to Israel's then - ambassador to the United States, speaking in 1982, was \"to keep channels to the I ranian military open, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the Khomeini regime.\" 1031 According to Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, \"Israel wished Iran to win against Iraq, which is an enemy Arab state.\" 1032 THE MOSSAD AND CHINA Israeli historians Dan Rav iv and Yossi Melman, writing in their history of Israeli intelligence summarized the nature of the covert relationship between Israel and Red China as it was conducted through the Mossad: \"Acting widely as an alternative diplomatic service, the Mossad has opened doors and maintained relations with dozens of countries which prefer that these connections not be known . . . The Mossad simply gives the other nations an easy way out — receiving military, medical, and agricultural advice from the over - enthusiastic Israelis without risking economic or political boycotts by the Arab world . . . \"Both the spy - diplomats and the official diplomats of Israel are thrilled, in fact, when a foreign nation does agree to establish open relations with the Jewish state . . . In most cases, however, Israel has to live with the reality"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"508 Quid Pro Quo? [411] that many foreign states insist on doing it the secret way. Fearing leaks to the press, they refuse to deal with Israel's foreign ministry. They do benefit from a bilateral relationship, however, a nd have developed complete confidence in the Mossad's ability to be the great guardian of secrecy.\" 1033 And of course, China has been one of those countries, according to Raviv and Melman. 1034 All of this, of course, does direct us toward a very clear (but long - secret) Israeli - Red Chinese nexus in the nuclear arena — at the very time when JFK was not only seeking to stop Israel's nuclear expansion, but actually planning a military strike against China's efforts. However, when we nail down the precise name of the individual who served as the liaison between the Israelis and the Red Chinese during this critical period, we see indeed that there is a \"Chinese connection\" (via the Israelis) to the JFK assassination conspiracy. THE PERMINDEX CONNECTION . . . Israe l's longtime middleman in the Mossad's secret dealings with China — Shaul Eisenberg — was so deeply involved in dealings with Red China that when he dropped dead of a sudden heart attack at age 76 on March 27, 1997, it was not even in Israel, but in Peking. Ei senberg — whom we first met in Chapter 7 — was closely and directly connected (at the time of the JFK assassination) to the Permindex operation which spun the web of conspiracy in the JFK assassination. Once described by an Israeli writer as \"the richest Jew i n the world\" 1035 Eisenberg was, as we have seen, not only a key figure in Israel's nuclear development programs but also a partner of Permindex banker Tibor Rosenbaum in the Mossad financial operation known as the Swiss - Israel Trade Bank. Dan Raviv and Yos si Melman describe Eisenberg and his long covert history as Israel's contact with Red China as follows: \"Israel's wealthiest businessman, Eisenberg was born in Europe and found refuge during World War II in the Far East. He settled in Japan, where he marri ed a Japanese woman and made his fortune selling war surplus and scrap metal. \"Eisenberg quickly established himself as one of the leading middle - men in the region. He never lost his awareness of being a Jew, however, and his emotional ties led him to set up businesses in Israel and then to move his family there. He kept his interests in the Far East and in the late 1970s was able to pave a pathway to Beijing for Israeli military exports. \"His most formidable tool was his private jet, on which he could igno re the official hostility between the two nations and fly high - level Israelis directly to China. Eisenberg made dozens of trips, carrying [security assistance] officials, army advisers, financiers, and military salesmen for what the Israelis described as t heir 'toughest negotiations ever.'"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"[412] Final Judgment 509 \"After making a solid initial contact, Eisenberg would leave the coordination of hidden deals and shipments to the Mossad, which acted in its traditional role as Israel's secret alternative foreign ministry. \" 1036 Eisen berg, who ran 20 companies doing business in more than 30 countries 1037 was clearly a figure of central and critical importance to the survival of Israel and its positioning in the world arena. The Washington Times described Eisenberg's ensconcement in Is rael after his years abroad: \"Moving to Israel, Mr. Eisenberg became the most powerful tycoon in its history. The 'Eisenberg Law' was passed in the 1970's to free him of the country's massive tax burden so he would continue to operate from there . . . He c ontrolled the giant Israel Corporation holding company and held a 49 percent share in the national shipping company, Zim, one of the largest shipping and transportation companies in the world. He also dominated Israel Chemicals.\" 1038 Eisenberg's major role in Israel's chemical industry is interesting, of course, inasmuch as we noted in Appendix Four, that in 1957, in partnership with the Rosenbaum and Eisenberg - controlled Swiss - Israel Trade Bank, Michigan industrialist Max Fisher — the political kingmaker beh ind Warren Commission member Gerald Ford — bought a controlling interest in the Israeli conglomerate that dominated the petrochemical industry in Israel. So Eisenberg himself had a direct link with one of the so - called \"mystery men behind Gerald Ford\" who to ld Ford \"what to do and when to do it.\" EISENBERG'S FRENCH CONNECTION In reference to the Zim shipping company, it will be recalled, as we noted in Chapter 9, that it was Zim, jointly owned by Eisenberg and the Israeli government, that hired French Gener al Maurice Challe, one of the leading conspirators in the Permindex - backed OAS, after Challe was released from prison for his involvement in plots against Charles DeGaulle. So clearly, Eisenberg was most definitely a \"man in the middle\" in many ways in rel ation to key players and events that have been linked to the intimate circles of conspiracy that led to the JFK assassination. However, despite all of Eisenberg's vast wealth, according to the Washington Times, \"What made [Eisenberg] most interesting were his links to the Israeli secret service, the Mossad. Israeli intelligence sources say he shared information with the Mossad for decades and employed many former senior intelligence and army officers.\" 1039 The \"official\" story is that Eisenberg's dealings w ith China (at least in the realm of arms transfers) began only in 1979. Uri Dan, writing in the New York Post, reports that at that time, then - Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin got U.S. approval for authorizing Eisenberg to undertake a $10 billion 10 - y ear deal to modernize the Chinese armed forces thereby \"strengthening the counterbalance to Soviet military might.\" 1 0 4 0 Dan describes this deal as \"one of the most important in Israeli history\" 1 0 41 and"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"510 Quid Pro Quo? [413] that \"the Chinese insisted on absolute secrecy . . . [but that] secrecy was no problem for Eisenberg.\" 1042 It appears that Israel had already calculated that it simply could not open up direct diplomatic relations and business deals with Red China until — at first — the United States had already opened the doo r. In 1969, Yigal Allon, then Israel's deputy prime minister, had said publicly, \"Perhaps, when a positive change occurs in the relations between the USA and China, some sort of change will occur in the Chinese attitude toward us.\" 1043 Thus, after Richard Nixon, as U.S. president, did open the door to Red China, Israel's maneuvering began and Eisenberg launched on the secret \"official\" deals that ultimately became part of the public record. In fact, it was only well after Eisenberg's secret (but really not so secret) arrangement of the first arms sales to China was set in motion in 1979 that the major media in the West began reporting (without comment) at the revelations of Israel's arms deals with Red China — the giant Asian colossus that we had otherwise bee n told was hostile to tiny Israel. THE TRUTH EMERGES The first notation of an important arms relationship between China and Israel came in the staid and little - read (but highly influential) British journal, Jane's Defense Weekly , in November of 1980 10 44 — five years after Eisenberg's \"official\" entree into dealings with China on behalf of Israel. While Jane's estimated that the Israeli arms trade with China might be as high as $3 billion, Israel's annual arms exports were approximately $4 billion 1045 at th at time, which means that fully 75% of Israel's arms exports were headed for China, clearly its best customer. It was some three months later that the general public heard mainstream media reports about Jane's revelations of the Israeli - Red Chinese arms de als. On January 24, 1985, for example, the Washington Times reported that \"Israel is believed to have about 200 military advisers in China and to be filling arms orders from Peking worth more than $1 billion.\" 1046 The Times reported that a Chinese Embassy spokesman said that his government was not buying arms from Israel; at the same time an Israeli Embassy spokesman in Washington said he could \"neither confirm nor deny\" 1047 the reports about joint Chinese and Israeli arms transfers. Thus, after nearly fort y years of covert dealings between the Mossad and the Chinese intelligence service that had never been reported in the press, the Western media began to advise its readers that — lo and behold — Israel had been selling billions of arms to China since the deal was first set in place by Shaul Eisenberg in 1979. However, the secret relationship, as we've seen, was one which seems to have been cemented firmly by about 1963 — probably on November 22 when John F. Kennedy's plans for a military attack on Red China's nuc lear"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"[414] Final Judgment 511 facilities came to an abrupt end. And less than one year later Red China exploded its first nuclear bomb. Was this, in fact, a joint Chinese - Israeli operation? Although it is now an \"open secret\" that Israel has nuclear weapons, Israel had to have t ested its capabilities somewhere. And in 1964, it now appears likely, Israel did test its own first nuclear bomb — in secret conjunction with its secret ally, the People's Republic of China. The \"official\" story is that Israel \"may have\" conducted its \"first \" atomic test off the coast of South Africa in 1979, but, as we have seen, there is evidence to suggest otherwise. The assassination of John F. Kennedy by Red China's secret ally, the Mossad, in league with the Mossad's other allies in the CIA and the Lans ky Crime Syndicate, made possible the success of the joint Israeli - Red Chinese nuclear bomb project that would have been frustrated had JFK lived. THE ISRAELI LOBBY REACTS In the United States, the Israeli lobby — and Israel's partisans within what was the n the \"hard - line anti - communist\" administration of Ronald Reagan — seem to have been fully enthusiastic about Israel's \"new\" alliance with Red China (as though, of course, they weren't aware of it already). For example, the Washington Times reported that: \"A ssistant Defense Secretary Richard Perle, the [Reagan] administration official most responsible for trying to deny U.S. weapons technology to [Soviet - bloc] communist countries is said to favor the Israel - China arms link. Also said to favor the traffic is S tephen Bryen, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, [a Bryan's principal deputy] who was formerly president of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs,\" 1 0 48 an influential lobby for Israel. So it was that Jewish power brokers in the highest r anks of the Reagan administration, known for their devotion to Israel's cause (and for their fervent criticisms of the Soviet Union), came forth as heavy - duty advocates of the Israeli - Red Chinese alliance. Some might question, obviously, how \"anti - communis t\" people such as Bryen and Perle really were (in light of the fact that Red China, of course, is a communist country). However, it's clear that Bryen and Perle, among others, were simply endorsing the new policy because that is precisely what Israel wante d. And, of course, by 2003 — when the United States launched a \"pre - emptive\" invasion of Iraq, with strong prodding from pro - Israel partisans, it was the aforementioned Richard Perle who was a virtual ringmaster in organizing the public relations drumbeat on behalf of war. In any event, although the facts about this alliance between Israel and China were there for those who were interested, the press (during this period) did not make too much of the open dealings between Red China and Israel, inasmuch as this was before the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War was still unofficially underway. What's more, there were still widespread concerns about both Soviet and Chinese communism among segments of"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"512 Quid Pro Quo? [415] the American population, particularly among so - called \"Christi an Right\" supporters of Israel, led by figures such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, among others. It was simply not something that Israel wanted discussed too often. In fact, several years after the first reports about the new Israeli - Red Chinese deali ngs, the Washington Post reported candidly on May 23, 1988 (and quite correctly) that \"little has been published in the United States about Israel's flourishing arms relationship with China\" 1049 but noted that a \"a rare discussion of the linkage\" 1050 was p ublished in April of 1988 by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency — hardly a forum read by the average American voter who might have some questions about Israel's dealings with the communist empire. BEN - GURION'S DREAM ACHIEVED In any event, by June 13, 1990 the Los Angeles Times was reporting that Israel had become the largest supplier of advanced military technology to China. 1051 And by this time, the no - holds - barred public relationship between the two long - time secret partners began to escalate, h owever. In June 1991 China and Israel signed a bilateral agreement on scientific cooperation. On January 24, 1992 China and Israel established formal diplomatic relations to much fanfare in the world press and with much celebration in the worldwide Jewish media. Surveying the Israeli - Chinese relationship, Israeli historian Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi had declared that: \"Open diplomatic relations with China would be the greatest achievement in the history of Israeli Third World diplomacy. \"1052 So it was that afte r years of delicate, secret tactical maneuvers between the Mossad and the Chinese, the great dream of John F. Kennedy's bitter opponent, David Ben - Gurion, had finally been achieved and \"two of the world's most ancient peoples\" had been brought together. Ta ken together and analyzed, the evidence indicates that unity between Israel and Red China had been forged, in large part, through the Mossad's role in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Writing some years before the open unity between Israel and Red Chi na, intelligence historian Richard Deacon noted, quite correctly, that \"the Chinese and the Israelis appreciate that they have many common interests.\" 1053 And one of those common interests was the joint success of their respective efforts to build nuclear arsenals. Based upon all we have considered in Final Judgment — it thus seems likely that there was indeed a quid pro quo between Israel and Red China: in return for Peking's support for Israel's nuclear weapons projects, Israel ensured that President Johnso n canceled JFK's planned attack on China's nuclear facilities after the Mossad, in league with its allies in the CIA and the mob, put LBJ into the White House."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"[416] Final Judgment 513 It also seems probable that the Red Chinese were aware — in advance — of the impending assassinati on of President Kennedy, having probably been clued in by none other than Shaul Eisenberg who was moving in the Mossad circle involved directly in the JFK assassination. Although Red China certainly benefited from the death of John F. Kennedy, the anti - Sov iet [and pro - Israel] zealots in the CIA such as James Angleton were busy pointing the finger at Cuba and the USSR. The possibility that Red China had a hand in the affair was never mentioned — although, of course, a Red Chinese motive was more logical than a ny attached to either Cuba or Soviet Russia. In fact, to point a direction of blame toward Red China could have actually started some people looking in the direction of Israel if the full truth about China's secret nuclear arrangements with Israel ever cam e out. If the subject of JFK's opposition to China's nuclear weapons program had been made an issue, it was entirely possible that someone could have dared point out that JFK was also opposed to Israel's nuclear intentions. And that could only up a Pandora 's box that, obviously, Israel wanted left closed. Looking at the big picture in a long - term perspective, Israel decided that its interests did lie in an alliance with Red China (as David Ben - Gurion had long believed). And so, when John F. Kennedy began mo ving to stop the two (secretly) allied nations from building nuclear weapons, Israel took affirmative measures to counter the American president. Thus, although Shaul Eisenberg will be largely remembered in the \"official\" histories as the legendary figure who \"opened up\" Red China for Israel, it is also clear (for those who can also see the big picture) that Eisenberg was most assuredly a central figure in arranging the quid pro quo between Red China and Israel that ultimately played a part in the JFK assas sination conspiracy. It is appropriate then that Israeli writer Uri Dan called this powerful Mossad arms dealer and world - wide mover and shaker, \"the last Jewish mandarin\" 1054 (a \"mandarin,\" of course, being a Chinese warlord). Shaul Eisenberg not only hel ped Israel survive a critical period in its history (when David Ben - Gurion perceived JFK to be a threat to Israel's survival), but he also helped Israel's Red Chinese allies develop the nuclear clout they needed to become a major player on the world scene. Thus, although some JFK assassination researchers are now looking in the direction of Red China, there's really nothing new about the \"new\" theory that the Red Chinese may have had a hand in the JFK assassination. For if — in the event that they did — the Red Chinese were very clearly doing it in alliance with their allies in Israel's Mossad. In summary, the \"Chinese Connection\" to the JFK assassination — like the so - called \"French Connection\" — is really the Israeli Connection. It is a story that has never been t old until now."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Appendix Ten: \"Israel's Dark Side\" Was Israeli Intelligence Involved in the Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin? Many Israelis today believe that Israeli intelligence played a part in the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Is it really then so extraordinary to suggest that Israeli intelligence played a part in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? Think about it. In the closing months of 1997 there was a highly - charged political frenzy underway in Israel — one that still cont inues to this day. The controversy stems from allegations (made by citizens of Israel) that elements in Israeli intelligence were, in fact, involved in the November 4, 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The British newspaper, the G uardian, described the \"prevailing tone of bitterness and division\" 1055 in Israel that followed Rabin's death as charges and countercharges were being made between rival political factions. Rabin's successor as Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, lashed out at the conspiracy theorists, saying their allegations were a \"blood libel against the state and its institutions.\" 1056 Essentially, the conflict boiled down to a debate over which faction — the Labor Party and its allies or the Likud Party and its allies — is mo re truly committed to the survival of the state of Israel. This debate has been long - standing but Rabin's assassination exacerbated matters considerably. In an interview several days after Rabin's assassination, David Axelrod, an American - born resident of the Israeli - occupied West Bank, expressed the viewpoint of many Israelis (and of some American Jews) it seems, when he declared of Rabin's assassination: \"It wasn't a Jew who was murdered. It was a traitor who was executed.\" 1057 Although Axelrod was charge d for making this highly inflammatory statement, he was ultimately acquitted, demonstrating indeed that his views have widespread support in Israel. However, the popular support for Axelrod's opinions are also borne out by a survey conducted among Israeli Jewish adults and released on the anniversary of the Rabin assassination. Describing the poll results as being reflective of \"Israel's Dark Side,\" 1058 the Washington Jewish Week newspaper said that, based upon extrapolations of the numbers of those respond ing to the poll, there are 300,000 Israelis \"who justify and support political assassination in theory,\" 1059 180,000 Israelis \"who support harming any prime minister who would return land for peace, including Yitzhak Rabin,\" 1060 45,000 Israelis \"who openly support political murder,\" 1061 and 1,000 Israelis \"who would pull the trigger themselves.\" 106 2"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"[418] Fi nal Judgment 515 Clearly, Israel's people are serious about their nation's survival — and many would be willing to kill one of their own prime ministers to ensure it. One might even go so far as to say that Israel may be \"a nation of violence.\" What is fascinating is that the Israeli conspiracy theories regarding the Rabin assassination are at least as complex as some of those that have come forth in the aftermath of the assassin ation of President John F. Kennedy. According to the American Jewish weekly, Forward, \"Most of those theories center on the actions of Avishai Raviv, an agent provocateur who overstepped the mandate given him by [Israel' s] General Security Service to infi ltrate and report on the right - wing extremist groups that spawned\" 1 0 63 Prime Minister Rabin's assassin, Yigar Amir. Working with Amir, Raviv organized paramilitary training for the very circle of right - wing extremists that Mr. Raviv was penetrating. Forwar d said that the conspiracy theorists say that \"Mr. Raviv is believed to have goaded Amir toward violence by implying that his manhood depended on translating his zeal into action.\" 1064 What's more, noted Forward, Israel's \"right wing\" National Religious Pa rty newspaper Hatzofeh has charged, according to Forward, that \"Rabin knew of the assassination plot and let it go forward on the condition that the bullets in Amir's gun were changed to blanks. Following this logic, a failed attempt would allow Rabin to c rack down on right - wing opponents who believed his concessions to the Palestinians squandered the Biblical inheritance and endangered the state. \"At the last minute, Hatzofeh opined, [Shimon] Peres and a secret service official colluded to replace the blan ks with live bullets.

KENNEDY, Jr. SPEAKS To make matte rs worse for Israel, international attention has been focused on the growing conflict arising from the Rabin assassination and the conspiracy theories that have evolved. The first major report in the mainstream media in America about the controversy in Isr ael came from a very interesting source, especially considering what we have explored in the pages of Final Judgment. In the March 1997 issue of his magazine, George, John F. Kennedy Jr. published an article by the mother of Yitzhak Rabin's assassin in whi ch the woman, Geula Amir, alleged that her son, Yigal Amir, was goaded into killing Rabin on November 5, 1995 by Avishai Raviv, who was an undercover agent for Shin Bet, Israel's security agency. The article was highly controversial and some accused young Kennedy of interfering in Israel's political affairs not only by giving the assassin's mother a forum to discuss her conspiracy theory, but also by giving"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"516 ”Israel’s Dark Side” [419] American readers a less - than - positive view of Israeli affairs that they would not have unless they were readers of American Jewish newspapers. In an editorial note, Kennedy said that he was publishing the interview with the assassin's mother in the hope that \"my family history would bring attention to their story.\" 1066 However, it was clearly an interve ntion by young Kennedy in Israel's internal political affairs — a highly unusual move, and not one that was widely appreciated in many circles. In fact, not long afterward, JFK Jr.'s friend, business partner and co - publisher, Michael Berman quit George magaz ine, citing differences with his partner. Some observers suggested that it was precisely that inflammatory article that offended Berman, who is Jewish and said to be a strong supporter of Israel. Leah Rabin — the widow of the slain prime minister — responded a ngrily to JFK Jr.'s article, demanding, \"How, of all people, could he do such a thing?\" Mrs. Rabin said she never talked about her husband's murder but made an exception to denounce Kennedy's article, saying that JFK Jr. had crossed the \"red line\" 1067 by g iving \"a platform in his magazine to the mother of my husband's murderer.\" 1 0 68 In all fairness to Mrs. Rabin, however, she later publicly called for a re - opening of the investigation into her husband's murder saying, \"many questions remain in the air.\" 1 0 69 In the end — particularly after JFK Jr's tragic death in 1999 — more than a few people, including Israeli journalist Barry Chamish, suggested perhaps that \"John John\" had heard about Final Judgment, and his decision to publish the Rabin assassination story wa s a signal of precisely that. Later, in the question - and - answer section, we'll discuss the strange death of JFK, Jr. and demonstrate the unusual role that a \"former\" Mossad operative played in the events surrounding that tragedy. SUPPORT FOR ASSASSINATION AS POLICY Whatever the case, what is all the more ironic is that even as all of these charges and counter - charges were being made within Israel, its foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, was caught in an embarrassing failed assassination attempt agai nst a Palestinian leader in Jordan. The bungled plot demonstrated that the Mossad does engage in assassination attempts on foreign soil. Yet, as the international press repeatedly reported, most Israelis were not particularly disturbed by the fact that the Mossad was engaged in such activities. Largely, it seems, Israelis were disturbed by the fact that their intelligence agency had bungled the job with the consequence that Israel was subjected to international condemnation. The Washington Post, in a provoc ative front page headline, summarized it best: \"For Many Israelis, Assassination Is Only as Bad as Its Execution.\" 107 0 The Post reported, frankly, that \"In the national mortification over a failed assassination attempt in Jordan, Israelis are dissecting ev ery tactical, technical and procedural flaw in the affair."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"[420] Final Judgment 517 \"Strikingly absent from the debate, however, is a question that might be expected elsewhere: Should the government be in the business of dispatching assassins to kill its enemies abroad? For Isra eli Jews, profoundly insecure still in their 50th year of statehood, the answer appears to be self - evident.\"' 1071 Rather than debating the morality of political assassination, according to the Post, \"what Israelis are debating instead are the mechanics of the assassination attempt and the calibration of political risk. Among Israelis, the only fundamental critics of assassination as policy are its Arab citizens.\" 107 2 According to the Post, a spokesman for current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that, in ordering the Mossad assassination attempt in Jordan, Netanyahu \"did what every other prime minister would have done.\" 107 3 The Post said that \"Israelis argue that they are locked in a life or death struggle and have no practical choice of too ls. What is interesting is something else that the Post reported: that Israeli officials have said that when faced with hostile governments — as opposed to terrorists — the Israelis \"have other means of pressure and do not resort to assassination. But terroris ts . . . can be combated only in kind.\" 1074 Israel does indeed have what the Baltimore Sun has described as an \"unacknowledged but widely documented history of assassinating its enemies,\" 1075 and now Final Judgment has come along as the first book ever to document not only why Israel perceived John F. Kennedy as an enemy, but precisely how Israel played a part in his assassination in 1963. Although the pro - Israel lobby in America has reacted quite hysterically to the allegations made in Final Judgment, we have seen that not only do many Israelis actually believe it's possible that their own domestic intelligence agency played a hand in the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, but also that many Israelis endorsed that assassination, perceiving their own prime min ister as a threat to Israel's survival. Israelis, in general, do believe in the use of assassination as a force for political change and as a means whereby which to ensure the survival of their beloved country. As many American conservatives say: \"Those Is raelis sure are tough. They won't take any nonsense from anybody.\" With all of this in mind, is it really so \"beyond the pale\" to suggest that in 1963 — when Israel's Prime Minister, David Ben - Gurion, perceived John F. Kennedy to be a threat to Israel's surv ival — that the Mossad then participated in a conspiracy to assassinate the American president? If, as polls have suggested, many Israelis truly put so little value on the life of their own prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin (viewed by many in Israel as a \"traito r\") and actually would \"pull the trigger\" themselves, is it really so \"ridiculous\" to suggest that the Mossad did indeed play a part in the assassination of John F. Kennedy? What do you think?"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"518 [421] Afterword: The Continuing Cover - Up Today, millions of Americ ans — and people from around the globe — are convinced that there was indeed a conspiracy behind the assassination of the thirty - fifth president of the United States and that the United States government was a willing participant in the cover - up. In the wake o f the renewed public interest — much of it stimulated by Oliver Stone's controversial film, JFK — growing demands for release of the secret JFK files held by the government reached a fever pitch. Ultimately, there was indeed a bill passed by Congress calling f or the release of the documents and many documents — though not all of them — were released. As far as the legislation to open the files was concerned, there were more than a few people who believed the legislation itself was suspect. Here's why: First of all, the individual called in to lend his expertise as the primary architect of the legislation was the controversial G. Robert Blakey, the former director of the House Assassinations Committee. In Chapter 10, of course, we reviewed Blakey's spurious findings which essentially suggested that \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" and also examined Blakey's close relationship with the CIA which led his critics to suspect that perhaps the House investigation was being scuttled from within. What's more, we also explored Blakey's enigmatic relationship with Morris Dalitz, one of Meyer Lansky's closest long - term associates and a major backer of the Israeli lobby in this country. With all of this baggage — little known to the general public at least — Blakey was an unusual choice, unles s, of course, Congress (as many suspect) didn't really want to get to the truth. However, the legislation that Blakey drafted was equally controversial. Under Blakey's proposal, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington would appoint a five member c itizen board to review and decide on the release of the assassination investigation documents. The legislation did specify that any persons previously involved in any investigation of the JFK assassination would not be eligible for appointment to the board . In fact, it appears as though that proposed legislation itself was yet a continuing part of the cover - up — a sop to the public — an effort to make it appear as though \"something is being done to solve the JFK assassination puzzle.\" Why Congress and Blakey de cided upon the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. as the body which should select the \"blue ribbon\" document review panel is not so much of a mystery — that is, if one believes that the Establishment is still trying to keep the truth about the assassi nation hidden and buried forever. It appears as though the proposed blue ribbon panel would have been nothing less than a government - sponsored CIA"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"[422] Final Judgment 519 laundry which will make sure that any incriminating evidence in the files never sees the light of day. Unde r Blakey's legislation, one of the very judges on that appeals court which would select the panel was former Sen. James L. Buckley — brother of ex - CIA man William F. Buckley, Jr., agency protégé and longtime friend of E. Howard Hunt, himself implicated in th e JFK murder. Buckley, in an even earlier incarnation, prior to his single term in the Senate, before being ousted by the voters of New York, had engaged in lucrative family oil dealings in Israel. As we saw in Chapter 9, it was in then - Senator Buckley's N ew York office that the anti - Castro Cuban brothers, Guillermo and Ignacio Novo, met with Mossad - linked mercenary Michael Townley to plot the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The Novo brothers, of course, were named by ex - CIA operative Ma rita Lorenz as among those who traveled in a two - car caravan from Miami to Dallas, arriving on November 21, 1963. Upon arrival in Dallas the CIA hirelings were met by their CIA paymaster, E. Howard Hunt. They were also visited in their Dallas quarters by D allas nightclub keeper Jack Ruby. So it was that Judge James L. Buckley would have been one of those who would play a pivotal role in selecting the final arbiters of what the public will be allowed to see in the JFK assassination files — after, of course, th ose files had been carefully laundered by the CIA. As it was, the Congress did act, after much debate, and approved a bill requiring government - wide disclosure of documents relating to the assassination. The disclosure law set up a five - member review board with the power to obtain assassination records from any government office, the CIA and FBI and committees of Congress. The board, in fact, began releasing many documents — some interesting, of course, but nothing so inflammatory as to require a new investig ation. MARWELL AND THE MOSSAD Frankly, the release of documents by the JFK Assassination Documents Review Board was an exercise in futility. The newly released documents only give the JFK assassination \"buffs\" something to salivate over. Nothing truly ex plosive has come out thus far. Those documents that have been released only seem to have confirmed everything that has already been a part of the JFK lore. The evidence, in fact, suggested that the fox was minding the chicken coop at the JFK Assassination Records Review Board. David Marwell, the first head of the review board, is a former historian for the Justice Department's controversial Office of Special Investigations (OSI), the so - called \"Nazi\" hunting unit of the Justice Department. The OSI, of cours e, is best known for having spearheaded the reckless and now widely - discredited persecution of Ukrainian - American John"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"520 The Continuing Cover - Up [423] Demjanjuk, the Ohio man who was cleared of the OSI' s charges by an Israeli court after nearly a decade of contentious international in vestigation that nearly saw Demjanjuk die at the end of the hangman's noose. Now, some may ask, why should Marwell's association with the OSI be so controversial, inasmuch as \"Nazi - hunting\" is generally considered to be a highly admirable avocation? There are several notable reasons: First of all, since there are still some (but not many) JFK assassination researchers who believe that the Soviet KGB or elements under its influence may have had a hand in orchestrating the JFK assassination, Marwell's previou s OSI affiliation could prove embarrassing. After all, in the Demjanjuk case (as one example), the OSI relied heavily on KGB - forged documents (which falsely suggested Demjanjuk was a Nazi concentration camp guard) to deport Demjanjuk from the United States for trial in Israel (where, of course, he was eventually cleared). The fact is that the OSI had been seriously compromised by the KGB. Thus, if indeed the KGB did indeed play a part in the JFK murder, in any way, shape or form, Marwell's previous associat ion with the OSI creates some concern about Marwell's willingness to bring out all of the sensitive information within the JFK files. Now the KGB matter, troubling though it may be, is eclipsed even more so by Marwell's inevitable dealings (as an OSI offic ial) with Israel's Mossad. The Mossad has had a long - standing close relationship with the OSI, so there's no reason to doubt that the Mossad, like the KGB, has used its talents to compromise this American agency. (For the record: One scholar has pointed ou t the ties between the OSI and the Israelis. Wayne Madsen, writing in the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, pointed out: \"An unusual relationship exists between the Israeli Ministry of Justice's Investigation of Nazi Crimes Dep artment and the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) — formerly the Office of Special Investigations . . . Probably no other organization like the Justice Department's OJP routinely scours the numerous computer files the federal governm ent maintains on its citizens and passes confidential personal information to the Israelis.\" 1076 ) Thus, can we really be certain that Marwell would be sure to release any hidden documents that — however unlikely — would implicate the Mossad in any aspect of th e JFK assassination conspiracy, either directly or indirectly? For example, what if — just what if — there was a document buried in some JFK file under Marwell's jurisdiction that said flatly: \"New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw is considered by some to be a Mo ssad asset.\" Will that document ever be released? I doubt it. But there's much more. There's a second reason why we might find Marwell's presence at the JFK documents review board troubling. This reason is particularly intriguing and should give even those JFK assassination researchers who reject my own theory of Mossad involvement reason to question Marwell's reliability."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"[424] Final Judgment 521 During his association with the OSI, according to the September 8, 1995 issue of Forward, the influential Jewish weekly, Marwell \"play ed a key role in the hunt for Josef Mengele and is an authority on the Auschwitz doctor.\" 1 0 77 This alone spells trouble for Marwell's credibility for a very interesting and intriguing reason. THE POSNER CONNECTION You see, the aforementioned Gerald Posne r, author of the widely - promoted Case Closed (which reiterates the Warren Commission's fraudulent conclusions) has written several books and his first, published in 1986, was Mengele: The Complete Story. Posner's book was an account of the efforts by Marwe ll and the OSI to track down the infamous Auschwitz doctor. Thus, it really seems no strange coincidence — at least to me — that two \"auld acquaintances\" from the elite and glamorous world of Establishment - sponsored \"nazi - hunting\" and its literary promotion sh ould happen to emerge (nearly ten years later) as \"experts\" in another controversial arena: the JFK assassination. The very fact that two individuals with close ties to the world of intelligence, and with a special interest and expertise in an area of imme nse interest to the Mossad (i.e. Nazi - hunting) should show up as two of the primary players in the current controversy over the JFK assassination is interesting indeed, particularly in light of my own thesis of Israeli involvement in the JFK affair. Obviou sly, in light of all of this, I do not consider Marwell — or his records review board — credible. In fact, there are those who contend that the Mossad knew for years — long before the officially announced \"discovery\" that Mengele had died — that Mengele was indeed dead and that there was no reason to continue hunting the good doctor. But the Mossad kept this under wraps and allowed Nazi hunters and Jewish fund - raisers to continue churning up memories of Mengele coupled with the specter that the German physician was still alive experimenting on Jewish babies in the jungles of South America. What, I ask, did Marwell know — and when did he know it? Incriminating documents buried in the JFK assassination files would have been shredded long ago, and the most incriminating materials would never have been committed to paper in the first place. Don't count on something truly enlightening to have been uncovered, especially since Mr. Posner's friend Marwell, was in charge of the release of the documents. Marwell, and his assista nt at the review board, one Douglas Home, have gone on to greener and more lucrative pastures. They are now working for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, which is — needless to say — very closely cooperating with the Israeli government (and the Mossad) in a variety of ventures of interest to the worldwide Jewish community. That's a fact. Don't call me an \"anti - Semite\" for saying"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"522 The Continuin g Cover - Up [425] it. So once again we find Mr. Marwell involved in affairs that are intimately linked to the state of Israel. Just a coincidence, I'm sure. The activities of the review board provided an interesting distraction and were, in fact, all part and parcel of the continuing cover - up. PUBLISHING DISTORTIONS There are many aspects to the continuing cover - up as I learned when fi rst trying to get this book published. Knowing that New York - based Shapolsky Publishers had released two books on the JFK assassination, my publicist sent an outline of Final Judgment to them. Shortly, we received a handwritten postcard from Isaac Mozeson, Shapolsky's editorial director. The ferocity and hysteria in Mozeson's response was unlike anything I had ever seen. He described the theory outlined in Final Judgment as being \"infantile\" and wrote of the \"powerlessness\" of Israel's Mossad. I was, frankl y, amused by his response, but intrigued at the fury. It was then I did some checking. The 1992 edition of Writer's Market reveals that 40% of Shapolsky's publications are of \"Jewish interest.\" 1078 Shapolsky, it turns out, also just happens to be an affili ate of the Israeli - based Steimatsky Publishing House of North America. 1079 Interesting? Shapolsky's two books on the assassination are worth noting. The first Shapolsky concoction was David Scheim's Contract on America which is notable for primarily being a rehash of Lansky Syndicate - linked and CIA defender Robert Blakey's book, The Plot to Kill the President, which fixes the blame on \"The Mafia.\" Scheim, as we noted in Chapter 10, would have us believe that Meyer Lansky was a little fish in a very big pond — hardly an influence at all. He also scoffs at Jim Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw — an innocent bystander who was guilty only of restoring lovely old buildings in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The second Shapolsky book, First Hand Knowledge, by for mer CIA contract agent Robert Morrow, is subtitled \"How I Participated in the CIA - Mafia Murder of President Kennedy.\" This volume, an elaboration of Morrow's previous work, Betrayal, contains much useful information, beyond question, and obviously was writ ten by someone who was privy to much of what was happening in the CIA at the time of the assassination. However, what is notable about the volume is that Morrow specifically portrays the CIA's Mossad liaison, James J. Angleton, as somehow being out of the loop as far as the assassination and the cover - up was concerned. This, as we have seen, is just simply not true. Morrow even suggested elsewhere that Angleton and Robert F. Kennedy were famous friends, without documenting this unlikely scenario. And while Morrow does flatly accuse Clay Shaw of having been involved in the assassination conspiracy, even noting the Permindex link"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"[426] Final Judgment 523 — which he portrays as strictly a CIA venture and not related directly to the assassination conspiracy — he would have the reader bel ieve that the conspiracy against JFK by elements in the CIA went no higher than Shaw. Morrow's contention is that Shaw headed a \"rogue\" element based in New Orleans operating outside the control of the CIA headquarters at Langley where Angleton's influence was then supreme. Interestingly — for whatever it's worth — when Morrow was arrested for his participation in a CIA - orchestrated plan to counterfeit Cuban currency, the lawyer who handled his defense, Fred Weisgal, immigrated to Israel within a year after the JFK assassination and quickly became Israel's Deputy Minister of Justice, a high honor indeed. Perhaps Morrow hasn't told us everything he really knows and perhaps Weisgal's high post was a reward for assisting in some fashion in the JFK assassination cov er - up. THE ISRAELI LOBBY RESPONDS The response of the Israeli lobby to the release of the first edition of Final Judgment was quite interesting, to say the least. Washington Jewish Week (WJW), the leading newspaper of the pro - Israel lobby in the nation's capital, published a vituperative broadside blast at Final Judgment in a prominently placed full - page attack in its April 28, 1994 issue. The weekly newspaper savaged the book as a \"conspiracy theory\" l080 that presents the \"latest JFK murder fantasy.\" 1081 According to WJW, \"New kook - right book blames Israel.\" 1082 The charge that Final Judgment is somehow \"kook - right\" in its orientation is, of course, specious at best, inasmuch as many of the primary sources for the documentation of JFK's bitter behind - the - scenes fight with Israel are far from being \"right - wing,\" let alone \"kook - right.\" Never has anyone ever charged Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh (now a JFK basher himself), Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, former Ambassador George Ball, historian Alfred Lili enthal or Stephen Green, among others, with being \"kook - right.\" And, indeed, none of the JFK conspiracy theorists cited in Final Judgment have the reputation of being anything but good, old - fashioned liberals. Washington Jewish Week claimed that \"Piper spe nds most of his 302 pages quoting out - of - context secondary sources, making unlikely tenuous connections, and asserting untruths over and over as if their repetition will magically impart validity. \"1083 In short, WJW was suggesting that this author simply \" made up\" his facts, pure and simple. WJW said that the thesis presented in Final Judgment is \"speculative [and] \"bizarre,\" 1084 but, of course, never showed how or why it was. According to WJW, the book is \"anti - Jewish to its core\" 1 0 85 which, of course, is nonsense. In fact, among those who read the book prior to publication were Jewish authors, attorney Mark Lane, himself the nation's foremost authority on the JFK assassination, and Dr. Alfred Lilienthal, the"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"524 The Continuing Cover - Up [427] pioneer American Jewish critic of Israel and i ts powerful lobby in this country. Neither found the book to be \"anti - Jewish.\" In seeking to discredit the Israeli connection to the JFK assassination conspiracy, WJW slipped up and, effectively, confirmed the explosive nature of the facts about the Israel i connection to the JFK murder. WJW tried to discredit the Permindex connection to the JFK assassination by pointing out that Final Judgment noted that Permindex is mentioned in Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Then WJW added that Stone's film \"never claims to be factual,\" 1086 thus suggesting that Clay Shaw's Permindex connection was one of the instances of artistic license admittedly utilized by Stone in the making of the film. (And, ironically enough, as we have seen, Stone himself was gun - shy when it came to f acing the so - called \"French connection\" — that is, the Israeli connection — head on.) In short, WJW critiqued the film by a combination of name - calling, innuendo and playing fast and loose with the facts, an indirect admission that, clearly, Final Judgment hit s perhaps too close to home. Then, in 1995, the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, the American intelligence and propaganda conduit for the Mossad, weighed in with some false and defamatory smears of Final Judgment. The comments appeared in an e ssay appearing in a rather turgid anthology edited by Jerome Chanes and entitled Antisemitism in America Today: Outspoken Experts Explode the Myths. The essay in question — \"Antisemitism in America: A View from the 'Defense' Agencies\" — was the work of the ADL 's national director, Abe Foxman. According to the ADL's Foxman: \"Liberty Lobby, the nation's largest antisemitic propaganda mill, has similarly joined the JFK conspiracy craze by publishing Final Judgment, a book which purports to expose 'how the CIA, the Mossad and the Meyer Lansky Crime Syndicate collaborated in the murder of John F. Kennedy . . . . The book also presents new revelations which now show that the so - called 'French connection' to the JFK assassination is, in reality, the Israeli connection . . . [The book] brings forth new material which links former President George Bush to the JFK conspiracy.' Of course, Liberty Lobby's chief counsel, Mark Lane, had already written a JFK conspiracy book titled Plausible Denial; the organization's mania for conspiracies, however, appears to be inclusive enough to assimilate both theses. The effort of hate groups to use such outlandish ideas to lure the gullible into accepting their agendas, or at least part of them, is easy to understand.\" 108 7 Foxman accurat ely quoted promotional material for Final Judgment, but obviously I would disagree with Foxman's characterization of Liberty Lobby. I would also note that the ADL's spokesman calls the American interest in the JFK assassination a \"craze,\" reflecting the AD L's lack of appreciation for the concerns of many Americans about a possible conspiracy behind the assassination of an American president."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"[428] Final Judgment 525 Note, also, that the ADL dismissed Mark Lane as simply \"Liberty Lobby's chief counsel,\" as though that were Lane's sole claim to fame and that his own pioneering work in the JFK assassination arena — long before his association with Liberty Lobby — was of no substance. The ADL — obviously — wants people to forget that it was Lane's book, Rush to Judgment that started the whole JFK \"craze.\" It is interesting that the ADL commented that Liberty Lobby's so - called \"mania\" was \"inclusive enough to assimilate both theses\" [presented, presumably in Final Judgment and Plausible Denial]. Obviously, however, the books do not actually pre sent two different theses at all, but it's not in the interests of the ADL to accurately report the specific details that appear in either of the volumes. The ADL dismisses these \"outlandish ideas\" but it is interesting that the ADL felt compelled to take a slam at Final Judgment in the pages of this assembly of essays. Clearly, two years after the release of the first edition of Final Judgment, the book was making its impact felt — and the ADL knew it. There were enough people beginning to take the book seri ously, so much so that the ADL felt it necessary to respond. Later, when the ADL released its own outlandish report in 1996 entitled Danger: Extremism — The Major Vehicles and Voices on America's Far Right Fringe, the ADL rehashed Foxman's earlier essay and added, gratuitously — and falsely — that Final Judgment \"attempted to blame the assassination of President Kennedy on Jews.\" 1088 Although, frankly, I was tempted to bring suit against the ADL for libel, it would have cost more time and money and trouble than i t was worth. However, if the suit had reached trial — as did E. Howard Hunt's libel suit against The Spotlight, relating to the JFK assassination (described in Chapter 16) — it might have brought forth some interesting revelations. In any event, it's obvious t hat Final Judgment, by this time, was a subject of real concern on the part of the ADL. They realized that this book cannot be ignored. Thus, it is no surprise than when — in the fall of 1997 — I was invited to address the topic of the book at a community coll ege seminar in Orange County, California, that all Hell broke loose. In my foreword to this fourth edition of Final Judgment I've described that controversy in detail. But needless to say, as I said earlier, the ADL has not heard the last of Final Judgment . This is only the beginning. Although Uri Palti, an Israeli diplomat in Los Angeles, told the press that the thesis presented in Final Judgment is \"nonsense,\" the big problem for the ADL and for Israel is that — obviously — a lot of people don't agree. In lig ht of all this frenzy stimulated by the ADL in its attempt to silence me, I cannot help but echo the words of an ADL ally, super - lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who loudly proclaimed himself a defender of academic freedom and came to the defense of another controv ersial researcher who came under fire for his studies of purported alien abductions. Dershowitz said that those who had criticisms of that research should \"respond to it on"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"526 The Continuing Cover - Up [429] the merits — by reviews, rebuttals, debates and books of their own. The marketplace of academic ideas is wide open . . . Eventually truth will out. That is what a university is all about.\" 1089 I can't help but wonder if Dershowitz shared the same concerns about the attack on my research by the ADL. But Dershowitz was right about one thin g: eventually truth will out. And the fact that no one, thus far, has been able to refute Final Judgment is very telling indeed. What is interesting is that, evidently, the allegations made in Final Judgment don't seem to be anything new to people in the A rab world. According to one Arab - American, M. M. Ali, writing in the December 1997 issue of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs: \"While Americans endlessly toy with new theories about the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, to Arabs it's an ope n - and - shut case. They feel certain the young U.S. president was killed because he was reassessing America's pro - Israel policy in the Israeli - Palestinian dispute.\" 1090 WHAT ABOUT THE JFK 'RESEARCHERS'? In retrospect it may well be that Oliver Stone's stu nning success with the film JFK may have done research into the JFK assassination controversy more harm than good. As we noted in Chapter 17, Stone's film focused new public interest on the controversy and gave millions of Americans and people worldwide a new perspective on the affair. The impact of the film was probably more significant, in the end, than a dozen best - selling books on the assassination combined. However, because of Stone's apparent determination to avoid the so - called \"French connection\" (a s documented in Chapter 17), and because of the multiple ties to the Israeli - Lansky combination on the part of Stone's corporate backers, we must indeed question the real motivation behind the decision to publicize an edited and factually skewed representa tion of the facts surrounding the JFK assassination controversy. Indeed — since Stone's financial angel, Arnon Milchan, just happened to be Israel's biggest arms dealer — one might conclude that Stone's film was nothing more than slickly - packaged and heavily - p romoted black propaganda and propaganda - for - profit at that! Because so many prominent and respected JFK assassination researchers took money from Stone and his backers — Jim Marrs, in particular, who received $300,000 for the rights to his book Crossfire — the y may have been unwittingly compromised. They are in an unpleasant position in which they will look rather bad if they choose to criticize Stone. Can the researchers now honestly criticize Oliver Stone? Can they admit that Stone's version of the assassinat ion conspiracy is off - base? Can they acknowledge that Stone's backers have intimate ties to the very powerful forces that stood to benefit by JFK's removal from the White House? These are questions that truth seekers must ask of the researchers."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"[430] Final Judg ment 527 Even a d evout JFK admirer such as James DiEugenio, author of Destiny Betrayed, must ask himself whether or not he has been fully forthcoming with his readers. In his well - written volume, which was nothing less than a paean to Jim Garrison, DiEugenio compiled a com pelling vindication of Garrison's case against Permindex board member Clay Shaw and his role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Yet, DiEugenio was quite circumspect in his dissection of Shaw's Permindex connection. Never once did DiEugenio delve into the Israeli connection. And although DiEugenio even went so far as to note Clay Shaw's relationship with the powerful Stern family of New Orleans, the owners of WDSU radio and television that played so central a part in portraying Lee Harvey Oswald as a \"pro - Castro extremist,\" DiEugenio was circumspect, to say the least, in his treatment of the Stern - Shaw connection. According to DiEugenio, the Stern family's motive for supporting Shaw was \"obvious.\" According to DiEugenio: \"They did not wish to see their city tarred with the conviction of one of its leading lights for conspiracy to murder President Kennedy.\" 1091 Was their motivation really that \"obvious\" or is DiEugenio skirting around the truth? DiEugenio, despite his in - depth research into other aspects of t he New Orleans connection to the assassination, never once referenced CIA operative Guy Banister's ties to ADL operative A. L. (Bee) Botnick, whose New Orleans office of the pro - Israel ADL received extensive funding from the Stern family (although, in all fairness, this may have been an oversight). As we have seen, however, it is not an extraordinary leap of the imagination to conjecture that Lee Harvey Oswald's assignment working for Guy Banister — resulting in Oswald's public image as a \"pro - Castro extremis t\" — may indeed have been part of an ADL - sponsored \"fact - finding\" operation carried out through Banister's detective agency. DiEugenio actually had good reason to be so reticent in pulling his punches. After all, it was Sheridan Square Press that published h is book. The prime movers behind Sheridan Square are Ellen Ray and William Schapp, founders of the so - called Institute for Media Analysis which (as noted earlier in Final Judgment ) includes among its financial backers the Stern Family Fund, established by Clay Shaw's friends, the powerful Stern family of New Orleans. All of this — at the very least — perhaps demonstrates how even the most dedicated JFK assassination researchers can be distracted or otherwise misdirected in their own efforts to seek the truth. A lthough I requested the opportunity to address the 1994 symposium of the JFK Assassination Information Center in Dallas and the 1996 conference of the Committee on Political Assassinations in Washington, the ruling cliques refused to allow me to speak.

In his excellent book Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, Scott has gone further than most JFK assassination researchers in exp loring the recurring Meyer Lansky connection to Jack Ruby and the CIA, for example, and pointing out CIA man James Jesus Angleton's peculiar role in the JFK controversy which we have outlined in detail in these pages. In these areas, among others, Scott ha s clearly done his research, but one cannot read his book without thinking that Scott has likewise tip - toed up to the Israeli connection, but refused to draw the obvious conclusions for his readers. Scott says a lot about many things, but says nothing when it comes to the Israeli links to the JFK assassination that have been thoroughly documented in Final Judgment. And despite his in - depth research in a wide variety of subjects relating to the JFK controversy, Scott has absolutely nothing to say whatsoever about Clay Shaw's Permindex connection. It is something that Scott obviously would prefer not to discuss. It is interesting to note that in his acknowledgements among those Scott thanks for assistance in the preparation of his book are two rather interesti ng sources: Wesley McCune of Group Research, Inc. and Michael Lerner. 1092 While ostensibly an \"independent\" research entity, Group Research has generally been described by its critics as a \"front\" for the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith, the i nfluential self - styled \"civil rights\" organization that has been exposed as an intelligence and propaganda conduit for Israel's Mossad. As noted in Chapter 17, the ADL's long - suspected Mossad link was brought to public light in a broad - ranging investigatio n by the San Francisco Police Department of the ADL's covert domestic spying operations aimed at a wide variety of both \"right wing\" and \"left wing\" political groups in the United States. Scott's other source, Michael Lerner, a prominent liberal philosophe r, also happens to be the publisher of Tikkun magazine, a Jewish - oriented journal which has emerged as a major voice for the Israeli lobby. That these sources played a part in shaping Scott's final judgment (if it can be described as such) perhaps explains in part Scott's clear and repeated effort to avoid broaching the Israeli connection to the assassination of President Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"[432] Final Judgment 529 This author can only conclude that these \"researchers\" who have spun their wheels, expended vast amounts of time, energy and m oney (not to mention having made money at that) in delving into the JFK affair would rather not cross the line, so to speak. I understand their reasoning, of course, but, at the same time, I am compelled to question their integrity. However, there have bee n a number of long - time JFK assassination researchers who have privately favorably acknowledged Final Judgment and the substance of its claims, whether they agree with its conclusions in the entirety or not. I will not name them here and thereby burden the m with the possibility of being tarred as \"anti - Semites\" — the favorite term reserved for those who dare to criticize the actions of Israel — but they know who they are and their support has been appreciated. SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS Just before Final Judgment wa s first published, I was delighted to learn that one long - time JFK assassination researcher, Philip Ten Brink, working entirely independently of this author, not so surprisingly reached essentially the same conclusions reached in Final Judgment, even up to and including a number of fine points that some might find somewhat esoteric. I am compelled to repeat the old saw that \"great minds think alike,\" but I would be overstating the case in so doing. It is simply that the facts are there for those who wish to recognize them for what they are. Ten Brink discovered on his own that pointing the finger in the direction of Israel and the Mossad is not good public relations. When he spoke on his findings at the 1993 symposium of the JFK Assassination Information Cen ter in Dallas, Ten Brink advised me, there were a lot of people who were uneasy, to say the least, that someone within their ranks was being \"politically incorrect.\" Hats off to Ten Brink for having the guts to call the shots at he saw it. The same can't b e said for those JFK assassination researchers who see the truth but are afraid to admit it. After the fourth edition of Final Judgment was published, I learned of another JFK researcher, Dave Sharp, who had been active on Internet news groups for some tim e, making the allegation that Jewish political interests — particularly the Bronfman family of Canada — were behind the JFK assassination. At that point, not having yet read Final Judgment, Sharp apparently had no idea of the conflict between JFK and Ben - Gurio n over Israel's nuclear bomb, so it would seem that Final Judgment did indeed fill in a missing piece of the puzzle for Sharp. However, Sharp himself has since then been critical of Final Judgment, suggesting that I fell down on the job in failing to discu ss the Holocaust and the way that it has been used as a political tool by the Israeli lobby. That's Sharp's opinion, of course, but — as I have said time and again — Final Judgment is about the JFK assassination, not about the Holocaust."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"530 The Continuing Cover - Up [433] I am indebted to Sha rp, however, in providing me some valuable data about the financial affairs of the Bronfman family — including their little - known ties to the \"Texas oil interests\" that are often linked to the JFK assassination — an interesting point indeed. ANSWER THE QUESTI ON 'WHY?' Unfortunately, most of those who purport to be seeking the truth about the JFK assassination are only willing to go so far. Will the \"researchers\" continue to dabble in esoteric questions as to \"how many bullets were fired?\" or \"where did the bu llets hit?\" or will they once and for all attempt to answer that overwhelming question most important of all: Why was John F. Kennedy murdered and who, ultimately, was responsible? To answer that question one cannot avoid the until - now secret fact of JFK's battle to prevent Israel from building the nuclear bomb, for Israel — like its allies in both organized crime and the CIA — did have a strong motive to move against JFK and did. What about Israel and its aggressive campaign to build the nuclear bomb — the contr oversy that played so central a role in the events that led to the assassination of John F. Kennedy? In the end, it was Israel — not JFK — that had the last word on the matter. The November 1994 issue of Jane's Intelligence Review reported that Israel had, by that time, developed seven nuclear installations and as many as 200 nuclear weapons — enough to make tiny Israel the world's sixth - largest nuclear power. According to a summary of Jane's report that appeared in the Associated Press on November 19, 1994: \"The Israeli government neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons, and has tried to keep the country's nuclear program secret. It has not signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty, which would open its facilities to international inspection.\" 1093 So much, then, for JFK's strenuous efforts to put a stop to nuclear expansion in the Middle East. Any hope of success came to a crashing halt on November 22, 1963. WHAT ABOUT THE KENNEDY FAMILY? Many readers of Final Judgment have asked if the Kennedy fami ly has responded to the allegations made in this volume. Not publicly, at least. But we can be confident that the Kennedy family — above all — does indeed know the truth about the JFK assassination. But don't expect the family to ever go public with any knowle dge they might have of Mossad involvement in the affair. It will never happen. Too much is at stake. Shortly after the first edition of Final Judgment came out, I received word that someone from Massachusetts who was close to the Kennedy family had purchas ed five copies of the book. And, more recently, I sent"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"[434] Final Judgment 531 copies of Final Judgment to not only John F. Kennedy, Jr., but to all of the editors of his monthly magazine George. I'm sure that the editors had an interesting time reading the book and discussing it among themselves, but I don't frankly expect to see a story about it in George However, I do know for a fact that members of the Kennedy family have heard about Final Judgment. First of all, a friend of mine who lives in Rhode Island met Congressman Pat rick Kennedy (son of Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts) at a public function. There he showed a copy of Final Judgment to young Kennedy and pointed out that the book implicates the Mossad and the Lansky Crime Syndicate in the assassination. According to my friend, the young congressman recoiled in horror. I'm not surprised. After all, no politician in America would want to be identified with a conspiracy theory critical of Israel — particularly, of course, after what happened to John F. Kennedy when he went h ead - to - head with Israel. And as I said, if anybody knows who really killed JFK, it's his family, so to hear that a book had actually been written on the subject must have come as a real surprise. But, finally, on December 20, 1995 I had occasion to speak b riefly, for the first time, with a member of the Kennedy family about this book. I was at Union Station in Washington, D.C. and much to my surprise Congressman Joe Kennedy, son of the late Robert Kennedy, walked in my direction. He stopped less than ten fe et from me. He was in the company of an attractive woman whom I later identified as his second wife. Frankly, I did not want to badger the man. He is very much a public figure and a member of a very public family that has been subjected to an immense amoun t of scrutiny by the big media in America (the same media that has kept the truth about the assassinations of both his father and his uncle under wraps). Yet, on the other hand, I had written a book on that subject (and, by this time, it was a book that pe ople were beginning to take quite seriously.) So I felt obligated to speak with him. The congressman glanced in my direction and our eyes met. He knew I recognized him and I suspect that he also knew I wanted to speak to him and I made up my mind that I wo uld. I approached him and said, \"Congressman, I want just 22 seconds of your time.\" He smiled. I knew he'd heard words to that effect so many times and I'd deliberately chosen that approach and I think he appreciated the irony, inasmuch as I spoke in an am used tone as if to say, \"Yes, I know you've heard that one before.\" He nodded his head, and I said, \"I have to introduce myself first. I'm the author of a book called Final Judgment. Have you ever heard of it?\" He shook his head in the negative as he was r unning the title through his mind. I didn't tell him that I had sent a copy to his office (which I had). I didn't want to waste any of my allotted 22 seconds of his time. I pressed on. \"The book documents the role of a Middle Eastern nation that has a very powerful lobby here in Washington in the assassination of your uncle.\" (I wasn't going to say the word \"Israel.\") Kennedy's eyes"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"532 The Continuing Cover - Up [435] flashed as if to say, \"Here we go again.\" I saw his reaction and concluded by saying, \"I think you should know, frankly, tha t a lot of people who are interested in the JFK assassination are taking this book very seriously.\" I stepped back. I saw that he was uncomfortable with the nature of what I was suggesting — that is, Israeli involvement — and I didn't want him to think that I was one of those people who would continue to occupy his space. I wanted him to see that I wasn't going to push the matter further. I was a complete stranger to him and for all he knew I could have been someone trying to bait him into making one of the ant i - Jewish statements for which his father, in particular, was well known (at least in private). In any case, as I stepped away, Congressman Kennedy responded, saying, \"Well, I hope that's not true.\" (A diplomatic response, if ever there was one.) I smiled, nodded my head and gave him a friendly wave and a salute good - bye as to say \"thanks for your time.\" Did Kennedy mean that he hoped it wasn't true that Israel had a hand in his uncle's assassination or did he mean that he hoped people weren't taking my thes is seriously — or both? In the end, of course, it doesn't really matter since only Congressman Kennedy knows for sure what he meant. However, the fact is that I can now state with certainty that the Kennedy family does indeed know about Final Judgment. I hav e no doubt that one way or another both of these young congressmen will someday discuss the allegations made in Final Judgment with their family. But what the family does with the information remains to be seen. If anything, the Kennedy family has been fir mly co - opted by the Mossad itself. The key to understanding this is Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' ten year relationship — prior to her death — with the enigmatic Belgian - born Jewish diamond merchant Maurice Tempelsman. After positioning himself as a permanent fi xture in the center of Jacqueline's life — and then ensconcing himself as her live - in companion in the Kennedy widow's elegant Manhattan penthouse — Tempelsman reportedly doubled (perhaps even tripled, by some accounts) Jacqueline's already substantial fortune . Although, upon her death, the major media dramatized the romance of Jacqueline and her companion, the media never once reported Tempelsman's long - time role as an international agent - in - place, operating in and out of Africa for the Israeli Mossad and its allies in the CIA. So it was that during Jacqueline's final days, Israel's Mossad was represented in the most intimate circles of the Kennedy family. However, it now seems — according to Edward Klein, writing in his new book, The Kennedy Curse, that after Ja cqueline's death, young JFK Jr. ordered Templesman out of the apartment he shared with Mrs. Onassis. Evidently young John was not so enamored of the international intriguer who, it is said, had warned \"John John\" about the dangers of flying. Ironically, in the end, perhaps, it doesn't really matter to the Kennedy family who was ultimately behind the assassination of the president and his"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"[436] Final Judgment 533 brother. Two family members died violently and tragically, whoever was responsible. The family's loss was all too perso nal, far beyond any other international geopolitical ramifications that were very much of interest to the conspirators responsible for the two assassinations. Pursuing the truth about what really happened was never an option. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy himself is probably lucky to still be alive, but he never achieved his dream of reclaiming the White House for the Kennedy dynasty. The likelihood that any other future family member will once again occupy the Oval Office is scant, at best. Congressman Joe Kenned y's plan to run for governor of Massachusetts was scuttled early on following a heavy - handed media campaign against him. His personal problems, stemming from a conflict with his ex - wife who wrote a much - publicized book about their marriage, coupled with al legations of his younger brother having had extra - marital relations with a teen - aged girl, were bandied about by the media and Kennedy was forced to withdraw from the race. At one point after Kennedy was forced out of the race, Steven Grossman, a Massachus etts printing tycoon who had been named national chairman of the Democratic Party, considered entering the race upon Kennedy's political demise, but Grossman suddenly changed his mind. In light of what I've documented in Final Judgment, it's probably worth noting that prior to becoming national chairman of the Democratic Party, Grossman had served as head of AIPAC, the registered lobby for Israel. It is probably only a coincidence, but an interesting one nonetheless. If truth be told, the Kennedy family has , in its own fashion, benefited immensely from the double tragedy, securing a place in history and legend that might otherwise have been lost had JFK lived out his term. But, as we have seen, the media has increasingly been coming down loud and hard on the heirs to the Kennedy legacy — and on JFK himself. THE MEDIA'S 'FINAL JUDGMENT' Writing in the Washington Post on November 25, 1993, famed economist Robert Samuelson deviated from his area of expertise and delved into the subject of the Kennedy legacy. His prominently placed column, appearing on the right - hand of the op - ed page was a full - tilt assault on the memory of John F. Kennedy, coming in the wake of the 30th anniversary of what may well have been the most stunning public event in our nation's history . \"We have come through another orgy of Kennedy remembrances,\" complained Samuelson, \"and I confess that, finally, I am fed up. It is not just that his life and his assassination have been over dramatized, transforming him from a political figure into an e ntertainment phenomenon with a place in pop culture closer to Elvis than Harry Truman. The dissent"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"534 The Continuing Cover - Up [437] goes deeper. Our Kennedy obsession obscures something crucial. He was, at best, a mediocre president or, less charitably, a lousy one.\" 1094 Samuelson went on to blame Kennedy for the tragedy of the war in Vietnam. \"It was Kennedy who made the critical commitment to Vietnam. All the subsequent speculation about whether he would or wouldn't have increased that commitment, as Johnson did, is really irrelevant. We can never know what Kennedy would have done, only what he did. And what he did was make a major military (and political) commitment to a country whose survival was not a vital national interest, and thereby, involves us in a conflict that politically we could not sustain. Once this happened, there was no easy exit. Bad judgment.\" 1095 The opinionated columnist determined that JFK lacked \"wisdom or good instincts\" and that he did \"not have the background or values to make good decisions by himself.\" 1096 \"T he Kennedy who lives beyond the grave,\" concluded Samuelson, \"commands neither my sympathy nor my interest. He is simplified, romanticized and exploited. He is not a person but a popular delusion.\" 1097 So much for the memory of John F. Kennedy in the judgm ent of one of the nation's most respected opinion - makers. Perhaps, then, it should be no surprise that on November 22, 1994 — the 31st anniversary of the JFK assassination — the Washington Post, America's political newspaper of record, said not a single word i n commemoration of that tragic day. By November 22, 1997 — four years after Samuelson's harsh attack on John Kennedy — the big \"news\" of the day was the release of The Dark Side of Camelot, Seymour Hersh's book about the JFK years (discussed earlier in these p ages). Clearly, the new media thrust is to say that John F. Kennedy wasn't really such a great guy after all and that maybe, as Malcolm X said at the time of the JFK assassination, the chickens had come home to roost. ASKING FOR A DEBATE Just prior to th e release of the third edition of Final Judgment, I sent copies of the second edition to a number of individuals inviting them to debate the thesis of Final Judgment with me — on radio or in any public forum or in writing. I gave them the opportunity to refu te the book in the manner they wished. Not an unfair offer, I should think. Here are those who received copies of Final Judgment and the invitation to a debate: Jack Anderson - The syndicated columnist and international wheeler - dealer who has promoted a nu mber of conflicting theories about the JFK assassination, notably the myth that \"Castro Killed JFK.\" Robert Dornan - Then a GOP congressman from Orange County, California and a shrieking devotee of Israel, Dornan later joined his arch foe, Rep. Loretta San chez, in co - hosting a September 19, 1998 fund - raiser to"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"[438] Final Judgment 535 assist the ADL's scheme to oust Steve Frogue, the college trustee who had dared to invite me to speak in Orange County about Final Judgment. Jack Shafer - Then the editor of Washington, D.C.'s popul ar City Paper, a freewheeling, liberal - oriented \"alternative\" newspaper. John Loftus - Author of The Secret War Against the Jews, a new book which claims that anti - Israel partisans in the American intelligence community have sought to sabotage the state of Israel. (Loftus is a former attorney with the Nazi - hunting Office of Special Investigations.) Roland Pritikin - Retired Brigadier General and internationally - known physician and founder of the Center for Global Security, an ad hoc pro - Israel lobby group w hich included among its advisors Luis Kutner, a former attorney for Jack Ruby, and General Julius Klein, the American military officer who played a major role in the establishment of the Mossad. Bob Grant - The controversial broadcaster over WABC radio in New York who has often bragged of his friendly relations with the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith and of his deep devotion (that is obvious obsequious pandering) to the state of Israel. Rush Limbaugh - The biggest (and now fading) name in \"con servative\" talk radio known for being an outrageous and audacious critic of everything but Israel's misdeeds. Chuck Harder - Host of the widely - heard \"For the People\" radio program, Harder refuses to mention the role of Israel in international misdeeds, al though he is quick to find conspiracy and corruption of other sorts under almost every rock. G. Gordon Liddy - The former CIA and FBI operative who was brave enough to stand up to a federal judge and go to prison for refusing to rat on his friends. Once fr equently accused of being a Nazi sympathizer, Liddy is now a popular radio broadcaster — but never a critic of Israel. William F. Jasper - Senior Editor of the John Birch Society's New American magazine which is a steadfast backer of the state of Israel and still enamored of Mossad - allied CIA man James Jesus Angleton's fantasy/cover story that \"The Soviets Killed JFK.\" David Scheim - Author of Contract on America, which claims that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" and ignores the integral role of Israeli loyalist and C IA collaborator Meyer Lansky in the international crime syndicate. Scheim has been a major figure in the community of JFK assassination \"researchers\" but, as we've noted in these pages, he refuses to acknowledge even the possibility of CIA involvement in t he crime. Jack Newfield - The liberal columnist for the New York Post, Newfield, an Israeli loyalist, has claimed that missing Teamster's Union boss Jimmy Hoffa was the prime mover behind the JFK assassination. Issuing a call for a debate was not a search for publicity for Final Judgment — although any publicity would have been welcome and actually quite remarkable. What I earnestly sought was for some individual to come"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"536 The Continuing Cover - Up [439] forth and prove me wrong — to show me where the conclusions reached in Final Judgment wer e unsound. Of this vast array of individuals invited to debate only General Pritikin had responded as of January 1, 1998. Pritikin's lengthy letter said that \"Every statement in your book can be refuted, but I am not the one to do it.\" 1098 Pritikin told me that General Mark Clark said that \"I wouldn't be surprised if thirty or forty years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy books will come out blaming the Jews.\" 1099 \"Your book\" wrote Pritikin, \"along with the writings of Grace Halsell and George Ba ll (who had a long record of treason) are considered [by the Arabs] the tryptych for the destruction of the USA and the extermination of the American people.\" 1100 (Grace Halsell is a longtime and respected professional journalist of liberal inclinations wh o has written somewhat critically of Israel. Former Undersecretary of State George Ball is guilty of the same crime. Evidently Halsell, Ball and I are guilty of crimes of the same magnitude as far as General Pritikin is concerned.) \"You state in your lette r,\" wrote Pritikin, \"that no one has come forward to refute the allegations in your book. This is due to the fact that it has no index. It is written in the style of Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas. It reads like a beautiful, fictional novel because it has no index. That is why no one has come forward to refute anything. \"1101 (The first two editions of Final Judgment were not indexed.] Pritikin continued: \"The discovery of oil in the Arabian Peninsula in the 1930s brought about the downfall of free western civilization, because the USA failed to have the foresight, the courage and the adamant will to combat the oil rich sheiks, and because we had traitors like Michael Collins Piper, Grace Halsell and George Ball.\" 1102 PRITIKIN'S 'PROOF' In his letter Gene ral Pritikin cited the presence of a lovely memorial in Israel to John F. Kennedy as \"proof' that the Israelis loved JFK more than any other American president. This is scant \"proof' indeed — of nothing. A cynic might be so crass as to suggest that the memor ial was nothing more than a tribute by the Israelis to one of their own more outrageous public executions and the skill with which it was conducted. Lest, however, that some pro - Israel zealot claim that this is my contention, for the record I will say that it is not. What I am saying is that such a memorial proves nothing: Only that the Mossad - dominated Israeli establishment wants to have it on the record — although the facts show otherwise — that \"Israel loved JFK.\" Perhaps the average man in the street in Tel Aviv did indeed admire John F. Kennedy. But Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion, Mossad"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"[440] Final Judgment 537 assassinations chief Yitzhak Shamir and their allies in the CIA and in the Lansky Crime Syndicate did not. Be all of this as it may, I can only conclude that the refusal by these \"big names\" to either debate me publicly or to attempt to repudiate my work in any way, shape or form is precisely because they cannot. Final Judgment is thus, in my view, for all intents and purposes, the final judgment on what really happened i n Dallas. I have indeed secured, as I've said, a default judgment simply because no one has stepped forth to answer my charges. \"CERTAIN DOCTRINES OF THE FAITH\" Although esteemed maverick linguist Noam Chomsky has riled Israel with his criticisms of its international misdeeds, Chomsky himself refuses to become embroiled in any debate about the JFK assassination whatsoever. In fact, Chomsky has described the unending flow of letters he's received on the subject, pointing out that he's been forced to resort to a form letter outlining the reasons why he will not discuss the subject. But Chomsky, as a critic of Israel, recognizes how public debate over controversial issues has been impacted by the media and the academic community. In an introduction to one vol ume exposing Israeli intrigue, Chomsky wrote: History, particularly recent history, is characteristically presented to the general public within the framework of a doctrinal system based on certain fundamental dogmas. In the case of the totalitarian societ ies, the point is too obvious to require comment. The situation is more intriguing in societies that lack cruder forms of repression and ideological control. The United States, for example, is surely one of the least repressive societies of past or present history with respect to freedom of inquiry and expression. Yet only rarely will an analysis of crucial historical events reach a wide audience unless it conforms to certain doctrines of the faith . . . 1103 The doctrines of the faith — in the case of the JF K assassination debate — are quite restrictive: in short, there is no debate. The case is closed. Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. There was no conspiracy. Anyone who says that there was a conspiracy is — God forbid — a \"conspiracy theorist\" and anyone who believe s in conspiracy theories might potentially be the kind of person who would blow up a federal building in Oklahoma City and murder 168 innocent men, women and children. That is precisely the argument put forth in the \"mainstream\" media following that traged y. The argument went like this: the militia movement influenced Timothy McVeigh. The militias believe in conspiracy theories. Tim McVeigh blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City. Therefore, if you believe in conspiracy theories, you're bad. You're ag ainst the government. You're against America. You support the terrible things that McVeigh did in Oklahoma. Don't believe in conspiracy theories — and that includes the theory that there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"538 The Continuing Cover - Up [4 41] That doesn't make any logical sense, of course, but that is precisely what the mainstream media seeks to convey and it has become a constant drumbeat. Conspiracy theories are simply \"bad.\" And if you believe in them, you're the kind of person who might consider blowing up a fed eral building in Oklahoma City or elsewhere. Chomsky, in his own inimitable style, continues: To accept the dogma, a person who is unable to tolerate more than a limited degree of internal contradiction must studiously avoid the documentary record, which is ample in a free society . . . 1104 In the case of Final Judgment, of course, those who wish to accept the official dogma and reject findings put forth in Final Judgment must ignore all of the evidence (published long before this book ever came into bein g) that suggests not only: a) that Israel did have a motive to participate in the JFK assassination conspiracy; and b) that there are multiple Israeli connections to the conspiracy that can indeed be documented. Chomsky: Within the scholarly professions an d the media, the intelligentsia can generally be counted on to close ranks; they will refuse to submit to critical analysis the doctrines of the faith, prune the historical and documentary record so as to insulate these doctrines from examination, and proc eed to present a version of history that is safely free from institutional critique or analysis. 1105 The media has indeed played a part in the cover - up of the findings laid forth in Final Judgment. Although the book has now received some publicity as a r esult of the ADL's effort to prevent me from speaking at the community college seminar in Orange County, the media reports that did appear were intertwined with the allegation that I was some sort of \"Holocaust denier\" and therefore not credible. Likewise, so - called \"scholars\" such as Professor Roy Bauer at the Irvine Valley College refused to give me the opportunity to present my case. Bauer would not allow the doctrines of the faith to be submitted to critical analysis. Chomsky: Occasional departures from orthodoxy are of little moment as long as they are confined to narrow circles that can be ignored, or dismissed as 'irresponsible' or 'naive' or 'failing to comprehend the complexities of history,' or otherwise identified with familiar code words as beyon d the pale . . . 1106 Final Judgment was a departure from orthodoxy and it was dismissed with \"code words\" (such as \"anti - Semitism\") and described — in fact — as being \"beyond the pale.\" However, because Final Judgment had suddenly had the opportunity to be h eard by an academic audience — rather than among a select list of book buyers who had access to the volume — the defenders of the doctrines of the faith erupted into a frenzy. Chomsky:"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"[442] Final Judgment 539 With rare exceptions, one must adopt certain doctrines of the faith to en ter the arena of debate — at least before any substantial segment of the public . . . 1107 In the case of the debate over the JFK assassination, one of the new \"certain doctrines of the faith\" that must be accepted in order \"to enter the arena of the debate\" is that — under no circumstances — can one suggest any of the following: 1) that Israel had reason to be hostile to John F. Kennedy. 2) that U.S. Middle East policy did a 180 - degree turnabout upon the death of John F. Kennedy; 3) that Israel's Mossad had any role w hatsoever — any role at all — in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. You can believe that there was some sort of \"flying saucer connection.\" Or that Nazis did it. Or, most popularly, that the Mafia killed JFK. You can even say that a few \"rogue\" CIA types we re involved. But don't ever say anything about Israel and the Mossad. That's when you become \"irresponsible\" and go \"beyond the pale.\" Don't do it! If you do, they'll call you an \"anti - Semite\" — or maybe even a \"Holocaust denier,\" which is evidently now the latest gimmick in the ongoing effort to silence those (such as myself) who have dared publicly pinpoint the role of Israel in the crime of the century. It's something that just apparently may not be done. A 'REAL HISTORY' OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION? The Wa shington Post — always a defender of the interests of the CIA and its allies in the Mossad — recently provided its readers with a hint that, perhaps, there will ultimately be an \"official\" popular determination — a \"consensus\" — as to the \"real history of the Kenn edy assassination.\"'\" That is, a \"history\" that satisfies virtually everybody. In other words, the real truth about who killed John F. Kennedy — and why — be damned. In promoting this presumably forthcoming \"real history,\" the Post published a remarkably revea ling \"think piece\" by one of its staff editors, Jefferson Morley, in which young Morley opined that \"we are closer than ever to having a firm factual basis for an assassination consensus.\" 1109 Morley, in fact, is not so much concerned with finding out who was responsible for the assassination of the American president, but, instead, is more concerned with restoring the faith of the American people in the very government whose intelligence agency — the CIA — played a central role in the assassination and its co ver - up. According to Morley, \"The Kennedy assassination is a factor in the crisis of legitimacy that now undermines the U.S. government's ability to address a wide variety of public ills. The inability of the government to present a credible explanation of how Kennedy was killed is not the only nor the most important reason for the decline. But it surely has played a role. Reaching a common understanding"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"540 The Continuing Cove r - Up [443] about the causal chain of events leading to Kennedy's murder would be an important symbolic step towar d restoring faith in American democracy. \"1110 Morley says that \"We should not [Morley's emphasis] bother to reach a consensus out of fear that hypothetical persons complicit in President Kennedy's murder are a menace to democracy today. This is the paranoi d position . . . \"1111 (In other words, anyone who seeks to point a finger of blame — at this late date — is a trouble - making lunatic conspiracy theorist and therefore a menace to democracy.) While Morley concedes that there is evidence that the conspiracy beh ind the JFK assassination was larger than one \"lone nut,\" 1112 he also suggests that the most important goal is not determining who really killed John F. Kennedy, but, instead, realizing that the controversy over the assassination stemmed from \"the governme nt's secrecy about the assassination and its investigatory aftermath.\" 1113 This secrecy, he claims correctly, was wrong, but he says that \"the shroud of secrecy is finally being lifted 111 4 by JFK Assassinations Record Review Board. Now, according to Morle y, the work of the review board, effectively makes any \"polemics [about who was behind the assassination] passe.\" 1115 Morley admits \"that the most likely explanation for the cause of Kennedy's death lies in his policies,\" (and he's certainly right on that one) but Morley adds that in seeking a \"consensus\" that \"we should not scapegoat any persons, groups, political creeds or institutions.\" 1116 (In other words, no person or institution — such as the CIA or the Mossad — should ultimately be held responsible for t he crime.) Adding, that \"we need to respect the complexity of history,\" 1117 Morley says that \"the grounds for consensus are now emerging,\" and that \"the story of the Kennedy assassination and the mystery that surrounded it is not a saga of an immense and m onolithic conspiracy. Nor is it simply the tale of a lone nut. Rather it is a chapter in the history of the Cold War, a cautionary tale for the next generations about the perils of secrecy in a democracy. \"1118 Thus, according to Morley, the real problem is government secrecy. The big question is not who really killed John F. Kennedy — and why. In Morley's skewed perception, it seems, it really doesn't matter in the end why John F. Kennedy was assassinated or who was responsible. The gravest matter of concern is restoring the faith of Americans in their government. I don't agree with Jefferson Morley and the Washington Post — nor do most Americans. Americans are, in the words of Noam Chomsky, \"those who are interested in discovering the real world that lies behin d 'official history \"1119 and not interested in the kind of artificial \"consensus\" being touted by the Washington Post. And it is this kind of new approach to the JFK assassination that we must ponder as we consider the way that the truth about the assassin ation is treated by the media and about the way the facts and the so - called facts will be released to the public."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"[444] Final Judgment 541 SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS . . . Those who are ostensibly seeking the truth about the murder of President Kennedy but who continue to ignore t he very clear role played by Israel and its Mossad in the assassination are perhaps, in the end, the greatest enemies of the truth. If I am wrong about Mossad involvement, I ask my critics to show me where I'm wrong. If even JFK's admirers are unable to fa ce the truth and expose it to the light of day, then America and the world face a very grave crisis indeed. Frankly, I do find it frustrating — but I understand why — that others have steered clear of that one controversial area of research that is so central to divining the truth about the murder of President Kennedy. After all, as recently as November 28, 2003 — the influential Jewish community newspaper, Forward, \"celebrated\" the 40 th anniversary of the assassination by trying to refute \"conspiracy theories\" — particularly that presented in Final Judgment, which Forward described as being \"more sinister\" 1120 than any other. I have no regrets whatsoever about having made the decision to write the book. A few people have suggested I should have appended a nom de plume upon the volume so I would be protected from the inevitable cries of outrage that followed. However, had I done so, I would not have been able to publicly defend my own work if I chose to hide behind a pen name. In the end, I believe that I have put together a volume that does make sense and one that most open - minded people, once they have read the book, will agree puts forth a thesis that does make sense. Most of those — probably all — who have attacked the book have not read it. They have preferred to s tand on the sidelines and attack the thesis, but not the evidence that backs it up. The facts in the record do speak for themselves. I am sorry those facts upset so many. It is my hope that Final Judgment will, in some way, contribute to a full understandi ng of not only the death of John F. Kennedy, but also of all of the world - shaking events that followed — events that changed history. More importantly, though, I hope we have all learned some lessons as a result and that the American people will take whateve r action is necessary to right this great wrong. — MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"Postscript A senior French diplomat, Bernard Ledun, died in Paris on February 1, 1994. His sudden death at age 50 — ostensibly fro m a heart attack — may be another of the \"convenient\" deaths that have occurred in the wake of the JFK assassination and its cover - up and a direct consequence of the announcement, on November 22, 1993, of the impending release of the first edition of Final J udgment. Ledun had been privy to \"inside\" information which confirmed the high - level intelligence status of the French source — quoted in Chapter 16 of Final Judgment — who provided this author information which establishes that the much - discussed \"French conn ection\" to the Kennedy assassination is, in fact, misnamed and is, instead, the Israeli connection. Just prior to his sudden death, Ledun, a career officer in the French diplomatic corps, was scheduled to become Consul General for France in Johannesburg, S outh Africa. From October 1989 to December 1993 he served as Consul General for his native country in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. While posted in Vancouver, Ledun committed a grievous — albeit honest — mistake that may have sealed his own fate. His un witting action proved the high - level French intelligence status of the source, quoted in Final Judgment. The source — Pierre Neuville — asserted (based on his own inside knowledge) that Israel's secret service, the Mossad, utilized connections in French intell igence, in arranging the hiring of an assassin or assassins who were involved in the execution of President Kennedy. In 1976, while serving in the French consulate in Vancouver, Canada, Ledun released copies of internal French intelligence documents to Pie rre confirming that Pierre had indeed been a French intelligence officer privy to explosive state secrets. Because of the incendiary nature of the information to which Pierre had been privy, French intelligence had denied for years that Pierre was engaged in intelligence work for his native country. The release of the documents by Ledun, however, provided hard evidence to the contrary. Not only had Pierre learned specific details about how French intelligence had been manipulated by the Mossad in the JFK as sassination conspiracy — information provided by his own allies in French intelligence — but Pierre himself had been brought into a previous assassination conspiracy conducted jointly by the Mossad and French intelligence. The Mossad had contracted — through its key contact in French intelligence, Colonel Georges deLannurien — to arrange for Pierre to unwittingly play the role of \"patsy\" (a la Lee Harvey Oswald) in a Mossad plot to kill Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser during the last week of October, 1956, ju st prior to the invasion at Port Said during the Suez Crisis."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"[446] Final Judgment 543 (It was deLannurien, as we noted in Chapter 16, who was later the primary conduit between the Yitzhak Shamir of the Mossad and James J. Angleton of the CIA in the JFK assassination conspiracy. ) When Pierre realized that he, in fact, was the intended patsy in the Nasser assassination plot, he surrendered to Egyptian intelligence at Cairo International Airport. For refusing to give up his life in a Mossad - sponsored conspiracy, Pierre — the scion of a distinguished family and son of the renowned French diplomat, Rene Neuville, head of the Consulate General of France in Jerusalem until his death in 1952 — became a man without a country. After fleeing to South America and then to Canada, Pierre was tried in absentia by a French military court and convicted of \"treason\" and \"breach of external security of the state\" and condemned to 24 years of forced labor. When, in 1976, still in exile, Pierre sought clemency by approaching the French consul general's of fice in Vancouver, Canada, where he was then living, his request was rejected. At that time, in a document dated \"5 OCT 1976\" the French Ministry of Defense advised the French Consul General in Vancouver that Pierre's request had been denied. It was Bernar d Ledun at the French Consul General's office who released this letter of denial to Pierre, not realizing the explosive nature of the document. As Pierre says, French intelligence was \"furious with this gaffe of Mr. Ledun, an act very treasonable, that of giving to outsiders a letter of the minister of Defense giving credit to my allegations that I had been a diplomat and intelligence officer serving France in Libya and Italy. \"You may argue,\" Pierre acknowledges, \"that this letter does not prove that I ser ved the French Government. Well, where did you see a simple French citizen being accused of Treason and \"atteinte a la surete de l'Etat,\" condemned to the terrible sentence of 20 years of hard labor? \"Only if you believe in Santa,\" comments Pierre, \"could you believe that anyone may be guilty of such horrendous 'crimes' without having knowledge of State secrets. And by the way, \"atteinte a la surete de l'Etat\" means, in good English 'trying to overthrow the State by a subversive act.' \"It supposes that I ha d the power to betray and harm the French State in the period referred to. That is, in the 1950's. That's credit indeed towards my allegations. And this is why Mr. Ledun had to pay the price of his mistake by death. Pierre contends: \"Mr. Ledun was murdered in Paris by French intelligence on February 1, 1994. He gave me the weapon by which I can sustain my allegations. If once I was convicted of 'treason,' why not a second time? \"Without this letter, French intelligence would answer to your allegations in Fi nal Judgment that they never heard of me, that I am an imposter or some kind of nut, lunatic, crank or else. But this damned letter"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"544 Postscript [447] is in your hands. So if you decide to ask more questions now, they may tell you that I am a 'poor son of a bitch.' Yes! \"P lease pray for the soul of Mr. Ledun who was a true gentleman — the first victim of Final Judgment. \"I thank you so for Final Judgment,\" Pierre told this author in a letter. \"Your book is justice done. I may now die in peace. As Dag Hammarskjold, the late UN Secretary General commented, 'The truth is so simple that it is regarded as pretentious banality.' \" Pierre believes, beyond question, that Ledun was, in fact, murdered in retribution for his mistake in light of the forthcoming release of Final Judgment. Here's why . . . You see, the first public announcement of the allegations appearing in Final Judgment came in a special full - page advertisement published on November 22, 1993 in Dallas, Texas in the program of the annual symposium conducted by the JFK Ass assination Information Center. The announcement revealed that Final Judgment had relied, in part, upon a French source for information detailing the Israeli Mossad connection to the JFK assassination and the French intelligence role therein. Pierre believe s that this announcement tipped off the Mossad and French intelligence that he was the source referenced in Final Judgment. As a consequence, Ledun's murder was an act of retribution against Ledun for his mistake of many years earlier — that is, confirming t hat Pierre had indeed been involved (however unwittingly) in a sensitive and high - level joint collaborative effort between the Mossad and French intelligence. Had Pierre not courageously spoken out, filling in the missing link in the JFK assassination cons piracy, Bernard Ledun might indeed have lived out the rest of his natural life in peace . . . but the truth about the Kennedy assassination might never have been told. Pierre Neuville can rest assured that he played a major role in helping resolve the grea test mystery of our modern era: the question of who really orchestrated the death of John F. Kennedy — and why. — M ICH AEL CO LLI NS P IP ER"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Bibliography Adelson, Alan. The Ruby - Oswald Affair. Seattle, Washington: Romar Books, Ltd., 1988. Agnew, Spiro T.

END OF REFERENCE NOTES"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"[494] Final Judgment 591 Regarding the Sources: Lest it be said by any of my critics that I have \"failed to footnote some quotations,\" I will point out that there are a handful of direct quotations that appear in the book that are not footnoted per se, but are clearly cited as to the source within the text of the book itself. In light of outrageous and malicious (and, I must say, fruitless) efforts to refute previous editions of Final Judgment — in particul ar the egregious smears and misrepresentations and distortions by an agenda - driven clique at the Schaumburg, Illinois Library, a pathetic \"team\" led by an Israeli, Uri Toch — I feel compelled to make notations such as this. (The aforementioned Shaumburg affa ir is described in some detail in the subsequent concluding section of this book — \"Final Word?\" — which, as the title suggests, indicates that there is probably much more, ultimately, that can be said about the thesis presented in Final Judgment. In addition, in the question and answer section — entitled \"Default Judgment\" — I address a number of specific allegations by a handful of critics who have alleged (falsely) that my thesis is founded on having relied upon \"biased\" or \"extremist\" or \"anti - Israel\" sources. As any honest reader can see, by simply referring to the reference notes and the bibliography, there is absolutely no way that my critics can contend that Final Judgment is founded (even marginally) on sources \"outside the mainstream,\" claims by my critics notwithstanding. And as I note in the \"Challenge to the Readers\" that appears in the final pages of Final Judgment, I am eagerly inviting my critics to show where I have misrepresented or misinterpreted or misquoted the writings of others. Thus far, no on e has been able to do it. However, as you will see, my agenda - driven critics at the Schaumburg Library managed not only to misquote not just me but also other writers, as well as distort what others (and I) had written.

On the one hand, it's a play on the title of Final Judgment, with all due credit to Mark Lane whose Rush to Judgment, was the first major work to explode the Warren Commission Report. On the other hand, however, it is critical to understand precisely what a \"default judgment\" is in order to appreciate the irony of the title: A default judgment is what is issued in one's favor in a court of law when the oppo sition fails to appear in court to defend itself against your allegations. I believe that I have essentially won a default judgment in the JFK assassination conspiracy case. Here's why: In Final Judgment I believe that I painted a complete picture which e ssentially tied all of the most commonly accepted JFK assassination conspiracy theories together in a tightly knit format that explained how and why the conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy evolved and precisely who was behind it. More than 25,000 copies of Final Judgment are now in circulation throughout the United States (and around the world) yet not one person has yet come forward to refute in any way any single fact relating to my theory as it appears in Final Judgment. So I do feel that I've won an un - c ontested \"default judgment\" in the JFK case and that the basic thesis of the book has been confirmed, not only because no one has been able to refute it, but, more importantly, because the several lame attempts to refute the book have failed. Now I'm tryin g to answer many of the questions and comments and a few criticisms that have come to me from many, many readers. I'm pleased to say that of several hundred cards, calls and letters that I received from readers there was absolutely only one who said that t hey didn't like the book and that person's complaint was that he said that he considered my writing \"sophomoric.\" But he didn't have any substantive criticism of the contents of the book itself. Frankly, it seemed to me that the person just wanted to compl ain. One other individual, the very well known newspaper columnist Sam Francis told somebody that although Final Judgment contained what he called \"much valuable information,\" that he still believed that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the JFK assassinati on. (I won't comment on that.) All in all, I was pleased by the number of intriguing and thought - provoking questions that were addressed to me by my readers. Often they had very pointed questions, asking why I didn't make reference to some matter or anothe r or why I passed by some subject that they felt deserved further discussion. In Default Judgment, now being published in an updated and revised format as a supplement to Final Judgment, many of the questions addressed are just as they came directly to me from readers of Final Judgment. In other instances we have combined a number of related inquiries coming"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"[498] Final Judgment 594 from different sources. And it is interesting to point out that many, many people had precisely the same interests addressed in their questions. Alth ough there is no particular order in which the questions and answers appear in these pages, we've tried to categorize the questions in a free - flowing fashion that leads logically from one subject to another. The questions cover a broad range of subject mat ter and are arranged in such a fashion that even someone who has not actually read Final Judgment will be able to understand the subject matter without having first read Final Judgment, although needless to say I do suggest that before reading this materia l that the reader first refer to Final Judgment. I think that people will find the material enlightening and that it gives the readers new insights into various aspects of the JFK assassination controversy. If I've missed anything, I hope people will feel free to write me and ask me to address those questions that they might have. I believe that Final Judgment does stand on its own as, at least for now, the last word on the JFK assassination but I also believe that Default Judgment helps bring into focus so me of the gray areas that people may have questions about. So, yes, I believe that there has been a default judgment entered in favor of Final Judgment. — MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"595 Questions & Answers [499] What follows are questio ns addressed to Michael Collins Piper, author of Final Judgment, and his responses to those questions. The questions focus on both a wide variety of matters discussed or subjects otherwise not mentioned — in the pages of Final Judgment. The questions appear in boldface text. Piper's responses are in regular text. How did you first come up with the theory that the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad, had a hand in the assassination of President Kennedy? That's a highly controversial allegation considerin g all of the other theories that have been presented. How did you come about researching and writing this book? That's not a simple question to answer for the reason that the process of developing the idea for the book was something that I suppose, ranged from the very beginning of the time that I began reading about the JFK assassination as a grade school student in the late 1960's. I've touched on various aspects of the answer to this question in the pages of Final Judgment, but since so many people have still asked this question, I will elaborate further and perhaps provide some new insights to readers. As anyone who is even vaguely familiar with the subject is well aware, there have been literally thousands of books written on the subject. I've probably read about 100 of them at the most. I do have an extensive personal library on the subject (and on many other matters as well, in particular, I might note, U.S. Middle East policy) and I've read many of the JFK books many, many times over the years and, i n the process, absorbed the primary details. I do recall that at some point while I was in college and was discussing the JFK assassination with my mother (who was very well read on the subject herself) and she said: \"Why don't you write a book on it?\" I r esponded: \"Well, that would basically be a waste of time. There's very little new information to write about. The books have already essentially been written.\" (Little did I know what I would later discover!) At any rate, it was essentially, however, aroun d the time of 1992 that my interest in the assassination was beginning to develop more extensively, largely because of the fact that The Spotlight, the newspaper by which I had been employed for a decade, had been involved in the E. Howard Hunt libel trial . In 1991 Mark Lane's book, Plausible Denial, had been released and that was the book that outlined the circumstances of the Hunt libel case involving The Spotlight and this was also the time that Oliver Stone's film, JFK, was in the process of being made and released. Consequently there was a newly revived and reinvigorated interest in the JFK assassination. As I read Mark Lane's book, which focuses on the CIA's role in the assassination of President Kennedy, it became clear to me that one of the"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"[500] Final Judgment 596 primary high - level CIA players behind the scenes in manipulating events which made it appear that the president's alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was perhaps some sort of \"pro - Castro agitator\" with ties to the S o v i e t s , w a s J a m e s J e s u s A n g l e t o n , t h e C I A ' s d i r e c t o r o f counterintelligence. Angleton was not only the number three man in the CIA and one of its veterans, but he was, more importantly, in our context, very close to the Israeli Mossad as a consequence of his role as the very jealous guardian of the CIA 's Mossad desk. This is information that has long been in the public domain. Angleton's ties to the Mossad were no real surprise. However, the very fact that Angleton was the central player in the CIA's relationship to the circumstances surrounding the JFK assassination was interesting to me, inasmuch as over the years although there has been a lot of research and inquiry into what one might call \"who's who in the JFK assassination?\" and the conspiracy and cover - up, Angleton's prominent role had never been given the scrutiny it certainly deserved. He is mentioned in some (but not all) of the books on the subject, but generally only in passing. In fact, Angleton is only looked upon as some sort of \"right wing anti communist\" who was involved in the CIA. Paren thetically, I might note that a lot of the JFK assassination researchers who have looked into the CIA's intrigue in relation to the assassination seem to have this desire to deny any institutional involvement by the CIA and present those conspirators from the CIA or who were linked to the CIA and who were involved in the assassination, as somehow being \"rogue elements.\" However, as Lane showed in Plausible Denial and as I think I firmly amplified upon in Final Judgment, these CIA figures were working instit utionally. They weren't \"rogue elements\" but were working on behalf of the CIA itself, in collaboration with the Israeli Mossad and elements of organized crime, to both of which they had long been intimately tied. In any case, Plausible Denial cemented in my own mind the fact that the CIA player — in this instance, Angleton — who was involved in the assassination conspiracy was, in fact, the Mossad's key man at the CIA. Now during this same time frame there were other things that started me looking further in t he direction of the Mossad. I have to give credit where credit is due. The Lyndon LaRouche organization's journal, Executive Intelligence Review, had issued a thoroughly documented book entitled Dope, Inc. in the mid - 1980's and in that volume they did focu s on the role of the Permindex corporation on whose board of directors Clay Shaw served. Shaw was the New Orleans trade executive whom New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison charged with involvement in the assassination conspiracy. The Shaw - Garrison tr ial was, needless to say, the focus of Oliver Stone's JFK film. In Dope, Inc., the editors highlighted the fact that two of the prime movers behind this secretive corporation, Permindex, were Major Louis M. Bloomfield and Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum."},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"597 Questions & Answers [501] However, frankly, I must admit that although I had read Dope, Inc., it was never clear to me as to precisely why the Israelis, per se, would have an interest in becoming involved in a plot to assassinate JFK. Now here's a note of criticism for Dope, Inc.: in the bo ok the editors state that the Israeli Mossad is essentially nothing more than a tool of British intelligence and that it was British intelligence that was responsible for the murder of President Kennedy. I don't agree with this assessment, but this is not to suggest that the LaRouche organization is not a reliable source. In fact many different people (including their critics) have acknowledged the outstanding and extensive research done by the LaRouche people, even if the critics don't necessarily agree wi th the LaRouche organization's particular conclusions. As far as the material relating to Permindex is concerned, the LaRouche organization relied largely on materials already published in the European press, so the material was not anything out of the ord inary by any means. However, Dope, Inc. never examines JFK's Middle East policy which, of course, would be the primary interest of the Israelis in their national context, and which, at the same time, would explain the interest of Bloomfield and Rosenbaum i n being involved in the conspiracy to assist the financing and orchestration of the JFK assassination. I must also take note of a recorded monologue by one Dr. John Coleman who says that he is a former British intelligence agent. Coleman claimed in his rep ort that, as he put it, \"Zionism\" was behind the JFK assassination and he essentially echoed the Permindex connections between Bloomfield, Shaw, Permindex, etc that had already been documented. However, in certain respects Dr. Coleman was actually incorrec t in some of his \"facts\" regarding the JFK assassination. So I was familiar with his work, but I hasten to point out that he never explained why, as he puts it, \"Zionism,\" would have reason to remove JFK from the White House. So, you see, there has been so me literary basis for the allegations that I put forth in Final Judgment (and, I think, tied together in a nice neat package that makes sense) but these allegations have been buried in a hodge - podge of other material. Frankly, I am surprised that no one pr ior to myself had picked up on this other research. There was another item I came across that intrigued me for a long time. It appeared in Paris Flammonde's The Kennedy Conspiracy, a highly sympathetic and thoroughly fascinating account of Jim Garrison's i nvestigation of Clay Shaw. In that book, Flammonde points out that the primary individual involved in the liquidation of Permindex and its relocation from Rome, Italy to South Africa was Dr. David Biegun. Biegun was described as a \"high - level financial bac ker\" of Permindex and was the national secretary of the National Committee for Labor Israel in New York. So here's another key figure in the Israeli network who was a key figure in the Permindex operation. Now there again this fact was noted in the book Co up d'etat in America by A. J. Weberman and Michael Canfield. They point out that former CIA officer Philip Agee has described the National Committee for Labor Israel as some sort of CIA proprietary."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"[502] Final Judgment 598 That's all well and good, but the fact is that there is a very distinct Israeli connection here. In reference to Weberman and Canfield, it's probably worth noting (as I point out in Final Judgment) that they were the source of perhaps the thing that I found the most intriguing of all — and indeed, the first real reference to any suggestion that somehow there was a \"Jewish connection,\" so to speak, to the JFK assassination. I refer to their statement in their book that \"After the assassination, an informer for the Secret Service and the FBI who had infiltrated a C uban exile group and was in the process of selling them machine guns reported that on November 21, 1963 he was told, 'We now have plenty of money — our new backers are the Jews — as soon as they take care of JFK.' This man had furnished reliable information in the past.\" This was the first time ever that I had seen anything suggesting that \"the Jews\" were involved in the JFK assassination. I read this particular book and this quotation for the first time in 1978 (well before I ever heard of the research appeari ng in Dope, Inc. or any of the allegations by Dr. John Coleman, among others.). Then, time and again, over the subsequent years, as I leafed through and re - read Coup d'etat in America, the meaning and impact of this unusual reference began to come into foc us as I explored all of the different facets of not only the JFK assassination but all of the different forces that were aligned against the American president at the time of his murder. Obviously it wasn't a \"Jewish plot\" to assassinate JFK, but I did, of course, ultimately come to realize that there was indeed an Israeli connection to the murder involving highly - placed individuals who happened to be Jewish and who were interested in furthering the conspiracy to advance the interests of the Jewish state. M any of the more naive and perhaps \"liberal\" of the JFK assassination researchers (particularly those who never explored JFK's Middle East policy, which put him at loggerheads with Israel) would no doubt have been flustered and puzzled by the suggestion tha t \"the Jews\" would have any desire to \"whack\" John F. Kennedy. After all, as even one of my young critics said, \"Why would the Jews want to kill John F. Kennedy? They voted for him in 1960.\" I told him: \"Read Final Judgment. The book will answer your quest ion.\" (After he finally read the book, he commented: \"That's pretty interesting. I never knew that.\" And I've heard that comment quite often, needless to say.) Needless to say, despite all these allegations and Dr. John Coleman's charge that \"Zionism\" was behind the JFK assassination, I never found any motive put forth. I've always been told that any murder investigation must inquire into possible motives. Well, lo and behold, as my own research continued, I did indeed begin to find motives for Israeli invo lvement in the JFK assassination. My first indication of an Israeli motive came when Seymour Hersch's book, The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy was issued in 1991. In this book Hersh very clearly outlines the fact"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"599 Questions & Answers [503] that JFK and Israel were seriously and dangerously at odds over Israel's drive to build a nuclear bomb, which Israel perceived as critical to its very survival. Hersh also delved into James J. Angleton's status as Israel's preeminent advocate at the CIA. At th e same time another critical volume was published: Andrew and Leslie Cockburn's Dangerous Liaison: The Inside Story of the U.S. - Israeli Covert Relationship. This book explored the conflict between JFK and Israel in similar detail and, like Hersh's book, be gan to shed an interesting new light (to me, and to others) on a little known facet of JFK's foreign policy and I began to see how it all did tie directly to some of the very forces that had an interest in his assassination. Then I began considering the as pects of Organized Crime's involvement in the JFK assassination and how there might indeed be a connection between Israel and Organized Crime. I started looking at the connections between organized crime and the CIA and thence to the Israeli Mossad. I knew that Meyer Lansky, the organized crime figure, had actually settled in Israel but I never realized, until I began my research, how intimately connected he was to the Jewish state. Nor did I realize how inaccurate the term \"the Mafia\" really is when descri bing the Organized Crime syndicate. Ultimately, if one seriously wishes to examine the history of organized crime you absolutely cannot take a realistic look at that history without considering the role of Meyer Lansky. It is critical because when one turn s over Lansky's tombstone you find the worms of the CIA and the Israeli Mossad crawling around there, perhaps even feeding upon one another. So I began to find that there were very close ties between the CIA and the Mossad and organized crime and that not only were all three working together in a number of spheres of influence over a long period of time, but that all of them had a distinct motive in wanting to remove JFK from the American presidency. As it is, of course, over the years, many of those who su ggested that the CIA had some sort of role in the assassination are fearful of suggesting that it was an institutional role, and instead say that they were \"rogue\" CIA elements. That, in my view, is quite a limp - wristed stance. To the best of my knowledge the one and only author (other than myself, of course) to say that the CIA had an institutional role in the affair was Mark Lane, writing in Plausible Denial. So, for whatever reason or reasons, there have been many \"researchers\" who have been unwilling or unable to acknowledge the depths of detail that have been unearthed in Plausible Denial that pinpoint institutional CIA involvement in the president's murder. Now I would be remiss in not giving credit to former Los Angeles police detective Gary Wean whos e book, There's a Fish in the Courthouse, provided me many valuable nuggets of information suggesting Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination. Gary's little - known book contains some particularly interesting information about strange CIA - related activi ties in Dallas, related to Gary"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"[504] Final Judgment 600 and to former Dallas Sheriff Bill Decker in the company of the late film actor and war - hero, Audie Murphy (a mutual friend of Wean and Decker) and I was pleased to be able to give Gary's book some additional publicity that it would not have otherwise received. Ironically, however, Gary has since suggested that Final Judgment is off the mark because my book focuses on the Mossad and does not blame the Jewish community in general for the JFK assassination. He has also attacke d me in various venues. I guess you can't please everybody. The actual \"birth\" of the book, Final Judgment, I suppose actually took place one evening when I sat down with a piece of paper and wrote down eight or nine key phrases, among them: \"JFK's Middle East policy,\" \"Mossad,\" \"Lansky,\" \"The Mafia,\" a few key names. At that juncture I began pulling a number of books off the shelf and began researching, then and there, the suspicions that were evolving no longer in the back of my mind but right there up fr ont at long last. I was actually surprised at what I came across. I was amazed when I pulled Stephen Green's 1984 book Taking Sides: America's Secret Relations With a Militant Israel off the shelf and discovered what a goldmine it was. Ironically, I had re ad the book some seven years before but it made no impression upon me at the time that Green pointed out — and I think this is quite profound — that upon JFK's assassination U.S. Middle East policy did an amazing 180 - degree turnabout. This hit me like a sledge hammer since I hadn't even turned to Green's book until after my basic thesis for Final Judgment had begun to evolve. This set me on a road of research that, frankly, as I moved forward, I was amazed by the amount of factual detail pointing toward an Israe li connection that I was uncovering in so - called \"mainstream\" sources. I found also, quite ironically, that in my course of research I was not necessarily relying heavily on JFK assassination - related books for many of the details that ultimately appeared i n Final Judgment. This in itself is interesting, if only in that it highlights the fact that no JFK researchers had ever made a serious inquiry into a possible Israeli role. As I've said time and again, I'm willing to excuse many of the JFK assassination r esearchers for their negligence if only for the reason that there was very little public information until relatively recently (perhaps beginning with Green's book, but certainly with the Hersh and Cockburn books) about the very difficult relationship betw een Israel and JFK. However, of course, I myself had overlooked it in reading Green's book. Needless to say, there's all this literature about \"The Mafia\" being behind the JFK assassination, etc etc, but as we'll see further (and as I've pointed out in Fin al Judgment), you can't stop your research into Organized Crime involvement when you come to Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss of New Orleans, and Santo Trafficante, the Mafia boss of Tampa. You have to look further and that is toward Meyer Lansky. Looking a t Lansky brings you back to both American and Israeli intelligence. As I've laid it out in Final Judgment you find that all of these aspects and"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"601 Questions & Answers [505] individuals did intersect very clearly in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on November 22, 1963. So the research for Fi nal Judgment was underway. The actual writing of the book involved setting up various sections which ultimately became chapters in the book and I organized the research material into those chapters. During that time I realized that there was indeed a great deal of material available and much of it I found in my own extensive personal library. It was very much like putting a jigsaw puzzle together and it was falling into place. All in all a very interesting process indeed. The initial research time and the a ssembly of the material for inclusion in the book probably took roughly two months. The actual writing was another process altogether, but I have to say that as I was writing I was continually researching what I was writing about and looking into other are as. I continued to find that there was a story to be told. Although I kept thinking until the very end of the writing process that I was going to find some fact or detail that would contradict my thesis, never once did I actually find anything that did. Th ere were times when I thought perhaps I might be overstating the case and when I double and triple - checked facts or details as much as I possibly could, I never found anything contradictory whatsoever. While I was already in the process of writing the book I came across an article by former Congressman Paul Findley (R - Ill.) in the March 1992 issue of The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, a publication issued by a group of former American diplomats who are somewhat hostile to Israel (to put it lightl y). I was surprised when Findley said that, \"It is interesting — but not surprising — to note that in all the words written and uttered about the Kennedy assassination, Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad, has never been mentioned. And yet a Mossad motive is obvious . . . Mossad complicity is as plausible as any of the other theories.\" Needless to say as I was already some four months into the writing of the book, I was amazed and delighted to see that Findley had taken the effort to write such a controver sial column, but it certainly received no publicity outside the pages of that limited - circulation magazine. So while Findley presented no firm evidence, I got the distinct impression that perhaps somebody had been talking to Findley and that there were som e people \"in the know\" who were talking about the possibility of Mossad involvement and I found this quite heartening. I told very few people that I was writing the book, to be honest, because I realized that the thesis was quite sensational. When I did te ll one person, he commented, somewhat sarcastically: \"Everyone wants to blame everything on the Jews.\" Well, I suppose this was the ultimate allegation. However, I became absolutely convinced as I was writing the book that I was truly digging into an area of JFK assassination that had never been seriously mined before. In a sense, I suppose, it was a gold mine that had never yet been discovered. So I can understand why many people never looked in this direction."},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"[506] Final Judgment 602 Another important thing to consider in rela tion to all this is that JFK assassination research has (and continues to be) a remarkably and particularly incestuous field. People were relying upon others' research and re - writing and re - hashing the information to the point that no real new ground was b eing broken. As an aside, I have to say that after Mark Lane came out with Rush to Judgment, most of the books on the JFK assassination (with a few notable exceptions) have essentially rehashed the initial material that Mark uncovered. He laid the groundwo rk for and publicized and popularized the national and international body of opinion that there was another story that needed to be told: that the Warren Commission Report was a fraud and that Lee Harvey Oswald was not \"one lone nut,\" by any means. Suffice it to say that Rush to Judgment laid the groundwork for all future efforts. However, if future \"researchers\" had investigated further, a book similar to Final Judgment might have been written a year or two after Rush to Judgment came forth. As it stands, that wasn't the case and the whole controversial project had to land in my lap. Did you have any secret sources that you can't name? No, I didn't have any \"secret sources,\" per se. Most of the material that I used in the preparation of Final Judgment was essentially in the public domain insofar as it was all published — all material that had appeared in popular magazines, books distributed by eminent publishing houses that are household names, etc. Everything is carefully documented and there were a total o f 746 footnotes in the third edition alone (up from 677 footnotes in the previous editions). Now, of course, this fourth edition is substantially expanded and even more thoroughly documented. Frankly, the only \"non - Establishment\" source used in the writing of Final Judgment was the material put together by the LaRouche organization's Executive Intelligence Review. Now most of this material related to the secretive Permindex organization, but, in fact, much of that material itself was a rehash of material th at had originally appeared in Paris Flammonde's The Kennedy Conspiracy (which, itself, had relied upon foreign press reports relating to Permindex). So there was nothing \"out of the ordinary\" that I used — no \"right wing\" or \"left wing\" extremist literature (however defined). I used no \"anti - Semitic\" sources either. Even those sources that were critical of Israel could hardly be called \"anti - Semitic,\" particularly the works by Stephen Green and Seymour Hersh who are both respected authors who do happen themse lves to be Jewish. My sources were not \"alternative press\" or \"offbeat\" either. All the primary material on all the key points in Final Judgment came from \"respectable\" and \"mainstream\" and \"responsible\" sources. The one \"secret source\" that I did rely upo n was a former French intelligence officer, Pierre Neuville, whose name I had kept under wraps until this, the fifth edition of Final Judgment."},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"60 3 Questions & Answers [507] However, I must point out, I did not rely on Pierre as a source until after the first draft of Final Judgment had been completed. And when Pierre came along I was ultimately satisfied that the thesis put forth in Final Judgment was complete and on the mark and that I had exhausted all resources available. I was in for a very intriguing surprise, however, when Pier re Neuville finally came along. How did you come in contact with your French source, Pierre? The circumstances as to how I came across this source are interesting in themselves. Upon the completion of the first draft of Final Judgment I made a telephone call to highly regarded former longtime Congressman Paul Findley (Rill.) very well known as a \"liberal,\" who had been somewhat critical of Israel and of its lobby in the United States. I thought that Findley might find the book of some interest and called him up and said, \"I'd like to send you a copy.\" He didn't know me, but he was familiar with The Spotlight newspaper (which, in fact, had been critical of him in the past) and I did send him a copy of the first draft of the book (which, at that juncture, I thought would essentially be the final draft, pending a number of minor editing recommendations, etc.) I was surprised when he acknowledged receipt of the book by saying that, as he put it in his letter, \"I will mention that over the past four years I have had lengthy correspondence with a retired diplomat from a western European nation whose family (including himself) has had disastrous experiences with Israel and the Mossad. He has been prodding me all that time to do what you have done.\" As you can imagi ne I'd spent all this time writing the book and trying to get it published and here was a former congressman of great repute (and certainly no \"extremist\" by any means) telling me that a retired diplomat had been urging him to write a book that contained t he very thesis put forth in Final Judgment. Well, obviously, I realized, I was not alone in my thinking. He told me he was going to send the diplomat the manuscript with my permission and I, of course, said, \"please do.\" I was subsequently surprised when I got a letter from Findley saying that while he thought it was a good book that it was inconclusive and that I had not proved my thesis. This was after he had read the first draft. (Frankly, I don't think, in any case, he would endorse it. He simply doesn' t want to be accused of being a \"conspiracy theorist\" on top of the frequent accusation that he is somehow an \"anti - Semite\" for being critical of Israel. In any case, I must say, in retrospect, knowing what was in that first draft (and which I thought was good) that the final draft — what was ultimately published — was far superior and far more complete. Nonetheless, I did also receive a letter from the intelligence officer who was now living in Canada. This gentlemen, who told me that he was a former French in telligence officer, did not at first reveal his name but he"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"[508] Final Judgment 604 provided me details that filled in the blanks and which pointed toward what we will call in shorthand \"The French Connection.\" On the one hand the Frenchman suggested that I was aiming in the ri ght direction, but he was emphatic in pointing out that I was, I suppose, using the wrong ammunition. I was trying to bring down an elephant with a cap gun or using a shotgun when a rifle would be better. In any event, the Frenchman supplied me what I need ed to bring my theory on target. He specifically stated to me that information to which he was privy did confirm my contention in the first draft of the book that James J. Angleton, Israel's man at the Mossad desk at the CIA, had been directly involved in the assassination plot. He also specifically named Colonel Georges deLannurien, a high - ranking figure of the French intelligence service, the SDECE, as having been involved in the conspiracy in a critical way. He also singled out Yitzhak Shamir as a conspi rator and in my own first draft of Final Judgment I had pointed out that Shamir had been the Mossad's European station chief, based in Paris, and, more importantly, had been head of the Mossad's special assassinations team that had been publicized by an Is raeli newspaper at the time I was writing Final Judgment. The Frenchman told me that Shamir had arranged, through the assistance of deLannurien, a French assassination team that had been involved in the JFK murder. This material pointed toward a new angle, so to speak, in the JFK assassination conspiracy. It added an additional element of the conspiracy that, frankly, I didn't at the time fully understand myself. However, this so - called \"French connection\" was something that other researchers had touched up on but either refused to pursue to its utmost — that is, the Israeli connection — or didn't understand. That is, to reiterate, the 'French Connection,\" which one might also call the \"Algerian Connection,\" is most definitely the Israeli connection. So having be en alerted, I began to review all of the material I could find relating to the relationship between France, its long - time colony, Arab Algeria, Israel and the United States and all of the key players involved. For those who are not immediately familiar wit h this aspect, I would refer them to the famous novel by Frederick Forsyth and the film based on the novel, The Day of the Jackal. This is a novel, based on fact, explaining the story of a conspiracy by former high - ranking French military officials and dip lomats to kill French President Charles DeGaulle. They were upset with him, to put it lightly, because of his decision to grant independence to the long - time French colony of Algeria, a major Arab state in North Africa. These French nationalists considered Algeria as a distinct part of France itself and viewed DeGaulle's surrender of Algeria to the native Algerian nationalist rebels as a betrayal of France. As a consequence, the French critics of DeGaulle formed the so - called Secret Army Organization known as the OAS. The OAS was operating in opposition to DeGaulle both in France and in Algeria, indeed worldwide. As it was the OAS and the French elements working both for and against the OAS involved an"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"605 Questions & Answers [509] amazing and intriguing cross section of French society and, most specifically, French intelligence. Although DeGaulle, in fact, had a long and friendly relationship with Israel, supplying the Jewish state vital material used in its nuclear development, not to mention other support, the fact is that Algerian i ndependence was not something that the Israelis wanted since this, obviously, would create a giant new Arab state in opposition to Israel. As a consequence the Israelis began to develop a strong and distinct alliance with elements in the French military an d in French intelligence who were opposed to Degaulle's decision to grant independence to Algeria. This presented an interesting configuration of conflicts. You had DeGaulle at the top ruling over a divided nation beneath him. You had the so - called French Corsican Mafia elements that were allied with the Lansky Crime Syndicate and who had also been allied in the past with the CIA, stemming back to the CIA's use of the Corsican Mafia to fight communist infiltration of French labor unions after World War II. Yet, you also had these French Corsican Mafia elements, at the same time, being utilized by DeGaulle's intelligence service against the Israeli - allied OAS. This is interesting in itself because you find the Corsicans in a strange triangle. On the one hand you had the Corsicans tied up with the Lansky Crime Syndicate which, in turn, was close to Israel's Mossad. On the other hand you had the Corsicans doing DeGaulle's work in fighting the OAS. In turn, however, the OAS was working with the Israeli Mossad and , interestingly, a Jewish anti - communist group known as the Jewish Anti - Communist League (JACL, for short), all fighting DeGaulle over the issue of Algeria. Nor can you forget the fact that the OAS itself was also receiving covert support from the Mossad's allies at the CIA. So, in short, what you had were diverse French elements interacting with those who were working both for and against Israel's interests. It was the same OAS group working to bring down DeGaulle that also happened to be tied to Guy Banis ter in New Orleans. Banister, of course, is the former FBI agent who had gone to work as a CIA contract agent financing and supplying anti - Castro Cuban exiles during the period prior to the JFK assassination. And it was Banister who had a very close and pe culiar relationship with none other than Lee Harvey Oswald during the time of Oswald's unusual period in New Orleans. All of this not to mention the fact, as pointed out in Final Judgment (and even by some JFK assassination researchers who avoid the Israel i connection, however) that the secretive Permindex entity, which included New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw on its board, was also linked to OAS attempts on the life of Charles DeGaulle, with money laundered through Israeli Mossad official Tibor Rosenbaum 's Banque De Credit Internationale. A small world indeed. The bottom line is that this \"French Connection\" or \"Algerian Connection\" is really the Israeli connection to the JFK assassination, any way you cut it."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"[510] Final Judgment 606 To get back to my French source: he had poi nted me in a direction, at that point, that I didn't totally understand. It required an immense amount of additional research on my part to understand the history of French Algeria, DeGaulle's conflicts with the OAS, DeGaulle's alliance with the Corsican M afia who fought the OAS on his behalf, and, of course, the conflicts within DeGaulle's own intelligence agencies where there were immensely conflicting loyalties over the Algerian controversy. All of this was unfamiliar to me and it became apparent in the end that it was an area that even many of the \"veteran\" JFK assassination researchers were not familiar with although quite a few of them had talked about the \"French Connection.\" Henry Hurt, writing in Reasonable Doubt and Dick Russell, writing in The Man Who Knew Too Much, had written about the French angle, but neither of them attempted to analyze the entirety of the dynamics at work in the French Connection. Those fighting DeGaulle were the very ones allied with Israeli intelligence, but these researche rs just didn't get it, so to speak. Even the Establishment histories of the Algerian conflict acknowledge that, in fact, the Israelis and people sympathetic to Israel's interests were working with the OAS. It's all in the history books. So if there is anyo ne who wants to try to pin the JFK assassination on the OAS, they cannot honestly do that without fingering the Israeli connection. To deny the Israeli connection is doing a disservice to the research. The Israeli and OAS connection ties back to Clay Shaw in New Orleans and, of course, to Guy Banister as well. You cannot ignore the Israeli connection to Permindex vis - à - vis the JFK assassination any more than you can ignore the critical Israeli connection to Permindex vis - à - vis OAS attempts to assassinate Ch arles DeGaulle. The reason why Permindex would be interested in killing Charles DeGaulle was because Permindex was an Israeli front and DeGaulle's policies on Algeria were inimical to the interests of Israel, just as, in turn, JFK's policies were inimical to Israel. Therefore anyone who prefers to be ignore all of this is being disingenuous, at the very least. The French Connection is vital to understanding the JFK assassination. In any case, in light of all these French connections, I substantially revised Final Judgment's first draft and this proved somewhat startling to me inasmuch as I had not expected that I would have to do this, having been highly satisfied with the first draft itself. However, having pursued the French Connection, I did indeed realiz e that there was a French Connection which, of course, was ultimately the Israeli connection. So it was that I revised the book and it was sent to press. Upon publication of the first edition, I sent Final Judgment to the French diplomat who wrote me back saying \"good work\" and added that JFK would have been proud of me. That was satisfying, to say the least. How reliable was your French source, Pierre Neuville?"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"607 Questions & Answers [511] Frankly, I don't know how reliable he is, any more than anyone knows how reliable any source is on any aspect of anything involving the JFK assassination. No one can vouch for the total reliability of any source. However, everything that I know about him (based upon the information that he provided about himself, plus the endorsement he received f rom ex - Congressman Paul Findley who put me in touch with him) leads me to believe that my French source is not only sincere, but totally reliable. Pierre Neuville himself said \"in the suspicion business there are no nice guys, only bad guys.\" In other word s, what appear to be \"friendly\" sources from the \"suspicion business\" [i.e. the world of intelligence] might, in fact, by enemies providing you disinformation and misinformation. And it was even the Mossad's man at the CIA, James Jesus Angleton, who called the world of intelligence \"a wilderness of mirrors.\" At any rate, the bottom line is that Final Judgment can stand or fall on its own merits, without the specific input of this French source. In addition, as I noted earlier, I could have easily published the book without delving into the French Connection and still, I believe, provided the readers a very strong case for Mossad involvement in the JFK assassination. What I believe I have done, though, in Final Judgment is to draw a very fine and significant line between the French Connection to the JFK assassination and the New Orleans Connection (so to speak) that involves the two CIA assets, Guy Banister and Clay Shaw, right to the Israel Connection. Anyone could have done it without my French source. Afte r Final Judgment was published, did anyone come forth with any \"inside\" information that wasn't included in the original edition? There has not been anything that I have received, other than the communications from my French source who ultimately identifi ed himself by name and gave me his complete history, including some rather striking details about his own interesting family and its background. In the postscript to Final Judgment I've provided background on Pierre's own experiences with the Mossad. Howev er, since the book was published, no one has come forward with any new information which is of an \"inside\" nature. I myself have discovered further published information confirming other details that appeared in the original edition of Final Judgment and i n the revised editions, including this most recent edition. How long did it take you to write the book? From the time the idea actually began to formulate in my mind when I began the serious research to the time the first draft was completed was roughly seven months. After I began researching the French Connection after my French source read the first draft and pointed me in that direction, it took an additional three months to fine tune my manuscript and add the new findings that I'd uncovered. However, it was a never - ending process, as I found out after the book was published and that's why in the third edition"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"[512] Final Judgment 608 of the book I included many, many new details that brought the thesis even more full circle. The subsequent editions contain much more. I'm ama zed, at this point, at how much I've come across. I cannot help but recall that literally one day before the book was scheduled to go to the printer for the first time and I felt that I had put everything that I could possibly put in the pages of the book and was content that the volume was complete (including all of the additional information regarding the so - called French Connection), I happened to be sitting on my living room floor flipping through a bound volume of a now - defunct newsletter. At that time I stumbled across something that literally made me say out loud to myself: \"Oh my God!\" I had discovered something else that unquestionably had to be added to the manuscript. I had discovered a very, very significant fact, which ultimately appeared in Cha pter 15 of Final Judgment , wherein I dissect the Permindex mystery: the connections between the Mossad, the CIA, the Lansky syndicate, the French OAS and the plot to kill JFK. What I discovered were details about a gentleman who had come to visit New Orlea ns District Attorney Jim Garrison when he was still in the earliest stages of his investigation into the assassination. Bear in mind that at this point Garrison had not yet come across the name of Clay Shaw. It was at this time that Garrison received a vis it from a businessman named John King. The visit to Garrison by King has been mentioned in several JFK books and the authors continue referring to King as a \"Denver oilman\" with ties to the Republican Party, etc. The other JFK writers suggest that King was interested in interfering with the Garrison investigation, obviously, because he was a bad man and was possibly trying to help cover up for someone, presumably the Republican Party and Richard Nixon and other such villains. Well, King was obviously aware that Garrison was on the right track and he offered Garrison a deal: if Garrison dropped the investigation King promised to arrange Garrison's appointment to a federal judgeship. I repeat again that this was before Clay Shaw's name came up. However, it jus t so happens, as I pointed out in Final Judgment , that it was during the very period of King's visit to New Orleans that this \"Denver oilman\" was also involved in lucrative international business dealings conducted jointly with Bernard Cornfeld, head of th e corrupt financial venture known as Investors Overseas Services (I0S). Cornfeld, in fact, was a close friend and protégé and front man for none other than Tibor Rosenbaum, the veteran Israeli diplomat and Mossad official who was a key financial figure beh ind Permindex on whose board served none other than Clay Shaw! Other JFK assassination researchers had focused on King's \"Republican\" connections and his ties to the oil industry but they missed the real smoking gun: King had very close connections to Clay Shaw, the Permindex board member, whom Garrison hadn't even yet identified as a suspect in the conspiracy. Somebody somewhere (and we now know who"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"609 Questions & Answers [513] that was) had an interest in preventing Garrison from going any further and latching onto Clay Shaw (which , of course, Garrison ultimately did). King — the so - called \"Denver oilman\" — is yet another Israeli Connection in the JFK assassination conspiracy, as hard as that fact might be for those researchers who try to use King's interference in the Garrison investig ation as \"proof\" that, for example, King's friend Richard Nixon was behind the JFK assassination. (Nixon truly is a convenient villain, isn't he?) I was surprised myself to learn of King's Israeli connection, inasmuch as I already knew about King. But, as I say, I didn't know about his ties to Permindex until just a day before I was getting ready to send Final Judgment to the printer. This is just one example, but a significant one, of the un - ending process of researching into the JFK assassination conspira cy. I suppose the bottom line is that unless you have all of the information that you need in front of you (and many JFK researchers for many years did not) you cannot make, shall we say, a \"final judgment.\" Perhaps some day in the distant future there wil l indeed be a final judgment, the title of my own book notwithstanding, if someone has before them everything that I've written and everything else that will be written and which can all be compiled together into the final judgment. Is it possible there w ere so - called \"rogue elements\" in the Mossad that participated in the JFK assassination and that they did so acting on their own without official sanction? This is not possible. Involvement by the Mossad in the JFK assassination was ordered at the highest levels. Based upon what I've learned about the structure of the Mossad, I firmly believe that Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion was the individual who ordered Mossad collaboration in the assassination conspiracy and that it was probably his last act before resigning his post in disgust with JFK's stand toward Israel. I believe that the Mossad's involvement was institutional in nature. Likewise, I would add, with the CIA. However, in the case of the involvement of the French SDECE's Colonel Georges de Lannurien — as I point out in Final Judgment — this was a classic case of a \"rogue\" operator. This French conspirator was most definitely not doing the bidding of French President Charles DeGaulle, but he was assisting his Mossad ally, Yitzhak Shamir, and his CIA ally, James Angleton, with whom deLannurien spent the day at CIA headquarters in Langley on November 22, 1963. And you can bet the family silver that deLannurien and Angleton were not together on that particular day for the purpose of discussing the we ather. What did Mark Lane have to say about Final Judgment? I did not indicate to Mark during the writing of Final Judgment that I was writing the book. As I've pointed out, I actually told very few people"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"[514] Final Judgment 610 that I was writing the book. I didn't want Mark — or anybody else — to judge the book prior to its completion based on a sketchy overview. I wanted Mark (and others) to read the book in its entirety. I presented the completed first draft to him and said, \"Well, let me know what you think.\" Mark's response was heartening. He said that the book did make a \"strong case\" for Mossad involvement and he did not believe that the book conflicted in any way with his own book, Plausible Denial, which pinpointed the CIA's role in the assassination of President Kennedy. Whether the actual idea for the assassination first originated at the CIA or at the Mossad, the fact remains that those at the CIA who were the prime CIA players in the assassination conspiracy were intimately tied to the Mossad and were operating in its spheres of influence, even including in the so - called \"French Connection.\" So in the JFK assassination the CIA and the Mossad were essentially two sides of one coin. As far as Mark Lane's opinion of Final Judgment is concerned, it was suggested to me prior to publication that I ask him to write an introduction to the book. I rejected this suggestion out of hand. Not that it wouldn't have been an honor and a privilege to have Mark write the introduction. However, the fact is that Mark has stirred up a hornet 's nest with his own books on the JFK assassination and on other subjects for that matter. Mark had not researched the Mossad aspect as I had, so I didn't feel it would be appropriate to expect him to put his name in defense or endorsement of a thesis — quit e a revolutionary one, I suppose — that he himself had not originated. Additionally, because of the very fact that Final Judgment tied Israel to the JFK assassination I did not think it would be appropriate for Mark to have his name appended to an introducti on to the book, precisely because of the fact that Mark himself had become involved in the Middle East controversy and had been a critic of Israel. I recognized that the thesis of Final Judgment was inflammatory on its own and I didn't want to put Mark in the position of having to defend my work. He's been busy enough as it is fighting off the efforts of the CIA and the FBI and the media to ignore or suppress or distort his own efforts. Doesn't Final Judgment conflict with Mark Lane's book, Plausible Denia l, which contends the CIA was responsible for the JFK assassination? There is no conflict whatsoever. Plausible Denial is first and foremost an account of Mark Lane's defense of The Spotlight newspaper against E. Howard Hunt's libel suit. Final Judgment, in my view, amplifies many of the findings in Plausible Denial and further confirms the conclusions of Plausible Denial and adds further details that prove that the CIA was indeed involved in the assassination. The greatest strength of Mark's book, I belie ve, is that it demolishes the myth that there were \"rogue elements\" of the CIA involved in the president's murder. These were not \"rogue elements.\" The assassination was an act that involved the CIA at its highest levels — and specifically James Angleton, th e Mossad's ally at the CIA."},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"611 Questions & Answers [515] Someone once described Final Judgment as a \"sequel\" to Plausible Denial and I would like to think that this is an accurate description. But you can't make a serious study of the JFK assassination without having read Plausible Denial. What have the media reviewers said about Final Judgment? With the exception of the frenzied media coverage that I've discussed in the introduction as of January 1998 there have not been any formal reviews of any kind of Final Judgment in the majo r \"mainstream\" media, although there have been a handful of reviews such as these: The first review appeared in my own national weekly newspaper, The Spotlight, and it probably won't surprise anyone to learn that the review was quite laudatory. I am please d to say, however, that the review in question was unsolicited and was submitted by none other than Eustace Mullins, one of the most respected and most prolific writers and researchers in the populist movement in America. The second review of Final Judgmen t appeared in the Washington Jewish Week on April 28, 1994 and is discussed in Final Judgment in the afterword. The third review appeared in the aforementioned Steamshovel Press in its undated issue Number 11. Although the reviewer suggested that the book was perhaps anti - Semitic in tone, he did say this about my allegation that the Mossad had a hand in the conspiracy: \"The thesis certainly has been under - examined in the past and raises some interesting historical questions about the relationship between th e Kennedys and Israel that date back to Joseph Kennedy's Neville Chamberlain - like nods to the Nazis.\" Other than this cautious commentary, Steamshovel has been remarkably reticent about mentioning the book or providing me the opportunity in its pages to de bate, for example, one Dave Emory, who actually contends that there is a \"Nazi\" connection to the JFK assassination. Other than these reviews (along with several others discussed elsewhere in these pages, there have been none, although I have sent review c opies to all of the key editorial staff members of the Washington Post, the Washington Post Book World and the New York Times, among many, many other media outlets. I personally presented Michael Isikoff of Newsweek a copy of the book, but I've yet to hear even a whimper from him. I think the deafening silence speaks for itself. W h a t ki n d o f s o u r c e s d i d y o u r e l y o n w h e n w r i t i n g F i n a l Judgment? Following the release of earlier editions of Final Judgment there were several attempts to suggest that the book relied upon less - than - reliable sources — that my sources were biased, that they were \"anti - Israel\" or otherwise perhaps \"too right wing\" in nature. That's nonsense. Don't believe it. For the record, let's review the sources that I cited."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"[516] Final Judgment 612 By anyone's standa rds, of the 111 volumes referenced in the bibliography of the third edition of Final Judgment, at least 85% of those sources were from \"mainstream\" or \"major\" publishers. Additionally, roughly 73% of the references cited didn't even have anything to do wit h the JFK assassination itself. By my count, only 2% of the sources cited in the third edition came from \"pro - Arab\" publishing houses. What's more, as I have noted in Final Judgment, my primary sources on JFK's struggle with Israel come from sources such a s Seymour Hersh, Stephen Green and Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, none of whom can be described as extremists in any way. Only 7% of the sources referenced in the bibliography of the third edition could be clearly cited as being from sources that are \"right w ing\" in nature and one of those sources — the memoirs of former American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell — is cited in the bibliography only because I make passing reference to the fact that Rockwell dedicated his book to a gentleman, DeWest Hooker, who is quoted in Final Judgment. The Rockwell book was referenced in the bibliography only for the record and is not provided as \"proof' or \"evidence\" of Israel's involvement in the JFK assassination. So please, critics, don't try to cite Rockwell as one o f my sources. By so doing you will only demonstrate how determined you are to try to discredit my theory in any way possible. One effort to discredit my research falls flat if you look at the facts. Take a look at the trick that Richard Morrock of Bay Terr ace, New York played on people when he wrote a letter to Steamshovel Press (which was published without comment) in which he claimed that \"about a third\" of the sources cited in Final Judgment came from publications of the Lyndon LaRouche organization. In fact, of the 746 citations appearing in the third edition of Final Judgment, only 30 of them — four percent — came from LaRouche sources and most of them were passing historical references that didn't even touch on the actual thesis of Final Judgment itself. A nd for the record, here's an analysis of the LaRouche citations.   Eight (that is 27%) of the 30 notes citing LaRouche publications were passing references to the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and its connections to a number of bankers with ties to the Lansky syndicate, etc. Only one of these ADL references had anything even directly to do with the JFK assassination per se: the fact that New Orleans intelligence operative Guy Banister was close to the ADL's self - described \"super communist hunter\" A. I. Botnick.   Four of the LaRouche citation footnotes (13% of the total) appeared in two appendices (in the third edition) which were supplemental in nature and not central to the basic thesis of the book. (One of the appendices in question, the one dealing with the strange activities of government informant Roy Frankhauser, was added for the first time when the third edition of Final Judgment was published.)   Two notes were biographical details about Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum and one was about an Israeli banker w ho served on the board of Rosenbaum's Banque De Credit International."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"613 Questions & Answers [517]   Two notes were about gun - running to Israel in the 1940's. One additional such note pointed out that the brother of a Permindex founder was active in running guns to Israel's Irgun.   One note was about Meyer Lansky's ties to the famed \"Operation Underworld\" which utilized the mob against the Axis powers.   Three notes were about various mob - and Mossad - connected banking and business connections that had no direct bearing to the Kennedy assas sination itself.   One note pointed out that Permindex Chairman Louis Bloomfield's law firm had ties to the Bronfman interests.   Four notes contained background information on four persons connected to Tibor Rosenbaum's Permindex operation.   One note dealt wit h the French OAS reportedly receiving money from Guy Banister.   One note dealt with for mer FBI operative Walter Sheridan's connections to Resorts International.   One note dealt with the Hunt's family's possible ties to Israel's nuclear development. (Two addi tional such notes were among those, mentioned earlier, that dealt with the ADL in passing.)   One note was an extensive quote from former federal undercover informant Roy Frankhauser about which I comment \"how much of what Frankhauser says is true is beyond the scope of this volume.\" In fact, this is the only LaRouche citation on the subject of the JFK assassination per se. I'll note additionally that much of the above - referenced material taken from LaRouche sources also appears in other works on the JFK assa ssination and the history of organized crime, among other places. When I contacted the aforementioned Morrock — who admitted to me that he considered himself \"a Zionist\" — and confronted him about the misinformation, he advised me in no uncertain terms that he wouldn't believe \"anything\" that I had to say. He also admitted that he had never done any substantive investigation of the JFK assassination — a fact which suggests that his real motivation in trying to discredit me was stimulated largely by the fact that I had dared to bring Israel into the picture. Morrow also made the outlandish claim that it was clear that my employer, Willis Carto, was essentially the real author of the book and that Carto had \"dictated\" the book, which, of course, is just simply not t rue. But this is the kind of criticism that I've had to deal with. In this edition of Final Judgment I have incorporated quite a bit of new information from additional sources, and I have incorporated other information taken from a number of sources that w ere cited in the reference notes of the previous editions. However, I will add, for the record, that the inclusion of this new information does not substantially alter in any way the statistics cited above. My sources are broad - ranging and come from differ ing points of view. The vast majority of them are cited for the first - time ever (as in the previous editions) in any book on the JFK assassination. I remain quite happy with my choice of sources and I think that the open -"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"[518] Final Judgment 614 minded reader will agree that th e sources complement one another quite well. As always, I'll let the reader make the final judgment. How did you know which sources were reliable? As I mentioned earlier, I relied on many, many sources and an overwhelming majority of those sources are \"m ainstream\" sources, even among those in the lore of the JFK assassination conspiracy. Not on any major point in any area of the book did I find anything that didn't seem to be backed up by other sources. The fact is that the book does rely on standard sour ces. I do suppose the biggest problem in research in any area such as this is that you find many sources that are actually putting out so - called \"black propaganda\": disinformation that is designed to confuse. However, I did make a serious effort to try to continually have (especially where I had any doubts) a number of sources that confirmed the basic facts of the particular area that I happened to be writing about. What have authors of other JFK books said about Final Judgment? This is a very interesting question, to say the very least. Let's take Jim Marrs, for example. Marrs is the author of the mammoth volume, Crossfire, examining virtually all of the JFK assassination conspiracies. This book came out before Final Judgment and Marrs' book does, to its credit, get into the Permindex connection and quotes the LaRouche organization's Executive Intelligence Review in regard to Permindex. H o w e v e r , M a r r s o n l y g o e s s o f a r a s t o m e n t i o n t h e possibility — although he never necessarily acknowledges it as fact — that Permindex had ties to the international drug trade. (Marrs never mentions Lansky. It's only \"the Mafia\" as far as he's concerned.) And, of course, Marrs never ever gets into the Israeli Connection, even though, as I've pointed out earlier, Marrs' own sourc e, Executive Intelligence Review, focuses on Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum's role in Permindex. Be all of this as it may, I sent Marrs a copy of Final Judgment after it was first released. However, I do have to admit that in my letter to Marrs I did point out some things about Oliver Stone that led me to be suspicious of Stone's motives in bringing JFK to the screen in the fashion that he did. I pointed out to Marrs that I had been told (although I've never actually confirmed it, to be completely honest) th at Stone was a major contributor to AIPAC, the registered lobby for Israel. I also pointed out that Stone had ignored the \"French Connection,\" (as I noted earlier). Now at this juncture I will mention (as I did in Final Judgment) that Oliver Stone paid som e $200,000 or more to Jim Marrs at the time Stone was putting JFK together. So I understand why Marrs would be hesitant to criticize or to acknowledge criticism of a man who had obviously made him rich overnight. And don't forget that the \"moneybags\" behin d Oliver Stone and the film JFK was Arnon Milchan, the film's executive producer, who has been"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"615 Questions & Answers [519] described by liberal columnist Alexander Cockburn as \"Israel's largest arms dealer.\" However, more recently, Marrs has said some friendly things about Final Ju dgment, although he's not endorsed it altogether. I likewise sent a copy of the book to William Turner, who has been an assassination investigator and the co - author of Deadly Secrets (formerly titled The Fish is Red) which is about the joint CIA - Organized Crime plots against Fidel Castro that seem to intersect with the JFK assassination conspiracy. I also sent a copy of Final Judgment to Gaeton Fonzi, author of The Last Investigation, who was an investigator for the House Assassinations Committee inquiry in to the JFK murder. I even pointed out to Fonzi that he and I had at least one mutual acquaintance. However, I never received an acknowledgment from either Turner or Fonzi. Neither likewise have I heard from Jack Newfield of the New York Post to whom I sent a copy of the book. Newfield's most recent claim to fame is his story that Teamsters Union boss Jimmy Hoffa was behind the JFK murder — a theory that got wide play. Newfield's \"Hoffa Killed JFK\" story stemmed from his relationship with Frank Ragano, a forme r lawyer for Hoffa and Santo Trafficante, the Tampa Mafia boss. I even challenged Newfield to debate me on the subject on a national radio talk show, Radio Free America, hosted by my colleague at The Spotlight, Tom Valentine. I also sent a copy of my book to David Scheim, author of Contract on America, that contends the \"The Mafia Killed JFK.\" Scheim's book, in my opinion as an author and editor with an eye for these things, is nothing more than an enriched, expanded re - write of the book The Plot to Kill th e President by G. Robert Blakey who was director of the House Assassinations Committee investigation and who, in that capacity, was determined not to find any CIA or FBI or intelligence community involvement in the murder of the president. As I pointed out in Final Judgment, Scheim tended to portray Meyer Lansky as an insignificant figure who was a low - level mob figure, a flunky to the Mafia, when, in fact, obviously, he was much bigger than that. Scheim — dare I say it? — is Jewish and it could well be that th is may have been some element in his bias. Nonetheless, whatever his bias, Scheim does have some credibility in some circles. Still, he has never acknowledged receipt of the book nor has he agreed to debate me as I asked. If my theory is so obviously ridic ulous, I would think that Scheim would relish the opportunity to demolish the theory, not only because he believes that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" but because, as a Jewish American (and perhaps a devotee of Israel), he would have the chance to refute the claim that the Jewish state had a hand in the assassination. I would think that he would take this golden opportunity to demolish me publicly. But Scheim never took me up on the offer to debate. A good friend of mine, Donald L. Kimball, has written three books on the JFK assassination. He's a prolific writer and a dedicated American, but to the best of my knowledge he has never even read Final Judgment. But I've learned that Don dismissed Final Judgment out of hand after he heard about the release of the book sa ying, \"Oh, well, Mike gets into all that stuff"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"[520] Final Judgment 616 about the Mossad.\" What can I say? I think that Don has the same attitude that the better - known JFK assassination researchers have and that is that they are willing to write and talk about the JFK assassinat ion as long as they don't step on the toes of Israel and its American lobby. Let's face it: the Israeli lobby has close ties to the American media, and particularly the book publishing and distribution industry. Anybody who denies that there is a strong pr o - Israel bias in the American media is again, either a liar or a fool or both. So I understand why the authors of books on the JFK assassination don't want to cross the media. It's not in their financial interest to do so. In the \"Final Word?\" section of t his book, I discuss my adventures on the Internet discussion groups devoted to the JFK assassination, trading ideas (and insults) with an unusually eclectic group of people — some open - minded, some close - minded, but all with a variety of opinions. To be sure , there was a lot of hostility toward my particular approach, but I was pleasantly surprised (as you shall see) to find more than a few people who were willing to give me friendly input and who were not prepared to dismiss my theory outright. At the same t ime, though, I did find that even some of the most able critics of my theory were, in fact, unable to refute my theory (at least as far as I was concerned) and that was actually a relief to me, for I was frankly concerned that perhaps I had missed some det ail somewhere that would bring the thesis of Final Judgment come crashing down. But that didn't happen — and I don't think it ever will. What about the JFK Assassination Research and Information Center in Dallas? Until the center recently went out of busines s, they held an annual confab in which JFK \"buffs\" and \"fanatics\" came to Dallas to talk about their favorite subject — to ponder every possible theory about whether the fatal shot was fired from a storm drain or from a flying saucer. They will debate these subjects for hours on end. However, when I asked to come to Dallas to speak about Final Judgment which had already sold 8,000 copies all over America, I never even received an acknowledgment from these people who are ostensibly dedicated to finding out the truth. Now either I am a total crank or I am right on the mark and they don't want to discuss it. I leave it up to the readers of Final Judgment to make their own determination. I don't believe that anybody who has read Final Judgment with an open, honest approach considers me a crank. Yet the people at the JFK Center in Dallas adopted the attitude of my friend Don Kimball who is afraid to get \"into all that stuff about the Mossad.\" The JFK Center was a money - making venture and it needed publicity. They wo uldn't get good publicity (or any publicity, for that matter) if they started talking about possible Israeli involvement in the assassination. I did advertise Final Judgment in the 1993 program of the JFK Center's annual conference and I did a mailing to r oughly 300 people from that conference and I received several friendly letters from a number of researchers. I have reached the conclusion, however, that these people are more interested in debating things that can never be answered: how many"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"617 Questions & Answers [521] shots were fired; what kind of bullets were used; where the bullets hit; etc. The list of such questions — and missing answers — goes on and on. However, these are not the questions we need to resolve. What we need to resolve is who really killed John F. Kennedy and why. To pursue that question is to come across that most unpleasant answer: that the Israelis were indeed involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy. That is something that the pantywaists do not wish to acknowledge. Have you made any major changes in the c onclusions that you reached in Final Judgment since the book was first published? There were many typographical errors in earlier editions of the book. But, more importantly, the minor errors of fact that appeared in previous editions have been corrected and in my special \"challenge to the readers\" I have outlined those errors for the record and point out that they have nothing to do with the thesis of the book Other than those corrections, I have not revised the original thesis as it was put forth in the first edition. I have tightened up the book here and there but I have not deleted any substantive material relative to the thesis itself. The book thus stands essentially as it was first written but is now much stronger and far more comprehensive than ever , covering areas related to the assassination and the cover - up that were not discussed in the previous editions, particularly the new findings that I've unearthed regarding longtime CIA operative Frank Sturgis' little - known work for the Mossad — an explosive detail indeed. Since the first edition was released, I've also come to the conclusion that the so - called \"Mafia\" connection to the JFK assassination is more a distraction than anything and in summarizing my findings I have cited that reassessment for the benefit of the readers, although those who have read even the first edition will find that, from the start, I had very carefully delineated the likelihood that \"Mafia\" involvement was cursory at best. You have been critical of Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Wh y? Hasn't Stone done good work by exposing new facts about the JFK assassination to a bigger audience than anyone has ever done? Stone's defenders have pointed out that Stone had a very complicated subject to deal with in the film and that he couldn't inc lude everything and that's absolutely true. I cannot disagree with that. Stone's defenders also say: \"Well, if he wanted to get out at least part of the story, Stone couldn't very well delve into the Israeli connection — even if he wanted to — because then he couldn't get any financing or distribution for the film.\" That's true. However, the financial interests behind the production, distribution and promotion of Oliver Stone's \"alternative history\" or \"alternative theory\" of the JFK assassination are tied to b oth Israel and the Lansky Crime Syndicate which itself had ties to both the Mossad and the CIA, even, most especially, during the period of the CIA - Mob plots against Castro that all"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"[522] Final Judgment 618 JFK assassination researchers seem to agree played at least a peripheral role in the events leading up to the president's murder. I thus have to ask Stone's defenders: what is their opinion of Stone's film in light of what I think is significant evidence indeed that the Mossad played a key part in the JFK assassination? Was St one's film actually \"black propaganda\" designed to give a popularized \"final judgment,\" so to speak, to the American people about what supposedly happened in Dallas? That is, in effect, what the film has done, and it has done it in a fashion such that the \"solution\" is far from anything but that. What is your opinion of the film, Executive Action? Mark Lane was one of the prime movers behind this film, but Lane himself ultimately was unhappy with the final version of the film in that it did not, in his v iew, adequately address the role of the CIA in the assassination of President Kennedy. All in all, however, Executive Action is a good film and very well constructed and there's no doubt that Stone relied heavily on the foundation laid by Executive Action in structuring his own film. Like Stone's film, Executive Action, does not name any high - level conspirators per se. The film, like Stone's film, does betray a certain \"liberal\" bias, if you will. I always find watching the film very instructive, however, i n that it does outline a theory, in a very concise fashion, of how a small group of conspirators could have carried off the JFK assassination. I would urge anyone who wants a capsule overview of the basic JFK assassination conspiracy to see Executive Actio n. What has been the reaction in the Arab world to your book, inasmuch as it does lay the blame for the JFK assassination on Israel? There have been Arab - Americans who have read the book and have said it's a great book. One Arab - American — not a stereotypi cal \"Rich Arab\" by the way; he's a Christian minister, no less — bought precisely 102 copies of the book. I've sent copies to all of the Arab embassies and received one letter of acknowledgment, saying, essentially: \"Looking forward to reading your book.\" Th e Libyan Embassy in New York bought three additional copies of the book after receiving my complimentary copy. But the book hasn't been subsidized by the Arabs and it isn't Arab propaganda. It wasn't conceived by the Arabs, either. It wasn't until even aft er the publication of the fourth edition that a single Arab publishing house finally decided to publish an Arabic translation of the book. So Arab money was never a factor behind the publication and distribution of the initial publication of the book and t he truth is that even the Arabic - language publisher of the book has not provided the book the kind of distribution that I would have expected. I must say, though, that I was delighted when I received an invitation to address the Second Green Dialogue for a n Alternative World Order held in Tripoli, Libya under the sponsorship of the Vienna - based Jamahir Society"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"619 Questions & Answers [523] for Philosophy and Culture. Unfortunately, because of restrictions against travel to Libya (imposed upon Americans by the pressure of the Israeli l obby), I was unable to attend. However, the organizers asked me to submit a written statement which was read aloud to the participants who had come from all corners of the globe. In the aftermath I received wonderful letters from people as far away as Malt a, Ghana, Guyana and New Zealand who were, it seems, profoundly surprised to learn there are a few Americans unafraid to raise questions about the U.S. relationship with Israel. I am grateful to those people from the so - called \"Third World\" who took the ti me to write and am thankful that there are a few places where freedom of speech (when it comes to the subject of Israeli intrigue) still exists. I might mention, additionally, that when my publisher attempted to purchase a full - page advertisement for Final Judgment in the pages of an \"Arabist\" publication, The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, the editors rejected the advertisement. Not because the advertisement was \"controversial,\" but because the editors were afraid that the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith would use the publication of the advertisement to suggest that they were tied in some way to my then - employer, Liberty Lobby, which the ADL claimed was \"anti - Semitic.\" (The Washington Report did, however, publish a letter to the edit or from me — a minor concession, I suppose). Yet the influence of the ADL is felt even among those who are inclined to the \"Arabist\" point of view. As recently as the Oct/Nov 1999 issue of The Washington Report, a letter writer, Tim Hanley, commented that \"T here is considerable evidence linking the Israelis to the assassination of JFK. It's too hot a subject to touch in the [Washington Report], but nevertheless there is evidence . . . How come I doubt that that subject will ever come under public scrutiny?\" T o Mr. Hanley's letter, the editor responded: \" . . . Let us add that while we know that lots of people in the Middle East associate JFK's assassination with the possibility that he was on the verge of re - orienting U.S. Middle East policy toward a more even - handed approach, there is no hard evidence linking that to his death.\" Clearly the editors at The Washington Report are not going to lend themselves to publicizing Final Judgment, despite the fact that many of their readers have obviously read Final Judgm ent or otherwise heard about the book. I question their judgment, but the decision is theirs to make. In March of 2003 I did have the unique opportunity to lecture at a leading Arab think tank in the Middle East, the Zayed International Centre for Coordina tion and Follow - Up — much to the dismay of the Anti - Defamation League, which raised a major ruckus about my appearance there — but the subject of Final Judgment was only mentioned in passing in the course of my lecture about U.S. media bias in favor of Israel. Has there been any reaction in Israel to your book? At this juncture, the reaction in Israel has been limited. The first was a rather interesting Internet review of Final Judgment written by Barry"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"[524] Final Judgment 620 Chamish, the maverick Israeli journalist, who said tha t Final Judgment \"makes a pretty cogent case for the Mossad being the moving force behind the assassination of JFK.\" A self - described \"Zionist\" who says he is \"committed to the strength and survival of Israel,\" Chamish has helped stir a tempest in Israel r ecently by documenting to the satisfaction of many that Israeli intelligence was involved in the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In his review of Final Judgment, he says that he accepts my contention that the Permindex corporation wa s indeed a Mossad front for covert operations. That's an important concession indeed, considering the debate among JFK researchers as to what Permindex was — or was not. Chamish did have several criticisms, but none of which were damaging to the basic thesis which Chamish has essentially endorsed. He said that while, in his view, \"Piper gets lots right and lots wrong . . . what is bothersome is it doesn't take much of what he gets right to make a case for Israeli involvement\" in the JFK assassination. One of the things Chamish said I got \"wrong\" was labeling former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (whom Chamish admires) as a former \"terrorist.\" That description is a matter of opinion, subject to debate. Begin killed British officers in Palestine. He blew them up with bombs. That's terrorism, by my definition anyway. However, Chamish does concur that my suggestion that Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion (angry at JFK for trying to stop Israel from building the nuclear bomb) may have thus decided, in Ch amish's words, \"to contribute Mossad expertise to [JFK's] assassination\" is reasonable speculation. Chamish said that, in his view, \"the assassination's core plot was American and its genesis predated any possible Israeli involvement.\" He believes that \"Am erica corrupted Israel and not the other way around.\" Chamish said that he would have been inclined, previously, to dismiss my thesis \"as a fantastic yarn,\" except that in his research into the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin that he \"independently discover ed too many facts in common with Piper's.\" Noting that I was a correspondent for The Spotlight (about which Chamish probably heard a few choice rumors) Chamish said that this \"is not really thrilling to me\" but he points out that \"about half of Piper's sou rces are Jewish\" and that \"all in all, Piper doesn't sound like an anti - Semite and I can spot one. I believe he is a sincere truthseeker.\" C h a m i s h s a y s t h a t \" t h e w e i g h t o f [ P i p e r ' s ] e v i d e n c e \" i s \"circumstantial\" but still \"impressive,\" although \"far from c onclusive.\" However, I have been the first to point out that although the evidence presented in Final Judgment is circumstantial, it is no less circumstantial than evidence put forth by those who contend, for example, that \"the Mafia killed JFK.\" Chamish h as also gone so far as to make a connection between Final Judgment and the death of JFK, Jr., son of the late president. Chamish pointed out — as I noted in the fourth edition of Final Judgment a year before young Kennedy's demise — that JFK Jr. had published an extended"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"621 Questions & Answers [525] report in the March 1997 issue of his George magazine alleging Israeli intelligence was behind the Rabin assassination. Thus, concludes Chamish, \"We don't know what drove [JFK Jr.] to stand alone in seeking the Rabin truth, but it may have ha d much to do with the information contained within Final Judgment.\" From an Israeli, needless to say, this is a very powerful endorsement and an honest one. More recently, internationally known Israeli dissident Israel Shamir cited Final Judgment in one of his writings. Shamir — not to be confused with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir — has been hotly critical of Israel's continuing violence and international intrigue against its enemies. In Final Judgment you charge that long - time Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was directly involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy. Aren't you afraid of a libel suit from Shamir? Shamir headed the Mossad's official hit team at the time of the JFK assassination, so he is not very likely to want to bring attention to that fact by bringing a libel suit against me. It would open up an unpleasant can of worms that the Israelis would simply prefer to keep sealed. You never actually say whom you believe the actual assassins were who killed President Kennedy in Dallas. Who were they? I do point out in the book that there have been several names put forth as the possible \"French\" assassin in Dallas, most notably one Michael Mertz. He had ties to not only the French intelligence service and to the anti - DeGaulle forces in the OAS, but also to the Lansky - Trafficante drug smuggling network and to the so - called Corsican Mafia whose members were — in turn — fighting the OAS. So you see, this one possible assassin has ties in multiple directions to various factions in French intelli gence and to all of the very non - French elements that were working against JFK. There is strong evidence that anti - Castro Cuban exiles were involved in some way in the events in Dealey Plaza. We have the Novo brothers (Guillermo and Ignacio) whom former CI A contract operative Marita Lorenz says accompanied her to Dallas arriving the day before the assassination. We must not forget that the individual who was the \"handler\" for Miss Lorenz and the Novos was Frank Sturgis who worked for years for both the CIA and the Mossad and Sturgis himself later told Lorenz that his team was involved in the assassination, although he never said that they were the shooters, per se. Miss Lorenz testified that she had been told by Sturgis that she would be acting as a \"decoy\" in the operation and it wasn't until after the assassination that she realized her activities had brought her into the sphere of the assassination conspiracy. There were probably many people brought to Dallas as part of potential or possible assassination teams and who were never in fact utilized or who may have played some part, one way or another, either before or after the crime took place. In the end, the actual assassins were only \"trigger men\""},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"[526] Final Judgment 622 ] for people at much higher levels. What does matter is wh o ultimately planned the assassination. This is what really matters. Why don't you ever address such issues as where the shots were fired from or where the shots hit or what kind of bullets or weapons were used? Don't these elements, taken together, help solve the JFK assassination mystery? The bottom line is: \"Who killed John F. Kennedy and why?\" In Final Judgment I quoted long - time JFK assassination researcher Vincent Salandria who said: \"While the researchers have involved themselves in consuming preoc cupation with the microanalytic searching for facts of how the assassination was accomplished, there has been almost no systematic thinking on why President Kennedy was killed.\" I think that this summarizes it quite well. John F. Kennedy died that day in D allas. As a direct consequence of his death, U.S. foreign policy not only changed vis - à - vis Vietnam, but it also did a 180 - degree turn in the realm of American policy toward Israel and the Arab world. I think that the big problem with many JFK assassinatio n researchers is that they have failed to look in the direction of the Middle East controversy and that is a major problem they have failed to overcome. Those who are responsible for the murder of John F. Kennedy find nothing more amusing than the spectacl e of \"serious researchers\" tripping over one another and rehashing second, third and fourth - hand information, trying to determine where shots came from thirty years after the crime took place. This does nothing to resolve the controversy. Mark Lane proved in Rush to Judgment that there was much more to the story and subsequent books such as, notably, Josiah Thompson's Six Seconds in Dallas, analyzed the forensic aspects in a convincing fashion. However the question of conspiracy and cover - up was no longer i n doubt after such volumes appeared. Therefore we've known for thirty years that there was a conspiracy, that multiple assassins were involved. It doesn't matter how they carried out the crime, in the end, since the crime was a success. The weapons used in the crime have never been found and much of the autopsy and ballistic evidence that does exist may itself be forgeries. We are not likely to ever find a \"smoking gun\" that was bought by a known Mossad assassin either. So let's get away from trying to answ er questions that will never be answered and start looking into the connections of those who have been implicated in the conspiracy in some fashion or another: Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, Guy Banister, Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, the French assassins and many others. When we look into the connections of these well - known names, as I did in Final Judgment, you cannot help but keep tripping over the Israeli Connection. It is a connection that is ever - present. Why didn't anyone ever come across the Israel i connection to the JFK assassination before the publication of Final Judgment?"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"623 Questions & Answers [527] As I pointed out earlier, it wasn't until relatively recently that there was very much in the public domain about the difficult relations between John F. Kennedy and Israel. So most people wouldn't even know to look in the Israeli direction in the first place. When liberal author Richard Reeves appeared on the Pat Buchanan radio program touting his new history of the Kennedy administration, I phoned in and asked about JFK's Mi ddle East policy in the context of possible Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination. Reeves briefly acknowledged that JFK was engaged in a less - than - friendly state of affairs with Ben - Gurion but before I could pursue the matter further, Buchanan's co - host, Ben Wattenberg, a devotee of Israel, broke in — cutting me off the air, I might add — and switched the discussion to the subject of JFK's health. So much for JFK's Middle East policy! Why didn't New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison ever reveal Cl ay Shaw's ties to the Israelis and the Lansky Crime Syndicate through Shaw's membership in the Permindex board of directors? Garrison certainly knew about Permindex. I think this comes back to the fact that Garrison himself was evidently not initially cog nizant of the Israeli connection here, nor did he actually have any reason to suspect Israeli involvement, inasmuch as — at that time in the late 1960' s — JFK' s conflict with Israel was truly a deep, dark secret. However, as we now know, according to JFK res earcher A. J. Weberman, Garrison himself evidently later did come to the conclusion that there was a Mossad connection evidenced by his circulation of a manuscript for a novel (never published) in which he pinpointed the Mossad as the driving force behind the assassination conspiracy. As I have pointed out in Final Judgment, Garrison did not (at least at first) actually consider Shaw's ties to Permindex to be central to the events in Dallas. That suggests that Garrison missed the boat in a very big way sinc e he had stumbled on the key to Clay Shaw's intelligence connections and evidently did not understand them. One of my biggest regrets is that Jim Garrison didn't live long enough to read Final Judgment. As I mentioned earlier, those who did pinpoint the Pe rmindex Connection such as Dr. John Coleman and Executive Intelligence Review failed, however, in adequately exploring precisely why the Israelis themselves would have an interest in eliminating JFK. They did not examine JFK's Middle East policy and how th at policy was reversed upon JFK's death, not to mention the fact that JFK was trying to stop Israel from building the nuclear bomb, which, ultimately, was almost certainly the driving force behind Israel's involvement in the assassination conspiracy. Actua lly, after I finished writing Final Judgment I did come across two very old and relatively obscure published articles that actually pinpointed the role of the Mossad and the Lansky Crime Syndicate in the conspiracy. The one article had appeared at some poi nt in the 1980's in Metairie, Louisiana - based Christian Defense League Report and this article actually"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"[528] Final Judgment 624 encapsulated the basic thrust of the theory laid forth in Final Judgment in about ten paragraphs saying, essentially, that it was likely that the Isra elis had a hand in the JFK assassination because of JFK's problems with the Israelis and that the so - called \"Mafia\" — which is often blamed for the assassination — was in fact dominated by Israel's disciple, Meyer Lansky. I told Dr. James K. Warner of the Chri stian Defense League about this and told him that I had to give credit where credit was due. At the time Warner had even forgotten that the article had even been published! But it's interesting that this short article covered the subject quite well. I also have to give credit to the late Ned Touchstone, also of Louisiana, who was the publisher of a journal called The Councilor. Touchstone had actually done some investigating into the JFK assassination and I have now learned that it was Touchstone who was on e of the first people to stumble across CIA contract operative David Ferrie and this is discussed in some detail in Appendix Three. To Touchstone's credit, he did actually point out the high - level Israeli lobby connections of the powerful Stern family of N ew Orleans who were the owners of WDSU radio and television in New Orleans and close friends of Clay Shaw. As I thoroughly document in Final Judgment it was the Stern's WDSU outlets that were very much a part of the media effort that laid the groundwork fo r Lee Harvey Oswald's pre - assassination profile as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" It was Touchstone who suggested that somehow the Sterns might have been a key to the JFK assassination puzzle, but, obviously, he didn't have any firm evidence, perhaps again becau se no one actually knew how much of a problem had developed between JFK and the Israelis prior to the assassination. Touchstone first discovered the picture of Clay Shaw at a party sponsored by the Stern family's WDSU network in New Orleans. For many years people believed Ferrie was also in the picture. Recently, serious doubts have been raised as to whether Ferrie is actually the person shown in the photo with Shaw, but there have been other sources who have said that Shaw and Ferrie did know each other. S o whether it was Ferrie in the picture or not is largely irrelevant at this point in time. There is much more to be told about JFK's relationship with Israel. It wasn't until just recently, in 1995 in fact, — after the publication of Final Judgment — that the State Department released a massive volume of previously - unpublished documents relating to U.S. relations with Israel during the Kennedy administration. And these are documents that verify that JFK and Israeli Prime Minister Ben - Gurion were engaged in very bitter behind - the - scenes conflict over Israel's drive to build a nuclear weapon. The State Department volume, issued through the Government Printing Office, is Foreign Relations of the United States (1961 - 1963) Volume XVII - Near East (1961 - 1962). A sampl ing of the documents are cited in this edition of Final Judgment and do provide solid evidence of the bitter conflict between JFK and Ben - Gurion over Israel's nuclear bomb program. In addition, of course, Avner Cohen's new book, Israel and the Bomb, has pr ovided a vast wealth of new information about JFK's behind - the -"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"625 Questions & Answers [529] scenes war with Israel. Cohen has told people that he rejects my theory of Israeli involvement in the JFK conspiracy, there is no question but that his book (however unintentionally) gives c redibility to my thesis — whether Cohen likes it or not. There were many repetitions in Final Judgment. In many instances you told us what you would be telling us about in later chapters or referred to in previous chapters. Wouldn't the book be much more ef fective if you had an editor who would have deleted those repetitive references from the book? T his is an interesting question. Of my immediate circle of acquaintances who read the book either before publication or afterward, the repetition is something t hat they have almost all invariably commented upon when I asked them what they did like — or not like — about the book. As it was, actually, roughly seven out of ten of them said that they liked the repetition saying that it tied all of the complex subject mat ter together. The book itself is quite detailed and does attempt to tie together matters that initially do not appear to be related (although they most certainly are). So in the process of writing the book I made the conscious decision to try to tie all of these things together as often as possible. It would shorten the book if these repetitive references were edited, but for someone who was not familiar with a lot of the details of the JFK assassination, details about the history of JFK's relations with Is rael, details about Organized Crime, it may have been more difficult for them to understand the whole thesis were it not tied together in the repetitive fashion that I utilized. In any case, I do appreciate the critical comments from readers because it is always interesting to see how others view my work. Still, even in retrospect, despite some criticism from a number of people I know well and whose opinions I respect, I believe my judgment in this matter was correct. In Final Judgment you never precisely state whether it was the CIA or the Mossad that was the prime mover behind the JFK assassination. In other words, who do you believe was the \"senior partner\" in the JFK assassination conspiracy? You can't have it both ways. Was it the CIA or the Mossad? I don't know whether it was the CIA or the Mossad which was the prime mover behind the conspiracy. I would note that in the realm of U.S. policy in the Middle East the CIA and the Mossad were, as I've mentioned earlier, virtually two sides of the same coin. James J. Angleton, the Mossad's ally at the CIA, turned many CIA agents essentially into Mossad agents, working on behalf of Israel's interests, not only in the Middle East but throughout the world. In many cases there were no doubt many CIA operatives — an d CIA contract operatives, likewise — who were doing the work of the Mossad and didn't know it, not only in the matter of the JFK assassination but in various"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"[530] Final Judgment 626 covert activities globally. I do think the assassination conspiracy was largely a cooperative eff ort but I do believe that the Mossad connection was central to the conspiracy and actively endorsed and carried out with Angleton's prodding at the CIA in Washington. The assassination most likely would never have been carried out without the active collab oration of the CIA and obviously those in the CIA who were actively involved in the assassination conspiracy (Angleton in particular) were close to the Mossad or functioning in its sphere of influence in a number of areas. For example, CIA man E. Howard Hu nt, who was working closely with the anti - Castro Cubans and Guy Banister in New Orleans, was also a CIA liaison to the French OAS which, in turn, was working closely with the Israelis. Likewise with Banister, another major player in at least one aspect of the conspiracy: specifically the process of creating the legend of Lee Harvey Oswald, while he was living in New Orleans, as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" Then, of course, there's Frank Sturgis, who worked for both the CIA and the Mossad and who admitted to inv olvement in the assassination. So in many key instances where one appears to be finding a \"CIA connection\" to the JFK assassination conspiracy, one is also finding that it is also a very significant Israeli connection: whether you're talking about Banister , Sturgis, Hunt or — at a higher level — James Angleton. Not to mention long - time CIA asset Clay Shaw who was connected to the Israelis through the Mossad - sponsored Permindex operation. In a sense all of these key players were wearing two hats. In this particu lar realm of intelligence intrigue — the JFK assassination — when you are looking at the CIA you are also looking at the Mossad. In a situation such as this where you find various power groups interacting — in this case, a conspiracy to kill the president of the United States — you might find Ben - Gurion in Israel telling James Angleton at the CIA in Washington (whether directly or indirectly, of course): \"JFK is not only a threat to Israel, but he's also going to splinter the CIA into a million pieces and cast it t o the wind. He's going to wreck your plans to get deeper into Vietnam.\" At the same time Ben - Gurion's lobbyists might be whispering in the ears of defense contractors' lobbyists in Washington saying, for example: \"You won't have your big money profits if J FK gets out of Vietnam. And if LBJ comes into office, we have it on good authority that he's going to begin a major highly profitable process of arming Israel. But none of this will happen if JFK stays around much longer.\" So the defense contractors turn a round and tell their friends in the CIA and the Pentagon: \"This son of a bitch Kennedy has got to go.\" This is highly simplistic, of course — but nonetheless instructive — way of looking at how the process of the assassination conspiracy began developing. Obvi ously, Angleton and his associates at the CIA didn't need Ben - - Gurion to tell them what a problem JFK was for the CIA. But it certainly didn't hurt for Angleton to know that he'd have the clout and the political"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"627 Questions & Answers [531] protection — not to mention the assistance — o f Israel and its worldwide network and its support in the American media if he and the CIA decided to move against President Kennedy. All in all you had a very tightly knit group of people — both outright conspirators and powerful sympathizers — all dealing wi th one another on a regular and intimate and highly secretive basis. I've said time and again that while the JFK assassination conspiracy appears on its face to be many different circles intersecting with one another, a more appropriate way of looking at t he conspiracy would be to view it as a very wide circle that continues spiraling inward to a very tight vortex. You don't have \"one big happy family\" but, instead, \"one very small happy family\" collaborating in the JFK conspiracy. With just a few contacts, these people were capable of setting in motion, financing and orchestrating this conspiracy that obviously crossed several continents. We will never know who first said, \"Let's kill JFK.\" It would be presumptuous for me to try to make any comment on that and obviously no records on this conspiracy were kept. In Oliver Stone's JFK, the character played by Donald Sutherland, known as \"Man X\" said that he felt the conspiracy started \"in the wind.\" Kennedy, he said, was like Caesar, surrounded with enemies. So mething was underway. Yet everybody in the loop knew what was going to happen — that JFK was going to be assassinated. It was a coup d'etat – and that's how they work. That's the best way to look at how the conspiracy evolved. According to Pierre Neuville, my French source, Yitzhak Shamir, the Mossad's assassination chief, did contract out at least one assassin or an assassination team through Colonel Georges deLannurien in French intelligence. And because deLannurien was with Angleton at CIA headquarters at La ngley the day of the assassination, it seems likely that deLannurien knew precisely who those contract assassins were gunning for. He doesn't appear to be have been \"out of the loop.\" So, in my judgment, there was an affirmative move on the part of the Mos sad toward the goal of killing John F. Kennedy. Perhaps Shamir did it at Angleton's behest. There's no doubt that it was JFK's strained relationship with Israel that was one of the prime motivations behind the ultimate conspiracy in light of the role of Is rael's CIA collaborator, James Angleton, in the conspiracy. Angleton had several motivations in launching CIA participation in the conspiracy and one of the primary motivations certainly was his position as Israel's chief and devoted advocate at the CIA in Washington. I think my bottom line in Final Judgment is that you absolutely cannot look at the JFK assassination conspiracy without factoring in the role of the Mossad — all other factors, no matter how important, notwithstanding. In Final Judgment you say very little about the role of the military - industrial complex and its allies in the Pentagon in the JFK assassination conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"[532] Final Judgment 628 Frankly, I've always looked at the theory that \"the military - industrial complex killed JFK\" as being somewhat of a cop - out theory. When you blame the military - industrial complex (so - called) you are blaming faceless industrialists, faceless military men, faceless financiers. It's a cloudy, gray area with few specifics. However, if you wish to resort to the terminology of talkin g about the \"military - industrial complex\" that still does encompass quite an expanse of various power groups but they are all inter - related. The fact is that the Israeli lobby is a key component of the military - industrial complex, today in particular. This wasn't so much the case in JFK's day, but the Israeli lobby was beginning to flex its muscles at that time and as a direct result of JFK's death, the military - industrial complex began building the weapons that Israel began receiving in large number when L BJ reversed JFK's Middle East policy LBJ not only began arming Israel to the teeth but also providing a massive infusion of foreign aid to Israel that the Jewish state used to purchase the weapons of war built by the faceless demons in the \"military - indust rial complex.\" I'm aware of at least one lobbyist for the Israeli defense industry who has also lobbied on behalf of some major American defense contractors during that period — and for the CIA. And he's not the only one. So the military - industrial complex d id not only benefit immensely from the war in Vietnam. These faceless industrialists also had a great stake in the arming of Israel, any way you cut it. Those who want to point the finger of blame at \"the military - industrial complex\" for the death of JFK h ad better start pointing out the fact that Israel and its American lobby are very much a part of that very popular bogeyman in the lore of the JFK assassination conspiracy. There are a lot of people among JFK assassination researchers who might be frighten ed to mention the role of Israel in the military - industrial complex, but that element is there, whether they want to admit it or not. Is the conspiracy that you outline in Final Judgment a \"right wing conspiracy\" or a \"left wing conspiracy\"? I don't thin k that the terms \"right wing\" and \"left wing\" have very much meaning anymore and I don't think that you can use this terminology in reference to the JFK assassination whatsoever. There are many more factors at work in the conspiracy. The elements in the CI A who were conspiring against JFK in one fashion or another — specifically James Angleton, David Atlee Phillips, chief of the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division, E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis and such lower - level figures as Guy Banister and David Ferrie in Ne w Orleans, not to mention many of the Cuban exiles who were working for the CIA were \"right wingers\" and \"anti - communists.\" However, the fact is that the government of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion was a left wing, socialist regime under the rule of the Labor Party. So you found the right - wingers in the CIA working with the left - wingers in Israel."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"629 Questions & Answers [533] What you had was a conspiracy of power politics: a variety of special interests working together. You also had the Lansky - dominated \"Mafia\" elements w ho were concerned about the Kennedy administration's war on organized crime and who were also helping finance the anti - Castro Cuban exiles on a variety of fronts. And as many people know even \"the Mafia\" financed Castro himself in the beginning, hoping to be in his good graces if and when he came to power. So there were definitely a lot of conflicting forces at work. I might add also that even within the anti - Castro Cuban exile community, which has the general profile among many JFK assassination researcher s as being \"right wing,\" the fact is that there were actually many \"left wingers\" who were opposed to Castro. There were many factions within the Cuban community. In fact, a lot of veterans of the anti - Castro wars of the early 1960's even perceived \"right winger\" E. Howard Hunt to be sympathetic to the left wing elements among the anti - Castro Cubans. The liberal - oriented among those in the JFK assassination research community do not understand this, but it is definitely a factor to be considered. So you can 't even really pinpoint the CIA itself as being \"right wing\" or \"left wing\" when you really begin analyzing the situation. There are many old CIA hands who are bitter even today about the influence of the \"liberals\" in the CIA's factional squabbles involvi ng the war against Fidel Castro. Let's get away from these terms such as \"left wing\" and \"right wing\" and view the JFK assassination conspiracy as an alliance among diverse interests (many of which intersected) but all of whom stood to benefit from the ass assination of President Kennedy. Isn't it possible, in the end, that the Soviet KGB — or some faction within the KGB — was actually behind the JFK assassination conspiracy, manipulating \"right wingers\" in the CIA and among the anti - Castro Cuban exiles and eve n in the mob and the Mossad? Yes, it's entirely possible, but highly unlikely. In the world of intelligence anything is possible. Things are not always as they appear to be. But let's look at the Soviet motivation in general. What motivation would the Sov iets have in killing JFK and substituting Lyndon Johnson as the American president? LBJ, in a sense, had a reputation of being even more anti - communist than JFK. It's highly unlikely that they would have preferred LBJ over his predecessor. I've never seen anyone put forth anything even bearing a semblance of credibility that would prove this. It's possible that there may have been somebody somewhere in the midst of the JFK assassination conspiracy who was somehow a KGB double agent, but obviously there was so much over - lapping of the various intelligence agencies in this conspiracy that it's possible that there was even an Irish secret agent mixed up in the conspiracy, wittingly or unwittingly. As Mark Lane pointed out in Plausible Denial, the effort to blam e the assassination on the KGB was one of the many cover stories laid down by the real conspirators. Perhaps the KGB cover story was one of several that"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"[534] Final Judgment 630 the actual conspirators were holding back in the event that they needed some trump card. And you will recall that it was James Angleton who was the CIA official who was the loudest advocate of the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald was, at the very least, a \"pro - Castro agitator\" who was busy meeting in Mexico with a KGB assassinations expert. In his book, The Man Who Knew Too Much, author Dick Russell paints a very plausible case that a long - time U.S. intelligence operative, Richard Case Nagell, may have been under the direction of the KGB in an attempt to infiltrate the assassination conspiracy. Nagell does ap pear to have been enmeshed in various aspects of the conspiracy, but that doesn't mean that the KGB was manipulating the conspiracy but was instead monitoring a conspiracy or conspiracies — and they may not have even initially known that it was an assassinat ion conspiracy. Do you absolutely discount any involvement in the assassination by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro? Absolutely. I don't think there's any doubt that Castro himself would have realized what a drastic, drastic mistake it would have been for him self to even be implicated in any aspect of any conspiracy even vaguely associated with the assassination or attempted assassination of John F. Kennedy. Fidel Castro is not stupid. Were it ever pinned on Castro, there undoubtedly would have been a national and international demand for Castro's head. So Castro obviously had no interest in driving a stake through John F. Kennedy's heart. We know now, many years later, that JFK was moving toward a form of detente with Castro, but at the same time, it seems, JF K was no doubt keeping his options open vis - à - vis the Cuban leader. However, it's very clear that the real conspirators behind the assassination who were manipulating Lee Harvey Oswald were doing so in such a fashion as to make it appear as though he were a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" What does that say? If Castro were behind the conspiracy, he certainly wouldn't have manipulated Oswald in such a fashion. If Castro had any inkling that there had been an assassination conspiracy afoot, it would have been in Castr o's interests to call it to JFK's attention. Castro knew nothing of a conspiracy. We can discount any involvement by Castro. Isn't it possible that \"rogue elements\" in both the CIA and the Mossad were involved in the JFK assassination and that high - level CIA and Mossad people had nothing to do with the conspiracy? No, it is not possible that the JFK assassination was orchestrated by \"rogue elements\" of the CIA and the Mossad. The \"rogue element\" cop - out is tired and worn. When we look at those in the CIA who were involved in strange activities relating to the assassination — particularly the effort to suggest that Lee Harvey Oswald was meeting with a KGB assassinations specialist in Mexico City — we find not only David Atlee Phillips, chief of the CIA's Wester n Hemisphere Division but also, of course, James"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"631 Questions & Answers [535] Angleton, the CIA's director for counterintelligence. These are not \"low level\" operatives who went astray. These are men at the top. There's no question about it. What about somebody such as E. Howard Hun t? Although Hunt was certainly lower on the CIA totem pole than Phillips or Angleton, he was still very much a long - time CIA figure who had played a major role in the CIA's clandestine affairs. Hunt, likewise, was no \"rogue\" operative. There is no evidence that John McCone — a longtime Kennedy family friend — who was JFK's appointee as CIA director (replacing Allen Dulles, who had been fired by JFK), had anything to do with the conspiracy. In fact, as noted in Final Judgment, McCone himself was a bitter critic of Israel's nuclear bomb program and earlier, at the close of the Eisenhower administration where he was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, it was McCone who first leaked the truth about Israel's nuclear intentions. It's interesting to note that whe n the Kennedy administration ordered the CIA to begin spying on Israel's secret nuclear development program, the spying was being done out of McCone's office. In other words, JFK did not trust the spying operation to be conducted by Angleton, whom everyone knew was a co - opted agent of Israel in the CIA, but JFK did trust McCone. So although McCone had nothing to do with JFK's assassination, those who surrounded him at the highest levels certainly did. Nor should one forget that many of the people in the CIA at the time of the JFK murder remained loyal to long - time director Allen Dulles who had been sacked by Kennedy. The CIA's involvement in the assassination was very much an institutional response to JFK who had threatened to splinter the CIA and cast it to the winds. All of this is not to suggest that there was a general staff meeting at the CIA one day when John McCone was out with a head cold where Angleton announced, \"We're going to kill the president. Let's work together on this and keep Mr. McCone out of the loop.\" Things don't work that way. The actual conspirators in the loop were a tightly - knit group with vast resources at their command, including not just the CIA bureaucracy and its infamous black budget, but they also had the skills of the Mossad n etwork on call. What's more, with the CIA's inter - action with peripheral groups such as the anti - Castro Cuban exiles, not to mention contacts in organized crime, there were enough people who could be manipulated in enough ways that t h e y w o u l d n ' t e v e n n e c e s s a r i l y k n o w t h a t t h e y w e r e b e i n g manipulated — and implicated. And once those people were implicated, it was in their interests to not only shut up, but help cover up. There were undoubtedly many people in the CIA and elsewhere who were involved in some aspe ct of the conspiracy who had no idea that they were being used to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating JFK. As far as the Mossad is concerned, Mossad operatives could not have acted without the direct orders of Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion and Mossa d assassinations chief Yitzhak Shamir. The Mossad is actually a very small organization institutionally, as former Mossad operative Victor Ostrovsky has pointed out. It is even more tightly knit than the CIA. In fact,"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"[536] Final Judgment 632 according to Ostrovsky there is what one might call an assassinations \"board of directors\" within the Mossad and no assassination can be orchestrated by the Mossad without a formal vote of approval by this board. There's another important thing to remember here: it is highly unlikely that th e Mossad — at least at that juncture in history — would have ever considered killing the president of the United States unless it knew that it had the institutional consent of the CIA, at the very least. Israel's position was highly precarious in 1963 and for the Mossad — or even so - called \"rogue elements\" of the Mossad — to attempt the assassination of the American president without the assurance that it had the support of the CIA, for example, would have been a rash move indeed. So there were no \"rogue\" Mossad el ements involved in the assassination of JFK. At this juncture, I suppose, it's appropriate to comment further on James Jesus Angleton. Although there is no question that, by personal choice (for whatever reason), Angleton was a devout friend of Zionism and the state of Israel and that he used all resources at his command to influence CIA decision - making on Israel's behalf. Whether he was blackmailed or not, however, the fact remains that Angleton was Israel's primary advocate at the CIA. He was a powerful, secretive man who was also a key player in much of the CIA's worldwide intrigue in a variety of areas where he dealt on a close and sustained basis with figures tied, in turn, to the Mossad and to the Lansky Crime Syndicate. Angleton was no \"rogue.\" He was the CIA's most influential — if controversial — spymaster and one of the most remarkable characters in the bizarre and fascinating history of that agency. And he was also one of those individuals most directly responsible for initiating and orchestrating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Where do the anti - Castro Cuban exiles fit in the JFK conspiracy? The Cubans were at the bottom rung of the ladder. They were low - level functionaries, perhaps the lowest of all. There may have actually been a Cu ban who pulled a trigger in Dallas. Former CIA contract operative Marita Lorenz (who went to Dallas with a caravan of Cubans arriving just prior to the assassination) has pointed out that she was told by her CIA handler in Dallas that she was supposed to f unction as a \"decoy\" and it seems likely to me that many of the Cubans who were enmeshed in the assassination scenario were acting as such. The Cubans have proven to be an excellent \"false flag\" for the real conspirators for there were many false trails be ing laid to make it appear as though the chosen patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" Who better to be positioned to manipulate Oswald in that fashion and play the part in framing Oswald than the anti - Castro Cubans who would obviously see the benefit in such a measure? As I point out in Final Judgment, long - time CIA contract operative Jerry Patrick Hemming who was close to the anti - Castro Cubans has said that the Cubans were being manipulated themselves and that they have come to realize th at. I contend, of course, that they were being manipulated by the CIA and the Mossad who were leading the Cubans to believe that"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"633 Questions & Answers [537] they were playing a role in avenging JFK for the Bay of Pigs, for example, when there was much, much more really at stake. It 's worth noting, also, that French intelligence was intimately involved in the Cuban situation during that period, although this is not well known. There were French elements on both sides of the conflict. So it's conceivable that the Mossad was also using its allies in French intelligence to manipulate the Cuban underground during this time frame. This is a subject that some JFK assassination researcher might wish to explore further. It might be grist for a very interesting book. If somebody came up with ironclad evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed the lone assassin in Dallas who fired all of the shots that were fired, doesn't that totally demolish your theory? If somebody came up with such \"evidence\" I would say that it was forged. Be that as it m ay, however, no one will ever come up with such evidence. However, granting the argument that Oswald, for example, was the only gunman that would not, by any means, discount my basic theory. Bear in mind that there is no question that Lee Harvey Oswald was associating with (and being manipulated by) people who had links to both the CIA and the Mossad. In the case of Oswald's New Orleans associate, Guy Banister, who was \"sheep - dipping\" Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator,\" Banister had links to the Israeli - supp orted French OAS. At any rate, even if Oswald had been the \"lone gunman\" and managed to have carried off the assassination on his own, the fact is that Oswald was then a lone gunman who was successfully utilized by his manipulators at a higher level who we re acting on behalf of the CIA and the Mossad. It's as simple as that. Is it possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was brainwashed and was some sort of \"Manchurian Candidate\" and a victim of mind control? This is entirely possible. This is not an area that I h ave explored in any real detail, nor is it any area that I expect to pursue. Nor do I think it is ultimately vital to resolving the mystery of who killed JFK and why. The bottom line is that, however it came about, Oswald was ultimately the \"patsy\" as he h imself described his situation when in police custody. I think, at this juncture, it is important to note that the CIA's mind control programs which were being utilized at the time of the JFK assassination were, in fact, under the direct control of James J . Angleton's counterintelligence division. So if Oswald were a Manchurian Candidate under the discipline of the CIA's mind control operations, it once again leads back to Israel's highly placed disciple at the CIA. Although Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who was the chief technician in the CIA's mind control programs, has gotten all the public exposure, Gottlieb himself was working directly under Angleton. If Oswald was a Manchurian Candidate, he was Angleton's Manchurian Candidate."},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"[538] Final Judgment 634 What role do you think Oswald pl ayed (other than \"patsy\") in the JFK assassination? Was Oswald aware, in advance, of a conspiracy to kill JFK? Is it possible that he was helping the conspiracy, perhaps as a loyal CIA man, for example, not knowing that he was slated to be the patsy? Was h e a CIA operative or an FBI operative or what? These are questions that will probably never be resolved. Oswald was indeed the patsy. It's always been my opinion, however, that there were probably other people in Dallas on November 22, 1963 who were possi ble alternative patsies — others who had already been \"sheep - dipped\" as had been done with Oswald. The people responsible for setting up these other patsies may have been those who had set up Oswald — or perhaps not. Was Oswald one of the shooters in Dallas? I don't believe that Oswald fired a loaded round at either John F. Kennedy or John Connally, if indeed he fired any weapon that day. My general feeling is that Oswald may have been roped into the conspiracy by being told that it was a \"dummy\" assassination attempt to scare the American people into thinking that action was needed against Fidel Castro. Oswald may have been instructed to bring a rifle to the Texas School Book Depository (from where the Warren Commission claims Oswald fired the fatal shots). Whe ther it was his own rifle or another rifle or whether that weapon was actually used to fire any of the shots we will probably never know. (There are some who question whether or not Oswald was actually the person who obtained the alleged assassination weap on through the mail to begin with!) It seems likely to me that Oswald knew that there was something going on in Dealey Plaza that day that may have involved, at the very least, the firing of rifles. I doubt that Oswald actually thought that the rifles woul d be trained on either JFK or John Connally. I strongly suspect Oswald was a little bit surprised, to put it lightly, when he learned that the president had been hit by gunfire. Was he aware of a conspiracy to kill JFK? As I've already suggested, I don't t hink that he was aware of such a conspiracy. Instead, he probably believed he was part of some \"set up\" that had been orchestrated by JFK himself. Or, as I've suggested, he may have thought it was being arranged by the CIA to make JFK have second thoughts about Castro. Who knows? A new book by Professor John Newman, Oswald and the CIA, tells us very much about Oswald and the CIA, citing many intelligence documents, but it also tells us very little. All it really tells us is that the CIA and other government agencies had an interest in Lee Harvey Oswald for some time. This is no surprise. However, as Newman does make very clear, it was Angleton's division at the CIA that was ever - present, it seems, when the CIA was assembling information on Oswald. In short, Angleton knew who Lee Harvey Oswald was — long before the assassination. (Actually, in retrospect, it may have been Angleton who dreamed up the idea for selecting Lee Harvey Oswald as the patsy. Quite likely, I would say.)"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"635 Questions & Answers [539] After all, Oswald was a former U. S. Marine who had ostensibly \"defected\" to the Soviet Union — not a common venture, by any means. So obviously the CIA would have had an interest in Oswald – whether he was a genuine defector at the time or not. And if Oswald's defection was genuine, it is ent irely conceivable that he did a turn - about and then went to work for the CIA rather than against it. So as much as I am sorry to say, I don't think that John Newman has contributed anything substantial in his new book. Everything he's told us we've already known about for years. People have been arguing for years that Oswald was recruited as a Marine to work for the CIA. And there are those who say that he was not actually recruited as a phony \"defector\" by the CIA but instead by the Office of Naval Intelli gence. Then again, it's entirely possible that he was working for some other secret government agency that was running agents into the USSR. Was Oswald an FBI contract operative of some sort? Because of Oswald's profile as a \"defector\" — whether genuine or n ot — it is no surprise that the FBI would have an interest in Oswald. If Oswald was a CIA - sponsored \"defector\" the FBI might not necessarily have known that and may have believed that Oswald was \"the real thing,\" so to speak, and upon his return may have put him under surveillance for that very reason. And if Oswald had been a genuine defector who ultimately recanted upon his return to the United States, it is possible that he volunteered his services to the FBI or was actually recruited by the bureau. Shortl y after the assassination a story circulated that Oswald may have been on the FBI's payroll as an informant, but there's a good deal of evidence to suggest that this story simply isn't true at all. However, if the story isn't true it has still taken on a l ife of its own and frequently pops up in literature about the JFK assassination. The very fact that Oswald was working for Guy Banister in New Orleans does put him in the FBI's sphere of influence, inasmuch as Banister was a long - time high - ranking FBI offi cial. The Banister connection also puts Oswald in the CIA's sphere of influence, not to mention that of Naval Intelligence (ONI), inasmuch as Banister was also not only a CIA contract operative, but, additionally, formerly with the ONI. There have been tho se who have suggested that perhaps Oswald was even working as a Treasury Department informant, investigating the inter - state sales of firearms. There have been some who have devoted a great deal of research to this topic. My own inclination is that the CIA connection (through Banister) is the area that we need to focus on and I will discuss that further in a moment. However, it is likely that if Oswald's work for Banister was being coordinated by the CIA, Oswald himself didn't know it. Ultimately what we fi nd is that Oswald was operating in many spheres of influence and for that reason alone he was an ideal patsy since he could be pinned to any or all of the different groups which then, in turn, would have reason to want to cover - up their association with an alleged presidential assassin."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"[540] Final Judgment 636 I do believe that there is strong evidence, which has appeared in more than one book on the JFK assassination, that there were people posing as Lee Harvey Oswald. However, it seems unlikely that those imposters knew that t hey were doing so for the purpose of furthering an aspect of the assassination conspiracy. The assassination conspiracy would be far too compartmentalized for every participant in some aspect of the conspiracy to know precisely how he was being manipulated or utilized in the framing of Oswald. Some of those imposters probably never laid their eyes on Oswald and probably didn't know who he was until after the real Oswald was picked up by the Dallas police. In Final Judgment I believe that I broke serious new ground by pointing out that Oswald's association with Guy Banister may indeed point to a possible role by the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith (an arm of Israel's Mossad) in the \"sheep - dipping\" of Oswald as a \"pro - Castro agitator.\" In light of Banister's close relationship with A. L. (Bee) Botnick of the New Orleans office of the ADL, we have to seriously ponder the question of whether or not Banister's use of Oswald had been arranged by the ADL which frequently contracted out \"fact finding\" wo rk through private detective agencies such as that of Banister's in New Orleans. This is something that we should address. Although Banister's historical profile is one of a \"right - wing anti - communist racist extremist\" etc etc (a profile that the \"liberal\" JFK assassination researchers like to portray), the fact is that Banister worked closely with the New Orleans ADL office. By all accounts, A. L. Botnick was an \"anti - communist extremist\" with a known hostility toward the Black civil rights movement, the A DL's public posturing as a \"civil rights\" group notwithstanding. Although Botnick himself was not in the New Orleans ADL office in 1963 (having transferred to its Atlanta office, later returning to New Orleans in 1963), Banister certainly retained his very valuable ties to the ADL. My own feeling about Oswald's \"sheep - dipping\" by Banister is that Banister's ADL associates were looking into left - wing groups such as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and upon this basis they could have deployed Oswald into the pro - Castro movement, part of a deliberate attempt to portray Oswald as a Castroite. That is, Oswald thought that he was working for Banister when, in fact, he was acting as a \"fact finder\" for the ADL. Banister himself may have been told that the ADL wante d \"facts\" about the pro - Castro movement and that Oswald was the man for the job. Banister himself may not have even known that Oswald was being sheep - dipped for his ultimate role in the Kennedy assassination. So it may have come as a surprise to Banister h imself when Oswald was named as the assassin. In retrospect I don't think that Banister himself was as central to the actual assassination conspiracy, in this regard, as many have believed over the years. Banister himself was, in that sense, a \"useful idio t\" in the employ of the ADL and the Mossad and its CIA allies. I would even go so far as to say that it seems likely that even Banister's friends at the ADL had no idea that Oswald was being slated for the role of patsy in the assassination."},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"637 Questions & Answers [541] Peter Dale S cott, the prominent JFK assassination researcher, has pointed out (as I noted in Final Judgment) that you can look at Oswald's role as an employee of Banister and find various explanations for it: on the one hand you can view Oswald as a functionary of the intelligence community (in light of Banister's intelligence connections); on the other hand you can also view Oswald as a patsy of \"the Mafia\" in light of the fact that New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello provided financing for the anti - Castro Cuban ex iles through Banister's CIA operations. However, Scott himself acknowledges that this whole interplay between these interest groups through the Banister connection is part of a \"gray\" area representing the underbelly of finance and politics and internation al intrigue in New Orleans at the time. I believe very strongly that the likely involvement of the ADL in manipulating Oswald through Banister is one of the unexplored areas of the JFK assassination — one that will probably, unfortunately, never be explored by JFK researchers any more than it has already been explored in Final Judgment. Let's not expect to find any ADL files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The bottom line is that Lee Harvey Oswald himself probably didn't know precisely who he was working for and that i s the way the assassination planners wanted it. Oswald is probably one of the most - discussed and most - analyzed individuals in history, but we will never know who he really was or what his motivations were. It is conceivable that Oswald thought he was playi ng a double or triple game and fooling everybody and was even more of a patsy than we realize. He's a tragic figure any way you cut it — and an ideal patsy. There is an interesting parallel, in this context, that should be noted as an aside. It's been report ed that Oswald was fascinated and inspired by the 1950's television series, I Led Three Lives, the story of an undercover agent for the FBI inside the Communist Party. This also apparently inspired another undercover intelligence operative — Roy Bullock — who was exposed in 1993 as a long - time agent for the ADL. Inspired by the book, Bullock went to the ADL and volunteered to infiltrate \"hate groups.\" He also made similar volunteer efforts for the FBI. In addition, he also worked for the Indianapolis police dep artment. In fact, in 1957 Bullock went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow as an undercover informant and reported back to the FBI. As a consequence of that, it's quite possible that there's a CIA file on Bullock as a possible \"subversi ve\" if the FBI never let the CIA in on the fact that Bullock was their boy. Now in light of the fact that Bullock was infiltrating both \"left wing\" and \"right wing\" groups over the years, Bullock himself would have been an ideal patsy. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Dick Russell has exposed the possibility that there were a number of people who were being groomed as possible JFK assassination patsies due to their association with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, of which Oswald was ostensibly the New Orlean s chapter head."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"[542] Final Judgment 638 Another long - time international intelligence adventurer, Colonel Robert K. Brown (now best known as the publisher of Soldier of Fortune magazine) was himself reportedly a Chicago Police Department infiltrator in the Chicago branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee around the same time that Lee Harvey Oswald was running around in New Orleans. This is interesting, too, in that Brown himself has long - time connections to Israeli intelligence. I would be thrilled to see someone follow through on that little tidbit that seems to have gone right by the JFK assassination researchers. This matter of \"defectors\" and \"infiltrators\" and \"undercover agents\" is very complex and one can't always determine the motivations of someone operating in this unu sual netherworld. It's a combination of personal psychology coupled with the ability of the handlers to manipulate a person's activities without letting them know who they are working for or why. What role did George DeMohrenschildt, the White Russian nob leman often said to be Lee Harvey Oswald's \"CIA babysitter\" in Dallas, play in the assassination conspiracy? The colorful DeMohrenschildt is probably one of the most interesting characters to cross the stage in the drama known as the JFK assassination con troversy. I'm not convinced that DeMohrenschildt was a conscious player in any assassination conspiracy. It's apparent that DeMohrenschildt did have quite a bit of contact and interplay with the CIA and other intelligence agencies over the years and he evi dently did speak with a CIA official who asked him to keep an eye on Oswald when the latter came to Dallas after returning from the Soviet Union. In this particular instance, however, it could have been a routine matter of no great consequence that, in the end, had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination itself. As we've noted, because of Oswald's \"defector\" status — whether genuine or not — the intelligence agencies had an obvious interest in Oswald. I have seen no evidence to suggest that DeMohrenschi ldt had any foreknowledge of any conspiracy to \"sheep dip\" Lee Harvey Oswald for the purposes of the assassination conspiracy per se. However, it is probable that DeMohrenschildt did indeed function in some capacity as one of those who were part of the con spiracy to manipulate Oswald into the role of patsy. So in that sense, he was \"baby - sitting\" Oswald, but there were others who also had that same responsibility. Remember that Oswald had left Dallas for New Orleans in the summer of 1963 and the actual cont act between Oswald and DeMohrenschildt ended even earlier when DeMohrenschildt left the country, ostensibly for business in Haiti. Some have suggested that DeMohrenschildt's activities in Haiti may have had something to do with the JFK assassination, but I have yet to see any firm evidence of that. Obviously, however, when DeMohrenschildt went to Haiti his immediate control and/or supervision of Oswald came to an end. There were others who picked up that responsibility. I find it interesting, though, that w hile JFK assassination researchers go hog - wild over DeMohrenchildt's ties with the CIA they often pass by the"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"639 Questions & Answers [543] fact that he was also linked to French intelligence. So in light of the French Connection that I document in Final Judgment, this, in fact, coul d have brought DeMohrenschildt into the Mossad sphere of influence. Another thing worth mentioning is that I've actually seen some JFK \"authorities\" portray DeMohrenschildt as some sort of \"anti - communist extremist\" because, I presume, of his White Russian background. On the contrary, despite his background, it seems that DeMohrenschildt was evidently not much interested in communism or anti - communism one way or another and was actually a bit of an outcast in the White Russian community. So those who want t o make him part of some \"right wing anti - communist conspiracy\" are actually way off the mark. DeMohrenschildt wore many hats, but there's no real evidence of any complicity by DeMohrenschildt in the JFK assassination. He may have known something — or perhaps discovered it by accident, either before or after the assassination or perhaps realized in retrospect that he did indeed know something he wasn't supposed to know. It is apparent, based upon the historical record compiled by those who had contact with DeM ohrenschildt that after the assassination DeMohrenschildt realized that he, too, had been used in some fashion to \"control\" or \"handle\" Oswald. Maybe DeMohrenschildt's \"suicide\" really was murder. Maybe he was killed because he did \"know something.\" And I do have to point out that the last person who was supposed to have seen DeMohrenschildt before his death was none other than Edward Jay Epstein, a student - turned - journalist who was close to the Mossad's man at the CIA, James Jesus Angleton. (Epstein, as I' ve noted in Final Judgment, was the leading literary promoter of Angleton's cover story that the Soviets were linked to the JFK assassination.) Now rest assured that I'm not suggesting Epstein pulled the trigger on DeMohrenschildt. But I do find it interes ting that he was the last person who has publicly admitted to having seen DeMohrenschildt. An author of spy fiction could spin a fascinating yarn out of that scenario. I would like to add something in closing. I think that, in the end, JFK assassination re searchers could probably find out more about who really was manipulating Oswald by looking into Michael and Ruth Paine, the young couple in Dallas, with whom the Oswald family lived in the period preceding the assassination. There have been several JFK res earchers who have made noises about the Paines, but I think if one pursued the matter further, one would find, ultimately, that the Paines — more so in the end than the ubiquitous and enigmatic DeMohrenschildt — were functioning as \"CIA babysitters\" for Oswald . I tend to think that the Paine story is a story that does need further exploration and I would encourage some energetic young researcher to follow through on it. I probably should note that biographical information about Mrs. Paine, supplied by Priscilla Johnson McMillan in her book Marina and Lee, has documented Mrs. Paine's involvement at one time in the activities of a Jewish community center, so this non - Jewish Quaker woman — Mrs."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"[544] Fina l Judgment 640 Paine — did have such ties herself. It would be interesting to document p recisely how deeply Mrs. Paine's views toward Israel went. Some people have suspected Mrs. Paine of having CIA connections. Is it possible, also that she had Mossad connections? Who knows? Just some speculation. Did Lee Harvey Oswald actually fire a shot (prior to the JFK assassination) at Major General Edwin Walker who was, himself, a prominent \"right wing\" critic of President Kennedy? Did General Walker have some hand in the assassination conspiracy? General Walker was a fierce anti - communist and the \"l iberal\" JFK assassination researchers have tried — but failed — to somehow tie Walker into the JFK assassination conspiracy. Walker's \"role\" in the affair stems from the fact that the Warren Report claimed that Oswald had taken a shot at Walker shortly before the assassination and this, the report claimed, was \"evidence\" of Oswald's felonious tendencies. However, if Oswald had never been linked to that attack on General Walker, the good general's name would probably never have been connected in any way to the J FK controversy! People seem to forget that. In his book, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Dick Russell has traced some strange activities to people surrounding General Walker and, in fact, these people may have had some connection to Oswald. It appears as though General Walker himself may have been being set up as some sort of \"right wing patsy\" in the JFK assassination conspiracy. I almost hate to bring this fact up, but the clique of young military men who placed themselves around Walker — proclaiming themselves an outfit called \"Conservativism USA\" — were some five Jewish boys who came out of the US Army in Europe. This is according to Dick Russell, writing in his mammoth study, The Man Who Knew Too Much. As I've noted, there were probably a number of patsies being set up in Dallas and the people setting them up probably didn't know the JFK assassination was in the offing. It appears, at least based upon what Dick Russell has written, that this clique around Walker may have been manipulating Oswald in some way. Alth ough many JFK assassination researchers and others have heard about the \"right wing\" Jewish boy, Bernard Weissmann, who took out the full page ad attacking President Kennedy in the Dallas newspaper on November 22, what none have noted — with the exception of Russell's passing reference — is that these young \"right wing\" military boys were Jewish. So here's another \"Jewish connection\" that seems to have been lost in the shuffle. Leave it to me to bring up this fact in the context of what I've uncovered. I hate t o do it. Oswald himself was evidently moving in circles that were connected to Walker but only those who want to portray the crime as being a \"right wing conspiracy\" believe that Walker had a hand in the assassination. Walker himself said in later years th at there were some strange things going on around him that he didn't fully understand and that probably indicates precisely what I've suggested: that he and his associates were potential fall - guys in the assassination. So who was setting Walker up?"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"641 Questions & Answers [545] What about the role of the Minute Men and other \"right wing extremists\" in the conspiracy? Guy Banister was tied to the Minute Men. And isn't it true that a right - winger named Joseph Milteer knew in advance that JFK was going to be shot from a high building and that Milteer was in Dallas for the assassination? This is another popular distraction that has kept JFK assassination researchers busy. Milteer was not one of the masterminds of the JFK assassination conspiracy nor was he a player in the actual plot to k ill JFK that ultimately succeeded. It is conceivable Milteer did have some knowledge about an alleged plot to kill JFK in Miami. Information may have been leaked to Milteer by one of the low - level conspirators about some plot and he may have wanted to thin k, being a Kennedy hater, that he was \"on the inside\" of some conspiracy, but you can be certain that he was not. Milteer bragged of his \"knowledge\" to a police informant and that \"knowledge,\" actually, may have been disinformation leaked to Milteer in ord er to distract attention from the real conspiracy. Milteer may have been brought to Dallas at the time of the JFK assassination for some other reason under some other pretense, for example, thinking that he was part of some \"dummy\" assassination attempt to provoke a backlash against Fidel Castro. Again, we'll never know. One could spin any number of scenarios. Personally, I'm not convinced that photographs which purport to show Milteer in Dallas on November 22 actually are photographs of Milteer. Former CIA contract operative Gerry Patrick Hemming has said that he himself had almost been in attendance at the meeting where Milteer made the remarks about the impending attack on JFK and that he (Hemming) avoided the meeting because he sensed that a set - up was i n the works; Hemming has speculated that he believes that he (Hemming) was also being set up as a possible \"patsy.\" So this is real food for thought. Regarding the Minutemen and Guy Banister: it's now common knowledge that the Minute Men had been infiltrat ed by government intelligence agents for years and there is a large body of suspicion that even the founder of the Minutemen, Robert DePugh, may have been a government agent of some sort. As I note in Appendix Two of Final Judgment, one long - time governmen t informant in the Minutemen and other \"right wing\" groups was Roy Frankhauser who himself claims to have come in contact with Oswald when he (Frankhauser) was infiltrating a left wing group that Oswald was purportedly associating with. And it will be reme mbered that Dan Burros, the former American Nazi Party officer, died mysteriously in Frankhauser's home in Pennsylvania. Although Burros' name appeared in Oswald's address book, not one single JFK assassination researcher has delved into this unusual possi ble connection between Oswald and a long - time undercover informant for the federal intelligence agencies. As I've pointed out, there may be a reason for this: in at least one instance which has been documented, Frankhauser's undercover activities for the g overnment were actually being financed by a Jewish organization,"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"[546] Final Judgment 642 and it seems likely that many of his other efforts were as well. Obviously, many JFK assassination researchers tread lightly when it comes to the matter of tip - toeing around a possible tie - in between groups such as the Anti - Defamation League and those in Oswald's circle of associates. So the bottom line is that if indeed there was some \"right wing\" connection to the JFK assassination it is always a very distinct possibility that these right wingers were actually \"patsies\" being manipulated by the Mossad's ADL network which has very definitely had a hand in manipulating the right wing in America. So if there were \"right wingers\" involved in some way in the assassination conspiracy, it is entir ely conceivable that they were, in some way, under the discipline of the Mossad and its ADL. And that, of course, scares the Hell out of some JFK assassination researchers. What about the allegations that \"right wing\" Texas billionaire H. L. Hunt may have been one of those involved in the assassination conspiracy? Despite the most determined efforts of a handful of promoters of the theory there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that H. L. Hunt had anything to do with the JFK assassination conspiracy, n or is there any evidence that Hunt put up any money to help further the conspiracy. He, like many others, was a critic of JFK but Hunt is simply a convenient bogeyman. Those who point to the \"Texas oil barons\" such as Hunt as being behind the JFK conspirac y fail to point out that even with Hunt there is a very significant Israeli connection to Hunt which is analyzed in some detail in Appendix Two of Final Judgment. It is entirely conceivable that H. L. Hunt did put up money for pay - offs that were involved i n some aspect of the JFK assassination and didn't himself know what the real purpose of the money was for. He may have even been deliberately and unwittingly dragged into the conspiracy in that fashion precisely for the reason that it would give the real c onspirators an edge over Hunt who was influential in Dallas and who could be relied upon to help in the cover - up or use his influence to assist in the cover - up if necessary. Hunt may have been told that the money was being used to advance \"the patriotic mo vement.\" The bottom line is that if H. L. Hunt was involved in any aspect of the JFK assassination — knowingly or not — the fact is that there is a very strong Israeli connection to the Hunt empire in the very realm — nuclear development — that was so critical a f actor in the conflict between JFK and Israel. JFK researchers who wish to blame Hunt for involvement in the conspiracy would be wise to look at this Israeli Connection, although I don't frankly think that they will. Again, it's \"too controversial.\" Isn't there now solid proof that Lyndon Johnson was actually behind the assassination of President Kennedy?"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"643 Questions & Answers [547] LBJ was the most immediate beneficiary of JFK's murder. Whether he knew it was going to take place or actually played a part in setting up the assassina tion is another matter altogether. The fact he was the beneficiary of the assassination, however, is not enough evidence to convict him. Craig Zirbel's book The Texas Connection that pinned the JFK assassination solely on LBJ was off base. LBJ was not the mastermind of the JFK assassination. Barr McClellan's 2003 book, Blood, Money & Power, has received far more attention that Zirbel's. McClellan's book is no more than an extended (and poorly written and occasionally indecipherable) hodgepodge of LBJ's Texa s antics with a highly speculative — that's putting it lightly — scenario involving a plot to kill JFK entirely Texas - based. The author never once suggests that the CIA had any hand in the affair and even claims Oswald was one of the assassins — essentially an a ffirmation of the Warren Report! While it's possible one of LBJ's old Texas cronies, Mac Wallace was indeed drafted into the conspiracy and was in the Texas School Book Depository — as McClellan claims to have evidence to prove — that doesn't prove the entiret y of McClellan's \"theory\": that LBJ's attorney Ed Clark, crafted the JFK conspiracy. In truth, the Mossad and the CIA would have been smart to implicate one of Johnson's Texas hands in the assassination including either Wallace or Clark in order to ensure a cover - up by LBJ after the fact. But I seem to be the only McClellan critic who has bothered to mention that possibility. McClellan even creates alleged conversations — in extensive detail — between LBJ and the conspirators, said conversations designed to \"pr ove\" his theory. Littered with amazing qualifiers, noting that conversations and events \"undoubtedly\" or \"almost certainly\" took place, the book is pretty bad, despite all the friendly publicity it has received in the \"mainstream\" media. Evidently the cont rollers of the media have concluded that \"the lowest common denominator\" — the idea a vice - president would be behind the killing of a president — is the one theory that satisfies everybody. One more point, the author (McClellan) just happens to be the father o f the press secretary for President George W. Bush, son of the former president (and CIA director) George H. W. Bush. Could that perhaps explain why McClellan's book doesn't have anything to say about all of the known and thoroughly documented CIA intrigue involving Oswald? Or am I just being one of those \"conspiracy theorists\" by raising the question? Final Judgment seems to hinge largely on the fact that Clay Shaw, prosecuted by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison for involvement in the JFK assass ination, had ties to the Mossad through the Permindex company. What if Shaw actually had nothing to do with the conspiracy? Doesn't that mean your whole thesis is off base? Not at all. In fact, Final Judgment could stand entirely on its own with the thesi s intact even if Clay Shaw had never lived. There are so many multiple connections to the Mossad through so many others who were"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"[548] Final Judgmen t 644 involved in the conspiracy such that Clay Shaw is only a peripheral character in the long run. And I don't believe that the b ook does hinge on the Shaw connection, although it is certainly significant. Because of the fact that Garrison was potentially going to unearth the Israeli connection (through Shaw) it was necessary that Garrison's inquiry be quashed. I noted earlier that the actual attempts to stop Garrison actually began before he had even come across Shaw. The man who actually tried to bribe Garrison into stopping the investigation, international oilman John King, was intimately tied to the Mossad and the Permindex netwo rk. The Permindex Connection is important, though, but I don't pretend to know precisely what role Shaw actually played in the conspiracy. It may well be that Shaw never knew that the assassination was in the works and that his connections to his fellow CI A asset, Guy Banister, and to Lee Harvey Oswald may, to Shaw, have appeared entirely innocent (to the extent, of course, that any intelligence intrigue of any nature can be described as \"innocent\"). The whole Garrison investigation was flawed in many ways, of course, and perhaps that is even partly Garrison's own fault. However, it's very clear that Garrison was a man with a mission and he may have gone astray in some of his assumptions and allegations. But it's clear that he hit pay dirt with the Shaw inve stigation. Shaw knew CIA contract operative David Ferrie and lied on the stand during the trial, claiming that he didn't know Ferrie. Some have come to Shaw's defense, saying he may have lied because he didn't want to be associated with a known and rather flamboyant homosexual such as Ferrie (Shaw was himself homosexual) but this is a limp - wristed excuse, no pun intended. But more importantly, Shaw did have a long - time association with the CIA as we know now, but Garrison was never able to prove that connec tion at the time. If he had, it's likely that Shaw may have been convicted. However, the jury concluded that there wasn't enough evidence to tie Shaw to any conspiracy. Don't forget that one of Garrison's key witnesses, a New Orleans police officer named A loysius Habighorst was never permitted to testify to the fact that Shaw had admitted to the officer that he sometimes used the alias \"Clay Bertrand.\" This was significant in that it was a \"Clay Bertrand\" who had called New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews and asked Andrews to represent Oswald after he was arrested in Dallas. Andrews said that he had dealt with \"Clay Bertrand\" in the past so when he received the call after the assassination, the name of Clay Bertrand was not unfamiliar. And it is apparent that Shaw was indeed \"Clay Betrand.\" Had the jury heard the testimony by the police officer, of course, it would have probably sealed Shaw's fate during the trial in New Orleans. So I believe very firmly that the thesis in Final Judgment would stand without or without the matter of the Clay Shaw investigation. The Shaw investigation, I suppose, might be the icing on a very big cake, so to speak. Frankly, I think a good case can be made that Shaw — despite his long time ties to the CIA — may also well have been some sort of contract"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"645 Questions & Answers [549] operative for the Mossad. I realize that's going out on a limb, but I have never completely discounted this. While writing Final Judgment I pondered this at length. After all, Shaw was not exactly a household name in America yet here he was selected to serve on the board of the Mossad - dominated Permindex company based in Europe. How was it that Shaw — of all people — was brought on board? Here's the question: was Shaw more \"CIA\" than \"Mossad\" or vice - versa or was he wearing several hats? G. Robert Blakey, the former director of the House Assassinations Committee, and David Scheim, author of Contract on America, both say that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" and suggest that New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello was the mastermind of the assassination. Isn't it entirely possible that it was Marcello who was the prime mover behind the crime and that he didn't have any Mossad or CIA assistance and that such CIA assets as Guy Banister and David Ferrie and Clay Shaw just happened to be in Marcello's sphere of influence in New Orleans? This is not likely at all. Marcello, of course, was an Organized Crime protégé and underling of Meyer Lansky and existed as Mafia boss of New Orleans precisely because Lansky put him there. It's a simple fact that both Blakey and Scheim never mention. Even Marcello's biographer, John Davis, writing in Mafia Kingfish points this out (although Davis himself contends that Marcellos was the JFK assassination mastermind). Although Marcello, on his own, was one of the most powerful \" Mafia bosses\" in the country, he owed his status to Lansky's patronage, and Marcello's rackets in New Orleans and extending apparently into Texas were among some of the most lucrative in the Lansky syndicate. So Marcello would not have single - handedly orch estrated the murder of the President of the United States without the approval of Meyer Lansky. Lansky, of course, was tied closely with the Mossad and the CIA (and we should not fail to mention that Marcello himself was tied, at the very least, with the C IA in that he was helping finance the CIA's war against Castro, including, of course Guy Banister's operations in New Orleans.) And considering the documented fact that Marcellos' own international business connections were quite far flung on their own, it 's inevitable (considering his ties to Lansky) that he would have actually had Mossad connections of his own. But Carlos Marcello was not the mastermind and prime mover behind the JFK assassination. Marcello is a colorful figure and an easy target for stud ents of the JFK assassination conspiracy, but despite the fact that Marcello was a very powerful figure on his own, the conspiracy was far too broad - ranging (let alone the cover - up) for it to have simply been a product of the Marcello organization. The the ory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\" is enticing, but factually way off the mark. I have to add — and call it \"anti - Semitic\" if you will — that my real belief is that because David Scheim, the author of Contract On"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"[550] Final Judgment 646 America, is Jewish that he is so eager to downpl ay Meyer Lansky's influence on Organized Crime (which is what Scheim does in his book blaming Marcello for the JFK assassination). Over the years there has been a great concern in the Jewish community about representations about Jewish influence (I would s ay predominance) in Organized Crime, but one cannot seriously look at the role of Marcello in the assassination without acknowledging that he was a protégé of Lansky. I can understand Scheim's concerns about stirring up anti - Semitism by revealing Lansky's preeminent role in Organized Crime, but if he is a serious researcher as he purports to be he would be willing to face the facts and not shade them as he does. Was Jack Ruby a CIA contract operative or an FBI informant? Just what role did he play in the p lanning of the assassination of JFK if he played any role at all? There's no doubt in my mind that Ruby did know Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination. If he didn't actually know him personally, he knew of him. However, there are too many stories o f likely personal connections between the two to discount that the two knew one another and were working together in some form of intrigue. There are convincing stories that Ruby had some contacts with the CIA through his activities in running guns to both Fidel Castro (prior to Castro's seizure of power) and, later, to the anti - Castro exiles. Former CIA contract operative Marita Lorenz, of course, has testified that Ruby showed up the day before the assassination at the motel in Dallas where she and Mossad - connected CIA man Frank Sturgis and a group of Cuban exiles were staying. Her story is just one of many of many that tie Ruby in some form or another not only to the CIA, but in events leading up to the assassination. Ruby, of course, was not \"Mafia.\" Rub y was Jewish. Let's lay it on the line. The presence of Jack Ruby in the JFK assassination scenario does not point to \"The Mafia.\" In Final Judgment I discuss this in detail. Ruby was instead a part of the Lansky/Jewish element in the crime syndicate. Ther e are, of course, many people who are afraid to get into this area because they are afraid of being called \"anti - Semitic.\" Another thing to bear in mind: those such as David Scheim and Robert Blakey who claim that \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" point to the fact that just prior to the JFK assassination Ruby was in contact with many organized crime - linked individuals and they say that this proves that Ruby was trafficking with \"the Mafia.\" The big problem here is that these so - called \"Mafia\" figures that Ruby was i n touch with were largely Jewish. So if I may resort to ethnic terminology here: whatever Ruby was talking with these people about, it was more likely about bagels than about pasta. In Final Judgment I have firmly pinpointed a Ruby connection to Israel and the Mossad through attorney Luis Kutner (Ruby's long - time friend from Chicago) and I have also outlined other previously ignored Ruby connections to arms smuggling to Israel and Ruby's involvement with so -"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"647 Questions & Answers [551] called \"reporters\" from Israeli newspapers in D allas. The Israeli connections are there for those who wish to find them — and for those who don't. As far as Ruby's killing of Oswald, it appears to me that it was something that Ruby \"had\" to do — something he was ordered to do. He no doubt thought that he w ould eventually walk away a free man. In Final Judgment you actually suggest that Jack Ruby did not actually die when he is reported to have died and that he actually later went to Israel. This story seems outlandish and puts the overall credibility of th e book in doubt. I do not say that this is true. I simply cite a source who told that story. The story was told by a woman who knew Jack Ruby and worked with him many years ago in San Francisco. The woman who told the story, Grace Pratt, by all accounts w as a reliable woman not known to making up such stories and she was so afraid of what she thought she knew — that Ruby was still alive — that she asked that the story never be repeated while she was alive. I was frankly hesitant to publish this story, recogniz ing how sensational the story is, and I went back and forth before biting the bullet and deciding to put the story in the book. I felt that, for the record, Mrs. Pratt's story should be told since it definitely brought in yet another possible Israeli conne ction that brought the thesis of Final Judgment full circle. The very fact that the story has never been reported anywhere else — despite many other bizarre JFK assassination legends that have been given widespread circulation — actually gives Mrs. Pratt's sto ry a certain credence. Bear in mind that if Ruby did not die when he purportedly died — and if I am entirely wrong and Israel had nothing to do with the JFK assassination — it is entirely possible that Jack Ruby was secreted out of the United States if only fo r humanitarian reasons. There may have been Jews in the United States and Israel who were sympathetic to Ruby and said that he had committed a \"patriotic\" act — killing the president's assassin — and that he should be given the opportunity to start a new life. This is completely logical. There have been many who have asked that convicted American Jewish traitor Jonathan Pollard, who spied for Israel, be released from prison and allowed to take up life in Israel. Why shouldn't the same have been possible for Rub y? The idea is not that sensational. What's more, the argument could be made that announcing Ruby's death and allowing him to leave the country would have been justified on the basis that it would \"spare the country of the turmoil of another trial.\" And Ru by was indeed scheduled to go on trial once again. I do know that Grace Pratt did believe that she saw Jack Ruby photographed boarding a plane for Israel and I do know that she never told the story publicly or sought recognition. No, she was scared. So I d on't discount the story. Now it's very interesting, by the way, that after Final Judgment was published, Beverly Oliver published a book, Nightmare in Dallas, in which"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"[552] Final Judgment 648 she states flatly that some years ago she was in contact with a person she believes wa s actually Jack Ruby. Her story is that \"Ruby\" claimed to have been subjected to surgical masking and some form of hypnosis and she presents this story as though she gives it credibility. Now this story sounds as possibly outlandish as Grace Pratt's story to some people, but I don't discount this possibility, nor do I think it actually conflicts with Mrs. Pratt's story in any way. Both things could have happened: Ruby could have gone to Israel and he could have undergone plastic surgery. With all of the sto ries we hear about the Federal Witness Protection Program, why can't we consider the possibility that something \"unusual\" did take place at the time of Ruby's reported death? So there is another story out there circulating that suggests there was more to R uby's death than meets the eye. I would strongly urge some JFK assassination researcher to tackle this controversy and get to the bottom of it. I don't intend to do it myself. In any case I will conclude by pointing out that whether Jack Ruby died at the t ime he is supposed to have died — or not — is immaterial to the thesis of Final Judgment. Anyone who seeks to discredit Final Judgment by citing the Grace Pratt story and suggesting that it reflects the tone or the overall thesis of the book is being dishonest . What do you see as the biggest flaw in the widely - promoted theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK\"? Anybody could have actually killed JFK, even including as the Warren Commission claimed, one lone nut. The big question in the assassination conspiracy is: w ho had the power to cover up the conspiracy? The Mafia didn't have that power, despite its wide - ranging connections nationally and internationally. And it was not the Mafia that convened the Warren Commission and dictated its actions from top to bottom. Th ere is no question that there were definite repeated links to the Mafia throughout the JFK assassination conspiracy, even including among those who had ties to the CIA. But the Mafia did not have the power to be manipulating the CIA's strange activities in Mexico City that were designed to link Lee Harvey Oswald to a purported Soviet KGB assassinations expert. In the pages of Final Judgment, I think, I firmly demolish any suggestion that the Mafia was ultimately responsible for the JFK assassination. Now wi th the revelation that Mossad - connected Hyman Lamer was the real \"boss\" of Sam Giancana, the famed \"Mafia\" chief in Chicago, the old legend that \"the Mafia Killed JFK\" finds itself entangled with a very significant Mossad connection that casts new light on the secret history of organized crime. Did FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover have any part in the planning of the JFK assassination? Did Hoover know that JFK was slated for assassination? Was Hoover involved in the cover - up? In Final Judgment you never precis ely answer these questions."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"649 Questions & Answers [553] I would be inclined to think that Hoover probably had advance knowledge that there was a plot or plots against JFK — perhaps even the one that ultimately succeeded — if only because of his wide - ranging intelligence network that ha d connections to the very conspirators who were intimately involved in the actual planning of the assassination. I would add that he probably allowed the assassination to take place and did nothing to interfere with the conspiracy's progress. It wouldn't h ave been in Hoover's interests to stop the assassination. I find it highly unlikely that Hoover had any part in planning the assassination and no one has ever been able to find any evidence that he did. Hoover's actual participation was not, of course, cri tical to actually carrying out the deed. Frankly, it would have been better (from the standpoint of the conspirators) that Hoover not have any advance knowledge or actually be given any such knowledge. That would have only given Hoover more leverage and th e less people who were in the know, the better. I've heard that Hoover was supposedly at a party in Dallas at the ranch of his good friend Clint Murchison, the Texas oil baron, the night before the assassination, reveling in the company of LBJ and even rep ortedly Richard Nixon but this appears to me to be just another one of those exciting rumors that take on a life of their own. People love stories such as this, but even if Hoover was in Dallas that day before the assassination (and I've never really seen it confirmed that he was, and frankly I doubt it), it doesn't mean he had anything to do with the assassination. The question of whether Hoover was involved in the cover - up is another story, inasmuch as it was the FBI that was providing information to the Warren Commission's investigation. So in that sense Hoover was involved in the cover - up. Hoover is an outstanding villain but his sole crime vis - à - vis the JFK assassination, I suppose, is that he was J. Edgar Hoover. What about Richard Nixon and George Bu sh? Do you think that either of them had anything at all to do with any aspect of the assassination conspiracy? There have been stories about this floating around for years. Richard Nixon has become another bogeyman among JFK assassination theorists, but there's no more evidence to link Nixon to the assassination any more than there is any evidence to link Hoover. It's an exciting theory, but that's all it is and let's keep that in mind. George Bush's name is also linked time and again to the assassination and in Final Judgment I explored this in some detail, but again, it seems highly unlikely that Bush was part of any assassination planning, but apparently as part of his work for the CIA — although he denies he was working for the CIA in 1963 — Bush did have ties to the anti - Castro Cuban exiles and it's likely that Bush, at one time or another, may have crossed paths with people who may have had some direct hand in manipulating a portion of the overall conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"[554] Final Judgment 650 George Bush could probably be indicted and c onvicted for any number of crimes, but conspiracy in the JFK assassination is not likely one of them. The full story of George Bush and his record of CIA intrigue has yet to be told — and, unfortunately, will probably never be told — but I felt that, for the r ecord, it would be appropriate to explore Bush's possible ties to the assassination in the pages of Final Judgment. And just for the record, I'd like to throw out my own little theory about Bush's connection to the JFK affair. This is sure to be controvers ial and I don't have any evidence to prove it, but I'll put it on the table for others to think about. Although most JFK assassination researchers are convinced that the mysterious CIA figure \"Maurice Bishop\" (once purportedly seen in Texas in the company of Lee Harvey Oswald) was actually longtime CIA figure David Atlee Phillips, I have personally always felt that the famous sketch of \"Bishop\" which many say has a strong resemblance to Phillips, could just as easily be George Bush. And if you compare photo s of Bush and Phillips, it's conceivable that some might find the two to have a similar appearance. Is it at all possible that \"Maurice Bishop\" was really a George Bush CIA code name during Bush's CIA intrigue with the Cubans around the time of the JFK ass assination? Is it possible that the code name \"Maurice Bishop\" was actually used by several people, Bush being among them? Is it possible that since David Atlee Phillips was known as a CIA figure that the CIA floated the story that Phillips was really \"Bis hop\" so as to keep Bush's CIA connection deep cover? As I say, this is all pure speculation and I'm not suggesting that there's any evidence to prove it. However . . . Long before the publication of Mark Lane's book, Plausible Denial (not to mention the story in The Spotlight that sparked the libel suit by former CIA man E. Howard Hunt that is described in Lane's book), there was a lot of speculation that Hunt was involved in the JFK assassination and that he may have been one of the famous \"tramps\" phot ographed in Dealey Plaza shortly after the president's murder. Do you think Hunt was one of those tramps or that those \"tramps\" were involved in the assassination conspiracy? First of all, I am very familiar with all of the research and writing regarding the so - called \"tramps.\" However, I am not convinced that E. Howard Hunt was one of those tramps. I have even seen another picture, published in one of the tabloids, that purports to show Hunt picking up a bullet in Dealey Plaza immediately after the assass ination. (If anything the individual which is supposed to be Hunt looks more like former President Gerald Ford who served on the Warren Commission and I don't think that it was Ford.) Hunt is a suspicious character and he was mixed up in the intrigue surro unding the assassination as Plausible Denial and Final Judgment together prove. The book Coup d'Etat in America by A. J. Weberman and Michael Canfield alleges that Hunt was one of the tramps, but, as I say, I don't believe it."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"651 Questions & Answers [555] Now there's new information released by the Dallas police in recent years that shows that there were some tramps picked up in Dealey Plaza and they've been firmly identified as tramps — not as assassins or conspirators. However, there are still some JFK assassination researchers who a re quibbling about that and say that the full story has yet to be told. One of the more recent stories that's came out is the story told by Chauncey Holt who claims that it was he who was the \"tramp\" that everybody says is E. Howard Hunt and it turns out t hat Holt is not one of the tramps whose names appear in the Dallas police records. So there are a lot of JFK researchers who don't believe Holt's story — and then, again, there are those who do. If these men were somehow involved in the assassination, it's n ot likely they were the actual triggermen. JFK assassination researcher Robert Groden has published enhanced photographs of what is likely a gunman firing from the grassy knoll and this assassin seems to be wearing a policeman's uniform. He is most definit ely not one of these tramps. I really don't think the so - called tramps are of any real consequence in the end, but it's a nice diversion. The men who were photographed in Dealey Plaza probably were just what they appeared to be. It would be nice to resolve the matter just to make everybody happy. What role did E. Howard Hunt did play in the JFK conspiracy? This is a very interesting question and the answer itself is complex. I addressed this subject in Chapter 16 of Final Judgment but I'd like to comment further here. We don't know precisely where Hunt was at the time of the JFK assassination. This is something that was never firmly established even during the Hunt libel trial and Hunt's answers, while under sharp cross - examination by Mark Lane were inconc lusive at best. Hunt insisted that he was in the Washington, D.C. area (whether at home in the suburbs or at the office or downtown shopping at one or more points during the day) on November 22, the day of the assassination. However, he never did address t he allegation made under oath during the second trial by his former CIA associate, contract operative Marita Lorenz, that she and CIA operative Frank Sturgis and a group of Cuban exiles met up with Hunt in Dallas on November 21 — the day before the assassina tion. (And this, of course, would have given Hunt time to return to Washington to be in the capital city area on the actual day of the assassination). What's more, as we noted earlier, Miss Lorenz said that Jack Ruby, who killed Lee Harvey Oswald several d ays later, also visited them at that motel. So there is no question but that there was some intrigue involving Hunt in Dallas tying him to intrigue involving CIA - connected individuals that were linked in some way to the assassination conspiracy. I'm not su ggesting — and neither has Mark Lane, for that matter — that Hunt fired a gun at John F. Kennedy or even in his general direction on November 22. I do believe that Hunt was in Dallas at least just prior to the assassination. What he was doing there is the inte resting story about which we know so very little."},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"[556] Final Judgment 652 As we saw in Chapter 16, it was clearly James Angleton at the CIA who was responsible for leaking the internal CIA memo that placed Hunt in Dallas at the time of the assassination, laying the grist for th e story that ultimately resulted in Hunt's libel suit against The Spotlight. In the opinion of investigative reporter Joe Trento (who, by the way, is a sworn enemy of The Spotlight newspaper, once having been forced to settle a libel suit against him by Th e Spotlight's publisher, Willis Carto) it is likely not only that Hunt was indeed in Dallas and that it was Angleton who sent him there. However, Hunt isn't admitting to anything. It appears to me that Hunt was functioning as a facilitator, so to speak, in the JFK assassination conspiracy, engaged in Dallas (and in New Orleans) with some of the other people who were circling around Lee Harvey Oswald. It's very conceivable that Hunt had no idea that his mission in Dallas involved an actual assassination plot — perhaps he was only involved in a \"dummy\" assassination plot that was manipulated and overtaken by outside forces and turned into the real thing — and I explored this possibility in Chapter 16. Consider this: Although Hunt met up with Miss Lorenz and Frank Sturgis and money passed from Hunt to Sturgis, this doesn't necessarily indicate that — even though Sturgis himself later told Lorenz that his team had been involved in killing the president — that Hunt knew an actual assassination was in the offing. He may ha ve known — but not necessarily. However, he put himself in the position where, after the fact, he looked guilty as Hell, considering the later testimony by Lorenz. However, we must consider the fact that — whatever happened in Dallas — Hunt nonetheless later onc e again teamed up with Frank Sturgis during the Watergate fiasco that led to the \"assassination\" of another president, and in Watergate, too, as we have seen, there was a distinct Israeli connection, also involving Angleton. Crank into that the fact — as we now know — that Frank Sturgis was not only a CIA asset, but had also long been involved in Mossad intrigue, and we find a very interesting set of wheels within wheels, so to speak. But Hunt was — and is — a loyal CIA man and he's not admitting to anything one wa y or another. And when Hunt needed a witness from the CIA in his libel trial, it was Angleton's long - time deputy, Newton \"Scotty\" Miler, who came to Hunt's rescue. I don't think this is any surprise. So although it appears that in 1978 the CIA was initiall y planning to throw Hunt to the wolves and frame him for involvement in the assassination — painted as a \"rogue\" operative — by his former CIA superiors, by the time his libel trial against The Spotlight came to pass that he and the CIA reached an accord and t hey provided him assistance. It appears that precisely because The Spotlight article unveiled the intended \"limited hangout\" aimed against Hunt that the operation was shelved. Recall that a \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter, ostensibly from Lee Harvey Oswald, popped up at the time that this \"limited hangout\" operation was in its opening stages as the House Assassinations Committee was beginning its inquiry. I believe that this was another Angleton dirty trick, although a new"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"653 Questions & Answers [557] book by a CIA - connected author claims thi s was a KGB scheme. In the \"Final Word?\" section of Final Judgment, I'll be addressing that in some detail further. All in all, if there's anybody who's alive today who knows what really happened in Dallas, it's undoubtedly Hunt. However, if Hunt should ev er find the need or a reason to \"go public\" with \"what he knows,\" I do believe we might want to take what he says with a grain of salt. Hunt is a very skilled spy novelist and a prolific one at that, and if some publisher offered him a few million dollars to \"tell all,\" it's conceivable that Hunt — in collaboration with the CIA, or maybe just on his own — will come up with some fantastic story that will satisfy the public craving and that he will, thus, set himself — and his story — as the final judgment as to what happened in Dallas. And that could result in the truth being buried forever. I'm afraid too many people will be ready to believe anything Hunt says simply because he is who he is. So let's be careful about believing what Hunt might say. I will make this p rediction, though: if Hunt does come forth with some \"final solution\" to the mystery that it will come down to a story that the assassination was a KGB conspiracy — with Castro connections — and that some \"rogue\" CIA operatives somehow got caught in the middle . This could be the final linchpin for a last - ditch attack on Castro and since the Soviet Union has gone out of business, it won't really matter very much whether Hunt blames them or not. Isn't Jim Marrs' book, CrossFire, the book that even more so than F inal Judgment pulls together all of the JFK theories and allows the reader to make a final judgment for himself? Crossfire is a wonderful book and provides a comprehensive overview of all of the JFK assassination lore that was available at the time it wen t to press. I am hopeful that if Marrs re - issues Crossfire in an up - dated edition that he will mention the theory that appears in Final Judgment, if only to try to tear it apart. But I don't think he can. If he is capable of so doing, I hope that he will a ttempt to do it in a responsible fashion. All in all, I don't think that Marrs comes to any real conclusions one way or another. He hints that perhaps LBJ may have been responsible for the assassination and he also points a finger at the \"military - industri al complex\" but that's about it. I would suggest that people read Crossfire before they even read Final Judgment because it is an outstanding compendium of the basic theories and findings regarding the assassination and once you understand the gist of thos e theories you will see how Final Judgment does indeed tie them together in a relatively simple theory that does make ultimate sense. Many people have told me that they had read virtually all of the other books on the assassination but that mine was the on e that truly did tie it all together and which provided the most comprehensive explanation of what really happened."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"[558] Final Judgment 654 How does the thesis presented in Final Judgment conflict with the theory presented in a number of works that suggest that it was some sort of CIA - Mafia conspiracy that resulted in the JFK assassination? I don't believe that the theory presented in Final Judgment essentially conflicts with the basic thesis that it was a combination of CIA and Mafia elements who were behind the president's mu rder. On the contrary, the basic thesis there fits neatly into the scenario presented in Final Judgment. My book, however, draws in the Israeli Connection that no one has ever addressed before and explains that the so - called \"French Connection\" that others have sought to show was somehow evidence of CIA or even \"Mafia\" involvement points more distinctly to the Israeli Connection. It's very clear to me that the other theorists don't frankly understand the meaning of the French Connection — that it is the Israe li Connection. The French Connection additionally, of course, relates directly to both the CIA and the Mafia and even directly to the office of CIA contract operative Guy Banister in New Orleans. So Final Judgment is quite unique in that it explains how al l of these seemingly diverse elements are tied together by the Israeli Connection. Anyone who has read any book suggesting that it was some sort of CIA - Mafia conspiracy and accepts that thesis can now read Final Judgment and realize that there is nothing i n Final Judgment that conflicts with that basic thesis. I would add that Final Judgment is also instructive in that it presents a more accurate view of the reality of the true nature of the Organized Crime Syndicate and the primary role that Meyer Lansky p layed in the underworld. Final Judgment, in that sense, is the first book ever to explore Lansky's connection to the crime of the century. I firmly believe that Final Judgment presents an argument that no one who believes in the basic \"CIA - Mafia\" conspirac y can reject out of hand. Those who do reject it, I tend to suspect, are those who are afraid of the big picture. The book shows that Israel had not only the means and the motive, but also the opportunity — all of the components a good lawyer will need to wi n a successful murder conviction. One reader, in fact, suggested that Final Judgment read like nothing less than a legal indictment. And an indictment it certainly is. Could you give an overview of what you view as the basic structure of the JFK assassina tion conspiracy? Doesn't the immense international conspiracy portrayed in Final Judgment necessarily involve such a large number of people that it would have been impossible to keep such a conspiracy secret for all of these years? Well, first of all the conspiracy is no longer a secret. I wrote about it in Final Judgment. And I don't mean that answer facetiously. After all, thanks to my French source I was able to pin down the secret roles of Israeli Mossad figure Yitzhak Shamir and French SDECE officer Georges deLannurien in the conspiracy. So somebody somewhere with some \"inside\""},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"655 Questions & A nswers [559] knowledge did talk and that's how the information about these two conspirators fell into my lap as I was writing Final Judgment. The question is well taken, however. But what I've said many, many times in answer to inquiries is that what I believe is unique — among many things, I suppose — about Final Judgment is that it does present a conspiracy that actually only involves a small number of people. That is, only a handful of peop le involved would have actually known that the president was going to be killed. All of the other people who somehow were brought into the conspiracy would not have even known the parts that they were playing in furthering such a conspiracy. That, I think, is one important aspect of the theory that I present in Final Judgment. The number of those involved in the conspiracy who actually knew that JFK was going to be assassinated was probably very limited indeed — yet those who were \"in the know\" had vast resou rces at their command to influence substantially larger numbers of people who would never necessarily know that they were indeed participating in an assassination conspiracy aimed at President Kennedy. As I see it there were some six stages involved in the actual assassination: 1) the initiation of the conspiracy: who set it in motion? 2) the planning and coordination: the hiring of the assassins, for example; 3) the f i n a n c i n g — w h o p u t u p t h e m o n e y t o c a r r y i t o u t ? 4 ) t h e facilitation — setting up the patsy, m aking sure everything was in place on November 22; 5) the execution of the assassination; and 6) the cover - up. As far as the the actual initiation of the conspiracy, as I've said, it appears evident that this took place through interaction between the Isra eli Mossad and the top levels of the CIA as a consequence of their own reaction to JFK's policies. Not to mention, of course, CIA and Mossad interaction with other power groups that were under the gun during the Kennedy administration — most notably, organiz ed crime. I've already squarely placed the blame for initiating the conspiracy on James Angleton of the CIA and Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion but there were others who may have been on \"the inside\" as well. Once it was decided that JFK would be \" hit\" it was necessary for the second stage of the conspiracy: the planning and coordination. Someone had to be responsible for recruiting the assassins, for laying the overall groundwork, determining where the assassination would take place and how it woul d be financed. This, I tend to believe, was probably carried out by Yitzhak Shamir who was head of the Mossad's assassinations team. He, of course, would have worked closely with Angleton and we do know that he contracted out at least one assassin or team of assassins through his ally in French intelligence, Colonel Georges deLannurien. The financing for all of this could have come from a wide variety of sources. Although, of course, both the CIA and the Mossad have immense budgets at their disposal (includ ing the CIA's famed \"black budget\") not to mention a wide variety of front companies, known as proprietaries, it does seem likely that the money used to finance the operation was carefully"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"[560] Final Judgment 656 laundered and perhaps even came from sources outside the CIA and the Mossad to ensure that the money could never be traced. An easily accessible source of quick, big, untraceable cash would certainly be the CIA and Mossad allies in the Lansky Crime Syndicate. Lansky himself, not to mention his mob associates, along with the Mossad's Permindex front, all kept bank accounts at Rabbi Tibor Rosenbaum's Banque de Credit Internationale in Geneva. It's possible that Rosenbaum transferred money through Permindex board member Clay Shaw who in turn was a paymaster of sorts in New Orleans, handing out money to Guy Banister and even Lee Harvey Oswald who was being set up as the patsy through Banister's office. And then, again, if Banister's operation involving Oswald had actually been set up and coordinated by the New Orleans office of the ADL, which does seem likely, the money for Oswald's paycheck from Banister might literally have been subsidized directly (or indirectly) from the ADL. And it has been revealed in official court documents that the ADL actually uses middle - men to pay their \"fact finders,\" such as Banister and company, to disguise the source of the funds. So this illustrates how a wide variety of seemingly separate entities could have been used to finance the operation with no trace back directly to the CIA or the Mossa d. Although the ADL, for example, does report to the Mossad, it is unlikely that any Mossad money, per se, has even been transferred into the ADL's bank account. Funds for some or another part of the assassination set - up could have come from other sources. There have been stories that Jack Ruby visited the office of Texas oil baron H. L. Hunt shortly before the assassination. Perhaps Hunt did put up money that was used by Ruby in whatever function Ruby was carrying out prior to the assassination. Hunt may h ave been assured that the money was for an \"anti - communist\" demonstration the day of the assassination. Ruby may have even told Hunt that a group of anti - Castro Cubans, disguised as pro - Castro Cubans, were going to stage some sort of \"incident\" to discredi t Castro while JFK was in Dallas. Ruby himself might have believed that was the project underway! (My own guess is that Ruby was setting up the \"second Oswald\" or \"Oswalds\" as the case may be. That is, Ruby was arranging \"incidents\" around Dallas to make i t appear as though the real Lee Harvey Oswald was a \"pro - Castro agitator\" and gun - toting extremist.) Now all of this is pure speculation, of course, but I don't think it's far off the mark. I'm trying to frame it in a perspective that makes sense. We've ta lked about initiation and we've talked about planning and coordination and about financing. The fourth level in the assassination conspiracy would be \"facilitation.\" That would specifically be those areas such as the activities in New Orleans and Dallas wh ere Lee Harvey Oswald was being set up and/or was inadvertently setting himself up as the case may be. We have Clay Shaw, Guy Banister, David Ferrie and Jack Ruby operating at this level, although Shaw himself may never have even had"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"657 Questions & Answers [561] direct contact with the real Lee Harvey Oswald. There were also, of course, anti - Castro Cuban exiles being utilized at this level. It's also likely, as I've pointed out, that a number of potential patsies were being set up in various cities around the country. The facilitator s, in these cities, would have no idea that they were being utilized in an assassination plot setting up the patsy. There were probably several people around the country with profiles similar to that of Lee Harvey Oswald who were being set up in the event the assassination would have to be carried out in their particular city: Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, Billings, Montana. It seems unlikely that the conspirators were prepared to transport Lee Harvey Oswald back and forth around the country trailing JFK wai ting for the right moment to strike. No, instead, there were other \"Oswalds\" — other patsies — in place in those cities. And since the assassination did not take place in those locations the facilitators would not necessarily ever realize the real motivation b ehind the things that they had been instructed to do. For all of this, it's also entirely possible, as I've said, that there were even several other patsies being set up in Dallas or in other places in Texas. However, there were not just \"facilitators\" ope rating around Lee Harvey Oswald and at his level. There were also facilitators working around the impending victim of the assassination plot. In the circles around John F. Kennedy there were those who were reporting back, most definitely to the CIA, about what JFK's plans were, both in regard to critical high - level international matters immediately affecting the CIA and the Mossad, but also in regard to such specific matters as to where JFK was planning to visit during his trip to Texas. This would have bee n routine, of course, since the CIA has long had its operatives planted throughout the executive branch and they have co - opted (through blackmail and pay - offs) people not directly on the CIA payroll. These people reporting back to the CIA, obviously, would have no idea that they were being used to further the assassination conspiracy. Ultimately, I'm certain, it was Angleton at the CIA who was getting the \"need to know\" intelligence on JFK's activities. It was probably literally laid on Angleton's desk on a daily basis. The CIA may have even helped shape the president's plans in some way: ensuring, for example, that his motorcade took a particular route through Dallas. I use this just as a simple example of really how simple the process would be. And the per son or persons who were utilized would never necessarily know they were being manipulated, nor even in retrospect would they necessarily even realize that they had been manipulated. We might add that there was another critical element at the facilitation l evel. This was the CIA team, headed by David Atlee Phillips, head of the CIA's Western Hemisphere desk, that was responsible — the month prior to the assassination — for laying the \"evidence\" that Lee Harvey Oswald was meeting with a Soviet assassinations expe rt in Mexico City. This was another important brick in the foundation of the conspiracy — the framing of the patsy at a particularly high level."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"[562] Final Judgment 658 Without the assistance of all of these people the assassination and the cover - up could not take place. But all of their actions could have been carried out without these people even suspecting what was in the works. And in many instances their actions were routine, day - to - day tasks. Then, of course, there are the assassins themselves. These assassins may not have e ven known the location (or the identity) of the other gunmen. The assassination coordination may have been so totally compartmentalized that the operations of the various teams may have been conducted strictly on a need - to - know basis. There may have even b een other assassination teams brought to Dallas and set in place in the event that the strike in Dealey Plaza had to be called off. These teams would not necessarily know that the others were in place. Obviously, we will never know the whole story. The fac t that CIA man Frank Sturgis (also a longtime Mossad asset) later told Marita Lorenz that his team was involved in the assassination is also of interest. Sturgis never apparently claimed to have been one of the actual shooters, but Cuban intelligence, as w e have seen, has said that he was involved in arranging communications between the hit teams. The people at the facilitation level could also have been utilized in helping the actual assassins escape. Jack Ruby would have been an ideal facilitator used in manipulating members of the Dallas police force. A few hefty pay - offs here and there would do the job. Officer J. D. Tippit was probably one involved and it seems to me that Tippit was killed when he refused to do his job. And then, again, perhaps Tippit w as actually slated for execution for the purpose of pinning the crime on Oswald. The ultimate level is the level of cover - up and damage control. Many of those involved in facilitating the assassination would have a vested interest in covering up the roles of not only themselves but their associates in the conspiracy (once they realized that they had played a role in advancing the conspiracy, even unwittingly). This certainly involved people in both the CIA and the FBI, not to mention other government agenci es including even the Dallas police. Most of those involved might not even have realized that they were engaged in actions designed to cover - up the truth. We do know that James Angleton had an interesting guest in his office at Langley on the day of the as sassination. That was the Mossad's French ally, SDECE Colonel Georges deLannurien. It's obvious that they were together for hands - on, face - to - face damage control. This was a major operation and it was vital that these two key high - level conspirators be tog ether in the event anything went awry. Obviously at this critical time communication by telephone or by carrier pigeon was not ideal. In the end, of course, had it not been for the powerful corrupt (and corrupting) force of the American media — itself so hea vily influenced by the pro - Israel lobby and the CIA (both separately and together) — the cover - up would not have been so pervasive and lasted so long as it did. I truly do believe that the way the media reacted to Warren Commission critics is a telltale sign that Israel did have a hand in the assassination conspiracy. Virtually all of the major JFK assassination researchers have commented on the phenomenon of the media's collaboration in the cover -"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"659 Questions & Answers [563] up. Yet, nobody ever mentions the influence of the Israeli lobby on the American media. You can't look at the JFK assassination without seriously examining the role of the media in the cover - up. It's paramount — and it does point to the Israeli connection, whether people want to admit it or not. Why can't all of th e JFK assassination researchers team up and work together to find the solution to the mystery? Wouldn't that be more productive than working at cross - purposes? First of all, frankly, I believe that I have found the solution — and, as I've said, it incorpor ates all of the major thinking about what really happened in Dallas. I have brought in the un - mentioned Israeli Connection, but that is indeed what ties all of the other theories together. However, the fact is that because there are so many people with so many pet areas of interest and expertise they inevitably end up in conflict with one another. This is one reason why I have never directly involved myself in the ranks of the JFK assassination researchers who are continually having conferences and meetings . Essentially, I would have to say, the mystery has been solved as far as it is ever going to be solved. It's ironic but there are several JFK assassination study groups and they essentially operate, in one form or another, as \"rivals\" to one another, feud ing and bickering with each other. Another factor is that there are many people who do have particular areas of expertise: whether it be ballistics, or pathology or photography. I claim expertise in none of these areas. I do have a wide - ranging background in a number of areas but I would not tout myself as an expert in any of that subject matter. I have a good working knowledge of not only the history of the CIA and the Israeli Mossad, but also the history of Organized Crime. I am familiar with U.S. Middle East policy and of the foreign policy conflicts of the JFK administration. And in the course of writing Final Judgment I availed myself of the available published research on the French conflict over Algeria which, as I've noted, ultimately played a critic al role in the evolution of the JFK assassination conspiracy. Frankly, I would say that it's a sure bet that you will not find even another writer in the arena of the JFK assassination who has studied all of these areas as I have. That is precisely why I w as able to pull Final Judgment together in the fashion that I did. After all, honestly, how many JFK assassination researchers really have any knowledge of the history of JFK's relations with Israel? They have focused, instead, on Vietnam and on the Cuban conflict and, as a consequence, missed the big picture. I'm not criticizing them. I'm just stating a fact. I am personally willing to work with other JFK assassination researchers to the extent that I'm able but, as I've pointed out earlier, many of these \"experts\" have refused to acknowledge my work (for reasons which I suspect are obvious). I don't discount anything when it comes right down to it and I have always said that it's entirely possible — and I'm not being facetious — that if"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"[564] Final Judgment 660 someone can prove to me that the Vatican was ultimately behind the JFK assassination conspiracy, manipulating the CIA and the Mossad, for example, I might be willing to believe it. All I ask is for somebody to show me the evidence. It's as simple as that. And if I'm wrong, I w ant people to show me where I'm wrong. That's not too much to ask. It would be ideal if everybody could work together, but it will never happen. There's a lot of politics involved here as well. Many of the JFK assassination researchers are blinded by a lib eral bias and they have a liberal axe to grind. Because of that they seem to see JFK as the victim of some Republican - oriented, Richard Nixon - orchestrated right - wing conspiracy (even though real \"right wingers\" certainly don't think of Nixon himself as bei ng one of their own). These researchers are fixated on the image of JFK being some sort of liberal icon. However, the irony of the situation is that one of the pet liberal causes — support for the state of Israel and its demands on the American taxpayers — was not something that JFK was promoting during his presidency. Instead, JFK was at war behind the scenes with Israel. It's all documented, of course, but these researchers are loathe to admit it. Plus, I might add, they have their friends in the Israeli lobb y whispering in their ears and saying, \"Don't pay attention to that man behind the curtain.\" Now there is money involved in all of this. The JFK assassination has spawned a thriving mini - industry and the authors and publishers are at war with each other in the struggle for recognition and respectability. I suppose I'm shut out on both accounts, but the other researchers do have a shot at the big time and they'll never achieve any major financial success if they make the mistake of pinpointing Israel's role in the assassination. Film - maker Oliver Stone now plays a major role in this mini - industry, as I've pointed out. JFK writers trip over one another trying to get Stone's endorsement for their books and Stone is not about to promote anything that would even dare hint at Israeli involvement in light of the facts that we know about Stone and his Israeli associates. Stone has liberally sprinkled money among the ranks of JFK assassination researchers whom he employed as \"consultants\" to his film and this, too, ha s had an impact on the growth of independent research. Likewise we find another factor. One firm that has issued several JFK assassination books, Shapolsky Publishers (now defunct), was an affiliate of an Israeli publishing company. People hoping to get th eir books published don't want to express any opinions that might prevent their works from being shelved. People know where their bread is buttered. There was one firm, Carroll & Graf, that I twice attempted to interest in Final Judgment , both before the i nitial publication and after the publication of the second edition. The first time they never even sent me a letter of rejection. They simply sent the manuscript back. The second time I wrote them I did get a letter back from Mr. Carroll himself after I po inted out that I had not even gotten a formal letter of rejection. His note was very curt saying, \"We can't use your manuscript at this time,\" although since then he has issued a number of JFK assassination books."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"661 Questions & Answers [565] Carroll & Graf do know something about J FK books. Jim Marrs' best - selling book Crossfire is a Carroll & Graf product. They've also issued books by one rather unusual JFK writer named Harrison Livingstone (whom I've discussed in Final Judgment) and those books have been best - sellers. But Carroll & Graf were not interested in Final Judgment. And I'm certain that it wasn't because the book was an illiterate piece of trash. So, in the end, there are 1) personality conflicts 2) political conflicts and 3) financial concerns that prevent all of the vari ous JFK assassination theorists from either working together or, in my own area of interest, working to explore the thesis laid forth in Final Judgment. There are many people who believe that the story of JFK having an affair with actress Marilyn Monroe i s a myth. Yet you devoted an entire chapter in Final Judgment to the subject. Aren't you falling into the trap laid by the media dredging up the Marilyn Monroe myth? The chapter on the Cohen - Monroe - JFK connection was not critical to the thesis expressed i n Final Judgment. The book could have been published without this chapter and it would not have detracted in any way from the overall thesis. I included the chapter for a number of reasons: 1) it emphasizes the fact that there is this strong Jewish and pro - Israeli influence in the arena of Organized Crime, and specifically among those under the influence of Meyer Lansky. 2) Cohen did have a long - standing connection with Marilyn Monroe and it's interesting that his own memoirs which are rife with name - droppi ng never once mention her. It's worth mentioning, also, that Cohen's co - author, John Peer Nugent, was reputed to be a CIA operative and that Cohen himself has been mentioned as having been involved in the CIA's anti - Castro operations. 3) Cohen and Jack Rub y were very close and did have many mutual associates, including one Al Gruber. It was Gruber whom Ruby was in contact with for the first time in about ten years just after the JFK assassination. Gary Wean believes that Gruber is the one who gave Ruby the order to \"hit\" Oswald. I was frankly surprised by the number of people who did tell me that they didn't believe the stories about Marilyn Monroe and John Kennedy, inasmuch as I always believed the stories myself. However, I do know Gary Wean (my primary so urce on the Marilyn - JFK - Cohen connection) and I consider him a reliable source and felt it would be appropriate to include his information in the book. I have been told that Jim Marrs, the author of Crossfire, has disputed the reliability of Gary Wean and suggested that his allegations are not credible. My own suspicion is that Marrs is hesitant to give credence to Gary's allegations because Gary himself has pulled no punches in suggesting that there was Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination. I find it somewhat ironic that Marrs would single out Wean since there are so many sources that have been utilized by Marrs and others that I don't"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"[566] Final Judgment 662 know by what basis one determines which source is reliable and which isn't. Needless to say, I don't think Marrs is doing Gary Wean justice. It is interesting that the media has continually used the Monroe affair and other alleged affairs to downgrade JFK's reputation. Even Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was trashed by the media in the wake of her husband's death and her re - marriage to Aristotle Onassis. That marriage was presented as something less than savory. On the other hand, although Jacqueline had a ten - year live - in adulterous relationship with a married man, Belgian - born Jewish diamond merchant Maurice Tempelsman, that was quietly and carefully kept under wraps during that decade. Only after her death was it generally mentioned (and then only in passing) that the two had been living together and Tempelsman was painted as nothing less than a saint. This might have s omething to do with the fact that Tempelsman had long - standing ties to the CIA and the Mossad as a result of his ventures in Africa where both intelligence agencies have played a major role in recent years. So the media didn't raise too many eyebrows about the Widow's affair with Tempelsman. Why don't you bring up the role of the Masons in the JFK assassination and cover - up? Isn't it true that all of the members of the Warren Commission were Masons? I don't know if all of the Warren Commission members wer e Masons. However, some, notably Michael A. Hoffman II, a very brilliant researcher, have demonstrated quite a bit of Masonic imagery in events surrounding the assassination. I don't dispute that. It's likely there was high - level Masonic support for the as sassination, particularly since JFK was a Catholic. Zionism and Freemasonry are both heartily anti - Catholic and do overlap in many areas of intrigue. No question about it. To understand the assassination in its most basic form, we need only look at JFK's c onflicts with Israel, Organized Crime and the CIA. That says it all. The loudest advocate of the proposition that I should blame the Masons was a character who viciously attacked one of my sources, Gary Wean, and after attacking Wean, later launched an Int ernet campaign to defame me as well. This character, among other things, says that my \"real\" name is \"Bernard\" Piper — not true — and that JFK never had any extramarital affairs. (Seriously.) Well, considering all of this, it's interesting to note that this ch aracter revealed to me in a letter that he was related to Ferenc Nagy, the Hungarian who was involved in Israel's Permindex operation which was most definitively an element in the JFK conspiracy. So this perhaps explains, at least in part, this character's ventilations. Why don't you report the role of the British Crown in the JFK assassination?"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"663 Questions & Answers [567] The Lyndon LaRouche organization has done outstanding work in studying the role of the British Crown in attempting to undermine American sovereignty. They've iss ued a report entitled Why the British Kill U.S. Presidents and in that work, along with Dope, Inc. (which I did cite in Final Judgment) they outline the British intelligence connections of people such as, for example, Colonel Louis M. Bloomfield, the chief executive officer of the Permindex company, along with New Orleans trade executive Clay Shaw, an Anglophile of long - standing. I do not dispute these connections. However, as much respect as I have for the work of the LaRouche people (all of which I find q uite valuable), I do not believe that they have pursued the Israeli connection far enough. But they certainly do highlight it in their research. The LaRouche group suggests that the Mossad is an arm of the British Crown. I don't buy that argument, but at t he same time I don't feel I have enough information to dispute it. However, I do believe there are firm grounds to say that the Mossad, on its own, as an arm of the Israeli government, had good reason (in its view) to participate in the JFK assassination c onspiracy precisely because of JFK's behind - the - scenes conflict with Israel. So if the British did indeed want JFK out of the White House and if they did utilize elements in the CIA and the Mossad and Organized Crime to carry out the crime, they certainly had willing participants who had reason on their own to participate, whether or not the order came from Queen Elizabeth. I don't always agree with the interpretations of the LaRouche organization, but their research is always worth examining on a wide vari ety of matters. I will point out that several other JFK researchers have relied upon LaRouche writings as part of their own research: Jim Marrs cites the LaRouche efforts in Crossfire, James DiEugenio cites them in Destiny Betrayed and even Oliver Stone hi mself in his published script of the film JFK (including commentary and annotation) cites the LaRouche organization for some of the material relating to Permindex. So if anyone wants to score me for using LaRouche material as a source, they better be prepa red to do the same regarding these other \"responsible\" researchers. What about the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)? Weren't many CFR members also on the Warren Commission? The CFR is one of the most important Establishment power groups. How could you f ail to mention the CFR? They probably ordered the assassination of JFK. There were CFR members on the Warren Commission. There's no doubt about the fact that the CFR is an important arm of the Establishment. Some would even call it THE Establishment in th is country. It's financed largely by the Rockefeller interests and their corporate allies. It's an exclusive foreign policy pressure group that has staffed virtually every key post in every presidential administration since Herbert Hoover — even including th e JFK administration. And, perhaps more importantly, CFR"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"[568] Final Judgment 664 figures have long - standing ties to the CIA. I have written extensively about the CFR over the years in other contexts. However, as far as the CFR being the source of the JFK assassination conspirac y, I do not believe that the assassination was ordered in a CFR conference at their headquarters in New York. There were probably CFR members who were privy to forehand knowledge about the assassination, but not necessarily in the context of their membersh ip in the CFR. For example, I seriously doubt that David Rockefeller, head of the Rockefeller empire and a leading CFR figure, was not aware that Kennedy was slated for assassination. The plot to kill JFK was an Establishment plot and Rockefeller is a part of that Establishment. I myself have ever referred to the CIA as \"the enforcement arm\" of the Rockefeller empire. The Mossad functions in much the same way. The high level financial forces that are behind the CFR are tied very closely to the European fami ly Rothschild which has been a prime force behind the state of Israel. Likewise with the Canadian Bronfman family which was an outgrowth of the Lansky Crime Syndicate. Today the Bronfman family is expanding its influence in the American media and that coul dn't happen without the approval of the Rockefeller empire. There are those who have suggested that the Rockefeller family considered the potential Kennedy Dynasty a rival to their influence and that is another factor to be considered. So, in that sense, t here's no doubt that the Rockefellers and their associates in the CFR would not stand in the way of a scheme to assassinate John F. Kennedy. It was in their interests for it to happen. In the end the Mossad and the CIA, if truth be told, are nothing more t han the enforcement arms of these powerful financial interests that also stand behind the Council on Foreign Relations. However I don't find the suggestion that the CFR was behind the JFK assassination to be as precisely provable in the way that you can do cument CIA and Mossad ties to the intimate players involved in the conspiracy. Why don't you ever report on the findings of former British intelligence operative Dr. John Coleman who has revealed the existence of a high - level group known as The Committee of 300 which Coleman says ordered the JFK assassination? Coleman says that Permindex, which you talk about in Final Judgment, was the assassinations arm of the Committee of 300. First of all, I must say that the first - ever reference I saw to the Committee of 300 is in the works of Dr. Coleman. After that, all references I have seen have been in books written by those who have reported on Coleman's writings on the Committee of 300. So essentially Coleman is the only primary source on the existence of this g roup. Just because many others have cited Coleman's writings doesn't mean the group exists. This is very important to remember. I don't dispute the possibility that there is such a committee in existence. There are high - level international power blocs such as the"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"665 Questions & Answers [569] Bilderberg Group (financed jointly by the Rockefeller and Rothschild families) and the Trilateral Commission. I've written extensively on both groups, including a widely circulated report on the Trilateral Commission. So it's conceivable that thi s secret committee that Coleman discusses does exist. But to the best of my knowledge Dr. Coleman has never exhibited any documentation that such a committee exists, although there is documentation about the Bilderberg Group. Frankly, I believe that gettin g involved in a debate over the so - called Committee of 300 is a distraction from the basics that people can understand: that CIA, the Mossad and Organized Crime all had distinct interests in removing JFK from office and that, as I demonstrate in Final Judg ment, all three groups closely intersected with one another in a number of areas and had the means and opportunity (not to mention, obviously, the motive) to have carried off the crime of the century and its cover - up. These are all interests that are appar ent — that can be documented — and which people do readily understand. Introducing some shadowy Committee of 300 into the equation takes the JFK assassination out of the realm of average understanding and does nothing to address the immediate issue. I am famil iar with Dr. Coleman's work and find it quite fascinating. However, I do have to state specifically that in his report on the JFK assassination, which I acknowledged earlier, I am sorry to say that Coleman made some misstatements of fact that detract from his credibility. For example, he states that if one of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's key witnesses against Clay Shaw, one Perry Raymond Russo, had been permitted to testify before the grand jury that this would have blown the JFK case wide o pen. In fact, Russo did testify and it was his testimony that led to Shaw's indictment. Coleman suggests that Garrison's prosecution of Shaw was halted before it ever reached a grand jury indictment. This just is not true and this is an error that could ca use people to doubt his credibility, considering that this is a basic fact that is very well known. In addition, Coleman says that Russo left for California before his testimony was ever heard. This didn't happen. What happened was that people who were try ing to sabotage Garrison's investigation offered Russo a job in California, but he turned them down flat and exposed them to Garrison who brought indictments for witness tampering against them! So again Coleman is mistaken here. Final Judgment never once mentions evidence that on the famous Zapruder film of the assassination there is visible proof that President Kennedy's Secret Service chauffer, William Greer, turned around and fired the fatal head shot at JFK using a pistol. This pistol is clearly visibl e on the Zapruder film and has been widely shown around the world. How could you ignore this vital evidence? Are you trying to cover up the truth that so many people now know? I think the allegation that William Greer fired the fatal head shot is not only one o f the most ridiculous things I 've ever hear d, but also an"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"[570] Final Judgme nt 666 outrageous libel and slander of Greer. I'm told that Greer was absolutely devastated by the president's assassination and blamed himself for not getting the president's limousine out of line in time to prevent JFK from being killed. In fact, Greer was probably somewhat to blame for the death of the president since his reaction time was slow, to say the very least, and there would have been perhaps enough time to get the car out of the line of fire. But who am I to speculate? Be that as it may, what one sees on the Zapruder film (which I have seen in various renditions) is not — I repeat NOT — William Greer or his fellow Secret Service agent, Roy Kellerman (who was riding in the right - front passeng er seat of the Kennedy limousine) turning around and firing a pistol at the president. Consider this for a moment: if indeed Greer had done that he was putting himself in the position of being seen by several hundred spectators, including quite a few who w ere standing within some twenty feet of the limousine. Secondly, Greer was being photographed by more than a handful of people at the time. It's inevitable that at least one of the witnesses on the scene would have indeed witnessed Greer doing this. If Gre er had done this, he would also have been witnessed so doing by Governor and Mrs. John Connally who were less than two feet from him and literally looking into his face. They would have practically been in the line of fire if Greer had fired the fatal head shot. And they most definitely were not looking at the president at the time his head exploded. I have seen the rendition of the Zapruder film by the promoter of this theory. I have seen the flash of light that appears to be a pistol and I can understand how somebody viewing the film would believe that they are seeing what they are told they are seeing. However, it is a flash of light. It is evident that Mr. Greer is turning and looking at the president just before the fatal shot, but you are most definite ly not seeing him shoot the president. Bear in mind that the Zapruder film is not a good quality film to begin with. It's shot at an oblique angle; it's shot hurriedly with a very shaky hand and there's a lot of motion on the film itself. However, the film does not portray Greer shooting Kennedy. I saw the film years ago and I've seen substantially enhanced versions, both with and without the narration and graphics that have been added by the person promoting this theory. And it's very clear that what you a re really seeing is a flash of light. It is the sun reflecting on the crewcut hair of the Secret Service agent, Mr. Kellerman. It is not Greer firing a weapon. I tested this theory myself using substantially - enlarged frames from the Zapruder film and it is very clear, if you hold these frames juxtaposed against the film that this is really what you are seeing: a reflection of light on the agent's head. However, when someone is looking at the film and hearing an audio narration, accompanied by a circle graph ic around the \"gun,\" it would appear to be just what the narration says it is: Greer firing a gun. But I rush to assure you that it is not the case."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"667 Questions & Answers [571] Those who are promoting this theory are either remarkably foolish or they are deliberately promoting disi nformation to confuse the JFK researchers even further and, for that matter, to make serious JFK assassination researchers look foolish. Both before Final Judgment was published — and after — I received a surprising number of inquiries about this matter and I am amazed that the rumor has such currency. However, I should point out that one person who had initially promoted this theory, one Lars Hansen, initially believed the story to be true. But he himself publicly repudiated his own previous stand on this matt er and said he didn't believe it after investigating further. Hansen, who has disappeared, is angry at the individual who is best known for promoting this theory, William Cooper, who continues to promote the theory and who has distributed a copy of the Zap ruder film (utilizing Hansen's narration) without advising people that Hansen had repudiated the theory himself. (I might mention, in passing, that Hansen went on an investigative mission to Iraq, following the Gulf War, that was sponsored in part by my ow n newspaper, The Spotlight .) So it is indeed William Cooper who is promoting this theory that Hansen has repudiated. Cooper says that he is a former intelligence officer and that he was privy to inside information about the assassination. That may well be true, but if his \"inside information\" is the story that William Greer fired the fatal shot, then that's misinformation and disinformation supplied by somebody else, perhaps even the real conspirators. For people to get distracted and bogged down in this ma tter and researching it is a waste of time. I've devoted a great deal of time to discussing this ridiculous story if only for the reason that there are still many people who believe it, much to my surprise. I might add that even if the story were true (whi ch it is not), the story would not discount the basic theory in Final Judgment for it could have been that Greer was part of the conspiracy that I outlined. But, needless to say, I don't believe that he was. All of this is not to suggest that there wasn't some sort of Secret Service complicity or that some Secret Service agents were compromised, either before or after the assassination. I have no firm evidence one way or the other, but I do know that the president's public exposure was such that as even JFK himself said that if somebody really wanted to kill him, they could. All in all, the conspirators really didn't need Secret Service complicity to accomplish their goal. Why didn't you reveal in Final Judgment that JFK was about to reveal to the American people the truth about the existence of alien forces from other planets that had visited this world? There's a great deal of evidence that the government has been keeping this a secret for years and that JFK was going to blow the lid off this high - level co ver - up, resulting in his assassination. I've had this question addressed to me numerous times. So much so that I start wondering why theories such as this receive such widespread"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"[572] Final Judgment 668 discussion when more down - to - earth theories such as the one I present in F inal Judgment don't seem to get much recognition. I hasten to add that I have never disputed that there is much more to be learned about UFOs and other strange phenomenon that is not of our world or of this earth. I myself believe that on two separate occa sions I have seen objects in the sky that cannot be explained by the official government explanations (or non - explanations as the case may be). Members of my family have also seen UFOs. What's more, I've done a great deal of reading in this area and I do k now that there has been government research (and cover - up) in this field. However, I must advise those who are interested that there are many reputable UFO researchers who have described one widely - circulated story about a high - level secret government repo rt on UFOs to be a hoax. And it is this story that is the basis of the claim that JFK was about to reveal the existence of alien visits from other worlds and that it was for this reason that he was shot. Despite this, many sincere people have never learned that the story has been generally repudiated as a hoax and, as a consequence, many sincere people continue to give it credibility. Obviously, as I've suggested, I think there are more down - to - earth reasons (no pun intended) which sparked the JFK assassina tion conspiracy. Now I will say for the record that I think it is possible that if JFK did, in fact, have access to some sort of secret government information on this subject that he may have had the intention of revealing it to the American people. But wh en one is discussing the JFK assassination and begins bringing in such stories that not only muddy the waters but also cause people to look askance at JFK researchers it does not give a great deal of credibility to the field. There was enough trouble convi ncing people that JFK had been a victim of a conspiracy and there's been enough trouble trying to determine who was behind the conspiracy. Why bring in a completely different and controversial field such as UFO research and try to combine the two? (I mysel f have caused enough commotion with Final Judgment by introducing the Mossad element and I have good solid evidence for that!) I think that there are people who are deliberately inserting this UFO controversy into the JFK assassination research field for t he deliberate purpose of making JFK researchers to appear ridiculous — and that is the result, I'm sorry to say. As it so happens, it is the aforementioned William Cooper (who is the primary promoter of the theory that \"The Chauffer Killed JFK\") who has also been a prime force behind promoting the theory that JFK was killed because he was about to reveal the existence of alien life forces visiting this planet. Cooper has said that his \"inside\" sources from his years as an intelligence officer say that this is the reason that JFK was killed and that the Secret Service chauffer, William Greer, was recruited by the conspirators who wanted to keep JFK quiet about the alien visitors. And there are many people who accept this nonsense as the truth. I frankly regret that Mr. Cooper has received such widespread publicity. These stories do nothing to assist finding out who was behind the JFK assassination"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"669 Questions & Answers [573] conspiracy and only give people reason to doubt serious research of any kind. After Cooper was gunned down followi ng a confrontation with police officers in his home town, a lot of people took this as \"proof\" that Cooper was right all along, but it was anything but that. The only thing Cooper accomplished was adding confusion to the lore of the JFK assassination. In Final Judgment you never mention JFK's speech at Columbia University ten days before he was assassinated in which he said, \"The high office of President of the United States of America has been used to foment a plot to destroy America's freedom, and before I leave office, I must inform the citizens of their plight.\" Many publications have quoted this speech over the years. I have seen this quote appear in dozens — if not hundreds — of newsletters over the last 20 years. I have been asked time and again why I h ave not mentioned this \"famous quote.\" There's a very simple reason: I have never seen any single source verifying that JFK did indeed say such a thing and I've never even seen any documented proof that JFK did give any speech at Columbia University at the given time. Frankly, this type of rhetoric doesn't even sound like JFK and if JFK did intend to reveal any such plot and inform the citizens of their plight, it seems logical to me that JFK would have waited until he got into his second term before undert aking any such effort to stop this plot. What's more, if JFK did indeed say this (which I don't believe that he did), it seems unlikely that the conspirators would have been able to rush into action within ten days to dispatch JFK to the great beyond simpl y because he made this ambiguous remark. No one ever quotes anything else other than that particular sentence from that purported speech. So I would ask these people to supply the source. Supply a copy of the speech. What was the context of the quote, let alone the entire speech? The bottom line is that I don't believe that the statement was ever made in any public speech by President Kennedy. And this quote does nothing — absolutely nothing — to advance research into the JFK assassination and I wish people wou ld drop it altogether. These kinds of things gain such immense currency. There are probably more people who are aware of this quote (or \"non - quote\" as the case may be) than there are who are aware of the allegations I make in the pages of Final Judgment. The son of Roscoe White, a now - deceased former Dallas policeman, has come up with evidence suggesting that his father was one of the assassins on the grassy knoll. What do you think of his allegations? I don't think much about the allegations one way or a nother. If Mr. White's father was involved in the assassination conspiracy, it has no immediate bearing on the thesis in Final Judgment. Roscoe White could very well have been a CIA operative, as his son contends, and he could have been one of the assassin s and I have no evidence contradicting either claim."},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"[574] Final Judgment 670 He could have been one of the assassins recruited by the real conspirators. I understand that some JFK assassination researchers dispute the story told by White's son, but there are many people who do b elieve him and believe that he is sincere. If White was working for the CIA, though, it would indeed suggest CIA complicity. However, of course, because somebody happened to be working for the CIA doesn't necessarily mean that he was recruited for the crim e by the CIA. After all, a CIA operative could have been recruited by Icelandic intelligence to carry out the crime, if I can be so facetious as to suggest that. In the long run, however, the Roscoe White puzzle is only a very small piece of the bigger puz zle. In your analysis of the JFK assassination, you contend that there was a French assassin (or assassins) involved in the crime. Were these assassins members of the French Secret Army Organization (OAS) or were they members of the French Corsican Mafia? You are not clear on this in Final Judgment. First of all, I must say that the French Connection to the JFK assassination conspiracy is very complex indeed. As I pointed out earlier, I did not fully understand the French Connection until after I had actu ally finished the first draft of the book in which I had made passing reference to the allegations of such a connection. To analyze the facts that are important, in order to clear away any confusion, it's important to analyze what the French Connection rea lly is. In the early 1960's French President Charles DeGaulle decided to grant independence to the French colony across the Mediterranean in Arab Algeria. Many French colonials in Algeria (not to mention Frenchmen at home) objected to DeGaulle's decision a nd considered it a betrayal. They were fearful that the indigenous Moslem Arab population would oppress the French Algerians and considered DeGaulle's measure a blow to French national dignity. Regardless of the merits, there were factions that developed. Although DeGaulle was head of the French government, his own intelligence agency, the SDECE, was heavily divided over the issue of Algeria. Likewise with the French military. The more radical critics of DeGaulle's policy on Algeria formed the OAS. There we re many public supporters of the OAS, but there was also quiet support for the OAS within the SDECE. At the same time, Israel opposed Algerian independence — fearing another Arab foe — and there were many French Jews and Israelis who supported the OAS. There w ere even Jewish paramilitary units formed in Algeria in support of the OAS. And many Israelis actually enlisted in the ranks of the OAS. In the ranks of the SDECE there were many who had close ties to Israel's Mossad, in light of the long - standing close re lationship between the SDECE and the Mossad, stemming from DeGaulle's own early close relationship with Israel. As I point out in Final Judgment, it was, in fact, high - level SDECE official, Georges DeLannurien, who, at the behest of"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"671 Questions & Answers [575] Mossad assassinations chief Yitzhak Shamir, who contracted out one or more of the assassins who were deployed in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Here is where perhaps the confusion comes in. The SDECE utilized the talents of Corsican Mafia figures to combat the OAS. (The Corsican Mafia, should not be confused with the Sicilian Mafia, which is far better known and from which some of the Italian - American crime families known as \"the Mafia\" are descended.) In turn, the Corsicans were heavily tied up in the international drug racket o ut of Southeast Asia and were key players in cementing the drug network set up by Meyer Lansky who personally visited the Corsican mob figures to make the necessary arrangements. These French Corsicans were then later used by DeGaulle's intelligence forces to fight against the OAS rebels. What's more, these French Corsicans were also used by the CIA to fight French communist influence in the post - war era in Europe. And it was none other than the Mossad's man at the CIA, James Angleton, whose Mossad desk was responsible for coordinating the CIA's relations with these Corsican Mafia figures. Then again, we have the OAS. The OAS was composed of loyal Frenchmen who were, however, disloyal to Charles DeGaulle. Furthermore, the CIA itself was lending covert suppor t to the OAS (although the CIA denies it to this day). This inevitably ties back to James Angleton who himself maintained long - standing close ties in French intelligence. So you had an unusual configuration in which Israel had ties to both the anti - DeGaull e OAS (which opposed Algerian independence) and to the Corsican Mafia (who were in the Israeli - linked Lansky Syndicate) which was working to fight the OAS on behalf of DeGaulle. Also, of course, the CIA was tied to both. Complicated indeed! Add this other element: there is evidence that the OAS itself became involved in the Lansky syndicate's drug racketeering to finance its efforts in fighting DeGaulle. So you had both the OAS and the Corsicans engaged in business deals with CIA - and Mossad - connected drug s mugglers in the Lansky syndicate. In the end there was a truce between DeGaulle and the OAS and DeGaulle's own intelligence agency actually arranged work in international covert action for OAS men who were then in exile. Some of them were even deployed int o the CIA's operations in the Caribbean involving the Cuban anti - Castro efforts. This perhaps complicates the matter even further. However, you do find the fingerprints of not only the CIA and the Mossad and the Lansky syndicate in the activities of the OA S (both before and after the conflict with DeGaulle) but also in the activities of the French Corsican Mafia. It's an inter - connecting series of events and personalities that stem directly from the internal French conflict over Algeria. As a consequence, i t's anybody's guess as to whether it was an OAS assassin or a French Corsican assassin who was ultimately deployed into Dallas. Your guess, in short, is as good as mine. There are so many French connections that go to Dallas, including, of course, an Ameri can gun - runner, Thomas Eli Davis III — who not only had ties to the OAS, but also to Jack Ruby."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"[576] Final Judgment 672 To study the intrigue of the French conflict over Algeria and the French intelligence services is to study a hornet's nest of the worst sort. I do believe that in the pages of Final Judgment, however, that I have assembled a more complete overview of the reality of what the French intrigue was truly all about and how it was indeed linked to the JFK assassination. We will probably never know the exact specifics, b ut absolutely no other JFK researcher has examined the French Connection in the detail I have. But to fully examine the French Connection is to divine the Israeli Connection. At one point during the writing of Final Judgment I was so frustrated by trying t o make all of this complex material understandable that I pondered the possibility of not mentioning it at all. However, I realized that I would be doing a disservice not only to the readers, but also to myself. I would know that I had left out a critical part of the story. But it all fits together. If anything, as many readers have suggested, the detailing of the \"French Connection\" is the icing on the cake. You never mention the Gemstone Files in Final Judgment, yet this theory on the JFK assassination h as been in circulation for years. Frankly, I don't believe that the Gemstone Files are worthy of discussion, but since so many people have brought up the subject, I feel compelled to comment. The history of the Gemstone Files is convoluted and although ev idently the files themselves have been seen by a few folks — contrary to what I suggested in earlier editions of Final Judgment — the story of the files is a tangled one. Despite this there have been several books written devoted to the Gemstone Files, all wri tten in an attempt to analyze these materials. I must point out that these writings, however, are devoted to an analysis of what is called \"The Skeleton Key\" to the Gemstone Files — not the files themselves. It is \"The Skeleton Key\" most people have seen and which most talk about — not the files themselves. That's important to remember. The so - called \"Skeleton Key\" is a fanciful compendium of a wide variety of inter - related conspiracy theories centered around the JFK assassination and rife with things that are either so obviously in error or so outlandish that they are not worth commenting upon. There may be grains of truth in \"The Skeleton Key' but they are nothing so highly significant that they even deserve the attention I am giving them here. What is interes ting about the Skeleton Key is that one version I obtained actually made mention of a Mossad connection to the JFK assassination. Who put it there — or laundered other to delete the Mossad references is a good question. However, some panty - waist \"conspiracy theorists\" who dreaded mentioning the Mossad for fear of accusations of anti - Semitism may have been responsible for deleting the reference. I first became aware of \"The Skeleton Key\" when I saw a xerox of a xerox of a xerox of it when it appeared in my off ice many years ago. It's a single - spaced typewritten document of about twenty pages, a narrative that suggests that the real head of the world - wide crime syndicate was Aristotle Onassis and that the Kennedy family worked with the crime syndicate."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"673 Question s & Answers [577] Ultimat ely, so the story goes, the crime bosses killed JFK and were responsible for the Chappaquidick Scandal involving Teddy Kennedy, Watergate and other affairs. As I mentioned, \"The Skeleton Key\" has been subsequently reprinted in a number of editions containi ng extensive \"documentation,\" supplementary newspaper articles making reference to material in the Skelton Key, assorted analyses and commentary, etc. One such volume which appeared several years ago (to much fanfare in some circles) takes the Skeleton Key apart line by line and provides reprints of magazine and newspaper articles that refer to the material in the Key. For example if there is a reference to one of Aristotle Onassis' business dealings, there may be an article relating to that subject. The en tire volume is of that nature. And it proves absolutely nothing other than to reprint a raft of old news articles. Yet, as I say, there is this incredible infatuation with the Skeleton Key. I would challenge those who have spent such time devoted to this s ubject to do likewise with Final Judgment. I would welcome an intellectual challenge of this caliber. I've seen theorists debating the Gemstone material virtually ad nauseum in the pages of conspiracy - oriented publications. The much - touted Grande Dame of C onspiracy Theorists, Mae Brussell, helped popularize the Skeleton Key and she had a type of cult following. Mrs. Brussell seemed to find a Nazi under every rock and that has an appeal in some circles. One of her disciples is a character named Dave Emory. I discussed her theory that \"The Nazis Killed JFK\" in Chapter 15. One of the recent elaborations on the Gemstone Files included the patently ridiculous allegation that Mark Lane is, in reality, a CIA operative who was attempting to thwart an honest investig ation into the murder of JFK, even though, of course, it was Lane who first brought widespread public attention to the fact that the Warren Commission Report was a fraud and therefore publicly dismantled the CIA - assisted cover - up. This false claim about La ne (since withdrawn and repudiated by the publisher) was based on disinformation (much of it generated by the CIA itself) that has been deliberately circulated over the years to muddy the waters into JFK assassination research further. In any case, if this is the kind of \"research\" involved around the Gemstone Files, I have reservations about giving them any credence as should any serious student. The Gemstone Files business, as I say, is really an exercise in futility mainly because of the fact that no one has ever seen such files, despite all the literary writhings (and I don't mean \"writings\") in relation to the supposed files. I tend to think that the Gemstone Files — or I should say \"The Skeleton Key\" (since no one has seen the files) — is one of the most p ersistent hoaxes that's ever been foisted on JFK assassination research. But, additionally, because so many reasonably intelligent people have put so much time and energy into the matter (and even made a little money in the process), it has indeed taken on a life of its own. However, I have yet to see any serious discussion evolving from the Gemstone Files. In short, it's a big waste of time. Don't waste your time on the subject."},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"[578] Final Judgment 674 Doesn't the mysterious Torbitt Document that has been widely circulated over the last 25 years contain some valuable information about the JFK assassination? You never mention it in Final Judgment, yet this document touches on the Permindex Connection! The Torbitt Document — much like the Skeleton Key to the Gemstone Files — has been copied and re - copied and circulated throughout the country for many years. Purportedly written by a Texas attorney with connections to high - level political figures, this document has indeed been read by many people. It's an informative document that does touch on Clay Shaw's connections to Permindex — although it never mentions the Israeli connection even once. However, I have to say that the document contains just enough untruthful information (or otherwise leaves out pertinent information) to lead me to be lieve that a) the person who prepared it was sloppy in his research or didn't go far enough; or b) it was prepared as deliberate disinformation. I tend to think it is the latter. It has been said that the document came into the hands of Jim Garrison at the time of his investigation of Clay Shaw and it may have indeed have been part of the reason why at times the Garrison investigation seemed to go off in many different directions — one of the most frequent criticisms leveled at Garrison by his critics in the Establishment media. The Torbitt Document, also seems to have influenced the aforementioned Mae Brussell — or vice - versa. The document also suggests Permindex may have been a \"Nazi\" operation, but obviously nothing could be further from the truth. One primar y example of how off - base at least one item in the document really is — and because of this alone I have to be amazed at how widespread the devotion to the document is — happens to be the contention that Jack Ruby was of White Russian descent, hinting that the anti - communist White Russians (who had later allied in many instances with the Nazis) were behind the assassination and the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald. Jack Ruby was purely Jewish in origin. There's a very big difference indeed. How any devotee of the d ocument could pass by that and not wonder about the reliability of the document is an interesting question indeed! There is another even more significant error in the document (and I think it's probably deliberate) that essentially has the effect of whitew ashing the Israeli connection altogether. In a 1996 edition of the document, issued by Adventures Unlimited Press under the title \"NASA, NAZIS & JFK,\" the Torbitt Document on pages 62 through 66 states emphatically that mob money was being laundered throug h the \"Credit Suisse\" bank and cites Ed Reid's book, The Grim Reapers, as the source for this. Well, first of all, Ed Reid's book does not refer to \"Credit Suisse\" at all. Instead Reid's book (pages 130 - 132 in the 1970 Bantam paperback editions) refers to the International Credit Bank, which, of course, is the English rendering of Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum's Banque De Credit Internationale (BCI). The fact is that Credit Suisse and BCI were two totally"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"675 Questions & Answers [579] different banks. Neither was a subsidiary of the o ther, nor does Reid ever suggest as much. However, the Torbitt Document's misinformation (and misstatements of Reid's actual statements) has the effect of hiding precisely which bank was the primary funding agency for the Permindex group. By directing atte ntion away from Rosenbaum's BCI, the Torbitt Document is thereby directing attention away from the Israeli connection, all the while trying to find some \"Nazi\" connection. I realize that all of these facts will do nothing to convince people such as Kenn Th omas and Dave Emory and others that there really was not a Nazi plot behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy, it might make a few honest researchers realize that the Torbitt Document simply isn't really that reliable. But it gives the hobbyists a horse to rock around on, for sure! I have to say that I was astounded to see that in his 1996 introduction to the Torbitt Document that Kenn Thomas cited Final Judgment in a footnote when he said that Major Louis Bloomfield's \"links to the Meyer Lansky crime sy ndicate and his controlling interest in the Permindex corporation have been the subject of further recent study.\" That's all well and good — and quite true — but Thomas never once (not once) made any reference to the real point of my examination of Permindex: its Israeli connection. So inasmuch as the original Torbitt Document did appear around the time of the Garrison investigation, my feeling is that once the investigation was underway and it became apparent that Garrison was touching too closely into Shaw's connections to Permindex that somebody decided that it was time to cook up a \"mysterious document\" and give it some circulation and get it into Garrison's hands in order to point him in the wrong direction by mixing up enough real facts with enough nonsens e to muddy the waters and confuse Garrison and his investigators altogether. We're talking about good old - fashioned disinformation. The Torbitt Document has taken on a life of its own. It's appeared on the computer networks. And because it's one of these \" underground\" documents, it unfortunately seems to have a greater credibility among some people than things that are more aboveboard. In his book, Called to Serve, Colonel Bo Gritz relies on this document and as a consequence many of those who have read the book or heard Gritz speak have had their views shaped by this document of unknown origin. The fact that the document has such widespread devotion continues to amaze and puzzle me at the same time. However, I would urge people to avoid relying on this docu ment. That's one reason why I never once referenced it in the pages of Final Judgment. Are there any connections between the assassination of Martin Luther King and the assassination of John F. Kennedy? I want to emphasize that I have not studied the ass assination of Dr. King in detail. Those who are interested in the subject should refer to at"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"[580] Final Judgment 676 least the following books: 1) Murder in Memphis by Mark Lane and Dick Gregory. Mark represented Dr. King's accused assassin, James Earl Ray, in several of his le gal battles and Gregory, like Mark, has investigated both the JFK and King assassinations; 2) Orders To Kill by William Pepper, an attorney who has been representing Ray in recent years. This book (and its follow - up, An Act of State) demonstrate that there is much, much more to the King case than meets the eye; and last but far from least: 3) James Earl Ray's own book, Who Killed Martin Luther King? I had some correspondence with Ray over the years and once had the opportunity to speak with him over a radio show. Ray was quite a writer and his book is absolutely fascinating. It's one of the most dramatic books I've ever read, because it's written in Ray's own words. As far as any connections between the King assassination and the murder of JFK, there do seem to be connections between people tied to Carlos Marcello, the New Orleans Mafia boss, to the King assassination. And needless to say there are also indications of American intelligence involvement on many, many levels. When one considers the fact that the Israeli Mossad's American conduit, the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith spied extensively on Dr. King, one cannot help but think that there was intense (covert) hostility to Dr. King within the upper ranks of the American Jewish community. The ADL was turning its illicitly obtained intelligence on Dr. King over to the FBI, so frankly much of the hype that we hear about the FBI's persecution of Dr. King is evidence, indeed, of ADL involvement in this scandal. We should not discount the idea that the Israelis likewise had a hand in King's assassination in light of the ADL's complicity in waging war against the Black leader. King was most assuredly not a victim of a Ku Klux Klan or \"hate group\" conspiracy. He was a victim of an Establishment conspi racy and probably for the very reason that he was rocking the Establishment's boat. King (along with another Black leader, Malcolm X, also slain, like King, under mysterious circumstances) threatened to bring the Black community out from under the heel of powerful forces within the Establishment who preferred to keep Blacks under control — in the slave pen, so to speak. There are more than a few who suspect that organized crime, too, may have played a role in the King assassination conspiracy, for the crimina l underworld, best personified by international mob kingpin Meyer Lansky, was making billions off the Black community through drugs, gambling, prostitution, labor racketeering and other money - making enterprises. King's push for Black self - assertion was a t hreat to Lansky and his cronies, as well as to their partners - in - crime in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, both entities we now know have been rife with mob - influenced corruption. What's more, King's growing respect among Third World leaders was a distinct threat to the CIA's international intrigues. In fact, much of the allegations that King and certain Third World leaders, Black and White alike, were \"communists\" or under the influence of communism came right out of the propaganda mills"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"677 Que stions & Answers [581] of the FBI and the CIA. All of this needs to be kept in mind by those who are inclined to take a negative view of Martin Luther King. You can indeed judge a man by his enemies. I would add, though, that I have, in fact, discovered s ome interesting items in William Pepper's books that do suggest, perhaps, that there is some sort of Israeli connection, or, at the least, that there are some leads that haven't been followed through (which do point, again, to an Israeli connection of some sort or another. I will say, up front, that I realize that this statement is going to cause a lot of people to say, \"Oh come on now. Piper's not satisfied with finding an Israeli connection to the JFK assassination. Now he's trying to link the Israelis to the King assassination.\" But bear with me. Hear me out. First of all, as we already noted in the chapter on Jack Ruby, William Pepper has noted, in his book, An Act of State, connections between Jack Ruby and James Earl Ray's ubiquitous handler, \"Raul,\" t o a Mossad - linked arms smuggling operation that was active at the time of the JFK assassination. So that's a Mossad connection any way you cut it. In his first book Orders to Kill, on page 435, William Pepper describes his inquiries into the background of Canadian Eric S. Galt whose identity James Earl Ray adopted during part of his wide - ranging travels. Here's what Pepper reports: \"I learned that Galt, who as we know was the executive warehouse operator at Union Carbide's factory in Toronto, had top secret security clearance. The warehouse he ran housed an extremely top secret munitions project funded by the CIA, the U.S. Naval Surface Weapons Center, and the Army Electronics Research and Development Command. The work involved the production and storage of 'proximity fuses' used in surface - to - air missiles, artillery shells, and LAWS . . . The company was engaged in high - security research projects controlled by the U.S. parent . . . Union Carbide's nuclear division ran the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oa k Ridge, Tennessee.\" (Don't forget, incidentally, in reference to the nuclear programs at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that, according to Dick Russell in The Man Who Knew Too Much, writing on page 361, that on July 26, 1963 someone signed \"Lee H. Oswald, USSR, Da llas Road, Dallas, Texas\" into the register at the Atomic Energy Museum in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. However, according to Russell, the FBI later determined that this was not Oswald's signature. So I ask: Is that a connection between the JFK assassination and the King assassination — or isn't it?) In August 1967, reports Pepper, Galt was \"cooperating with another 902 [Military Intelligence Group] operation that involved the theft of some of these proximity fuses and their covert delivery to Israel.\" According to Pepper, he obtained \"a confidential memorandum issued by the 902nd MIG on 17 October 1967 which confirms and discusses this operation, Project MEXPO, which was defined as a 'military material exploitation project of the Scientific and Technical Division ( S&T) . . . in Israel.'\""},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"[582] Final Judgment 678 So there is it is. Somehow James Earl Ray was steered into the use of the identity of a real life individual who did indeed have ties to Israel and its \"scientific and technical\" research — which, of course, points in the direction of nuclear development. Note, likewise, that the real - life Galt was linked to the \"scientific and technical division\" in Israel. And note also that Galt's company was indeed linked to Union Carbide's nuclear division. Thus, we again find not only an Israel i connection to the King assassination (however fleeting), but also an Israeli nuclear connection. And that, of course, is very interesting in light of what we know about JFK's conflict with Israel over nuclear weapons development. And believe it or not, t here's even a \"French connection\" — again involving the Israelis — that Pepper describes. Pepper reports (on page 234) that he met with Pierre Marion, the former head of the French SDECE to seek out French assistance in uncovering information about the King as sassination. According to Pepper: \"Marion insisted on intense secrecy. He agreed to tap his sources in French and Israeli intelligence. At one point he said to me, 'You are in great danger.'\" Upon this basis Pepper concluded that the French officer had con cluded that some part of the U.S. i n t e l l i g e n c e c o m m u n i t y h a d b e e n i n v o l v e d i n t h e K i n g assassination — although Pepper apparently never considered the possibility, instead, that perhaps French and Israeli intelligence, in fact, had some connection to the ass assination (which, of course, is precisely the case with the JFK assassination. In any event, according to Pepper, \"Sometime afterward France went through a turbulent change of government. Marion's inside sources became very nervous about discussing anythi ng sensitive. His Israeli sources claimed to have no information.\" Frankly, I continue to be amazed that people who otherwise buy the theory that while Israeli intelligence \"is the best informed in the world\" (as so many defenders and friends of Israel say ) they actually believe the Israeli claim that they have \"no information.\" Frankly, Pepper might have gotten more information about the King assassination if he would have asked his friends in French intelligence to ask their friends in Israeli intelligenc e to ask their agents in the Anti - Defamation League to turn over their files on Dr. King to Pepper. If the ADL was so ready to provide information on Dr. King (and other civil rights leaders) to the FBI, so why can't they do the same for Pepper? In any cas e, this is a question that Pepper needs to answer. I am not researching the assassination of Dr. King — Pepper is. So if Pepper is interested in following these leads (especially considering the context of the Israeli nuclear connection), I say: more power t o him. But don't count on him to follow - up on this matter. It should be noted that in his book, Who Killed Martin Luther King? Ray addresses his suspicion that his mysterious handler \"Raul\" may have been traveling in the company of a figure that Ray believ es may have been financier David Graiver. Ray mentions Graiver's involvement in the looting of the American Bank and Trust Company (ABT) of New York but does not mention something that he most assuredly also knew: the fact that ABT"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"679 Questions & Answers [583] was the restructured S wiss - Israel Trade Bank, originally founded by Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum. Having done his own research, and as a regular reader of The Spotlight (the newspaper by which I am employed), Ray knew that the looting of ABT by Graiver was determined to have b een a classic mob - style \"bust out\" in which the funds stolen from ABT were used to finance Israel's secret nuclear arms program. In fact, if truth be told, according to sources such as J. Orlin Grabbe and others, many of the savings and loans debacles of t he 1980s were, in fact, covert operations designed to provide looted funds to Israel's nuclear and national defense programs. While the New York - based Shapolsky publishers (an affiliate of the Israeli - based Steimatsky company) issued the well - researched Th e Mafia, CIA and George Bush by Pete Brewton, which pointed out CIA connections to the S & L debacles, the book did not delineate Mossad connections thereto. In any event, that's a subject for others to pursue, but it is interesting in light of Ray's havin g linked David Graiver to the Martin Luther King assassination conspiracy. It is also a matter of record (but seldom mentioned by researchers looking into the King assassination) that prior to the King assassination, James Earl Ray had been given two numbe rs by \"Raul,\" that Raul indicated Ray might contact if necessary. One of the numbers, in New Orleans, Ray definitely remembered to end with the numbers \"8757\" and vaguely remembered to begin with \"866,\" but he wasn't certain. In fact, Ray later determined on his own the New Orleans number 866 - 3757 (during the relevant time) was the number of the Laventhal Marine Supply company and Ray stated in his little - mentioned, self - written early appeal of his conviction that \"the resident listed in New Orleans was, am ong other things, an agent of a Mideast organization distressed because of King's reported, forthcoming, before his death, public support of the Palestinian Arab cause.\" (It is no speculation to suggest the organization Ray was referring to was the Anti - De famation League of B'nai B'rith.) Later, when Ray testified before the House Assassinations Committee he referred again to this mystery number and commented, \"I don't want to get into this libel area again and say something that might be embarrassing to — di sservice some group or organizations . . . he [King] intended, like Vietnam, to support the Arab cause . . . someone in his organization making contact with the Palestinians for an alliance.\" Again, Ray was obviously talking about King taking a stand that would upset the ADL, although he was talking around the subject without stating it directly. On his web site, assassination researcher A. J. Weberman — who has been associated with the pro - Israel Jewish Defense League (which is effectively an \"armed wing\" of the ADL) — has suggested that this reflected Ray's \"hatred for the Jews\" (in Weberman's words), but Weberman concluded that Ray \"blamed the Mossad\" for King's assassination, a fact that very few assassination researchers seem to be aware of. Ray was certain ly reticent to talk about it, knowing full well that he had enough on"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"[584] Final Judgment 680 his hands to start making accusations about the Mossad, but the fact that he did make these allegations is something that must be part of the record. Weberman himself went to efforts t o discredit Ray's findings, saying that he (Weberman) determined that another \"3757\" number in the New Orleans area, beginning with \"833\" — rather than the \"866\" that Ray vaguely remembered — was traceable to a motel where New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcell o maintained an office. However, Ray did not remember \"833\" as the number. He remembered (however vaguely) the number \"866.\" However, the motel number had been called by David Ferrie, linked to the circumstances surrounding the JFK assassination, so that d oes indeed make, at the very least, an unusual connection between the two assassinations that seems to have gone largely un - noticed. And in light of the Mossad connections to the JFK assassination which did swirl around the activities of David Ferrie, Guy Banister and Clay Shaw in New Orleans, it does suggest yet another \"Mossad link\" to the Martin Luther King affair. We do know that the King family has been under heavy media attack for having dared to come to the defense of James Earl Ray and this in itsel f is unusual, considering the previous favorable coverage of that family. We need not rehash the extensive influence of the Israeli lobby on the American media, but in the context of the information outlined here regarding possible Israeli connections to t he King assassination, we might logically conclude that these media attacks on the King family may relate to precisely that. What are your conclusions regarding the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Was there a Mossad connection as many have suggested? The c ircumstances surrounding death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. in a bizarre plane crash on July 16, 1999 added fuel to the fire started by Final Judgment implicating the Mossad in the death of young Kennedy's father. For my own part, I was quite frankly surprised when a very real \"Mossad connection\" to the JFK Jr. tragedy emerged quite openly in the press. According to a widely publicized report in the July 19 issue of The New York Post, JFK Jr. wanted to publish a story about the Mossad in his magazine. Thus, the immediate suspicion on the part of some conspiracy theorists — but not me, I might add — was that the Mossad had ordered Kennedy's assassination in order to stop the article from being published. It's an interesting theory, but highly unlikely. Many publicatio ns (even in the mainstream media) have published critical articles about the Mossad. In fact, however, there's another aspect to the Mossad angle that's far more provocative and one which most have missed. Here's the complete story. The report in The New Y ork Post was written by gossip columnist Cindy Adams and subsequently received wide play in the national press, including a report in the July 21 issue of USA Today. Adams reported that writer C. David Heymann had told her that ten days before the fatal cr ash, he and JFK Jr. had spoken and that JFK Jr. had expressed misgivings about the upcoming airplane flight (even though, by all other accounts, young Kennedy was quite enthusiastic about his new hobby)."},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"681 Questions & Answers [585] What created the buzz about possible Mossad involv ement was the report by both The New York Post and USA Today that Heymann was a U.S. - Israeli dual citizen who said that he had told young Kennedy, some years ago, that during the 1980s he (Heymann) had actually worked for the Mossad. It was for this reason that Kennedy had approached Heymann about doing a story for George on the Mossad — according to Heymann. But while conspiracy theorists on the Internet and elsewhere focused on the idea that JFK Jr. was about to \"blow the whistle\" on the Mossad, they missed what was actually more significant: That the widely - publicized claims of this Mossad figure were the primary media foundation for the insistence Kennedy's death was an accident — either his fault or, effectively, that of his wife Carolyn's — and one that was waiting to happen. The New York Post headlined the Heymann story \"John Jr. Feared Flying Into Vineyard\" and included Heymann's own detailed transcription of their conversation. USA Today reported that Heymann claimed he took extensive notes on his conversa tions with Kennedy for use in possible future books. According to Heymann, JFK Jr. didn't feel secure about the Martha's Vineyard airport; he didn't want to fly there; and he felt he had to do it because his wife insisted he drop off her sister there befor e going on to Hyannis airport. The bottom line of the former Mossad man's story is that JFK Jr. purportedly didn't feel comfortable about making two landings (at Martha's Vineyard and then Hyannis), because — or so Heymann says Kennedy said — \"I'm really not that experienced a pilot.\" So it just happened to be a self - described Mossad asset who was so coincidentally well positioned to put forth a widely - publicized story which played right into the media line that JFK Jr. shouldn't have been in the pilot's seat to start with and that he was flirting with disaster: that the tragedy was definitely an accident — almost an inevitability. In fact, by The New York Post so carefully (and craftily) emphasizing \"the Mossad connection,\" the newspaper (which is a consistent v oice for the interests of Israel) was effectively telling the world: \"This is what the Mossad wants you to believe about JFK Jr.'s death. It was an accident. It was JFK Jr.'s fault. It was an accident waiting to happen. Case closed.\" Now, here's the punch line: Cindy Adams of The New York Post — who first published Heymann's story — distanced herself from Heymann saying she doubted his story. And investigative reporter Andrew Goldman of The New York Observer published a devastating expose questioning whether He ymann ever had any contact at all with JFK, Jr. In fact, it appears that Kennedy hadn't even finalized his flight plans at the time that Heymann claims he spoke to Kennedy. So the bottom line is that Heymann's story was disinformation in the first place. N either, Adams nor Goldman, however, dared to suggest that Heymann's claims may have been Mossad - sponsored disinformation. The question thus remains: when this \"former\" Mossad agent put forth this fraudulent story about the last days of JFK, Jr., was he doi ng it for his"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"[586] Final Judgment 682 own perverse ends or was he doing it as part of a disinformation campaign ordered by the Mossad? It might also be no coincidence, as Israeli journalist Barry Chamish has pointed out, that an Israeli chauffeur, Yoel Katzavman, who had been d riving JFK Jr. around New York prior to the tragedy, also popped up to describe how young Kennedy's physical condition (due to a broken leg) was such that in Katzavman's words, it \"was really suicidal\" for JFK Jr. to have attempted his final, fatal flight. In fact, the Israeli chauffeur's version of events dovetails quite nicely with Mossad man David Heymann's tale. So is it a coincidence or is it a conspiracy? As we've noted, Chamish has suggested that John Jr. may indeed have heard about Final Judgment an d that this is what stimulated his interest in the Mossad. We'll probably never know for certain, although, as we've seen, Chamish himself has written a highly complimentary review of Final Judgment perhaps unsettling a lot of JFK conspiracy theorists who spent a great deal of energy attacking my theory only to have an Israeli journalist come aboard to say that the theory makes sense. For his own part, Chamish has caused quite a stir in Israel with his fascinating and well - researched study of the assassinat ion of Yitzhak Rabin, and in his book, Who Murdered Yitzhak Rabin? (available at $16 from Feral House Press, 2532 Lincoln Boulevard - Suite 359, Venice, California 90291) he has painted a fascinating picture that strongly suggests that Israeli intelligence was indeed involved in Rabin's murder. In the meantime, perhaps, it was not so surprising that in its July 16 issue that was on the stands when JFK Jr. died, Forward — one of the most influential Jewish newspapers in America — was featuring an item bellyachin g about the activities (50 years before) of young Kennedy's grandfather, the late U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Joseph P. Kennedy. In this context, it really should be noted that aforementioned Mossad man Heymann is a bit of an expert on the Kennedy dynasty' s purported \"anti - Semitism\" and the family's support for American neutrality and non intervention in the days prior to World War II. Careful readers of Final Judgment will note that in this edition (and in previous editions that were published prior to the demise of JFK, Jr.) are cited Heymann's reports published in his book about Jacqueline Kennedy (noted in Chapter Four) referring to the Kennedy family's collective opposition to the war. In addition, in his largely critical biography of the late Sen. Robe rt F. Kennedy, entitled RFK, the same Heymann charges that \"A number of people accused RFK of using [anti - Semitic] terminology when privately discussing Jews.\" Heymann also alleged that RFK's wife, Ethel, now the reigning matriarch of the surviving Kennedy clan, once told a Jewish publicist, that \"You know, it's your people who are giving us all the trouble; it's your people who are giving us all the trouble,\" when her husband was running for the Senate in 1964.

Are you enjoying the air conditioning? I know it gets pretty hot out there. Where are you these days, in the eighth circle or the ninth? Kind of a tough choice w here you’re concerned. After all, the eighth circle is for the fraudulent and the ninth for the treacherous. You sure were fraudulent when you had Mayor Daley fix the 1960 presidential election for your son Jack, weren’t you? And you were pretty treache rous most of your life, what with your compulsive philandering and double - dealing. But listen, that’s what I love about you. I can’t tell you how it filled me with pride just to know you back when you were America’s ambassador to England, saying a ll those nice things about Hitler, doing everything you could to prevent Jewish emigration from Nazi Germany. Thousands of Jews died because of you. That was quite a demonic performance! I always knew you had it in you. I don’t remember a soul I was happier to procure when you called on me back in, what, in 1912? You knew exactly what you wanted. You wanted w ealth, fame and power, and you wanted it to stretch through the generations . You wanted to be the creator of a dynasty what would rule America.. It did my ancient heart a bit of good to hear just how ruthless you could be. And you were such a tough negotiator it was fun doing business with you. It seemed like you’d thought of everything. You wanted access to power and for yo u that meant marrying the daughter of the mayor of Boston. Done; you and Rose Fitzgerald were joined two years later. You wanted to remain attractive and alluring to the world’s most glamorous women. Done; you became a motion picture executive and had affairs with Gloria Swanson and many other stars and starlets. You wanted wealth beyond the wildest dreams of any other Irish Bostonian. Done; you were a millionaire many times over, and lost none of it when the Great Depression hit. You wanted soc ial position. Done; you were given the most glamorous job in government at the time ― Ambassador to the Court of St. James. And you wanted your son to president. Done as well You dotted the “i”s, you crossed the “t”s, you did everything in your power to maximize your part of the d eal and minimize mine. Like all mortals whose most distinictive quality is their unbounded sense of self, you believed your soul was so valuable that it was worth the exchange. You got everything you wanted. But when a I make a deal for a soul li ke yours ― so unyielding in it sense of entitlement, so sure that the world should bow before it, so damned tough ― its raw to me, like uncooked meat. I need to season it, to pound on it a bit so that it becomes tender, brown it a bit on the fire before I am ready to put it in the infernal oven.

That was all your doing! And you seemed to be getting over young Joe’s death so well that I felt I needed to remind you of it by sending your daughter Kathleen down in another plane crash a few years later. Oh, this trouble hurt. But it infuriated you too, because you thought I had reneged on the deal! Remember that conversation, right there on the beach in Hyannis Port? I reminded you there was Jack, beautiful Jack, the one you rode so hard. He was so like you, so hungry for Hollywood beauty, so driven ― wouldn’t it be even sweeter if it were Jack? You were so triumphant with Jack’s victory and all that I tried to let you know that things weren’t going to work out like you planned again. You had a grandson born in the White House in August 1963, r emember? Little Patrick? I took him after two days, just to get you prepared for November 22. I said I‘d make Jack president. I didn’t say he would finish out his term. And I didn’t say you’d get another. That was your mistake, trying again with Bobby. That was a violation of the contract. You only got one. And you didn’t listen, you just wouldn’t listen, you were still intent on the idea that Teddy might do it ― Teddy, the least of your boys. But I have news for you. That Chappaquiddick business? He called on me to save him from a manslaughter charge. He’ll be keeping you company when his time is up. Your time was up, wasn’t it, after Chappaquiddick.

The Book They Tried to Ban: Reflecting on the Past, Present and Future of Final Judgment and its Controversial Thesis This book began with an extended essay ab out the controversy over Final Judgment, so it is perhaps fitting that it should conclude with an extended essay on the same topic. Like the opening essay, this \"final word\" is admittedly more about what has happened to Michael Collins Piper as a result of writing Final Judgment than it is about what happened to John F. Kennedy. Still, though, I think the readers will find it enlightening, for it all really does demonstrate that there are limitations on what one may — or may not — say in the debate over controv ersial issues such as the JFK assassination. There are many things to be said. The bottom line, though, is that Final Judgment is not going to go away. As much as the Israeli lobby may hate to admit it, the genie is out of the bottle. The future of Final J udgment will largely be a series of efforts to repudiate its thesis, but based on the efforts thus far, it doesn't seem likely that there is anybody out there who will be able to do it — and the reason may well be because the book is so very much on target. Final Judgment is, by no means, a demolition of the Warren Commission Report. The Warren Commission was discredited long ago. F i n a l J u d g m e n t i s s i m p l y f i l l i n g i n t h e m i s s i n g p i e c e s o f t h e puzzle — providing the missing link in the chain — demonstrating what's hidden on the other side of the jigsaw puzzle. The metaphors are endless, but the point is clear. We've known for a long time now that there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination — a big one — and that it reached some very high levels. Now we know in what horizontal directions the conspiracy also reached. One JFK assassination researcher, Vincent Salandria, has even gone so far as to suggest that, from the beginning, \"the Warren Commission's single assassin conclusion was designed to fall to pieces, was des igned to be incredible, was designed to self destruct . . . \"Make no mistake about it, the Warren Commission and its staff were made up of very able men. If these men had wanted to cover up the conspiracy more effectively they could have done so . . . \"He suggests that the conspirators who were behind the assassination ultimately wanted the American people to be demoralized and to know that they had lost their power over their destiny. And, frankly, in looking at the big picture, I'm afraid Salandria may be right."},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"687 Final Word? [589] 'THE HIDDEN TERRAIN' And although there are those who are trying to cope with the legacy of the JFK assassination and working to understand how this crime impacted on our nation, the big picture painted in Final Judgment (and one which is being accepted by growing numbers of people) is one that leaves many otherwise bombastic critics of government misdeeds standing silent. They just simply refuse to address the cold, hard fact that there is indeed strong evidence (on many levels) that \"tiny Israe l\" and its intelligence service, utilizing its own resources, and collaborating with its allies in the CIA, played a major role in the crime of the century. I know of one ostensibly independent \"maverick\" editor of a progressive magazine published in Orego n who instructed the writer of a proposed article that his reference to Jack Ruby as \"a hit man for the Jewish mob,\" be edited to refer to Ruby as simply being \"a hit man for the mob.\" However, the author of the censored article (a reader of Final Judgment ) responded to his editor with a very interesting letter, a portion of which I am sharing with the readers of Final Judgment, just as the author of the letter shared it with me. In his (private) letter to the editor, he summarized things quite well: Anyon e who has spent much time studying the assassination of John F. Kennedy knows three things for certain: Oswald did not do it; there are Jewish fingerprints all over the crime; and the Jews involved could not and did not act alone, but were part of a much b roader conspiracy involving elements of the Secret service, CIA, FBI, Justice Department, Dallas P o l i c e , T e x a s e s t a b l i s h m e n t , a n d C u b a n e x i l e community. It is precisely this Jewish involvement that has, in my opinion, hampered research into the crime . . . The result has been a widespread and continuing denial of Jewish involvement in the assassination that has grown now to include vicious attacks on the Kennedy family. T h e r e i s a l s o a h i d d e n t e r r a i n b e n e a t h t h e assassination that no one is talking about — th e secret terrain, the obscure, unacknowledged landscape underlying the Kennedy assassinations. Once it is illuminated, it will explain many of the seemingly pointless debates and confusions that have seriously hampered assassinate research, if not derailed it entirely . . . To my mind, it is Ruby's involvement in the assassination and the consequent Jewish fears of a pogrom in America that are like a plug in the nation's"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"[ 5 90 ] F ina l J udg ment 688 rectum. It won't let us purge ourselves of this crime and get past it. . . . T h e m y o p i c f e a r o f m e n t i o n i n g R u b y ' s Jewishness, and following his connections outward to Israel and international business and criminal syndicates, and inward to the Dallas Police and to judges and politicians, has bedeviled and divided the research community fro m the beginning. I couldn't put it any better myself. And, if anything, this letter (excerpted here) probably puts the matter in perhaps even better perspective (and more colorful prose) than Final Judgment itself. And so it goes. The fight to suppress Fi nal Judgment is not just being carried out by the Israeli lobby and its front - line shock troops in the Anti - Defamation League (ADL). In fact, self - styled \"researchers\" into the JFK assassination conspiracy are also leading their expertise to the effort. ' RESEARCHER' FIGHTS RESEARCH At the very height of the ADL's campaign to keep me from appearing at Saddleback College in Orange County, California (described in detail in the foreword) one of the ADL's most enthusiastic supporters was JFK assassination res earcher Debra Conway who operates an organization known as JFK Lancer. On September 7, 1997 she posted a message on a JFK discussion group on the Internet bragging of her efforts to stop me from speaking. Her message read: \"I called the college, the report er, and others to protest the seminar. I wrote a letter to the editor of the [Los Angeles] Times, with copies to the college president and board, but it was not published. I called and wrote to friends who are Jewish and told them of my position against th is seminar and why . . . I live in Orange County, California and I have also pledged to picket with the college professors and the Anti - Jewish Defense League [sic] against the seminar. I will not support anti - semitism in the guise of JFK assassination rese arch.\" Conway also posted her unpublished letter which added, in part: \"I have never seen any credible information on a conspiracy involving either Israel or the Nazis. Knowing that President Kennedy lead us in such turbulent times, there are many groups, countries, and persons who could be blamed for his assassination. You could make a case for them all if you do not look at all of the facts available.\" Of course Miss Conway never saw anything implicating Israel. It's supposed to be that way. It wasn't unt il Final Judgment put all of the data together that people actually started thinking that Israeli involvement was a real possibility. So it's interesting that, in a way, Miss Conway admits, indirectly, that there could indeed be an Israeli motive in the se nse, as she herself said, that there were \"many groups, countries and persons\" who could be blamed. But Debra Conway, I assure you, will never blame Israel."},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"689 Final Word? [591] Debra Conway's reaction to Final Judgment (which I'm not sure she's even read) illustrates the le ngths to which even some so - called JFK assassination \"researchers\" have gone to try to suppress Final Judgment and its thesis. I do have the satisfaction, however, of knowing for a fact that numerous followers of Conway's JFK - Lancer operation did contact h er and give her Hell for taking this stand and I am grateful to those who were kind enough to let me know that they did. So there are a few JFK researchers out t h e r e w h o d o b e l i e v e i n t h e F i r s t A m e n d m e n t , D e b r a C o n w a y notwithstanding. In the end, however, there were some heartening aspects of that otherwise ugly controversy in Orange County — Debra Conway's mean - spirited demagoguing notwithstanding. During the midst of the ADL's effort to silence me and to destroy Steve Frogue, many good citizens stood up in our defense. I never met the vast majority of them and nor ever will. But just recently I learned the identity of one of them. I had heard that a certain couple, \"Joe\" and Ethel Hunt, had been forceful critics of the ADL's antics, appearing at the college board's open meetings to speak out in defense of the First Amendment and against censorship. It turns out that \"Joe\" Hunt is no less than Retired Marine Colonel Forest J. (Joe) Hunt — a combat veteran of three wars and the former commander of all the Marine guards at U.S. Embassies around the globe and of the school that trained them in Virginia! That's the caliber of people I'm proud to have on my side. The ADL is more than welcome to have the likes of Debra Conway on their side. Colonel Hunt owes nothing t o anybody. But Americans owe a lot to people like Joe Hunt and his lovely wife who really do fight for freedom. In any case, the aforementioned efforts by Debra Conway were just the tip of the iceberg as far as efforts by self - styled JFK assassination \"tru th seekers\" to attempt to discredit me. Later, when I made limited efforts to engage a debate over the thesis of Final Judgment on various Internet discussion news groups dedicated to the subject of the JFK assassination, I found myself constantly bedevile d with accusations of \"anti - Semitism,\" all of which were leveled by self - styled \"researchers\" who had — at that point, anyway — not even read my book. SHIFTING THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSION Perhaps my most dedicated critic was one Robert Harris who operates his ow n JFK assassination web site on the Internet. Although Harris had a reputation for being \"hard - headed,\" even his critics would agree that, by and large, Harris was quite sincere in his dedication to finding out the truth about the president's murder. But w hen it came to the subject of possible Mossad involvement, Harris (who is said to be Jewish) lost all objectivity. Harris repeatedly made the false and malicious accusation that Final Judgment blamed \"the Jews\" for the Kennedy assassination when, in fact, as any reader knows full well, the book actually rejects that thesis altogether."},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"[592] Final Judgment 690 Constantly bedeviling me with \"JFK - related questions\" such as \"Do you think that mainstream historians are correct when they declare that the Nazis slaughtered (plus or minu s 5%) 6 million Jews?\" he also made references to the purported \"skinheads\" whom, he said, were the people who found the thesis of Final Judgment believable. At one point he even asked \"I wonder exactly how many black and Jewish friends Mr. Piper has in to tal\" and actually expressed outrage that I refused to list them by name, as though I should expose them to his defamations. Finally, though, I got so frustrated that I broke down and told Harris that one of my two godsons just happens to be an African - Amer ican child. He never responded to THAT. At one juncture, which just happened to be immediately after the Columbine shooting, Harris attempted to link me to that tragedy, suggesting the two disturbed young men had been inspired by evil \"anti - Semites\" like m e, not knowing at that point that the one shooter happened to be Jewish. The constant and quite frenzied name - calling by Harris reached that point that even one Jewish news group participant, Dave Reitzes — who was no supporter of mine, by any means — even cha llenged Harris by pointing out that criticism of Israel is not anti - Semitism. Another news group participant, Keith Bruner, came to my defense in defiance of Harris saying, \"Piper does not claim to have indisputable proof that the Mossad was involved, but he has drawn conclusions from certain facts that certainly paint a believable picture of involvement by the Mossad\" and went on to say, \"whether or not Piper is an [anti - Semite] he is pushing his book and his conclusions and should be challenged from that perspective,\" rather than by reckless name - calling. In another posting, Bruner said, \"Read his book, then attack him about his conclusions and evidence he presents. Debate with him. Let's talk about the murder of JFK\" (rather than the Holocaust). Bruner ad ded: \"Any information that will help lay the crime at the correct feet is good information, even if comes from the devil.\" The fact is that I sent Harris a complimentary copy of the book — despite all his attacks on me — and yet he still never once posted any item attempting to refute anything that I said in the book. 'TINY LITTLE ISRAEL WOULDN'T DO THAT!' After I finally asked Harris directly: \"Why do you believe that the theory that the Mossad could have been involved in the JFK assassination is `ludicrous' and 'outlandish' and 'nonsense,' etc?\" he responded on April 10, 1999 by saying: Even if Israel had wanted JFK dead, there was no need for them to take the risk of actively participating . . . if there was a slip - up and their participation was exposed, I srael would have been virtually doomed. They would have lost all credibility among civilized"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"691 Final Word? [593] nations, as well as their strongest ally. It is not out of the question that we could have even declared war against them. They stood to lose far more than they could ever gain. Clearly, this argument against Mossad involvement in the conspiracy simply does not wash. As I have pointed out, time and again in Final Judgment, the Mossad was insulated from exposure not only through its widespread contacts in the medi a, but also through its collaboration with the CIA, not to mention the very apparent effort by the Johnson administration and by the Warren Commission to keep the truth under wraps. What's more, under LBJ, Israel had a dedicated long - time ally in the White House, one who had benefited directly from JFK's assassination. So there was never any question that — if I am correct that the Mossad was involved, as I believe it was — the truth about Mossad complicity would never be exposed by any official U.S. investigat ion. For all his trouble, Harris ended up making history by getting sued for his attacks on other targets of his wrath. The New York Times of June 11, 1999 featured a story describing how Harris had been sued for inflammatory remarks that he had directed t oward another person with whom he had engaged in debate on the Internet. Yet, Harris is undaunted and continues to make his presence felt. More power to him. He'll probably be delighted to know that he's been mentioned in this new edition of Final Judgment . Another of my critics, Clint Bradford — who operates what is actually a very good web site of JFK - related material — formally declared that \"it is my personal opinion that your book is 'anti - Jewish hate prose' \" on a posting on March 16, 1999. Bradford prefer red to call me a bigot rather than to address any of the specific allegations made in Final Judgment. HERE COME THE NAZIS, AGAIN Another rather colorful Internet news group participant, John Bevilaqua, came up with the remarkable accusation that the buil ding on Capitol Hill in which my publisher's office is located was the headquarters of the German - American Bund during World War II. In fact, the building was owned by a Chinese - American businessman at the time, but Bevilaqua's allegations do reflect the n ature of the effort to repudiate my thesis through the contorted process of guilt by association, although, in this case, there was no such association! Bevilaqua also spent much energy trying to suggest that Final Judgment was a modern - day manifestation o f the statement made by a Georgia man, Joseph Milteer, to a police informant, Willie Somersett, that in the days following the JFK assassination an \"international underground\" of which Milteer claimed to be a part would orchestrate \"a propaganda campaign\" to \"prove to the Christian people of the world\" that \"the Zionist Jews had murdered Kennedy.\""},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"[592] Final Judgment 692 Well, no such propaganda campaign ever emerged. The last I heard was that the world was told that one lone nut — and a pro - Castro communist to boot — was responsibl e for the crime. Bevilaqua, in short, was spinning. Bevilaqua — who has a fetish about a purported \"Nazi\" role in the JFK assassination — believes that pro - Israel zealot James J. Angleton was actually anti - Jewish and pro - Nazi, but I won't even try to analyze t hat one! However, I must say, Bevilaqua did contribute one odd little item to the JFK debate when he put forth the thesis (which is evidently shared by several researchers) that longtime \"conservative\" figure Robert Morris may have actually been in the inf amous \"Maurice Bishop\" (often alleged to be CIA figure David Atlee Phillips) seen with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the JFK assassination. The fact is that if Morris was indeed \"Maurice Bishop\" this would point — once again — to a possible Mossad role in t he JFK assassination for during his career Morris was viewed by many in \"conservative\" circles as a water - carrier for Israeli interests and as an agent inside the \"right wing\" for the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. Morris' primary patrons were wel l - known characters known for their affinity for the interests of Israel including — but not limited to — such figures as \"mob lawyer\" Roy Cohn (co - owner of the Lionel Corporation which, in turn, held shares in the Mossad - controlled Permindex operation), Alfred Kohlberg a founder of the American Jewish League Against Communism, columnist George Sokolsky, and Marvin Liebman, a former gun - runner for Israel who was later the mentor of Israel's cheerleader, William F. Buckley, Jr. So maybe there's something there af ter all — yet Bevilaqua probably just doesn't get it. Three cheers to poor Bevilaqua for TRYING anyway. ISRAEL'S PERMINDEX PROBLEM Professor John McAdams — who operates an Internet web site devoted to debunking JFK assassination conspiracy theories — got into the act by trying to dismiss my accusations (and those of others) that Clay Shaw's involvement with Permindex was anything less than innocent and went so far as to post an article about Permindex on the Internet which suggested that allegations about Permi ndex were nothing more than \"communist disinformation.\" (And that sounds like \"McCarthyism\" to me!) In any case, while it is true that the Italian newspaper that surfaced some of the first data about Permindex was indeed a communist journal, that alone, of course, does not preclude the truthfulness of the details about Permindex and its controversial connections. Yet, the very article that McAdams posted made the factually incorrect statement that the origins of Permindex were actually connected to Clay Sha w himself and went as far back as 1948. Despite this, McAdams and his cheerleaders promoted this article to be the ultimate refutation of the theory that Permindex was engaged in international intelligence intrigue, whether connected to the JFK assassinati on or not."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"693 Final Word? [595] In a similar vein, longtime JFK assassination researcher George Michael Evica has referred to my documentation of the Mossad connections of Permindex as being part of the \"Communist\" false sponsors of disinformation in the JFK assassination an d described Final Judgment as being \"itself a valuable exercise in 'false flags,' patsies and inverted plots, but like the Garrison investigation, a major venting of False Sponsorship `leads,' which, paradoxically is its most significant value.\" Evica make s a good point that there has been quite a bit of disinformation relating to the JFK assassination in circulation over the years, but he is obviously unwilling to concede the possibility that those wonderful intelligence operatives at the Mossad had anythi ng to do with it. Evidently, in Evica's view, the Mossad is the only intelligence agency in the world that kept its hands clean as far as the JFK assassination is concerned. As I keep saying to people: \"If the Mossad and Israel loved JFK so much, why don't JFK researchers go to the Mossad and ask them to find out what really happened to JFK and settle the matter once and for all?\" But that would ruin all the fun, since, as we saw in Chapter 16 of Final Judgment, the Mossad already claims that the Mafia acci dentally killed JFK in a hit aimed at John Connally! Yet the defenders of Israel among the JFK researchers still don't seem to be satisfied with their wonderful Mossad's final solution. I wonder why? ' T H E C U S T O D I A N ' v s . ' T H E A U T H O R ' One Virginia McCullou gh who bills herself as \"the custodian and curator of the Mae Brussell Collection\" took issue with my description of Miss Brussell as being \"eccentric\" and declared in an Internet posting on Dec. 17, 1999 that \"Piper had his own agenda and part of that age nda was to discredit any researcher or any author but himself' but then went on to admit, contradictorily, that \"simultaneously Piper shows his undying admiration for the likes of Mark Lane, Seymour Hersh, Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, Stephen Green, etc.\" T hen, after describing my \"undying admiration\" for those other authors, McCullough once again contradicted herself by saying that in the pages of Final Judgment, \"the only author who comes out smelling like roses and is pure and clean is, of course, Mr. Pip er.\" (Figure that one out, if you can.) McCullough also expressed concern that, according to her, I \"refer constantly\" to myself as \"the author.\" (How else should I do it? If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!) She also adds that she considers my book \"written for the purpose of self - promotion and disinformation.\" But McCullough has yet to refute anything that appears in Final Judgment. McCullough's heroine, Miss Brussell, claimed that ex - Nazis had a hand in the JFK assassination and that a lik ely villain was former Nazi general Reinhard Gehlen who was drafted into the service of the West against the Soviets after World War II."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"[596] Final Judgment 694 But what McCullough doesn't like to have people mention is the fact — documented by Israeli writers such as Uri Dan an d others (and referenced in Final Judgment ) — that Gehlen also worked closely with the Mossad throughout the post - war years, despite his previous service to the hated Nazi regime. That's an uncomfortable little fact of history, to say the very least — especial ly for Israel and its supporters — but it does exemplify many of the uncomfortable facts about Israel that continually emerge in a study of the administration of President Kennedy, his relations with Israel, and the circumstances surrounding his assassinatio n. DID SHERMAN READ THE BOOK? Sherman Skolnick, the famed conspiracy researcher based in Chicago, made passing reference to Final Judgment in a report entitled \"Assassinations of the 20th Century — Why?\" and then commented that \"The book rejects, out of h and, what others claim, however, that Nazi war criminals were involved (as documented by the late assassination researcher Mae Brussell). And the book does not explain how the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, and the CIA, being the Protestant/Catholic Establi shment — how and why these espionage entities could have covered up all this for the benefit of the Jews.\" [Skolnick's emphasis] Frankly, I was a little disappointed by Sherman's comments. Over the years, I have found Skolnick to be right on target on a numb er of controversial matters, often sticking his neck out and daring to delve into subject areas (including the Mossad) that other researchers are afraid to address. Consequently, I was surprised that Sherman would describe the FBI and the CIA, for example, as being \"the Protestant/Catholic Establishment\" — when it is very clear that the FBI and the CIA have been co - opted into the service of the Mossad on more than one occasion — and then go on to question my conclusion that they had a part, as he put it, in cov ering up the Mossad role in the JFK assassination \"for the benefit of the Jews.\" (And, of course, the phrase \"the Jews\" is his term — not mine.) If anything, I believe that Final Judgment makes it all quite clear and I think that most readers would agree. Bu t that's Sherman's opinion. THE BIG GUN MISFIRES Perhaps my biggest disappointment, in a certain sense, was when the one critic whom I felt was probably best poised and best capable of refuting Final Judgment failed to do it. Of all of those I've encount ered who have been killed in marshaling facts and information in refuting at least certain aspects of a number of JFK assassination conspiracy theories, there is no question in my mind that Dave Reitzes is by far the most intelligent and articulate. Reitze s has made himself a minor celebrity in JFK circles on the Internet where he has quite energetically worked to demolish Jim Garrison and, in particular, defend"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"695 Final Word? [597] Clay Shaw fro m Garrison's allegations that the New Orleans trade executive was involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy. There are those who have called Reitzes a mouthpiece for the CIA — among other choice things — but whether he is or not, the fact is that Reitzes, more so than anyone else (in my estimation) has been a thoughtful and careful crit ic of Garrison. I've commented myself that Garrison's investigation was flawed in many ways and I will be the first to admit it. So I felt from my first encounter with Reitzes on an Internet news group that if anybody could raise questions in my own mind a bout my own thesis it would be Reitzes. In the end, though, I was wrong. I sent Reitzes a copy of Final Judgment and eagerly (if not a bit nervously) awaited his public review of the book. Dave had previously defended me (and I appreciated that) from alleg ations of anti - Semitism (based, at least, on what he had seen of my writings as posted on the Internet news group) and reserved a \"final judgment\" until he had actually read the book. I appreciated that. However, once Reitzes reviewed the book, I breathed a sigh of relief that the one person I thought might be able to give me reason to reconsider my conclusions in Final Judgment had failed to do so. Calling the book \"a morass of irrelevance,\" Reitzes surprised me when he took issue with my contention that what I called \"the controlled media\" had played a major part in covering up the truth about the JFK assassination conspiracy. He said that was \"sheer fantasy\" — evidently dismissing the very thought that the media had played a part in promoting the \"lone as sassin\" theory and defending the Warren Commission Report. Dave's review was quite extended and I could never do it justice in just this brief overview but basically what it boiled down to was Dave's particular pet peeve: his defense of Clay Shaw coupled w ith his thesis that Shaw's association with Permindex was not only entirely innocent but also that there is no evidence of any kind that Permindex had any connections to either the Mossad or the CIA or to any intelligence intrigue of any kind. He cited Cla y Shaw's own interview with Penthouse in which Shaw said, \"I have never had any connection with the CIA.\" The fact that Reitzes would even repeat Shaw's claim that he \"never had any connection with the CIA\" is remarkable, if only because of the fact that i t is thoroughly documented in de - classified CIA files that Shaw did indeed — at the very least — provide some thirty reports to the CIA over at least an eight year period, supposedly ending in approximately 1956. So Shaw did have a \"connection\" with the CIA. B ut Shaw was obviously lying to Penthouse, although, of course, the facts about Shaw's CIA connection didn't come out until some years after Shaw's death. In any case, Reitzes clearly has taken the position that anything Shaw said has to be believed — the evi dence notwithstanding. Shaw told Penthouse that he knew nothing about Permindex's activities and Reitzes believes him, but as I sarcastically told Reitzes, \"Sure. Clay Shaw would admit that Permindex was involved in all sorts of intrigue.\""},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"[598] Final Judgment 696 I guess Reitze s would have us believe that Permindex, at best, was some nice little company that exported Italian alabaster that Shaw used in refurbishing houses in the French Quarter and that all of its ties to the Mossad and the Bronfman family were just insignificant details of no consequence. Reitzes then proceeded to engage in a remarkable exercise in prevarication in which he then blinded his readers with a detailed exposition in which he summarized a number of varying reports about international financial transact ions involving Permindex. In his review and elsewhere in discussing Permindex on the Internet, Dave cited a variety of sources that have alleged differing amounts of money ($100,000 or $200,000) reportedly transferred between Permindex accounts and a numbe r of other entities including the Israel - based Bank Hapoalim. While the microanalysis undertaken by Reitzes may have proved one thing, that somebody somewhere typed the \"1\" key on their typewriter when he or she should have typed the \"2\" key when writing a bout the money transfers, Reitzes failed to refute the fact that Permindex was indeed part of the global arms and money laundering operations of the Mossad. Dave actually got a little desperate at one point when he took issue with my suggestion that it was \"well known\" that the Bank Hapoalim (referenced in Final Judgment) was associated with Israel's labor bund, the Histadrut. Perhaps it is not \"well known\" to the man of the street, but Reitzes knows full well that anyone with even a modicum of research ski lls can easily document that quite innocent fact — although the fact loses its innocence when one starts examining the multiple Israeli Mossad connections to the circles surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans the summer prior to the assassination of Jo hn F. Kennedy. CLAY SHAW — MORE MOSSAD THAN CIA . . . As I told Reitzes in response: \"The bottom line is that a better case can be made for Clay Shaw being a Mossad asset in 1963 than can be made for him being a CIA asset in that same year. You keep citing CIA documents that say that the CIA cut off relations with Shaw, but,\" I added, \"you can't cite any Mossad documents, can you.\" \"In short,\" I told the readers of my response, \"while Dave says that nobody can provide that Clay Shaw had CIA connections in 1 963, Dave cannot also prove that Clay Shaw didn't have Mossad contacts in 1963 unless he brings forth Mossad documents which say that 'We have no contacts with Clay Shaw,' (as though they would be available anyway).\" This brings up another point: Reitzes i s adamant in defending not only Clay Shaw, but also Guy Banister and David Ferrie (also of New Orleans) of any role whatsoever in the JFK affair, despite a wealth of information (that Reitzes dismisses arbitrarily) that these three were indeed connected no t only to each other but to the web of intrigue surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald that fateful summer."},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"697 Final Word? [599] AGAIN — TINY LITTLE DEFENSELESS ISRAEL . . . The big payoff came when Reitzes really dropped the ball, in the same fashion that the aforementioned Robert Ha rris had done earlier. In response to my post to Reitzes that \"No matter how far you succeed in discrediting Garrison and clearing Clay Shaw (and even Permindex), you can't get away from the fact that Israel had the motive and the means and that the key CI A player in the assassination and cover was the Mossad's man at the CIA,\" (referring to James J. Angleton), Reitzes responded: \"This is garbage. Even if Israel had 'the motive,' it would have been risking utter annihilation at the hands of the US should it s role be exposed.\" At another juncture Reitzes said, \"This is complete and utter nonsense. Little countries living in precarious situations do not work to assassinate leaders of world superpowers . . . Israel would have had no such excuse. You don't kill the progressive leader of a world superpower that is one of your greatest political allies. Period.\" I told Reitzes: \"Now, Dave, is where you have actually fallen through the thin ice. I didn't think it would happen. But you have actually now started tryi ng to discredit the possibility of Israel involvement.\" Prior to that Reitzes had not actually attempted to refute Israeli involvement. His approach had simply been to vindicate Clay Shaw and to suggest that Shaw's association with Permindex had nothing to do with either the JFK assassination of any kind of intelligence intrigue. Remarkably, Reitzes even made the assertion that \"Angleton, meanwhile, could hardly be less relevant to Piper's scenario. How does he figure in?\" disregarding the thoroughly - docume nted fact that Angleton was indeed a key player in, at the very least, the Warren Commission cover - up! I continued, telling Reitzes: \"You have reached as far as you can logically reach and say that Israel was such a small tiny country that it would have ne ver done such a nasty thing . . . Now you're displaying some weakness to the entire Internet world. Israel knew that it could carry off the JFK thing (with the help of the CIA), just as the CIA knew it could pull the thing off with the help of Israel, prec isely because an old CIA - Mossad ally, LBJ, was going to take care of things.\" DEBATING WHAT THE BOOK DOESN'T SAY Dave did fall through the ice. He finished off his review with suggestions that \"Piper is more comfortable discussing the possible connection s to the JFK assassination of UFOs, Masons, the British Crown, the Gemstone Files and the death of Marilyn Monroe.\" This, of course, would sound quite damning to most Internet readers of the Reitzes review who had not read Final Judgment, but the fact is t hat in Final Judgment I refuted four of those theories, and in the case of Marilyn Monroe (who actually died a year before JFK) I only reported the allegation that Israeli - linked Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen had orchestrated her death. So what Reitzes was doing was trying to distract the readers of his"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"[600] Final Judgment 698 review from what I really do say about the JFK assassination and trying to lead them to believe that I think, perhaps, that the Martians killed JFK. In the end, although he had managed to restrain hims elf quite admirably, Dave finally couldn't resist himself. After having engaged in some serious debate — at first — he finally started posting a variety of material attacking the political views of my employer, rather than addressing the specifics in my book. A REASONABLE CRITIQUE . . . I would be remiss in not mentioning the extended review of Final Judgment posted in several parts on the Internet by Clark Wilkins. His review was objective in the best sense of the word and while he never concluded that he ag reed with my thesis, he did remark at one juncture that \"A novice could walk away believing Piper had proved his case against Israel.\" And this, of course, is precisely what upsets the Israeli lobby. Wilkins did raise the very good question as to why the Israeli arms dealer, Arnon Milchan, would finance Oliver Stone's film, JFK , which resulted in raising \"public awareness and suspicion\" about the JFK assassination if the Mossad were indeed involved in the JFK assassination, commenting, \"I would think they would be willing to let sleeping dogs lie.\" I responded, however, that \"My feeling is that the film JFK was designed to give the public a 'consensus' about the assassination — kind of a vague consensus — and that it functioned as a release valve for all of the researchers to finally see a 'big theory' put on the screen.\" Wilkins apparently views the JFK assassination conspiracy as a scenario dictated more by money than politics, evidenced by his comment that \"Muddying up the waters even further, and a point avoided entirely by Piper, is that this powerful movement is not powered by politics. It's powered by money. Politics is simply steering it . . . Piper has grabbed the tiger by the tail and I can see why he's been bit. He has ventured where few would dare to tread.\" About Mossad figure Tibor Rosenbaum, Wilkins made the thoughtful comment: \"Tibor Rosenbaum is not a criminal. He's not a Mafia man. In terms of our understanding he's like Benjamin Franklin when Franklin went to France in search of military supp ort against the British. Rosenbaum, like Franklin, went out in search of aid for Israel to obtain military support against the Arabs — and, like Franklin — he succeeded . . . This guy is a hero in Israel and he deserves to be.\" Wilkins added the cautionary not e, however, that \"What nobody knows, or at least what nobody talks about, is how Rosenbaum got the money.\" By the time Wilkins had read about one fourth of Final Judgment , he commented, in response to allegations that the book was anti - Semitic: \"At this po int Piper still has not convinced me of a conspiracy involving Israel or the Mossad. Even if the book fails in its premise, however, it will have convinced me of something else: and that is the enormous power the charge"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"699 Final Word? [601] of anti - Semitism holds in America that it can inspire so much outrage against a book that is really written like any other.\" Wilkins noted that \"I witnessed it take place on this news group. The moment the subject of his book came up, charges of anti - Semitism followed along with the argume nt/claim/whatever that he is some kind of Holocaust revisionist. Piper describes this very attempt to discredit him in his book with uncomfortable accuracy.\" Clark Wilkins never came around to endorsing my thesis of Mossad involvement in the JFK assassinat ion conspiracy, but, at the very least, he acknowledged that the ever - controversial Permindex entity was indeed linked to the operations of the Mossad and Israel's international intrigue — and that's much further than many people will go. In that context, ad dressing one of my critics, James Olmstead, who has said that Final Judgment was based solely on what Olmstead described as my \"hate for the state of Israel,\" Wilkins commented \"You'll find Piper has it right. I know you think he's Darth Vader but he does do his homework.\" Thanks to Clark Wilkins for an honest, sincere effort to find out the truth, wherever it may lead. SOME FRIENDLY REVIEWS . . . All of the foregoing is not to suggest that the reviews of Final Judgment have been uniformly suspicious or h ostile. Quite the contrary. We've already noted the very positive review from Israeli journalist Barry Chamish. In fact, in addition, there have been several friendly reviews that have appeared in a number of places, and they're worth noting. One of those reviews appeared in Psychotropedia: A Guide to Publications on the Periphery, a compendium of \"alternative\" and \"underground\" books and literature that are often difficult to find in the so - called \"mainstream.\" Edited by Russ Kick, Psychotropedia was publi shed in book form by Headpress/Critical Vision of Manchester, England in 1998 and included this eminently fair review which reads as follows: Final Judgment is a JFK conspiracy book that you will probably never see mentioned, even by other assassination r esearchers. Michael Piper's thesis is that Israel — specifically its intelligence agency, the Mossad — orchestrated Kennedy's assassination. Piper is a longtime employee of the Liberty Lobby, a very conservative, populist organization which publishes the weekl y newspaper, The Spotlight . Its critics say that Liberty Lobby is anti - Semitic, but it says that it is simply highly critical of Israel. I mention this as background information, not to take sides on the issue. You can decide for yourself."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"[602] Final Judgment 700 Yet another Internet review of Final Judgment came from quite an interesting source: Daniel Brandt, a veteran and well - known figure of the so - called \"New Left\" movement of the 1960s. In more recent times, Mr. Brandt has been associated with the newsletter NameBase New sline and with Public Interest Research, which categorizes and computerizes a master index of published material of interest to researchers looking into subjects such as military and intelligence, political history, etc. The review of Final Judgment reads as follows (in its entirety): Just as our two - year subscription to Liberty Lobby's Spotlight newspaper was winding down, along comes this book by Spotlight writer Michael Collins Piper. We clipped a fair number of their investigative articles for NameBase during that period, and no longer felt defensive when our leftist critics condemned Spotlight as anti - Semitic. The rare instances of excessive anti - Zionist zeal in Spotlight are more than offset by their consistently credible reporting on other issues. Wh en we saw the advance publicity for Final Judgment, which claimed that this book would offer \"astounding proof\" that Mossad had a hand in the JFK assassination, we were a bit nervous. As it turns o u t , t h e M o s s a d l i n k s p r e s e n t e d b y P i p e r a r e circumstantial rather than conclusive, but definitely worth considering. Other aspects of the JFK morass that Piper discusses, such as the Mafia - CIA - Israeli connection (starring Meyer Lansky and James Angleton), Charles DeGaulle and his problems with the OAS, and the sp ooky business of Permindex, are rarely treated in other JFK literature. S o w e w e r e h a p p y t o i n c l u d e t h i s b o o k i n NameBase, particularly since it doesn't have an index of its own. [Note: the first and second editions of Final Judgment were not indexed. Su bsequent editions are indexed.] The very fact that Mr. Brandt (who comes from the so - called political \"left\") has written what is obviously and fair and open - minded review is interesting in itself and cinforms precisely what I have said from the beginning: that Final Judgment does not have any \"right wing\" thesis or orientation whatsoever. The most recently published review of Final Judgment appears in Amok Fifth Dispatch: Sourcebook of the Extremes of Information (Los Angeles, Amok Books, 1999). Edited by Stuart Swezey, Amok describes itself as a guide to \"the most bizarre, controversial and thought - provoking"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"701 Final Word? [603] books available from hundreds of publishers worldwide.\" The Amok review of Final Judgment reads as follows in its entirety: This book offers even th e most grizzled devotees of mayhem and mystery more than enough meat to chew on. In this strange twist of events, the focus shifts to Israel's role in the assassination of JFK. The author walks the reader straight into the domain of Meyer Lansky, Mickey Co hen, and the Mossad, maintaining that Israel and its secret service had a reason to be opposed to JFK; and that Israel's allies in the mob and the CIA were, in turn, interacting with one another and opposed to JFK; thus these forces were allied together in the JFK conspiracy. So although there are those who will continue to smear me and to attack Final Judgment for their own purposes, there are a few brave souls out there who are willing to say that the book has more merits than some of my critics might be willing to admit. I appreciate that. THE GARRISON SMEAR CONTINUES . . . Since the release of Oliver Stone's JFK (which gave new life to widespread public interest in JFK assassination conspiracy theories), there has been a renewed effort to discredit al l JFK assassination conspiracies which point toward involvement by the CIA — and Jim Garrison's investigation in particular. The most notable book - length effort to discredit Garrison came with the publication in 1998 of Patricia Lambert's False Witness which is largely dedicated to the proposition that Jim Garrison was a reckless madman and that Clay Shaw was just an innocent socialite who fell prey to a dangerous demagogue. Although there have been many notable critiques of Lambert's book, the one published in The Baltimore Sun on March 14, 1999 by Joan Mellen — the author of 12 books and a teacher in the creative writing program of Temple University — summarizes Lambert's work best, saying book \"twists the facts, suppresses an enormous amount of material, and of fers so distorted a picture as to render it of scant historical merit.\" Ms. Mellen also points out that although Lambert's book jacket describes her as a \"writer/editor\" not a single book, magazine or newspaper article written by Lambert is ever cited. It would take another book to deal with many of Miss Lambert's prevarications, but her most memorable is worth citing here. In her effort to refute the fact that Clay Shaw was indeed a CIA asset, Lambert engaged in a rather remarkable series of twists and tur ns on pages 204 and 205 of her book to try and explain away the CIA's own records which document"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"[604] Final Judgment 702 Shaw's longtime ties to the CIA. Lambert's amazing contortion reads as follows (with emphasis added): \"Still, the full extent of [Shaw's] association with the agency is for now unclear. Clouding the issue is a CIA project from the 1960s known as QK/ENCHANT. The CIA apparently approved Shaw (perhaps without his knowledge) for this project, which, by one unofficial account, was nothing more than a program for routine debriefing of individuals involved in i n t e r n a t i o n a l t r a d e . A t t h i s p o i n t , w h a t QK/ENCHANT actually was, whether or not it ever came to fruition, and what, if anything, Shaw knew about it, also remain unknown. But Shaw's work for the CIA, whatever i t was, is irrelevant. Since Garrison never connected him to the assassination, linking him to the CIA meant nothing thirty years ago, and it means nothing today.\" Note the wordplay: \"the full extent . . . is for now unclear . . . clouding . . . apparently . . . perhaps . . . by one unofficial account . . . whether or not . . also remain unknown . . . whatever it was.\" Then Lambert tells us that since (in her judgment) Garrison failed to connect Shaw to the assassination, Shaw's CIA link meant nothing anywa y. Lambert herself unwittingly reveals that Shaw wasn't simply just another American businessman who had a brief association with the CIA as part of his international travels. On page 325 of her book Lambert points out that CIA documents themselves reveal that Shaw was first contacted by the CIA in 1948 and was contacted by the CIA a total of thirty times over the next eight years. Lambert expects us to assume that all of the CIA documents that she cites are the only CIA documents relative to the work that Shaw performed for the agency — a leap of faith indeed. Despite all this, Miss Lambert (of course) does not address the possibility that Shaw was also, during the same time frame, working in concert with Israel's Mossad. Miss Lambert cites no Mossad document s one way or the other in that regard. But the fact is that we do know that Shaw was indeed closely associated with the Mossad through Permindex. On page 285 of her book Lambert adds that: \"There is no evidence that Shaw's connection with [Permindex was] p art of a secret life as a high - level international intelligence agent. . . Shaw certainly made no effort to keep his association with the group a secret: in 1962 he listed it in the biographical information published in Who's Who. Had he been aware of the group's intelligence connection, it seems unlikely that he would have done that.\" This, of course, presupposes, first of all, that Shaw knew in 1962 that Permindex would play a part in the JFK assassination in 1963 and that, in fact, Permindex would be lin ked to the crime. After all, it wasn't the intent"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"703 Final Word? [605] of the conspirators to have either Shaw — or Permindex — connected to the JFK assassination conspiracy. But that doesn't mean much to Lambert. Not surprisingly, Lambert also goes to extraordinary efforts to r efute the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald had any association with CIA contract operative David Ferrie. On page 61 of her book she describes a photo of Oswald and Ferrie together at a Civil Air Patrol cookout as something that \"established only an overlap of a ssociation with that organization\" — another remarkable linguistic prevarication indeed. However, as a consequence of a wide variety of long - standing research, coupled with new findings by independent film producer Daniel Hopsicker (referenced in Appendix Th ree), we know for a fact that Oswald and Ferrie were closely associated. Lambert also claims that there is no \"credible\" testimony placing Oswald in association with CIA contract agent Guy Banister. Her use of the term \"credible\" is just another way of say ing those — including Banister's own mistress, Delphine Roberts, and her daughter, among others — who did testify to Oswald's association with Banister just simply can't be believed. In the end, the Lambert book just simply can't be believed. ALL NEW DISINFOR MATION, CIA - MOSSAD STYLE The worldwide media has given great play to the release of a new book that purported to \"prove\" that it was the Soviet KGB that concocted the story that the CIA was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The book purported t o be the inside history of the KGB's secret intelligence operations in the U.S. and Europe The Sword and the Shield by Professor Christopher Andrew of Cambridge — described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on intelligence history,\" — is said to be ba sed on what are said to be extensive notes and transcriptions (secretly compiled over a 12 year period) of vast numbers of files from the KGB archives. The notes themselves were supposedly smuggled out of KGB headquarters and then to Britain. According to Andrew, his book is an annotated and supplemented summary of the files as they were provided by former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin who retired from the KGB in 1984 and who then defected to Britain in 1992 after the CIA had rejected Mitrokhin. Mitrokhin reportedly smuggled his notes drawn from the KGB files out of the KGB office in his shoes and pockets and then buried them — until his defection — under the floorboards of his country home. However, even The Washington Post, which seldom criticizes the CIA or British intelligence, featured a review of the Andrew book on December 6, 1999, by veteran intelligence critic David Wise, who comments that: \"A book sponsored by an intelligence agency must be approached with caution.\" One major problem with the Andrew bo ok is that while it is quite thoroughly footnoted, with hundreds of references to a wide - ranging amount of material, it is not always clear (actually, more often than not) whether Andrew is purporting to cite the Mitrokhin archives as his source or"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"[606] Final Judgment 704 wheth er the information he is presenting is Andrew's own interpretation, based on the material of others. In that sense, then, while the book is quite skillfully written in such a way that it appears to present the information presented as having come from the KGB's supposedly purloined file, that is not always necessarily the case. So the reader should thus be warned. It appears Andrew's book is presenting the Mitrokhin archives as some sort of effort to counter new official histories of the KGB that are being released by the KGB's post - Soviet era successor, the SVR. For example, Andrew lashes out at Lolly Zamoysky, the SVR's literary editor of the new multi - volume official history, as having been \"well known\" in the KGB \"for his belief in a global Masonic - Zioni st plot\" and for having previously published a 1989 book entitled Behind the Facade of the Masonic Temple \"which blamed the Freemasons for the outbreak of the Cold War.\" According to Andrew, Zamoysky claimed that \"Freemasons have always controlled the uppe r echelons of government in Western countries . . . Masonry in fact runs, 'remotely controls' bourgeois society . . . The true center of the world Masonic movement is to be found in the most \"Masonic' country of all, the United States . . . .\" Thus, Andrew 's book is effectively an attempt to counter allegations of high - level Zionist intrigue that has been documented by the official post - KGB Russian intelligence services. WHERE'S ANGLETON? WHERE'S ISRAEL? In that regard, it is quite remarkable to note that in the entirety of this extensively documented and indexed 700 - page volume, there is only one indexed reference to Israel and not a single indexed reference to the Mossad, this despite the widely - known fact that the Mossad played a central role alongside the CIA in its operations in Western Europe throughout the period that Andrew has purported to describe, based on Mitrochin's files. Likewise, in the same vein, there are only two indexed references to the CIA's longtime counterintelligence chief, James Je sus Angleton. This is interesting — very interesting — since Angleton, who is best remembered for his strident anti - Soviet stance, having spent decades looking for a \"KGB mole\" in the upper echelons of the CIA and for KGB moles in allied Western intelligence a gencies — was also a devoted Israeli loyalist who jealously guarded his role as the CIA's liaison to the Mossad. Yet, despite all this, Andrew's passing references to Angleton refer to subject matter that has appeared in dozens, if not hundreds, of other boo ks on the subject of intelligence intrigue. Somehow, some way the role of the Mossad and its CIA ally, Angleton, have slipped through the memory hole in this otherwise massive account of KGB intrigue that — if the official histories would correctly have us b elieve — were under the direct purview of Angleton's day - to - day counterintelligence operations at the CIA. Perhaps the most glaring evidence of outright fraud, per se, in the Andrew - Mitrokhin production is the flimsy and quite transparent attempt to absolve the CIA of any involvement in the assassination of John F."},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"705 Final Word? [607] Kennedy and, at the same time, make it appear as though so - called \"theories\" linking the CIA to the crime were exclusively disinformation put forth by the KGB. In fact, when the news of Andrew's book was first announced in the major media, most reports focused — sometimes exclusively — on the purported revelation that it was actually the KGB that was behind the theory that the CIA was involved in the president's murder. Most people who read news accou nts of the release of the book would probably have gleaned little more than that, based on the nature of the news reports in question. Andrew's book claimed that KGB data purloined by Mitrokhin revealed that a letter — supposedly written prior to the assassi nation by JFK's accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, and addressed to a \"Mr. Hunt\" (presumably the CIA's E. Howard Hunt) — was actually a KGB forgery. According to Andrew, the letter was fabricated in the mid - 1970s after Hunt's name came to widespread public attention over his involvement in the Watergate scandal and then sent out to independent researchers who were looking into the JFK assassination. As part of this effort to vindicate the CIA, hinging on the story of the purported KGB forgery, Andrew spends a great deal of energy spinning a literary web around the charge that pioneer JFK assassination investigator Mark Lane was either a witting or unwitting tool of the KGB in his writing of Rush to Judgment, Lane's ground - breaking critique of the Warren Comm ission Report on the assassination of President Kennedy. Andrew connects Lane to the theory that \"the CIA killed JFK\" but fails to advise his readers that never once in Rush to Judgment did Lane ever allege that the CIA was involved in the president's assa ssination. And Lane's book never once, in any way, shape or form, referred to the apparently forged \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter so widely heralded in the press coverage of Andrew's book.. While Lane's thesis about CIA involvement was outlined in his much later - written 1993 book, Plausible Denial, based in part on the information that came out during Lane's defense in 1985 of The Spotlight newspaper against a libel suit filed by E. Howard Hunt, he \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter played no part in the scenario outlined in Plausible Denial either. In addition, in Plausible Denial, Lane develops solid evidence demonstrating that the CIA itself fabricated a scenario linking Oswald to a KGB officer in Mexico. Since this CIA operation actually took place more than a month before P r e s i d e n t K e n n e d y w a s k i l l e d , t h i s e v i d e n c e — s t a n d i n g alone — demonstrates behind question that the CIA was involved not just in the post - assassination cover - up, but in the planning of the crime itself and in the framing of the patsy. Needless to say, Andrew addresses none of this. In fact, the \"Dear Mr. Hunt\" letter was indeed most likely a forgery but the question remains as to \"who\" concocted the forgery, Christopher Andrew's claims notwithstanding. Andrew, of course, contends that the KGB was responsible, but in Final Judgment I very clearly suggest that the letter was a forgery and that"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"[608] Final Judgment 706 the evidence actually points to high - ranking CIA official James J. Angleton as having been the likely perpetrator, noting that Angleton also played a major part in the l eaking (around the same period) of what was purported to be an in - house CIA memorandum suggesting that Hunt was in Dallas on the day of the president's murder. All of this perhaps explains why Andrew is so determined to suppress the facts by targeting Mark Lane who singularly did so much to bring out the truth about the CIA's complicity. Andrew actually makes the flat - out allegation that Lane received funding from the KGB at the time he was writing Rush to Judgment, thereby leaving readers to conclude that Lane's own work was essentially part of a KGB disinformation effort. Yet, at the same time, buried in the massive footnote section of the book, Andrew himself acknowledges that when Lane supposedly received a paltry $1,500 from the KGB's New York office th at \"there is no evidence that Lane did realize the source of the funding\" although, in the text of the book itself, Andrew contends that the KGB \"suspected that he might have guessed where it came from.\" In fact, Lane never once received any substantial co ntribution of this size from anyone at any time in relation to his work on the JFK assassination. His largest contribution at the time was a one - time donation of $50 from famed comic Woody Allen. Andrew claims that \"the same intermediary\" paid $500 for a trip that Lane made to Europe in 1964. This is not true. In addition, Andrew claims that while in Europe Lane made an attempt to visit Moscow to discuss his JFK findings. Again, not true. During that trip Lane actually took an outspoken stand against Sovie t censorship and human rights violations during a visit to Bulgaria, where he had been invited to speak at an international conference of attorneys. Lane so offended his hosts by his anti - Soviet remarks that they advised him that his best option was to get out of the country immediately — hardly advice reserved for someone favored by the KGB. What is most telling about the obvious disinformation campaign against Lane by Andrew (worthy of the KGB's best) is the very fact that not a single one of Lane's books ( on the JFK assassination or any other subject) was ever translated and published under Soviet sponsorship. Literally dozens of American authors have received vast profits from Soviet - sponsored publications of their books behind the former Iron Curtain — but not Mark Lane. If the Soviets had genuinely been interested in advancing Lane's efforts they could have openly published any of Lane's seven books (two of which have been best - sellers) just as they have published other books, without even an eyebrow raised . Yet Christopher Andrew has made patently false allegations about Lane's supposed \"KGB connection.\" The allegations are a deliberate attempt to sully Lane's reputation and an attempt to refute evidence of CIA complicity in the assassination of President K ennedy."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"707 Final Word? [609] As such, it is not unfair to note that Andrew's own teaching and lecturing has, in fact, been subsidized in part by the CIA, a fact that Andrew's biography on his book's dust jacket fails to note, but which is mentioned in glowing terms in promot ional materials that have been distributed by his publisher. The motivations of Andrew (and his ties to the intelligence community) must certainly raise eyebrows considering just the items that we've considered here. DIRTY TRICKS DELIGHT On Dec. 21, 1998 the ADL issued a press release (which was also published on the Internet) attacking a group known as the Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC). The ADL press release noted that I spoke at the meeting of the national capital chapter of the CCC in the Wash ington, D.C. area and went on to charge that I made \"anti - Semitic comments\" in my address (which, by the way, is just not true). In any event, here are the facts: On December 12, 1998 I was invited to speak at a public forum held in Arlington, Virginia spo nsored by the CCC. I had no previous association with the CCC, then or afterword. Shortly thereafter, however, the CCC won national headlines because several Republican members of Congress had addressed the group as well and the group was called \"racist\" b y its critics. The truth is that the CCC, in my estimation, is obsessed with racial issues, but that wasn't the topic of my speech to the CCC, any more than I had planned to talk about \"the Holocaust\" when the ADL used that issue to scuttle my proposed spe aking engagement in California in the fall of 1997. My position is that I will speak to any group that will invite me. In any event, when I spoke before the CCC, a \"fact finder\" for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) — which is allied with the ADL — was in attendance (under cover) at the gathering and soon afterword the SPLC published a report on the event which included the following comments about my performance that day: Next up is Michael Collins Piper, a correspondent for the anti - Semitic Spotlight ta bloid who explains that Israel was actually behind the Kennedy assassination. Piper gets progressively angrier as he talks about the J e w s h e s a y s c o n t r o l H o l l y w o o d . . . P i p e r i s accompanied by a black bodyguard, a member of the black supremacist Nation of Islam, who sits quietly in the back, his eyes and identity shielded by dark sunglasses. Piper instructs his audience that he is not anti - black, gesturing towards his bodyguard, who obligingly smiles and nods at the appropriate moment. He is the only perso n of color present . . . Piper ends with a comment on how sick he is of hearing about the Holocaust and how he just doesn't care how many Jews died."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"[610] Final Judgment 708 When I called the SPLC and then wrote them a letter advising them that they had published several absolute lies about my actions and words that day, I can assure you that they were particularly unnerved to learn that I had a videotape of the event that proved what liars they were. First of all, my bodyguard — my African - American friend — was not and never was a member of the Nation of Islam and neither I nor he ever said he was. In fact, my bodyguard was the father of a little boy who just happens to be my godson. Secondly, although my bodyguard did wear sunglasses, it was because he happens to have a chron ic sleep which has made his eyes vulnerable to bright lights. Thirdly, I never \"instructed\" the audience that I was \"not anti - black.\" In fact, it was another person at the meeting who used those words and gestured to my bodyguard. It wasn't me at all. Howe ver, the SPLC led its readers to believe my bodyguard was some sort of \"Step - N - Fetchit\" who leered to the audience like a simple - minded Uncle Tom. Finally, I did not grow progressively angrier as I spoke about \"the Jews who control Hollywood.\" In fact, I d idn't really discuss the subject at all. As the videotape of the event demonstrates, I did grow progressively angrier as I discussed how self - styled JFK assassination researchers had tried to suppress my book. However, when a member of the audience did mak e a comment about Jewish influence in Hollywood, I passed by the comment, remarking with a laugh, \"You said that. I didn't.\" Perhaps not by coincidence, the person who made the comment about Jewish influence in Hollywood emerged later as an informant for t he SPLC and the FBI. However, the SPLC report was later posted on the Internet — for the entire world to see — not only by the SPLC, but also by other parties who had an interest in defaming me. What is interesting is that once I dared to challenge the SPLC wi th the facts they quickly amended their allegations. Quite rightly, the SPLC feared what would have been the obvious circus that would have erupted had my bodyguard taken them to court in Washington, D.C. where this self - styled \"anti - racist\" group would be forced to explain to what would almost certainly be a majority Black jury why they had maliciously abused an innocent African - American whose sole crime was to act as a bodyguard for his friend (the godfather of his infant son) who had previously been thre atened by the Jewish Defense League. What is particularly intriguing about this CCC event so falsely memorialized by the SPLC is that one of the CCC's national leaders, Jared Taylor, actually boycotted the event, evidently offended by my suggestions that I srael and the CIA had done something unpleasant. This didn't surprise me. In late August of 1993, I had been told by one of Taylor's friends, Theodore J. O'Keefe, that once when he was visiting Mr. Taylor and his wife at their home, the Taylors received a call from Irwin Suall, then the \"fact finding\" director for the ADL. The average CCC member should wonder why Taylor was receiving calls at his home from the ADL, which otherwise trashes the average CCC member. To sum it up: it appears to me that although the ADL does traffic behind the scenes with people perceived to be \"racists,\" the ADL doesn't"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"709 Final Word? [611] really mind them being \"racist\" as long as they support the ADL's propaganda line as far as Israel is concerned. Perhaps the ADL (which also opposes affirmative action, just like the CCC) has a bigger agenda at work. After all, it's been known for years that the FBI permitted its Ku Klux Klan informants to engage in anti - Black behavior, but there was, at the same time, a long - standing order that they could not cr iticize Jews or Israel. So that is very telling indeed. Anyway, when the CCC's newspaper published a very brief review of Final Judgment, the newspaper never once mentioned the fact that the book links the Mossad to the JFK assassination, only hinting dark ly about \"other agencies\" aside from the Lansky syndicate that may have been involved. Now here's the punchline: I've since learned that the CCC organizer who set up the meeting where I spoke was almost certainly some sort of intelligence operative — probab ly working for British intelligence — so that raises questions about why I was invited to speak in the first place. THE CURRENT MEDIA TWIST The way the media has reported on the JFK case in recent years is illustrated well by two similar reports published in the \"conservative\" Washington Times on June 5, 1998 and the next day in the Times' \"liberal\" counterpart in the nation's capital, the Washington Post. The Times story, entitled \"Garrison idea on accomplice was rejected by Oswald widow,\" was written by longtime Warren Commission enthusiast Hugh Aynesworth, now working for the Times. The story reported that a 79 - page transcript of Mrs. Oswald's testimony in 1968 before a grand jury convened by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison had just been relea sed by the Assassinations Records Review Board in Washington and that the transcript revealed that Mrs. Oswald believed that her husband acted alone in the assassination. T he next day, on June 6, 1998, the Washington Post reported essentially the same stor y under the headline, \"Oswald's Widow Rejected Conspiracy, Papers Show.\" The casual reader would conclude that Mrs. Oswald accepted the Warren Commission's claim that her husband was indeed JFK's assassin and that he acted alone. Of the two newspaper accou nts, however, the Post report was technically the more honest. The concluding paragraph of the Post report let the cat out of the bag: \"Over the years, however, she changed her mind about Oswald's guilt, eventually accepting conspiracy theories.\" During th at same time frame, Parade magazine piped in with the old saw that organized crime was responsible for the JFK assassination. A press release dated June 4, 1998 from Parade announced that \"Bobby Kennedy Believed the Mob Killed JFK,\" citing longtime RFK ass ociate Jack Newfield as the source. Newfield, it will be recalled, penned the January 14, 1992 article in The New York Post (illustrated in the photo section of Final Judgment) hyping"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"[612] Final Judgment 710 the highly unlikely story that Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa had used his \"Mafia\" connections to arrange the JFK assassination. That Parade joined the cover - up parade is no surprise. The Sunday supplement is a media voice of the powerful Newhouse family (headed by S. I. \"Si\" Newhouse) and said by society writer Stephen Birmingh am to be the second wealthiest Jewish family in America. In its March/April 1995 issue, the now - defunct Spy magazine published an intriguing article entitled \"Spy Uncovers the Kennedy - Newhouse Connection,\" written by New York attorney John Klotz. The artic le read in part: Does Si Newhouse have culpable knowledge of the Kennedy assassination? For more than 30 years Newhouse and his media empire have played a unique role in the controversy surrounding events at Dealey Plaza . . . An inquiry into the assassin ation of Bobby Kennedy was curiously sidetracked by the Newhouse empire. In The Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the authors present convincing evidence of a conspiracy. According to co - author and former FBI agent William Turner, after the book's publis her, Random House, was acquired by Newhouse, the company took aggressive action to withdraw its publication . . . More recently, Random House published Case Closed, which supports the Warren Commission's theory that Oswald acted alone. Given author Gerald Posner's reliance on \"confidential intelligence sources,\" some have suggested that Case Closed is typical CIA - friendly propaganda. Finally, this June [1995] Random House is scheduled to release a new book by Norman Mailer, in which he is expected to retrac t his oft - stated belief that a conspiracy killed JFK. According to Newhouse biographer Thomas Maier, the man who initially introduced Mailer to Newhouse and Random House was Roy Cohn. What has driven Newhouse's devotion to Kennedy cover - ups? The questions should be asked: What does Si Newhouse know and when did he know it?\" In fact, Newhouse's \"devotion to Kennedy cover - ups\" may have been stimulated by his lifelong friendship with the aforementioned Roy Cohn, whom, as we noted earlier, was a corporate inve stor in the Mossad's Permindex operation. And we would be remiss in failing to note that it was a Newhouse newspaper — The New Orleans Times - Picayune — that dominated the daily"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"711 Final Word? [613] press in Permindex board member Clay Shaw's hometown, calling for Jim Garrison's head on a platter when the Crescent City district attorney failed to convict Shaw for his role in the JFK assassination conspiracy. So that the Newhouse press would rush to put forth Jack Newfield's latest spin on the theory that \"The Mafia Killed JFK,\" su ggesting that this was Robert Kennedy's view, is no surprise. Newfield has also emerged as one of the voices promoting the idea that the Kennedy brothers were enamored with Israel. Just as Parade was hyping Newfield's \"Bobby and the Mafia\" twist, the Jewis h Bulletin of Northern California published an article on May 29, 1998 proclaiming that \"Pro - Semitic' RFK Overcame Upbringing, Writer Says.\" The article quoted Newfield saying that JFK' s assassination so affected RFK that \"he came to identify with anybody else who was hurt or wounded or grieving in any way . . . [and that RFK] had a special place in his heart for Jews and Israel . . . Bobby overtime became very pro - Semitic and went out of his way to surround himself with Jews.\" Self - described former Mossad operative David Heymann, in his critical biography of RFK, had a different spin, reporting that \"A number of people accused RFK of using [anti - Semitic] terminology when privately discussing Jews. According to Truman Capote, 'He often referred to Jews as e ither 'kikes' or 'yids.'\" According to one of my own sources, who maintained a close working relationship with an intimate Kennedy family friend and political crony, RFK was known when discussing Jews in restaurants and other places where he might be overh eard to refer to Jews as \"the liberals.\" What all of this suggests, in any event, is that there is now a concerted media effort — since the release of Final Judgment and growing knowledge of its revelations concerning the difficult relationship between JFK a nd Israel — to portray the Kennedy brothers as devout Zionists, when nothing could be further from the truth. This propaganda campaign reached its most outlandish when on June 3, 1998 during a week - long 50th anniversary celebration of the birth of Israel hel d at Union Station in Washington, D.C. there was a special program: \"Remembering Robert Kennedy,\" sponsored by the Anti - Defamation League. The program noted that \"This event is a tribute to the strong bond between the Kennedy family and the State of Israel .\" One is tempted to laugh at the chutzpah and the revisionist history at work here, but it is clear that the facts about the Kennedy family and Israel are most uncomfortable for Israel indeed. THOSE AWFUL KENNEDY BOYS . . . At the same time, the media i s promoting a new twist on the Kennedy assassination itself, suggesting that Jack and Bobby Kennedy were basically responsible for their own assassinations for having dared to engage in CIA intrigue against Castro and others during the JFK administration. The"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"[614] Final Judgment 712 Kennedy family is also being blamed for having had a part in stimulating JFK - related conspiracy theories in the wake of the assassination. In on Oct. 12, 1998 opinion piece in Newsweek, the CIA's favorite JFK conspiracy debunker, Gerald Posner, decla red that \"the Kennedys may have inadvertently fed the conspiracy machine\" saying that the primary result of the release of thousands of JFK assassination documents by the Assassinations Records Review Board \"prove there was indeed a cover - up, but not of th e assassination.\" The cover - up, Posner says, was of the misdeeds of the Kennedy brothers prior to JFK's assassination. In a similar vein, Max Holland, author of a new (relatively favorable) history of the Warren Commission, propounded the idea in the Decem ber 6, 1998 issue of the Boston Sunday Globe that \"The CIA was no rogue elephant but rather President Kennedy's personal instrument, for good or ill, during the Cold War.\" The foremost book length work putting forth the theory that the manipulation of the CIA by the Kennedy brothers was ultimately responsible for the JFK assassination tragedy appeared in Gus Russo's 1998 volume, Live by The Sword. Russo's thesis — if it can be boiled down simply — is essentially this:   John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney G eneral Robert Kennedy, were bound and determined to kill Fidel Castro. The Kennedy brothers took complete control of the CIA and that agency became a virtual Kennedy family fiefdom, with Bobby himself acting as the assassin - in - chief responsible for the plo ts to kill Castro.   According to Russo, the CIA - connected anti - Castro elements in New Orleans surrounding Oswald's associate, David Ferrie, were actually working for Bobby Kennedy — a fascinating twist indeed!   In the meantime, lone nut Lee Harvey Oswald — who w as a committed disciple of Cuban dictator Castro and not, by any means, under the control of the CIA — was busy promoting Castro's cause.   Somewhere, somehow, Oswald the Marxist decided to become Oswald the Assassin. Whether Oswald was acting on behalf of Cas tro (or with the Cuban dictator's quiet assistance), Russo isn't quite certain.   Then, after JFK was killed, Bobby Kennedy and the CIA did everything to cover their tracks and hide the fact that Jack and Bobby Kennedy were plotting to kill Castro.   John Fost er Dulles — the CIA director fired by JFK after the Bay of Pigs fiasco — emerges in Russo's book as a decent chap whose primary interest in covering up the truth about the assassination was to protect his good friends Jack and Bobby Kennedy and their secret wa r against Fidel Castro. (This is not facetious. Russo paints Dulles as a Kennedy loyalist!)   As a result of all of that scurrying about by the CIA and the subsequent cover - up by the Warren Commission, according to Russo, JFK assassination conspiracy theoris ts went hog wild and assumed that the cover - up was an effort by the CIA to cover up its own complicity in the crime when, in fact, the CIA was actually trying to protect the Kennedys."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"713 Final Word? [615] Essentially, in Russo's view, Jack Kennedy lived by the sword and the refore died by the sword, thus the title of Russo's tangled fantasy. \"If presidents choose to live dangerously, as John F. Kennedy did,\" Russo concludes, \"it may cost them their lives.\" So, in the end, JFK got precisely what he deserved — or so Russo would l ike us to believe. And that is the ongoing propaganda line about JFK (and Bobby, too) to which we are now being treated in the rest of the \"mainstream media\" which so relishes the misdeeds of the Kennedy family. What is telling, though, about Russo's book, is that Russo seems to have been able to dredge up long - secret \"witnesses\" (particularly CIA officers and agents whose names remain anonymous) that somehow seem to have never been reached by any author before. And that, in itself, is reminiscent of that o ther esteemed Warren Commission defender, Gerald Posner. So we do have to wonder if Russo's book isn't really some carefully crafted CIA disinformation of the grandest sort. I do hasten to make one point about Russo's book, considering his claims that Bobb y (and Jack) Kennedy were actually the instigators of the anti - Castro machinations of David Ferrie and the other CIA assets circulating around Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleans: The one thing that Russo never addressed is the possibility that Bobby Kennedy himself may have orchestrated a provocation against Castro in the form of a \"dummy\" assassination attempt (ostensibly by \"pro - Castro agitator\" Lee Harvey Oswald) against his own brother (utilizing CIA assets that Russo says were working for Bobby) and that this \"dummy\" attempt may have been usurped by others — and I am referring to Mossad allies in the CIA such as James Angleton and Frank Sturgis — and in the end that \"dummy\" assassination may have been turned into the real thing. Considering everything that we have uncovered in the pages of Final Judgment that frightening scenario is not so very far out of the realm of possibility. So, in that sense, Bobby Kennedy may have had a real surprise on November 22, 1963. THE OFFICIAL LINE In any event, the war to de fend the Warren Commission Report has not yet come to an end. The opening gun in defense of this fraud was fired on November 22, 1964 when (as we noted in Appendix Four) The Washington Post published a glowing review of The Warren Commission Report accompa nied by negative reviews of several books critical of the report. The author was Eugene Rostow, then dean of the Yale Law School — and a prominent figure in the Israeli lobby — who wrote: The Report is a masterly and convincing state paper. It has the high po lish of legal writing at its best, carefully composed, terse, restrained and meticulous. In a detached and judicious tone, it deals with every feature of the case, discussing and evaluating the basis"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"[616] Final Judgment 714 for the conclusions the Commission reached, and thei r rejection of the various contrary theories which had been advanced. Despite all these lotions of love, neither The Washington Post nor Rostow mentioned was that it was Rostow himself who was the first person to suggest to President Johnson that such a c ommission as the Warren Commission be established! As noted previously, Rostow and the Post were able to get away with this fraud at the time, at least, for Rostow's pivotal role in the creation of the Warren Commission was not detailed in any substance un til many years after the JFK assassination. But it does say a lot about the way the press does promote the \"official\" line on the JFK assassination, particularly when we consider Rostow's high - level role in the Israeli lobby in America which does have such considerable influence on the American media. This is relevant here, for as we've pointed out, there has been a concerted effort by the Israeli lobby to suppress Final Judgment at the same time the major media in America have been determined — as far as is possible — not to give the thesis of this book any more airing than necessary. In fact, a recent controversy surrounding Final Judgment brought the book's thesis back into the mainstream, and it also bared a strenuous (although failed) effort to refute the t heory of the book itself. La AFFAIRE SCHAUMBURG For the first five months of the year 2000 the otherwise quiet Chicago suburb of Schaumburg was wracked by a stormy debate over censorship and freedom of speech and centered on Final Judgment, recalling the row that raged for over a year in Orange County, California (described in the foreword) after I was invited to speak about my book at a college seminar on he JFK assassination. The Schaumburg frenzy began in January when a local library patron, Christophe r Bollyn, was so impressed with the book that he tied to donate a copy to the Schaumburg Township District Library (STDL). He felt the book would be an admirable addition to the library which already had multiple copies of a Gerald Posner's widely - promoted book which says there was \"no conspiracy\" and which echoes the Warren Commission Report's long - discredited theory that Lee Harvey Oswald was a \"lone nut.\" Bollyn's endorsement was significant: trained in Middle Fast studies, and a former resident of Israe l (where he was married to an Israeli woman) Bollyn is fluent in Hebrew and Arabic. In addition, his late mother was one of the library's founders, his wife was a volunteer at the library, and Bollyn himself had actually worked at the library as a young ma n Still, the library rejected he donation, saying it could find no \"professional\" reviews of the book. I daresay, however, that if the librarians had checked for a review of the Warren Commission Report, they would have found the one by Eugene Rostow in th e Washington Post. That I"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"715 Final Word? [617] suppose, would have justified the inclusion of the Warren Report in the library. But my book hasn't gotten those kind of favorable reviews — nor that any real surprise. THE ADL, YET AGAIN In any event, at a hearing of the libra ry board of directors, a furor erupted when Bollyn pointed out that several directors were partisans of Israel, suggesting the book was rejected because of the Israeli lobby's fervent objections to the book. When Bollyn raised First Amendment concerns, one pro - Israel partisan, Debbie Miller, dismissed him, proclaiming rather candidly: 'We own the First Amendment,\" although not saying who \"we\" were — although anyone with any understanding of the realities of modern - day \"freedom of speech\" in America could reac h their own conclusions. Already involved behind the scenes, the Chicago office of the ADL publicly stepped into the picture, with ADL spokesman Richard Hirschhaut declaring, \" We believe this is a cynical ploy, an attempt to create a First Amendment issue as subterfuge for an effort to exploit the goodwill and fair - mindedness of the public library system. The library should not be forced to put itself in a position of being a warehouse or central address for every bigot with an agenda.\" Previously based in the ADL's San Francisco office, Hirschhaut did not mention to the press that he had a personal axe to grind with me and with my then - employer, The Spotlight. Hirschhaut, in fact, had been one of the ADL officials under criminal investigation by the FBI and the San Francisco Police Department in 1993 for illegal domestic spying. At the time, top ADL spy Roy Bullock revealed that a June 30, 1986 Spotlight article that I had written had set in motion the events that led to the ADL scandal. Hirschhaut was trans ferred to Chicago by the ADL when the spy agency was busy trying to clean up the mess caused by the affair. In any case, the resulting brouhaha attracted the attention of the media and no less than five area newspapers and the PBS radio affiliate reported on the controversy as it dragged on over the next five months. Bollyn tried to get the self - styled \"Office of Intellectual Freedom\" (OIF) of the American Library Association (ALA) to take a stand, but the OIF's director, Judith Krug, refused to condemn the censorship. This was no surprise. Seven years previously, Krug sided with the ADL when the Israeli lobby raised a fuss after a Chicago librarian sponsored a resolution — endorsed by the ALA national convention — condemning Israeli censorship. With Krug's supp ort, the resolution was scrapped. While smaller local papers contacted me, Carri Karuhn, the reporter for the \"big\" Chicago Tribune, refused to return my calls. The Tribune also refused to publish a letter to the editor from me, responding to its coverage. Despite the pressure, Bollyn wouldn't back down. This presented a problem for the STDL board which ordered a new book selection process, under which the library's staff director appointed a three - member team of"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"[618] Final Judgment 716 librarians to review Final Judgment. The board then had the option to act on the trio's recommendation. The fix was in: dominating the team was Uri Toch — the STDL's translator for Hebrew, the state language of Israel. Toch concocted a highly inflammatory five - page smear of Final Judgment. This \"re view\" was leaked to the press along with the seemingly contradictory announcement the library was still going to put the book on the shelves, despite the negative review. The STDL trio said that since the debate over the book was \"largely a political issue ,\" they were recommending Final Judgment be added to the library even though they said the book was, among other things, \"poorly written, repetitive [and] based on questionable research methods and sources.\" They charged that Piper quoted sources out of co ntext said that he selectively quoted sources that fit his thesis and ignored others that did not. The trio endorsed the Warren Commission's \"lone nut thesis, saying only \"buffs\" believe here was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination. Although I was amused at the allegation the book was `poorly written,\" the other charges were far more serious and in response I compiled a thoroughly documented (and I think devastating) 88 - page response, eviscerating the malicious review. In the title of my response, I (accu rately) dubbed the library critique \"The Star Chamber Judgment,\" harkening back to the 17th century English tribunals that met in secret, delving out severe aid arbitrary punishments ID those who dared challenge the power of the British crown. The analogy was very much on the mark. What is interesting (but not surprising) is that the Israeli language translator and his team had gone to great lengths (however clumsy) to try to refute the thesis of the book. POLICE STATE TACTICS Meanwhile, the pro - Israel pa rtisans on the library board issued a statement saying the librarians had been \"professional\" and \"graceful\" in their malevolent attack on me and on the book. Then, at one point, the Israeli translator tried to get Bollyn arrested. Speaking to Toch on he t elephone, Bollyn asked Toch (in Hebrew) were Toch had lived in Israel. Toch called the police, crying he felt \"threatened.\" Enough was enough. On May 21, 2000, having decided — once again — to confront my critics head on, I traveled to Schaumburg and spoke at the library itself before some 150 people who turned out for the event. Notably absent were the three librarians — but they did have at least one vocal supporter who did show up. As Christopher Bollyn opened the meeting, there was a minor ruckus as a person identified as a member of the local Jewish community attempted to disrupt the event, shouting angrily that \"Gerald Posner's Case Closed tells the truth about the JFK assassination. Its available right here in the library.\" Posner's admirer"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"717 Final Word? stalked from t he meeting, smug and satisfied, although he never stayed around to defend his premise or to debate my thesis. It turns out that the ADL had already contacted the Schaumburg Police Department to \"brief\" them about me. In response to the ADL briefing, Schaum burg's police chief, Richard Casler, sent out word that one of the top Nazis in America was coming to town and that this Nazi bigwig had invited \"his followers\" to come to his rally. To preserve the peace, Chief Casler ordered five extra police officers on duty to prevent me from disrupting little Schaumburg and perhaps instigating another Holocaust. When I learned of this tough cop's toadying to the ADL, I called his office and asked to speak to him, but Casler wouldn't come to the phone. Instead, he send his deputy, Capt. Thomas Ostermann, who refused to either admit or deny that their office had been in touch with the ADL, saying that I was \"just a voice on the phone.\" But, I pointed out, \"Richard Hirshhaut of the ADL was just a voice on the phone, too, a nd you listened to everything that he had to say about me.\" No doubt accustomed to ordering around the jaywalkers of Schaumburg and being called \"sir,\" by those miscreants, Ostermann was a little surprised and exasperated with the way I was dealing with hi m and finally said that he was \"just a hard - working cop.\" I told him that I had no doubt that he was, but that he would do the people of Schaumburg a much better service by watching out for rapists and murderers rather than chasing down \"a fat guy with gla sses whose only crime was to write a book.\" The officer said nothing in response and I can understand why. When (and by whom) was it determined that the ADL is not only the final arbiter of who is allowed to speak anywhere on any given topic but also the o fficial liaison to police authorities for the purpose of deciding what tactics the police should use to protect the communities they are responsible for? If anyone has the answer to that question, I'd like to hear it now. In any event, speaking at the libr ary I drove home the following points:   The review by the librarians had indeed been the most energetic effort yet to attempt to demolish the thesis of Final Judgment but it fell pathetically flat, with the librarians resorting to transparent and flimsy lie s and deceptions.   Schaumburg taxpayers should question why their librarians were so enthusiastically and so clearly doing the bidding of the ADL.   The ADL itself refuses to debate me, but they relied on the librarians to try to refute the book, but the trio bungled the job. I also pointed out that — despite my refutation of the librarian's review — that you can be sure the ADL will cite this malicious review in the future as \"evidence\" that \"responsible librarians\" at one of the nation's most prestigious librari es found the book to be \"questionable,\" \"misleading\" and \"distasteful\" and \"of little merit\" — some of the choice terms used. The STDL librarians evidently recognized (quite correctly I might add) that the issue of JFK's conflict with Ben - Gurion over Israel' s nuclear ambitions was a very sensitive issue indeed, and therefore in their review"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"[620] Final Judgment 718 they engaged in a rather lame attempt to discredit the overall thesis of my book by trying to portray the conflict as less than significant than it truly was. The librari ans wrote as follows: Piper claims as fact that the \"primary reason\" for David Ben - Gurion's resignation as Prime Minister of Israel was his \"inability to pressure JFK into accepting Israel's demands.\" He cites Seymour Hersh's The Samson Option as evidence . As Hersh makes clear, and this is clearly evident in the quote Piper produces to prove that the \"nuclear option\" was the \"primary reason,\" this was just \"another factor.\" For the uninitiated — which includes most of those who read the library review, with out having read Final Judgment (or Hersh's book) — this might sound like quite a damning indictment. But the truth is that while other factors played a part in Ben - Gurion's resignation, the final showdown with JFK over the nuclear bomb was the proverbial \"st raw that broke the camel's back\" and, clearly, the \"primary reason\" behind Ben - Gurion's resignation. As all \"responsible\" and \"mainstream\" accounts of the Israeli nuclear bomb program affirm, the drive to build a nuclear bomb was not only a major aim of Is rael's defense policy (perhaps its very foundation) but also a particular special interest of Ben - Gurion. The fact is that Seymour Hersh's revelations about JFK and Ben - Gurion have been easily eclipsed by a more recent volume on the same subject — this one w ritten by an Israeli scholar, Avner Cohen. When Cohen released his 1999 book Israel and the Bomb (New York: Columbia University Press), the book created quite a sensation in Israel to the point that journalist Tom Segev writing in the Israeli newspaper Ha' aretz, declared that \"Cohen's book will necessitate the rewriting of Israel's entire history.\" At this juncture, before going into what Cohen has to say, it is incumbent upon me to advise the readers that Cohen privately told an interviewer (who then told me) that he (Cohen) had been shocked to learn about Final Judgment when he was doing an Internet search for information about his own book. Cohen also told another person, my aforementioned critic, James K. Olmstead — who posted Cohen's comment on the Intern et in a JFK discussion group — that he (Cohen) found it \"inconceivable\" that Israeli Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion would have had anything whatsoever to do with the death of JFK. That having been said, let's take a look at what Cohen does say about Ben - Gur ion and his most difficult relationship with JFK over the issue of Israel's nuclear bomb."},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"719 Final Word? In the opening pages of his book, Cohen writes at length about Ben - Gurion's special interest in the construction of an Israeli nuclear bomb and the reasoning beh ind it. What follows are relevant quotations from pages 10 through 14 in Cohen's book, although please note that I have re - arranged the quotes in order that these quotations are more free - flowing in the context of what Cohen has written. Cohen writes: Imb ued with the lessons of the Holocaust, Ben - Gurion was consumed by fears for Israel's security . . . In his public speeches and writings as prime minister Ben - Gurion rarely discussed the Holocaust. In private conversations and communications with foreign leaders, however, he returned to the lessons of the Holocaust time and again. In his correspondence with President John F. Kennedy in 1963, he linked Arab enmity to Israel with Hitler's hatred of the Jews, and wrote: \"As a Jew I know the history of my peop le, and carry with me the memories of all it has endured over a period of three thousand years, and the effort it has cost to accomplish what has been achieved in this country in recent generations . . . Mr. President, my people have the right to exist, both in Israel and wherever that may live, and this existence is in danger\" . . . Anxiety about the Holocaust reached beyond Ben - Gurion to infuse Israeli military thinking. The destruction of Israel defined the ultimate horizon of the threat against Isra el. Israeli military planners have always considered a scenario in which a united Arab military coalition launched a war against Israel with the aim of liberating Palestine and destroying the Jewish state. This was referred to in the early 1950s as mikre hkol, or the \"everything scenario.\" This kind of planning was unique to Israel, as few nations have military contingency plans aimed at preventing apocalypse. Ben - Gurion had no qualms about Israel's need for weapons of mass destruction . . . Ben Gurion s aw Arab hostility toward Israel as deep and long - lasting . . . Ben - Gurion's pessimism . . . influenced Israel's foreign and defense policy for years. Ben - Gurion's world view and his decisive governing style shaped his critical role in initiating Israel's n uclear program . . . Ben - Gurion believed that science and technology had two roles in the realization of"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"[622] Final Judg ment 720 Zionism: to advance the State of Israel spiritually and materially, and to provide for a better defense against its external enemies . . .\" Ben - G urion's determination to launch a nuclear project was the result of strategic intuition and obsessive fears, not of a well - thought out plan. He believed Israel needed nuclear weapons as insurance if it could no longer compete with the Arabs in an arms race , and as a weapon of last resort in case of an extreme military emergency. Nuclear weapons might also persuade the Arabs to accept Israel's existence, leading to peace in the region. On 27 June 1963, eleven days after he announced his resignation, Ben - Guri on delivered a farewell a d d r e s s t o t h e e m p l o y e e s o f t h e A r m a m e n t s Development Authority in which, without referring to nuclear weapons, he provided the justification for the nuclear project: \"I do not know of any other nation whose neighbors declare that t hey wish to terminate it, and not only declare, but prepare for it by all means available to them. We must have no illusions that what is declared every day in Cairo, Damascus, Iraq are just words. This is the thought that guides the Arab leaders . . . I a m confident . . . that science is able to provide us with the weapon that will secure the peace, and deter our enemies.\" To summarize this very long quotation: The \"nuclear option\" was not only at the very core of Ben - Gurion's personal world view, but the very foundation of Israel's national security policy. The Israelis were essentially willing, if necessary, to \"blow up the world\" — including themselves — if they had to do so in order to destroy the Arab neighbors they hate so much. This is what Seymour Hers h notes Israeli nuclear planners considered \"the Samson Option\" — that, as Samson of the Bible, after being captured by the Philistines, brought down Dagon's Temple in Gaza and killed himself along with his enemies. As Hersh put it, on page 137 in his book, \"For Israel's nuclear advocates, the Samson Option became another way of saying 'Never again,\" (in reference to preventing another Holocaust). So along came the STDL librarians who wanted to debate whether JFK's pressure on Israel over nuclear weapons was \"the\" primary reason or \"a\" primary reason or \"one\" (of several) reasons for Ben - Gurion's resignation. They were suggesting that I quoted Hersh out of context (and did so deliberately) because they realized, full well, that all of the evidence, taken toge ther in the big picture, clearly demonstrates that it was indeed JFK's determined effort to defuse \"The Samson Option\" that was very much so the primary cause of Ben - Gurion's resignation."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"721 Final Word? [623] The bottom line is that — in 1963 — the issue of JFK's conflict with B en - Gurion was a secret to both the Israeli public and the American public and it remained so for more than 20 years at least and still largely remains so, despite the release of Hersh's book, followed by Final Judgment and then the book by Avner Cohen. In fact, writing in The New York Times of October 31, 1998, Ethan Bronner, describing Cohen's book on the conflict between JFK and Ben - Gurion and the general issue of Israel's nuclear bomb program, said that all of this was \"a fiercely hidden subject.\" Now th at the truth is emerging, there are others who are reaching essentially the same interpretation that I have. The librarians would have people believe that I am alone in this interpretation. This is not the case at all. For example, Dr. Gerald M. Steinberg, professor of political science at Bar - Ilan University's BESA Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv has written of JFK's conflict with Ben - Gurion over Israel's nuclear ambitions. His essay, \"Israel and the United States: Can the Special Relationship Sur vive the New Strategic Environment\" was published in the December 1998 issue of The Middle East Review of International Affairs published at Bar - Ilan. Steinberg wrote: B e t w e e n 1 9 5 1 a n d 1 9 6 3 , t h e K e n n e d y administration placed a great deal of pressure on Be n - Gurion in the effort to press for acceptance of international inspection of Dimona and Israeli abdication of the nuclear weapons option. This pressure apparently did not alter Israeli policy, but it was a contributing factor to Ben - Gurion's resignation in 1963. [Emphasis by Michael Collins Piper] Read what Dr. Steinberg says: JFK's pressure on Israel over the nuclear bomb was a \"contributing factor to Ben - Gurion's resignation.\" However, to repeat myself, JFK's \"great deal of pressure on Ben - Gurion\" (Ste inberg's words) was not known in general to the public at large (either in Israel or the United States) until the release of Seymour Hersh's book which focused on the conflict quite extensively. But that's not the end of it. Avner Cohen's very powerful new book essentially confirmed everything that Hersh had written, in one sense or another, but went even further and we will be reviewing what Cohen has to say in detail later. But for the present, let's continue to dissect what the STDL librarians did to dis tort the words of Seymour Hersh. They wrote: In fact Hersh states that domestic factors . . . appeared to be more than enough to convince Ben - Gurion to leave public life . . . and Ben - Gurion's health . . . were as, or more important."},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"[624] Final Judgment 722 Th e STDL reviewers were actually putting words in Hersh's mouth! Hersh never once said that the domestic factors cited \"were as, or more important.\" The way the librarians structured this sentence in their review — was to put a different twist on what Hersh re ally did say. Hersh never said that these other factors \"were as, or more important.\" Those were the librarians' words — not those of Seymour Hersh. A 'THREAT' FROM JFK TO ISRAEL Here's what Avner Cohen in Israel and the Bomb, adds to the story of Ben - Guri on's resignation. Cohen describes how the conflict between JFK and Ben - Gurion was reaching its pinnacle in 1963 and how, on June 16 of that year, JFK sent a letter to the Israeli leader that Cohen says on page 134 of his book was \"the toughest and most exp licit message\" yet. Cohen added: The purpose of the letter was to solidify the terms of the American visits [to Dimona] in a way that would accord with these minimum conditions on which the intelligence community insisted. To force Ben - Gurion to accept th e conditions, Kennedy exerted the most useful leverage available to an American president in dealing with Israel: a threat that an unsatisfactory solution would jeopardize the U.S. government's commitment to, and support of, Israel . . . The showdown Ben - Gurion was trying to avoid now appeared imminent. Ben - Gurion never read the letter. It was cabled to [U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour] on Saturday, 15 June, with instructions to deliver it by hand to Ben - Gurion the next day, but on that Sunday , Ben - Gurion announced his resignation. Note Cohen's words: \"a showdown [between JFK and Israel] appeared imminent.\" Cohen then addresses the issue: \"Did Kennedy's pressure on Dimona play a role in Ben - Gurion's resignation?\" On page 135 he wrote: Ben - Gur ion never provided an explanation for his decision, except in reference to \"personal reasons.\" To his cabinet colleagues Ben - Gurion said that he \"must\" resign and that \"no state problem or event caused it.\" This is interesting, in itself, because — if Cohen 's account is correct — Ben - Gurion himself never even specified any particular reason, foreign or domestic. That doesn't refute Final Judgment, but it does have the impact of lessening the argument by the STDL librarians that the conflict with JFK over the b omb was just \"another factor.\" Cohen added:"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"723 Final Word? [625] Ben - Gurion's biographer suggested that there was no one specific political reason, but that it was his general mental state — manifested by a series of panicky, even paranoid, actions — of the previous ten w eeks that led the seventy - six year - old leader to resign. The very fact that Cohen writes — as I did in Final Judgment — of Ben - Gurion's apparent paranoia is interesting. Paranoid people do inexplicable things. They even commit murder. We should note, at this juncture, that (based upon what we have just considered) Avner Cohen made it quite clear that the construction of a nuclear bomb for Israel was, actually, a very personal issue with David Ben - Gurion for many years. Ben - Gurion believed that Israel's access to atomic weapons was critical to Israel's survival — and Ben - Gurion was the \"Grand Old Man\" of Israel. Cohen notes that several in Ben - Gurion's inner circle felt that the resignation had nothing to do with the nuclear issue. But Cohen goes on to point out t hat: Others, however, including ministers in Ben - Gurion's cabinet . . . believed that Ben - Gurion's decision was, in part, connected to Kennedy's pressure on Dimona. Israel Galili, the leader of Achdut Ha - Avodah [Israel's \"Unity of Labor\" faction], was co nvinced that Ben - Gurion's sense of failure and frustration in dealings with Kennedy on the matter of D i m o n a w a s a m o n g t h e r e a s o n s t h a t l e d t o h i s resignation. This is also the view of [top Israeli nuclear scientist] Yuval Ne'eman, who, in 1963, was . . . i nvolved in the consultations involving the replies to Kennedy's demands. Ambassador Barbour also hints that Kennedy's letters and Ben - Gurion's resignation might have been linked. In his telegram on Ben - Gurion's resignation, he noted: \"while probably not a major cause of dissension, this issue was itself not without controversy when Ben - Gurion presented it to his colleagues before dispatching his letter May 27. Cohen added on page 136 that Ben - Gurion had \"concluded that he could not tell the truth about Di mona to American leaders, not even in private.\" And this is saying a lot, considering the effort by critics of Final Judgment to say that Israel and the United States are such \"close allies\" that the Israelis would never ever think of doing something nasty to an American president — even one who was adamantly determined to stop"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"[626] Final Judgment 724 Israel from establishing a nuclear defense system that the nation's leaders considered critical to the nation's survival. However, unfortunately, our STDL librarian friends were no t finished on this point just yet. Let's continue with what the librarians have to say . . . Hersh also points out that \"Kennedy's persistent pressure on Israel stemmed from his belief that Israel had not yet developed any nuclear weapons. There is e v i d e n c e t h a t o n c e I s r a e l a c t u a l l y b e g a n manufacturing bombs — as the French had done — the President was prepared to be as pragmatic as he needed to be.\" The STDL librarians were engaging in some historical interpretation of their own at this juncture, quoting o ne brief passage of Hersh's book out of context. There is no question, based on all of the massive amount of material appearing in Hersh's book (and the aforementioned more recent study by Avner Cohen) that JFK was determined to stop Israel, in particular, from building a nuclear bomb. Here the STDL librarians were trying to predict what JFK would have done had he lived. Essentially what the librarians were saying is that because JFK was lenient with the French over the nuclear issue that he would certainly be as lenient with the Israelis once they followed the French in producing nuclear bombs (against JFK's opposition). But this is not true, as we shall see. JFK FOCUSED ON ISRAEL . . . In Final Judgment I pointed out that JFK had adopted a new policy tow ard the French drive for nuclear weapons that was being outlined in a then - \"top secret\" memo dated November 22, 1963. But there is no way that the librarians can suggest that just because JFK changed his policy toward France that he would also change his p olicy toward Israel's nuclear ambitions. Perhaps JFK would have been \"pragmatic\" (as Hersh says) but that doesn't mean that he was not trying to stop Israel from building a nuclear bomb — and that's what his trouble with Ben - Gurion and Israel was all about i n the first place. The fact is that any dealings that JFK had with France over the nuclear issue were insignificant compared to the bitterness between JFK and Israel over the same issue. By bringing in this matter of the French, the STDL librarians were tr ying to cloud the issue. The fact is that Israel was a special target of JFK insofar as nuclear proliferation was concerned. On page 99 in his book, Avner Cohen emphasizes JFK's particular pressure on Israel:"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"725 Final Word? [627] No American president was more concerned with the danger of nuclear proliferation than John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He was convinced that the spread of nuclear weapons would make the world more dangerous and undermine U.S. interests. He saw it as h i s r o l e t o p l a c e n u c l e a r a r m s c o n t r o l a n d nonproliferatio n at the center of American foreign policy . . . Kennedy reminded his advisers that more was at stake than a piece of paper — without an agreement, the arms race would continue and nuclear weapons would proliferate to other countries. The only example Kenned y used to make the point was Israel. [Emphasis added by Michael Collins Piper] Carefully note Cohen's words: \"The only example Kennedy used to make the point was Israel.\" Not the French or the Arabs. Only Israel. Cohen's book also makes it quite clear tha t the French — who had previously been the primary foreign enablers of Israel's secret nuclear arms program — had withdrawn their support after former French President Charles DeGaulle returned to power in 1958. Cohen writes on pages 73 - 74: By June DeGaulle h ad become aware of what he later termed \"the improper military collaboration established between Tel Aviv and Paris after the Suez Expedition, which permanently placed Israelis at all levels of French services,\" and he was determined to end it. DeGaulle wa s taken aback when he learned of the unorthodox manner in which the relations were conducted . . . It took almost two years to translate DeGaulle's determination into a new French nuclear policy vis - à - vis Israel. Cohen points out, however, that Israel's f riend in France, atomic energy minister Jacques Soustelle, resigned, and at that point DeGaulle learned that the French assistance to Israel had continued, despite his orders. Thus, in 1960 \"DeGaulle again demanded an end to this cooperation.\" Cohen adds: The French decision caused consternation in Ben - Gurion's inner circle. The end of French assistance would put the entire Dimona project at Risk. DeGaulle's decision was a sharp reversal from the written and unwritten obligations of his predecessors. . . . DeGaulle recognized how unprecedented the deal [between Israel and France] was, and for this reason refused to go along with it, reluctant to provide Israel with a nuclear option. France was trying to regain its position in the Arab world, and nuclear cooperation"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"[628] Final Judgment 726 w i t h I s r a e l w o u ld n o t b e h e l p f u l i n t ha t ef f o r t . [Emphasis added.] According to Cohen, a compromise was reached. Israel formally announced \"peaceful intentions\" (although clearly Israel still intended to build a nuclear bomb) and DeGaulle al lowed the French companies to continue working with the Israelis, but the French government withdrew its direct support. Of course, DeGaulle's reversal on the issue of what was clearly critical French support for Israel's nuclear ambitions is quite signifi cant indeed, particularly in light of what is documented in Final Judgment regarding the Mossad - sponsored Permindex operation that came to the fore during Jim Garrison's JFK assassination inquiry and which had been publicly connected to at least one assass ination attempt on DeGaulle prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. JFK'S PRESSURE ON ISRAEL CONTINUES . . . However, Ben - Gurion's resignation didn't end the conflict between JFK and Israel. What happened between JFK and the new Israeli prime m inister, Levi Eshkol, is perhaps even more interesting. Immediately upon Eshkol's succession, JFK wrote a letter to the new prime minister that was evidently even more strident (at least from the Israeli perspective) than even JFK's previous communications with Ben - Gurion. On page 155 Avner Cohen writes: Not since Eisenhower's message to Ben - Gurion in the midst of the Suez crisis in November 1956 had an American president been so blunt with an Israeli prime m i n i s t e r . K e n n e d y t o l d E s h k o l t h a t t h e U .

K e n n e d y ' s d e m a n d s w e r e unprecedented. They amounted, in effect, to an ultimatum . [Emphasis added] Cohen noted on page 159 that: From [Eshkol's] perspective, Kennedy's demands seemed diplomatically inappropriate; they were inconsistent with national sovereignty. There was no legal basis or political precedent for such demands,\" [emph asis added by Michael Collins Piper]. Cohen also points out that \"Kennedy's letter precipitated a near - crisis situation in the prime minister's office.\" So Kennedy's pressure on Israel did not end with the resignation of Ben - Gurion. Thus, the efforts by th e STDL librarians to focus on whether or not JFK's pressure on Ben - Gurion was the \"primary\" reason for the Israeli leader's resignation or whether it was only one of several factors was"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"727 Final Word? [629] actually insignificant in the big picture. If anything, JFK's pressu re on Israel intensified. On page 172 Cohen described a \"secret meeting\" held in Washington, D C. eight days before the JFK assassination (November 13 - 14) between the Israelis and the Americans, noting that Israel \"had a broader agenda . . . than the Unite d States was willing to discuss.\" Yet, Cohen notes, on page 173, \"Dimona itself was never mentioned in those talks. Both sides behaved as if the Dimona issue did not exist.\" In short, the nuclear issue was so sensitive that during face - to - face secret meeti ngs between United States and Israeli officials when they were discussing other issues between the two nations, the subject of Israel's nuclear bomb was not discussed. The issue was that inflammatory. It was left on the table — actually never placed on the t able — for future discussion. But JFK was assassinated eight days later, and the dynamics of the U.S. - Israeli relationship changed dramatically as a consequence. Cohen concluded his analysis of the JFK years on page 174 as follows: In any case, in late 1963 Israel and the United States, Kennedy and Eshkol, stumbled further down the path of nuclear opacity. Would the two countries have continued under Kennedy as it did under Johnson? What would Kennedy have done with regard to the Israeli nuclear program had he lived and been reelected, and to what extent would Israel's nuclear history have been different? These questions will never be answered with certainty. Neither Avner Cohen nor Michael Collins Piper nor the STDL librarians can answer these questions wit h certainty. But the reaction in Israel to Cohen's revelations about JFK's secret war with Israel over the nuclear question was interesting indeed. \" HAD KENNEDY REMAINED ALIVE . . . \" The Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz, published a review of Cohen's book on February 5, 1999, calling it \"a bombshell of a book.\" (And this review can be accessed in English in full on the Internet on Cohen's web site at the National Security Archive at George Washington University.) The Ha'aretz review, by Reuven Pedatzur, is qui te interesting. It reads in part: The murder of American President John F . Kennedy brought to an abrupt end the massive pressure being applied by the U.S. administration on the government of Israel to discontinue the nuclear program. Cohen demonstrates at length the pressures applied by Kennedy on Ben - Gurion. He brings the"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"[630] Final Judgment 728 fascinating exchange of letters between the two, in which Kennedy makes it quite clear to the Israeli prime minister that he will under no circumstances agree to Israel becoming a nuc lear state. The book implied that, had Kennedy remained alive, it is doubtful whether Israel would today have a nuclear option. Cohen also concludes that Ben Gurion's decision to resign in 1963 was taken to a large extent against the background of the trem endous pressure that Kennedy was applying on him concerning the nuclear issue. [Emphasis added by Michael Collins Piper] I couldn't put it better myself. Israeli journalist Reuven Pedatzur has summarized well the explosive revelations that appear in Avner Cohen's book. If this were a court case, I could rightly say, at this juncture, The defense rests.\" THE LYING LIBRARIANS But the STDL reviewers weren't just satisfied with quoting Final Judgment out of context (or with quoting Seymour Hersh out of conte xt). The librarians actually lied outright when they stated that: \"Piper also states that upon Kennedy's assassination Johnson 'promptly' reversed Kennedy's stance on Israel's bomb program.\" The record documents that the reviewers were lying. On page 59 in Final Judgment I wrote that Johnson \"promptly reversed Kennedy's Middle East policy .\" [Emphasis added here, not in Final Judgment]. I did not say in Final Judgment, as the reviewers claim, that Johnson \"'promptly' reversed Kennedy's stance on Israel's bo mb program.\" President Kennedy's stand against Israeli nuclear weapons was only one of numerous policy positions that were perceived by Israel to be contrary to its interests and this is documented in Final Judgment. There was much more to the Kennedy poli cy on the Middle East than Israel's nuclear bomb program and Final Judgment makes that perfectly clear, the STDL reviewers notwithstanding. This is also verified by the fact that during the secret meeting in mid - November, described earlier, the nuclear iss ue was not even discussed. There were many other issues to discuss. So the STDL reviewers are indeed the liars that I said they were. The reviewers also tried to suggest that Lyndon Johnson put as much pressure on the Israelis to curtail their nuclear bomb program, quoting a reference from Seymour Hersh. But what they do not point out is what Hersh also said in his book on page 143 in reference to LBJ's attitude toward Israel and atomic weapons:"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"729 Final Word? By the middle 1960s, the game was fixed: President Johnson a nd his advisers would pretend that the American inspections [of the Dimona nuclear arms plant in Israel] amounted to proof that Israel was not building the bomb, leaving unblemished America's n e w l y r e a f f i r m e d s u p p o r t f o r n u c l e a r n o n - proliferation. On page s 188 - 189 Hersh also provides an enlightening account which illustrates much about Johnson's determined effort to avoid facing the issue. Hersh describes how CIA analyst Carl Duckett had concluded that Israel had finally constructed a nuclear bomb and brou ght this fact to the attention of CIA Director Richard Helms who told Duckett that he would personally deliver the information to President Johnson. According to Hersh: Helms walked the Duckett information into the Oval Office and gave it to the President . Johnson exploded, as Helms later recounted to Duckett, and demanded that the document be buried: \"Don't tell anyone else, even [Secretary of State] Dean Rusk and [Defense Secretary] Robert McNamara.\" Helms did as he was told, but not without trepidation: \"Helms knew t h a t h e w o u l d g e t i n t r o u b l e w i t h R u s k a n d McNamara if they learned that he had withheld it.\" Johnson's purpose in chasing Helms — and his intelligence — away was clear: he did not want to know what the CIA was trying to tell him, for once he acce pted that information, he would have to act on it. By 1968, the President had no intention of doing anything to stop the Israeli bomb, as Helms, Duckett . . . and a very few others in the U.S. government came to understand. President Johnson obviously kne w how inflammatory the subject of Israel's nuclear bomb program was — and he did not want to be forced into taking any action that would put himself in the same position that his predecessor, JFK, had placed himself. According to Hersh, Johnson \"exploded\" ov er the subject and demanded that it be kept secret from even two top cabinet members. LBJ was the ultimate political dealmaker, the politician's politician, but he was clearly afraid of the issue of confronting Israel over the nuclear bomb. While Israel's nuclear bomb program was a major concern (as it should have been) the U.S. administration under Johnson never took any substantive action to block Israel from pursuing its longtime goal of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Certainly there was private rhetoric — but NO ACTION. Based upon what we know that has been presented in Final Judgment, we can certainly understand why."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"[632] Final Judgment 730 We might also have a good idea as to another reason why Lyndon Johnson decided not to run for re - election in 1968. Maybe the Israeli nuclear issue was — dare I say it — \"another factor\" (maybe even the \"primary\" reason) that LBJ decided to step down. Maybe \"domestic factors\" such as unrest over the Vietnam War were just the public issues that we heard about in the press — for we certa inly never heard about Israel and the bomb. This is speculation, of course, but quite reasonable speculation indeed. ISRAEL AND THE BOMB: FROM JFK TO LBJ But no more speculation. Let's see what Israeli writer Avner Cohen has said more recently about the transition from JFK to LBJ and its impact on Israel's nuclear arms program: On page 195 Cohen writes: On 22 November 1963 John F. Kennedy was a ssa s si na t ed a n d Ly n d o n B . J o hnso n beca me president. The transition from Kennedy to Johnson reminded Israelis of the transition from Ben - Gurion to [his successor] Eshkol . . . It also benefited the Israeli nuclear program.\" On page 196 Cohen added that Johnson \"lacked Kennedy's interest in nuclear proliferation in addition to his personal and political reasons for s upporting Israel,\" pointing out that \"a confrontation with Israel on the nuclear weapons issue was therefore less likely than it had been during Kennedy's years.\" Cohen also pointed out on page 177 that \"The transition from the Kennedy to Johnson administr ations changed the character and function of the [inspections of the Dimona nuclear plant in Israel] significantly.\" On page 193 he described this further: President Johnson was also more flexible than Kennedy on the rules of the Dimona inspections. The I sraelis were able to determine the rules of the visits, and the Johnson administration chose not to confront Israel on the issue, fearing that Israel would end the arrangement. [Inspector] Culler recalls that his assumption at the time was that the restric tions were agreed on at the highest level in both countries. Kennedy threatened both Ben - Gurion and Eshkol that non - compliance with his request could \"jeopardize American commitment to Israel's security and well being,\" but Johnson was unwilling to risk an American - Israeli crisis over the issue . . . Unlike Kennedy, Johnson was looking for a compromise that would serve the interests of both nations.\" [Emphasis added by Michael Collins Piper]"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"731 Final Word? As we have seen above, what Hersh said (cited by the STDL librar ians) does not conflict with the thesis of Final Judgment. Other material appearing in Hersh's book certainly coincides with facts unearthed by Israeli historian Avner Cohen and does not conflict with what the librarians called my \"conspiracy theories\" in any way. The bottom line is this: JFK was adamantly determined to stop Israel from building the nuclear bomb. LBJ simply looked the other way. JFK's death did indeed prove beneficial to Israel's nuclear ambitions and the evidence proves it. SO MUCH THEN fo r the efforts by the librarians to refute what they rightly perceived to be the foundation of the thesis of Final Judgment — that JFK’s refusal to countenance Israel's drive for the atomic bomb resulted in Mossad participation in the JFK assassination conspi racy. The one energetic effort to refute the thesis fell miserably flat. Although one of the STDL reviewers, Tom Holmberg, later posted an anonymous vicious smear of this author on amazon.com , he finally had the guts to put his name on the review. However, the favorable reviews of Final Judgment far outweigh (and certainly out - class) the ravings of Holmberg, Uri Toch and friends. UN - CORRUPTED MINDS WEIGH IN With all of this in mind, we can see why the Israeli lobby is so d etermined to suppress Final Judgment. It really is a \"dangerous\" book, at least in their perception. The Israeli lobby is concerned that people just might believe that the theory presented in Final Judgment does make sense. The fact is that when I have bee n able to present my thesis unhindered, to those who haven't actually read the book, people do say that the theory makes sense. A good example came when in the spring of 1999 (a year before the Schaumburg affair) I was invited to speak before an accelerate d seniors honor course in political science at the Thomas Worthington High School near Columbus, Ohio. Although the teacher who invited me, Tom Molnar, was aware of the previous frenzy that had erupted in Southern California, Molnar, to his credit, was unf azed. Despite all of this controversy — or perhaps because of it — Molnar still invited me to speak. In previous years, the ADL had objected to other speakers Mr. Molnar had invited. However, when Molnar offered the ADL the opportunity to appear in debate with those speakers, they refused to debate. He also refused to \"dis - invite\" the speakers. The ADL gave up. The students' written reviews of my presentation were in stark contrast to the anti - intellectual rantings and ravings of the ADL and their shills at the Schaumburg Township District Library. Here's a sampling of what four of these intelligent, young, sincere uncorrupted minds had to say: Michael Piper . . . seems well read and well versed in history. He adopted his beliefs from connections"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"[634] Final Judgment 732 that he m ade during his research. Mr. Piper seems to be a nice person and he does not seem to harbor any ill will toward Jews or foreigners. Many of his ideas seem to make sense but I think that some of his connections seem too complicated to be true. He also admit s that no truly hard evidence exists, and that we may never know the real truth behind the most famous American conspiracy. Michael was obviously well - educated to create such a thorough, comprehensive and believable compilation of events in his book. I wa s very much interested in Michael's speech and ideas. Just the thought that his story may be real left me doubting all other versions I have heard. I appreciated his attempt to expose the truth without hurting people's reputations unreasonably. I hope to r ead the book Final Judgment and read it thoroughly. Mr. Piper was very honest and did say that his whole theory is just a theory and that we will probably never know the entire truth. I actually did feel that there might be a possibility there that the Mo ssad could be blamed, since they are so well connected to everyone that apparently had some involvement with the assassination. A t f i rs t it wa s h a rd fo r me to u n d e r sta n d h i s reasoning for accusing the Mossad, but I soon began to see the possibility of his interpretation of the JFK shooting. he explained how many people had interpreted the event and how his version was more valid, and I basically agreed. I liked Mr. Piper. He was very intelligent and his theory was quite possible and understandable. It is precisely because of friendly reviews from intelligent students such as this that the ADL has been so determined to silence me. And I'm pleased to say that, according to Mr. Molnar, several of the students did indeed read the book — despite the ADL's objecti ons. In the end, this most uncomfortable issue of Israel's nuclear weapons is an issue that just won't go away. On May 2, 2000, the Chicago Tribune's foreign correspondent, Hugh Dellios reported that \"tired of guessing at the extent of Israel's nuclear wea pons capacity, Egypt and other Arab nations have launched a determined campaign to unmask Israel's secret nuclear program once and for all. In New York, Mideast officials are pressing a United Nations conference on nuclear disarmament this week to official ly"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"733 Final Word? [635] identify Israel as a nuclear power and force it to open its facilities to international inspectors.\" The Tribune described this as \"an uncomfortable predicament\" for the United States which has been trying to discourage the arms race between India and Pakistan but at the same time ignoring Israel's continuing nuclear arms build - up, noting that the affair \"could embarrass Israel as the only nation in the region that refuses to sign the [Nuclear Non - Proliferation] Treaty.\" The Tribune said that \"Israeli officials, who for the first time declined to attend the conference as observers, say they won't change their policy, which they maintain is the cornerstone of Israel's survival in a hostile region.\" Writing in the September/October 1998 Bulletin of the At omic Scientists (prior to the release of his book, Israel and the Bomb ) , Avner Cohen summarized the nature of Israel's nuclear drive, asserting: \"The nuclear program was probably the most complicated project Israel has ever undertaken — the most sensitive po litically, the costliest, the most challenging technologically, and the most secretive. In a sense, the nuclear program was the ultimate Zionist project. It was designed to insure the physical existence of the state of Israel . . .\" Now, however, \"this ult imate Zionist project\" (that played such a clearly critical factor in the JFK assassination conspiracy) is facing the attention of the world. BILL CLINTON WEIGHS IN — JFK - STYLE For his own part, JFK's longtime admirer, President Bill Clinton, dared to incu r the wrath of the Israeli lobby in the spring of 1999 by publicly addressing Israel's \"secret\" bomb. On May 14, 1999, the influential Jewish weekly, Forward, published an article expressing outrage and concern that \"President Clinton is raising for the fi rst time public concerns about Israel's nuclear program.\" The article pointed out that some 35 members of the U.S. Congress had written a letter to Clinton expressing concerns about imprisoned Israeli nuclear engineer Mordechai Vanunu who was the first to publicly expose — first hand — Israel's nuclear bomb production program. Responding in a letter dated April 22, 1999 to Rep. Lynn Rivers (D - Mich.), President Clinton did more than just express his own concerns about Vanunu's plight. Clinton also said that \"I . . . share your concerns about the Israeli nuclear program. We have repeatedly urged Israel and other non parties to the Non - Proliferation Treaty to adhere to the Treaty and accept comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.\" Forward repor ted that \"Jewish leaders reacted with shock at news that Mr. Clinton had weighed in on Mr. Vanunu and Israel's nuclear program,\" and cited the reaction of ADL director Abe Foxman (a vocal critic of Final Judgment) who also attacked Clinton, saying: \"I can' t believe the president would send such a letter. These are very sensitive issues. It is so judgmental.\""},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"[636] Final Judgment 734 However, Foxman's disgust with President Clinton was not unique. Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Ma jor American Jewish Organizations, declared: \"The president's reference to Israel's nuclear program is surprising and disturbing — as far as we know it's unprecedented.\" Unprecedented — in public. But not in private. For taking a similar private stand, Clinton 's hero, John F. Kennedy, paid with his life. THE LEWINSKY AFFAIR Ironically, the fact is that Bill Clinton himself may have found himself the victim of Mossad intrigue during the vaunted Lewinsky affair that led to his impeachment. A lot of American con servatives who hated Bill Clinton were frankly disturbed when I wrote in the February 23, 1998 issue of the weekly Spotlight that \"Maybe Hillary Clinton is right, and there is a 'right - wing conspiracy' to destroy her husband.\" However, I most assuredly ups et supporters of Israel when I added: \"But don't count on Hillary to tell you whose 'right - wing' is behind that conspiracy — and how the scandal is being used to manipulate U.S. Middle East policy.\" Hillary Clinton's argument that a \"right wing conspiracy\" i n America was behind the ongoing sex - and - perjury scandal that may topple her husband had one big flaw: After all, it was the major media in America — led by the Washington Post and Newsweek, joined by the New York Times and Time magazine, along with the majo r networks, that were hyping the scandal and suggesting that it might ultimately be Bill Clinton's undoing. Newsweek itself enlisted longtime Clinton confidant George Stephanapolous to write of Clinton's \"betrayal\" and young Stephanapolous, now a well - paid ABC commentator, even went on the air to bring up the possibilities of resignation and impeachment. And nobody had ever accused any of those major media voices of being a voice for the \"right wing\" — or the \"right wing\" in America, at least. WHOSE 'RIGHT W ING'? However, the first lady may have put her finger on something when she claimed that a \"right wing conspiracy\" was energizing the then - ongoing \"Monaco - gate\" scandal. But the First Lady didn't dare (at least publicly) to raise the suspicion that it was more than just certain elements in the American right wing who have helped bring the scandal to the public eye. In fact, in the midst of the Lewinsky scandal, one could easily find a connection that linked the hard - line \"right wing\" in Israel to the \"Moni ca - gate\" in Washington, D.C. It thus may have been no coincidence that just as the American supporters of Israel's right wing — the Likud bloc — were launching a major"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"735 Final Word? [637] (and bitter) public relations campaign against President Clinton that the major media in A merica picked up the lead and suddenly began trumpeting the allegations about yet another Clinton \"sexcapade.\" Here were some basic facts (reported in the major media itself) that somehow got buried in the midst of all the frenzy over the allegations that were bandied about. First of all, although the media focused on former White House staffer Linda Tripp and her brassy New York promoter friend, Lucianne Goldberg, as being the prime instigators of \"Monica - gate,\" the Washington Post pointed out rather circu itously in a story buried at the back of the paper on January 28 that lawyers for Paula Jones the young woman who was suing the president for sexual harassment] \"first received several anonymous tips that Lewinsky may have had a sexual relationship with th e president.\" It apparently wasn't apparently until after this that lawyers for Paula Jones contacted Miss Lewinsky, tipping off the president that his relationship with Lewinsky had been exposed. We may assume that neither the aforementioned Tripp nor Gol dberg were the sources, inasmuch as they had other interests to exploit in the Clinton - Lewinsky caper. In fact, Tripp instead went directly to Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Therefore, the big question was this: who tipped off the lawyers for Paula Jone s that there might be a \"smoking gun\" in the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky? Monica Lewinsky was a Clinton loyalist and it was evidently not Miss Lewinsky who leaked the story to the lawyers. So someone close to — or spying on — the president's inner circle had to have leaked the word about the president's relationship with Miss Lewinsky to Jones's attorneys. Although Michael Isikoff of Newsweek (published by the Meyer - Graham empire, which also owns the Washington Post) was the first journalist o fficially \"digging into\" the story, it now turns out that, according to the Post, reporting in passing on January 28, that one William Kristol — described generally as \"editor of the conservative Weekly Standard\" — was one of the first to \"publicly mention\" th e allegations. Kristol's role as being one of the \"first\" to float the story publicly, you see, is critical to understanding the big picture. Not only is Kristol the front man for billionaire media tycoon Rupert Murdoch — a major ally of Israel's hard - line L ikud — but Kristol himself is the son of journalist Irving Kristol and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, two self - styled \"former Marxists\" who have emerged as \"neo - conservative\" figures with long - standing close ties to Israel's \"anti - communist right wing.\" Youn g Kristol is, like his parents, a \"Likudnik\" and has been a harsh critic of President Clinton's decision to \"turn his back\" on Israel. Also significant is that Kristol, like Clinton, has been initiated into the Bilderberg Group, the high - level elite foreig n policy conclave dominated by the Rockefeller and Rothschild families, although Kristol (obviously) is identified with Bilderberg's \"Republican\" wing. And on January 26, just as the Lewinsky affair began escalating and engulfing Clinton, Kristol released a letter to Clinton, pressuring the"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"[638] Final Judgment 736 president to launch a military attack on Israel's hated enemy, Iraq. Signing the letter along with Kristol were a bevy of other famed American supporters of Israel's \"right wing.\" Then, in light of the Kristol - Murdoch connection, it is interesting to note that Murdoch's Fox television was essentially who is leading the charge in the Establishment media forcing the other networks to compete. The Fox News Channel carried the story almost non - stop around the clock. Even wh en other features were telecast, they were subject to interruption for any breaking developments in the Clinton scandal, regardless of how mundane they might have been. MEDIA PRESSURE ON CLINTON One daytime Fox tabloid show even brought in a reported spe cialist in \"body language\" to view a videotape of Clinton and Miss Lewinsky meeting in a receiving line after which the so - called specialist declared that Clinton was treating the young girl as though she were \"the first lady.\" Not surprisingly, in additio n, some of the most tawdry stories to break in the burgeoning scandal have been in the New York Post, along with other Murdoch - owned news publications. But the fact is that it wasn't just the so - called \"tabloid press\" that was putting on the heat. The \"res ponsible\" elements of the \"mainstream\" press — including the New York Times and the Washington Post — were also part of the effort against Clinton. In the meantime, in her effort to once again \"stand by her man,\" the first lady named television preacher Jerry Falwell and his friend, Sen. Jesse Helms (R - N.C.) as among those who were part of the \"right wing conspiracy\" that was out to get her president. What Hillary did not mention was that both Falwell and Helms were especially close to — once again — the hard - line \"right wing\" Likud bloc in Israel and both are adamantly opposed to President Clinton's perceived support for Likud's rivals in Israel's Labor Party which was far more amenable to the peace process. Clinton was not a backer of Likud's Binjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections that brought the Likud extremist coalition to power and was thus embarrassed politically when Netanyahu won by defeating the liberals led by the ostensibly more moderate Shimon Peres. The latter preached peace; Netanyahu, no compromi se. In fact, even prior to his official meeting with President Clinton, the Israeli prime minister had already met with (and appeared at a pro - Likud rally in the company of) Rev. Jerry Falwell, one of Clinton's most vociferous critics. Even the Washington Post had revealed on January 22 that \"a senior Netanyahu official had said the Israeli leader was prepared to respond to opposition from the White House by demonstrating his 'own ammunition' in U.S. political circles\" — namely Falwell and the boisterous pro - Zionist \"Christian right.\""},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"737 Final Word? [639] In Israel itself, according to the Post on January 24, the press had \"lapped up the Clinton allegations.\" The Post said that \"interest seemed particularly sharp because Monica Lewinsky is Jewish.\" Writing in the January 22, 199 8 issue of the Israeli daily Yedioth Aharonoth, Nahum Barnea wryly commented: \"We innocently thought the fate of the peace process was in the hands of a Jewess, born in Prague, named Madeleine Albright. Apparently, the fate of the peace process is, to no l esser degree, in the hands of another Jewess, named Monica Lewinsky, 24 years old, a Beverly Hills native, who spent a fun - filled summer three years ago as an [intern] at the White House.\" What is interesting is that by the time Barnea's comments were repe ated in the February 2, 1998 issue of Newsweek, which devoted a special issue to the scandal, Newsweek had carefully edited Barnea's words so that they now read: \"It turns out that the fate of the peace process depends on a different woman.\" In fact, the s candal forced the president into retreat as far as pushing Israel was concerned. On January 27, 1998 the Washington Post again let the cat out of the bag when it reported that \"last week, Clinton demonstrated he could not compel the Israelis to meet their responsibilities for a further military pullback. This week [in the wake of the scandal] he is even less capable, if only because people in his own party, not to mention the Republicans, will not support a policy of greater pressure on Israel.\" MOSSAD BLA CKMAIL? Perhaps it was really no surprise when, on March 3, 1999 — as the Lewinsky scandal was heating up — the hard - line Zionist New York Post screamed \"Monica Phone Sex Shocker,\" announcing that a new book, Gideon's Spies, by respected veteran author Gordon Thomas, had revealed that \"Israel Blackmailed Bill With Monica Tapes.\" The story, which appeared in Thomas' book, claimed that the Mossad had gained access to tape - recorded phone sex sessions between the president and Miss Lewinsky and had used the inform ation to force Clinton to call off a high - priority FBI investigation of a Mossad mole at the top levels of the national security establishment. True or not, the publication of the story was used by Clinton's critics (much to the delight of his enemies in I srael) to justify the allegation that Clinton's personal peccadilloes were a potential threat to national security and yet another reason for his impeachment. HILLARY'S SWITCHBLADE? So in light of all of this, is it really extraordinary to ask if when — in the midst of the Lewinsky controversy — the reason First Lady Hillary Clinton called for the establishment of a Palestinian state was Hillary's way of warning the Israelis what could happen if they didn't back off in their support of the elements that were trying to drive her husband out of office?"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"[640] Final Judgment 738 The world of political hardball is a dirty world indeed, and Hillary can play with the best of them, her apparent challenge to Israel evidence of this indeed. It was almost as if Hillary was flipping out a switchblade in a very ugly (and very public) alley fight. In the end, of course, Bill Clinton survived the impeachment trial, but there is no question whatsoever that there was very clearly the fine hand of Israeli intrigue behind the circumstances leadin g up to the impeachment. So we have indeed seen yet another American president, in this case Bill Clinton, facing yet another form of \"assassination\" at the hands of Israel. This is by no means a defense of Clinton, but it is a summary of relevant facts th at do lend an interesting insight into the way of power politics in Washington where the influence of Israel is concerned. CLINTON'S MENTOR Bill Clinton himself was a protégé of Sen. J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, and this, in itself, may tell us a li ttle bit about Clinton. When Fulbright took a stand in opposition to the Vietnam War, the major media hailed Fulbright for his \"candor.\" Yet, when he took a similar stand against Israel's Middle East aggression, he was called an \"anti - Semite.\" Speaking on CBS's Face the Nation on April 15,1973, Fulbright said: Israel controls the U.S. Senate. The Senate is subservient, much too much; we should be more concerned about U.S. interests, rather than doing the bidding of Israel. The great majority of the Senate of t h e U . S . — s o m e w h e r e a r o u n d 8 0 p e r c e n t — a r e completely in support of Israel; anything Israel wants, Israel gets. This has been demonstrated time and again, and this has made [foreign policy] difficult for our government. After a major media hulabaloo over the senator's remarks, vast amounts of Jewish money poured into Arkansas and Fulbright was defeated for renomination. And it's probably no coincidence — all things considered — that 1) top Jewish fundraisers helped finance Hillary Clinton's Republican opponen t in her 2000 Senate race, and that 2) Hillary just barely won the Jewish vote at the same time her Democratic ticket mate, Al Gore, was carrying the Jewish vote by an overwhelming 80% over George W. Bush. Rest assured, the Israeli lobby will never trust H illary Clinton. Yet, at the same time, growing realization of the power of Israel by grass roots Americans who are not afraid to discuss the subject is a reality that Israel and its American lobby must face. The fact that Final Judgment is now \"out there\" and reaching growing numbers of such Americans — and many others — is an additional ingredient in the mix. THE RABBI vs. THE GENERAL"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"739 Final Word? [641] There's no doubt about it: the word about Final Judgment is getting around. On October 29, 1998, Washington Jewish Week repo rted that Rabbi Abraham Cooper, self - styled \"associate dean\" of the Los Angeles - based Simon Wiesenthal Center had complained in one of his interminable press releases that \"in an interview given on Syrian Television, Syrian Defense Minister General Mustafa Tlas asserted that 'international Zionism' was responsible for the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\" The rabbi demanded that the Syrians provide official clarification \"as to whether or not these views expressed by one of Syria's most powe rful figures reflect Syria's official view of American history,\" although as of this time, the Syrians have not yet rushed forward to apologize. In any case, a Syrian friend of mine has advised me that General Tlas told him that he (the general) had read F inal Judgment and concurred with its conclusions. Earlier, the aforementioned Rabbi Cooper had attacked those who had come to my defense when I was under attack by the Anti - Defamation League in Southern California. Cooper said: \"They don't need to prove th at Israelis had a hand in assassinating JFK; they just have to plant the seed of suspicion that it might have been that way.\" Final Judgment has planted the seed of suspicion, but only because the facts assembled in this book paint a plausible scenario tha t is just as believable as other theses put forth about this most controversial subject. So that's why Rabbi Cooper and the ADL and others are so uncomfortable. THE LAST BROTHER . . . Just as the fifth edition of Final Judgment was being readied for th e printer, an odd thing happened. I was actually working on the final draft, and late on the night of June 14, 2000 (around 11:30 pm), I received a call from a friend who told me that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and a group of people were \"cutting up\" at the ou tside tables at the Hawk & Dove, a popular nightspot near my office on Capitol Hill in Washington. My friend offered to give a copy of Final Judgment to the senator. \"Why not?\" I thought. \"He's probably heard about it — one way or the other.\" I inscribed the book to Senator Kennedy and handed it to my friend who then proceeded to gingerly approach the senator. Looking up at the tall, lanky African - American in dark sunglasses who was approaching him, Kennedy asked, \"Can I help you, sir?\" My friend handed Kenne dy the book saying, \"A friend of mine asked me to give you this book. It's about the Mossad.\" The last Kennedy brother held the book in his hands, looking at the cover (as his companions strained to see what the book was about). After a moment, handing the book back to my friend, Kennedy said, \"Thank you, but no thank you. God bless you, and have a good evening.\" My friend accepted the book, saying, \"God bless you, to,\" and departed. That sad little story says so very much I feel somewhat guilty that I subj ected the senator to that experience, for — after all — it was the murder of his own big brother we're talking about here. But the fact is that Final"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"[642] Final Judg ment 740 Judgment does present a thesis many Americans believe is correct — and that's something that the senator and h is family have to accept. If there's anyone who knows how plausible the scenario is, that's certainly Ted Kennedy. He simply can't tell us he was unaware of his brother's efforts to stop Israel from building the nuclear bomb or that he was unaware of the b itterness that arose. No matter how hard Ted Kennedy proclaims that he and his family have been devout supporters of Israel, the facts demonstrate otherwise. And the Israelis also know that full well. We understand why Senator Kennedy feels compelled to sa y and do these things, but we also hope the senator understands why we really don't believe that he is sincere when he says the things he does. But I will leave you with this: one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Final Judgment is a certain gentleman who is a close family friend of one of the best - known high - ranking figures of JFK's inner White House circle. And while I can't reveal his name, I think that says a lot. THE BOOK THAT WON'T GO AWAY What is my own ultimate assessment of Final Judgment? M y own particular hope is that Final Judgment will receive the recognition that I believe it deserves and that there will be more efforts on the part of people who have read the book to explore the allegations that are made. I hope that people will be able to provide documents or other information that will confirm things that I could only speculate upon. Perhaps, in the end, the release of Final Judgment will bring forth new witnesses who can tell us things that we never knew before. I don't pretend to set myself up as the final arbiter on the JFK assassination (despite the perhaps presumptuous title of my book) but I do believe that it comes closer than anything yet written in summarizing the entirety of the conspiracy. I do look forward to seeing how futur e efforts at inquiry into the subject will be affected by what I have outlined in Final Judgment. I've said this before, but it bears repeating. I believe I have taken a new look at a very big jigsaw puzzle that displays a remarkably complex and somewhat m urky picture. On the puzzle you see before you all of the various groups and individuals that have been implicated in the JFK assassination conspiracy — an immensely confusing picture. However, when you turn the puzzle over you find one complete picture — and that's a great big very clear picture of the Israeli flag. All the other flags on the front of the puzzle are, in intelligence jargon, \"false flags,\" and Final Judgment proves just that. Final Judgment can rightly be called \"the book they tried to ban.\" Bu t, more importantly, in the end, Final Judgment encapsulates a thesis that they can't discredit. The genie is out of the bottle and neither Final Judgment nor the thesis it presents is about to go away. ―MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"INDEX E - book publisher’s note: The page numbers below from the soft cover version correspond to page numbers listed inside brackets in this e - book.

Kennedy because JFK stood in the way of Israel's efforts to build a nuclear arsenal. \"Final Judgment,\" by Michael Collins Piper, is not available in the bookstores, but has still emerged as an \"undergroun d best - seller.\" Here is what \"Final Judgment\" documents: When New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison charged businessman Clay Shaw with participation in the JFK assassination conspiracy, Garrison stumbled upon the Mossad connection to the murder of Pre sident Kennedy. Shaw served on the board of a shadowy corporation known as Permindex which functioned as a Mossad arms procurement front linked to the Swiss - based money laundering operations of Meyer Lansky, the head of the international crime syndicate wh o cooperated closely on many fronts with the American CIA. In \"Final Judgment\" the Israeli connection to the JFK assassination is exposed in frightening — and fully documented — detail. For example, did you know:   That JFK was engaged in a bitter secret conflic t with Israel over U.S. Middle East policy and that Israel's prime minister resigned in disgust, saying JFK's stance threatened Israel's very survival?   That JFK's successor, Lyndon Johnson, immediately reversed America's policy toward Israel?   That top Mafi a figures often alleged to be behind the JFK assassination were only front men for Meyer Lansky?   That the CIA's liaison to the Mossad, James Angleton, was a prime mover behind the cover - up of the JFK assassination? Why didn't Oliver Stone, in his movie \"JF K,\" mention any of this? It turns out the chief financial backer of Stone's film was longtime Mossad figure, Arnon Milchan, Israel's biggest arms dealer. These are just a few of the amazing revelations in this shocking book.

Rubinstein of Tel Aviv, Israel. Mr. Rubinstein's wonderful review lays to waste the tired old myth — propagated by the hard - line Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith — that Final Judgment is somehow \"anti - Semitic hate - mongering.\" The revie w follows: Israeli State Terrorism Exposed — An Amazing Book \"A landmark book for modern American history that should be on the bookshelf of every serious historian as well as every single concerned American. Let me give my reasons. \"This book is an extrao rdinary feat of investigative journalism. The information and facts that Piper uncovers are used in an extremely powerful way to reveal a whole sequence of Israeli/Jewish actions culminating in the assassination of JFK (who was an implacable opponent of th e Israeli nuclear weapons program of the early 1960's and 1950's ). \"The depth and thoroughness of Piper's investigative journalism literally takes one's breath away. At the same time the book is very easy to follow and understand as Piper methodically bui lds up his damning case against showing the depth of Israeli involvement in the JFK assassination. \"Once I started reading this book I could literally not stop until I had finished. I thoroughly recommend this book as a way to expand one's mind beyond the confines of the modern day media which has severely suppressed this book making it almost a taboo for mainstream booksellers to stock it. \"As an Israeli/American peace activist I welcome this book . This book is especially topical today as the search for p eace in the Middle East continues.

Although certain JFK assassination researchers such as Debra Conway and John Judge were quick to condemn Final Judgment and lent their personal support to efforts by the Anti - Defamation League (ADL) of B'nai B'rith to do s o, the fact is that the ADL has had nothing but snide remarks for sincere researchers who've worked to bring out the truth about the assassination. For example, in a fall 2003 report entitled Unraveling Anti - Semitic 9 - 11 C o n s p i r a c y T h e o r i e s — w h i c h h a d n o t h i n g t o d o w i t h t h e J F K assassination — the ADL compared current - day questions raised about the 9 - 11 attacks to questions raised about the JFK assassination. The ADL singled out JFK researchers as being among those \"conspiracy theorists\" — a term of derision in the ADL's lexicon — who disrupt society. According to the ADL: An initially erroneous news report later corrected becomes a \"true story\" that was later \"covered up.\" Moreover, virtually any unexplained or contradictory aspect of an event can be used as \"evi dence.\" In the case of the John F. Kennedy assassination, the conspiracy - minded believed that the shots directed at JFK occurred too quickly together to have been fired by one person. In short, in a few (but quite seriously intended) sentences, the ADL is dismissing 40 years of hard work by perhaps hundreds — maybe thousands (Debra Conway and John Judge included) — who have dared to take issue with the Warren Commission - ADL line regarding the JFK affair. In the ADL's twisted version of history, the only doubts about the JFK assassination arise from the fact that \"the conspiracy minded believed that the shots directed at JFK occurred too quickly together to have been fired by one person.\" This is insulting nonsense — a malicious attack on both sincere researchers and the millions who are convinced the official \"one lone nut\" ADL - Warren Commission theory is a lie. However, for the average person exposed to the ADL's lies — including vast numbers of news people, high school teachers, civic leaders and others — the ADL's misrepresentation of the very real evidence in the JFK assassination could be quite misleading indeed. And that, of course, raises the question as to why the ADL is so determined to lend its support to the JFK assassination cover - up in the first place.

It turns out Jack Ruby's rabbi, Hillel Silverman, was the key \"source\" for the Warren Commission's final judgment th at Jack Ruby was a simple nightclub keeper — just a bit crazy — who killed Lee Oswald out of sympathy for JFK's family. And we now know why the Warren Commission took Silverman's assurances to heart. The story of the Silverman - Warren Commission connection is t old by Dave Reitzes who was hailed by the prestigious Jewish Forward, on Nov. 28, 2003, for helping put down what Forward called \"zany\" theories on the JFK assassination, describing Final Judgment's theory — although not mentioning this book by name — as being \"more sinister\" than any other. On his website at jfk - online.com , Reitzes cites pages 35 - 37 of Final Disclosure, the memoirs of top Warren Commission attorney David Belin, the leading commission advocate of the theory that Oswald was a \"lone nut\" and that Ruby was not part of a conspiracy. According to Reitzes: Rabbi Silverman was one of Ruby's closet confidantes following his arrest, first meeting with him on November 25, then roughly once or twice a week thereafter u ntil Silverman moved to Los Angeles in July 1964. Silverman happened also to be friendly with Warren Commission junior counsel David W. Belin. The two had met during the summer of 1963, during a study mission to Israel. On one of Belin's first trips to Dal las on behalf of the commission, he asked Silverman his opinion as to whether Ruby was part of a conspiracy. 'Jack Ruby is absolutely innocent of any conspiracy,' Silverman unhesitatingly replied. [Emphasis added by Michael Collins Piper.] This \"oddity\" does not \"prove\" anything. HOWEVER: what are the odds that during a period when few Americans were traveling to Israel that a rabbi from Dallas and a Jewish lawyer from Des Moines should end up together in Israel on a \"study mission\" and that within six mo nths one of the rabbi's congregants would murder the alleged assassin of a U.S. president and that one of the lawyers investigating that crime — out of all the lawyers, not to mention all the Jewish lawyers, in the country — would be that Des Moines lawyer? Cr itics will say that raising this question is \"anti - Semitic,\" but the fact is that nobody has ever even dared (because of the fear of being called \"anti - Semitic\") to point out the obvious conflict of interest for David Belin due to his pre - assassination rel igious relationship with the personal religious counselor of one of the key figures in the JFK controversy."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"[658] Final Judgm ent 756 How the Mossad Skillfully Hid in Plain Sight: The \"Indispensible Mark\" in the JFK Conspiracy The late G. K. Chesterton (1874 - 1936) provided a means of understanding the Mossad role in the JFK conspiracy in the story of his fictional detective, Father Brown, thwarting a crime during a dinner party at an elegant hotel. In The Queer Feet, the villain infiltrated the party and made off with the silverwar e in the presence of a small handful of waiters and distinguished guests. Because both the waiters and the diners were attired in evening clothes, the thief dressed likewise. His ability to act and posture accordingly, despite his singular costume, made hi s crime possible. In the dining room, the criminal assumed the pose of a skilled waiter, moving swiftly, with precision — an \"obsequious attendant\" — keeping his distance, his eyes averted. Moving about elsewhere, the thief adopted the easy gestures, casual ma nners — the \"absent - minded insolence\" — of a society plutocrat, ignoring the hired help as he moved among them. Fortunately, Father Brown happened to be in the hotel and, as the crime was underway, overheard \"the queer feet,\" — that is, the abrupt change of foo tfall as the villain slipped in and out of the dining room, changing his persona with lightning speed, from fast - walking \"waiter\" to leisurely \"aristocrat.\" And so Father Brown captured the criminal and saved the day. Father Brown explained: \"A crime is li ke any other work of art. Every work of art, divine or diabolic, has one indispensable mark — the center of it is simple, however much the fulfillment may be complicated. Every clever crime is founded ultimately on some one quite simple fact — some fact that i s not itself mysterious. The mystification comes in covering it up, in leading men's thoughts away from it.\" * So it is with the JFK assassination. Because of its ability to infiltrate and/or manipulate or otherwise collaborate with such diverse groups as the CIA, organized crime, certain American \"right wing\" persons and organizations, the anti - Castro Cuban exiles, posturing accordingly, echoing concerns about JFK that these elements harbored, the Mossad assumed a protective coloration, operating behind th e other conspirators and yet effectively acted in the open, hiding — as they say — in plain sight. As such, the role of the Mossad and its motive in moving against JFK — his effort to block Israel from building nuclear weapons — became lost in the multiple, seemin gly disconnected and seemingly competing conspiracy theories that emerged in the wake of the assassination. Call it the \"missing link\" or \"the hidden picture on the other side of the jigsaw puzzle\" or the one \"indispensable mark\" pointing to the perpetrato r of the crime, the bottom line, however uncomfortable it may be to some, is that, in the JFK assassination, the Mossad connection is inescapable. *With all due credit to George O'Toole who first cited Father Brown's remarks in the context of the JFK con spiracy, although, of course, O'Toole was not referring to the Mossad."},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"757 Odds & Ends [659] Was a Short - Lived Cuban Exile Group a Mossad Front? The Strange Story of Paulino Sierra and Peter Dale Scott A possible key to unlocking the mystery of how the Mossad used Cuban exile \"false flags\" in the JFK conspiracy may well be a comprehensive examination of Cuban exile Paulino Sierra who popped up in April of 1963, flush with cash, offering to \"unite\" the exile factions under the banner of a new entity of his own creation, the Junt a of the Government of Cuba in Exile (JGCE). Numerous JFK researchers have referenced Sierra's intrigues, as did the late 1970s House Assassinations Committee. There's much more to the story, as we shall see. This much is certain: the Chicago - based Sierra was \"an unknown quantity to the Miami exiles,\" according to Warren Hinckle's Deadly Secrets. Sierra said \"Las Vegas and Cleveland gambling interests\" were financing him and, indeed, a \"considerable\" amount of money was funneled through Sierra's Chicago emp loyer, the Union Tank Car Company, although Union disavowed knowledge of the actual source of the funds. While the FBI showed little interest in the well - funded Sierra, the CIA noted two days before the JFK assassination that Sierra \"remains somewhat of a mystery man in terms of his means of support, and indeed, his long range objectives. Perhaps his mysterious backers are providing him with sufficient funds to keep the pot boiling for the present.\" [emphasis added]. Although Sierra distributed funds to a variety of exiles, it has been said the \"money was going down the drain with nothing to show for it.\" This may not true at all. In fact, Sierra and his \"mysterious backers\" funded the New Orleans - based Cuban exile training camp run by longtime Mossad asset Frank Sturgis where JFK assassination figures Guy Banister, David Ferrie and Lee Oswald and/or his \"double\" were seen in 1963. In the end, hardly more than a month after the events in Dallas, Sierra closed up shop in January of 1964 and, as Hinckle puts i t, \"was not to be heard of again.\" It appears that Sierra's aim had been accomplished. In fact, it was Sierra who financed the arms deal — referenced on the first page of the preface of Final Judgment — about which a federal informant inside the Cuban groups ( one Thomas Mosley) said he was told: \"We now have plenty of money — our new backers are the Jews — as soon as they take care of JFK.\" Now — as pointed out in Final Judgment — most JFK writers have carefully delete the phrase \"the Jews\" when describing this inciden t, and/or change the word \"they\" to \"we\" or fudge by noting it was unclear as to whether it was \"we\" or \"they\" who were going to \"take care\" of Kennedy, the totality of the mysteries surrounding Sierra — coupled with what Final Judgment documents — points agai n toward a likely Mossad role in the JFK conspiracy. Here's why: Since Sierra was funded by \"Las Vegas and Cleveland gambling interests,\" that unquestionably points toward Meyer Lansky's chief Las Vegas point man, Morris Dalitz (formerly Cleveland - based), who was a shareholder in Mossad operative Tibor Rosenbaum's Permindex entity which, as we have seen, played such a central role in the JFK conspiracy. In other words, if — as we contend here — Sierra's short - lived organization was a Mossad \"front\" designed to finance and manipulate the New Orleans - based operations used to orchestrate the JFK assassination — through the activities of Frank Sturgis, Guy Banister and David Ferrie, not to mention Permindex board member Clay Shaw — the money was provided by the Lansky syndicate's gambling ventures, which, as noted, were intertwined with the Mossad's Permindex operation. In addition, as former National Security Council staff member Roger Morris has shown in The Money and the Power, his landmark history of the intrigues o f Las"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"[660] Final Judgment 758 Vegas — in which he notably points out the multiple Israeli connections of the crime figures involved — the Lansky - Dalitz casinos were heavily engaged in money laundering linked to covert activities of the CIA and also, certainly — although Morris doesn't say it — those of the Mossad, which intersected in many areas with the machinations of the CIA. Peter Dale Scott seems particularly concerned about the circumstances surrounding the \"our new backers are the Jews\" story and claims that this was concocted as part of a scheme by the real conspirators behind the assassination (whom Scott never names) to launch a public relations campaign blaming \"the Jews\" for the JFK assassination. The problem with this, of course, is that although anti - Semites did make such al legations their remarks were never — not once — given any credibility or promoted outside anti - Semitic circles! The theory that \"the Jews\" were behind the assassination had no public relevance at all. Needless to say, Scott — and others who make this claim — ignor e that quite relevant fact. However — as they say — the plot thickens. There's much more to the story. Scott contends further that the story suggesting Sierra's group — allegedly funded by \"Jews\" — was involved in the assassination was part of a more subtle plot b y the real conspirators (whom Scott never names) to force Robert Kennedy into blocking any serious inquiries into his brother's murder. In this regard, Scott asserts that Sierra was actually a facilitator of anti - Castro operations being carried out by Robe rt Kennedy (on behalf of his brother) on a \"second track\" even as JFK was making other quiet, friendly overtures to Castro. In fact, Sierra's operation may have been part of the effort — one Enrique Ruiz Williams allegedly being the contact point between RFK and Sierra. The bottom line, in Scott's scenario, is that the possibility of involvement by Sierra's group in the assassination forced RFK into backing off from investigating JFK's murder because it could backfire, exposing Kennedy family plots against Ca stro. However, as even Scott points out, Sierra met in April of 1963 — the time he established his suspicious \"Junta\" — with former CIA Director Allen Dulles, Lucius Clay, a senior partner of Lehman Brothers, the famed Jewish \"Our Crowd\" banking firm, and atto rney Morris Liebman. What Scott doesn't mention is that Liebman was a major player in several high - level intelligence - connected institutions integral to what is known today as the \"neo - conservative\" network known for its determination to place Israel's sec urity as the central concern of all U.S. foreign policy making. So Sierra's contacts went well beyond his role as an operative for RFK. What Scott strenuously wishes to avoid is the likelihood that either the Mossad was Sierra's actual handler or that the Mossad co - opted lower - level operatives in a covert Kennedy - sponsored assassination plot against Castro and utilized them for the Mossad's own purpose, namely, the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The Mossad would certainly have seen the brilliance in usin g a top - secret (and potentially scandalous) Kennedy family venture as the \"cover\" for its own scheme to remove JFK from the White House. Peter Dale Scott has reportedly been fiercely hostile to those who have dared mention Final Judgment in his presence. W e can understand why. Final Judgment fills in the missing pieces of the JFK puzzle — those aspects that Scott (and others like him) prefer to avoid or to suppress for reasons known only to them."},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"759 Odds & Ends [661] The Mossad Link to New Orleans Police Intelligence; The Long - Suppressed Story of Fred (Efraim) O'Sullivan Critics who say Final Judgment is \"anti - Semitic and anti - Israel propaganda\" will have a hard time explaining the revelations which appeared in the December 3, 2004 edition of the international edition of The Je rusalem Post, in an article written by Arieh O'Sullivan, the military correspondent for the Post, one of Israel's most distinguished newspapers. In his article, \"The secrets of Dallas: 41 years after JFK, what my dad still won't tell me,\" we learn that the author is the son of Fred O'Sullivan, who, as a 26 - year old New Orleans Police vice squad detective, testified on April 7, 1964 before the Warren Commission. The senior O'Sullivan had grown up half a block from Lee Harvey Oswald and sat in front of Oswald in home rooms in school, their last names both beginning with \"0\" and later recruited Oswald to join a Civil Air Patrol (CAP) unit in metropolitan New Orleans at the time David Ferrie was active in the CAP. In retrospect, O'Sullivan's testimony and statem ents to the FBI and the Warren Commission and subsequent investigators for the House Assassinations Committee seem to somewhat (and perhaps deliberately) vague in some respects, as far as the precise links between Ferrie and Oswald are concerned. And momen tarily we may understand why that is the case. Writing in The Jerusalem Post, the younger O'Sullivan asserts that his father — who is now in a nursing home in Mississippi, his brain dimmed by strokes — did express his opinion that \"Lee\" had killed JFK \"by hims elf\" but added that, \"Well, I have my suspicions who helped him.\" O'Sullivan says \"my father always intimated that he thought there was more to the story and that the plots to kill JFK and black rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. . . . crossed paths in New Orleans.\" Now here's where it all gets interesting — at least as far as the likelihood of a Mossad connection to the JFK assassination and its cover - up is concerned. It turns out that Detective Fred O'Sullivan ended up as commander of police intelligenc e in New Orleans and then later, as the younger O'Sullivan writes, \"threw away our Christmas tree, lit the big brass menora and took off for Zion land.\" In other words, O'Sullivan converted to Judaism and left with his family for Israel where he became \"Ef raim\" — no longer \"Fred.\" The younger O'Sullivan describes how his father would \"keep secrets better than anyone I have ever known.\" He writes: \"Once I stumbled upon a Lebanese driver's license in his name, with his photo in it, in his desk drawer. He shrugg ed it off, telling me it was for my own good I not know. I was brought up not to prod.\" Obviously, ex - New Orleans intelligence squad chief Fred O'Sullivan went to work for Israel's Mossad. O'Sullivan is telling us that without directly telling us that. And today the son of this trusted American Irish Catholic cop who converted to Judaism and moved to Israel and worked for its intelligence agency is now the military correspondent — no obscure position, by any means — for the nation's most prestigious newspaper. Does all of this \"prove\" anything? No, but it is another strange piece of the JFK puzzle that has an unusual \"Israeli connection.\" The question is how far back O'Sullivan was sympathetic to and/or recruited by the Mossad and what, if anything, he did as a high - ranking police intelligence officer to hinder, for example, Jim Garrison's inquiries into David Ferrie and the Mossad - linked Clay Shaw. The fact that the very individual who recruited Lee Harvey Oswald into the Civil Air Patrol (where Oswald met David Ferric, his first major contact in the intelligence community) went to work for Israeli intelligence is provocative indeed."},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"[662] Final Judgment 760 Respected Veteran JFK Researcher Penn Jones Said: Mossad \"a completely overlooked area\" in JFK Affair The late Texas newsman Pen n Jones, the scrappy, no - nonsense publisher of The Midlothian Mirror and one of the most outspoken early pioneer critics of the Warren Commission Report, has long been revered as a tower of integrity by many independent JFK assassination researchers. Even the ubiquitous John Judge — who has been a hateful critic of Final Judgment and its author — has called Jones \"an honest journalist\" who \"did much original research on the case.\" The truth is that as far back as 1968 — sixteen years before Final Judgment was fir st published — Penn Jones was suggesting that JFK researchers start looking into Mossad connections as far as the JFK conspiracy was concerned. That's right. Penn Jones — not Michael Collins Piper — said it. This is something those who admire Jones — but who fear mentioning \"the Mossad\" in relation to the JFK assassination — will find difficult to acknowledge, for it may suggest after all, that Final Judgment may be on target. In a Midlothian Mirror column (dated January 18, 1968) and published on page 51 in the 1969 edition of volume III of Jones' Forgive My Grief series, Jones wrote: Jack Ruby was a close intimate of the members of the Dallas Police force and other United States law enforcement agencies, as well as the Israeli counter intelligence organization. His one - time employee, Nancy Zeigman Perrin Rich was also close to these same forces. Identifying Ruby and Nancy as being involved with the Israeli intelligence opens up a completely overlooked area concerning the assassination of President Kennedy. Jones's di sclosure somehow seems to have been lost in all of the minutiae surrounding inquiries into the JFK assassination Some years later, in a Midlothian Mirror column (dated February 24, 1972) and republished on page 54 in the 1974 edition of volume IV of Jones' Forgive My Grief series, Jones wrote further: [Jack] Ruby was admittedly used by the FBI in small - time information gathering, but he appears to have been a bigger operative for some other agency or country . . . There are many indicati ons in the Warren Hearings and other places that Ruby, and \"Honest Joe\" Goldstein were intelligence operatives in a small way for someone. And Abe Weinstein's Colony Club seems to have been used at times as a \"safe house\" for operatives. And considering wh at we now know of multiple Israeli connections in Dallas and in Texas (as noted in the new material in the opening pages of Final Judgment), it is quite likely that these three Jewish entrepreneurs may indeed have been working for the Mossad, as certainly Jones suggested that Ruby was. We owe a great deal to the late Penn Jones for — fearless researcher that he was — not hesitating to dare to mention \"Israel\" in a less - than - flattering context, in this case, involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. N onetheless — yet again — we find a little - noticed \"Israeli connection\" in JFK lore that has somehow been \"misplaced.\"And this harkens back to the fact that even New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison also stumbled on the Mossad connection, but even Garriso n's admirers don't like to acknowledge that. If it seems that we are \"harping\" on the Israeli connection, it's because we are. It's because nobody else will do it, despite all of the evidence that's there."},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"761 [663] A Challenge to the Readers . . . After all the clues had been scattered in front of the readers, the authors of the Ellery Queen mystery novels would issue \"a challenge to the reader\" to come up with the solution to the crime before the detective gathered all of the suspects together in the drawing roo m to unveil the murderer. My challenge to the readers is somewhat different. Now that you've read the book and heard my presentation in its entirely, I'm challenging the readers to show me any factual errors or any twisted reasoning or quotes taken out of context or any misrepresentations which would (once exposed) disprove the theory laid forth in this volume. As of this time, I am aware of the fifteen following factual errors or misstatements that appeared in previous editions of Final Judgment and which have been corrected. Those previous errors were (for the record): (1) In the first and second editions, I cited a source which erroneously reported that no Jews died when Israel's Mossad orchestrated the bombing of Goldenberg's Deli in Paris on August 9, 1982. This error was corrected in the third edition, at which time I noted that the error was brought to my attention by a friend (who happens to be Jewish) whose aunt was visiting Paris at the time of the Mossad crime and who escaped being a victim hersel f. Although the lady's companion (who was Jewish) did go into the deli and died in the bombing, my friend's aunt went elsewhere and thus survived. So that error was corrected, although it had nothing to do with the thesis of Final Judgment or even with the JFK assassination itself. (2) In the third edition of Final Judgment, I cited former FBI man William Roemer's book, War of the Godfathers, as the source for my statement that longtime Lansky Syndicate figure Morris Dalitz had been shot down in the street s of Las Vegas and was later poisoned to death in his hospital room. In fact, Dalitz did not die in the colorful way Roemer's book described. Dalitz, apparently, died of natural causes. By way of explanation, it appears that although Roemer has written so me \"non - fiction\" relating to the history of organized crime, his book which contained this (false) description of Dalitz's death also includes some literary license on Roemer's part. According to Roemer, War of the Godfathers was \"a work consisting mostly of fact\" but that \"in those limited portions that are fictionalized, the underlying basis is either fact or an inferential projection thereof.\" In any case, recalling that Dalitz had indeed died — and recalling, as I was preparing the third edition of Final Judgment that Roemer's book had provided a graphic description of his demise — I mistakenly relied upon a portion of the book that Roemer would refer to as having been \"fictionalized.\" I apologize for my reliance on Roemer's reputation as an authority on the mob. However, my error (based on Roemer's fantasy) was corrected as of the fourth edition of Final Judgment. I nonetheless hasten to add, however, that this error had nothing to do with the thesis of Final Judgment or with the JFK assassination itself."},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"[664] Final Judgment 762 (3) and (4) The third and fourth apparent errors (which I discovered myself) involve the statement (in the first three editions of Final Judgment) that Texas arms dealer Thomas Eli Davis III, an associate of Jack Ruby, was found to have documents cont aining the name of Lee Harvey Oswald on his person at the time that he (Davis) was taken into custody in Algeria for involvement in smuggling arms to the French OAS. In fact, according to new research published in 1996 in Oswald Talked by Ray and Mary LaFo ntaine, it turns out that the reference to \"Oswald\" in Davis's possession was a letter of introduction to Madrid - based arms dealer Victor Oswald. It also appears that Davis was held in a Moroccan jail, rather than an Algerian jail, as I stated. My source f or the incorrect data regarding Davis's travails was Jim Marrs, writing in Crossfire. The two errors notwithstanding, the fact is that Davis was connected with Jack Ruby and was indeed involved in the Israeli - connected affairs of the French OAS in North Af rica. So, again, I will say this: these errors do not disprove the thesis of Final Judgment. And, anyway, it was Jim Marrs' error — not mine. (5) In the first printing of the fourth edition I accidentally referred to John Foster Dulles as the CIA director f ired by JFK. I knew, of course, it was his brother, Allen Dulles, who was the CIA director in question. (6) In the first printing of the fourth edition I said that John Connally, the former governor of Texas, died in 1995. In fact, he died in 1993. (7) In both printings of the fourth edition I said that a scandal forced Sen. Gary Hart to withdraw from the race for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. In fact, it was the campaign for the 1988 nod. (8) In previous editions in discussing the clos e relationship between CIA contract agent Guy Banister and self - described \"super communist hunter,\" A. I. Botnick of the New Orleans office of the Anti - Defamation League (ADL), I was unaware Botnick had left New Orleans to take a position in the ADL's Atla nta office (before Oswald came to New Orleans) and did not return to the New Orleans ADL office until 1964. One of my critics, Jerry Shinley, brought this to my attention. This has no bearing on the basic thesis of Final Judgment nor does it detract from m y speculation (which is clearly noted as such) that it is possible that Lee Harvey Oswald's activities as an investigator for Banister may have been contract work for Botnick's ADL associates by Banister who joined the ADL in \"fact finding\" relative to lef tist groups such as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee with which Oswald claimed affiliation (9) In previous editions I stated that former Los Angeles detective Gary Wean met in Dallas with former Senator John Tower (R - Texas). The meeting actually took plac e in Ruidoso, New Mexico. (10) In the fourth edition in discussing Clay Shaw's relationship with the CIA, I said that \"inasmuch as Shaw later served, without question, as a valued international contact for the CIA, reporting back to the agency on his fore ign ventures, it is certain that Shaw's reports would have ultimately ended [up on] the desk of James J. Angleton.\""},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"763 A Challenge to the Readers [665] That much is true. However, I over - stated the matter when I went on to assert that \"Shaw, in fact, was one of Angleton's operatives. \" Whil e there is no evidence Shaw was \"one of Angleton's operatives,\" per se, it is almost certain Shaw's reports crossed the desk of Angleton or his subordinates' at one time or another. I am pleased to make this clarification, after JFK researcher Clark Wilkin s brought this over - statement to my attention. (11) In the 4th edition I referred to a photograph (widely discussed in JFK research) that purported to show Clay Shaw with David Ferrie. Since then, others determined (to my satisfaction) that the person wit h Shaw is not Ferrie. There is other evidence, however, the two knew one another. So, again, this error does not impact on the thesis of Final Judgment. (12) In previous editions, I cited Robert Morrow's false assertion that a Pakistani - American was the \" second gun\" in the killing of Robert F. Kennedy. The accused gentleman has unquestionably proved his innocence, but this does not disprove Morrow's basic thesis that the Iranian SAVAK (a creation of the CIA and the Mossad) carried out the RFK assassination . (13) In previous editions, I cited authorities suggesting the CIA contract assassin QJ/WIN may have been Frenchman Michael Mertz. Since that time QJ/WIN has been identified and that has been noted. Yet, this fact, of course, does not impact on the basic thesis of Final Judgment. (14) In previous editions, including the first printing of this 6th edition, I suggested no one had ever seen the famous Gemstone Files themselves and that people had only seen the \"Skeleton Key\" to the files. In fact, some peop le have seen the files. However, this error — again — has nothing whatsoever to do with the thesis of Final Judgment itself. (15) In the first printing of this 6th edition, in the \"odds and ends\" item about Jack Ruby, I wrote that the city of Dallas was \"hard ly an outpost of Jewish culture.\" Instead, as new material in the second printing of the 6th edition demonstrates, Dallas was, in 1963, a major outpost of Jewish power, a critical point firming up the thesis of Final Judgment and diminishing other theories surrounding the JFK assassination. So those are the errors (and minor ones at that) appearing in previous editions. Are there more? Have I misquoted any published sources or taken them out of context? Am I guilty of twisted reasoning? Have I misrepresente d anyone's opinions or any facts that others have presented? Please tell me. I do want to know. As noted in the afterword, Washington Jewish Week, in its April 28, 1994 edition, accused me of \"quoting out - of - context secondary sources, making unlikely tenuo us connections, and asserting untruths over and over as if their repetition will magically impart validity.\" An Israeli diplomat called my theory \"nonsense.\" Others call it \"outrageous\" and one woman — Marcia Milchiker — went so far as to say that my theory wa s \"scientifically unprovable\" as though I had suggested it was scientifically provable in the first place. That's what the critics are saying. Thus, my challenge to the readers: Show me where I'm wrong. ―MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"Now it's all up to you . . .

Box 15728 WASHINGTON, DC 20003 EMAIL: PIPERM@LYCOS.COM Dear Reader: The word about Final Judgment is getting out there, much to the dismay of the Israeli lobby. The book and its thesis are not going to go away. Worldwide attention is now focused on Israel's nuclear weapons, and Final Judgment has played a part in helping make that happen. Although there have been numerous public efforts to silence me or denounce me, rest assured my enem ies have also worked quite maliciously and skillfully against me behind the scenes. At one point, \"they\" deployed an asset to infiltrate my publisher's office: to destroy me personally; to undermine famed JFK researcher, Mark Lane (my publisher's attorney) ; and to seize control of the publishing company itself! The story has never been told — though some day it may be. Considering what's happened, I cannot help but conclude I have accomplished something important with Final Judgment since such corrupt, perver se and evil forces have been so determined to hurt me and to attempt to scuttle further distribution of this book. So you can understand why I appreciate the continuing expressions of support from good people. I always look forward to letters and construct ive criticism from my readers. Keep them coming! MICHAEL COLLINS PIPER"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"THE AUTHOR THE ISRAELI LOBBY LOVES TO HATE... There's no doubt about it — Michael Collins Piper, the author of Final Judgment, is one of the Israeli lobby's primary targets today. Rep eatedly and bitterly attacked by propagandists for Israel, Piper is undaunted, despite the fact his life was publicly threatened by Irv Rubin, violent leader of the terrorist Jewish Defense League. Once, after discovering an illicit wiretap on his home tel ephone, Piper noted wryly, 'The Vatican didn't put it there.\" In the style of his combative, colorful great - great - grandfather, famed bridge builder \"Colonel\" John Piper — surrogate father and early business partner of industrial giant Andrew Carnegie — the out - spoken author relishes any opportunity to confront his many critics head - on, although generally they refuse to debate him. Like his ances tor, Michael Collins Piper is also a bridge builder in his own way. . . In recent years, he has lectured across t he globe in places as diverse as Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates; Moscow, Russia; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Tokyo, Japan and across Canada. Police - state - minded advocates of war and imperialism have been disturbed at Piper's energetic efforts to forge links of common understanding among peoples of all creeds and colors. Once described as \"The American Voltaire\" — recalling the Enlightenment crusader against bigotry and tyranny — Michael Collins Piper is truly the author the Israeli lobby loves to hate . . W idely known as a lover of dogs, cats and all animals and an unapologetic old - style American progressive in the LaFollette - Wheeler tradition, Piper considers the labels of \"liberal\" and \"conser - vative\" archaic, artificial and divisive, manipulative media bu zzwords designed to suppress popular dissent and free inquiry. Once offered a lucrative assignment in a covert intelligence operation in Africa, Piper turned it down, preferring his independence — a position in keeping with his ethnic heritage: another of Pi per's great - great - grandfathers was a full - blooded American Indian. Twenty years before the major media discovered the \"neo - conservative\" cabal that pushed America into the Iraq war, Piper was reporting on their intrigues. In 2004, in The High Priests of Wa r, he assembled a fascinating overview of their insidious record, the first book ever pub - lished on the subject. In his provocative 2005 work, The New Jerusalem, Piper confronted the controversial issue of Zionist power in America, a detailed exposition un like any ever assem bled by any modern author. Piper's authoritative lecture to the Zayed Centre, the Arab League think tank, on the topic of American media bias, has been distributed worldwide. Sourcing much of his work from his own massive library of som e 10,000 volumes, Piper writes for American Free Press, the Washington - based national weekly, and in the historical journal, The Barnes Review. One media critic hailed Piper as one of the top 25 best writers on the Internet today. Throughout his career, Pi per led the way on several major stories. In 1987, he was the first to expose the Justice Department frame - up of Pennsylvania State Treasurer Budd Dwyer that led to Dwyer's shocking public suicide. Piper was also the first to expose San Francisco - based Roy Bullock as an operative for the Anti - Defamation League (ADL), a conduit for Israel's Mossad, involved in illegal spying on American citizens, seven years before The New York Times acknowledged Bullock's ADL link. The ADL will never forgive Piper far his p ivotal front - line role in unmasking Bullock. Piper was the only journalist to assert — based on hard evidence — that the Oklahoma bombing was a Mossad \"false flag\" operation designed to implicate Saddam Hussein — a scheme derailed by U.S. investigators who rejec ted Israel's machinations, opting for a \"lone nut\" cover - up. Today, Piper's pioneering work on Israeli links to the 9 - 11 tragedy is echoed by truth seekers and, predictably, damned by defenders of Israel for its accuracy. Piper can be contacted by e - mail a t piperm© lycos.com or by writing: Michael Collins Piper, P.O.

However, on August 21, 1997, newspapers across the United States―echoing a report that first appeared in The Lost Angeles Times ―told the story of an uproar over a scheduled lecture at a small California college by Michael Collins Piper, the author of Final Judgment . Pro - Is rael pressure groups were working overtime to prevent Piper from being heard. They feared college students would be “too impressionable” and might actually take Piper’s thesis seriously. Piper was being attacked for daring to speak the truth―the little - known fact that JFK had been embroiled in a bitter (then - secret) conflict with Israel over its drive to build a nuclear arsenal, weapons of mass destruction. What made this so objectionable to the Israeli lobby was that in Final Judgment Piper had docume nted that there were multiple connections of Israel’s intelligence service, the Mossad, to many key players often linked (in other widely - known books on the subject) to the JFK conspiracy―a point missed (or deliberately suppressed) by others who had studi ed the assassination over the years. Whether the CIA or “the Mafia” or “the right wing” or “the military industrial complex”―you name it―Piper demonstrates that the Mossad connection is there. And that’s why his thesis is so “controversial.” If you initia lly have any doubts about the thesis, the author himself suggests you first take a look at the comprehensive photo section which summarizes the book . . . and then, take it from there, if you dare. In recent years, as word about the explosive revelation s appearing in Final Judgment began to circulate worldwide, demand for the book became so immense that second - hand copies were selling on the Internet for as much as $185 per copy, demonstrating the drastic need for re - publication of a new, easily accessi ble edition of this important work. While the major media continues to ignore Final Judgment ―as much as is possible―a number of individuals whose expertise cannot be ignored have begun to publicly lend their support to the thesis, one which becomes all the more significant in light of growing global concern about the proliferations of weapons of mass destruction in Middle East. The author continues to ask other JFK assassination theorist to debate him publicly about the thesis of Final Judgment and begs for his critics to demonstrate where he has misinterpreted facts or distorted the writings of others who have delved into the subject―but thus far no one has come forth to do so. They either ignore his work or call him names. However, thousands of satisfi ed readers believe Michael Collins Piper has indeed “pinned the tail on the donkey.” Once you’ve read FINAL JUDGMENT , you’ll never look at the JFK assassination in the same way again ."},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"Erratum Note: The following reflect minor spelling, “typo,” and punctuation changes in this ebook compared to the 6 th edition soft cover version.
