It results from research undertaken to substantiate this hypothesis: that Nazism is not the product of some \"spontaneous generation\" crystal- lized by Hitler's evil genius; and that it is not—as it has often been described—simply a reacti on to the harsh terms of the Versailles treaty; finally, that Nazism does not derive from some basic trait of the German character. Chapter I is introductory. It presents a few characteristic quotations from German writers of the past one hundred and fifty years. These passages, all written by members of what may be called the Prussian School, are evidence that Mein Kampf is merely a rehash of ideas frequently expressed be- fore Hitler voiced them. But what was the common inspira- tion of these earlier authors? In seeking an answer to this question, we first perceive th e contours of the conspiracy— very old but very real. Its exis tence—fantastic, at first thought —remains the only possible explanation of the facts. Chapters II—VII are an attempt to retrace this centuries- old conspiracy, the actual subject of this book. Chapters II and III examine in particular the hidden forces responsible for the rise of Prussia and the Germany of Bismarck and Wilhelm II. Chapter IV introduces the \"Fehme,\" the blood tribunal of the Middle Ages, into the picture. Chapters V, VI and VII show that Hitler's ri se to power would have been impossible had not Hitler placed himself and his movement at the service of the Prusso-Teutonic forces.

During one of the sessions of the Bavarian \"Landtag\" (Parlia- ment), the Deputy Gareis, with a heavy pile of documents in his hands, made a statement to the other Deputies which none of them seemed able to understa nd: \"I have here the evidence of a thousand years' conspiracy—evidence which I shall pre- sent to you shortly.\" A few days later Gareis was murdered. The criminal escaped punishment and the incident was practically for- gotten. The evidence to which Gareis had referred was never revealed. It was eighteen years after this, in 1939, that German mili- tary might began its goose-stepping march across the borders of Poland, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece. Today it is bent upon world conquest. The forces which launched Germany on the path of con- quest are those which were behi nd the murder of the obscure Bavarian Deputy. Those responsib le for the conspiracy which Gareis mentioned decided—whe n he sought to unmask them —to destroy him. It was thes e men—all members of the same conspiratorial group—who, some eighteen years later, decided that the time was ripe to place world mastery in German hands. Hitler and Nazism had very little to do with this conspiracy, although they occupy the present spotlight.

But these men are only tools in the hands of much more powerful forces. We shall have a great deal to say later about these forces—the \"Prusso- Teutonic\" groups and organizations. If we want to win this war we must see our enemy clearly —and we cannot cure a sick wo rld unless we understand the true nature of the disease. To destroy the evil we must first identify it. And this will be of equal importance even when the war is over and our probl em is to win the peace. The Forerunners of \"Mein Kampf” We intend to start this iden tification with the forerunners of Mein Kampf. We cannot expect to locate the roots of the evil in the literary field. Bu t literature is a good mirror of much deeper currents.* The writings of Treitschke and von Bernhardi and of the other authors of the Pan Germanic school were widely dis- cussed in the United States and England before and during the last World War. Their c onnection, however, with the whole evolution of the Prussian idea—from the thirteenth century up to Nazism—has in general not been sufficiently emphasized. Mein Kampf is a significant work from many points of view, but this work and its author, Hitler, are not the source of all evil in present-day Germany. In 1913, more than ten years before the publication of this work, General von Bern- hardi, who had enormous influence on the army and the younger generation of Germany, stated in his book, Our Future: \"For us there are two alternatives and no third— world dominion or ruin.\" * All quotations in this chapter from German and French authors are my own translations.

P.W."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 5 Surplus Population as a Springboard In Germany and the Next Wa r, published in 1912, General von Bernhardt had this to say: \"Strong, healthy and flourishing nations constantly increase the number of their population; consequently they will be faced, after a given moment, with the necessity of extending their borders, of acquiring new land, in order to settle the overflowing population. However, since the Earth is almost completely settled by this time, acquisition of new land can be gained only at the expense of its present occupants—that is through conquest—which becomes a law of necessity. \"The right of conquest is uni versally recognized. At first this can be effected through peaceful means; overpopulated countries pour out streams of em igrants into other lands and territories. These emigrants, while submitting to the laws of the new land, try to create favorable living conditions for themselves to the detriment of the original inhabitants and in competition with them. This means conquest. \"Finally, the right to conquer through war has always been recognized. When an increa sing population cannot acquire colonial lands from their primitive and uncivilized occupants, and if it is nevertheless desirable to retain for the State the surplus population which can no longer be supported, there is only one thing left to do—self-preservation will force this nation to war and to the conquest of foreign lands. Right no longer belongs to the possessor, but rather to those who are victorious in war. . . . \". . . In such cases, right belongs to those who have strength either to maintain or to conquer. Might is the high- est law. Before its tribunal war is the gauge of strength—war whose decisions are always biologi cally just since they evolve from the very essence of all th ings. . . Even from the point of view of Christianity, one would come to the same conclu- sion. True Christian morality is of course based on the creed"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY of love: 'Love God above all, and thy neighbor as thyself.' This law, however, can claim no validity insofar as relations between nations are concerned, since, when applied to politics, it would surely lead to a conflict of allegiances. For an indi- vidual to profess love for another country would in most cases result in a negating of love for the people of his own country. A political system based on such foundations would surely be subject to the worst aberrations. Christian morality is personal and social, and can never become a political reality. It strives to develop the ethical personality, and to give it strength, so that this personality can live altruistically, in the interests of a community.\" The cynical frankness of von Bernhardi is as great as Hit- ler's cynicism. Both resort to hypocrisy when their deductions are too unpalatable for their public . Both consider their special mora! conception above discussi on and consequently do not discuss it. It is evident from the General's text that he looks upon emigration of surplus population only as a provisional rem- edy and that his solution consis ts of perpetual conquest. He prefers conquest, which \"preserves\" the surplus population \"for the State\"—and when he speaks of \"State\" he is thinking, of course, of the German Stat e. He does not explain what natural law makes it necessary to preserve this surplus popu- lation for the State, nor why it cannot be peaceably integrated with the populations of other nations if there is no room left in the homeland. That \"you wi sh to preserve them for the State\" is a premise which needs no justification for this preacher of Germanism and Prussianism. \"The very essence of the State is power,\" furthe r declares von Bernhardi and, quoting Treitschke, that other great theoretician of German power, adds: \"anyone not sufficientl y virile to face this truth squarely has no right to meddle with politics.\" Not for a moment does von Bernhardi consider limiting the populations of nations reproducing too rapidly. On the con-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 7 trary, his point of departure is that \"strong, healthy, flourish- ing nations increase their numbers.\" In this, the conclusion is implicit: the German people, obvi- ously strong, healthy and flourish ing, will always have excess population, and consequently will ceaselessly have to annex territory until they dominate the world. \"World dominion or ruin,\" the final tragic alternative of von Bernhardi's, implies, of course, that if Germany does not succeed in dominating the world, another country will perform this task, which awaits the strongest; and in that case the Germans will go to their ruin. Facing this choice, which he believes inevitable, his decision is made.* War as a Necessity Von Bernhardi's \"indispensable\" conquest can be accom- plished only by war and the Gene ral believed that war should be not a defensive but an offensive operation—or rather, out- right aggression. He cites the Prussian example as proof of this: \"Indeed, the foundation for Prussia's strength was estab- lished by the Great Elector** through successful wars of his own choice. Frederick the Great continued in the glorious tradition of his noble ancestor. . . . Of all the wars through which he led his people not one was forced upon him; he never tried to delay the start of any of these wars. In order to deprive his foe of the advantage of the first movement he would take the initiative by attacking so that he could assure * Note at this point what von Bernhard i considered to be the first step toward world dominion: \"In one way or another we must settle with France in order that we can gain that military freedom of action so neces- sary to our world politics. This is th e first and most necessary demand for healthy German politics, and since the traditional French hatred for us can never be overcome through peaceful means, we must conquer it by sheer force of arms. France must be so thoroughly beaten that she will never be able to stand in our way.\" **Friedrich Wilhelm (1640-88)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY himself the best chance of success. How successful he was is well known. Had he lacked this heroic decisiveness, the entire historical development of European nations, and of mankind, would have taken a different turn.\" Given such a state of mind the conclusions of present-day- pacifists—to the effect that \"War doesn't pay,\" or \"If the Treaty of Versailles had not been so harsh, this war would never have broken out\"—prove singularly impotent. But General von Bernhardi did not invent anything him- self. He only reduced to a formula a mode of thought cher- ished by a series of German predecessors, A century earlier Dietrich von Buelow (1757-1807), in Modern Methods of War, using a style cleverly veiling, by technical military terms, purposes none may doubt, said: \"If the amount of mili- tary resources must sooner or late r decide victory, it is obvious that little nations ca nnot succeed against the big ones, better equipped with war materials. In ancient times courage and dis- cipline compensated for the inequalities of mass power among nations. . . . Today, however, al l moral strength, all individ- ual military talent of the small in number necessarily fails against the great. It is necessa ry, of course, to make good use of your own superiority of num bers in accordance with mod- ern methods of war, but ir remains certain that in modern battle the weak have never conquered the strong unless the latter have made some mistake. Besides, these modern methods of war have been developed only very recently. We shall know better how to benefit from all these advantages in the future. \"Great empires are not only wealthier. Their natural fron- tiers are more extensive than t hose of small, neighboring states. It happens frequently that a sm aller state is completely en- closed within the borders of the larger one. . . . What a double advantage for the latter! \"I refer here only to small adjoining states, for in the nature"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 9 of things, it is first necessary to attack one's neighbor before coming to more distant States. If this ride is not observed countries separating two main adversaries may declare them- selves either nnith or agains t the great empire. Should they declare themselves against this power everything is changed, since a coalition of little States is equivalent to one big State. Even in such a case, however, the concentration of power and coercive means in the hands of a single political body may still give the great power a milita ry advantage over any federa- tion of independent States.\" Despite the reservations stated in these last lines, if leaders of all the little States successively engulfed by Hitler had taken the trouble to reread these words in time they might perhaps have been able to decide upon a common course of action instead of maintaining an illusory neutrality until their fall. To get people to accept the idea of \"perpetual war\" (indis- pensable for the achievement of perpetual conquest), philo- sophical, or at least biological, arguments are needed. German science finds them, and demonstrates that the state of war is but a process of natural select ion, permitting the human race to improve itself. Thus von Be rnhardi states: \"Without war, inferior or degenerate races c ould easily pollute and weaken all healthy, vital elements by their weedlike growth, and a general decline would be the re sult. 'War,' says A. W. von Schlegel, 'is as necessary as the st ruggle of elements in nature.' \" Heinrich von Treitschke (1834-1896), like von Bernhardi, had great influence on the thinking of the generations of Ger- mans immediately preceding Nazism. Treitschke is a conspicuous example of what is known as \"Prussianism.\" We shall see later what significance the forma- tion of \"Prussianism\" had in the evolution of German thought. Specifically we shall see that \"Prussianism\" is much less an ethnic reality than a special state of mind, a crystallization of thought that has developed over the course of centuries"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY through some remarkable process. Close examination of Prus- sianism will permit us to see more clearly into numerous details of the German problem. Treitschke, this typical Prussian, was not legitimately a Prussian at all. Son of a Sa xon general, descended on his father's side from a recently Germanized Czech family (a fact he was reluctant to admit), Treitschke was powerfully at- tracted to the Prussian way of thinking. This Prussian by vocation deemed that only Prussia possessed the necessary strength to dominate all the ot her German States and lead Germany toward the conquests he so ardently desired. Concerning the concept of war and its role in the existence of nations, Treitschke preached thus to future generations: \"War is not only a practical necessity, but is also a theo- retical necessity, an exigency of logic. The concept of a State implies the concept of war, since the essence of a State is power. The State is the people organized into a sovereign power. . . . \"A State which renounces war and which in advance sub- mits to an international tribunal gives up this sovereign power, that is, its very self. Whoever dreams of permanent peace asks for something not only unachievable bat absurd; he commits an error of elementary reasoning. . . . \"War, it is true, may alienate nations from one another and yet, to a certain extent, it brings them closer together, by making them acquainted with their own and their neighbors' resources. War as an intermediary among nations is often more effective than universal trade. A nation which clings to the visionary hope of everlasting pe ace will inevitably end in decay within its haught y isolation. History builds and destroys tirelessly; never weary, she e xhumes humanity's divine treas- ures from the ruins of ancient worlds in order to restore them to a new world. To whoever may believe in this perpetual growth, in the eternal youth of our race, it is quite evident that war is an inevitable necessity."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 11 \"That war should be forever banished from the earth is not only an absurd hope but profoundly immoral. If it were ever realized, we should witness atr ophy of many essential, sub- lime forces in the human soul, and transformation of the ter- restrial sphere into a vast temple of selfishness . . . \"On the other hand, the State has the right to consider itself an end, since it contains the e ssential conditions for prosperous social life . . . \"Every people, and particularly one of high cultural devel- opment, runs the risk, during a long period of peace, of degen- erating into egotism.

And why has war been, in every age, the favorite theme of the arts?\" The cynicism of Treitschke's reasoning is remarkable: war, in itself, is a blessing, but it would be dangerous to confess it to the people (\". . . the reason the value of this remedy is so rarely appreciated is that no doctor among mankind dares to prescribe war as a beneficial potion for a sick people\"). Instead of such a frank admission the cry of alarm is sounded: \"The State is in peril—our existence is threatened,\" and people rush into war with enthusiasm. It would be an illusion to believe that Treitschke speaks in the abstract, or that his purpose is to develop theories to bene- fit humanity. Reasoning in this manner, he hopes to benefit only his own people (\"our race,\" as he has already expressed it), whose fate alone concerns him: \"To whoever may believe in this perpetual growth, in the eternal youth of our race, it is quite evident that war is an inevitable necessity.\" This was written in 1869. The opinions of Treitschke and von Bernhardt are not iso- lated phenomena, but derive from distant sources. And if we admit that Mein Kampf merely outlines clearly the objectives of a certain Germany, without adding anything really new, it is interesting to note that Hitle r's spiritual ancestors were in turn descended from a long line of thinkers of similar leanings. It was a mistake on the part of the Western world not to attach in time sufficient importance to this type of thought— which was in violent contradiction to the basic ideas of West- ern civilization. Doubtless people were lulled by the illusion that such thinking represented purely theoretical fantasies of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 13 a few German scholars. They were nor able to see that actu- ally such thoughts were extremely\" significant manifestations of a state of mind having its root s in the distant past; and that these manifestations might in turn result in a very particular and very dangerous way of thi nking in future German genera- tions. Later we shall discuss the early, fundamental causes of Ger- man aggressiveness. Fo r the moment let us review briefly more recent spiritual ancestors of Hitler, contemporaries and pred- ecessors of Treitschke and von Bernhardi. Starvation as a Springboard Friedrich List (1780-1864), along with several minor econ- omists active around 1840, was res ponsible for formulating the principal theories on which present-day German economic conquest is based. After emigrating to Pennsylvania and becoming an Ameri- can citizen, List was concerned only with Germany's great- ness. He returned to Germany in 1840 to publish there his principal work, in which he outlined the basis for his National System of Political Economy. Violently opposed to the prin- ciple of free trade because it gives the same advantages to weak as to strong nations, he would we lcome its use without reserva- tion within the continent of Europe, once the continent were dominated by Berlin; and he had high hopes that this would be achieved as soon as possible. So far as his own age was con- cerned, however, he was an extreme protectionist and advo- cated development of new i ndustry in Germany—through high protective tariffs raised against competition of foreign countries. He took into full account the risk of losing Ger- many's foreign markets, since protectionism always provokes reprisals. His remedy is simp le: stimulate tremendous expan- sion of Germany, including conquest of Europe, acquisition of colonies in Australia, New Zealand, India and the Americas."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Then Germany would no longer have to fear that she might lack foreign markets in a protectionist world. According to List a nation mu st conquer all countries lying in its sphere of economic action—by degrees, but steadily; and this sphere of action is defined as every territory which may serve as outlet, or whic h contains raw materials the nation may need. In the long run this becomes perpetual con- quest, for eventually every foreign country, however distant, represents a potential export mark et, or is a producer of useful raw materials. In the ideas of List, we find the economic basis for General von Bernhardi's thesis: \"For us there are two alternatives and no third—world dominion or ruin.\" And here too is to be found the complete outline of Germany's recent and present economic attitude—the old thesis, slightly improved upon by Dr. Schacht. The process is simple. Schacht's Germany settled into a sys- tem of the most absolute protectionism, the system so dear to List. This was accomplished through methods more modern and effective than tariffs. Germ any was the first country, after the World War, to return to exchange control, adopting it not because of any financial need, but deliberately, in order to create a system of total protectionism. The old-fashioned protectionist use of high tariff s to discourage imports becomes outdated. Imports are now made practically impossible: the State releases no currency to private business to cover cost of imports purchased abroad, with the single exception of certain raw materials or tools considered by the State to be absolutely indispensable. As in all system s of protectionism, the popula- tion of the country whose production is thus \"protected\" must suffer: and their suffering becomes more acute the more the system is improved. Soon the world is accused of starving the German people, and of withholding raw materials neces- sary to German industries. (No mention is made of the fact that these materials had been available to Germany in a world of free exchange—the system she was the first to deviate from;"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 15 and that her importers, on a free monetary market, could have obtained the necessary funds to pay for any quantity of raw materials.) Germany is pictur ed as \"deprived of her place in the sun.\" Thus a favorable ps ychological atmosphere is cre- ated within the country and abroad as well, to prepare for world conquest \"by degrees, yet st eadily,\" as outlined by List. The achievement of List's plan for the future is considerably advanced by the repetition of the specious statement to the German people: \"Poor Germany must starve unless she suc- ceeds in dominating the other nations.\" List bolsters the self-confidence of his compatriots by assert- ing that a specific determinis m demands supremacy of the German race. According to him, the Latin races, under French influence, and the Slavic nations led by Russia, have not the power for domination. Germanic races, among which he included Anglo-Saxons and Ge rmans, possess this power to the greatest extent. Of the two, his choice is simple: Germany must supplant England; build a powerful fleet, extend her colonizing to all corners of th e world; and finally unite all other Europeans against English supremacy, so that she can direct the destiny of the world. Charles Andler, a French author, summed up certain ideas of List in his work, The Orig ins of Pan-Germanism, published in 1915:* \"It is necessary to organize continental Europe against Eng- land. Napoleon I, a great strate gist, also knew the methods of economic hegemony. His continen tal system, which met with opposition even from countries which might have profited from such an arrangement, should be revived, but, this time, not as an instrument of Napo leonic domination. The idea of uniting Europe in a closed trade bloc is no longer shocking if Germany assumes domination over such a bloc—and not France. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, willingly or by force, will enter this 'Customs Federation.' Austria is assumed to be * Charles Andler, Les origines du Pan-Germanisme, Paris, 1915."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"16 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY won over at the outset. Even France, if she gets rid of her notions of military conquest, w ill not be excluded. The first steps the Confederation would take to assure unity of thought and action would be to establish a joint representative body, as well as to organize a comm on fleet. But of course, both the headquarters of the Federation and its parlia mentary seat would be in Germany. \"At once the sharing of common commercial advantages would begin. List proposes something like a cooperative league of nations, in which all profits would be distributed in pro- portion to investments. European vitality, intelligence and order would put the Far East to good use. Oriental ports would become 'Free cities' where European agents would deal with native authorities in the capacity of advisors duly accredited and diplomatically protected. Austria would extend its borders to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. A German navy would be built up. Prussi an colonies would be estab- lished in Australia and New Zealand, where England has firmly planted her flag but ha s failed to exploit resources. How could England resist all the navies and the concentrated economic power of a united Central Europe? \"Since Germany possesses a grea ter stock of vital energy and superior economic ability to that of any other nation one may guess which nation would be likely to benefit most from this association,—an association which was to be based on the principle of equal privilege for all members.\" Various firsthand reports have given us a fairly accurate picture of the manner in which Nazi Germany is applying the principle of \"ec onomic collaboration\" to the \"occupied\" countries, and how, through her agents, she has seized control of all the great industries of France, Belgium and Holland. We have also seen how she ha s allowed the whole of her eco- nomic policy to be dictated by Dr. Schacht.

He believed that each nation owed it to itself to take advantage of every opportunity for imposing its will. Nations which allow such an opportunity to slip by deserve spoliation by their neighbors. \"A State,\" says Arndt, \"must first have a stable foundation, geographicall y speaking, and develop fur- ther according to rules of chance, and by virtue of its own character. The only restrictions laid down for the State are those of climate and surrounding territories. Yes, each State has the right to make strong representations to its neighbors, should the latter unjus tly seize air and light necessary to its growth and development.\" Arndt expresses himself \"euphe mistically\" about a point of view which might appear too brutally direct to a section of the public. Hitler, who commits th e gravest injustices in the name of \"justice\" and \"equality of rights,\" has drawn excellent inspiration from Arndt's methods. His \"Lebensraum\" is a mask for the simple will-to-conquer, as was Arndt's \"right (for each State) to make strong repres entations to its neighbors should the latter unjustly seize air and light necessary to its growth and development.\" It is evident too that in speaking of \"each State\" Arndt had Germany, and particularly Prussia, in mind. We shall see what a great influence the Teutonic Knights of the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had on the evolution of the Germany we know. It is natural for a man who thinks like Arndt to say that because Poland did not manage to put to rout or destroy the Teutonic Knights, she no longer had the right to exist.

Sooner or later she must disappear . . . \"According to our conception of things, small nations must disappear because geographically they rarely possess the means for subsistence. \"The natural frontiers of Pola nd were assaulted by Prussia, Courland and Livonia; and this in jury was certainly the main cause of Poland's final political death.\" And Arndt adds: \"Today Holland constitutes the most glaring violation of Germany's natural frontier.\"* Defense Will Not Win a War It is not only the political and economic ideas of \"New\" Germany which were expressed mu ch earlier. In the realm of military tactics also, all the German principles now described as \"new\" were discussed in de tail over thirty years ago by * The following words, no less significant;, are quoted from another work of Arndt, Spirit of the Times (Geist der Zeit): \". . .

He will quickly achieve this result by attacks on your flank, espe- cially if his forces are greater. \"I must boldly assert—although this principle may be new —that defensive wars should never be waged: as soon as pos- sible the role of aggressor s hould be assumed, and operations conducted against the enemy's flank and rear.\" Von Buelow also clearly formulated the ideas underlying the penetration—now a sad reality—by the Fifth Column into democratic countries, including creation of \"economic allies\" in enemy countries in the persons of a few great industrialists to whom economic advantages ar e promised. This system gave Germany excellent results in the conquest of France, and before America's entry into the war she tried to employ similar methods in the United States as well. In the writings of von Buelow are anticipated all the advantages which Ger- many's masters later gained in several countries by carrying on a campaign of corruption of the enemy at home. \"Insofar as everything has its price,\" says von Buelow, \"the amount of money available is al so a decisive factor. Greed for gain is so irresistible that one may buy materials of war even in enemy countries when th ey are not available at home ... to say nothing of the advantage possessed by the wealthier for succeeding in their purposes through bribery and corruption. On this subject Montecuccoli has already said: 'To wage war, three things are necessary. . . . Money, Money, and Money.'\""},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"20 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The \"Ideal Prussian\" In reviewing briefly the theories of a few German writers of the past 150 years, we wish ed merely to emphasize that ideas generally attributed to Hitler and Nazism originate from much earlier sources. For these very writers (and we might have cited many more at the risk of becoming repetitious) have only formulated principles underlying a curious \"cultural trend,\" generally described as \"Prussianism,\" but never clearly defined. Taken individually, such texts, frequently cited be- fore the World War, were regard ed as characteristic fantasies of slight significance, springing from that \"Prussian insolence\" about which nothing could be done. Related to each other, and related chiefly to the future (which has since become the present) and the past, those text s assume new significance, and we are obliged to attribute equal, if not greater, importance to them than to Mein Kampf. We will frequently deal with the origins and purposes of \"Prussianism\" in this book. We a ttribute to this word a mean- ing much wider and reaching much further back in time than that of most writers—for whom Frederick II, King of Prussia, is the prototype, if not the actual founder of Prussianism. Frederick II, while in many ways an extremely interesting per- sonality, and one of the most im portant forces in the rise of Prussia, was, however, only one of many in a long line of men formed by the Prussian school. Besides, this close friend of Voltaire was much too strongly tinged with humanitarianism to be considered an ideal representative of the school which is fundamentally opposed to humanitarian ideas. That a number of his actions can be explained only by the inspiration he received from the Prussian tradition does not alter this fact. Frederick II was unquestionably a great Prussian, but an imperfect Prussian, much as was Bismarck, that other great Prussian, who has often mistak enly been described as the greatest Prussian statesman of modern times—mistakenly be-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE CONSPIRACY AND ITS MIRROR 2 1 cause, even though Bismarck did render tremendous service to the Prussian cause, his attitude did not always please the high priests of Prussianism. Having conquered France, he attempted to live at peace with her. He limited Germanic am- bitions in the Balkans. He opposed his own country's tend- encies toward colonial expansion. Although many of his acts were in harmony with the purest precepts of the Prus- sianism of Arndt, List, and von Buelow, Bismarck retained a certain restraint and a trace of respect for Christian ethics— the opposite of Teutonic ethics (as described by several authors quoted). Thus Bismarck cannot be considered an ideal Prussian. This ideal Prussian, this man of \"Prussian dreams\" (which, in previous centuries, would have been cal led \"Teutonic dreams\") does exist, however, and is none other than Hitler. Here one must search for the secret of his success among his compatriots, who, for centuries have been awaiting a kind of Teutonic Messiah, who would ruthlessly achieve an ideal definitely opposed to conceptions of Christian and humani- tarian morality. Constantin Frantz, German writer of the nineteenth cen- tury, refers in one of his books to a little known work by Bollmann entitled Justification of Machiavellism. He says: \"The contents of this book are worthy of its title. What Machiavelli once claimed for Italy is applied here to Germany. The writer considers all small political parties powerless; and he hopes for an armed reformer who, with blood and iron, shall unite Germany, and to whom anything shall be per- mitted provided he attain the proposed goal. Powerful and of irresistible attraction, this man will know how to accomplish such a task.'' Frantz tries hard to apply this prophetic description to Bis- marck, but does not Hitler fi t this picture much more ac- curately than Bismarck? Besides, the ideal of a man devoting himself exclusively to the German cause, to whom \"anything"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2 2 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY shall be permitted\" is much older than Bollmann's prediction, and even older than the \"Prince\" of Machiavelli, to whom Bollmann and Frantz credited this figure. This is the \"man\" of whom Heine spoke (see pa ges 337-40): \"the man whom the German people await, the man who will bring to them the life and happiness they have so long hoped for in their dreams.\" This is a purely Teutonic conception, as we shall see, at least 700 years old. In the course of centuries it has had numerous ramifications, so that it has become rooted in the spirit and subconscious mind of the German people. Later it was considered a Prussian conception. Small wonder, then, that Hitler in his uncompromising brutal attitude of the \"sav- age ideal\" should have evoked such response in the hearts of the Germans. Prussians by Adoption The fact that Hitler is not Prussian by birth does not pre- vent his being the \"ideal Prussi an.\" The most ardent Prussians were not born in Prussia, for Pru ssianism is first of all a state of mind and a special way of th inking shaped over centuries, and to which men of diverse or igins have felt strongly at- tracted. We have seen that Treitschke, that fervent Prussian, was by birth part Saxon and part Czech. Fichte, who placed his philosophy at the service of Prussianism, also came from Saxony. Hegel, another great ph ilosopher who recognized his \"ideal State\" in Prussia, was south-German by birth, and Houston Chamberlain, famous theorist of the Prussian school, was of English origin. Hitler's Prussian inclinations were not restricted to the realm of theory. He opened the way to power for himself in 1932 and 1933 when, with the help of von Papen, he con- cluded an effective alliance with the powerful Prussian forces directing Germany's affairs unde r various guises.

While Nazism, as a truly dema gogic movement in its early days in Munich, was making noisy attacks on all existing power, including the power of Berlin, it provided a certain spiritual nourishment to thousands of frustrated German souls, who appreciated such talk. But from the day when Hitler con- cluded his alliance with the Pr ussian Junker leaders, Nazism became a front for Prussianism and entered into systematic planning for conquest of world power. From that time on, Nazism became a most threaten ing reality for all other coun- tries. We must, however, never forget the forces hiding be- hind this movement, forces whic h we shall attempt to expose. Prussia Ueber Alles Christianity, and humanitarianism which it inspires, believe in the supremacy of the human personality and the \"Rights of Man.\" All Western ethics are base d on this belief. Prussianism, however, admits only the supremacy of the State, to which it demands absolute submission of the individual, at the expense of his liberty, his private interests and his personal well being. General von Bernhardi summarized this idea thus: \"There is, as Fichte has taught us, but one virtue, to forget about oneself as a person; and but one vice; to think of oneself. In the final analysis, the State is bearer of all culture, and as such she has the right to claim for herself the individual strength of her citizens.\" According to the Prussian theory, the State itself is nothing but power, and the individual must do everything to contrib- ute toward the infinite increas e of this power. No attempt is made to define the State, nor to explain why it has the right to this absolute submission of its citizens. The theory is offered as a sort of dogma, belief in which forms the very essence of Prussian welfare."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"24 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY States are forged by the fire and blood of wars of conquest. Great and powerful countries gain possession of the weak, and these weak countries can only disappear. War, conse- quently, is not only inevitable, but forms the very basis of the State's ethics. For specialists in Prussian theology the validity of reasons for which wars are waged does not matter. They readily admit that wars waged by Prussian kings may have had no legal bases. What matters is that these wars contributed to territorial gains and increased Prussian power. Christian morality, fundamental to legal concept, may be tolerated for private relationships, and for maintaining social equilibrium, but as for the State itself, the latter determines its own ethical laws. Under the cloak of this \"ethics of the State,\" everything which according to traditional moral conceptions would be severely condemned, is excusable and even laudable if it is done in the interests of the Stat e; broken pledges, alliances and friendships negated, treaties disregarded, and whatever is con- sidered a \"lie\" by ordinary human beings. The entire tech- nique later applied by Hitler, which is ably analyzed by Francis Hackett and by Raoul de Roussy de Sales in their works based on Mein Kampf and Hitler's speeches, had already been outlined by this school of thought. The evidence offered by authors of the Prussian school to support their contention that Prussia, more than any other country, merits such an impressi ve future is extremely vague. Often the evidence is of a cultural nature; they attempt to demonstrate that Prussia (or \"Germany,\" understood as a Ger- many dominated by Prussia) could contribute much more to world civilization than any other country. But most often, instead of proof, a sort of \"r ealistic philosophy\" is suggested as sufficient: Prussia has know n how to extend her domain through victorious wars at the expense of other nations; therefore she seems to have been chosen by Providence to con- tinue in this direction.

Without such a sim ilarity of moral views it is impossible to achieve any international stability whatsoever. Religions, and the schools of philosophy which they have inspired, have successfully brought the leading nations of the world to a more or less co mmon moral denominator. From this angle, Christianity is not in sharp conflict with Moham- medanism, Buddhism, and Brahmanism. Prusso-Teutonism and the Fehme The Catholic Church at first, then Lutheranism, performed the task of ethical education in Germany too. It can hardly be said that the masses of the German people are influenced by the moral teachings of religion to a lesser degree than other nations. But separate from the \"Christian\" moral influence— which still carries weight with large portions of the German population—two distinct developm ents are discernible. These derive from a very different, much more primitive moral con- cept, barbarous from one point of view and in any case pre- Christian. To say that these two developments stem from pre-Christian ethics may on the surface seem contradictory, for both arise in direct line from organizations of a definitely religious char- acter. The Prusso-Teutonic tradition (or briefly \"Prussian- 26"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 2 7 ism\") originates directly from the religious Order of Teutonic Knights, and the \"Fehmic\" tradition is derived from the notorious Fehme,* the blood- tribunal of the Middle Ages, which had definite ties to the church. But centuries have elapsed since both organizations discarded all their religious characteristics. Immediately before the first World War, the problem of \"Prussianism\" was often subjected to the scrutiny of the world and was held responsible for German ambitions of that period. Feeling the danger, the Prussian group acted according to time-honored principles for outwitting savage animals: \"If you are without a we apon and fear the lion, lie down and play dead.\" The trick succeeded, and it is currently believed that the old \"Prussian\" or \"junker\" menace has practically died out since Hitler's accession to power in Germany.** It is ex- tremely important that we penetr ate this camouflage. It is not only useful to reveal the connection between Prussianism and present-day Germany; it is equally useful to show clearly the roots from which Prussianism originated in history long before Frederick II of Prussia and the Great Elector. Only by under- standing what these roots were can we appreciate what pres- ent-day Germany really is. Prussianism, in its usual interpretation, hangs in the air. Isolated from its past and from its present, it represents nothing more than an historical curiosity with no direct significance for our times.

The principal events in Germany between the two World Wars, the reasons for Hitler's rise to power and the events that followed can be understood only by a thorough scrutiny of the Prusso-Teutonic and Fehmic organizations. This should enable us also to understand better the connections between various writers—\"theologians of Prussianism,\" a few of whom we have cited—and the motives which were sufficiently pow- erful to make them unanimously adopt an attitude in the question of morals which our moral sense, faithful to tradition, strenuously rejects. The Rulers of Prussia Before we go back to the origins of the Prusso-Teutonic conspiracy we may recall that the \"Germany\" we know is not the same as the Empire which bore this name until 1806. That Empire was composed of a number of little States whose principles of government were almost all similar to those of other European States and w hose ethical doctrines were essentially Christian. In the second half of the nineteenth century a remarkable manoeuvre was effected. Prussia, one of these States (the only State whose principles were profoundly different from those of other German and foreign States), succeeded in imposing her rule—at first in 1866 over the other North German States, and in 1870 over every German State except Austria. This two-fold manoeuvre, carried out in first-rate Machiavellian fashion, allowed Prussia to i ndoctrinate all Germany with her principles.

From 1870 Germany, ruled by the Prussians, assumed the role of a Great-Prussia, although her \"Prussianization\" had only been partly com- pleted. Despite the Prussian influence, a number of traditional German elements had been pres erved throughout the country. It was now a question of maki ng the whole Reich accept the idea widely propagated by nineteenth-century Prussian the- oreticians: that Germany could not achieve prosperity except by imposing her will, through unceasing conquest, upon other countries. World peace, that age- old dream, could be attained only by creating a unified world under German rule. To reach this goal—a world under German rule—any method would be acceptable. The favored met hod for effecting this expan- sion was by bloody wars, deliberately started, and so ruthless that, according to the Prussian theory, the transformation would be all the more lasting. Bismarck was the man who accomplished total seizure of all Germany by Prussia. Although of the same turn of mind as other Great-Prussians, he felt that any plan for expansion must be applied slowly and pr ogressively. Guided by oppor- tunistic considerations he introduced a parliamentary system into Prussia and Germany, which satisfied the masses, even though he personally was opposed to representative govern- ment. His friends, whose spokesman he was, were even more opposed to this than Bismarck—but they knew that behind this facade of representativ e government the real power would remain in their hands, if they proceeded wisely.

However, its legacy of a mighty Prussia, and the Order's basic idea of con- spirational community remains a sacred duty for us today.\" The Prusso-Teutonic organizations of the twentieth cen- tury and \"Prussian spirit\" in general stem directly from the Teutonic Knights of the twelfth century. This religious order, founded at Acre, Syria, in 1190, during the time of the Crusades, from its beginning was distinguished from the two other orders of knights of the Holy Land, the Templars and the Knights of St. John (known later as the Knights of Malta), by its strictly national, or rather racial, character. In order to join the Teutonic Knights, one had to prove pure German ancestry (noble ancestry , of course), whereas mem- bership in the Templars or th e Knights of St. John was open to nationals of any country.* Ne vertheless there was a definite preponderance of Latins in the membership of these two orders. As a reaction against this, the German Crusaders decided to found a hospital of their own in the Holy Land, reserved exclusively for German Knights who were sick or wounded. A few years later, in 1198, this organization was changed into a Knights' Order. King Philip of Swabia rook it under his patronage in 1206; the Germano-Roman Emperor Otto IV did the same in 1213. From this time on the organi- zation may be considered as a purely German political instru- ment of the highest importance. * At the beginning of the nineteenth century anyone wishing to enter the Teutonic Order had to prove that eight paternal and eight maternal ancestors were purely German.

It was inevi- table that rivalry should break out between these two powers, each of which in the eleventh century considered itself supreme. The Emperors, who did not fail to recognize the spiritual influence of the Church, began to appoint Bishops without consulting the Pope. They even managed actually to get Popes appointed. Their opportunity came because the Church had been weakened by the human frailties of certain of its most prominent members. But the Church as an institution was to prove that it pos- sessed greater internal strength than the few weak men who had momentarily been at its head. Cardinals elected new Popes. They came from the grea t monastery of Cluny, whose influence on Christianity was very important. These Popes, men of Godly existence, restored to the Church its former glory, but only found themselves in greater conflict with the Emperors. Pope Gregory VII was determined to be free of the author- ity of the State. He proclaimed the spiritual sovereignty of the Papacy throughout the world and preached about St. Augus- tine's \"Kingdom of God on Earth\"; he denied the claims of the German \"Holy-Roman\" Empe rors to world rule in a material sense. Emperor Henry IV, of the Franconian line of Emperors (ancestors of the Hohenstaufens through maternal lineage), claimed sovereignty by divine right over mankind and the earth. This resulted in bitter conflict, and in 1076 the Pope excommunicated the Empe ror, who came in 1077 to humble himself before the Pope at Canossa.

Gregory had already spoken in vague terms of a mighty armed pilgrimage to reconquer Jerusalem. Now Ur ban again took up the idea, and in Italy, Normandy, and Provence, preached the cause of \"God's Expedition.\" He felt certain that if he succeeded in launching such a holy campaign under the banner of St. Peter, he would be striking a telling blow at Gilbert and the Em- peror, and the prestige of the Church would thus be restored. Slowly the idea took shape, Crusader troops were organized all over Europe, and finally a speech by Urban to the Cler- mont conclave loosened the human avalanche which set out toward the Holy Land. The First Crusade was born! The triumphal march of this army across Italy was sufficient to drive the anti-Pope from Rome without a struggle, and Urban again had possession of the Lateran Palace. The prestige of the Emperor suffered a heavy blow. Now that the Pope had regained a ll his rights, Henry's excommuni- cation was everywhere regarded much more seriously than before.

During this time two Knights' Orders, born of the Crusades, were founded in the Holy Land: the Templars and the Hos- pital Knights of St. John, both having their seat at Acre in Syria. Both these orders can from that time on be regarded as armies of the Pope the lack of which had previously been a serious shortcoming to the Papacy . It is therefore not astonish- ing that the German Emperors should have tried to neutralize these forces. It is quite probable that they were influenced by considerations of this kind when they supported the formation of the purely German-armed Or der of the Teutonic Knights. Imperial Monks A skillful manoeuvre: to allow establishment of a Knights' Order, at first of solely religious appearance and with but vague ties to the Empire, so th at it would have the consecra- tion by the Pope indispensable to its prestige. It was not until a few years later, when its existence was quite secure, that the Teutonic Order more openly put itself at the service of the Imperial plans for expansion. Hermann von Salza, Grand Master of the organization from 1210 to 1239, was primarily responsible for the profound impulse of the Order in this direction, and he may be con- sidered its true founder in a political sense. From the time of his accession to power he realized that the Teutonic Knights were, in the Holy Land, in direct competition with the other two older and more respected Kn ights' Orders. It was there- fore preferable for the Teutonic Order to turn toward other lands in order to secure actu al conquests.

The territory reserved for the Order was clearly defined in a written agreement drawn up between the King and Grand Master. Nevertheless Andrew s oon made the complaint that the Knights were widely tres passing beyond the borders out- lined for them, that they were coining money without author- ity, and, finally, ha d so cleverly manoeuvred at Rome that the Pope had consented to take th e territory occupied by them directly under his protection. This allowed the Knights to consider this territory no longer subject to King Andrew. Heinrich von Treitschke, though well disposed toward the Teutonic Knights, founders of the Prussianism he holds dear, states that they acted in Burzenland \"in that spirit of ruthless egotism, fully conscious of its strength, which, from this point on, characterized the statesmans hip of the Order.\" Von Treit- schke obviously meant this as a compliment, although he describes the Knights as \"dange rous friends\" for the King of Hungary. The latter in 1225, having early perceived the danger, hastened to expel these \"friends\" from his country, before they had time to become too powerful. But we can recognize here, from von Treitschke's frank description, the first evidence of certain traits which have survived to this day among the contemporary desc endants of the Teutonic Knights.

Hermann von Salz a was very devoted to him, frequently, acting as his intermediary with the Pope. When in 1226 he discovered a new land, conquest of which might compensate for his humiliating defeat in Hungary, he immedi- ately turned to Frederick II, and placed the campaign he was about to undertake under his patronage. Hermann von Salza managed to have conveyed to Conrad of Masovia, Christian Duke of Poland, the idea that the Teu- tonic Knights might give him valuable assistance in his battles against heathen tribes. Among thes e tribes the Slavic Borus- sians (Prussians) were most fa mous. Bishop Christian, a Ber- nardine monk settled as a missionary within the borders of Borussia, acted as intermediary for the Order. It was he who, believing in the sincerity of the Knights, mentioned them to the Duke. Early in 1226 a formal invitation from Conrad arrived at the Order. Von Salza consulted Frederick II at once and the latter, in his Bull of Rimini, entrusted von Salza with an imperial \"mission\" for his future campaign. A Charter for Future Action This Bull,* which doubtless revealed but a minor part of the agreement between the two men (the part which might safely be made public) was the ve ry basis for all future action of the Teutonic Knights; a permanent charter for all Prussian conquest, and all German political expansion which, during centuries to come and until this day, was to radiate from that territory. The uncompromising spirit with which the Teutonic Order pursued its aim sprang from the \"imperial mission\" which was entrusted to the Order in this Bull.

It was this Bull which launched the Order on the path of conquest against *See complete text of the Bull, page 363."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"36 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Slavic countries—but its full scope exceeded by far this par- ticular conquest. In the Bull of Rimini, the Emperor described himself \"by the merciful tenderness of God\" head of the Empire \"erected before the Kings of the August Earth.\" He asserted that God has \"extended the limits of our power throughout the various zones of the world.\" The reason (or rather the excuse) given to justify this claim was the \"preaching of the Gospel.\" (The Holy See often violently opposed, in the time of Fred- erick II as in the time of his predecessors, such claims of the Germano-Roman Emperors to world rule, and refused to admit that the pretext of a religious mission justified such purposes. This is in fact the ve ry origin of the secular con- flict between Popes and Emperors, and the reason for excom- munication of several Emperors, including Frederick II.) Fur- ther Frederick specified that his mission of Empire was di- rected \"not less to subjugati on than to conversion of the people\"; which makes still more apparent a preponderance of imperialistic ambitions. This phrase, moreover, is a clear indi- cation of the methods by which the Order was to carry out the imperial mission entrusted it by the Bull. The Bull states that in this spirit and by virtue of the invita- tion of Duke Conrad of Masovia (whom the Emperor calls \"noster Cunradus,\" consequendy his vassal) the Teutonic Order is charged with conquering the territory described (in- tentionally, no doubt) in very vague terms: a land known as the \"Land of Culm\"; another country situated between the borders of the Duke's land and those of the Prussians (Borus- sians); and finally the Prussian country itself. Elsewhere the Bull adds that, besides the right of conquest in the territories conceded by the Duke of Masovia and in the Prussian country, the Order shall enjoy \"the old and due imperial rights over mountains, plains, rive rs, forests and seas\" (velut vetus et de- bitum ius imperii in montibus, planicie, fluminibus, nemoribas et in mari)."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS  37  The Bull further confirms that all territory conquered or received as a gift fay the Order shall belong to it entirely, with all the rights and privileges of a sovereign imperial prince, in- cluding the right to levy taxes and duties, coin money, exploit all sorts of mines, name judges, impose te rritorial laws, etc. German historians of the Teut onic Order note with satisfac- tion that by this Bull the Order was provided for a long time ahead with a broad plan of action. Indeed the terms of the Bull were so generally drawn that any future activity of the Order, regardless of its nature, would come under the special patron- age of the Emperor, and would be supported by him. On the other hand, the Order was henceforth to be bearer of the mission of expansion, which, according to Carolingian tradi- tion, was the very essence of Empire. \"A Paraphrase of the Real Goals\" The campaign on the Polish border did not begin until 1231, after long preparation, five years after Frederick II, the Em- peror who dreamed of world dominion, had given the Order an impetus which was to keep its full force for many centuries. The Duke of Poland was bitterly to regret inviting the Teu- tonic Knights into his country. The Bernardine Bishop Chris- tian was to share these regrets at having suggested the idea to Conrad, for later he was kidnapped, imprisoned and cruelly tortured by the Borussians, whom he suspected of acting with the encouragement of the Knights. The cynicism of the Order, which was to remain unchanged over the centuries, was evident here in all its st rength. The Knights began the campaign with the firm resolve to keep for their Order ex- clusively all conquered territory, and to extend their con- quests far beyond the lands of Culm and Prussia (where lived the wild Borussians, a heathen Slavic race), their first goal, and object of the agreement with Duke Conrad.

The Emperors, fully aware of the enormous spiritual power of the Church, always found it convenient (even at the time of their most violent conflicts with the Papacy) to maintain this religious front in order to make their imperialistic ambi- tions appear legitimate. Frederick II, while under excommuni- cation, left for a Crusade to the Holy Land, despite opposition by the Pope, so that he might prove to the world that he was leading the struggle against the heathen. This \"struggle against the heathen\" was, for the Ge rmano-Roman Emperors, what the \"struggle against Jews and Communists\" is for Hitler to- day—a pretext, and a most transparent one. The German writer Hans Krieg, whom we mentioned be- fore, writing in 1939 (i.e., when the Nazi regime was already in full flower) acknowledges defi nitely that conversion of the heathen was only a screen and that actually the Order was concerned with increasing the territory of the \"Reich.\" \"Con- version of the heathen Prussians was a contemporary para- phrase of the real goals—a paraphrase adapted to those times.\" Krieg does not attempt to deny the duplicity of such an atti- tude, without describing it as such, but adds that in view of the \"grandiose vision of the whole\" pursued by the Order the methods employed did not matter much. Krieg uses a modern expression very familiar to us , when he describes the true mission of the Order: \"increase of German living space\" (\"Lebensraum\"). He does not fail to state moreover, with-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 39 out going into detail, that \"the Teutonic Order has transmitted this mission as a legacy to the Germany of today.\" Frederick Bequeaths His Imperial Ambitions Emperor Frederick If who, w ith Hermann von Salza, was responsible for the Teutonic Knights' great adventure into Prussia, was one of the queerest men of the Middle Ages. Son of Henry VI and grandson of Fr ederick Barbarossa, he felt responsible for carrying out his forefathers' inordinate ambi- tions. The title \"dominus mundi \" proudly borne by his grand- father awakened powerful res ponses in his highly mystical soul. His most ardent desire seems to have been to continue this tradition and maintain it for posterity, and this desire dictated all his acts and decisions. He finally came to realize that the violent opposition of the Pope would doubtless not permit him to pursue his scheme for imperial expansion and pe rpetual conquest by direct means. He decided therefore to use the Teutonic Knights by charging the Order with an imperial mission suiting his own purposes. Thus a double advantage was achieved. He suc- ceeded in covering up his real ambitions by having them car- ried out by a so-called religious Order under the pretext of \"converting the heathen.\" Even the Pope who had excom- municated him could not criticize such activity. Besides in bequeathing his schemes to an Or der following strict monastic rules which assured its permanence, he could hope that his intentions would be carried out not only during his lifetime, but in future times as well. Frederick had had ample opportunity to get a clear idea of the power acquired by the two other Knights' Orders, the Templars and the Knights of St. John. He understood that their strength lay in their rigid organization, the strictness of their rules, and also in what was known as their \"secret.\" The \"secret\" of religious Orders of the Middle Ages was a power-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY ful motive which insured absolute devotion of the members to the purposes pursued. It was not so much the content of this secret which mattered (although it usually bore, at least sym- bolically, some relation to th e real designs of the Order). What mattered was the vety existence of a secret. Men bound by a common secret, subject to the same vow of silence on certain questions, were likely to devote themselves more ardently and with steadier zeal to the common cause, than if they were bound by purely rational obligations, devoid of mystery. Modern society has greatly neglected this helpful factor, so very important in the Middle Ages and ancient times. Frederick II, whose mystical soul divined what he could expect from the closed organization of an Order built on mystic vows and a secret, firmly intended to use them in carry- ing out his plans. Both rules and organization of the Teutonic Order had been copied from those of the Templars. The Templars had a secret (although it is unlikely that its content was as mal- odorous as certain witnesses claimed during the famous trial instituted against them early in the fourteenth century by Philippe le Bel—the trial which was to end in the annihilation of this Order). Both Templars and Hospitalers, aside from their own leaders recognized onl y God and the Pope as their masters. Frederick repeatedly found himself in difficulty with both Orders, and especially with the Templars. For his tastes, they were too devoted to the interests of the Papacy, with which he was in constant conf lict. He therefore deemed it profitable to do everything possible to fortify the position of the Teutonic Order, on which he could depend ever since his close alliance with Hermann von Salza had been concluded. He knew that the Teutonic Orde r, apparently a religious Order like the other two Knight s' Orders, was much more devoted to him than to the Pope and could be safely con- sidered the faithful heir of his ambitions. Can these \"ambitions,\" these \"i ntentions,\" be described as"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 41 peculiarly \"German\"? In the thirteenth century the word had a meaning different from what it has for us. Frederick II was German only on his father's side. His mother was Constance of Sicily, and the education he received in his own youth was much more Sicilian than German. He was a sort of Renais- sance figure—before the Renai ssance. But Frederick, in achieving his imperialistic plans, had met with more difficulties in Italy than in Germany. A lthough the German princes were often not easy to handle, he still had a greater hold on the German nobles than on the Italian. In view of this, the Teu- tonic Order, which was an organization of German noblemen, was able to bring him valuable help—especially because of his sincere friendship with the Order's Grand Master. Thence- forth he could consider the Tectonic Knights the dependable force on which he might rely. Because of the instability of imperial power, Frederick had had every reason to strengthen as much as he could the position of the Order. It is because of this that he elevated it to the rank of a State of the Empire— to make it the principal perfor mer of what he considered the imperial task. In reading the text of the Bull of Rimini, one may wonder whether the Emperor had not wished to grant the Order a certain independence from the Empire. This could be ex- plained by the fact that Frederick had been very uncertain regarding the immediate future of the Empire. One of his sons, Henry, whom he had had appoi nted \"King of Germany,\" had later revolted against him; Freder ick had been obliged to have him thrown into prison, where he died. His other sons did not appear to have much strength or promise. He had therefore no way of knowing what family would occupy the throne of the Empire in future generations. Frederick must have realized that his own family, and an Empire poorly consolidated, w ould offer fewer guarantees for continuance of his imperial am bitions than would a rigidly organized Order with which he had spiritual ties. It is not sur-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"42 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY prising, then, that he should ha ve assigned such an important role to the Teutonic Order, both in the Bull of Rimini and by his subsequent aid. He must have experienced a kind of satisfaction in seeing his task pursued by an Order to which he had brought real life by giving it a raison d'etre. This satis- faction can be compared to that felt by the modern industrial- ist who bequeaths his concern to his employees. But Freder- ick II was a mystic (which modern industrialists rarely are), and must therefore have felt a satisfaction all the greater when he thought of the influence he was exerting on the future through the medium of the Order. Frederick II cannot be considered a \"German Nationalist\" according to modern terminology. The Germanic racial char- acter of the Teutonic Order charged with execution of his schemes was secondary to the Emperor, cosmopolitan par excellence. The Order had been organized according to Ger- man racial laws before it became associated with Frederick. These racial laws were likewise class laws, for it was necessary to belong to a noble German family to be admitted to the Order. Frederick had no reason to wish to change the Order's purely \"noble German\" aspect, for this contributed greater unity to the organism. But aside from such considerations, the problem of German nationalism did not concern the Em- peror at all. In the Bull of Rimini, Frederick describes himself at the beginning and the end as \"Emperor of the Romans, King of Jerusalem and of Sicily.\" He makes no mention of German countries anywhere in the Bull. The continuation of the an- cient Roman Empire was part of his mystical vision of life, and purely German traditions meant nothing to him. He longed to be \"dominus mundi,\" Lord of th e Earth, for to be a German Emperor seemed to him, under Carolingian tradition, too restricted a task.

These tradi- tions were necessarily distinct from all other German tradi- tions, and it was inevitable that at some time in later centuries a struggle should arise betw een the two traditions. Antichrist? While still a young man, Frederick had hoped to accom- plish the greater part of his colossal ambitions during his own lifetime. Fedor Schneider, in a lecture given at the University of Frankfort (published in the 1930 collection of Frankfurter Universitaetsreden) says with regard to this: \"Frederick's program of impe rial politics was completely formed by the time he was a bout twenty. The first objective would be an absolute and thorough centralization of the King- dom of Sicily, the Norman State of his ancestors. Through the strength thus gained in Sicily he might reconquer Italy (which Barbarossa previously had conquered and lost) acquir- ing control over more territory even than Barbarossa. Then, using all Italy as a base, the Em peror planned not only to re- establish his imperial authority in Germany, but to strive for world dominion in the spirit of Henry IV.\" The plans formed by Frederick in his youth were extremely idealistic. He dreamed of an empire of justice, of world peace. We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of his interest in these objectives. His extremely wide culture helped to make him both visionary and tolerant. He was very active in the study of natural history and contributed considerably to the development of medical science in Italy. In 1224 he founded the University of Naples, and also enlarged the medical school at Salerno. He spoke six langua ges: Greek, Latin, Italian, Ger- man, French and Saracen. He wrote poetry in the most varied and difficult meters. He surrounde d himself with poets, scien- tists and artists. He collected works of art and had a magnifi-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"44 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY cent library. He was also know n for his tolerance towards Mohammedans and Jew. In his youth he appeared to be a faithful son of the Church. Moreover he owed his election as Emperor to the sponsorship of the Pope. But his faith was not to evolve along very ortho- dox lines, and he was often accused of scepticism with regard to Church doctrine. He was much interested in astrology and the occult sciences which he ha d learned from the Saracens in Sicily, the home of his mother. With age he showed more and more independence with respect to the Church, and set a price on his obedience. The conflict became increasingly sharp, and Frederick was finally excommunicated. Frederick's struggles with the Pope and the Italian cities revived the old conflict between \"Guelfs\" and \"Ghibellines.\" The Guelfs supported both the Papacy and the idea of free- dom. They composed the party of the \"Rights of man\" of that period: their political doctrines harmonized with the Church's recognition of the sacred charact er of the human person. The Ghibellines were followers of the Hohenstaufens, who fa- vored strong centralized power—a nd absolute imperial power. Here the popular Christian ideal struggled against the ideal of an ever-expanding imperialism. The Guelfs came primarily from among the lesser nobility and the city bourgeoisie, while the Ghibelline idea took root among the high nobility. The Guel fs were named after the German family of Welf. The expression \"Ghibelline\" is an Italian corruption of the Germ an \"Waiblingen,\" which was the name of a Hohenstaufen castle. Welf I was a powerful noble at the time of Henry IV and received Bavaria from him as a fief. Later, as a result of the rivalry for the imperial throne, fierce hostility developed between the families of Welf and Hohenstaufen. The struggles ex tended to Italy, where the Hohenstaufens wished to rule with the same absolutism as in Germany. Both families had their ardent champions, recruited from among individuals of opposing schools of thought. The"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 45 origin of the rivalry was soon forgotten; but cleavage between the two camps remained, dividing the members according to their opposed mental attitudes. Partisans of Barbarossa and of Frederick II in their struggles against the Popes were recruited, naturally, from among the Ghibellines. Frederick spent the second part of his life struggling against the Lombard cities and the Papacy. From this time on he changed considerably. The idealism of his youth had de- parted. From now on he was a hard man who respected no- body and stopped at nothing. Hi s vision of world empire was no longer humanitarian. His sole concern now was the win- ning of absolute power at any price, in opposition to the Church's claim of spiritual domination over the entire world. It was then that he declared: \"From now on I shall be the hammer.\" His imperialistic ideas, of c ourse, aroused determined op- position from the Church. Until now the Church trusted him, forgetting that this was the grandson of the ambitious Freder- ick Barbarossa. Traits of Frederick's character, which he in- herited from Sicilian forebears on his mother's side, may have been misleading. Sicily was at that time the melting pot of the Mediterranean. There Greeks and Saracens had introduced their highly developed cultural traditions. Frederick's mixed blood is perhaps the very explanation of his contradictory nature. In the second phase of his life all the harshness of the Hohenstaufens characterized him. The description, \"Stupor mundi,\" applied in his youth in an admiring sense, now symbo- lized the terror which he inspired everywhere. His biographer, E. Kantorowi cz (in Kaiser Friedrich der Zweite—1928*), describes Frederick during this second phase of his life as follows: \"Attila's air surrounded him and he alone could keep on breathing it—just as it was Attila's mission which was now his, and which only he could comprehend. His contemporaries * The translation is my own from the German original."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"46 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY instinctively bestowed Attila's title, 'Scourge of the Peoples' and 'Hammer of the World' on him, and his followers no longer referred to him merely as 'he who rules over land and sea,' or 'he who makes the winds to rejoice,' but rather as 'he whose power tramples the mountains and bends them at will.* All Europe suffered terribly under him, both friend and foe alike, Italy and Germany in particular; and to those who did not worship him and were not his followers, Fred- erick now represented the very epitome of all evil. The capac- ity for evil possessed by Frederick was indeed rare in a ruler of his stature . . . nor has anyo ne taken gteater pleasure in doing evil. Where the State was concerned he had always been capable of any cruelty, treachery, violence, cunning, deceit, harshness—of any outrageous behavior. 'I have never reared a pig whose fat I would not eat' was one of his ex- pressions. But where previously he had committed evil for the sake of the State, now it was for its possible effect in the world struggle which went on around his person; and he alone had come to be the State. Where previously the needs of the State constituted right, now it was the Emperor's personal needs. What he required at the moment and what might be useful as a weapon were now considered right . . . and where, in the past, laws had been bent to the interests of the State and the world at large, they were now bent to suit imperial caprice. The theory that the welfare of the Empire, of other Kings and nations, and of those who believed in him depended on his personal weal or woe—was frequ ently proclaimed. Every act and move of his now seemed mo re tyrannical, more violent, more monstrous and in fact more ruthless, since it was useful only in the preservation of a single individual.\" Kantorowicz gives the followi ng description of the effect produced by Frederick on the minds of his contemporaries: \"The entire life of Frederick II can be interpreted in the Messianic as well as the Antichrist spirit. It was the common belief that the Antichrist begotten in sin, would be surrounded"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 47 by magicians and wizards, astrol ogers and sorcerers . . . and he would restore demon worship: he would strive for persona! fame and would call himself G od Almighty. He would come to Jerusalem and install his throne in the Temple ... he would restore the ruins of the Temple of Solomon and then, lying, claim to be the son of the Almighty. At first he would convert the Kings and Princes, and through them, later, the people. He would dispatch his couriers and preachers to all parts of the world, and his preaching, as well as his power, would reach from sea to sea, from east to west and from north to south. With him, however, the Roman Empire would come to an end. And he would accomplish signs and wonders and unheard-of deeds—but unpr ecedented confusion would reign over the Earth. For when his deeds were witnessed, even the perfect ones and God's chosen would doubt whether he were Christ—who, according to the Scriptures, will come again at the end of the world—or whether he were the Anti- christ. They would look like one another. . . . \"And Frederick's behavior always allowed for double in- terpretation. In his display of the exotic splendor of both his court and his menageri e, he might be cons idered by some as a universal King ruling over al l peoples and races—men and beasts—as the Messiah, under whose scepter all animals shall lie down together in peace . . . while others might have seen, in this galloping procession of pards and owls and dark-skinned Corybantes, sweeping through Italian cities, the very Hosts of the Apocalypse.\" Frederick II liked to trace his behavior to his grandfather, Frederick Barbarossa. It is quite possible that the legends at- tached to the latter largely influenced the dreams of his grand- son. Frederick II maintained for example that the Teutonic Knights had been founded by Ba rbarossa, a claim which seems to have no justification in fact. In the popular mind the legends inspired by Frederick's death fused with those which centered about his grandfather at an earlier time. When Fred-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"48 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY erick II died, people did not believe it: had it not been said that the Emperor would live to the age of 267 years? For almost a century after his death impostors pretended to be Frederick. In Italy it was said that he was not dead, but that he had retired inside Mount Aetna. A Franciscan monk told of having been deep in prayer along the edge of the sea, when he noticed a company of several horsemen disappearing with their mounts among flames into the water. One of these riders said to him: \"It is Emperor Frederick who is leading his Knights into Aetna.\" The German legend mentions Mount Kyffhaeuser as the refuge of Frederick and says that he will live there until he returns to lead his people. It was assumed that this refers to Frederick Barbarossa. It is probable that the story was told originally about Frederick II, and that this is one of those confusions of personalities which is common in all folk- lore. The mysticism of Frederick II, allied with that of Hermann von Salza, was behind the vast and daring imperial mission which had been assigned to the Order of the Teutonic Knights. Frederick bequeathed it all of his incontinent ambi- tions and all of his utilitarian ruthlessness. The Emperor's word, \"I have never reared a pig whose fat I would not eat,\" could have been the motto of the Order. Like its spiritual ancestor, it too was to become \"Hammer of the World\" and \"Scourge of the Peoples.\" And the description of Frederick II, —\"what he required at the mome nt and what might be useful as a weapon were now consid ered right,\"—can equally and unreservedly be applied to the Order. It was Frederick II who instructed the Order in the strict methods used by the Normans of Sicily in organizing the State. The Order's entire set-up of Knight-officials, which was to be the basis of the severe Prussian official system, sprang from there. In transmitting to the Order all the conceptions deriving from the second phase of his life , Frederick II was careful not"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 49 to bequeath to it any of the ideas and principles of his youth, which were marked by human itarianism and tolerance. Conversion as a Pretext The conversion and oppression of the Borussians by the Teutonic Knights were carried on by fire and sword. These Borussians were a savage people who knew how to make them- selves feared, but the Knight s opposed them with all their Teutonic harshness, the arrogance of their caste and the fanat- icism derived from their monastic origins—fanaticism strength- ened by severe rules and regulations inspired by those of the Templar Order.* A cruel campaign followed in which the Borussians were unable to resist the superior forces of the Order. By 1260 almost the entire territory of the Borussians had passed into the hands of the Order. Hermann von Salza died in 1239 and Frederick II in 1250, but their deaths did not change the course of events. The future paths of the Knights were all clearly defined; now, subjected to the strictest dis- cipline, they unswervingly pursued their task of conquest. The methods used by the Knights from the beginning of their campaign were severely criticized by contemporary chroniclers, most of whom were themselves German. This criticism was also taken up by the German clergy established in various sections of the Borussian territory, as well as the German missionaries belonging to non-armed orders. All of these deluged Rome with petitions complaining bitterly about the cruel and hypocritical beha vior of the Teutonic Order. One of their complaints was that the Knights had made abso- lutely no effort to convert the conquered peoples. On the con- trary, the Order hindered such conversion because as long as the heathen remained heathen, they could be considered as slaves: the Knights could exploit them at will, entirely for their own ends. *See page 231 for more details."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"50 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Modern German authors have no illusions as to the true ends pursued by the Order. The \"contemporary paraphrase of the real goals\" acknowledged by Hans Krieg is accepted by most German historians. Dr. Bruno Schumacher, in a work pub- lished in 1927 (Der Staat des deutschen Ordens in Preussen) described as follows the basic ideas governing the foundation of the Order's State: \"The first colonization of this land, cities used as military bases, and great land-grants made to people eligible for Knight service, seem to have been dict ated primarily by military con- siderations. This all became changed by 1283, when the con- quest was complete. Only now did the idea of a National State begin to take shape. A vigorous and systematic coloniza- tion of the land by German peasants was effected. At the same time this network of cities was extended—no longer for de- fense needs only but also for administrative purposes. . . . But the completion of this founding of a State was realized only with the acquisition of Pomerania-Minor. This Vistula land, which for a long time had be en within the range of East German colonization, was acquire d by dint of the greatest diplomatic skill, with the definite intention of using it as a connecting link to Germany. In this, there is not much of the spirit of the Crusades to be di scerned, but what does stand out strikingly is the foresighted political activity in the tradition of Hermann von Salza.\" August von Kotzebue, the fam ous German writer, did extensive research among the archives of the Order at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and published his find- ings in 1811, under the title, Preu ssens aeltere Geschichte. He claimed that he could find no evidence that these peculiar armed monks, the Knights, had ever attempted to preach the Christian religion. \"They want ed to conquer a land, not a people; establish dominion and not the teachings of Jesus. In this they took advantage of Europe's 'holy madness'.\" The \"holy madness\" of this period was the \"struggle against"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 51 the heathen.\" As already pointed out, with minor differences the Teutonic methods of the thirteenth and twentieth cen- turies are identical. The slogan of \"conversion of the heathen\" used by the Teutonic Knights assured them sympathy in different parts of the Christian world, despite the abuses of which they were accused by re spectable people. It also al- lowed them considerably to expand their forces through the constant influx of young warriors coming from all German countries. Actually it now became fashionable to participate in this crusade into the Borussian country—as it had formerly been to depart for the Holy Land at the behest of the Pope. In this, Frederick II and the shades of his ancestors who had survived in the Order's traditions won the advantage over the Pope. Although formally a religious order, the Teutonic Order pursued its own ends in accordance with the spirit of its imperial mission. And it went further. Having taken over the aims toward an imperium mundi of Frederick II and the Ger- mano-Roman emperors, the Order might be considered, fol- lowing Frederick's death, much more the spiritual successor to the limitless ambitions of this strange man and his predeces- sors than was the German Empire itself. The latter from now on lost much of its brilliance, and appeared in a less threatening light. Frederick II had been the last great Germano-Roman Em- peror, and the Hohenstaufen line died out with his son, who reigned but a few years. The German Emperors who followed them descended from other fami lies. They did not continue these Carolingian ambitions, and not one claimed the name of \"dominus mundi.\" The Order therefore regarded itself thence- forth not only as bearer, but also as sole heir of that mission which ithad been assigned by the Germano-Roman Emperors. And while the Christian spirit of \"Leben und leben lassen\" (\"live and let live\") was becoming widespread throughout the rest of Germany, the Order pursued its aims of perpetual"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"52 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY conquest with egocentric ruthle ssness, and later bequeathed them to the Prussian State. The Gratitude of the Order The Order extended its territory deeper and deeper into the Slav country until the fifteenth century. Those \"Prussians\" (Borussians) who did not submit were cruelly slaughtered. The \"collaborationists\" of this period were more or less safe, but in or der to gain the favor of their conquerors, they were forced to give up their native language. Finally their descendants inte rmingled with the conquerors. The Germanized Borussian nobility now married among the German \"beggar-noblemen\" (Be tteljunker) who had settled in the countries of the Order in the wake of the Knights. Together they were to form the Prussian junker caste, which has been referred to frequently. For the purpose of constantly extending their territory, the Knights, on the flimsiest of pr etexts, waged successive wars against all their neighbors, who, for the most part, were Chris- tian: the Lithuanians, the Sama ites, the Esthonians, the Rus- sians, the Pomeranians, the Krivitzians, and above all the Poles. After Prussia, Pomera nia-Minor was taken over, but the Order's conquests did not ha lt at this point. The Order did not, moreover, intend to st op at any point. The tentacles of the Teutonic squid reached out ever further with insatiable avidity. In the course of centuries the whole territory thus conquered became known as Prussia. Kotzebue, reliable historian of the Knights, described their intrigues in provoking war against the heroic Swantopolk, Christian Duke of Pomerania, so that they might seize his country. Swantopolk had rendered the Order great services. The Knights were never impresse d by such considerations, when the expansion of their territory was involved.

Thus, the Order excited the rage of the Duke, and through a series of incidents provoked a war with him—which was valuable in carrying forward their aims for conquest. Kotzebue relates that Swan topolk was under no illusions where the friendship he might expect from the Order was concerned: \"He could already foresee his future fate, observing that of the unfortunate Prussians [Borussians]. He knew that the Knights would never lack a pretex t, a Papal Bull or an imperial sanction when, after having succcssfuly subjugated the heathen, their insatiable lust might be attracted to the lands of the Pomeranian sovereign. Realizing this, he found it both prudent and just to support th e Prussians: prudent because their still unbroken power afforded him security; just, because the Order, in oppressing the Prussians, violated agreements of which he was the Trustee. \"Swantopolk was the son of Mest win, Duke of Pomerania, The dying father entrusted Sw antopolk with the guardianship of his younger brother, Sambor , and made Sambor swear to obey Swantopolk. The harmony between the two brothers was destroyed by the Order's intrigues. \"The Christian Order,\" says Kotzebue, \"knowing neither shame nor gratitude, provoked and armed brothers against one another, thus rewarding the unsuspecting Duke, who had welcomed and supported them w ith noble confidence. For it was Swantopolk's bravery alone that had saved the Germans from destruction on the banks of the Sirgune in 1233. For five years he remained their confederate (1238); would not make peace with the heathen without the Order's consent; even subjected himself to the Papal anathema rather than be unfaithful to them. He remained silent even when they be- friended his enemies—the Poles. \"But when the Order, disregarding the duties and oaths it"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"54 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY had taken, now reduced the unfor tunate Prussians to a state of socage, the latter, their arms enchained, turned to Swanto- polk, the trustee of their compact. He now felt that to remain silent any longer would be criminal (1239). But he did not yield hastily to an unruly desire for war; rather he wanted first of all to try everything to awaken a spirit of justice and humanity in the Order instead of shedding blood. In out- spoken fashion, and in a manner befitting a brave man and a mighty sovereign, he presente d himself before the 'Land- meister' (regional master) of the Knights as a spokesman for the oppressed. But the Landmeiste r, aloof and excitable, ac- cused the noble spokesman of being a traitor and of stirring up the populace. Swantopolk, alt hough angered, was above these personal insults and was guided simply by the interests of his followers. Even now he would not draw the sword; he was determined to exhaust every peaceful and legal means so that some day the curse and responsibility for having started a war would fall directly on the heads of the Knights. ... It was only when Sambor, the obdurate brother, built the citadel of Gordin (with aid from the Order) and turned it over to Swantopolk's enemies for their assemblies that Swantopolk drew the sword—not for conquest, but moved only by pru- dence and by human sympathy for the sufferings of the Prus- sians. \"The arrogant Knights had the impression that his only fol- lowers would be the Prussian masses, because the nobility had frequently caroused with them. But these nobles too, now become sober, recognized the new danger. They were still being handled with consideration, but what might they ex- pect after their people were thoroughly enslaved? For a long time their indignation had mount ed when they saw how unde- serving Germans were appointed to the principal offices and received large estates. They were no longer to be lured by revelry. They too were called to arms by the wails of the oppressed.\""},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 55 A long war ensued, terminating in the conquest of Pomer- ania by the Order. The methods used against Swantopolk are characteristic of the Teutonic Knights' behavior over a period of centuries. Pretexts were always found to provoke war against those princes whose lands they coveted. If such pretexts did not exist they managed to create them, so that responsibility for the ensuing conflict would always be placed on their adversaries. The Mania of Conquest Kotzebue describes the infernal urge toward perpetual con- quest in this manner: \". . . that shameful depravity, referred to where the hum- ble are concerned as greed, and, where the mighty, as the spirit of conquest: considered—in the first case—with univer- sal contempt; in the second with admiration by the petty . . . if that scourge of humanity spur s on some individual sovereign, it cannot take from the oppressed at least one comforting hope: that some day even the conqueror must die. But once this mania takes possession of an organism which never dies (because, in place of decaying extremities, it constantly shoots forth new ones) the ground, put to fire by its mania, becomes eternal Hell. Such a monstrosity was the German Order!

(This traditional seventy, a ggressiveness and intolerance of the Knight officials was carried over later in a direct line to the administration of the Prussian Kingdom.) Despite this inner severity a nd partly, perhaps, because of it, all sorts of abuses arose in the countries of the Order. The treatment to which the Kni ghts subjected the conquered people was, from the very beginning, most inhuman and led quite frequently to their seve re condemnation by the Holy See, which at times went so far as to place them under ban. Already in 1258 Pope Gregory IX bad written: \"The heathens were oppressed by no y oke before their darkness was illuminated by the torch of faith; yet despite this, the Brothers dare to steal the property and the freedom of those who are no longer sons of Ishmael but who have been redeemed through the blood of Christ. If they do not desist, they shall be deprived of their privileges and removed from the occu- pancy of the lands they have so abused.\" Kotzebue describes as follow s the oppression of the Krivit- zians by the Order: \"What fate was in store for the enslaved remnants of the once mighty Krivitz people? Where were their rulers, their nobles, their free-holders? What status, what rights and religion, what property would be theirs? They were treated in various manners by the vict ors. Prisoners, men, women and children, with no hope of clemency, were forced to submit to cruel bondage. The fact that they renounced Perkuna,* crossed themselves and sprinkled holy water on their heads, did not help them at all. It is true that the Order had taken the position in 1249 that all men are free and equal and that only unbelief leads to enslavement. Now, however, they man- aged to break their word through the vile pretext that only those who, of their own will, welcomed the cross and the beam on their shoulders might enjoy such privileges; but those who * The heathen god the Krivitzians worshipped."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 57 have been forced into the fold of the Church at the point of a sword must forever, and in slavery, atone for their past un- belief. \"Less miserable was the fate of those princes and nobles who had curried favor with the Order by betraying their father- land. These were granted estates which in many cases had belonged to them anyhow and which could not very well be stolen from those who, of their own free will, submitted. But where once they had been unrestrained masters of their es- tates, they now obtained as a special grant whatever greater or lesser jurisdiction they might have over their serfs and also the right—for both men and women—to inherit. For all this they were obliged to pledge themselves for Knightly serv- ice. If they were able to adjust themselves obediently under this new yoke, if they helped to draw the net even tighter around their own brothers, then the Order might occasionally condescend to give the rank of 'noble' to the nobles; to decorate the heroes with a Knight's sword; and in place of the traditional respectful title, 'Pan,' ('Sir') to bestow on them the empty title, 'Miles.' Whether they were also Christians was of no concern to these armor-clad missionaries.\" Trickery At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Gedemin, Lithuanian Prince, addressed hi mself to the Pope, demanding his protection against the Order. Kotzebue says that his letter shows up the \"black spirit\" of the Order: \"Gedemin wanted to become a Christian. The pious Knights attempted to hinder this, because for their own purposes of potential conquest, they would rather have his lands remain heathen territory.

Who would come to Prussia in the future, they concluded—with reason —and there submit to their excesses, if these people had been promised by a powerful ruler pe aceful shelter, protection, justice and liberty? To hinder this, the Knights had to utilize every means and practice every evil, if necessary. They had before disrespectfully broken the seal of the Grand Duke. Now they did not hesitate to intercept his letters, none of which, save those to Rome, ev er reached their destinations. So that posterity might some day recognize their cunning and give them credit for their knavish trickery, they were imprudent enough to file these letters in their archives instead of destroying them. As it is, these letters, after 600 years, are so many irrefutable witnesses against the Knights. \"In order to block the only secure road leading to Lithuania, they spread slanderous rumors to the effect that Masovia had been cruelly razed by Gedemin. Actually, Gedemin's letter described Duke Boleslas of Mas ovia as his only friend, through whose country one might safely travel in the pilgrimage to Lithuania. The difficulty with which letters were forwarded at this time made this knavery possible; and their slander even found its way into history. Such a circumstance appears less surprising when one takes into account the great number of lies officially set in motion, unhindered because no one dares to deny them—this even in our own times, despite all the means at our disposal for disseminating truth. \"Thus is posterity deceived. \"The letters addressed to the Pope were not intercepted by the Order, either because they did not dare to do so, or because their bearers escaped the Knights' vigilance. That the pagan Grand Duke, rather than the Pope's own warriors, sons of the Church and Knights of the Blessed Virgin, received the pro- tection of the Holy Father, is the best indication of how con- temptible was the Order's behavior.

The Teutonic Brothers forced them out of their churches. They imprisoned and poisoned Bishops . The peaceful German bour- geoisie who lived in the seaside towns and in the cities of the interior—where their ancestors had come in great numbers as artisans, at the invitation of the Order—also had plenty of cause to complain bitterly of the Order's corruption and im- morality. Fierce battles were waged at various times and notably in the fifteenth century, between the Order and the German city bourgeoisie, who organized in a Bund against the Knights. The bourgeoisie accused the Knights of crimes of all sorts. The most fundamental ri ghts were denied them by the Order, which was functioning as a theocracy, with absolute power. Expropriation and other material usurpation were common. Owners of land coveted by the Order were thrown into prison. Their wives and daughters were seduced by mem- bers of the Order, who did not take their own vows of chas- tity too seriously. H. Bauer (in Schwert im Osten, 1932) writes: \"In accordance with the original regulations of the Order, it was forbidden for a Knight to kiss even his mother or sister, but a common saying in Prussia now advised the head of the house to keep his back door locked against the Crusaders.\" Kotzebue found a vast amount of evidence in the archives of the Order which permitted him to establish the extent of the abuses committed. This is what he has to say concerning the morals of the Teutonic Knights in the fourteenth century: \"Robbery and murder were every-day occurrences in Prus- sia, particularly on the borders, along whose reaches cries and complaints could be heard ceaselessly.

Some of the Superiors of the Order were themselves powerful robbers who would spare none of their neighbors. When complaints reached the ears of the Grand Master, his answer was invari ably: 'We don't know anything about it' or 'We are really sorr y.' Help was always slow in coming. Even in foreign countries, the Brothers transformed their official strongholds into robber castles, from which the friendly neighboring princes were regularly attacked. \"Contempt for divine service; neglect of pious rituals; pro- faning sacred ground; insulting official couriers; lust and raping of young girls—these were some of the most common occur- rences. Thieves escaped punishment because of their respected kinfolk. Adulterers became bolder; in Marienburg* the Order tolerated a public brothel. 1 ' \"We Are the Law\" Documents dating from 1436, as noted by Kotzebue, fur- ther confirm the continuance of th is deplorable state of affairs. \"Enraged by the prevailing disorder, the pious monk, Heinrich Boringer of the Order of Carthausen, wrote to the Grand Master: 'Iniquitous administrators and judges hold the power in the land, selling jus tice at a price; oppressing the poor because their superiors are neglectful and no longer punish them.

When God shall finally demand his reckoning from you, I shall not cry out as did St. John: \"Woe is me!—for I have remained silent.\" All these things are well known but they have been carefully hidden and but few take them to he art. The heathen kings were much more virtuous than the present-day Christian rulers. Holy laws are scorned by these rulers, even though they themselves are men of the Church. And concerning the com- mon law of their subjects they jeer, saying: \"What laws of Culm? We are your laws.\" Representatives of the oppressed, who dare to speak up, are th reatened with the dungeon. '\"Particularly in the villages, and with full knowledge of the Knights, the behavior of the foresters, overseers and com- peers has been thoroughly vici ous on many occasions. Local judges are appointed who are forced to oppress the poor, and for this they are rewarded by being seated at the communion table of the Knights. Judges have revealed at confession that they were forced to render unjust decisions. When someone has been injured or killed while at work, these greedy Knights extort such enormous fines from the responsible party that he can no longer compensate his victim or his family. Nor do they tolerate friendly settlem ents; even where petty amounts are involved, one is forced, unwilli ngly, to institute suit. They buy grain at low prices during the winter and force the orig- inal vendor to repurchase it at a much higher price in the spring. Whoever complains to the Master is thrown into chains and often dispossessed from his home. Oppression and drudgery are intensified from one year to the next.

While the priests sing in Church, the Knights run riot in the taverns. No one wants to remain in the Abbey. They would much rather find them- selves an office elsewhere—in the wilderness if necessary—as far removed from the Abbey as possible—so that they may go their evil ways without anybody disturbing them. The Prussians still cling to their heathen idolatry, but no one is concerned about this. They are conscripted for work duty on Holy days—the Knights, blinded by their avarice, desire only to rule and exploit them, not to teach or convert them. Their freedom has been stolen. They are supposed to be Christians, but all Christian rights have b een denied them. When a serf who has no son dies, his lands fa ll to the manor; that is why the lands lie waste. No promise to the people is kept, and sworn oaths are but a mere trifle. Sometimes good regulations will last for half a year, but then they are trampled by the rulers. Usury, perjury and adultery are commonplace, but they are no longer considered sinful since the Knights them- selves behave in the same way. At weddings and at carnivals during Lent, the most fiendish be havior is witnessed. Murder occurs frequently, since a man's life here is worth less than a horse's. It does not upset the rulers because they can extort lines out of this. The cause for all this is in the nightly de- bauchery in the taverns—and mo re and more taverns are being licensed to make possible collecti on of the cursed taxes. Sharp gambling prevails both among the higher Knights and their subordinates. \"'May the Lord and you be prevailed on: even the priests have to lead a life more mundane than religious; they must farm their own fields and pay t ithes.

When she was grown older, the girl was married to a local mayor, bearing him a son and living with him in peaceful wedlock for sixteen years. When her husband died, the Order seized her property on the vile pretext that her marriage had been illegal, since she had at one time lain with the servant of the Comthur. \"Even peasant women working in the open fields could not be certain of their honor—their very life.

If one of these Knights of the Blessed Virgin succeeded in seducing an honorable woman, he would openly boast of his conquest, and of the woman's c onsent. Handsome wives were torn away from their husbands and locked up in castles. Daughters of wealthy burghers, already engaged to worthy journeymen, would be forced into marriage to proteges of the Order, against their own and thei r parents' wills. Complaints by the parents or the fiance w ould lead to imprisonment, and often their lips would be sealed in death. A burgher could no longer travel in safety to the annual fair, now that the Brothers themselves had become tradesmen: they bought or extorted goods at half their value; trans ported them by boat elsewhere; returned with expensive commodities obtained in exchange, not bothering to pay the vessel's owner and crew, and throw- ing those who demanded payment into the dungeon. \"Bloody street battles we re common occurrences.

When the Brothers invade foreign lands they send the Prussians before them, to shed human blood. These Prussians need no urging; they burn churches, carry on worse than Turks; and the worse their behavior, the more pleased is the Order. For this reason we have refused to be baptized—we do nor wish to become like the Prussians. \"The evil began with us slow ly, but it grows daily.

Balthasar Ruessow complains that, of a thousand peasants, hardly one can repeat the Lord's Prayer by heart. The children scream and dogs slink away when a German enters the smoke-filled hut of the Esthonian.

For centuries such hatred on the part of the vassals and such seve rity on the part of the masters continued; only during the period of Russian rule did the German nobility decide to free the peasants from these yokes which tied them to the land.\" But Treitschke adds, withou t seeming to condemn such behavior: \"By these examples we can estimate the significance of the Germanization of Old Prussia.\" This sentence characterizes, moreover, the entire attitude of the Prussian historical school on the subject of cruelty inflicted, or abuses committed in any epoch of Prussian his- tory. These writers adopt a nonchalant manner; and are not concerned with moral considerations. They insinuate that the sort of behavior for which the ancestors of present-day Prus- sianism are criticized should be considered perfect ly legitimate, in the past as well as the future; for such behavior can be explained as a sort of \"Spartan harshness\" which is indispensa- ble to the welfare of the Order, or to the welfare of its suc- cessor, the State. It would not have been proper for these Knights to become weakened in the pursuit of their fixed aims by such idle considerations as charity, fairness, gratitude or humanity. In discussing the revolt of th e oppressed Borussians (around 1260) who, for some ten years, seemed to have been trium- phant, Treitschke says: \"After ten years, during which the German domination over the Borussians was almost destroyed, the days of victory again came to the Order through the determined efforts of Landmarshal Konrad von Thierberg . . . and during the next ten years, the supremacy of the Germans was established through death and destruction. . . . Having once learned their lesson from this dreadful experience, the Order was"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"68 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY henceforth to adopt a new a nd harsher policy towards those whom they subjugated.\" The \"dreadful experience\" to which Treitschke refers was the almost complete destructi on of German domination. To prevent recurrence of this, which Treitschke considers the worst of all eventualities, a \"harsh policy\" seemed indispens- able. This was, perhaps, regretta ble, but what could one do if there was no other way out? \"Having previously been extolled as the propagator—as the rock—of Christian faith and as an instrument of Peace, Prussia has now become worthy of th e name of the New Germany,\" says Treitschke (Note that Tr eitschke thus designates the Order's State of 1260.) Actually, Treitschke might better have said that the Teutonic Order, having until then been suc- cessful in camouflaging itself as a Christian Order, was hence- forth obliged, under the pressure of events, to show its true face, and to proceed with all the ruthlessness and selfishness inherent in its basic principles—the principles with which it had been endowed by Frederick II and Hermann von Salza. In this manner, it was in future centuries to become what Treitschke, writing in 1886, has de signated as the \"New Ger- many\"—which name it still bears as part of its present-day mask. The greater part of the Orde r's political innovations and attitudes have survived until our time. Eventually the Borussians of the thirteenth century dared to revolt against their \"masters.\" \"The Prussians [Borussians] had forfeited ail their rights thr ough revolt,\" says Treitschke. \"Peace treaties with the conquered were now a thing of the past; in their place came s ubjugation and the imposition of terms dictated entirely by the degree of guilt and by military considerations.

The Order had entire townships resettled in regions where they might be less threatening. Just as the entire Order's State appears to us as a later-day 'March'* in the Carolingian tradition so the duties it imposed on the conquered served the highest purposes of the State . . .\" Of the German philosophers and theoreticians of the nine- teenth century who were referred to in the first chapter, some produced what were apparently original ideas. Others cited Machiavelli for justification. Bu t actually all these ideas can be clearly discerned three centuries before Machiavelli in the activities of the Teutonic Knight s of the thirteenth century. And this last quotation from Treitschke which describes the basic methods of the Teutonic Kn ights is like a blueprint for present-day Hitl erian conquest.

We are simply con- cerned here with showing the origins and evolution of that spirit which characterized the Pan-Prussians of the nineteenth century and of the beginning of the twentieth century—the spirit which still characterizes the Germany of today, regard- less of the names by which it has been called. But the tradition we are discussing here does not belong exclusively to the realm of ideas. We are also facing a power- ful combination of actual econom ic interests established, in the thirteenth, fourteenth a nd fifteenth centuries among the followers of the Knights, and which may be traced right down to our time.

The Knights benefited—personall y and as an Order—more than all others in the conquest of Prussian territory. But thou- sands of nobles soon came from various sections of Germany and settled near the Knights. We can consider these nobles the second most favored of all the groups which gained by the conquest. They were for the most part adventurers lured by profits to these lands where a Crusader was granted every liberty. Here these sons of noblemen—whether they had not yet come into their inheritances, or had squandered them reck- lessly—might hope to make their fortunes in short order. For some years they served in the armies of the Order without actually taking the Order's vows. Then, thanks to the connec- tions they had made in the Order, they were able to seize estates owned by Borussians or by other native people. They used the whip on the native peasants to compel the cultivation of rheir lands and treated them as slaves. These adventurers arrived in the Borussian territory with- out possessions, practically be ggars. They were called the \"Betteljunker\" (beggar squires). Still others were in the group surrounding the Order. There were former members of the Order who had deserted it to marry. There were brothers and cousins of affluent Knights who came to settle where they might profit by their close connections. Then, too, many of the Borussian nobility, now Germanized and ready to accept the most humiliating condi- tions in order to save their estates, allied themselves with the Betteljunkers during the three centuries referred to above*— which were the \"Golden Age\" of the Teutonic Order.

It is the descendant s of these groups—the Bettel- junkers, the defrocked Knight-fri ars, the relatives of the Knights, and the Germanized Borussians—who later formed the caste of Prussian junkers wh ich was to have so great an influence on the affairs of Germany down to our time. From the monastic austerity of the Order stemmed what became known later as \"Prussian discipline.\" Despite this austerity, rigorously imposed wherever relations between Knights or the Order's interests were concerned, an extraordi- nary laxity of morals prevaile d among the Knights in Prussia. The behavior of the Landjunke rs, who were not directly under monastic discipline, was largely responsible for the abuses flourishing in the Order's State. This contradictory situation, Spartan discipline intermingled with flagrant abuse, reflected the lasting alliance between representatives of two ideas of life to the advantage of each. It was to remain char- acteristic of Prussia until the present, and more recently (since 1870), of Germany dominated by Prussia. In a work published in 1904 (Geschichte des deutschen Ordens) the German writer, Carl Lampens, characterizes as follows the behavior of these ancestors of the Junkers: \"Instead of treating the natives with Christian love, the Order permitted the tyranny of the Landjunkers, as well as that of their own local regents in the newly conquered lands. In a town where the populace had reverted to heathenism, one of these regents, Herma nn von Altenburg, had the vil- lage exits locked, and slowly burned to death all the inhabi- tants. . . . The Landjunkers wanted to live only at the ex- pense of the natives, whom they intended to make their personal slaves.

The Borussian Strain Attempts have often been made to determine whether or not the Borussian heritage runs deep in the blood of present- day Prussians, and particularly the Junker Prussians. It would be no easier to gauge exactly the ethnic contribution of the Borussians to the present-day Prussian group than to evaluate, for example, the precise contribution of the Saxon, as com- pared with the Norman, to the English of the twentieth cen- tury. But we do not need precise, statistical figures to form a general idea of the result of the mingling of Teutonic with Slavic elements in the Prussians. Despite strict monastic rule over the inner life of the Order, the Knights, in their outside be havior, more nearly resembled the barbaric Teutons of Tacitus than the founders of the Church which preached Charity: pre-Christian elements sur- vived among both the Teutoni c Knights and those who surrounded them—the ancestors of the Junkers. The examples set daily by the savage Borussians to the Germans and the marriages between the German Junkers and the Borussian Christian proselytes (who never really understood the moral teachings of the Church) emphasized pre-Christian traits in the Prussianism born of this curious fusion. If we bear in mind that their descent from these pre-Christian or, if we prefer, \"barbarous\" ancestors is relatively recent, we can bet- ter understand the peculiar behavior of the twentieth- century Junkers—for example the cruel methods of the Fehme in the period after the first World War. Only six cen- turies have passed since Boru ssian wives were obliged to render absolute obedience to their husbands, failing which they were burned alive. Lampens tells of the following inci-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 73 dent which occurred during the wars between the Knights and Borussians: \"The High Priest invoked the Gods; whereupon the Holy Oracle of Romowe promised the heathens victory, on condi- tion that a German Christian woman offer of her own free will to be burned in sacrifice—a tribute to their Gods. The heathens actually found such a woman who, after becoming satiate with all the pleasures of debauchery, climbed up on the funeral pyre. And now the Prussians arose in their united strength.\" The immediate descendants of these Borussians married the daughters of the Betteljunkers and contributed to the forma- tion of a caste which may in many respects be considered a survival of the darkest Middle Ages. The primitive virtues of these uncivilized people were dest royed, but their traditions of cruelty merged, by a sort of osmosis, with the harshness and arrogance of the German Kn ights.

Each guild complied with the laws, which assured them peace, decency and virtue. No one could come armed to morning services. Wh ile merry-making, 'none must behave in a manner disgraceful to the sight or sound' on pen- alty of one pound of wax. 'None shall lack respect for the aged, nor shall one offend his neighbor by calling him by an evil name.' They had already formed a club at this time known as the Companye, whose rules, if broken in word or deed, imposed a fine on the violator of one barrel of honey. Similar fines were levied on drunkards. Only after vesper bells had rung would gatherings be permitted, and taverns had to be shut at nine o'clock. No carnivals or fairs except during Shrovetide; women to visit their suitors only during certain limited hours; journeymen not to be allowed time off on the morning following a Feast Day. \"And thus Prussia offered the curious spectacle wherein the immorality of the leaders did not corrupt their subjects and where integrity had fled from the Knight's castle to the bur- gher's cottage.\" This opposition between two co ntradictory approaches to life was the same in all sections of Germany, where the Teu- tonic Knights, reaching out from their Prussian fief, had suc- ceeded in establishing a local command in the principal cities. The Order was everywhere detested by the bourgeoisie, and conflicts were frequent.

Here we see before us two c ontradictory Germanic devel- opments which occurred independently of one another until the middle of the nineteenth ce ntury. The one, characterizing the greater part of Germany, was essentially Christian, and formed part of what we call \"Western civilization.\" The other, proceeding in a direct line from the ambitious Germano- Roman emperors, was localized in Prussia. Representatives of the latter Tendency recognize d no rights but their own, and regarded with great disdain th e cooperative, altruistic spirit prevailing in other German States. They described this spirit as the result of \"degeneration\" and patiently awaited the moment when they could annihilate it in their domination over the rest of Germany. Th e moment was to come under Bismarck. The Assassinations of Danzig The assassination by the Order of the burgomasters of Danzig in 1411 was an event long recalled by the city bour- geoisie. Following the battle of 1410, in which the Knights had suffered the most crushing de feat in their history at the hands of the Poles, the Chief Burgomaster of Danzig, Konrad Lczkau, disguised as a Polish beggar, succeeded in passing through the Polish lines. He ma naged to warn the Margrave of Brandenburg and other German princes, who hurriedly dispatched considerable reinforcements to the Knights. In the Order's tradition gratitude befitted only the weak; so the Knights imposed heavy taxes and restrictions on the city of Danzig, and when their erstwhile benefactor, Konrad Lezkau, protested bitterly against such behavior, the full rage of the local Comthur was unleashed ag ainst him.

Pretending to celebrate this reconciliation, the Comthur invited Konrad and his colleagues to a great banquet to be given in their honor at the Kni ghts' castle on Palm Sunday. Lezkau, two other burgomasters , and a councillor accepted the invitation. On their way to the castle they met the Com- thur's jester, who said to them jokingly: \"If you knew what they were cooking, you might not come to eat.\" One of Lez- kau's colleagues was frightened at these words and returned home. The others, under the exhortations of the worthy Kon- rad, whose honest soul could ne ver suspect the villainy of the Knights, entered the castle and were immediately seized. Brought before the Comthur and his Knights, violent insults assailed them from all sides, but they had the courage to keep calm. Thereupon the Comthur summoned the hangman of Elbing, a neighboring city, and ordered him to execute the three prisoners. The hangman refused, saying that it was not his custom to execute men unle ss there were legally consti- tuted judgments. He was severe ly whipped for his insolence and the Knights decided to do this work themselves, and first celebrated their decision in drink for several hours. The prisoners were then brought in. The Knights \"leaped at them like mad dogs\" (say the chroniclers) and killed them with knives and swords. Lezkau suffered ten wounds and his throat was cut, while one of his coll eagues suffered sixteen wounds, and the third seventeen. For several days thereafter the Order tried to keep secret what had happened, and they even had their guards accept the daily provisions brought each day by the wives of the three men.

The citizenry, speechless with sorrow, brought back the bod- ies and buried them. One might think that the Grand Master, having learned of these events, would perhaps have decided to punish the Dan- zig Knights, so that the Orde r might not be identified with such procedures. He did nothing of the sort. On the contrary, the wives and children of the assassinated burgomasters were driven from the city, and all their goods were confiscated. From Order to Duchy In the fifteenth century occurred the events which weak- ened the Teutonic Order and finally led to the creation of the Prussian secular State. In order to defend themselves against the abuses and autoc- racy of the Order, the bourgeoisie in the Prussian cities formed a protective \"Bund\" in 1438, which was named the \"Marienwerder Bund,\" for the site of the place where the organization was formed. The spirit of decency and coopera- tion was rising against the principles of exploitation and nar- row egoism. In the German cities, the Hansa's traditions were in full flower. This league of merchant cities, the Hansa, found both its function and its prosperity in the exchange, rather than the usurpation of other people's goods. United, the members of the Bund considered themselves sufficiently strong to oppose the Order—this vulture which terrorized them. At first the Bund protested simp ly against the exactions of the Order. But in 1453 the Emperor upheld the Knights, and severely reprimanded the Bund.

At the end of a few weeks the latter had seized fifty-six of these burgs. The war lasted for thirteen years and claimed heavy casual- ties on both sides. The cities asked assistance of the King of Poland, whom they invited to extend his reign over Prussia —\"this country originally evolved from the 'crown of Po- land.' \" The burghers who, for the most part, were German- speaking, made this request because they were convinced that all their misfortunes dated from the time of the Knights' reign over their country, and that the Polish kings would show much greater respect for their rights and traditions. The Knights finally realized that they could no longer con- tinue the struggle. Their army , which had totaled 71,000 men at the beginning of the war, had now decreased to 1700 men. The peace treaty that was signed at Thorn in 1466 repre- sented a complete defeat for the Order. The countries of Culm, Michelau and Pomerania-Minor, with their principal cities of Thorn, Danzig, Elbing, Marienburg and the bishopric of Ermeland, came under Polish rule. The Order was allowed to retain the rest of its territory, but the Grand Master, as a \"Duke of Poland,\" was now obliged to yield to the King. Half the officials of the Order, in the lands under its administration, would from now on be Poles. The cities were to be protected, and it was forbidden for the Order to burden them with any new laws or taxes. Following the signing of the treaty, the Grand Master humbled himself on bended knee before King Casimir. The latter quickly helped him to his feet, tears in his eyes. The only German prince who had aided the Order was the Margrave of Brandenburg, Frederick von Hohenzollern.* *The Hohenzolferns, natives of Swab ia (which was part of Bavaria), were the \"Burgraves\" (local rulers) of Nuremberg. In 1411 they were raised to the rank of Margrave of Branden burg by Emperor Sigismund in exchange for a loan of 100,000 Hungarian florins, a loan greatly appreciated by the Emperor, who was constantly in need of money."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE CAVALCADE OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS 79 The Margrave and the Order had concluded an unusual pact, promising to give mutual aid to one another against the sub- jects of each. It was the Margrave who, in 1466, acting in the name of the Order, negotiate d the peace with the King of Poland for the Knights. Relations between the Order and the Hohenzollerns were now excellent. It is understa ndable then, that the Knights considered it useful in 1511 to elect Albert of Hohenzollern and Brandenburg to the dignity of Grand Master of the Order, which post he filled with full understanding of the Order's traditions and aims. Nevertheless, it wa s Albert who was responsible for the secularization of the Order's State. Actually the Teutonic Knights for some time now had b een much more a caste con- trolling a State, than a Monk's Order serving religious ends. The Knight-officials were most in fluential, and directed every- thing for the benefit of the Order, of themselves, and of the Junkers, with whom they were united by bonds of kinship, friendship and complicity. A very small minority of the Knights were still faithful to the religious traditions, but they had no influence on the Order. Albert did nothing but give official status to an existing condition, when in 1525 he transformed the Order's State into the hereditary Duchy of Prussia (with approval of the King of Poland, who re- mained suzerain of the Duchy as he had been of the Order's State). The occasion for this act was the Reformation, the ideas of which Albert allowed to penetrate deeply into the Order. This had curious consequences, for it was possible for some time to witness the strange spectacle of an Order of Monks, of whom some were Catholic but the majority Lutheran; an Order having two initiation rituals with slight differences between them—one for the Cathol ic Brothers and the other for the Lutheran disciples.

The former Knights retained their positions, but from now on it was possible for them to marry legally. Thus they found them- selves on the same level as th eir allies, the Junkers. The few remaining Knights who were still faithful to the traditions of a closed and monastic Order emigrated to Mergentheim, there to continue as a living anachronism shorn of every purpose and function. Finally in 1809, Napol eon dissolved this phantom Order,* but he did not shatter th e forces of the true Teutonic Order, which, secularized and hiding behind a variety of masks, survived in the Prussian State. All sorts of organizations served as disguises. Secret societies had been functioning in the shadow of the Teutonic Order. The junkers were not directly s ubject to rules of the Order. They had found it useful to form bonds among themselves, under protection of which they could further their own inter- ests and pursue ends similar to those of the Order. As far back as 1397 there had been created a secret Junker society known as the \"Society of Li zards\"—Eidechsengesellschaft—a name whose symbolic significan ce may have been that its members* intention was to creep in among the fissures of the Order's State.

According to the secret rules of this Association the Land- junkers were to support patriotic German interests only if this were to their own advantage. And already at that time they found their advantage only in the ruin of the rest of humanity.

The Order itself had among its secret aims that of serving as a \"Hospital\" for German nobility. We have seen that the Order of the Teutonic Knights was founded originally for the purpose of creating a hospital for the German crusaders in the Holy Land. The Knights used the term \"Hospital\" in a symbolic sense (another exam ple of the symbolism common in the Middle Ages) and conceale d behind ir one of the aims of the Order—\"conspiracy to promote the interests of a caste.\" This aspect of the Orde r definitely existed along with the imperialistic aspects so clearly defined in the Bull of Rimini, the true Charter of the Order.

The \"secrets,\" then, can concern only a more detailed statement of the aims of expansion and conquest than was originally contained in the intentionally vague Bull of Rimini; or they might be related to the aim of protecting, in the Order's capacity as a hospital, the caste interests of the Ger- man nobility.

On one occasion when the Order was severely criticized, this name, \"the National Institute for the Nobility,\" was cited as an argument in its defense.

The Junkers passed a few uneasy hours. But the upheaval was unsuccess- ful, in that it did not reach the true root of the evil. In an enthusiastic but somewhat naive spirit, the revolutionaries asked Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, to assume lead- ership of their movement and to accept the imperial crown.

This action might seem surprising on the part of a group which so strongly desired the a ggrandizement of Prussia. As proven by later events, their aim was Prussian hegemony over the Reich as the first stage toward a more far-reaching hegemony. Yet, appare ntly, they did not wish to seize the opportunity offered them in 1848, whereby they might have united the various German states under the rule of the King of Prussia.

There was the 'old Prussian' spirit which resented any nationa l aspirations th at might en- croach upon the importance and self-appreciation of specific Prussiandom, and which still had strength in the country immediately surrounding Berlin [**] and in some of the eastern provinces.

As a st udent, he was notorious for a spicy tongue and a ready sword; the older citizens of Goet- tingen still bear his wild tricks in mind.\" The description of Junker manners in the character of the young Bismarck corresponds trait for trait with the traditional prototype of the Teutonic Kn ights, the ancestors of the Junkers. Busch has a few apologetic passa ges here on the subject of the Junker connections and attitudes of Bismarck: \"The Chancellor was a Junker; he lived a Junker's life for a con- siderable time, and to some ex tent represented the views of his fellow-Junkers. As a Minister, however, he belonged to the party designated by the epithet 'Junkerdom' only to the extent that, like itself, he wa s a Royalist in thought and feel- ing, and, above all, objected to Parliamentary government. ... If he were styled 'soldier' instead of 'Junker'—if his mili- tarism were grumbled at in stead of his Junkerdom—there would be some sense in such a view of his character, although it would be no reproach to him. What is spoken of as mili- tarism is in reality that Prussian discipline by virtue of which all the forces in the State, all the members of the govern- mental organism in its various branches, work together with one common object—that system, the first principle of which for all connected with it (from the lowest to the highest in rank, including the Sovereign) is obedience, or rather the subordination of each individual's personal inclinations and opinions to those of his immediate official Superior in particu-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY lar, and to the interests of the State in general.* Every part of this system is an accurate f it, dovetailing admirably with the part adjoining it; all goes on smoothly, as in the army, which is merely the most marked outcome of the spirit animating all our State institutions and officials, besides being the chief and central school in which that spir it is imparted to the popula- tion at large. \"Such a system as this—of which Bismarck himself once said: 'I am ambitious to deserv e one day the praise bestowed by history upon Prussian discipline'—is quite compatible with an abundant measure of political liberty, but not with the Parliamentary form of government demanded by our Lib- erals . . . Bismarck is the incorporate ideal of the Prussian officer and official, not of the Prussian Junker. Nothing short of stupidity or dishonesty can account for any man mistaking him in this respect. Future gene rations will not be guilty of such folly or wickedness. Busch here seems to be raising an issue over words. For if we restrict the use of the expr ession \"Junker\" to that class of Prussian \"country-squires\" living in their Middle Age para- dise, Bismarck, although springi ng from this very class, far surpassed them in scope and daring. Busch says that in the final analysis Bismarck should be considered basically as a Prussian officer or official. However we know that these Prus- sian officers and officials are s ons and grandsons of the same Prussian \"country-squires,\" or that they are descended from other officers and officials whose families, since the time of the Order, had been closely allie d with the Landjunkers. Consid- ering all this, we are justified in saying that all these elements really formed one great caste—regardless of whether we call it Junker or not. Because he was more intelligent than the class he represented, because he had travelled abroad, Bis- * The adherence by Bismarck and the entire Prussian school to the prin- ciple of obedience, to the interests of the State and to Prussian discipline, is, as we have seen, the product of a long tradition stemming from the Teutonic Order."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"PRUSSIA COMES UP IN THE WORLD 93 marck became more \"civilized\" and developed a much broader outlook than his associates. That is why he might have ap- peared, at times, to be devi ating from his original course. This was not so, for Bismarck until the end of his career con- tinued to serve the forces whic h had descended directly from the Teutonic Order, always with the same devotion and ruth- Iessness: he simply used a little more tact in his actions than did his masters. Busch's division of the Prussian ruling class into army offi- cers, officials and Junkers goes back, under different names, to the time of the Order. The Prussian army officers were formerly Teutonic Knights serv ing the Order by the sword. The Prussian officials had previously been \"Officials of the Order.\" Lastly the junkers were descended in a direct line from those friends and relatives of the Knights who had come to Prussia as no more than Betteljunkers, and who had seized the lands with the complicity of the Knights, at the same time absorbing the remnants of the Germanized Borussian nobility. It is this Trinity—holy only to those individuals participating in it—which for centuries has been the keystone of Prussian affairs, and which has also become the keystone of Germany, since the time the \"Reich\" became equivalent to \"Greater Prussia.\" This tripartite caste was no vague entity, but was well organized. Its tactics and dir ection were determined by the secret societies we have disc ussed. The Junkers, Prussian \"country-squires,\" played a dominant role within this group. They were concerned with preserving the advantages de- rived from rights which permitted them to exploit their land and men by methods used in the Middle Ages. Because they maintained great unity among themselves, they were in a posi- tion to exercise much influence behind the scenes in all ques- tions of political significance, and to make their opinions re- spected during all periods of Prussian history. Their aims did not differ much from those of the army officers and officials"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"94 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY who remained their faithful allies, but because they were bet- ter organized than the others and financially more independ- ent, they were at all times more influential in the affairs of the State. Further, the Junkers were concerned with the interests of the State only so long as they could maintain it as a servile instrument in their own hands. The Prussian army officers and civic officials, many of whom were related to Junkers (a fact which contributed to greater interdependence of the three groups), loyally carried out the junkers' intentions. A sort of \"l ocal patriotism\" masked pri- vate interests: these interests were, for the junkers, the raison d'etre for this association. As for the officers and officials, the State had symbolically taken the place of the Order and they intended to serve it with almost monastic submission and disci- pline. Collaboration with the J unkers who were the masters of the State was simply a matter of doing their duty—their Prus- sian duty; and, in doing it, they used all the traditional harsh- ness of Prussian methods. The Technique of \"'Isolation\" It is Bismarck who extended Prussian power over all other German States with the exception of Austria; Bismarck who in 1848-49 did everything to prevent the King of Prussia from accepting the crown of Germany. King Frederick Wil- liam had to yield actual control of royal power because of his mental state, which had beco me precarious. His brother William was elected Regent. The new Regent believed as strongly as did Bismarck in the necessity for uniting Ger- many under Prussian\" hegemony. He was hesitant as to the methods to be pursued in this. Bismarck was to provide these methods for him.

The Prussians considered Austria as their only rival for German hegemony, and cost what it might, she was to be eliminated from the scene. Moreover, Austria, with the urbane and kindly methods of her administration was, for Bismarck, a shocking antithesis to Prussian harshness and severity. As such she influenced the other German States in a way which the Prussians considered pernicious. She had, therefore, to be eliminated at any price. Four years spent as ambassador to the Russian court fa- miliarized Bismarck with the intrigues of diplomacy; so that when he came to power in 1862 he brought with him both national and international experience as background for the battle he was going to wage. At first Austria still seemed too influential for Bismarck to consider immediately elimina ting her from the Bund. There- fore it was first necessary to \"isolate\" her. The Prussian tech- nique for isolating an adversar y from his allies has always been the same since the early times of the Teutonic Order: first, making overtures to the country or the Prince who was to be isolated; second, after the victim fell into the trap, point- ing out to his allies that the former was willing to go along without them. Generally this was enough to isolate him com- pletely. In 1863, while discussions on th e eventual reorganization of the Bund were taking place, Prussia demanded permanent presidency of the Bund, on an equal footing with Austria. The proposal was rejected by th e latter. But Bismarck found another occasion to tie up with Austria, and to trap this country into isolation from the other German States.

The Bund attempted to restore sovereignty over thes e Duchies to the Prince. Bis- marck persuaded Austria to i gnore the stand taken by the Bund, and to remain on the sidelines. In a treaty signed in 1864, Austria and Prussia decided to act on the question as independe nt powers, and to determine by common agreement the fate of the Duchies of the Elbe (without considering the desires of the Bund for return of these Duchies to the Augustenburg family). In his memoirs, Bismarck acknowledges that, by acting supposedly for the \"liberation of Germans from Da nish oppression,\" he was en- deavoring above all to procure these territories for Prussia. He had clearly realized that the port of Kiel and the canal con- necting the North Sea to the Baltic might some day serve as a base for the establishment of Prussian naval power. He was aware that his aims could be realized only through conclusion of treaties which even before signing them he intended to vio- late. But he confesses also (resuming here a thesis whose moral inspiration stemmed from the Order, and which is found repeated among the Prussian theoreticians of the nineteenth century) that a treaty had but little value to him unless it gained additional validity, after its conclusion, through the concordant interests of the contracting parties. In August, 1864, following a short and victorious cam- paign by the Prussian and Austrian armies against the Danes, Bismarck signed the Treaty of Vienna, in which Schleswig- Holstein and Lauenburg were to be administered jointly by Austria and Prussia. From this point on, Bismarck concerned himself solely with eliminating his associate, Austria, from the pact which had been concluded.

On June 14, 1866, the Diet rejected the Prussian proposal by a vote of nine to six. The following day, Pru ssian troops marched against Austria, crossing through Saxony. After a campaign of seven weeks, Austria was defeated at Koeniggraetz. A Tentacle Reaches Out With her only rival for Germ an hegemony thus easily eliminated, Prussia now profited from the propitious psycho- logical moment, to impose her terms on the German States. Austria had to accept a \"new German organization without the participation of Austria.\" Tw o confederations were estab- lished: the North German Bund, including all States north of the Main River, and the Sout h German Bund. Relations be- tween the two Bunds were to be defined in subsequent con- ventions. The North German Bund was to have the King of Prussia as its permanent and hereditary ruler. The Duchies of the Elbe were simply annexed by Prussia, as were the north German States which had previously favored Austria: Hesse- Kassel, Hanover, Nassau, and th e free city of Frankfort. Half of Bismarck's plan was now accomplished: all north German States were henceforth under Prussia's control. The North in its entirety had always had' more understanding of Prussian methods than had the South.

The Duke of Nassau and the Elector of Hesse formally renounced their rights, and the daughter of the Duke of Augustenburg married the young prince William of Hohenzollern, who later became Emperor William II. But the princes of Hanover, who were also heirs to the throne of Brunswick, for a long time considered them- selves in a state of war with Prussia. Their faithful subjects organized passive resistance to Pr ussian occupation. It is inter- esting to note that the royal family of Hanover is descended from the Welfs or Guelfs, whos e struggles against the \"Ghi- bellines\" have become legendary. As we have seen (p. 44) the Ghibellines were partisans of the Hohenstaufens, from whom Emperor Frederick II wa s descended—the same Fred- erick who had bequeathed his imperial mission to the Teu- tonic Order, the ancestor of Prussia. The struggle between Guelfs and Ghibellines continued until the end of the fifteenth century. It is perhaps no simple coincidence that the princes of Hanover, descendants of th e Welfs, were so violently opposed to the ambitions of the Prussians—the spiritual grand- children of Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen, or Ghibelline line. The royal family of E ngland issued from the same family of Hanover. As such , they too descended from the Welfs, the traditional enemies of the imperialistically ambi- tious Hohenstaufens, of whom Prussia became the heir. The Isolation of France With Austria removed from Germ an affairs, the first thing to do was to neutralize those other influences which opposed Prussian domination over Germ any.

To this end Bismarck employed the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"PRUSSIA COMES UP IN THE WORLD 99 same methods: he showed hi mself very friendly toward France and entered into discussions with her. During these conversations, Bismarck suggested all sorts of compensations for France if she would permit Prussian expansion of power. Napoleon III at first claimed the left bank of the Rhine, but Bismarck conducted negotiations in such a manner that a solution, calling for the annexation of Luxembourg and Belgium by France, and the extension of Prussian power to the south German States, gained preference in the discussions. Nothing was concluded: neither Napoleon III nor Bismarck definitely accepted the plan. But Bismarck preserved the original draft of the project which had been written in the hand of Benedetti, the ambassador of France. He then ar- ranged for a facsimile of the plan in Benedetti's handwriting to appear in the London Times, and at the same time, brought to the attention of the south German States the original claims of Napoleon III to the left bank of the Rhine. The isolation of France was accomplished at one stroke. Suspicion was cast on her in England and in the south Ger- man States. The latter, which then counted on the support of France, from now on felt more dis posed to deal with Prussia. Bismarck now concluded a secret military pact—offensive and defensive—-with the south Ge rman States, by virtue of which the supreme command reverted to the King of Prussia. He next tried to find a reason for declaring war against France, so that Prussian command over all the German armies might become a fact. Indeed, he believed that Prussian direc- tion on the military level—especially if this were successful— might easily be followed by Pru ssian rule on all other levels over all German States.

The King tele- graphed to Bismarck, giving him the details of this meeting. Bismarck deliberately \"edited\" the telegram, and had the al- tered version published. This ruse made the French attitude appear more unfriendly, and the response of the King more abrupt than they had been in reality. Under the influence of this fa mous \"Ems dispatch\" a bel- ligerent atmosphere was created within France and Germany. This was exactly what Bismarck had desired. Napoleon III, under the pressure of French public opinion, declared war— a war which immediately turned to the advantage of the German armies, which were under Prussian command. In January, 1871, a few days before the capitulation of Paris, the King of Bavaria (who had always been considered the traditional ally of France) in the joy of conquest, proposed that William I of Prussia be proclaimed Emperor of Germany. The proclamation took place at the Palace of Versailles. Bismarck, who had accompanied the King to Paris, settled at Versailles for a few months. He used these surroundings to create conditions psychologically favorable for his plans. In the impressive halls of th e Palace he had no difficulty in obtaining consent of the German princes to the formalities necessary for the creation of th e Reich. He pa ssed all his time in Versailles at this task a nd succeeded in establishing the unity, under Prussian rule, of the States of north and south Germany. Bismarck had thus put his theories of 1848-49 into prac- tice: not to allow the King of Prussia to accept the throne of Germany if the latter came as a spontaneous offering of the people; but to acquire the throne through \"blood and iron,\" which according to the traditional conceptions of the Teu- tonic Order was the path to more lasting results. It did not matter that to achieve these goals it was necessary to provoke wars against Austria and France artificially.

From the day Bismarck succeeded in subjecting the other German States to Prussian rule the principal task was to im- pose the Teutonic spirit and Prussian severity on the whole of the German population, and to combat their easygoing tolerant ways—as a weakness, de riving from the \"softening\" Christian philosophy and corrupting the soul. The Hydra Needs Time Culminating in the gains of Bismarck, the Prusso-Teutonics had made great strides since their modest beginning in the thirteenth century. To recapitulate briefly: We have seen that an uninterrupted evolution proceeded from the beginning of the thirteenth century until 1870. In 1226, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II entrusted a vast imperial mission to the recentl y created Order of Teutonic Knights, in his Bull of R imini. The Knights launched the \"campaign of Prussia\" and c onquered one country after an- other, dragging their neighbors into war on the flimsiest of pretexts, for the sole purpose of constantly increasing their territory. The Order was soon acting entirely on its own account as the sole heir of the traditions of the Hohenstaufen emperors (indirect descendents of the Carolingian emperors) whose line died out with Conr ad IV, son of Frederick II. These are the traditions which point toward world domi- nation, and which are in opposition and direct conflict to the claim of the Church of universal spiritual sovereignty. Under the protection of the Order, a caste of nobles, enjoying the favor and complicity of the Kni ghts, settled in the conquered countries. These \"Junkers\" in turn tried to appropriate for their exclusive advantage the very aims and traditions which the Order itself had carried down from the Germano-Roman"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"102 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY emperors. Already, during the reign of the Order in Prussia between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries, the Land- junkers were those who sought the greatest advantages from their privileged position, and they committed the greatest abuses. To protect their special interests they founded a secret society in the fourteenth century, (\"Society of Lizards\"). Under their influence, the Stat e which the Order of Knights had formed was secularized in the sixteenth century by a Grand Master who was a member of the Hohenzollern fam- ily, and became a purely political unit. Instead of being subservient to the Knights as they had been in the past, the Junkers intende d, from the time of the secu- larization of the Order's State, to have at their service the State officials and army officers, de scended from two branches of knighthood—officials of the Order and the warrior Knights. The Electors, and later the Kings of Prussia, had to reckon with their desires and interest s. So long as these were re- spected, the State—Duchy or Kingdom—could pursue those ancient plans established by the visionary Hohenstaufens, extending the bounds of conquest more and more. The Great Elector and King Frederick II found all sorts of pretexts for waging war. The goal was always the same- ceaseless conquest. The actions of Bismarck were no different, but he was not content with increasing the territory of Prus- sia. Using the same methods as his predecessors, he achieved domination by Prussia over all the German States—the re- establishment of the Empire to the advantage of Prussia and the Prussian clique. The circle was now completed. The Hohenstaufens had launched the Knights on a path of world conquest, but had lost the Empi re. The descendants of the Knights established their regime over a vast territory which served them as a fief, and from which they again conquered the Empire. In observing how the Great Elector, Frederick the Great, and Bismarck ail arrived at their goals, one cannot help but"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"PRUSSIA COMES UP IN THE WORLD 103 be struck by the similarity be tween their hypocritical methods and those employed by the Orde r, as described by contempo- rary chroniclers. Bismarck closed the circle, but by the inclusion of this im- mense territory within the Prussian orbit, at the same time put a temporary stop to the m ovement of expansion. The hydra needed time to digest the lamb. Thus in the period be- tween 1870 and 1914, Prussia could give the world the impres- sion that it had nothing to fear from her, and most people were lulled by the illusion that the era of Prussian conquest had passed. The world did not realize that Prussia needed a temporary period of peace to organize the territories it had acquired, Bismarck himself had decided to call a halt. The Empire was to be thoroughly Prussianized, for only the Prussian dis- cipline inherited from the Order—the \"devota subjectio\" so dear to the Knights, translated into civic terms in Prussia— would in the Jong run enable other German countries also to acquire the desirable t oughness and ruthlessness. This development would some day enab le the Prussians to resume the path of conquest, this time on behalf of the Prussianized Empire. A Ghost Returns Principally due to the leadership of Bismarck, years of internal organization followed, but the theoreticians of Prus- sianism, the Treitschkes, the von Bernhardis and the others, looked toward the future and continued to keep the flame alive. In German intellectual circles they kept in the fore- ground the ambitions for world domination as well as the basic principles of tactical method through which to achieve it. During this time Bismarck hi mself was appare ntly occupied only with standardizing laws throughout Germany, and with unifying the army and the other institutions. Later, over a"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"104 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY period of years, William II pur sued the same task, but being more of a mystic than his predecessors, he considered it use- ful, toward the end of the nineteenth century, to reestablish the organization of the Teutonic Knights in Germany and principally in East Prussia. This gesture was purely symbolic and added but little to the existing state of affairs; the junkers, the officers and officials who were now active in the Order had for a long time been united by numerous ties. They had their secret societies, within which they regularly discussed projects concerning the protection of their personal interests and national expan- sion. Nevertheless, it was characteristic that William II went further than mere reconstruction of the Order by rebuilding Marienburg, its traditional seat. He also named one infantry regiment (No. 152) as well as two artillery regiments (Nos. 71 and 72) for the Teutonic Knights. Measures of this kind would obviously increase the pride and the ambitions of the junkers, and of their associates in the army and administration. \"Hass gegen England, 1914\" The next task to be undertaken was the attempt to smash the world hegemony of the power which was considered by the Prusso-Teutonic forces as their only major rival—Eng- land. Already List had pointed out the importance of this problem for the benefit of German imperialists of the future. Treitschke, in his writings, consta ntly fulminated against Eng- lish hegemony, and thus kept alive a flame of hatred which was to become useful at the proper moment. The English had become masters of a fifth of th e habitable lands of the earth. \"Through robbery,\" said Treitschke. N. A.

No need for that. The mere existence of the British Empire is an insult to Prussian Germany. Cramb, who was in regular contact with German university circles, and who could clearly estimate the state of mind beyond the Rhine in 1913, said: \"England's possessions, England's arrogance on the seas, her claim to world- wide empire—these, Germany answers, are to Germany an insult not less humiliating than any she has met with in the past.

It assigns to Germany in the future a role like that which Rome or Hellas or Judaea or Islam have played in the past. That is Germany's hero-ideal. It is at least greatly conceived. \"Assuming for a moment that this world-predominance is possible to Germany, what is the testimony of Germany's past,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"PRUSSIA COMES UP IN THE WORLD 107 to her capacity to play this part? You find Germany an em- pire already in the ninth century, if you regard Charlemagne as a German—as he was; and again you have attempts at imperialism made by the German race under the Ottos in the tenth century; but most distinctly is Germany an imperial power in the twelfth century in the time of the Hohenstaufen, one of the most tragic dynasties in history.\" Characterizing the spiritual heritage of Treitschke, Cramb says: \"Treitschke has defined the aim of Germany, and Treitschke's definition, which has been taken up by his dis- ciples, is this: that just as the greatness of Germany is to be found in the governance of Germany by Prussia, so the great- ness and good of the world is to be found in the predomi- nance there of German culture, of German mind, in a word, of German character. This is the ideal of Germany, and this is Germany's role as Treitschke saw it in the future.\" These considerations of Cramb (originating in a lecture series he gave in 1913 and published in April, 1914) certainly correspond with the evolution of things during the first World War, which was a first attempt to rupture English political hegemony. But other passages in these same lectures have greater point for a more recent past than the 1914 epoch. Thus Cramb points out that th e forces directing Germany intend not only to achieve world dominion in their own way, and to eliminate for this purpose the power of England. What they are equally concerned with is to replace the predominant civilization of the world with another, purely Germanic; and to do away with Christianity, the \"softening influence\" of which is in direct contradict ion to the Teutonic moral con- cepts. \"This world dominion of wh ich Germany dreams,\" says Cramb, with great academic objectivity, \"is not simply a material dominion.

But Judsea and Galilee struck Germany in the splendor and heroism of her prime. Germany and the whole Teutonic people in the fifth century made the great error. They conquered Rome, hut dazzled by Rome's authority they adopted the religion and the culture of the vanquished. Germany's own d eep religious instinct, her native genius for religion, manifested in her creative success, was arrested, stunted, thwarted. But, having once adopted the new faith, she strove to live that faith, and for more than thirty generations she has struggled and wrestled to see with eyes that were not her eyes, to worship a God that was not her God, to live with a world-vision that was not her vision, and to strive for a heaven that was not her heaven. And with what chivalry and with what loyalty did not Germany strive! With what ardour she flung herself into the pursuit of saint- hood as an ideal and then into the Crusades! Conrad and Barbarossa, Otto the Great and Frederick II, Hildebrand and Innocent III, were of her blood, so were Godfrey and Tan- cred and Bohemund. Yet in the Ea st, in the very height of her enthusiasm, the outward fabric of faith sank. In the East where she sought the grave of Christ, she saw beyond it the grave of Balder, and higher than the New Jerusalem the shin- ing walls of Asgard and of Valh alla. In Jerusalem, standing beside an empty grave, the summits of a mightier vision gleamed spectral around her. An d whilst her Crusaders, front to front with Islam, burst into passionate denials and set Mohammed above Christ, or in exasperated scorn derided all religion, her great thinkers and mystics led her steadily toward the serener heights, where knowledge and faith dissolve in vision, and ardour is all. \" 'A great hope had sunk; a mightier hope had arisen.

The Germany of Hitler is much closer to this point, but here as elsewhere, we can see that she only executes what has for many years been definitely planned by the Prusso-Teutonic group. Cramb does not resolve the pr oblem whose contradictions strike him. He is impressed by the profundity of the neo- pagan spirit which he has encountered in Germany, and by the political importance of Pru ssian traditions. On the other hand he is well aware of the Germany of Herder and Goethe and of its \"cosmopolitan and peaceful spirit\" but he does not know which to believe is the true spirit of Germany. He does not yet come to the conclusion that both Germanies might quite well have existed over a period of centuries simultane- ously; the one always deeply pagan, of a pretended Christian- ity (Emperor Henry IV, Barbarossa, his grandson Frederick II, the Teutonic Knights and their descendants); and the other, thoroughly Christianized to an extent as great as any other European country, but constantly suffering from the exactions and egotism of the Pagan Germany. Cramb sees only the contradictions, but th e permanent and secular char- acter of the conflict seems to escape him completely. Prussia's propaganda was so clever that by 1913—forty-three years after the Prussian clique had manoeuvred themselves into the saddle over the rest of German y—she made the world forget that \"Prussia\" and \"Germany\" are not absolutely identical.

In reality he was a figurehead who, at times, was even something of an encumbrance to the Prusso-Teutonic forces —who alone counted in the control of German affairs; for in these outbursts, which he did not very well know how to control, he revealed all too readily the policies and plans which should have been kept se cret. But this was of little importance since the Prusso-Teutonic plans were pursued unwaveringly, regardless of wh ich man was used as a front. This man alone would appear to the outside world. Obviously Bismarck, who wa s a man of high qualities, rendered much more service to the Prusso-Teutonic cause than did that clown-supreme, William II. But it was not the latter alone who was responsible for the war of 1914. And if, abroad, he was considered solely to blame for this war and, in his own country, for the defeat which followed, this was fully to the advantage of the Prusso-Teutonic circles. The latter thus escaped blame from two sources—which would have been a devastating blow fo r them had they acted directly and openly. Under the Cloak Because of the great variety in the apparent aims pursued by the Prusso-Teutonic group over a period of centuries, the observer of German affairs has often been mistaken on the subject of the group's actual intentions. Thus the Prussians are at first allied with Austria—then they attack her so as to eliminate her from the Empire. Before 1870 they keep in the good graces of France—then at the first opportunity they"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"PRUSSIA COMES UP IN THE WORLD \"5 invade her. They speak of a \"Teutonic solidarity\" with Eng- land—and then call her their great est enemy. They envisage a reconstituted Poland in order to make Russia powerless— and later conclude a temporary alliance with Russia permit- ting the occupation of Poland. Sometimes the men who speak in the name of Prusso-Teu- tonic Germany are replaced by others and the change in aims is explained by the personal pr eferences cf these men. The world is thus reassured, made to believe that Germany is abandoning her ancient plans due to the influence of new leaders. But even where a leader keeps his place, although the avowed aims have changed, the world is time and again taken in by the illusion that Germany is finally limiting her aims, and that she is no longer to be considered as dangerous as people imagined her. This was the reasoning during the period of calm between 1870 and 1914 (which calm, as we have seen, was necessary for Pr ussia to strengthen her domin- ion over Germany); in the years which followed the 1918 armistice; and most recently in the time between any two changes in Hitler's tactics. Sometimes these varied aims, these alleged \"oscillations\" as to the ends pursued in German politics, were simply tactical and designed to veil the real intentions of Germany. She would thus be in a much better position to make preparations in the direction she actually intended to take. But many of the changes in direction have been sincere. Frequently these periodical sh ifts in the \"German menace\" may be explained by the absolu te empiricism of the Prusso- Teutonic methods. It makes no difference what the immediate objective is so long as the final goal remains the same. If the matter of primary importance for Berlin had been the con- quest of France, Austria, Po land, Russia or England—her behavior, alternately friendly and threatening to each of these countries, may appear illogical.

Thus she can start action anywhere and con- tinue it, guided by opportunity, resistance and degree of failure encountered. The chess player, at the beginning of his game, does not generally know wh ich pieces he wants to win from his opponent first, but he knows his final goal quite well. The empiricism in the choice of her immediate objec- tives allows Germany better to hide her actual game and even to make interim allies of the countries to which such an alli- ance is acceptable. In the long run they will surely be de- voured, as were the others. In the quarter century between 1914 and 1939, the immedi- ate ends of Germany have ch anged somewhat, but the basic plan behind her actions has scarcely been altered. The venture of 1914 had failed by 1918. Was England called the major enemy during the World War—the enemy who was to be wiped out? This is of no importance. Since she proved to be the stronger, Germany would court her friendship over a period of years so that sh e might be ne utralized. To encourage England's confidence in her, Germany would first show a facade of peace, the German Republic. This was the strategy Germany employed . Through it she gained time to re-establish her forces. The n—since the facade had served its purpose and was now a nuisance—she removed it and erected another, more threatening than any of the ancient ones. This fagade is Hitler and Nazism—a facade very valuable today to the Prusso-Teutonic forces, but which could be sac- rificed over night as the others were, if such sacrifice would be to the advantage of the real leaders of Germany.

The Prusso-Teutonic caste, co mposed of Junkers, officers and officials, had been well serv ed by the Hohenzollerns. First they brought about the secularization of the Order's State and later, on the initiative of Bismarck, achieved complete Prusso- Teutonic seizure of the whole of Germany.

It was also necessary to eliminate the leaders of the democratic parties. To gain time it would be necessary to hold friendly rela- tions with England for a while and in the meantime to pre- pare for other conquests. But for many years the Prusso- Teutonic forces could pay no attention to foreign politics because internal political problems in Germany more urgently demanded solutions, and these ha d to be worked out method- ically. Could the Rightist parties, ma ny of whose members were faithful servants of the Prusso-Teutonic forces, no longer be useful in the Reichstag, as in Bismarck's time? Granted—but what difference would this ma ke? The Prusso-Teutonics did not intend to bother with the Reichstag—they would use methods completely opposite to those of parliament. More- over, methods of this type would be closer to the traditions of the Prusso-Teutonic group than would any parliamentary procedure.

The Fehme was a sort of secret society which set itself up as a tribunal in all"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 119 matters. Its members were at the same time judges and execu- tors of decisions. In the three and a half years following the Armistice, from 1919 to June 24, 1922, the date of Rathenau's murder, some 354 political assassinations were perpetrated in Germany by the various \"national revival\" organizations. For only two of these crimes, the assassinations of Rathenau and Eisner, was any punishment meted out, and this was extremely light. Despite the fact that the various State police forces were officially republican organiza tions, usually they allowed the assassins to escape. In those cases, however, where the killers were actually arrested by overzealous officials, they were acquitted, or at best fined or condemned to imprisonment for a ridiculously small period on some silly ground, for example, the carrying of guns without a permit. Count Arco, who had assassinated Eisner, leader of the Bavarian Left, was sentenced to death in January, 1920, but his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. This actually consisted in his doing some vague farm work near the prison. Finally on April 13, 1924, his sentence was suspended and he was set free. Shortly thereafter he was appointed director of the \"Sueddeutsche Lufthansa,\" a major aviation concern controlled by the Reich. These assassinations occurred w ith a regularity that baffled the general public, and yet they seemed to be part of an organized plan. Soon people began to speak of the \"Fehme\" in connection with these crimes, comparing the assassinations with the \"executions\" of the notorious secret German tribunal of past centuries—wh ich the recent crimes resembled in many respects. In 1920, 1922, 1924 and in 1931, the German writer, E. J. Gumbel, published works which attempted to expose the organizations responsible for these outrages, and to draw the attention of the German public to the criminal complicity of the judicial machinery of the Reich and the other authorities with the Fehme murderers. In his four books, Gumbel assem-"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"120 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY bled considerable documentation concerning these post- war \"executions.\" But his appe als and warnings were in vain, and the Fehme was able to continue its activities un- hindered. Despite public belief to the contrary, Gumbel did not relate these crimes to the bl ood tribunal of the Middle Ages. He considered the word \"Fehme\" simply an expression well chosen by the murderers to point up the actual resemblance between the two institutions. We shall probably never know exactly what information was contained in the heavy file the Bavarian deputy, Karl Gareis,* had planned to present to the Bavarian Landtag concerning the political crimes of that time. A few days after he announced hi s intention of discussing the material he had assembled, he wa s shot to death in the street. The two men who participated in his assassination escaped and were never apprehended. In any case, we know this much: that Gareis had spoken of a \"conspiracy going back a thousand years\" which he intended to reveal. He must have been referring to one of the only two German organizations which stemmed from the Middle Ages: the Fehme and the Teutonic Order. The history of the Fehme tribunals was independent of that of the Teutonic Knights. The Or der had always claimed that it did not have to submit to the jurisdiction of the terrible Fehme. But actually the frightful practices of the Fehme had widely penetrated among the Or der's circles. Kotzebue re- lated, in speaking of the Grand Master Winrich von Knip- rode, that at his time many Comthurs (regional commanders) of the Order were members of the Fehme, and the Grand Master himself was suspected of being one of its leaders. \"One morning, two Knights who were beyond reproach were found hanging from an oak tree outside Marienburg—marked by the Fehme,\" says Kotzebue. \"The Grand Master was asked to prosecute the murderers.

Finally, people believed th at the organization must have been dissolved, despite the fact that no laws or decrees sus- pending or condemning its practices had ever been promul- gated. But whether or not the Fehme, as a regularly consti- tuted organization, actually survived until 1918 is of but rela- tive importance. In any event, its Middle Age practices were well remembered in the spoken traditions of many German families. When, following the Ar mistice of 1918, the Prussian Junker organizations decided to revive these bloody practices, they were well aware of the traditional streams that might be tapped in the interests of their cause. They used methods which evoked familiar memories throughout Germany. A Thousand-Year-Old Conspiracy What were these notorious traditions of the Fehme? They were founded on the old Germ an law giving all \"manorial lords\" the right to judge freely over their serfs. This practice was maintained particularly in Westphalia. In a later, undeter- mined period* it gave rise to the secret tribunal of the \"Holy Fehme\"—a tribunal which meted out but a single kind of punishment, the death sentence. The Fehme originated from a pre-Christian, pagan moral conception, despite the fact that it claimed to be Christian. This institution served no more of a religious purpose than did the Teutonic Order, despite the religious facade which both organizations had found useful at their inception. (At the time of their foundation all institutions had to be Christian.)

The existence of the Fehme was known, but its operations were secret. It was subject to no authority except the Emperor's. The latter, at a time not clearly defined in German histor y, had delegated this author- ity to the Archbishop of Cologne who was head of the Fehme, at least nominally. Indeed th e Fehme tribunal had among its principal official tasks the punishment of crimes against reli- gion; but in practice its activity was entirely different. The Fehme soon became simply a means of terror against all individuals who might be in personal conflict with mem- bers of this powerful secret organization. The Christian ap- pearance it assumed was but a cloak; and, moreover, in no other Christian country was ther e a similar organization. The Fehme was of purely German conception, and the morality underlying its judgments was a Teutonic morality in direct contradiction to the principles and customs of Christianity. In common with the Teutonic Order the Fehme affected Christian aims; yet beneath this disguise—so suitable to the times—it pursued ends which were purely Teutonic. The survival in Germany of the traditions of these two institutions based on pre-Christian morality —the Teutonic Order and the Fehme—provides the only satisfact ory explanation for a series of contradictory phenomena by 'which Germany, in her re- cent history, has so frequently confused the people of western civilization.

The Red Earth The tribunals of the Middle Age Fehme operated in West- phalia, but they claimed jurisd ictional power over all of Ger- many. Westphalian \"Freigrafs\" pr esided over the meetings of the Fehme. They said that their families had received this privilege from Charlemagne, and that they had ro hold sessions exclusively on Westphalian soil. In the characteristically sym- bolic language of all Middle Ages secret associations, Wesr- phalian soil was designated as \"Die rote Erde\" (the Red Earth)—(an expression associated perhaps with the blood spilled in the course of Fehme judgments) and it was stated that the tribunal of the Fehme was always to hold court on \"Red Earth.\" (It is interesting to note that one of the most in- fluential Nazi newspapers, publis hed in Westphalia, is called Die Rote Erde.) In the course of judgment, the Freigraf was assisted by the Freischoeffen (jurors). It was under the name \"Freischoeffe\" that each Fehme member was known. All Fehme members were therefore qualified to par ticipate in judgment. But the Freischoeffen were not only judges or jurors; they were hang- men as well. In effect they we re charged with executing judg- ments pronounced by themselves or by other Freischoeffen. At one time it was estimated that ther e were over 100,000 Freischoeffen in all of Germany. Actually, while the Fehme tribunal functioned only in We stphalia, the Freischoeffen, who were its police and executionary organs, were present everywhere, scattered throughout the various German coun- tries. The Freischoeffen kept their functions absolutely se- cret, identifying each other by secret signs.

Its occult aspect contributed largely to increasing the terror which the Fehme inspired over all of Germany. There were a great number of Fehme tribunals in West- phalia. Generally they held se ssions on some elevated spot beneath an old tree—preferably a linden. The Freigraf and his Freischoeffen sat there before a large table on which was placed an unsheathed sword and a rope. The plaintiff and the witnesses had to swear by the sword, while the rope was used for execution of sentence. If a complaint against someone was made by a Freischoeffe before a Fehme tribunal (Freis choeffen alone were allowed to appear as plaintiffs before the Fehme) a summons was issued against the accused. The latter rarely responded to the sum- mons since it was well known with what difficulty acquittal was obtained; and further that but one type of punishment was decreed by the Fehme—the death penalty. If the accused did not make an appearance, the plaintiff had the right to bring him in by force from any section of Ger- many, seizing him with the assistance of his \"Eideshelfer\" (sworn deputies), who were witnesses in support of the orig- inal complaint and who were, in addition, his deputies. Originally it seems that only two witnesses for the plaintiff were necessary, but la ter the number was raised to six. The defendant might try to clear himself by having his own Eides- helfer, or \"witnesses of defense,\" sworn m in greater number than the witnesses of accusation sworn in for the plaintiff. But the latter could neutralize such effect by increasing in turn the number of his own witnesses. The number of witnesses al- lowed to the defense and the prosecution was fixed by law as two, six, thirteen or twenty. If one party produced two witnesses, the other party had to produce not less than six in order to have a chance to win his case, since any other num- ber would not be recognized by the court. In turn the oppos- ing party had to produce thirteen witnesses, so that he might"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 125 win ar least a temporary advantage from the other side. His opponent, finally, in order to wi n his case, would have to produce twenty. If the plaintiff succeeded in presenting twenty Frcischoeffen in support of his complaint, no defense witnesses in greater number were allowed and a death sen- tence was made mandatory. The witnesses had to swear to the effect that they knew the plaintiff well as an honest man and his word was good enough for them if he accused the defendant. On the other hand, witnesses for the defendant would swear that they knew him to be innocent. The plaintiffs and the defendants always had to swear in addition to their own witnesses. Consequently the total number of oaths administer ed was three and seven {num- bers which appear frequently in the symbolism of the Middle Ages), or fourteen and twenty-one (multiples of seven). This all made for progressive \"outbidding\" in the number of wit- nesses. It was underst ood, however, that witnesses for either side had to be Freischoeffen. For one who was not himself an influential Freischoeffe it was obviously difficult to find suffi- cient numbers of other Freischoeffen prepared to swear on his behalf. Since the plaintiff was of necessity a Freischoeffe, the defendant, even if he was hims elf a member of the Fehme and particularly if he was not, was already at a disadvantage when he presented himself before the tribunal. Where the defendant was presen t, the death sentence was carried out at once. The Freischoeffen, co-judges of the tri- bunal, seized the condemned man and hanged him from the nearest tree. If the accused deemed it prudent to stay away, or if the summons could not be served on him, the Freigraf, president of the tribunal, would call for a \"heimliche Acht\" or \"secret session.\" Indeed it was considered important to keep the pro- cedures secret, particularly in cases where the accused was absent.

If, af ter convening in secret session, it was noticed that an outside r, a non-Freischoeffe, remained in the vicinity (every outsider was supposed to leave), the Freigraf would stand up, call the man, place the rope around the neck of the unfortunate fellow and have him hanged from the nearest tree by the Freischoeffen. Such action was taken even where the outsider did not realize that he might be tres- passing. After having ascertained that the defendant had not ap- peared, the Freigraf had his name called out four times, and then asked if anyone were present to defend the accused. Next, the plaintiff swore to the truth of his accusation, and his witnesses in turn took an oath, declaring that they believed the plaintiff incapable of perjury. The proof was thus con- sidered sufficient, and sentence was pronounced. The Knife in the Tree According to ancient law-books of the Fehme, the Freigraf pronounced sentence in the following formula: \"The defendant by the name of 'X': I hereby deprive him of peace and of the rights and liberties granted by Kaiser Charlemagne and approved by Pope Leo; and further attested under oath by all princes, nobl es, knights and vassals, freemen and Freischoeffen in Westphal ia; and depose him and set him outside of all peace, all liberty and all right s, by virtue of the King's ban and malediction, ab andoning him to the greatest misery and disgrace; and ma ke him unworthy, outlawed, deprived of his seal, disho norable, without peace and not entitled to share in the common law; and abduct him and 'verfehme' him [put him under the curse of the Fehme] according to the rules of the 'heimliche Acht' [secret tri- bunal]; and vow his neck to the rope and his corpse to the beasts and the birds of the air—to be eaten by them until nothing remains; and commit his soul to God in Heaven in"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 127 His authority; and vacate his life and property; and his wife shall be widowed and his children orphans.\" Here is the procedure which followed, according to the prescriptions contained in the books of the Fehme: \"The Freigraf shall take the rope which is braided from willow switches and throw it outside the tribunal, and then all Freischoeffen standing in presence of the tribunal shall spit, as though the outlaw were to be hanged within that very hour. Following this, the Freigraf shall command all Frei- grafen and Freischoeffen, reminding them of their oaths and their honor as members of the 'heimliche Acht,' obliging them, the moment they have seized the outlaw, to hang him from the nearest tree, according to all their strength and might.\" The Freigraf now handed the plaintiff a document which by his seal confirmed the sent ence, and in which all Fehme members were requested to lend him their support in the execution of sentence. The bearer of this document departed immediately in search of his victim, being careful not to men- tion his mission to anyone, with the exception of other Frei- schoeffen, lest the condemned be warned in time, and flee from punishment, Frequently the condemned lived in a part of Germany at some distance from Westphalia. This made no difference, since Freischoeffen were found everywhere, and it was the duty of each, were he so requested, to assist in the execution. He was first to look over the official sentence which bore the seal of the Freigraf; or if such document were lacking, it would suffice for three other Freischoeffen to swear before him that the individual being pursued had actu- ally been outlawed by the Fehm e. Having thus received the requested proof, he could not neglect his duty, even if the condemned were his best fri end or his own brother. The execution was usually carried out by three or four Freischoeffen. They would seize the condemned, who in most cases was not, until that moment, aware of his having been"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"128 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY sentenced by the Holy Fehme. Without further ado he was then hanged from the nearest tree. In order to make clear that this was no ordinary crime but an act of the Fehme, a knife was stuck into the tree. Wher e the condemned resisted, the Freischoeffen had the right to kill him in any manner possible. In such cases they would hang his cadaver—and, as usual, stick the knife into the tree. It happened from rime to t ime that a Freischoeffe, having learned of the condemnation of one of his friends, would try to warn him discreetly so that he might escape, even though he knew that he thus risked his own life. The harmless words pronounced casually: \"It's just as well to eat one's bread else- where than here,\" became a formula whose significance was understood by non-initiates. Such was the fear inspired by the Fehme over all Germany that if these words were ad- dressed to any man—even if he were the most influential citizen in town—and if he understood their meaning, he would gather whatever possessions he could and overnight would become a vagabond, travelling under an assumed name, living the rest of his days fa r from his wife and children. If it became known that some one had been outlawed by the Fehme, no other individual would dare to help him, for by being seen in the company of someone sought by the Fehme he would be risking hi s life. The condemned man, abandoned by all, would hide where he could until he was finally discovered by the Fehme. The range of crimes coming under the jurisdiction of the Fehme was extremely wide. In line with contemporary thought, crimes against religion and the Ten Commandments are mentioned first, despite the fact that no evidence is found that the Fehme ever functioned as a religious tribunal. Follow- ing this are enumerated \"all crimes against honor and law— treason, murder, robbery, perjury, defamation, rape, and abuse of power.\" The intentions of those who had originally as- signed to the Fehme jurisdiction over these crimes were no"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 129 doubt excellent, but in practice anyone coming in personal conflict with a member of the Fehme risked condemnation by the blood tribunal; for it was always simple to discover a \"crime against honor\" as a basis for accusation, and an influ- ential Freischoeffe had no diffic ulty in finding others to pre- sent as witnesses, supporting his accusations. The Noose Around The Neck The slightest betrayal of Fehme secrets by a Freischoeffe was punished by death, and in such cases execution took place without a trial. On this subjec t we read the following in the Fehme law-books: \"If a Freischoeffe brings into the open the secrets and password of the 'secret tribunal' [heimliche Acht] or tells out- siders anything of this, whethe r small or large portions, then he shall be seized without trial by the Freigraf and Freischoef- fen who will tie his hands togeth er before him, place a cloth over his eyes, throw him on his belly and rip his tongue from out of his throat; a three-strand rope is to be slipped around his neck and he shall be hanged seven feet higher than a condemned 'Verfehmt', outlawed criminal.\" Non-initiates who tried to discover the secrets of the Fehme, or who simply dared to glance at a Fehme document, were led before the tribunal and executed on the spot. Those books and archives of the Fehme which have survived until today carry a strict warning that anyone opening them who is not a Freischoeffe is subject to jurisdiction of the secret tri- bunal. The fear which such methods inspired was so great that even in the nineteenth cen tury one could still find un- opened Fehme documents in th e German archives, their Fehme seals unbroken. They bear the inscription: \"No one is allowed to read, or to have read to him this letter, unless he be a true Freischoeffe of the secret tribunal [der heimlichen beschlossenen Acht] of the Holy Roman Empire.\""},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"130 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The Freischoeffen were granted such broad powers chat they could execute any man, even without trial before the tribunal, if three Freischoeffen saw the accused in the very act of committing a crime punishable by the Fehme. Further, the confession of a crime was considered equivalent to its actually having been witnessed. Thus if someone boasted in the presence of several persons that he had committed any of the crimes under the jurisdiction of the Fehme, without realizing that at least three of such individuals were Frei- schoeffen, the latter were re quired—at the first opportunity they might find to do so w ithout being discovered—to seize the man and hang him from the nearest tree. We can well imagine the number of abuses to which such methods gave rise. The terror spread by the Fehme proved at the same time to be its best recruiting agent. To be a member of the Fehme was considered insurance, at least to a certain extent, against being unjustly condemned by the secret tribunal. In effect, it was always easier for a Freischoeffe to defend himself than it was for an outsider. In the early days, when a Freischoeffe was accused he could clear his name by swearing his innocence. Later this advantage was withdr awn, and all defendants, re- gardless of their affiliation, had to present a sufficient number of witnesses in their defense. Yet obviously an influential Freischoeffe would much more easily find a gr eat number of witnesses among his fellow Fr eischoeffen than would a non- member of the Fehme. While in the early days, the Freigrafen had seen to it that only men of unimpeachable virtue were to be admitted to Fehme membership, at a later time men of doubtful moral character invaded the ranks of the Freischoeffen. The oppor- tunity to do as one pleased was so appealing that all sorts of adventurers did everything in their power to become members of the Fehme. One can visualize the reign of terror which followed as a consequence, and the blackmail, abuse, and mean"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 131 vengeance which it was possible ro practice under the cloak of the Fehme. A man innocent of any crime would awaken ro find a summons stuck to his door by some unknown person, calling for his appearance on a spec ific day before this or that rribunal of the Fehme. Such men knew that certain death awaited them there, and that they had better flee, or hide themselves as best they coul d. Another who had never been served by summons would one da y unexpectedly be seized by three Freischoeffen, not aware that he had been condemned by the Fehme until he felt the noose around his neck. The Junkers and the Fehme This barbaric institution had terrorized Germany for cen- turies. One can imagine what services it could render to an unscrupulous group pursuing its own purposes and it was in- evitable that such an institution should become the instrument for all sorts of private intere sts. When the Fehme returned to Germany following the 1918 Armistice, its reappearance was due to the initiative of two groups of interests, the Junkers and the leaders of heavy industry in Westphalia. In any event, every clue to the crimes of the revived Fehme uncovered by German tribunals or contemporary newspapers in their exposures led directly either to the Junkers or to heavy industry. Financing of the organizations responsible for the Fehmic crimes came from one or the other of these groups. A number of such crimes were committed on the very estates of the Junkers where numerous Fehme units were in hiding, available for Fehme activities. Moreover, the Prusso-Teutonic Junkers and officers seem to have been very directly involved in these crimes—to have been the immediate instigators. The role of the leaders of heavy industty was probably to finance such projects. This cooperation consolidated the strange alliance which had been established between two such different economic"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"132 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY groups—Westphalian heavy i ndustry and the Junkers—the existence of one based on the mo st modern industrial methods, of the other on the most backward exploitation. In a description of the Prusso-Teutonic group of today, one really must include the heads of these industries, together with the Junkers, officers and o fficials previously cited. At the time of the Teutonic Order, nothing comparable to heavy industry existed. Today this indus try is a force with which the descendants of the Order must reckon. There may have been some economic friction between the two groups during the period after World War I, when there was rivalry in connec- tion with tariffs on agricultur al products and manufactured goods. This, however, disappeared completely when Germany in 1931 established a system of absolute protectionism based on exchange control, which benefits equally both groups- big industrialists and landowners —-at the expense of mercan- tile interests, small farmers and consumers. The warlike at- mosphere dear to the Prusso-Teutonics is equally desirable to heavy industry, the logical supplier of munitions. (We shall draw no conclusions from the curious coincidence that the leaders of heavy industry in Germany are descendants of old Westphalian families. There is good reason to believe that in the Middle Ages their ancestors were members, perhaps even chiefs, of the Fehme movement, of Westphalian origin. In any case it is curious to note this fact concerning the alli- ance between the junkers and heads of Westphalian heavy industry: these two groups are present-day descendants of men who participated in the two German institutions whose traditions most directly oppose Western civilization, the Teu- tonic Order and the Fehme.) The renewal of the Fehme seemed to rest with the Junkers whose secret \"self-defense\" societies stemmed in a direct line from the ancient Society of Lizards and indirectly from the Teutonic Order. These societies were in a position to make an immediate decision to revive the Fehme terror—which was"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 133 indispensable to their aims—and th en to organize it at once. Such a reign of terror would never have spread spontane- ously, nor could it have resu lted from the decision of a few members of the same caste on the spur of the moment. The principal aim was to execute, one by one, the leaders of the young German Republic. Almost overnight the nu- merous sub-organizations, func tioning under various names, became executors of the restored Fehme. Through their good offices hundreds of democratic leaders were put to death in post-war Germany. In the democratic nations outside of Ger- many, no attention was paid to these murders because they were considered a German \"internal affair.\" All Fehme assassinations after 1918 can be traced back to the same organizations. The tw o groups which were the exec- utors par excellence of Fehmic crimes were the \"C\" Organ- ization (Consul) and the Rossbach Organization. All clues led to them. But the men active in both these organizations often figured as well in the activities of other societies or associ- ations, all of which seemed to be pursuing the same ends and carrying out the same instructions. E. J. Gumbel, recognized specialist in the history of German political crimes after 1918, whom we have mentioned earlier, explains as follows the entanglement of interests existing among these various groups: \"The official program as well as the name [of these organi- zations] changes in accordance with what seems politically the most appealing at the moment. The real tendency, how- ever, remains the same. Therefore it would be wrong to assume that all these societies existed individually side by side. In many cases one rose from a nother, and societies with en- tirely different names might be identical. For the same in- dividuals made it a practice to hold simultaneous membership in a whole list of associations. \"The constant change of names often serves the purpose of veiling the complete structure of the organizations so as to"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"134 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY make practically ineffective any dissolution by order of the government or under pressure of public opinion. The pur- pose of the founding of new societies under new names and with new members was often to exclude those individuals who were no longer considered completely trustworthy, with- out provoking the enmity of such individuals by specifically expelling them.\" The number of persons engage d in these activities cannot properly be estimated by adding up the members of the vari- ous existing associations, since there are numerous duplications in their lists. We can figure that at the most 200,000 individ- uals were active members of such organizations. Here are the names of some of the societies of this character which abounded at this epoch. They often assumed profes- sional or athletic guises, bur al ways pursued the same secret ends.

When this curious fact was revealed in the course of the various trials and investigations concerning Fehme crimes in Ge rmany, the public accepted without a murmur the too easy explanation that the war had lowered the moral standards of the combatants. In reality this state of affairs was due to not hing so simple, but to deeper causes: the Prussian officers, fa ithful members of the Prusso- Teutonic Caste were themselves obliged to take charge of these delicate tasks of the Fe hme assassinations , since they were the only \"men of arms\" within the caste. In the tradi- tional way of doing things, th e other Junkers' role was to finance the various secret organizations with the aid of heavy industry and to provide them w ith hideouts on their estates; the officials who were devoted to the common cause were actively represented among the various police organizations, where they could help the assassins to escape, or if that proved impossible, to arrange, as prosecu tors or judges, either their acquittal or their sentencing to an easy term. By 1918 Prusso- Teutonic affiliates could be found here and there among the officials of all German countries, even in places quite distant from Prussia. Since 1870 the Pr ussian spirit had had time to spread to a certain extent all over Germany. The \"bloody task,\" the actual killing, was considered the privilege of the officers—the descendants of the ancient Knights of the Order. The C Organization consisted primar- ily of former naval officers , the Rossbach Organization of army officers. Had a regular air force existed at the time of the first World War, it is probable that a third organization would have been formed, to be staffed by officers formerly active in that branch of service. In 1920, the anti-Republic fac tions in Germany attempted"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 137 a vague coup d'Etat, known as the \"Kapp Putsch.\" Corvette Captain Ehrhardt participated in this together with his naval brigade. Ehrhardt had succeeded in keeping this brigade in existence after 1918. He kept it functioning as an illegal organization. Its financing came through unknown interests whose identity can easily be guessed. A writ of arrest was issued against him in 1920 by authorities of the Republic but it was never executed. While the writ was still in effect Ehr- hardt moved freely about the corridors of the Reichswehr Ministry. The official purpose of his discussions in the Minis- try was \"to find employment fo r his men.\" His real purpose was to elaborate quietly a scheme for collaboration between the Reichswehr and the future organization he had decided to found by using the men of his brigade as a nucleus. Since direct action in the \"Kapp Putsch\" had not had satisfactory results, he planned from that time on to devote his efforts to under-cover action. The newly created \"C Organization,\" or \"Consul Organization,\" was named for Ehrhardt who was its leader: in the secret code of the association each member had a special name and Ehrhardt was called \"Consul.\" Outstanding Germans often tried to fight the Consul Or- ganization and the other secret associations, but in vain. On September 22, 1921, Dr. Trunk, President of the State of Baden, made the following revelations in the Diet of Baden concerning the by-laws and aims of the C Organiza- tion: \"The by-laws call for: \"(a) Spiritual aims: developm ent and dissemination of na- tional* thought; struggle against all anti-nationals and inter- nationalists; struggle against J udaism, Social-Democracy and * The word, \"national,\" is used here as the antonym of \"international.\" The German nationalistic circles cons idered the men behind the Weimar Constitution as 'internationalists' and they looked upon themselves as the only ones who thought in \"national\" terms."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"138 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY the radical left parties; str uggle against the anti-nationally conceived Weimar Constitution by word, writing and action; enlightenment of the widest po ssible circles of the popula- tion as to the real nature of this Constitution; support of the only possible constitution for Germany, one based on Federalism.* \"(b) Material aims: Organization of men among the armed forces determined to prevent the complete revolutionizing of Germany; the prevention, through constitution of a national government, of the recurrence of present-day conditions; and, as far as possible, the preservation of armed forces as well as armaments for the nation. \"The organization is a secret one, the members of which are bound for mutual defense and protection through a pact by which every member of the organization is assured of the utmost assistance from all other members.

I vow absolute obedi- ence to the highest Leader of the organization, and to observe utmost secrecy concerning all its affairs.'\" Daring the trial in 1924, follo wing the assassination of Rathenau, a zealous Reich pros ecutor, Ebermayer, spoke as follows about the activities of the C Organization: \"I believe it my duty to point out that during the time of the investigation of the case and even immediately before the trial, a certain number of fact s were produced which permit us to suppose and almost to c onclude that certain organiza- tions and societies are hiding behind the accused—and I go further, that they have perhaps inspired their crimes. I must emphasize above all that in all political outrages of the last few years, in the assassination of Erzberger, in the outrages against Scheidemann and in th e assassination of Rathenau, which concerns us here, the sa me circles—I might almost say the same individuals—have always been involved. In the assassination of Erzberger—Schul z and Tillessen play a role; in the attempt against the life of Scheidemann, the brother of Tillessen was active. Tillessen, Plaass, Fischer, Kern, Schulz, Techow—all these men are the same group. All have wide- spread personal contacts—either because they have known each other for a long time or because they are all members of the different organizations. Thus, whether or not it is to our liking, we gain the impression of running up against the links of a common chain—of a single association to which all these men are affiliated.\" During the trial, the C Organization was seldom mentioned by name. The fear which checked the witnesses, the prosecu- tion and the judges in speaking of it was clearly evident. The presiding judge mentioned, how ever, that during the closed hearings which had been orde red, the relationship between the C Organization and the Reic h Government was discussed."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"140 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Everyone understood that in rea lity the matter of discussion was the relationship between the C Organization and the Reichswehr—this in reference to secret rearmament. The trial was conducted in such a way as to establish that the C Organization had rendered important \"patriotic\" services in the cause of secret rearmame nt and that under these condi- tions it would be preferable not to insist on denouncing the assassinations, which were not crimes but Fehmic executions. Finally all the accused were set free. It is illuminating that in the following year, during another trial, the same prosecutor, Ebermayer, referred to the C Or- ganization in an entirely differ ent manner. To his mind, now, the Organization was not carrying on \"secret activity.\" It is true that it was struggling against the \"Weimar Constitution, but it was doing so through \"legal means.\" The intimidation of the Fehme had had its effect on the good prosecutor Eber- mayer during the time between these two trials. It has been established that there was a close connection between the Consul Organization and a whole series of asso- ciations serving as its \"front \" from time to time: Brueder vom Stein, Hauptverband der Sc hlesier, Bund der Aufrechten, Jungdeutscher Orden, Verband nationalgesinnter Soldaten, Nationalbund deutscher Offizi ere, Bayrische Holzverwer- tungsgesellschaft, Norddeutsche r Bund, a number of student societies and finally the Wikingbund (Viking Bund), an asso- ciation which had some importance. In 1,923, the Press Bureau of the Thuringian government characterized this Wikingbund as follows: \"It appears that the National Association of German Sol- diers, which was suppressed by la w, has given rise to a sub- stitute organization, the so-called Wikingbund, which at the same time functions as a branch of the Ehrhardt Brigade [Consul Organization].

The Wikingbund as the 'lates t edition' of the Consul Organization operating in Thuringia, inclusive of Prussian provinces, has been divided into eleven district sections which are directed from the regional office in the city of Erfurt. According to statements of individuals involved it has come out that there also exists a Fehme within the organization. The duty of the Fehme is to preser ve through the most rigorous methods the secret character of the organization and of its activities. Members who are suspected of being traitors or 'stool pigeons' are shot, according to various statements of people who have participated in such actions. In the well- known manner of such bunds the members have to swear 'life and death' obedience to their leaders. It has been fur- ther established, according to confessions of individuals who have been arrested, that one of the purposes of these organi- zations is also to put out of the way any leader or statesman of the Republic who upsets their plans.\" The by-laws of the Wikingbund, drawn up in 1923, con- tain conclusive proof as to the connections of this Bund (and indirectly of the C Organization) with the National-Socialist Party. Among these by-laws is written: \"The Bund is an association of industrious German men; it strives on a national basis, for a moral, cultural, economic and political rebirth of the German people. The leader of the Bund is its founder, who shall ha ve absolute authority. Mem- bership is open to anyone who is above reproach and who is of Aryan German descent. On entering the Bund, each new member must take the oath of allegiance to the leader and his aims, pledging himself irrevocably to obedience.

Reiter, Leader and Founder of the \"Wikingbund.\" A Job Well Done The C Organization as a unit, or its members, can be traced in most of the post-war assassinations of outstanding political personalities. In the regulations of the revived Fehme, where the \"punishment of traitors\" is mentioned, not only those who actually betray secrets of any of the organizations involved are intended. All who wanted Germany to take the path of democracy were considered \"traitors\"—traitors because they opposed the direction desired by the Prusso-Teutonics, the only direction \"worthy of a German\"—according to the very particular understanding of th is clique. Since they were traitors, they must be killed. . . . And as a result of this rea- soning, the German democratic leaders were all disposed of, one by one. Of course the Fehme had even better reasons for acting promptly in cases such as that of the Bavarian Deputy Gareis in 1921, when Gareis threatened to expose the Fehme crimes and those re sponsible for them. It must be admitted that the methods applied were effec- tive. By 1920 all the democratic parties had lost their leaders through assassination. Those who remained at the head of these parties were men who had neither power nor promi- nence—and they were terrorized. (It is thus not surprising that the German emigration which followed Hitler's acces- sion to power has not yet been able to produce an able leader from among the German statesme n of the different demo- cratic parties.) Thus the stage was set for the seizure of power by a group which would control Germany a ccording to the desires of the Prusso-Teutonics and which would serve as a front to the latter. The Nazi Party, which was one of the candidates for this role, was mentioned more and more frequently. Less"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 143 and less was said about the Fehme crimes and the Consul Organization. Since the tasks en trusted to this organization had been finished the latter could now sink into oblivion. By 1930 we can find the men who had been Ehrhardt's trusted lieutenants occupying important posts in the Navy, in the Administrative offices of the Admiralty and in the General Staff of the Fleet. Wern er Tillessen, one of the fore- most \"men of many tasks\" in the Consul Orga nization, whose name, together with that of his brother, had figured fre- quendy during the course of most of the trials involving Fehme assassinations, was by then Vice-Admiral, Services rendered were well paid! When th e officers had accomplished their tasks as Fehme assassins, they returned to the Army or the Navy—holding higher rank than before because of time passed in the performance of \"duties of a special nature.\" The Black Reichswehr While the staff of the Consul Organization consisted of naval officers, that of the Rossbach Organization was com- posed of army officers. Both organizations worked hand and glove. No difficulties arose be tween them, and from time to time they lent each other their strong-arm men. The ab- sence of conflict between th ese two terrorist groups, which one might expect to find competing with one another, can easily be explained by the fact that both organizations were acting in separate spheres but on behalf of the same control- ling interests. The C Organization was concerned primarily with dispos- ing of major political figures—men in the public eye. The Rossbach Organization was dedicated to the execution of lesser lights, who might hinder the Junkers as well as the day-by-day work of secret rearmament. The C Organization functioned throughout Germany, and was particularly active in areas where a certain strengthening of the democratic"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"i44 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY parties, was noticed. The Rossbach Organization was more active in Prussia itself, looking after the local interests of the Junkers, on whose estates the units of the organization had been set up. Therefore the connections of the Rossbach Organization with the junkers, were of necessity more ap- parent than those maintained with the same interests by the C Organization. The Rossbach Organization was founded in December, 1918, by Lieutenant Gerhard Rossbach of the 175th Infantry Regiment with the remnants of his regiment. He tried to keep together the men who rallied around him after the debacle by hiding them on the estates of the East-Prussian landlords. Out of this a few months, later Rossbach formed a \"Sturmtruppe\" (assault troop), now admitting to membership officers and soldiers from all the armed forces. The Rossbach forces called themselves an \"Arbeitsgemein schaft\" (work cooperative) to conceal the military character of their organization from the Armistice Commission. They were to be placed in small units on the estates of the Junkers where they would carry out their activities. The Junkers had decided to hide on their estates the imple- ments of war which the army was able to salvage after Ger- many's defeat. For the Prusso-Teutonics these were a power- ful trump, to be used in the future reconstruction of their forces. They had no doubts as'to this reconstruction, although they did not yet see clearly th e exact form it would take. It is enlightening that the secret rearming, which was being carried on in defiance of the Armistice Commission, took place mainly on the very estates of the Junkers (i.e., in the only section of Germany controlled entirely by the Prusso- Teutonics). It is also interest ing that all Junkers thus placed their lands at the disposal of the cause without a moment's hesitation; and that not one traitor was to be found among them who dared to oppose the shouldering of these obliga- tions or to carry tales to the democratic parties. The reason"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 145 for this lay in the strict secr et organization of the Junkers. If this secret organization had not existed, a simple \"community of interests,\" would certainly not have been enough to force decisions so rapidly and to insu re secrecy and perfect synchro- nization of all actions. The only leakage which the J unkers had reason to fear might have come from their fa rm workers. The latter, of course, unlike the Junkers, were not bound by the secrecy of the Junker organizations. They were, further, in a position to know and reveal the spots where arms had been hidden. It was a question, then, of terrorizi ng these workers and impressing on them the fact that by talking too much they would be risking the wrath of the Fehm e. The organization of this Fehme unit was the task of the various \"work cooperatives\" composed of ex-service men. Among these \"cooperatives,\" the Rossbach Organization soon became outstanding by virtue of the initiative and ruthlessness of its leader. Collectively these secret unit s were known as the \"Black Reichswehr.\" Indeed, their purpose was to keep together the staffs of the former army. These staffs could not remain in the official Reichswehr, which had been considerably reduced in accordance with the terms of the Armistice. A close liaison was maintained between the two Reichswehr. This was con- siderably facilitated by the fact that officers of both were serving the same cause and obeying the same orders. An Honorable Enterprise The Rossbach Organization established central offices in Berlin. It was from here that recruiting was carried on and that contact was maintained with leaders of the Reichswehr.

They were obedient to the strictest military discipline, going so far as to snap into \"at attention\" in the presence of their superior offi- cers, although they were generally in mufti. Despite the name, \"Work Cooperative,\" they were not concerned with any actual work. In a tight spot, however, the Rossbach volunteers were prepared to furnish large armed forces at almost a moment's notice. Petty Executions The responsibility of the Ro ssbach Organization for some of the assassinations was clearly established in the course of trials which also ended without any significant results. The democratic press conducted inquiri es and made some interest- ing revelations. Gumbel tried ve ry hard to demonstrate the connecting links between all thes e Fehme assassinations but his efforts did not arouse public opinion. In July, 1920, the non-commissi oned officer Max Krueger, of the Rossbach corps stationed at Stecklin, learned that one of the farm workers, Willi Schmidt, age twenty, wanted to abandon his job—and that it was being whispered in the vil- lage that he intended to inform the police of the spot where certain secret arms had been cached. The local Fehme of the Rossbach corps decided to take action immediately. Four members of the organization, Heines, Bandemer, Vogt and Ottow, paid a visit to Schmidt, pretending to be police inspectors. Intimidated, Schmidt left with them, supposedly to attend a hearing at the police station. Actually he was led to an isolated spot in the vicinity and there Ottow beat him over the head with a blackjack. It was decided to take him to the Kehrberg forest and his wounds were dressed.

At last Hemes ordered Baer to shoot Schmidt. Baer could not quite make up his mind, so Hemes himself shot at Schmidt twice. He was joined by Ottow, who also fired twice. Schmidt still had sufficient strength to cry out for help. He was knocked down and his face was pushed into the ground. Fraebel trampled on his head and finally Ottow finished him off with ten raps of the blackjack. Baer now dug a pit in which the corpse was buried. But the pit was not deep enough. A few days later the knees of the victim pushed up out of the ground and people in the neigh- borhood began to speak of the a ssassination. Af ter that the assassins went back to the grave and buried their victim in a much deeper pit. Walter Cadow, age twenty-three, employed as overseer on an estate at Wismar in Meckle nburg, had been admitted into membership in the local Rossbach volunteers, having been a second lieutenant during the war. After some time he was suspected of intending to turn witness against the Rossbach Organization, in 3 trial concerning the Organization's activi- ties, then in session. On May 31, 1913, following previous arrangements, mem- bers of the local Fehme got him drunk, and then all his papers were removed. It wa s midnight. He was placed in a car with eight men, who, under the co mmand of Second Lieutenant Hoess, held their guns against him. The car was driven out to the woods.

The entire gang trampled him with booted feet."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE FEHME MURDERS 149 One of these men, Wiedemeyer, slit his throat, and Second Lieutenant Hoess finally killed him with a bullet in the head. Jurisch, one of the members of this particular unit, later became remorseful and recounted the incident to the Vor- waerts—socialist newspaper of Berlin. The crime was thus brought to the attention of the attorney-general, who could not refuse to act. Two minor helpers in the assassination, as well as the informer, were arrested. Finally all three were released. The local chief of the Rossbach Organization hurriedly transported those who had participated in the assassination to other estates in Upper Silesia. He thus made sure that the affair would have no further repercussions. Later it was learned that he reprimanded Hoess, leader of the unit, severely: \"If you had been a member of the Rossbach Organ- ization for a longer time, you would have known how such affairs should be handled. Two men and one bullet—at night in the woods—are all that is needed.\" Around 1922-1923, the Rossbach Organization found means of introducing its methods into the Reichswehr itself. In numerous areas throughout Germany, local cells were organized within the regular army. These cells were named \"Reichswehrblock Rossbach\" (R. W. B. R.)—Rossbach Reichswehr Section. Indiscreti ons had exposed the relations between the Rossbach Organization and a certain regiment of Magdeburg. Following this, the lo cal R. W. B.

The magazine Das andere Deutschl and published in its issue of January, 1927, the following \"confession\": \"I, the undersigned, Hubert Caida, worker at Wreschen, was, in 1921, a member of th e 'self-defense' organization, section Dedewitzhof, near to Tw erkau, district of Ratibor.

On the road from Dedewitzhof to Twerkau, Miketta walked a fe w steps in front of us, his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe, and without suspicion. We said that we would accompany him right up to the door of his house where his wife aw aited his return.

Despite protestations by the Sergeant, who showed his papers to the policeman, the latter conducted Pannier to the police station. The commis- sioner there telephoned the general staff of the Third Army Division, requesting instructions. He was told that a. second lieutenant would be sent over imme diately to call for Pannier. Later a second lieutenant and another man presented them- selves to the commissioner, and they took custody of Pannier, whom they then led away. The commissioner did not realize that the officer was really Second Lieutenant Benn of the Black Reichswehr. (In the course of the trial, where these in- cidents were revealed, it was never explained how a telephone call to the general staff of a regular division of the German army could have led to the dispatching of men of the Black Reichswehr.) Two days later, on orders of Benn, Pannier was killed in the woods with an axe by Sergeant Schirmann and Privates Aschenkampf and Stein. The day following the crime, Schirmann left for Berlin carrying a letter addressed to Li eutenant Paul Schulz, whose name figures in many of thes e assassinations. Schulz seems to have been one of the principal organizers of the Black Reichs- wehr Fehme. Sergeant Fahlbusch, who made accusations against Schulz during the course of a trial of Fehme crimes, was later, in January, 1931, found asphyxiated in a motor boat. His death was never cleared up. The Nazis and the Fehme It is curious to observe the relationship between the post- war Fehme organizations and th e Nazi party. That numerous murderers from the C Organization, the Rossbach Organiza- tion and the various detachment s of the Black Reichswehr became members of the Nazi party around 1930, is in itself not astonishing. It can be ex plained simply by the general"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"152 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY attraction which the party held for the masses, and particu- larly among nationalis t elements. But we have seen how, as early as 1923, the Wikingbund, closely connected to the C Organization, adopted in its statutes the program of the National-Socialist party as its political ideal. On the other hand, Rossbach was official representative for Hitler in North Germany during this same period. When the police of Thur- ingia on January 26, 1923, arrested 373 members of the Rossbach Organization, including forty officers (as related in the Frankfurter Zeitung of January 28, 1923), it was discov- ered that all of them were to report to the Congress of the National-Socialist party, convening in Munich. The police found numerous guns and blackjacks on the men, and in many cases they wore uniforms beneath their civilian clothes. A great many of them wore swastikas. In 1923, the Nazi party was not yet as feared and as influ- ential as it was to be at a later time. Nevertheless the two powerful Fehme associations, the C Organization and the Rossbach Organization, maintained consistent connections with it. This was due only to the fact that all three organiza- tions were agencies acting for the same group of interests. The ties of the C Organizati on with the Junkers and with the Reichswehr, loyal servants of the Prusso-Teutonics, were clearly revealed during the course of various trials. That there was a connection between the Rossbach Organization and the Prussian landlords was an open secret, since almost all of their activity had taken place on la nds of the latter. It is clear that by maintaining a regular relationship with both organiza- tions, the Nazi party was cultivating its connections with the hidden powers which were at the same time behind both organizations—the entire Junker-Prussian clique. Yet there had been reason to believe from time to time that the Nazi movement would one day come to a head in a separatist revolt of the diffe rent German regions against Prussian centralization. This was true especially when Hitler"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE FEHME  MURDERS 153 - in the beginning of his movement—had close ties with the Bavarian separatists under the leadership of Kahr. The Num- ber Two leader of the Nazi pa rty, Gregor Strasser, thought he could maintain great inde pendence with respect to the Prusso-Teutonic forces. Captai n Roehm deluded himself with the idea that his \"Praetorian Guards,\" the S. A., were suffi- ciently strong to enable the party to realize its own ends without the necessity of submitting to any outside forces. Hitler himself, entirely without scruples, did not oppose his lieutenants. He welcomed all alliances, and all slogans, so long as these might be of value to him. Basically, he was never under any illusion as to what were the truly dominant forces in Germany. He knew very well that his assumption of power in Germany some day would be made possible only if he gave these forces absolute gua rantees that he would serve them faithfully from the moment he had the controls. Despite his passing flirtations in other directions, Hitler wisely maintained contacts with the Prusso-Teutonic ele- ments through Rossbach and Ehrhardt, and through his own henchman, Goering. This state of affairs continued until the time in 1932 and particularly in January, 1933, when he con- cluded a \"life and death\" allianc e with the junker forces. This became possible only after the \"neutralization\" of Hinden- burg, who alone among th ese elements had, up to that time, refused to approve the choice of the Austrian corporal as the \"super factotum\" selected to serve the Prussian cause. As early as 1924, when appearances ran counter to the con- clusion he set down, E. J. Gumb el in his book, Verschwoerer, published in Berlin, had written the following: \"In its deepest foundations, Nati onal-Socialism contains but little more than Prussian militarism.\""},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH T H E I R GOAL O N THE FIRST OF O CTOBER , 1927, two extremely dignified gentlemen in frock coats and striped trousers called on Mar- shal Hindenburg, President of the German Republic. They were the \"secret adviser\" (Geheimrat) Duisberg, head of the famous chemical firm I. G. Farben and one of the leaders of German big industry; and the royal chamberlain, Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, mouthpiece of the Junkers and official representative of the Reichs-Landbund, the Junker agricul- tural organization. They came to present to Hindenburg a \"gift from the German econom y\"—title to the Neudeck estate, castle and grounds. Neudeck had belonged to th e Hindenburgs from the time of Frederick the Great, though the Marshal himself had never owned landed property. Tomorro w the whole country would be celebrating his eightieth birt hday and on this occasion the Junkers and big industry had deci ded to restore the estate of his ancestors to him. A Stroke of Genius The idea had been conceived by the designing Oldenburg- Januschau, who was a close friend of Hindenburg. This \"king's chamberlain\" was a kind of liaison officer to the Mar- shal, permanently delegated by the junker organization to safeguard their interests in the Presidential office. Oldenburg had worked effectively. The contribution of the Junkers to the cost of the gift was trifling. The greater part of the funds came from big manufacturers, whose purse-strings were 154"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 155 looser than those of the Prussian landlords, always in debt. Nevertheless the moral benefit of this princely gift to the Marshal-President would revert equally to both groups. In this there was a certain justice: the industrialists had supplied the money, the junkers the idea. Industrialists and Junkers were hoping by this gesture to obtain a stronger hold on Hindenburg. But the junkers hoped to secure an additional advant age of their own. By being transformed from an army officer without property into a landowner, Hindenburg would become a genuine Junker like his forebears. He would have the same day-to-day economic anxieties as they, and would be better qualified to understand their ideas and aspirations. Bismarck himself had been a great landlord, owner of three domains: Schoenhausen, Friedrichs ruh, and Varzin. His entire economic policy conformed to th e special interests of the junkers. Under his regime import duties on agricultural prod- ucts were steadily increased, to the disadvantage of other classes of the population. Under his successor, however, things had gone less smoothly. A Junker Who Forgot to Be a Junker When the young and impetuous William II decided that Bismarck should retire, he replaced him by Count von Cap- rivi, a general, member of a Junker family, who at first had the confidence of Prusso-Teutonic groups. But Caprivi pos- sessed no fortune of his own; he was simply a soldier. More- over, he pursued economic polic ies directly opposed to what the Junkers believed to be th eir interest. Between 1892 and 1894 he concluded commercial tr eaties which represented evolution toward free trade w ith Austria-Hungary, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Roumania, Serbia, and Russia. They provided for a decrease in duties on imported agricultural products, in exchange for simila r concessions granted by the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"156 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY various countries for admitting manufactured goods which Germany wished to export. Young German industry was happy, and the public gladly experienced a general reduction in the cost of living. But the Junkers were furious. Because of their unprogressive methods of exploiting their soil they could make profits only if they could sell their products at exor bitant prices, artificially bol- stered by high import duties. So they decided on the fall of von Caprivi who had become in creasingly persona non grata to them. A campaign of unusual violence was launched against the chancellor. Finally in October, 1894, the Emperor, while visiting on the estate of Count von Eulenberg, one of the most influential Junkers of th e time, decided without appar- ent reason to recall Caprivi. The \"powers behind the throne\" had received full satisfaction. Hindenburg became President of the German Republic in 1925. Descendant of an old J unker family, he was elected with the support of the Junker class, but once in power he seemed at times to forget that his sole duty in his new office was to serve the special interest s of some 13,000 Prussian lords. True it was that Hindenburg, like Caprivi, owned no land. His fidelity to Junker principles , therefore, originated simply in the traditional alliance between the corps of Prussian offi- cers and the Junker class, and not in any direct personal interest. For an officer younger than Hindenburg, the en- tangled interests of the Reichswehr and Junker organizations might have been an argument strong enough to warrant total submission to orders from the manor lords. But Hindenburg was a hero of the Great War as well as President of the Republic, elected for a term of seven years at the age of 78- He could therefore consider himself sufficiently independent to act merely as one who wished to leave posterity the recol- lection of a man devoted to the public interest. At the beginning of his term as President, Hindenburg"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 157 seemed unwilling to accept orders from anyone, and, in spite of his antecedents, was ready to serve the Republic faith- fully. The Republican parties we re agreeably surprised, but this independence was unbearable to the Junker class. It had to be stopped at all costs. Neudeck was the bait held out to him. By one operation Hindenburg was made a debtor of the Junker class and heavy industry. In addition to this, as owner of a great estate in East Prussi a he was henceforth to have the same worries and interests as other Junkers. The case of Caprivi had been a lesson, and the remedy found was an excel- lent one. A Fruitful Alliance The alliance between Junkers and big industry in this over- ture to Hindenburg was not an innovation. It was the same fruitful cooperation which we have seen at work behind the Fehme murders. At first glance the interests of the two eco- nomic classes do not appear id entical. The Junkers favored high tariffs on agricultural produc ts to prevent competition, while it was to the advantage of industrialists to conclude commercial treaties facilitating exportation and allowing in exchange importation of agricu ltural products. In signing his series of commercial treaties Caprivi had yielded to considera- tions of the latter sort. But German industrialists of 1927 were no longer like those of 1891. The latter saw their future in natural expansion of their export markets, in healthy competition with manufac- turers of other countries. Th e industrialists of 1927 had already been brought into line by the Junkers, They had been made to understand that as German manufacturers they need not think along the lines of Anglo-Saxon economy. In free competition with foreign industries they could hope at best to secure one of the three firs t ranks in world markets. But Germany, according to Prusso-Teutonic schemes, should not"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY be content with one of the first places, but ought to obtain complete domination of all markets. The plan for achieving this purpose was simple. Instead of facilitating trade with other parts of the world by concluding commercial treaties which successively lowered tariffs, they must, on the contrary, increas e duties on imports and set themselves apart from the rest of the world. (Later this isola- tion was to be effected much more thoroughly with the aid of exchange control introduced under Bruening's regime by Dr. Luther and perfected under Hitler by Dr. Schacht: con- trol of exchange which subjects all importing to the control of the State.) The plan anticipated the following stages: eco- nomic isolation; considerable rise in cost of living; misery and discontent of the people; blame traced back to parliamentary institutions and the Allied nations; then a twofold result: discredit of parliamentary institutions and rearmament. At this point industrialists we re promised these advantages: huge arms orders as an ampl e compensation for lost export business; high tariffs on imported products of heavy industry; successive subsidies by the State to German industry to allow a certain amount of exporting as a method of dumping (in exchange the State obtained foreign currencies which it needed even with control of exchange); and finally, because of discontent of the people a nd as a result of rearmament, war; then conquest by blood and fire of new territories, each becoming an economic outlet tota lly submissive to German control. The Right Kind of Competition In this line of reasoning the point of view of the Hanseatic League no longer prevailed. That ancient trading association of free German cities had struggled to gain control of world markets by every legitimate means of free commerce. The Hansa's contests with English merchants had been sharp but"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 159 honorable for centuries, and had been carried on according to rules identical on both sides. Th e League, if its traditions had prevailed in the economic life of Germany, might indeed have become a real threat to other countries in the markets of the world, because German mercha nts were ingenious and indus- trious. But that threat would have been perfectly legitimate, conforming to the rules of the game of economic competition, and would have stimulated th e competitors of the Hansa merely to show greater ingenuity in their turn. The new economic plan had been conceived in order to produce a threat to Germany's competitors of an entirely different sort. It was no longer a matter of playing the game fairly to win as much as one could from one's opponent, but of overpowering him and taking everything away from him. The Junkers had succeeded in getting German industrialists to accept their robber-barons' ra ctics and discard traditional Hanseatic methods from the German economic scheme. There is a time-honored conflict between the two prin- ciples. In the middle of the fifteenth century the bloody war of the German Hanseatic cities against the Order had had its origin in the same conflict. In 1466 the Hanseatic cities had been victorious over the Teutoni c Knights. In the twentieth century the descendants of thos e Knights, the Junker class, succeeded in driving the Hanseatic economic concept out of Germany. World Dominion or Ruin The Junkers were anxious to have a good presentation for their \"new economic theories.\" Prusso-Teutonic theorists of the nineteenth century had supplied the necessary presenta- tion and at the same time an exact outline for applying their plan. (We have seen the advantage they managed to derive from the economic theories of List, put into practice by Dr. Schacht.)"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY But if that \"presentation\" had been useful in getting their plan accepted by the rest of Germany, including the indus- trialists, the Junkers were con cerned with something simpler: their own immediate interests. These immediate interests demanded higher tariffs on the import of agricultural prod- ucts to allow them to raise their prices and make greater profits. Their concern was to perpetuate the comfort in which they had lived as long as they were able to profit by the virtual famine that reigned in Germany during the post- war years. Here is what a German writer, Rudolf Olden (Hindenburg, Paris, 1935) says on the subject: \"The famine which continued in greater and lesser degree until 1924 had been the big opportunity for German agricul- ture, a period of easy success and luxury for everybody who produced comestibles. Hardly had this time passed when the great landowners immediately as ked for protective tariffs. On this point also Germany stood at the crossroads. On the one side fulfillment of the Treaty of Versailles, peace, disarma- ment, flourishing of commerce and industry, cultural prog- ress, satisfied labor; on the othe r side, high tariffs for grain and wine, isolation from the wo rld market, refusal to make reparations payments, rearmame nt, class struggle from above, provocation of a war of revenge.\" One may clearly discern the precise plan of Prusso-Teutonic organizations, the secret Junker societies, behind the \"uni- linear operations\" of the Great Elector, of Frederick the Great, of Bismarck, of William the Second and of those who, under the Weimar Republic, condu cted the Fehme and pre- pared in secret for rearmament. The extraordinary homoge- neity of these operations would of itself suffice as indication of their common origin. But one need not imagine that 13,000 Prussian manorial lords—i.e., a ll the Junkers—had been ini- tiated into the full scope of the plan. That is not the way secret societies work. The Junker class as a whole, assembled in the \"professional"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 161 organization\" known as the Reichs-Landbund, and in the social and political society known as the Herrenklub, envis- aged only their immediate interests. But those interests had been presented to them in such a way that they coincided with the combination of goals pursued. The procedure was simple enough. The junkers wished to isolate themselves from the rest of the world in the matter of importing prod- ucts of the soil, in order to sell their own at higher prices. To attain their purpose, they needed the political support of heavy industry; and to obtain that support they had to make promises to industry as to the rearmament program. More- over, they had to introduce into every German economic circle a complete plan that would encompass the realization of their own immediate ends. This complete plan lay ready for use. It was an elabora- tion of the precise plan that had directed every phase of Prussian growth, the plan which had inspired the fantastic dreams of the Prusso-Teutonic writers of the nineteenth cen- tury and the early twentieth. This plan evidently satisfied the imagination of the Junker cla ss as a whole, but to them it was fundamentally only a fort unate way of presenting their most immediate and much more limited purposes. The Junk- ers had to make every influential group in Germany accept the idea that for their country it was a matter of life or death to embark on a course of world conquest. The the- ory, \"world dominion or ruin,\" came anew to the surface, and they attempted to make peopl e believe that the fate of all Germany was at stake in this breath-taking dilemma. Actually if anyone was threatened with ruin it would be only the 13,000 Junkers—ruin which the Junkers could have avoided by other means: by moderniz ing their farm operations and restricting expenditures. But such modernization and restric- tions were inconceivable to thes e feudal lords. To avoid them all Germany had to be drawn into an interminable period of \"cannon versus butter,\" and strife with the rest of the world."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"162 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The \"Osthilfe\" Scandal The \"gift from the German economy\" given Hindenburg in 1927 in the form of the domain of Neudeck was to provide the Junker class with a hold over the octogenarian Hindenburg profitable in many respects. Several irregularities came about in connection with the gift. First of all, it was arranged to save on the transfer taxes. Taxes on gifts as valuable as Neudeck were extremely high, amounting to 44 per cent of the assessed value. The revenue authorities allowed themselves to be per- suaded to make an exception and formally waive these Taxes on the ground that Neudeck was a kind of \"national gift.\" This exemption could have been vaguely justified if it had actually been a matter of transferring property to the name of the Marshal-President. However, the deed to the property was not recorded in the name of Marshal Paul von Hinden- burg but in that of his son and aide-de-camp, Colonel Oscar von Hindenburg. Indubitably it was a matter of avoiding the inheritance tax in the eventuality, probably close, of the aged Marshal's death. Neudeck was worth a million marks; the inheritance taxes saved in additi on to the gift taxes mentioned above amounted to 100,000 marks. Incidentally, by register- ing the property in Colonel Hindenburg's name the Marshal's other children were deprived of their rights. The Marshal, entirely under his son's influence, offered no resistance. He did not realize that each of these irregularities opened a door through which pressure could later be brought to bear on him. Henceforth he could no longer allow himself the luxury of being a President caring only about the national interest. If he had ever dreamed (ingenuous thought!) of being able to free himself of his antecedents, and of acting simply as a soldier and German statesman, not as a Junker, he must now dispel that dream. He sank to the level of the other Junkers. He became their partner of destiny in a \"com- bine,\" disclosure of which might well embarrass him because"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 163 of his position much more than it could embarrass the insti- gators of the transaction. Oscar von Hindenburg had a fatal influence on his father. Eager to take advantage of his exceptional position, he was part of every political combination between 1915 and 1933. It was an open secret in Berlin that one could easily get what one wanted from the Marshal by being on good terms with the Colonel. Member of the Herrenklub, the \"social front\" of the Junker class, where deta ils of political deals were de- bated day in and day out, Oscar in the end was completely dominated by the Prusso-Teutonics. On his eightieth birthday th e Marshal, now a landowner, was exultant. He was enjoying Neudeck as a child enjoys a new toy. His dream at last had come true. He would no longer be a poor officer without soil or root. This was what had troubled him so during his youth when he used to com- pare himself with his more fortunate army comrades. If he wished to relax from his wearying duties he could now rest in his own castle, hunt on his own grounds; and when he died he could leave this lovely estate to his son. The latter would have the advantage of it at an age when the father had had to be content with being a poor guest on the property of friends. At Neudeck Hindenburg was the neighbor of Oldenburg- Januschau. The two saw more and more of each other and the Marshal had an even more attentive ear than before for the suggestions of the man whom he considered his benefactor. Oldenburg in his conversations em phasized the \"difficulties of agriculture.\" Indeed, the golden age which had reigned for the Junker class, due to the famine in Germany, had come to an end. The Junkers could no longer sell their products at exor- bitant prices and profit by the misery of others. Their yields on the agricultural market at current prices were no longer enough to allow them to continue the extravagant living and drunken carousing to which they were accustomed."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY A good share of Junker money was also going to finance illegal detachments of the Black Reichswehr concealed on their properties. All this was no longer possible with the reduced finances which the Prussian lords now had at their disposal. Besides, they were r unning further and further into debt. Hindenburg, who was touched by Oldenburg's recital of the \"misfortunes of agriculture,\" consented to intervene with the government to find a possible remedy. This was how the famous Osthilfe (Eastern Aid) was created, a fund amounting to 250 million marks. The avowed purpose of the Osthilfe was to \"come to the aid of small farmers and peasants who had been ruined in the period of inflation.\" But in the few years of its existence Osthilfe money brought about the \"refinancing\" of some 10,500 big Junker manor lords (of the entire 13,000), by payment of their debts and by according them new credits on practically unlimited terms. On the other hand, Rudolf Olden shows that of two million average farmers, only one out of forty-five received loans, and of three million small farmers in Germany, not one obt ained a thing. Accordingly, tremendous bitterness arose am ong the peasant class on the subject of the Osthilfe. Von Oldenburg-Januschau himself received over 600,000 marks from the Osthilfe. When certain people hinted later that he had gotten so much because of his initiative in the matter of the Neudeck gift, othe rs pointed out that when a person bears the name von Olde nburg-Januschau he needs no further argument to get a heavy slice of the cake. The distribution of funds was in the hands of Junker offi- cials. Investment of the money was carried out by a so-called \"guarantee procedure\" (Siche rungsverfahren) directed by trustees appointed for this pur pose. All the trustees were Junkers who in their turn were profiting by the refinancing of their own properties. Thus neighbors superintended each other, and made mutual grants of large sums."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 165 One of the duties of the trustees was supposed to be to verify that the money granted under the title \"debt repay- ment\" actually went to creditors. However, creditors found themselves generally deprived of the greater part of their equity, with very small hope of ever seeing their money. Some big Junker landowners were refinanced as many as four times, each time declaring their estates bankrupt in order to rid themselves of all indebtedness. Frequently this did not prevent their having money on the side, invested in pros- perous businesses. Others conti nued their reckless spending in accordance with the old junker custom. When refinancing was no longer possible in their own names they transferred their estates to the names of members of their families, fre- quently minors, and the same ga me went on ad infinitum. The development of semi-military organizations gained new intensity with the aid of this manna from Heaven distributed by the Osthilfe. A deputy speaking of these abuses before the Prussian Parliament said: \"The concealment and feedi ng of SA groups, of Stahl- helm troops and similar organizat ions, showy festivities on the occasion of Nazi and Deutsch-national electoral successes, excessive personal expenditures and other similar things could continue on a wide scale ever ywhere because of the good offices of the 'guarantee procedure.'\" Throughout Germany people bega n to whisper at first, then to talk more openly of the \"Osthilfe scandal.\" The names of Hindenburg and his son were fr equently mentioned in this connection, and it was said that being on friendly terms with the Colonel was sufficient to obtain ample sums from the Osthilfe. Olden, Hindenburg's biographer, says: \"A great number of Hindenburg's neighbors or people from the same social group as he—friends, or friends of friends—directly contacted the Pr esident or his son.

Friend- ships and cliques looked for and found their way into the Palace of the President of the Reich. Junkers managed to be recommended to the source whence the flow came. The land- lords from east of the Elbe [i.e ., the Junkers] had always—at all periods of their history—be en insatiable. They hurled themselves gluttonously upon the overflowing abundance.\" The Osthilfe scandal, and la ter that of Neudeck, hovered in the background of the history of the governments preced- ing the Hitler regime. The Catholic Centrum party and the Socialists stirred up the scandal, cautiously at first, then with more courage. This created great uneasiness among the Junker class. But even the Nazis, directly or i ndirectly, made revelations concerning these matters in order to keep atten- tion focused on them. It was because of the continual pres- sure thus exerted on the J unker class and Hindenburg that the Nazis were finally able to seize power and maintain their position with Junker support. A Paralyzed Parliament From March, 1930, until May, 1932, Dr. Heinrich Bruening was Chancellor of the Reich. He came from the movement of Christian labor syndicates, was a devout Catholic and mem- ber of the Centrum party. In principle he was opposed to the Junker class, as was his party. Actually, he could stay in power only so long as he tolerated their abuses and resigned himself to act, in spite of his better feelings, in accordance with Junker schemes. He had to yield office as soon as he tried to prove himself independent of them. When Bruening took office the democratic parties of Ger- many had already lost all initiative. The Fehme, faithful tool of the Prusso-Teutonic class, had suppressed the most enter- prising democratic leaders and intimidated the rest. This had"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 167 brought about sterility in parlia ment. The democratic parties, dispossessed and without true leaders, could do no construc- tive work, opposed as they were by an extremely active and Machiavellian Nazi minority. Th is was all the Junkers could ask. They had succeeded in suppressing their most dangerous opponents. If parliament (which they detested, though they had been forced to tolerate it from Bismarck's time on) now wound up by making a fool of it self and becoming paralyzed, nothing could give them greater delight. Bruening, not knowing how to govern with an impotent Reichstag, resigned himself to using an expedient which he was able to devise in accordance with provisions of the Weimar constitution. He decide d to introduce a system of decree-laws, i.e., decrees which had the force of law and depended merely on the signature of the President of the Republic. True, he was obliged to submit these decree-laws later for approval of the Reichs tag, but if this approval should be refused he could immediat ely dismiss the Reichstag by using a decree of dissolution signed in advance by the Presi- dent. Comparative parliamentary stability lasted, therefore, only under permanent threat of such dissolution. President Hindenburg thus became the source of all power. He had already become accustom ed to giving orders to poli- ticians who had access to him, treating the Chancellor and members of the government the way a commander-in-chief treats his staff officers in time of war. So great was the respect which this military chief inspired in the Germans that no one found anything amiss. From now on his power became still more absolute. But Hindenburg in turn was under the influence of the Junkers , especially since the deed of gift to Neudeck. Oscar von Hindenburg received daily orders from the Reichs-Landbund and the Herrenklub and continually whispered them to his father. So the Junkers' meddling with the government became quite direct."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"168 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Bruening at first tolerated th e abuses of the Osthilfe. He had, moreover, a still greater merit in the eyes of the Prusso- Teutonks, for it was he who, in July, 1931, introduced \"con- trol\" of the mark, which sepa rated the destiny of German currency and German economy from the rest of the world. A Financial Wizard Enters the Game Before 1923 the mark had passed through a period of acute inflation due to the effects of defeat. In 1924 Dr. Schacht replaced the German unit of currency, almost completely devaluated, by the \"Reichsmark,\" based on gold. The Reichs- mark circulated freely and became a choice international coin. Dr. Schacht had succeeded in making the world believe that henceforth Germany had decided to participate in inter- national exchange and become an integral part of world com- merce based on gold and free competition. The world's greatest financial institutions then offered Germany credit and her empty coffers were quickly filled. But the Prusso- Teutonics had not given up the plans of List. They figured that they could derive no advantage from the prosperity which Germany would achieve as a result of intensified inter- national trade. The good fortune to which they aspired was of an entirely different sort. For them it was essential to become isolated from the rest of the world and avail themselves of the sufferings and prejudices excited by that isolation to get the country started on the path to con- quest. In recalling to mind the theories of List we have already briefly indicated the role played in their execution by Dr. Schacht. The remarkable rise of Schacht is worth considering. Hjalmar Schacht was born in 1877. His father had returned to Germany from America only the year before Hjalmar's birth. The Schachts were a family from the frontiers of Schleswig-Holstein and Denmar k, who had, after annexation"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL l69 of Schleswig-Holstein by Bismarck, received German citizen- ship. But the Schachts had a leaning toward Denmark, and the occupation of their country by the Prussians was, for several members of the family, a reason for emigrating to America. Hjalmar's father was one of these. In the United States he acquired American citizenship and steeped himself in American democratic ideas. But reverses forced him to come back to Europe, and in 1876 he accepted a position as accountant in Germany. For th is reason his son was born on German soil. He named him Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht —Hjalmar to recall his Danish origin and Horace Greeley to show his admiration for the great American journalist and for American ideals in general. We have seen that List, creator of the economic doctrines of the Prussian school, had been an American citizen. It is a curious fact that Schacht, w ho was primarily responsible for putting these ideas into practice in modern times, was also of American background. Th is background unfortunately tended to inspire confidence in Dr. Schacht among Ameri- can and English bankers, and made easy the successful and conspicuous part he was to play in Anglo-Saxon financial circles. Schacht started his career as a financial journalist. He was next employed as financial expert in one of the largest Ger- man banks, the Dresdner Bank. During World War I he was assigned to the army to help organize the economic occupa- tion of Belgium. After two years he was recalled to Germany, because he had been accused of having used his official author- ity to the advantage of his own bank in transactions involving occupation currency. In the cour se of his career he was fre- quenriy taunted about this \"Belgi an affair\" by political adver- saries. After the war we find Schacht at the Darmstaedter Bank, another of the three largest German banks. Jacob Gold- schmidt, head of the Darmstaedter—who was at that time in"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"170 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY the vanguard of the speculation brought about by the wild inflation of the mark—had re cognized in Schacht a pliant and subservient henchman. Goldschmidt was the man responsible for the rise of Schacht, for it was on his advice that the German government put Schacht in charge of the Re ichsbank. His mission there was to bring to an end that astronom ical inflation, after it had impoverished the entire middle class of Germany, to the en- richment of a few big speculators. The stabilization of the mark was accomplished by Octo- ber 11, 1924. Dr. Schacht received all the credit for the work, although various experts had pave d the way. In any case, he did have the knack of creating in Germany and abroad the psychological atmosphe re necessary for a successful stabiliza- tion. He effectively spread the belief throughout the world that the mark was now definitely on a gold basis and that Ger- many in the future would honorably participate in world exchange based on free trade. No one doubted that these intentions were sincere, for they felt that Germany had everything to gain by taking such a course. Indeed, they thought that by playing the game of free competition, German industrialists and merchants, whose abilities were unquestionably firs t-class, would have every chance of securing a high plac e on the world's economic roll. A Most Unorthodox Financial Plan Reasoning thus, international fina ncial experts failed to rec- ognize one thing: that in the administration of Germany's affairs under the direction of the Prussian clique, what one might call \"the German national interest\" had but small influ- ence. It was the special interest alone of a restricted group, directing the affairs of Germany from behind the scenes, which decided what course was to be taken. Or rather, what that group, because of its \"robber baron\" spirit believed to be"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 171 irs interest. For that group, the job in mind had to be done in several stages. This was accomplished as follows: 1. The purpose of the first period, inflation, was to permit the looting of the entire German middle class. This was ac- complished to the advantage of the Junker class which was able to make money by the trem endous rise in prices, due to scarcity of agricultural products;* and also to the advantage of bankers and big industrialists speculating directly on infla- tion, like Stinnes, Thyssen, and Krupp. These men succeeded, during this period, in buying up tremendous quantities of in- dustrial properties with borrowed money which they were able to repay easily after the currency was devaluated. 2. After October 11, 1924, the next step was to encourage the inflow of foreign money under the guise of long and short term credits. Without these fre sh funds there would indeed have been nothing left to pi ck from German pockets. The small German merchants and manuf acturers had lost all their reserves during inflation. It was therefore essential, above all, to inspire confidence throughout the world regarding the mark, so that foreign credits would begin flowing in heavily. Sums amounting to from twenty to thirty billion marks were thus lent to German business in the period between 1925 and 1930. 3. During the years 1929-1930 the direction of this opera- tion was reversed. There was more and more talk of the heavy burdens borne by Germany after payment of repara- tions. In reality, these paymen ts amounted to scarcely ten billion marks. The peace treaty did not, on the country's balance sheet, represent much of a burden, because of the re-entry of gold as foreign inve stment worth twenty to thirty billions during the same period. German financial and governme ntal circles, painting the * When inflation reached astronomical proportions and this advantage of the Junkers became illusory, they then agreed that stabilization should take place at once."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"172 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY country's situation in darker and darker colors, artificially created a panic. This produced, in German and foreign finan- cial circles, a \"flight from the mark.\" From the middle of 1930 to July 1931, about two or three billion marks poured out of Germany. Finally, on July 13, 1931, under Bruening's administra tion, the financial authori- ties of Germany took advantage of the climax of the panic they themselves had provoked, to have the government de- clare a moratorium on internal and external debt payments, and they instituted \"control of exchange\" on a permanent basis. This control of exchange again took Germany off the gold standard. Its first result was to make impossible repayment of credits which had been accorded to German economy. All short term credits became automatically long term ones, or rather, credits of \"indefinite term,\" i.e., frozen credits. The same performance which allowed the spoliation of the whole German middle class during the period before 1924 now took place at the expense of financ ial interests the world over. 4. The introduction of control of exchange on July 13, 1931, represented complete se izure by the State—and by groups hiding behind the State—of all export and import busi- ness. All foreign currencies accruing from export must now be yielded to the State. All importing not deemed useful to the interests of the State was forbidden. Officials whose deci- sions were not subject to parl iamentary control ran every- thing, and behind them was still the same influential crowd. Import of products useful to the public at large was con- siderably slowed up, with pref erence given to entry of raw materials needed for making armaments. Heavy industry grew increas ingly prosperous. Private business suffered and prices of commodities doubled. Misery sprang up again among the middle and poorer classes of the population. The \"masters of Ge rmany\" were satisfied with the execution of their plan. Misery and discontent of the peo-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 173 pie were excellent arguments fo r ultimately compromising the parliamentary system which they so hated. In addition, the same arguments were invoked to excite the German peo- ple against France and England. This promoted psychologi- cal conditions favorable for the rearmament program, and prepared the way for the foreign conquest long anticipated by the Prusso-Teutonics. 5. Properly speaking, conquest—and the attempt at eco- nomic domination of world ma rkets which it implies—may be considered the fifth phase of the same program. Dr. Schacht Prepares the Panic Following the stabilization of the mark, Dr. Schacht was responsible, either directly or by his action behind the scenes, for the execution of the entire financial scheme described. When, in 1924, he had brought about stabilization he was acting in full accord with the Prusso-Teutonic class and the financial circles of Germany. The tactics corresponded per- fectly with what they wished. Only the Nazis, with their customary violence, criticized the stabilization. At that time their interests were not yet identical with those of the Prusso-Teutonics. They acted as free-lances, sitting in many anterooms. They did have some connections with the Prussian clique, but had not yet placed themselves totally at their service. The aim they pursued above all else was to capitalize on the discontent of the people to raise themselves, by demagogic means, to power. Therefore they were fierce opponents of a measure such as stabilization which might eliminate one of th e main causes of discontent. The advantages which Prusso-Teutonic circles hoped to gain —foreign loans destined to fill the empty cash boxes—did not interest them at all, for they had nothing to gain thereby. On June 22, 1925, the Nazi or gan Voelkischer Kurier at- tacked Dr. Schacht and called stabilization \"the greatest"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"174 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY swindle ever committed at the public's expense.\" Other Nazi newspapers said that Schacht wa s of Jewish origin and that his real name was \"Hajim Schachtl.\" Alfred Rosenberg cook up this attack on Schacht in a work published in 1926 under the title \"Novemberkoepfe.\" Th ese attacks did not bother Schacht much, for at that time the Nazis were not very- powerful and he knew that he was under the protection of a much more influential group. During the period after the inflation Schacht tried to in- spire the world with confidence in Germany. In his frequent talks with directors of other government banks he showed himself to be a conservative, cau tious financier. At that period he conformed in every detail to the classic ideal of a great banker who could personally gua rantee to the world the healthy condition of Germany's fina ncial affairs, as well as the sound basis of world-wide investments in the mark. In 1929, when the coffers we re almost filled, Schacht became bolder. Phase number two could give way to phase number three. On April 16, 1929, one of the regular conven- tions of national bank heads of various countries was held at the Hotel George V in Paris. As usual, the conference was to discuss the question of reparations, examining different financial aspects of the prob lem. Suddenly Dr. Schacht took the floor and began, to the surp rise of his colleagues, intro- ducing political factors into the discussion. He stated that Germany could not continue to make reparations payments unless she received in exchange the Polish corridor of Danzig, Upper Silesia, and \"a colonization spot somewhere in the world.\" Such talk surprised and shocked Dr. Schacht's colleagues utterly. What—this conserva tive financier who had made them believe all along that Germany was on the road to finan- cial recovery, and who had during previous conferences ar- gued only about financial difficu lties of a technical nature- was he suddenly subordinating the financial relationship"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 175 between his country and the rest of the world to political demands? The international bankers were quite familiar with these demands. They had been the favorite theme of a small group of German nationalists, including the Nazis. But in the past bankers had been made to belie ve that these groups had no influence, that the German Republic sincerely intended to respect its obligations, and that Dr. Schacht especially, as high master of German finance, cared only about stabilization of the international financial situation and the development of thriving trade. But now didn't it look as if he were borrowing the arguments of his country's extremists? Et tu mi fili Brute? The disappointment of the fina nciers was great. Moreau, Governor of the Bank of France, demanded that the confer- ence be immediately closed. Finally it was agreed to diminish the shock by inviting Dr. Schacht to submit a written report. Political matters were not discussed further during the sessions following, and the bankers left the conference with a sem- blance of agreement on financial questions. But the warning had been a fierce one and had made its impression. Dr. Schacht now speeded up the steps to follow. Phase number three of the program was ending. In frequent inter- views with his great friend, Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, Schacht brought out more and more plainly the internal difficulties of Germany. It was no longer a matter of inspiring confidence in the world, but of slowly and methodically preparing th e way for panic which would sometime soon justify suspension of reparations payments and the freezing of foreign loans. Late in February, 1930, Owen Young received a cable from Schacht informing him of his intended resignation. Young felt it proper to forward this cable to the German Embassy in Washington. That was how Germany and the world at large learned the surprising news."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"176 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The roundabout way Schacht chose for revealing his inten- tions is astonishing. Nevertheless, it was in line with Schacht's purpose. This direct communication to the American delegate was expected to disclose the disagreement supposedly existing between Schacht and the leaders of Germany. Thus he gave the world clearly to understand that he could no longer per- sonally guarantee the stability of Germany's financial situa- tion—which was the best means of hastening panic. Besides, by communicating directly with the American financial ex- pert Schacht hoped to preserve for himself the sympathies of American bankers (those of London were already insured by reason of his friendship w ith Montagu Norman. Further- more, it is not known whethe r he simultaneously sent a similar message to Norman which the latter had not felt obliged to divulge.) The impression Schacht gave was as if he had said, \"I have done my best, prepare for the worst. After me, the deluge.\" On March 7, 1930, Schacht's resignation became official. The painful surgical intervention which had been planned as the end of phase three of the program—panic, moratorium and exchange control—approached . By retiring to private life in time, Schacht avoided all blame for the operation, in Ger- many as well as abroad. He knew that he could always come back later, washing his hands like Pontius Pilate. All this appears clear today in the light of subsequent events. At the time, everyone found the reasons for Schacht's departure somewhat mysterious. Writing on March 9, 1930, in the Vossische Zeitung of Be rlin, the great publicist, Gcorg Bernhard, said: \"No one knows the real reason for this resig- nation.\" Today we know it only too well. The departure of Schacht contributed greatly to the Ger- man capitalists' \"flight from the mark.\" Large sums of money were invested abroad. Dr. Hans Luther, named by Bruening to replace Schacht at the head of the Reichsbank, did little to repair the damage. The die was cast and it was now simply"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 177 a matter of regulating the rhythm and speed of the program. Finally, taking advantage of a heavy run on private banks, among which the Darmstaedter Bank (the bank Schacht came from) was the first, Bruening's government, on July 13, 1931, decreed a bank moratorium and \"control of exchange\" which was to become permanent. Phase three of the program was finished and Germany now beca me financially isolated from the world. The Plight of \"Poor Germany\" The operation had so far been successful and the plan approached phase four without a hitch because nearly all the international financial interests had allowed themselves to be taken in by the touching \"plight\" of \"poor Germany.\" Never- theless, the Financial Chronicle of New York in its issue of July 18, 1931, revealed clear ly the German government's responsibility in this course of events. \"The flight from the Mark that resulted in the present situ- ation of Germany is due both to the demand for foreign cur- rencies by fearstricken Germans who recalled vividly their worthless holdings of German securities and currency eight years ago, and the withdrawals of their short term credits by foreign investors. The signal for the withdrawals was given, it must be remarked, by the German government itself. Chancellor Bruening and Foreign Minister Curtius advertised rather too well, during their visit to London in June, the pre- carious state of affairs produced in the Reich by the world- wide economic depression and th e heavy reparations burden. Pleas then made, together with the German government decree imposing heavier taxes, started a unanimous export of capital which finally exceeded the capacities of the financial institutions of the Reich.\" In these events Bruening's re sponsibility is indisputable, but how far it went is not clear. The former Chancellor of the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"178 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Reich, now living in the United St ates, has not seen fit, up to the present time, to give bis version of the story of his years in power. Possibly he was not fully conscious of the role he was made to play by the Pr usso-Teutonic clique, who re- mained masters of the situatio n under his regime also. But the extent of Bruening's personal re sponsibility is only relatively important. Certain it is that in tolerating, over a period of two years, the practices which prevailed in the distribution of Osthilfe funds, and in creating th e financial isolation of Ger- many, he did render conspic uous service to the Prusso- Teutonic class. Moreover, if it we re not for this weakness, or blindness, or temporary compliance—whatever one chooses to call it—Bruening could not have kept himself in power for two years. The Totalitarian Plan Between the two world wars, Germany was thus the first country to destroy, on a large scale, the effect of the stabiliza- tion of her currency, and to break away from international free trade based on gold. It was she, therefore, who supplied the \"evil inspiration,\" and with in a few months several coun- tries followed suit. The avalanche was let loose. Finally many countries adopted a kind of \"control of exchange\" which became, during the period before the war, the primary ob- stacle to international commerce.* The control of exchange introduced by Germany was extremely strict. A veritable financial \"wall of China\" was built around the country. Without this seclusion, whose rules were established and perfected under a regime still bearing the title \"Republic,\" Hitler's totalitarian scheme could not have functioned. The new measures were part of the Prusso- * The state of war added other obstacles such as transportation difficulties and prohibitions on exporti ng. In addition, during the war the few countries which were still allowing free export of currency finally adopted, almost without exception, a system of more or less strict control of exchange."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 179 Teutonics' plan, and they had definitely decided that, from that time on, the country was head ed in a totalitarian direc- tion. At that moment it was probabl y not yet clear in the minds of the real masters of German y who should be entrusted with the task of putting this totalitarian orientation into practice. Although Hitler was already a serious candidate for the enviable post of \"sublime henchman,\" and was the protege of several persons of influence, the forces running Germany from behind the scenes still, in principle, had free choice. One may well imagine that they might have put someone else in charge of the execution of an absolutely identical plan, pro- vided that they could have found one as well qualified as Hitler to dispatch the business. It was Hitler's good fortune that at the time no other man existed in Germany who had his peculiar qualifications to put into execution the Machiavel- lian plan of the Prusso-Teutonics. Von Papen, who was the only other serious candidate, was simply an amateur in com- parison. He did not have the qualities required of a \"good professional.\" The \"Robber Baron\" Concept After the advent of Nazism only the method of a \"finan- cial wall of China\" could permit German economy to be placed practically on a war basi s and to work for total na- tional rearmament. (Secret rearmament in accordance with a definite plan had never ceased since the Armistice.) It was this financial arrangement wh ich paved the way for Hitler's demagogic argument* that other nations were refusing Ger- many the raw materials she needed; and therefore she must conquer to get them. It was this argument that made it pos- sible for Hitler to get his people to accept the harsh policy, * If the Prusso-Teutonics had chosen another \"henchman\" he would have used the same argument."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"180 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY \"cannon instead of butter,\" and the sufferings of war. By vir- tue of the same argument he got people in certain foreign circles almost to excuse his policies because they bewailed the fate of \"starving Germany.\" We have already touched on this question, but one cannot insist too strongly on the fallacy of this line of reasoning. As long as she remained on the basis of a free financial system Germany could always have procured all the raw materials she needed. They were at her di sposal in free markets through- out the world, and could be bought in a few seconds at any time by means of a simple cabled order. Countries much smaller—Belgium, for example, which was as industrialized as Germany—were also in the same position and never com- plained of a \"dearth of raw materials\" or of \"lack of vital space.\" This dearth, this lack of vital space, was deliberately produced by a series of measures, the first of which was the introduction of control of exchange on July 13, 1931. Those who defend the German point of view try to prove that the financial panic provoked by the introduction of control of exchange was not brought about deliberately by the group ruling the affairs of Germany, and that consequently control of exchange was inevitable. The reverse is easy to prove, but even if we admit for a moment the correctness of this thesis, we must say that the solution by control of exchange as a permanent measure was the worst that could have been chosen. One may compare Germany in panic to a bank on which there is a run. Obviously, the doors must be closed for a time, but permanent closing, or opening subject to all sorts of restrictive and annoying rules imposed on patrons, would be the best way one could imagine to avoid entirely restoring normal life to the bank. One need not wonder why a bank choosing such methods goes to its ruin. The only solution by which one might hope to save a bank in straits would be to put persons in charge who inspire confidence, and start to function again by opening the cashiers' windows wide."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 181 Germany's seclusion from the normal economic world ex- change was also in perfect harmony with what one would expect from \"robber barons.\" He nceforth it was a matter of gaining possession of raw material s by force and consequently of the territories which produced them, even if it was possible to buy and pay for these materi als with the product of one's labor, provided, of course, that one was inclined to supply such labor. Most people—and mo st nations—feel that this procedure is simpler, healthie r and more satisfactory. The robber barons, and the powers governing Germany, felt (and still feel) exactly the opposite way. People committing acts consid ered dishonest under the law always try to excuse these acts by saying that they have been obliged to act so because the society in which we live does not allow them to live otherwise. Just the same attitude was adopted by Germany from 1931 on; Hitler merely accentu- ated it by developing the theme of \"vital space.\" But the plans providing for this attitude were established long before 1931 by the powers behind the German scene. Dr. Schacht Chooses Hitler In 1930, at the time of Schacht's resignation, the Prusso- Teutonic powers did not yet seem to have chosen Hitler as final executor of their schemes. The agitation which he had created in Germany had a certain utility for these aims; there- fore they helped him when occasion offered but had not yet decided to entrust him with the \"supreme task.\" If the combined Prusso-Teutonic powers had not yet made their choice, Schacht had made his. From 1930 on he was staking everything on Hitler. Known to the public as a man of democratic convictions, Schacht had in reality always been in close touch with the Prusso-Teutonics and in particular with the \"heavy industry\" wing of that group. He was no fool; he knew who wielded"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"182 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY the real power in Germany. All his activity as head of the Reichsbank, the stabilization of the mark and his fruitful efforts to attract foreign capital, had been undertaken in per- fect agreement with the Prusso-Teutonics. We have seen that at that time the Nazis were not in agree- ment with him, for they knew that stabilization and influx of foreign capital would bring order and prosperity back to the country. And nothing could have a less favorable effect on the success of their demagogic agitation than order and prosper- ity. No wonder, then, that they attacked Schacht's stabiliza- tion measures. Not yet admitted to the \"inner councils,\" Hitler and his friends did not know that stabilization and the prosperity it was designed to br ing about were to be of short duration, according to the intentions of the very ones who had decided on the introduction of these measures. Toward the end of his regime at the head of the Reichsbank Dr. Schacht contributed greatly to preparations for the panic which was to reach its climax in July, 1931, a year and four months after his return to private life. Attracting foreign capital no longer concerned the Prusso-Teutonics. Now they were occupied with achieving su ccessively fina ncial and eco- nomic autarchy in Germany and ultimately keeping the for- eign capital which had been invested there. This pleased the Nazis better, since panic and privation resulting from autarchy would furnish a fertile field for their agitation. The points of contact therefore between Hitler and Schacht were quite obvious. Meetings between Sch acht and Nazi leaders took place and after his departure from the Reichsbank Schacht saw Hitler personally. No Nazi again accused Schacht of being named Hajim Schachtl. During March, 1930, the National Socialist deputy Fede r was the only one to defend Schacht in the Reichstag while deputies of other parties at- tacked him for his \"unmotiv ated\" resignation which was bound to have a harmful effect upon Germany's financial prestige."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 183 Immediately after his retirement from office in 1930 Schacht procured subsidies for Hitler from his friends in heavy in- dustry. About that time Schach t introduced Dr. Walter Funk to Hitler. Funk was to become head of economic affairs in Germany under the Hitler regime. Schacht had known Funk when the latter was a young economic journalist working chiefly for publications financed by industrialists of the Ruhr. His presence close to Hitler represented a further guarantee to the industrialists th at their plans would be faithfully exe- cuted by Hitler. Schacht and Funk had long conversations with Hitler on matters concerning the economic future of Germany, and explained List's ideas to him. In this way Hit- ler's economic training was shaped in a direction coinciding in every particular with Prusso-Teutonic conceptions and tra- ditions. He understood the full meaning of List's economic thesis, which recommended rigi d economic isolation from the rest of the world in order to have to conquer it by force. All the speeches made by Funk from the time he began to repre- sent Germany in the economic s phere were obviously inspired by this thesis. In the fall of 1930 Schacht set out on a journey which took him through several countries: Denmark, Sweden, Switzer- land and America. He went \"as a private citizen\" to visit his friends in banking circles. He was well received everywhere, for the halo of the stabiliza tion still surrounded him. People did not realize that he was actua lly just as responsible for the recent deterioration of German finances which he had pro- moted from the wings. Schacht was still looked upon as a man of the Weimar Republic, a sincere democrat. Foreign bankers therefore wondered why during his trip he openly defended the Nazis and predicted a great future for them, using the Leitmotiv; \"They are not as dange rous to big business as peo- ple say.\" On his return to Germany the National Socialist deputy von Reventlow made a speech in the Reichstag thank- ing the former President of the Reichsbank for having"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"184 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY so well explained the Nazi point of view in the United States. In spite of the position taken openly by Schacht in favor of National Socialism, people were astonished when on March 17,1933, he returned as head of the Reichsbank. Hitler had taken office only six weeks previously, on January 30. The Fuehrer had decided to allow free rein in financial matters to the man who had considerably aided his accession to power by winning confidence toward him of a section of the Prusso- Teutonic group as well as of German and foreign banking circles. Bruening's Blunder Bruening was much less \"in the know\" than either Schacht or Hitler. In spite of services he had consciously or uncon- sciously rendered the Prusso-T eutonics, Bruening was sacri- ficed by them in 1932. Indeed the Chancellor, though he had been obedient in the beginning to pressures to which he had been exposed, was naive enough toward the end of his term in office not to recognize th e precise extent of influence exerted by the Prusso-Teutonics over the affairs of Germany. The misery of the peasant class had been aggravated as a con- sequence of the very measures which were enriching the Junkers. Bruening committed the ta ctical error of heeding his humanitarian feelings, a dange rous luxury for a German statesman. He had been moved by the peasants' misery, and to bring about a remedy had envi saged a plan of settling small farmers on land taken from poorly exploited large estates. This land would have to be conde mned at prices to be deter- mined. This Siedlungsplan, althoug h quite modest in extent, alarmed the Junkers exceedingly. They began to conduct a campaign against Bruening, speaking of his \"agrarian Bol-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 185 shevism.\" Bruening aggravated his mistake in the eyes of the Prusso-Teutonics by retorting with a dangerous argument. To justify his plan he hinted that he would let the Osthilfe abuses be brought up again and he threatened to prosecute the people responsible for th em. He ingenuously imagined that it would suffice to pronounce this threat in order to win the argument. Actually the argument was dynamite and caused an explosion. The stable Brue ning regime which had lasted more than two years disappeared in a trice. Representatives of the Landbund and the Herrenklub had worked on Colonel von Hindenburg and he interceded with his father, only a few weeks after the Marshal-President's re-election in which Bruening had helped considerably. The Marshal felt a certain gratitude toward his Chancellor and was embarrassed to have to sacrifice him. But what could he do when Bruening had committed the blunder of definitely dis- pleasing those Landbund gentlemen? And then had not Oscar remarked that if too much were said about the Osthilfe busi- ness, people would end up by w ondering similarly about the circumstances under which the de ed of gift to Neudeck had been made? Hindenburg called Bruening into his office and the inter- view ended with the latter's resignation. The Chancellor had been able to govern only with the aid of the famous \"decrees of dissolution\" of the Reichsta g, signed in advance by the President. Since the Marshal no longer accorded him his con- fidence and refused to sign th e necessary decrees from that time on, Bruening had to leave. Three men chiefly had contributed to Bruening's fall, three ambitious men who depended upon different sources of strength: von Papen, General Schleicher, and Hitler. They had thus succeeded in elimina ting one rival who had been in their way. The problem now was for each to eliminate the other two."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"186 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The Man of the Junkers Franz von Papen was the man of the Junkers, or at least, recognized their strength, intende d to serve them faithfully, and derive thereby well deserved advantages. He was not a Junker himself, in the strict se nse of the word, for he did not come from the eastern provinces. He was descended from a noble Westphalian family. His an cestors had participated in the terrible practices of the Fehme of Westphalia but were not part of the circle around the Teutonic Knights. Von Papen, a member of the Herre nklub, had nevertheless been accepted by the Junkers as one of them, and he conducted himself as a faithful executor of the Landbund's designs. Attache of the German Embass y at Washington until 1916, von Papen had been responsible for numerous acts of sabotage carried out to obstruct American manufacture of armaments. He later joined detachments of the German army in Turkey and after the war became active in politics. A de vout Catholic, he was at first a member of the Centrum party, the Catholic party par excellence. Then, ha ving realized that the real power was in the hands of the Junker class, he swerved fur- ther and further away from the Centrum, whose platform opposed the Junkers', and applied himself exclusively to the promotion of Prussian policies. By reason of his Westphalian origin von Papen had close connections with the big industrialists of the Ruhr. He ex- erted himself therefore to strengthen the bonds long existing between Junkers and heavy industry. Not ignoring the influ- ence which the Nazi movement appeared to be gaining in the wake of the Junker movement, he procured subsidies several times for Hitler from the industrialists. In these efforts he was later matched by Schacht. Each time, of course, he acted with the full approval of his master s, the Junkers. Finally recog- nizing the prestige surrounding Marshal von Hindenburg and taking account of the fact that as long as he was President of"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 187 the Republic he would wield gr eat authority, von Papen at- tached himself particularly to his person and acquired con- siderable influence over him. Von Papen's intrigues contributed greatly to Bruening's fall. Member of the Centrum party like Bruening, he should normally have formed a common fr ont with him. Actually he set a trap for him. After getting him to talk privately about his plans for dividing land into lots, he hurried to report these conversations to the Herrenkl ub and to Hindenburg. He gave them to understand that Brue ning was promoting a policy contrary to Junker interests and that it was necessary to get rid of him. The Man of the Reichswehr General Kurt von Schleicher wa s above all else a soldier and in his political attitude depe nded chiefly on the Reichswehr. He was also considered the more or less official delegate of the army in the political world. This was the role he intended faithfully to perform. He hid in the shadow of the different governments which succeeded each other—the ever alert watch-dog over the interests of that powerful organization, the Reichswehr. His mistake was to believe that the Reichs- wehr was a power in itself which could get along without every other power, including the Junker class. In spite of his Prussian origin Schleicher didn't like the idea that the Reichswehr had to receive orders from the Land- bund, but at the outset he did not show his displeasure. To strengthen his position he sought allies outside the Reichs- wehr. He believed he had found them in the persons of Gregor Strasser and Captain Roehm, two men who repre- sented, within the Nazi party, tendencies opposed to the Junkers. Schleicher figured that Roehm, who was at the head of the 600,000 men comprising the SA, and Gregor Strasser, who"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"188 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY came immediately after Hitler in the Nazi hierarchy, would be the real future masters of the Nazi movement. Gregor Strasser was the sincer e fanatic of the movement, a direct antithesis of the Mach iavellian Hitler. Strasser still believed in the program represented by the name \"National Socialist\" and took a very ce nsorious attitude toward the Prusso-Teutonics' hold on German y's affairs. Gregor Strasser was, moreover, strongly influe nced by his brother Otto on this subject. The latter, though clearly the more intelligent and discerning of the two brothers, did not have the prestige of Gregor because he was younger. Cognizant of Hitler's lack of sincerity and of his servile submission to the Prusso- Teutonic powers, Otto Strasser le ft the Nazi party in July, 1930. Gregor stayed because he imagined that with the great influence he wielded over the militant members of the party he would succeed in making his ideas triumph. Through Gregor Strasser, Schleicher hoped to secure the help of the Nazis and their parliamentary representatives who were very strong in the Reichstag. Roehm did not have the sincerity of Strasser. He was a simple adventurer, but, South German like Strasser, he disliked the strong influence of Prus- sian lords on German affairs. His cohorts of the SA struck terror everywhere. They were composed of hoodlums of every sort, including some elements from the Consul and Rossbach organizations. These had not been able to find other employment after dissolution of those organizations, and findi ng themselves abandoned by their former bosses, ended up by joining the first free gang willing to feed them. In spite of the presence of these elements on its roll, the SA, under Roehm's leadership, did not incline toward the Junkers. Roehm figured that the Nazi party would soon be the sole force of importance in Germany. Since he was at its core with his 600,000 SA men he would wield th e real power. Schleicher expected to use to advantage his identity of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 189 feeling with Strasser and Roehm on the subject of the Junk- ers. Certainly the Rcichswehr was, to his mind, the really supreme power in Germany. But if he were to oppose the Junkers, the Nazis, espe cially if they were of the complexion of Gregor Strasser and Roehm, would be welcome allies. Consequently as a se rvice to his newly acquired friends he violently opposed General Groene r, War Minister in Brue- ning's cabinet, when Groener decided to dissolve the semi- military organizations of the Nazis, including Roehm's SA. Groener usually acted as a man of politics rather than as a general. As for Schleicher, he knew that he could count on the full support of the Reichswehr even if there were conflict between himself and Groener. Moreover, the latter, who was not of noble birth, had always been considered by the other generals as an upstart plebeian. Schleicher now showed the generals clearly that the Nazis could be of great use to them and that the SA would end up by augmenting the Reichswehr troops. Their dissolution must be avoided at all costs. Schleicher and the Reichswehr were therefore in agreement with von Papen and the Junkers in the matter of getting rid of Bruening and Groener. This fa cilitated the abrupt dismissal of the Chancellor by Hindenburg, for the Marshal heeded the counsel of the Reichswehr. Von Papen and Hitler rubbed their hands. Thanks to the aid they had received from Schleicher, they had got rid of one of their rivals for power. Hitler Chooses His Masters Of the three people left in the poker game after Bruening was \"cleaned out,\" Hitler was by far the best tactician and at the same time the most hypocritical and Machiavellian. Ever since the beginning of his career he had had but one goal: personal power. To achieve it he was always ready to make any concession or any compromise. He also knew exactly for"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"190 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY whom to reserve these concessi ons and compromises, for he judged accurately the importance of powers opposing each other and figured that he should always ally himself with the strongest. Hitler knew that the democratic parties in Germany were completely paralyzed, at first as a consequence of acts of the Fehme, and later because of th e rise of his own party which had been effected with all the cunning of demagogism and terror. There remained the Prusso-Teutonic group which con- trolled Germany's affairs to a greater and greater extent. Hitler realized that he must reckon with several divergent forces within this group. The Junker organizations, with their \"professional\" off- shoot, the Landbund, and their \"s ocial\" outgrowth, the Her- renklub appeared to be the most powerful. The bulk of the Junker class were interested onl y in maintaining their feudal privileges, but the secret J unker organizations, descended from the Society of Lizards, seemed to have kept alive the most fantastic, most ambitious Prussian expa nsion schemes. The big industrialists of Westphalia ran second. They had by this time definitely chosen their path of industrial expan- sion: the rearmament of Ge rmany. Hugenberg, who con- trolled a powerful press and the \"Deutschnazional\" party in the Reichstag, was their agent. The industrialists felt inferior to the Junkers in the matter of secret organization. Their infiltration into the machinery of the State was not as com- plete as that of the Prussian lords. Nevertheless, they were superior in financial means. The third component of the Prusso-Teutonic group was the Reichswehr. Sprung from the same roots as the Junkers, joined to them by a thousand ties, and generously serving their interests, the Reichswehr still had an existence of its own, determined by its own professional ambition. Groener was an example of a general who had almost completely escaped the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 191 grasp of the external powers which controlled the Reichs- wehr. Schleicher, mouthpiece of the Reichswehr until 1933, at first had a meek attitude toward the Junkers, but later tried to save the army from their influence. These tendencies show that the army officers, proud of their professional knowledge, ha d at times an exaggerated opinion of the influence which their armed forces gave them in the internal political scheme, and did not always look favor- ably upon the role which the other elements of the Prusso- Teutonic group made them play. In spite of this fancied independence, the Reichswehr on. the whole was still an organic component of, and faithfully submissive to, the Prusso- Teutonic group. The officials sprung from the old Prussian school, descend- ants direct or spiritual of \"officials of the Order,\" did not form so coherent an entity as the Reichswehr, for example. They could be found scattered here and there throughout the machinery of administration. They could not be dis- tinguished, on the surface, from o fficials of another type of a more modern and more democratic background. By now they could also be met—and this had been true for some time —well beyond Prussian frontiers, in other parts of Germany. Prussian centralization had functioned well in Germany since Bismarck's times: Prussian officials were sent all around the country and local officials were brought closer and closer to the Prusso-Teutonic type of thinking through the influence of the numerous patriotic an d professional organizations under Prussian control. Not necessarily allied and related to the Junkers and officers, but sometimes merely coming from schools steeped in the old Prussian spirit, they were faithful servants, in most cases reaping the personal reward for their devotion. If they committed abuses, or closed their eyes to the abuses of others, this was always because of their devotion to what they thought—sometimes correctly, but often mis- takenly—a higher German cau se. Highly disc iplined them-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"192 THE THOUSAND-TEAR CONSPIRACY selves, and disciplining others—t herefore very intolerant—, highly conscious of what they called a \"Prussian sense of duty,\" they may well be consid ered chiefly the victims of their traditions. They were victims as well of the dark inten- tions of the rest of th e Prusso-Teutonic group. Characters of every backgr ound and description gravitated about the Prusso-Teutonic group, serving its interests and gaining advantages in exchange. Writers, university profes- sors, bankers, etc., in large num bers, had realized that they could count on the success of Prusso-Teutonic plans and became their ardent propagandists. But all these folk were not an organized entity. Hitler, who sought only personal power, was therefore not in the least obliged to reckon with them as factors in the internal politi- cal scheme. Furthermore, for th e same reasons he could also neglect the functionaries, in sp ite of their num erical impor- tance. Hitler, who was a good judge during his entire career of the political importance of people and groups he encoun- tered, knew that all these elements would follow him without hesitation, from the moment he succeeded in coming to terms with the three great contemporary branches of the Prusso- Teutonic group: Junkers, indus trialists, and Reichswehr. The Men Who Mattered In order to achieve such an arrangement, Hider figured that he needed either to come to an agreement with the men in whom these three blocs placed their confidence, or else eliminate these men. The men who mattered were Schacht, Hugenberg, von Papen, and Schleicher. Schacht had influence over heavy industry and the banking circles which were behind this industry. Hitler knew, after his talks with Schacht in 1930, that he could thenceforth count on him unreservedly. Furt hermore he himself had given Schacht and his friends absolute pledges regarding the execu-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 193 tion of the financial and economic plan in which they were interested. Schacht had secured Hitler's promise that after he seized power Schacht would be allowed to return to the direction of the Reichsbank and would be able there to finish the job of financially isolating Germany from the rest of the world. Behind the wall of is olation, rearmament could be ceaselessly pushed and heavy industry would be generously supplied with orders. On Schacht's suggestion, Hitl er was also willing to accept the service of that other faithful servant of the aims of heavy industry: Dr. Walter Funk. Schacht and Funk were to have, from then on, carte blanche in everything concerning the economic action of Nazism. (Goe ring later tried to eliminate Schacht, whom he considered a competitor in the economic field. Although Goering himself had succeeded in establish- ing strong ties with the Pru sso-Teutonic group, he could not get rid of Schacht completely because the latter right down to the present has been supported by big industry.) Hugenberg was the political a nd journalistic henchman of the industrialists. Hitler figured that he would be easy to sat- isfy. A post in the cabinet when Hitler succeeded to power, advantages granted his newspa pers, would be sufficient to keep him quiet so that he c ould later be relegated to the background. Von Papen had as strong an influence over the Junkers as he had over the industrialists, and over the old Marshal as well. He had often played the role of liaison officer between all three and this had given him additional influence. Schleicher in his turn had the full confidence of the Reichs- wehr. Von Papen and Schleicher were therefore, in the eyes of Hitler, the two men with whom he must first reckon if he wished to prepare for his advent to power. He used his for- mula in connection with them firs t of all: either come to an agreement with them, or eliminate them."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"194 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY To come to an agreement with both at once seemed to him impossible. The possible grounds for understanding were dif- ferent in each case. Von Papen, with whom Hitler maintained a close personal relationship, seemed entirely devoted to the feudal interests of the Junkers. On the other hand, Schleicher became more and more critical of these feudal tendencies and maintained relations with the anti-Junker wing of Hitler's own party: Strasser and Roehm. Hitler was kept informed of talks be- tween his lieutenants and Schleicher, and Gregor Strasser tried to persuade him to ally himself definitely with Schleicher. He had to make his choice. Weighing the power and influence of each, Hitler arrived at the conclusion that the Junke rs were the most important force within the Prusso-Teutonic group. Next came heavy industry. These two forces, furt hermore, got along quite well, and von Papen was the man of bo th. He must therefore treat him with respect. Schleicher was the man of th e Reichswehr, and the Reichs- wehr itself only executed the commands of the two other groups; therefore it was a less important force. Hitler's choice was made: he chose, as usual, the stronger. He could get rid of Schleicher without risk if he were supported by von Papen and the powers behind him. The operation he had in mind was not so simple as it sounded. It was a matter of discarding Schleicher and molding von Papen to his wishes. To succeed in this he knew of an infallible method: to set the two men against each other and make them do the job he had in mind. After the fall of Bruening von Papen was a logical candidate for the office of Chancellor. If Hitler could succeed in getting von Papen overthrown through the good offices of Schleicher, and Schleicher later overthrown through the aid of von Papen, the trick would be turned and Hitler himself could succeed to power. By instigating this double action without bringing him-"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE PRUSSO-TEUTONICS APPROACH THEIR GOAL 195 self into the picture, Hitler foresaw the advantage of hav- ing both men find themselves in ditect opposition to each other without getting himself invol ved. This was the classical system so frequently applied in Prussian history when com- peting nations were divided by getting each to believe the Prussians were on their side. Thus Bismarck succeeded in dividing and isolating Denmark from Austria on the one hand, and Austria from France on the other. The same Prussian system was to be used later by Hitler in the international game when he tried to make the nations allied against him believe—one after the other—that he intended to ally himself with that nation against the others. Hitler used this system successfully in 1939 when he man- aged to separate Russia from England; and in 1940 when he made the France of Petain believe that Nazi Germany could be a more valuable ally for France than England. And it was this same system that Hitler tried to apply in 1941, this time without success, when he atte mpted to persuade England and Russia alternately to conclude a separate peace with him so that he could later turn against the other. The game was becoming too transparent for him to succeed every time. But it's true also that the time-honored systems of \"confidence men,\" though often exposed, neve rtheless continue to claim new victims. A further parallel may be draw n between Hitler's actions in inner German politics and the methods he employs in deal- ing with foreign nations. To w eaken his enemy, internal or external, his preferred method is to use the enemy's \"minori- ties\"—whom he wins over to hi s side—to his own advantage; at the same time his own minor ities also serve his purposes. Notwithstanding the traditional fidelity of the Reichswehr toward the Junkets, he knew how to set General Schleicher against the Junkers without putting himself in evidence. He thus succeeded in causing a divi sion among his victims, using the \"minority\" in the opposing camp, while his own \"minori-"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"I 96 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY ties,\" Gregor Strasser and Roehm, were, due to their influence on Schleicher, unconscious tools of this transaction.

Von Papen followed as Chancellor and was succee ded on December 2, 1932, by General von Schleicher. Von Pa pen's and Schleicher's gov- ernments were the last two before Hitler's advent to power on January 30, 1933. The main trends underlying these events were the following: (a) When von Papen succeeded to power he expected to have Hitler's support. It was w ith this in mind that he had procured subsidies from the industrialists for Hitler. The latter's support would be very useful to him, for although he governed with the aid of Presiden tial \"decrees of dissolution,\" no Chancellor could affotd to dismiss the Reichstag too often. The Nazis were the most important party in the Reichstag. Although they did not have a majority at their disposal, their support was nevertheless of great value to a government head. Besides, Hitler was an excell ent \"bogeyman\" who could serve to hold in check the parties of Germany's left, and intimidate countries abroad. The latter, under the effects of this intimida- tion, would be much more apt to make concessions to Ger- many in the direction desired by the Prusso-Teutonics. Von Papen figured that the bargain he had concluded with the Fuehrer was fair and satisfactory to both. He therefore ex- pected it to last, the more so because Hitler could not hope to accede to power himself. Indeed the Marshal had pro- nounced an absolute veto of this possibility and the Reichs- wehr did not look upon it favorably either. (b) Von Papen knew that he could count on the support 197"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"198 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY of the real masters of Germany, the ruling Junker clique and heavy industry. He served them well and had no doubts about his reward. Also, he had been on an equal footing with Schleicher in the overthrow of Bruening, and the general ac- cepted a place in his cabinet as Minister of the Reichswehr. The Reichswehr would therefore be behind him too. Possess- ing, in addition, Hindenburg' s friendship and counting on Hitler's integrity, von Papen imagined that he would remain at the head of the government for many years. (c) Von Papen, believing his re gime to be a lasting one, let it be understood that he had plans reaching far into the future. To consolidate his position positively he projected a reform of the Weimar Constitution, a reform which would have pro- cured him quasi-dictatorial powe rs and would have put an end to the parliamentary system, condemned to death by the Prusso-Teutonics. Then, in the field of foreign policy, von Papen recommended ideas in th e direction of a \"European Federation\" under German contro l, and spoke of a rebirth of the Holy Roman Empire. He had not, of course, taken any of his ideas from Hitler but rath er from purely Prusso-Teutonic sources. Nevertheless one may say th at if he had been able to maintain himself in power he would have tried to carry out, internally as well as abroad, schemes almost identical to those which Hitler was to produce later. The result would have been pr actically the same and prob- ably Prussian Germany unde r von Papen's control would have taken a direction about id entical with the one she took under Hitler. True, von Papen w ould have carried out some of his plans at a different tempo, not possessing Hitler's bru- tally determined spirit.

The characteristic brutality"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE LAST ACT OF THE TRAGICOMEDY 199 of his expression and action has resulted in making the world aware of the threat for which actually the Prusso-Teutonic forces are responsible—more aware than if a more common- place individual, von Papen, for example, had pursued the same course. The reason why von Papen was not the one finally to put these plans into practice for the Prusso-Teutonics was that Hitler did not intend him to be. Hitler was incontestably the stronger of the two. He was not going to allow von Papen to get the credit for the performance, nor to content himself with the role of \"bogeyman.\" He might consider this role but only if he could play it as a star. He had realized that von Papen expected to maintain himself in power as compensation for his faithful service to the Prusso-Teutonics. He therefore decided that he would not let hi m have that privilege: that he himself would occupy that post and serve the same interests with even greater devotion, allowing von Papen at most a position in the background. Blackmail and Intrigue The following sequence of events developed from the inter- play of the motives discussed above: 1.—Von Papen organized his cabinet with Schleicher as Minister of War and representatives of the Junkers as holders of the greater number of portfo lios. Von Papen dismissed the Reichstag and prepared, in agreement with Hitler, new elec- tions in which the Nazis expected to increase their number of seats. The von Papen-Hitler allia nce seemed firmly cemented. 2.—On July 20, 1932, von Papen forcibly removed from office the Socialist government of Prussia. As a reaction against the feudal powers secretly controlling public affairs, the people of Prussia had plac ed Socialist governments in power in the state of Prussia after the Great War. Since"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"200 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Prussia represented about two-thirds of the area and popu- lation of Germany, its Socialist governments were a nui- sance to the feudal powers who intended to keep effective domination over Germany's affair s. By putting an end, with his coup d'Etat, to the contradictory situation existing in Prussia, von Papen rendered another important service to his friends. The Prime Minister of Prussia, Otto Braun, and Severing, Minister of Interior (both of whom were Social- ists), were frightened by the terroristic acts of the Prusso- Teutonics and did not dare to resist, although they had a considerable police force at their disposal. The legal excuse given by von Papen for his coup d'Etat was clearly on uncer- tain ground and was later invalidated by the Supreme Court of Leipzig. No matter; control of Prussian affairs was to remain in the future directly with the Reich. 3.—Von Papen managed to satisfy his \"bosses\" on all mat- ters. Decrees authorized wage reductions. Osthilfe subsidies were granted wholesale to the Junkers. Satisfaction was given the Nazis as well: the measure calling for dispersal of the SA and SS, issued under Br uening, was suspended. 4.—New elections we re held on July 31. The Nazis now obtained 230 seats in the Reichstag out of a total of 608. Hitler did not yet have a majority but he had nevertheless won the day. His future now looked most promising. 5.—On August 13, at von Papen' s suggestion, Hitler went to see President von Hindenburg. The Chancellor thought that Hindenburg's authority would be sufficient to persuade Hitler to accept a post within the cabinet. Von Papen hoped that as part of the government , Hitler would continue his support. Hitler told Hindenburg frankly that he did not want a subordinate place in the cabinet. He wanted to be Chancellor or nothing. Hindenburg went into a rage but it did no good. Hitler gave him to unders tand plainly that from that day on he would be on the opposing side. The Hitler-von Papen alliance was terminated for the time being. It had defi-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE LAST ACT OF THE TRAGICOMEDY 201 nitely served Hitler's purpose because he had obtained the new elections he wanted and ha d come out of these stronger than before. He had also avoided the dissolution of his \"self- defense troops\" which the previous regime had considered. Having secured what he wanted Hitler could now go into opposition to the government. From then on the government was again in danger. 6.—Hitler carried out his threat on September 12. The gov- ernment met with a reverse in the Reichstag, Nazis and Com- munists voting against it. The re sult: 513 against, 32 for. Nevertheless von Papen did not resign; he dissolved Parlia- ment. Elections were set for November 6. In the meantime von Papen arranged to have the industrialists cut off Hitler's subsidies. The Nazis would therefore find themselves in finan- cial straits during the electoral campaign and the election returns would reflect this. Only twelve millions voted for the Nazis instead of the fourteen million at the last election, and as a result the National-Socialist party lost thirty-five seats. 7.—Von Papen, by forcing Hitle r into elections without the financial aid he used to procure for him, hoped to put him into a position of inferiority. He expected that a new agreement with Hitler would thus be easi er to achieve. The Nazi party was indeed passing through a seve re moral and financial crisis. For the first time the most faithful members of the party began to doubt Hitler. Creditors became threatening. But the Nazis, in spite of their losses, were still the most important party in the Reichstag. Von Papen thought he had brought Hitler into line and again offered him a post in the cabinet, even proposing to him the office of Vice-Chancellor. Hitler refused. He was still playing \"all or nothing.\" 8.—The expedient of dissolvi ng the Reichstag could not be repeated ad infinitum. Von Pape n therefore put into execution an idea which he considered a stroke of genius. On Novem- ber 17, 1932, he offered the Pr esident his resignation. He"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"202 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY knew that he would be asked to form a new cabinet. He would take advantage of the crisis to prove that it was quite impossible to constitute a government which would have a majority in the Reichstag. U nder such conditions it could be shown that if any governm ent were to be stable and effective the constitution would have to be changed. Von Papen as Chancellor would rece ive under the new constitution quasi-dictatorial powers. 9.—A strong government might perhaps have been able to effect such a change in the constitution, equivalent, without the approval of the Reichstag, to a coup d'Etat. In order to establish a government of this nature it would have been essential for von Papen to be able to count on full aid of the Reichswehr. However, at the last moment this aid entirely failed him. Schleicher actually declared that he did not wish to be in the new cabinet. At first von Papen thought it was a trick. He continued to bargain with the General, who re- mained adamant, his position taken. Under such conditions there remained no choice for von Papen but to announce, on November 30, that he was unable to organize a new cabinet. 10.—By leaving office von Pa pen thought he was taking a step which would add to his prestige; he expected to return some day. He retained Hindenburg's confidence, as well as that of the Junker-heavy industry group. He did not feel too strongly against Hitler fo r not supporting him, for the Nazi leader had for a long time given him plainly to under- stand that he was not disposed to cooperate except on con- dition that top place be reserved for him. As for Schleicher, who had stabbed him in the back, von Papen wished to wreak vengeance upon him at the first opportunity. 11.—What had inspired Schleicher's attitude? Negotiations with Gregor Strasser, Hitler' s second-in-command as head of the Nazi party, had been the cause. For a long time Strasser had been dissatisfied with Hitler's close connections with the Junkers and heavy industry. He knew that these con-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE LAST ACT OK THE TRAGICOMEDY 203 ncctions had of late been passing through von Papen. As we have seen, Strasser still held to the old \"Socialist\" conception of his party and would have liked to free it of its servitude to the Prusso-Teutonics, toward whom he had always been critical. With this aim, he inclined in the direction of an alliance with Schleicher who willingly let himself be desig- nated as the \"Socialist General.\" Such was the integrity of St rasser that he kept Hitler informed of his negotiations with Schleicher. Hitler encour- aged them, for he saw in them a good way to separate Schleicher from von Papen. Urged forward by Strasser, and indirectly by Hitler, Schleicher had formulated a plan to organize the cabinet himself, succeeding von Papen, whom he dropped from then on, and taking Strasser with him as Vice- Chancellor. Hitler pretended to be willing to accept this combination, but stated his conditions. 12.—While waiting for the matter of Gregor Strasser's entry into his cabinet to be se ttled, Schleicher organized his government on December 2, hoping Strasser would join him in a few days. One of Hitler's conditions had been that Strasser ascertain, before accepting the post of Vice-Chancellor, that Hindenburg's veto regarding himself was still valid. Schleicher took Strasser to the Marshal, who gave him his word of honor that \"the Austrian corporal would never be Reichs- chancellor.\" Strasser considered the matter definitely verified. He informed Hitler of his interview and awaited Hitler's per- mission to accept the post of Vice-Chancellor. Hitler was to arrive in Berlin on December 8 to discuss the question. Strasser waited in vain at the station. Hitler was not on the train. Later in the day Hitler rushed to Strasser's house and violently reproached him, accusing him of having lied. Hitler said that he had just seen von Papen, who had assured him that Hindenburg's word had not been final. Since then Otto Strasser has r ecounted his brother's inter- pretation of this scene.

Indeed Goering and Goebbels had for some time been very jealous of the position occupied by Strasser in the party. Strasser, still confident of Hitler's good faith, felt that only under the influence of Goering and Goebbels could Hitler have believed that his most faithf ul lieutenant had lied to him. Actually it is plain that Hitler , in spite of Strasser's interpre- tation, had been putting on an act during all these discussions. He had never had any intention of allowing Strasser to accept the office of Vice-Chancellor, for he knew that this would give Strasser practically first pl ace in the party, which would not have suited him at all. Mo reover, by entering the cabinet Strasser would considerably for tify Schleicher's position, and this again would not be to Hitler's advantage. Hitler had nevertheless pretended to appr ove of Strasser's negotiations, only for the purpose of eventua lly separating Schleicher and von Papen. Once Schleicher's cabinet had been formed and this separation accomplished, he could afford to reverse his position. The scene he had played before Strasser when he spoke of lies and betrayal, and quoted the testimony of von Papen, Goering, and Goebbels, wa s merely one of those sensa- tional, dramatic stunts which H itler always uses to good ad- vantage when he wants to ex tricate himself from a difficult situation. Strasser let himself be deluded (like so many before and after him) into believing in the sincerity of the actor he was watching, 13.—Gregor Strasser was too weary to continue the struggle. Grieved and deeply shocked that Hitler should believe him a liar, he resigned his position in the party and left for a vacation in Italy. Hitler rubbed his hands with satisfaction; everything had gone as he had hoped. The danger of a strong Schleicher cabinet had been avoided and he could now study the best means of ultimately compromising the \"Socialist General.\""},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE LAST ACT OF THE TRAGICOMEDY 205 14.—Schleicher resigned himself to the fact that he could not count on direct aid from Gr egor Strasser to improve the position of his government. Howeve r, he thought that his tie with the Reichswehr was enough to give him the requisite strength. He did not realize that Hitler, considering him a dangerous rival, had decided his fate. Hitler did not attack in the open, although he had at his disposal in the Reichstag the necessary strength to lead such an attack against Schleicher with every chance of success. But for Schleicher a Reichstag defeat would have been \"honorab le.\" As its sole consequence he would have been forced to resign temporarily, with nothing to prevent him from returning to power later. 15.—The only positive way to prevent any return of Schleicher would be to compromise him in the eyes of the forces actually in control of affairs: the Prusso-Teutonics. The left wing of his party again became the unconscious tool of Hitler. Nazi delegates of Strasser's group (that is, anti- Junker) introduced a question in the Reichstag on the matter of the Osthilfe abuses. General Ludendorff, whose ties to Hitler were well known, led a violent campaign against Hindenburg concerning the circumstances surrounding the deed of gift to Neudeck. In this way Ludendorff gratified his personal jealousy of Hindenburg. For Hitler, this was but one additional use of blackmail to enable him to succeed to power. Schleicher also fell into the trap. Believing—as Hitler in- tended he should—that these attacks had been launched with Hitler's consent, he hoped to s ecure legislative support from the Nazis by promoting the airing of the scandal in the Reichstag and the press. The Soci alists, glad of an opportunity to deal the Junkers a blow , joined in the chorus. 16.—Meanwhile Hitler, directly and through the medium of Goering and Goebbels, maintained close contact with von Papen and through him with the Junkers. He pointed out that Schleicher represented a danger to them because he was"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"206 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY favoring the exposure of the Osthilfe affair. The fact that the flames of this campaign were constantly fanned by Hitler's own acolytes did not embarrass him at all. He explained that he could discipline the fanatics in his parry and guarantee that such incidents would not recur in the future only if he were appointed to the office of Chancellor. 17.—It was all blackmail, but von Papen was thinking only of his revenge on Schleicher. Be sides he had finally realized that Hitler would accept nothing short of the Chancellorship. Hitler, needing von Papen's contacts with the Junkers and the industrialists, had given him to understand that he would be quite ready to cooperate with him on condition that von Papen content himself with a secondary ro le. The West- phalian was probably already re signed to this. He did not feel himself quite equal to a contest with Hitler and preferred to have him as a friend rather than an enemy. A decisive interview took place between the two men in Cologne, at the home of Baron Schroeder, financier of the heavy industry. Hitler gave assurances to his interlocutors that if he were granted the reins of power he would put an end to the soci- alistic sallies of his party's left wing. 18.—Von Papen had no difficulty in persuading his friends, the Junkers and industrialists, that they should henceforth place their bets on Hitler. Only the latter was ready to guar- antee that the Osthilfe scandal would no longer be discussed. Besides, Hitler could carry out as well as he—or perhaps even better, he must admit—the sc heme already outlined by von Papen on which the entire Prussian clique had agreed: con- stitutional reform with complete concentration of power in the hands of the Chancellor, continuation of the work of rearmament behind the screen of Germany's financial isola- tion, inaugurated in 1931; and fina lly, reconstruction by stages of the Germanic Holy Roman Empire.

Hitler would take charge of it thenceforth for the benefit of the same silent partners. 19.—On January 12, Schleicher was \"guest of honor\" at the Landbund banquet. A La ndbund bulletin was passed around containing a violent attack on the Chancellor. Schlei- cher demanded an explanation. It was not given. He was made to feel that the article expre ssed the feelings of the Landbund members and that was all. Schleicher rose and left the hall accompanied by the generals present. He still did not under- stand that his fate was already sealed. Junkers and the Land- bund had let themselves be pers uaded by von Papen, and in the end by Hitler, that Schleicher was dangerous to their interests. He did not realize that nothi ng could save him now, that only the method of his departur e was left to be arranged. Jan Bargenhusen writing in the magazine Die Weltbuehne* on January 24, 1933, said: \"The amount of personal author ity with which Schleicher assumed office is already terribly diminished. The Landbund in particular has treated him badly . . .\" Bargenhusen con- cluded his article with the words: \"The German Reich is a Republic. All power comes from the Landbund.\" 20.—The last act of the tr agicomedy took place at the presidential palace. Hindenbur g still was hesitating about dropping Schleicher, who seemed to have the generals' sup- port. But his son, Oscar, made it clear that Schleicher was promoting revelations about the Neudeck affair and if that continued, a scandal very embarrassing to father and son might well break out. True, the army still favored Schleicher, but on the other hand the Junkers were absolutely against him and this counted much more.

This decree had been granted his predecessors who had ruled with the aid of the threat it contained.

But Hindenburg refused, and Schleicher understood that the President had withdrawn his confidence. He was deeply hurt and resigned. 21.—Nothing remained to be done but to appoint his suc- cessor. Von Papen was prepared to let Hitler have the post. The Junkers agreed. Heavy industry agreed. Why shouldn't they, since there was no other candidate available to accom- plish what had been planned? 22.—Only Hindenburg was still unable to reach a decision. He had given his word of honor that the \"Austrian corporal\" would not be Chancellor. The Junkers therefore arranged a final stunt to speed things up. On January 30, 1933, one of their leaders, Count von Alvensleben, rushed to the Presi- dential palace with the \"scoop\" that Schleicher had put him- self in command of the Pots dam Garrison and was marching on Berlin to arrest Oscar von Hindenburg, Papen, and Hitler. The \"news\" was pure fabrication but it had its effect. Under the stress of emotion Hindenburg finally consented to have Hitler form a government with von Papen as Vice-Chan- cellor. The Nazi regime was born. On January 30, 1933, began the Gleichschaltung. The vari- ous parties were liquidated in succession and a single party, the Nazi party, was left.

From the moment he took the reins of power no one ever spoke of the Osthilfe s candal again (although previously it had often been stirred up by Nazi Deputies in the Reichs- tag) or of \"colonization\" on Junker land. The different anti- Junker slogans of early Nazism were definitely buried by Hitler. The Junkers and Hindenburg breathed a sigh of relief. This business disposed of, work began in earnest on the Prusso-Teutonic scheme. The entire plan carried out by Hitler corresponded point by point with Prusso-Teutoni c intentions. The details are well known. Decree-laws gave H itler dictatorial powers all along the line.

He introduced measure after measure to satisfy the Junkers and the big industrialists. He flattered the Reichswehr too and tried to make it forget that Schleicher, the man of the Reichswehr, had been replaced by himself as the head of the government. As for Schleicher, the latter's grudge was against von Papen rather than Hitler—because he believed it was the former who had been principally respon- sible for his downfall. He never realized that, in the last anal- ysis, everything had been organized by Hitler. Denying the Past But Hitler had a revolutionary past which might be embar- rassing to the interests he was now serving. He had hoisted himself to power by fulminating for years against existing power, including the Prusso-Teutonic forces. Originally Hitler was simply an agitator without a definite purpose, ready to ally himself wi th any group of interests, if he saw some advantage to hi mself from such an alliance. Among his faithful followers were sincere men like Gregor Strasser, who had strong Germ an nationalist feelings but moved in a direction opposed to Prussianism. They ardently desired a German Federation free of any Prussian tinge. While the National Socialist part y had had its headquarters in Munich, it had often displaye d a Bavarian-inspired regional resistance to the centralizing pressure of Prussia. From time to time also, the Nazi party ha d appeared to be a movement with socialistic tendencies, opposed to Junker feudalism. Rbehm's views were of this character, though clearly he was Strasser's moral inferior. But Hitler, who did not feel con- strained by any basic principles and who made allies where he could (or rather, wherever his alert opportunism might lead him), surrounded himself also with men like Goering, the Prussian officer type; like Alfred Rosenberg, who dreamed"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"212 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY of a new Prusso-Teutonic relig ion; and like Goebbels, who would have sold his soul to anyone, but who concluded that selling it to the Prussians would be most profitable. Despite his numerous ties with Prussian interests, for a long time Hitler would eat at anyone's table. His definite alliance with the Prusso-Teutonic for ces was not consummated until early in 1933. Without it he would never have been able to accede to power, nor could he have risen to international im- portance. He would never have been more than a picturesque demagogue in the arena of internal German politics. Hitler was never a world threat until the support of Prusso-Teutonic forces gave him the key to power. The left wing of his parry, Roehm and his three million SA, had taken his earlier promises seriously. These folk no longer understood what was happening. They had believed that the hour of revolution had struck, and demanded changes which might be extremely annoying to the Prussian clique Hitler was now planning to serve. Roehm went so far as to demand control of the Reichswehr by the SA and for himself powers superior to the generals . Decidedly, he did not yet understand what was going on. The man in Hitler's entourage who had \"understood\" from the very beginning was Goering, He had always had personal ties with the Prussian powers. He now put himself more fully at their service. Consequently there was to be no change in his relationships with them and he was to be rewarded for his attitude: he would be permitted to set up his \"Hermann Goeringwerke, A. G.\" within the empire of German heavy industry. Hitler's accession to power became possible because of the confidence of the Prusso-Teutonics. He was well aware that he would be unable to maintain that power unless he managed to preserve this confidence. But the embarrassing activity of Roehm and his troops was imperiling it. Gregor Strasser was still estranged from the throne and his silence signified a con-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA—ALIAS NAZILAND 213 slant reproach to Hitler, reminding him that he had been false to his past. Kahr, leader of the Bavarian Separatists, formerly allied with Hitler, failed also to understand the Chancellor's alliance with the Prussian forces against whom they had striven together. This whol e set was sowing unrest among militant Nazis and creating difficulties for the new Chancellor. Killing the Past In the spring of 1934 the Prusso-Teutomcs became increas- ingly worried over the restlessness in the left wing of the Nazi party. Their cabinet \"lia ison officer,\" von Papen, decided to post a warning. On June 17, 1934, he delivered a speech severely criticizing the revolutionary phases of the Nazi regime. This meant obviously that the Prusso-Teutonics were wondering whether after all they had made a good choice in the person of Hitler, and whether they should not replace him. Von Papen doubtless hoped that as a result of this speech Hitler might be forced out and he himself might again suc- ceed to the office. He was adaptable and managed to fit him- self into a subordinate office, but if the necessity for change arose von Papen was not averse to playing first fiddle him- self, under the baton, of course, of the same band-leaders as before. But Hitler clung desperately to his office and was prepared for any sacrifice to keep it. To meet the situation he impro- vised, as so often in his caree r, and his improvisation bore the usual stamp of his intuitive br utality. Goering had the same understanding of affairs as he, and followed him wholeheart- edly, while Goebbels and Hess trailed along in more retiring fashion. The bloody purge of June 30, 1934, born of this inspiration, was a master stroke. Hitler orga nized it solely to regain the confidence of the Prussian clique. Gregor Strasser and Roehm were executed.

Schleicher was also k illed. Despite his origin he had dared while in power to further a policy opposing Junker interests. Moreover, he reme mbered his negotiations with Strasser and Roehm and might possibly reveal at some future date the promises both had made in Hitler's name (and surely with his consent) for the purpose of arousing him to action against the Junkers. If Schleicher had survived the execution of Strasser and Roehm, he might at any moment have become an extremely embarrassing witne ss. Kahr naively had signed his own death warrant by remi nding Hitler that he had once been on the other side of the fence, with the Bavarian Separa- tists against the Prussian powers. Von Papen's arrest on the same date was necessary to make him clearly understand that Hitler had no intention of aban- doning the position of \"first fiddle.\" He had to accept with a smile the execution of his assistants. They had been unwise enough to draw up the speech delivered by von Papen and had dared to recommend that the powers behind the scenes accord their confidence to someone other than Hitler. Since they were persons of no importance, no one would protest their deaths. Eventually von Papen was freed and was permitted to con- tinue \"to serve.\" The bonds between him. and the Prusso- Teutonic forces were too close to allow Hitler to sacrifice him entirely. He deserved a warning and Hitler was satisfied with that much. By executing Schleicher, Kahr, Strasser, Roehm, and nu- merous other militant members of his own parry having similar tendencies, Hitler had silenced embarrassing witnesses of his past. He had equally in this way arrested any future desire, within the Nazi party, to proceed in a direction opposing the interests of the Prussian forces . Besides he could now say to his Prusso-Teutonic masters: \"For you have I sacrificed my"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA- ALIAS NAZILAND 215 best friends. I have eliminated Schleicher as well, who dared oppose you. What better proof could I furnish of my absolute devotion to your interests?\" True, the Reichswehr, which was part of the Prusso-Teu- tonic clan, was angry at him for Schleicher's death. But Hitler knew that Junkers and industrialists were more powerful within the group than the Reichswehr, and in the course of his career he had never hesitated to betray weaker interests for the advantage of stronger ones. Possessing the confidence of Junkers and industrialists, he was certain that nothing could happen to him, and now that the general who had been bothering him was no longer pres ent, he applied himself thenceforward to appeasing the Reichswehr too. Like a real \"confidence man\" he knew the best methods to regain the con- fidence of those whom he had tricked. Early in January, 1935 he read a declaration before an officers' society restoring Schleicher's \"honor,\" the officers were pleased, and tranquility returned. The contempt which the Prussian General Staff felt for tne Austrian Corporal did not disa ppear overnight, but they no longer disputed his orders. Despite appearances to the con- trary, orders were no longer given in his name, nor in the name of Nazism (which had changed completely from its earlier form). Hitler was now speaking in the very name of the ancient Prusso-Teutonic caste of which the army officers were members, and whose supr eme servant Hitler had be- come. The Anti-Semitic Camouflage Since then, what is now known as Nazi Germany has been the very prototype of what the Prusso-Teutonics might have dreamed in their most optimistic moments.

Anti-Semitic camouflage has been put by Hitler to excellent tactical advantage. He knew that he could maintain his influ- ence over the masses if he succeeded in preserving the revolu- tionary appearance of his moveme nt. In the past he had be- rated Junkers, heavy industry, Jews and Communists indis- criminately. He could no longer say anything against Junkers and the industrialists—they we re now his masters. There remained the Jews and Communist s. To make up for what he had lost in area of attack he would intensify his brawling against the latter two groups. Fo rmer Communists were more numerous in Germany than Jews; it was therefore chiefly against the latter that he loosed his attacks. It was always preferable to march first against the weakest minority, thereby winning the sympathies of all w ho were not affected by these attacks and who consequently believed themselves privileged. Julius Streicher, filth-mongering editor of the Stuermer, had never been in the circle of Hitler's intimates. His move- ment had evolved on the fringe of the Nazi parry. Nevertheless ever since he came into power Hitler drew from Streicher the inspiration for his anti-Semitic campaigns. Once he arrived at the conclusion, for the reasons stated, that it was good policy to intensify this campaign, it was natural, in order to go about it in the best way, for him to call upon the specialist. One should not for a moment forget that the anti-Semitic movement was, for Hitler, chiefly a \"smoke-screen\" which served to hide his real inten tions. The suffering of Jews in Germany and in territories occupied by the Nazis deserves all our sympathy, but the real danger which Hitler represents is quite another.

The same class has preser ved through the ages, from the thirteenth century to our day, the same ambitions for un- limited conquest. This class and their ambitions have been hidden, at various points in Pru ssian history, behind different screens. Now this front is called \"Hitler,\" as tomorrow it may be called \"Goering,\" \"von Pa pen,\" or \"Thyssen.\" The men have changed through the ages but the forces controlling them and the methods employed have remained the same. We may add that Fritz von Thyssen's \"flight\" to Paris in April, 1940 was clearly designed to build up his prestige in the eyes of the Allies and to use him, if it becomes necessary to sacrifice Hitler, as a new front behind which the Prusso- Teutonic game could be carried on. Indeed, in the beginning of the war, Germany's masters were somewhat uncertain about the results they might expect from Hitler's blitz tech- nique. Thyssen's trip to Pari s was decided upon in order to prepare for a new camouflage in case of an unsatisfactory outcome of the war. The successful invasion of France made such precautions appear to be superfluous. After Thyssen's return to Germany, \"under heavy guard\" to keep up appearances, it was learned that he was living quietly in a sanitarium in a fashionable Ber- lin suburb, instead of having be en executed for having turned \"traitor\"—as everybody would have expected.

Exactly the opposite is true. Hitler, in order to become Chancellor, concluded a bargain with the Prusso-Teutonic powers and to this day has rigidly adhered to that bargain. It is true that ever since this agreement was made Ger- many has appeared in the eyes of the world in the guise of \"the Nazi regime.\" It must not be forgotten, however, that Hitler has permitted to remain alive only as much of the Nazi system as suits the Prussian pow ers. He has suppressed every- thing that ran counter to those forces, including the \"socialis- tic\" and \"revolutionary\" nature of Nazism. The word \"Nazi\" has taken, since 1933—1934, a different meaning from what it had before, narrower and broader at the same time: narrower because it no longer corresponds at all to the program of early Nazism, and broader because of its use as a new cloak for Prusso-Teutonic ambitions. In practice this means that Hitler, unpredictable character though he is, acts as leader only within certain limits, and these limits are prescribed by the powers operating as his \"bosses.\" He has never come to any decision which would not have been fully approved by the Junkers and heavy in- dustry, preponderant elements of the Prusso-Teutonic group. He appears now and then to be in disagreement with the Generals, but then it should not be forgotten that the Reichs- wehr is only a kind of \"junior partner\" in the Prussian com- pany. Because of the professional pride which has always characterized military career men everywhere, the Rcichswehr does not always submit blindly to the will of its associates. This was evident even in Schleicher's time and more recently as well, when, for example, General von Brauchitsch was recalled.

Hugenberg was forced to dissolve his party and had himself to resign from the first Hitler cabinet on June 27, 1933. The misapprehension stems from the fact that one may confuse \"rightist parties\" w ith \"Prusso-Teutonic powers.\" The parties of the right were, i ndeed, liquidated by Hitler but not the forces behind them. Hitler considered the rightist part ies as rivals. It is there- fore understandable that one of his first considerations should have been to destroy them. Bu t he knew that these parties were only fronts for more pow erful forces. He never at- tempted to eliminate these forces for which he had always had a great respect. All he wanted was merely to become their sole agent and sole facade for the future. On this condition, he was ready to serve them blindly. The highly competitive struggle between the so-called German Nationalists and Hitler was perfectly defined by Roberr d'Harcourt on February 20, 1933, barely three weeks after Hitler's accession to power, in the French Catholic review, Etudes: \"Rarely have two parties waged a struggle as fierce as the Racists have against the supporters of Hugenberg.

To the young, and also to the embittered, they appeared to be revolutionaries. Their greatest strength was a vast stoc k of vague expectations and confidence in the overthrow of things as they were. In the eyes of the discontented unstable element the German na- tionalists [i.e., the Hugenberg followers] had the disadvan- tage of appearing as a party of money-bags, of gorged in- dividuals—and at the same t ime, a mummified group. AH the forces of reaction congregated within this party: industrial magnates, great agrarians of the East, capitalists of every color, banded together to obstruct th e road of revolution with a strong-box, and raise a wall of money against the barri- cade.\" The \"Nationalists\" had made the mistake of permitting reactionary influences which hi d behind them to be seen too clearly. This was bound to render them unpopular. It was therefore not surprising that their representation in the Reichstag should have been the smallest. The Prusso-Teu- tonics had nothing to gain any longer by encumbering them- selves with such a troublesome, weak front. It constituted a handicap to them from the moment they were able to replace it by the younger, more vigorous front offered by Hitler. The exchange was wholly to their advantage. It is not astonishing that they should ha ve accepted it as soon as they believed Hitler's promises that he would faithfully serve them. These promises had been given di rectly, as well as through the medium of von Papen, during the weeks preceding January 30, 1933. When in 1934 doubts arose among the Prusso- Teutonics as to Hitler's sincerity, he felt it necessary to reaf- firm his unlimited devotion by the radical act of the blood purge of June 30, 1934. \"He goes to the length of sacrificing his most faithful lieutenants for us,\" said the Prusso-Teutonics, and they voiced no further doubts concerning his fidelity."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA-ALIAS NAZILAND 221 A Well-Constructed Hierarchy One may wonder why Hitler, who betrayed so many in the course of his career, including his most intimate friends, should never have attempted to betray the Prusso-Teutonics. It is the only bargain Hitler seems to have kept. The reason is simple: he believes them very strong and more powerful than any other group in Germany, and therefore prefers to travel in their wake. It is certainly not moral considerations which prevent betrayal on his part. Hitler saw, during his long years of struggle to gain control of the ruling office of Germany, that it was always the men momentarily in the confidence of the Prusso-Teutonics who held this post. For years and years he had concentrated, there- fore, on becoming that henchman serving the same forces and eliminating all rivals. After con centrating so long on this single aim he was not going to risk, by any false move, alienating the masters in whose power he believed. If he had wished to revolt against these forces, the natural thought would have been for him to lean on his own party as all the support that was needed. This in short was the solution proposed by Gregor Strasser and Roehm. But Hitler, a cynic, had reached the conclusion that \"popular\" forces— groups which appeared in the public eye and whose member- ship was open to the great ma sses of the people—were much less powerful than occult, closed forces, whose success was guaranteed by their firm internal organization. The Prusso- Teutonics had all the earmarks of a group organized in occult, or at least closed, fashion. In comparison with these forces the Nazi party must be considered an open, \"popular\" organiza- tion. (The fact that the Nazi party had been built up by demagogic means does not detract at all from its open, popu- lar character.) The Nazi party has weight due to its numbers; the Prusso-Teutonic group, to the nature of its conspiracy.

Hitler realized that he could make the mass membership of the Nazi party serve him and he intended in turn to put him- self at the service of the Prusso-Teutonic conspiracy. In this there was an hierarchical gradation from which Hitler, con- trary to Gregor Strasser and Roehm, has never wished to break away. Since January 30, 1933, Hitler has devoted himself—with the aid of the Prussian forces—to the achievement of the old plans of the Teutonic Knights, of the great Elector, of Fred- erick the Great, and of Bismarck. In international matters, all Hitler's acts and decisions are what one would expect from any agent of the old Prusso- Teutonic scheme. But to a world unprepared for them they are the startling manifestati on of a newly risen universal danger. He spent a few short months exclusively on internal Gleich- schaltung, eliminating every tr ace of the Weimar Republic and suppressing any possibility of disturbance from that source. The \"authoritarian regime\" which has always been a Prussian dream was fully achieved within a very short time. Then, in the month of Oct ober, 1933, Germany withdrew from the disarmament conference of the League of Nations. The whole Prusso-Teutonic class was jubilant and the \"heavy industry\" wing in their midst feverishly prepared for heavy armament production. A few mont hs of internal unrest fol- lowed which suggested the possibility of a split between Nazis and Prusso-Teutonics. But Hitler put an end to all that on June 30, 1934, and everything was straightened out. The Ancient Conquering March Rid of all disturbing elements, Hitler and the Prusso- Teutonics could thenceforth devote themselves completely to"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA ALIAS  NAZILAND 223 the achievement of their common plan. The stages of this task followed one another in ra pid succession. In March, 1935, conscription was again introduced into the German Army and Navy. This occurred in spite of prohibitions of the Versailles Treaty. In March, 1936, Germany occupied the left bank of the Rhine. Occupation of Austria followed in March, 1938; the \"peaceful\" occupation of the Sudetenland in September, 1938, secured under armed threat; the rest of Czecho-Slovakia occupied in March, 1939; annexation of Memel in the same month through pressure on Lit huania; and finally in Septem- ber, 1939, occupation of Poland. The ancient conquering march of the Prusso-Teutonics was on again, directed along lines of least resistance; it was only the la st of the above movements of expansion that excited world resistance and thereby the pres- ent war. The task of secret rearmament, begun by the Prusso- Teutonics immediately after th e German defeat of 1918 and completed with the help of the Fehme's activities, had pro- duced its results. \"God has erected our Empire befo re the Kings of the Earth,\" wrote Emperor Frederick II, who launched the Prusso-Teu- tonic forces on the path of conquest. From Frederick Barba- rossa, who dreamed of himself as dominus mundi, to Hitler, who dreams of similar things, is but a step. The guiding diplomatic principles are identical with those of the old Teutonic Order. In the expansion of territory, no friendship or treaty is an obstacle and any excuse is valid. The precepts of Prusso-Teutonic theoreticians are followed, such as the teachings of von Buelow, who held that: \". . . it is first necessary to attack on e's neighbor, before coming to more distant States. If this rule is not observed, countries separating the two main advers aries may declare themselves either with or against the gr eat empire. Should they declare themselves against this power everything is changed, since a coalition of little States is equivalent to one big State.\""},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"224 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The \"New Order\" Is an Old Order More recent occupations of countries by Germany (Nor- way, Denmark, Holland, Belgiu m, France, Yugoslavia, etc.) at first glance may appear as simple strategic occupation. If one examines them more closely one can perceive, however, that the Prusso-Teutonic powers took advantage of each invasion of foreign territory, fro m the first day of occupation, to prepare in the most thoroughgoing scientific manner for the permanent subjugation of the occupied country. This was accomplished first of all on the economic level, where the Prusso-Teutonics' interests primarily are. They are well aware that economic control leads automa tically to political control. German economic agencies follow closely on the heels of armies of occupation and endeavor to transform the tem- porary hold on conquered countries into a permanent eco- nomic control. Until the present this operation has succeeded much more completely in a country like France, where local authorities have accepted the idea of \"collaboration\" than in countries occupied against the resistan ce of their governments. In France capture of control of corporations through forced sale to Germans took place with a show of legality because French authorities and courts, under pressure from Vichy, countenanced these transactions. The Prusso-Teutonics know that military occupation of France cannot last forever. Be- sides, they have probably considered the possibility of a German defeat which would brin g about the fall of the Nazi regime. They must have said to themselves that even in that case conquest of France would have yielded them the key advantages they had hoped to gain: they figured that it would be extremely difficult for the French to find the legal forms to get rid of German control over nearly the whole of their national economy.

This would be true even for a government under no obligation to respect the agreements of Vichy. It would of course be more true for any French government recogniz ing Vichy laws and decrees. All of this entered into the preparation for what Hitler calls the \"New Economic Order. \" This \"New Order\" is in its entirety the old Prussian scheme of List, which ninety years before Hitler's reign provided the blueprint for the creation of European economic unity under domination of a Prussian Germany. It also pr ovided for subsequent expansion of this Prusso-Teutonic Europe through invasion of the markets of other continents, and establishment of \"protector- ates\" throughout the world. This scheme had always been close to the hearts of the Prusso-Teutonic powers of Germany and had been placed by Dr. Schacht and Dr. Funk in the foreground of the aims pursued by Hitler. Territorial con- quest has a meaning subordinate to economic conquest, ac- cording to List's formula. An army of German accountant s and auditors was installed in Paris, following the army of soldiers, to draw up \"inven- tories\" of all important French enterprises. After these inven- tories were drawn up German offi cials and delegates of private German industry called upon the va rious enterprises to secure for themselves absolute and quite legal control of these firms by the aid of political pressures of every sort and especially by means of the aid lent by \"collaborators\" within the French government. All this is in no sense a product of Hitler's invention or of Nazism. Neither is it the result of private initiative of a \"racketeering\" sort, springing up perhaps because of the complacency of certain German military authorities.

The Anti-Christian Current Aside from his conquest and these efforts to establish a \"New Economic Order\" under German domination, Hitler's \"innovations\" are primarily in the religious domain. In order not to lose the sympathies of that section of German popula- tion which is deeply devoted to the Catholic or Protestant Churches, he approached this subject with many precautions during the early period of his rule. For some time, however, this aspect of his regime ha s come to the foreground in Ger- many and the world press has long dealt with the evident efforts of Hitler to substitute a purely Germanic faith for all forms of religion having foreign connections. It is openly said in Germany today that Mein Kampf should replace the Bible and it is hinted that Hitler will some day replace Christ. Certain observers called attention to the fact that Hitler had definitely created something new at least in the field of religion. All \"religious innovati ons\" now taking place in Ger- many are generally attributed to Nazism. But if we reread what Professor N. A. Cramb said in 1913 about German aims in the domain of religi on (see pages 107-110) we must admit that in this sphere as well Hitler's \"innovations\" cor- respond point by point with the ancient Prusso-Teutonic scheme. Creation of a new wo rld religion, purely Teutonic in character, appears in this light to be as important a goal in the whole scheme as the aims of political and economic con- quest: \"It is reserved for us to resume in thought that creative role in religion which the whole Teutonic race abandoned fourteen centuries ago,\" young Germans told Cramb in 1913. Judaea and Galilee struck Germany in the splendor and hero- ism of her prime.

They conquered Rome, but, dazzled by Rome's authority, they adopted the religion and the culture of the vanquished.\" And Cramb adds: \"Thus while proposing to found a world-empire, Germany is also proposing to create a world-religion.\" Seen in this light the violent anti-Semitic campaigns of Hitler are blows against the combined Judeo-Christian reli- gions: these first blows are directed at the weakest branches of a single tree. The basic idea came from the Prusso-Teu- tonics and even Hitler's methods of employing it are of old Prussian inspiration: to attack first the weakest of one's adver- saries and then only to extend the attack to the others, one at a time. This tactic makes possi ble clever propaganda which spreads the belief that only the minority group is the enemy, in this case the Jews. This anti-Christian current is a very ancient Teutonic trend. It is true that the Holy Roman Empire was, in its origins, profoundly Occidental and Christian; but the strug- gles waged against the Papacy by the Emperors who suc- ceeded one another brought out atavistic, essentially anti- Christian elements in these men as a reaction. Thus there had been, as we have seen, two men in Emperor Frederick II. In his youth he pursued an imperial vision of Occidental idealism. Later he became a hard man, the \"hammer\" of his century, a new Attila whose moral concepts were no longer Christian but quite close to those of the barbarians. It was precisely this Frederick II—\"second edition\" (who was not so different from his grandfather, Barbarossa) who had intrusted an imperial mi ssion to the Teutonic Knights. By acting thus he had automatically transmitted to them his basically anti-Christian principles , or at least a-Christian and amoral (according to our concept of the word \"moral\"). The Teutonic Order has pursued through the centuries this tradi- tion and has, so to speak, crysta llized it by giving it permanent form and even accentuating its anti-Christian direction. It is"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"228 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY therefore not astonishing that the Teutonic Order should have been so frequently in conflict with the Papacy. The Prussia created by the Teutonic Knights and the Prussian spirit which evolved finally handed down to the present the anti-Christian tendencies observed by Cramb in 1913. When Alfred Rosenberg travels around Germany setting up his \"Ordensburgen\"—in which young Germans are in- doctrinated with the principles of the new Teutonic religion —he is definitely inspired by the old tradition of the Teutonic Order. He is, moreover, right in calling these institutions \"Ordensburgen,\" because each ancient \"Burg\" of the \"Order\" in the past centuries filled the same role as the recent institu- tions of the same name: The ancient Ordensburgen were out- posts of Teutonic thought and expansion in Slavic countries. The Teutonic Order and its offshoot, the intermingled Prusso-Teutonic forces, have ke pt alive the Teutonic spirit of revenge against the Christian influence. The tradition of the Fehme has evolved on parallel tracks and was inspired by the same spirit. The spirit of the great mass of the peaceable and profoundly Christian German population has through the ages provided a striking contrast. Observers during all this time have taken account of only this latter aspect of affairs and have not attached sufficient importance to the Teutonic forces which were awaiting their hour. The belief in a Teutonic Messiah was always alive in these circles: Barbarossa was asle ep in his mountain* and would come forth some day to lead hi s people toward new destinies. Hitler expects to be this Teutonic Messiah. In this respect also he intends to take advantage of ideas which were set in motion long before his time. He knows how to \"steal the show\" in every field. He expects from his faithful that they take him with a respectful se riousness, as becomes a Barba- rossa redivivus.

The second Reich had been, in the interpretation of Hitler's faithful, that of Bismarck (although the latter had never so described it), and the first, that of Barbarossa. The figure three leads back to the figure one, as the Holy Trinity sym- bolizes the one God. Hitler, or rather Hess and Rosenberg —his experts in \"mystic matters\"—, were clever at choosing their symbols to catch the public imagination. Destruction of the Family The Prusso-Teutonics succeeded in liberating themselves completely from the background common to Western civili- zation: the Greco-Christian moral philosophy. The fight against the Christian spirit is thus an organic part of Prusso- Teutonism; Bismarck's famous \"Kulturkampf,\" directed against the Catholic Church, and Hitler's open battle against all Judeo-Christian religions can be considered logical—simply as a part of this fight. We must put into the same class the methodi cal attempts made in Germany to break up the traditional concept of the family as well as the efforts to introduce into the relations between young people of the two sexes a lack of restraint directly opposed to Western ideas. The encouragement of sexual relations between girls and boys of neighboring youth camps and the propaganda advan ced in schools to accustom the girls to the idea of having illegitimate children \"for the State\" or \"for Hitler\" are not accidental occurrences. They are part of a systematic plan to break up all the social forms and customs on which Greco-Christian society was built. This program has been extended even to the territories oc- cupied by Germany.

It was adopted, however, as an organic part of the Greco-Christian moral c oncept. It evolved out of an elementary philosophy of life in which was latent the idea of the \"primacy of the human person.\" The Individual, instead of being submerged in the Tribe or in the State, forms his own little universe, the Family—and all further development of Society starts at that point. The undermining of the ideas* on which the family has been built up means something fur- ther: the suppression of a unit in which the individual was able to find shelter from the uniformity and the exactions of the Tribe or the State. German policy in the matter of the sexual education of youth thus appears as an organic part of the plan to submerge the individual within the State—the Prusso- Teutonic State, of course, even if the individual is Alsatian or Polish. No girl should be selfish enough to save herself for her future husband or to be dominated by thoughts of the family she may wish to raise. Such thoughts are no longer a virtue. They are a crime against the State: children should be begotten only for the State. \"There is but one virtue—to forget one- self as an individual,\" said Fich te and von Bernhardi long ago. The individual's thought of procreating should be governed only by the needs of the State. And if these children are born out of wedlock, so much the better: without family attach- ments they will be much more willing to submit themselves to the State. The Five Prussian Characteristics We may now recapitulate the various traits which are in- herent in \"Prussianism.\" We can find five such traits, or characteristics. First, there is the threefold mark mentioned in * i.e., those opposed to promiscuous sexual relations, those referring to the first allegiance of children to the head of the family, etc."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA—ALIAS NAZILAND 231 Chapter II as particularly characteristic of the Teutonic Order. Let us review the meaning of each of these traits: (1) The Teutonic harshness of the Knights. This appeared on many occasions as the barbaric element in Prussianism. This is the trait which goes back directly to pre-Christian days. It explains the many cr uelties apparent in the Third Reich which so often shocked the Western World. (2) The egotism of caste and the arrogance of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights were of noble descent. The Order itself was described symbolically as a \"Hospital\" of the German nobles, a sort of charitable self-help institution with the pur- pose of procuring due and undue privileges for the caste members. We are facing here the feudal element in Prussian- ism; in its name were committed the numerous abuses for which the Junkers so often were criticized. This created and encouraged in Prusso-Teutonic Germany an atmosphere of corruption strangely fused with the so-called \"higher goals.\" This element is also responsible for the famous arrogance of the German Junkers and officers which has frequently aroused world-wide resentment. (3) The fanaticism and the \"disciplinarian\" mentality de- rived front the monastic origin of Prussianism. The Teutonic Knights acted in the most un-Christian manner and were often in open struggle with the Church. Nevertheless a severe mo- nastic rule reigned supreme within the Order in contradiction to the frequently un-Christian outward conduct of the Teu- tonic brethren. It is true that in this rule the accent was on discipline and not on Christian spirit. This rule was inspired by the statutes of the two other Knights' orders in the Holy Land, especially by those of the Templar Order. The strict- ness of these statutes was a guarantee of survival for these Orders. The leaders of the Teutonic Knights wanted to insure survival of their Order by using the same means. In spite of their frequent opposition to the teachings of the Church they"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"232 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY could employ monastic rule because this was not necessarily- Christian. The traditions of the Sicilian-Norman State in which Emperor Frederick II had been raised also influenced these statutes toward the same disciplinarian spirit. From this source the Order inherited especially its conception of a State led by officials governed by the same rigid discipline. Out of this monastic fanaticism and disciplinarian mentality evolved the famous \"Prussian discipline\" of the German army and officialdom; and also the intolerance characteristic of most institutions in present-day Germ any. This is the trait in Prusso-Teutonic Germany which is at the antipodes of any \"sense of humor.\" But this monastic fanaticism in the Knights' times also meant absolute devotion to the cause of the Order and utter disregard of the \"primacy of the human person.\" This primacy was a Chri stian principle but its appli- cation was necessarily lost in th e rigid monastic structure of the Teutonic Order: the Order' s interests took precedence over those of Christianity a nd mankind. In the course of centuries the Teutonic Order developed into the Prussian State. The absolute devotion which originally had been ac- corded to the Order now was directed toward the State. This devotion in modern times took shape as the German totalitarian idea applied by the Prusso-Teutonics in connec- tion with the Prussian-controlled German State. Besides this threefold mark, the Teutonic Order had two further characteristics. These were the ones directly inherited from the Hohenstaufen Emperors: (a) ambition aiming at world domination; (b) fight (undercover or open) against the Christian spirit. These two aims were closely connected. As we have seen, the Hohens taufens concerned themselves only with the unlimited extension of their own power in the direction of world domination—toward which the Church took (and had to take by its very nature) a strongly critical attitude."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA—ALIAS NAZILAND 233 The Teutonic Order inherited from the Hohenstaufens both these ambitions and the spirit of resistance against the supremacy of the Church and Ch ristian teachings in general. In the isolated hot-house of Eastern Prussia these two \"Leit- motivs\" grew to gigantesque proportions through the cen- turies. These five characteristics were perpetuated by the inner circle of the Order and late r by the Junker organizations. They still pervade present-day Prussianism. They have even obtruded themselves into the foreground to such an extent that their sudden appearance in the limelight has surprised the world. It has not been fully real ized that this is no spontaneous creation of Nazism, but that these characteristics have for centuries been inherent in Prussianism, It is due to the five traits or tendencies we have described (two of which were inherited from the Hohenstaufen Em- perors, three developed within the Teutonic Order) that Prusso-Teutonic Germany (Hitlerian Germany today) seems to be so utterly different from the rest of the world. And it is also because of the same characteristics that it is so different from that other Germany: the Germany of Greco-Christian culture—which used to be the Germany before Prussian domination was established over all German nations; and which may still exist, to a limited extent, in a part of the country—or at least in certain German homes. The All-Important Fight Against the Christian Spirit Of the five characteristics of Prusso-Teutonic Germany, the two inherited from the H ohenstaufen Emperors de- scribed under (a) and (b) are th e most significant and the most important. These—\"ambition aiming toward world dom- ination\" and \"fight against the Christian spirit\"—appear as the basic driving forces. It is qu ite natural that this should be so, since the Tectonic Order accepted these two aims when it"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"234 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY embarked on the Borussian adve nture and consciously carried them forward through the centuries. The \"fight against the Christian spirit\" seems to be the more all-embracing of these two aims. It is even a kind of prerequisite to the other a im—unlimited imperialism—because the Christian spirit is necessarily opposed to domination of the world by a single group or St ate. Also, it was possible for the other three characteristic s of Prusso-Teutonic Germany which we have described to develop into what they are today only because of the basic anti -Christian tendency of the Order, and in later times of the Prusso-Teutonics. The Teutonic harshness and ego tism of caste, lacking all limitations set by Christian morality, made possible the cruel- ties and abuses for which the Te utonic Knights were infamous in Prussia, the peculiar practices of the Fehme in the Middle Ages and particularly in its revived, more cruel form after World War I, and the present inhuman mass-killings of the civilian population in the Uk raine, Yugoslavia, etc. The unlimited devotion to the State 'without the humaniz- ing influence of Christian morality is at the origin of such statements of principles as those contained in the writings of the Prusso-Teutonic theoreticians (see Chapter I)*—state- ments which Western people wi th their Greco-Christian background feel are basically opposed to their way of think- ing. This also explains the co nstant lying and broken promises of the Teutonic Order where advantages for the Order's State were at stake; and also the same attitude in more recent Prussian history—particularly in the case of Bismarck, whose Machiavellism and cynicism are surpassed only by Hitler's. This peculiar type of devotion to the interests of the State finds justification for the mo st evil actions, provided they benefit the State. * For example: \"Right belongs to thos e who are victorious in war\"; \"The right of conquest is universally recogni zed\"; \"Strength is the highest law\"; \"Without war we would find degenera te races\"; \"War is a sound panacea for the people\"; \"Everything has its pri ce\"; \"The State is an end in itself.\""},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"PRUSSO-TEUTONIA-ALIAS NAZILAND 235 Secret Germany One may ask whether there is an actual secret organization behind the Junkers and the Prusso-Teutonics or whether the familiar Prusso-Teutonic organizations are responsible for the sequence of events presented in this book. Really secret organizations sel dom betray their existence by outward signs. Neverthe less the founding of the secret \"Soci- ety of Lizards\" (Eidechsengesellschaft) is an historical fact. Reliable historians ha ve related how this society tried to pull the strings in Prussia while the Order of the Teutonic Knights still existed. Kotzebue attributes to the activities of this secret society the secularization of Prussia. The unilinear evolution which has taken place since then— in Prussia and in a Germany dominated by Prussia—and which corresponds point by point to the basic principles of the Society of Lizards might be considered sufficient circum- stantial evidence of the survival of a secret Prusso-Teutonic organization right down to our time. But there is more. The entire process of Prussian growth seems to be inspired by an uninterrupted organic plan. The continuity in the achieve- ment of this plan while the Teutonic Order was responsible for the growth can well be understood. No interruption in the logic of events is observable, however, even since the time when the Order ceased to manage the affairs of Prussia. The natural thought, of course, is that the Society of Lizards, which was—while the Order still existed—its rival for in- fluence in Prussia, secretly carried forward the same plans on its own; and that the same Society inspired the Great Elector, Frederick II, Bismarck, Wilhelm II, and the different leaders of Germany since 1918.

So-called \"secret societies\" sprang up from one da y to the other all over Ger- many—societies which were secretive as regards the details of their decisions and activities, but whose existence itself was a secret from nobody. All these se cret societies were closely connected among themselves; and there was no rivalry be- tween them. Their activities complemented each other won- derfully. Even a superficial obs erver must conclude that all this was possible only if these societies received instructions from the same hidden, absolutely secret sources. The fact that the Fehme terror sprang up so rapidly, so \"spontaneously\" after the first World War tends to confirm the view that the decision to institute this terror must have been reached by a very small group operating secretly. It is extremely difficult to imagine that a large, openly organized association like the Reichs -Landbund (the professional or- ganization of the Junker landowners), or a social club like the Herrenklub (to which nobody but the cream of the Prusso-Teutonics was admitted), could overnight have taken such a grave decision as the starting of a new blood tribunal. Matters of this delicate character can be decided only by a few people who are party to the same secret, and bound by the same vows. Unless this c ondition exists, endless discus- sions ensue which hinder a quick decision; and the danger of betrayal exists.

The descendants of those who, acting in the Society of Lizards, displaced the ancient Order from Prussia—and con- tributed thus to its disint egration—now claimed for them- selves the right to appear cloaked in the dignity of those whose place they had taken. (From their point of view they were perfectly right to do so : although they had displaced the Order, they actually were carrying on the Order's tradi- tions. They acted like a man who secures control of a cor- poration by the foulest means and then, continuing on the original policies of the enterprise, makes speeches to the glory of his predecessor.) Not much was said about the activities of the revived Order, but its yearly conventions in East Prussia were generally noted by th e German newspapers. A few months after the beginning of the present war, a short notice appeared in German papers a nnouncing that Hitler himself had been initiated into the Teutonic Order. No information is published a bout the internal organiza- tion of the contemporary Prusso-Teutonic Order, nor about its exact connections with wh at—if it still exists—is the present-day survival of the Society of Lizards. In a word, we cannot expect to find documentary evidence about the precise functioning of \"Secret Germany,\" but we do not need more than circumstantial evidence for our pur- poses. In this connection it is in teresting to note that in May, 1924, when the 700th anniversary of the University of Naples, a University founded by Empe ror Frederick II, was cele- brated, a crown was found near the sarcophage of the Em- peror in the Cathedral of Palermo with the following inscrip- tion: \"Seinem Kaiser und Helden Das geheime De utschland\" (\"To Their Emperor and Hero , from Secret Germany)\"* This Secret Germany, whatever may be the form in which it * From: E.

It is this Secret Germany, this Germany carrying on a cen- turies-old conspiracy, about which the Deputy Garcis spoke in 1921 in the Bavarian Landtag, and which caused his mur- der. It is this same Germany which, as we have seen, brought Hitler to power and has enabled him to appear in the eyes of the world as a great conqueror, or a great criminal—depend- ing on the point of view. If we assume the existence of a Secret Germany, the open Junker organizations like the Reichs-Landbund and the Her- renklub—which also derive from the Order of the thirteenth century—have only a secondary role, carrying out instruc- tions of the secret group like all the other recently established societies which we have mentioned. But even if we disregard the circumstantial evidence which proves the actual survival of Secret Germany, we must admit that a straight line can be detected between the Teutonic Order of the thirteenth century and the Germany of today. In this latter case we must assume that the Reichs-Landb und and the Herrenklub are the final source of all decisions because they would be the highest in the hierarchy of all existing Prusso-Teutonic organizations. They would thus have the final responsibility for Germany's present-day role. The facts set forth in this book support the former view.

The forces which in 1933 allowed Hitler's accession to power kept him there on condition that he serve their inter- ests, and that he systematically pursue their cherished plans of conquest.

We shall examine—see pages 261 ff.—the Greek foundations of Christian morality. The expression \"Christian\" has not necessarily a religious meaning.

We cannot enter here into the debate whether or not the same type of moral philosophy could have spread just as well by means other than the penetration of the Christian religions into different parts of the world. It is a fact, however, that the Christian religions served admirably to disseminate the sort of concept of life which is us ually considered essential to Western moral thought. It is cherished both by religious and a-religious thinkers. Our Morality and Theirs As for the expressions, moral and morality, we employ them in their broadest senses. We do not use them in connec- tion with the so-called \"moral code,\" a sort of narrow code supposed to specify day-by-day \"dos\" and \"don'ts\"; but rather to describe the basic principles regulating our entire lives. \"Morality,\" in this sense, is a sort of concept of life which permanently inspires our entire existence, including our politi- cal existence. *Of course the reader understands th at we do not include among modern social doctrines the Prusso-Teutonic a nd Nazi theories—which are definitely regression. 243"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"244 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY We are in the habit of constantly criticizing our everyday moral code (\"moral,\" in this case, in the narrower sense of the word). This criticism is useful in effecting a perpetual rejuve- nation of the petty rules regulating our lives. Such constant criticism does not, however, mean that we wish to change the basic principles. And it certainly does not mean that we wish to replace them with principles which are simply a return to the distant past. It is not within the scope of this book to examine whether or not our morality is higher than any other morality in gen- eral, or the Prusso-Teutonic morality in particular. Certain schools of thought oppose every attempt to differentiate as to the worth of competing moralities. We shall intentionally avoid this issue of the relative or non-relative worth of moral concepts. We shall, however, assume the risk of saying that most of us would not exchange our type of life for the primi- tive existence of our own ancestors in the Stone Ages or for the superstition-filled lives of so me of the savage tribes today in the middle of Africa. We take this position despite the feel- ing of insecurity created by the present turmoil—which occa- sionally prompts the easy comment that primitive peoples lead a happier and more desirable existence than ours. Such expressions of natural discourage ment cannot change the uni- versal and fundamental belief in progress. We shall content ourselves with a simplified standard of values for moral concepts. It evolves from the following trend of thought: Our primitive ancestors (just as primitive people today) had primitive ideas about the physical constitution of the world. Their eyes saw as far as ours but, because they had not yet related all their separate observations, their mental vision did not extend very far. This nearsightedness in laws of the physical world was accompanied by a nearsightedness in moral principles. It amounts to the same thing whether we"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"PRUSSIAN1SM AND DOWNWARD PROGRESSION 245 say that they had not yet obtained the necessary divine inspir- ation, or intuitive vision; or we might even say, pragmatically speaking, that they had not yet recognized the advantages in the long run of a certain mora l attitude over another more primitive one, which had been giving more immediate satis- faction to the egotistical instincts. There seems to be a paral- lel and uninterrupted progress in knowledge of the physical world and development of moral laws—uninterrupted except for temporary reversions which can be attributed to a sort of pendular movement. (We cannot examine here the role of defunct or dormant civilizations which at one time reached great moral heights, perhaps grea ter in certain respects than ours. It seems that profound intuitive insight into the do- main of moral truth has not always been accompanied by sufficient insight into physical cosmic truth. Consequently moral-philosophic thought necessari ly came to a dead-end and even deviated into superstitious aberrations—closely follow- ing the superstitious short cuts taken by these civilizations in the domain of cosmic truths. Th is disparity between physical and philosophical research may have been the actual cause of the disappearance or retrocession of these different civiliza- tions. It is quite po ssible that our own ci vilization is exposed to the same danger through a lack of balance in the opposite direction: i.e., if research in the field of moral philosophy is unable to keep pace with our rapid progress in scientific research.) For all practical purposes we can say that we prefer to let our lives be ruled by a moral philosophy evolving from a wide knowledge of physical phenom ena—a wider knowledge than that of our ancestors in so-called \"barbaric\" times. We feel fully justified in applying this latter simplified standard of values in choosing between competing moral concepts. On these terms we are in a position to state that such and such a moral concept is \"better\" (i.e., better for us) than"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"246 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY another—and consequently that we are willing to fight for the former. By stating, in this manner, a definite preference between different moral concepts, we can avoid subtle dis- cussion as regards the respective \"heights\" of these moralities. We shall have occasion later in this book to apply this simplified standard of values to the Prusso-Teutonic moral concept and to our Greco-Christian moral philosophy. We have already described in Chapters II—VII the historic back- ground of the Prusso-Teutonic stream of development. We shall now try to discover what was the original point of separ- ation between the two currents, the Prusso-Teutonic and the Greco-Christian. A brief study in this direction may confirm what we have said before: that it is fundamentally its departure from the Greco-Christian way of thin king and morality which makes the Prusso-Teutonic current so dangerous for the Western world. The Two Basic \"Progressions\" Most readers are familiar with the history of the first thou- sand years of the Christian era. The feudal organization which was established in Europe in Ca rolingian times has often been described. We review some of these details in the following pages simply because they have a definite bearing on matters discussed in this book. Barbar ian mentality, feudal system, Prusso-Teutonic conspiracy and contemporary Nazi ambi- tions on the one hand; Greek ci vilization, Roman legal school of thought, Judeo-Christian re ligions, humanitarian move- ments, modern social doctrines, and democratic traditions on the other hand, represent two different organic progressions moving in opposite directions. We shall call them the \"Down- ward Progression\" and the \"U pward Progression\" respec- tively. It is important to show all the relationships between the different phases within these two progressions."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"PRUSSIANISM AND DOWNWARD PROGRESSION 247 The Christian Empires of the Barbarians It is commonly recognized that Western civilization stems mainly from Greek and Judeo-Christian sources. It is true that in political customs, in particular, and in legal traditions the influence of ancient Rome is not negligible. When we want, however, to define the deeper layers of Western civilization, we think much more often of Athens than of the Romans. It is because of this greater depth that Greek traditions are assumed to be a more important influence in our lives. The teachings of Christ spread rapidly in the Western world during the first 1000 years A . D . It is useless to repeat here the details of this proc ess. The Roman Empire extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the lower Danube and Africa. The Christian religion took root within the different parts of the Empire. Then the Emperor himself, Constantine the Great, embraced it and contributed largely to the Christian- ization of his people. Severa l Christian Emperors followed and continued the process of cl osing down the Pagan temples. Emperor Theodosius the Great decided to divide the Em- pire between his two sons. This division was the origin of the two Christian Empires: the Ea stern Empire, extending over Ancient Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and Syria; and the Western Empire, including Ital y, Spain, Africa, Gaul and Britain. The Western Empire was soon overrun by different bar- baric peoples, several of whic h were Teutonic. The Vandals settled in Spain but were overcome by the Visigoths who established dominion over parts of Spain, Portugal and south- ern France. Into Italy came fi rst the Ostrogoths.

The powerful Franks established them- selves in the Rhine basin and penetrated into Gaul as far as"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"248 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY the Loire. Britain was overrun by the Angles, Saxons, and later by the Normans. The Western Emperors courted the various barbarian chiefs in a vain attempt to save their thrones. Toward the middle of the fifth century, Attila's Huns, forever on the move, plundered Gaul and Italy, and then the Vandals rav- aged Rome. The power of the Western Emperors had com- pletely disappeared. Their title had become meaningless and was finally dropped. Now began a remarkable spiritu al process among the bar- baric conquerors who had settled in different parts of Europe. The mystical power of the Christian religion—which had succeeded in a very short time in replacing the ancient Roman religion—extended to the barbarians as well. Enthusiastic missionaries were at work. All the different conquering tribes, including those of Teutonic origin, one after another became Christian: the Franks, the Alemanni, the Boiarians, the Thu- ringians. By the end of the eighth century, the Pope was in continual conflict with the Lombard Kings and the Roman nobles. Pepin the Short, King of the Fr anks, came to the aid of the Pope and vanquished the Lombards. The Pope thought that the Frankish rulers could be of lasting help to the Papacy. To increase the strength of these valuable allies and their prestige in the Christian West, he had an excellent idea: to bestow on them the crown of the former Western Roman Empire. The memory of the Roman Empire was still alive in the West, although the Empire had actually continued to exist only in the East (as the Eastern or Greek Empire). In 800 the Pope placed the crown on the head of Charle- magne—or Karl the Great—son of Pepin. The Carolingian Empire, a revival of the ancient Western Empire, was born— this time an Empire under Germanic leadership, but of Christian faith like the earlier one. The establishment of the Western Empire under a German"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"PRUSSIANISM AND DOWNWARD PROGRESSION 249 Emperor was the culminating point in the conversion to Christianity of the different German tribes. The East Roman Empire was falling into ruin and was no longer in a position to be the shield of Christendom against Islam. The fresh ardor of the recently converted German nations was welcome support to the Church. Furthermore, Charlemagne united under his sceptre the greater part of both the Latin and Germanic nations. His Empire consequently became a very active center of crystallizati on for what was to be known later on as the Western civilization of Christian essence. In the beginning the recons tituted Roman Empire was a valuable aid to the papacy. Af ter Charlemagne's death, how- ever, great disorder followed. The Empire soon fell to pieces. Otto of Saxony, who was chosen King by the German princes, reestablished the Empire in 961 under the name \"Holy Roman Empire.\" He organized it in the Carolingian spirit. Otto's \"Saxon\" house, later the so-cal led Franconian House, and finally the Hohenstaufen fami ly thus carried forward the tradition of a \"Roman\" Em pire under German rule. Whether these latter houses actually descended from the Carolingian line or not is immaterial. They can certainly be called Carolingians since they perpetuated the Carolingian ambitions. They all claimed descent from Emperor Arnulf— himself a direct descendant of Charlemagne. According to this version—which has not been hi storically subs tantiated—the mothers of Conrad I of the Franconian House, and Henry I of the Saxon House were both daughters of Arnulf. The grandmother of the Hohenstaufen Frederick I (Frederick Barbarossa) came from the Saxon imperial house. In a very broad sense the Saxon, Franconian and Hohenstaufen Em- perors can consequently be called Carolingians. In the course of centuries, th e imperial ambitions took on a shape more and more different from what they were under Charlemagne. The accent was no longer on cooperation with the Church, but on domination of it."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"250 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY So long as the Papacy was willing to take orders from the Emperors there was no conflict between the two powers. New Popes came. They burned with great inner fire and no longer were disposed to subordi nate themselves to the Em- perors whom the Papacy had helped to power. We have briefly recounted (see pages 31-32) the long-enduring con- flict between the Popes and the Emperors. It reached its climax under Frederick Barbarossa and his grandson, Fred- erick II. This conflict caused the departure of the Hohenstaufen Emperors from their original Ch ristian principles. It trans- formed Frederick II into \"Hammer of the World.\" The Emperors liked to appear in the role of faithful but disap- pointed sons of the Church: ha ving met at Rome a different reception from what they had imagined, they nursed their grudge against Christianity itself. It is true that the Hohenstaufen Emperors had imagined something quite different from what they could possibly have expected. Their imaginations had run away with them. The original pact between the Frankish rulers and the Papacy provided for mutual protection. The Pope placed the crown of the Roman Empire on the head of Charlemagne to give him more prestige in the eyes of the people he had brought under his sceptre, so that he would be better able to protect the Papacy. The reconstkution of the Roman Empire did not, however, imply that the Emperors had been assigned the mis- sion of conquering the world and becoming its supreme ruler —dominus mundi—as the Hohenstaufens imagined. Nor did it imply giving to the Emperors a power superior to that of the Pope in all matters, even in things spiritual. Emperor Henry III of the Franconian line—from whom the Hohenstaufens were desce nded through maternal lineage —went so far as to name Popes.

Feudalism: Barbarism U nder a Christian Cloak The very creation of the feudal system was an attempt of barbaric customs to survive under a Christian cloak. It was possible for this system to evolve in the recently Christianized Kingdom of the Franks, and to spread from there throughout the Empire only because neithe r the Emperor nor the nobles took the real meaning of Chri stianity very seriously. The feudal system crystalli zed and developed numerous inequalities and privileges. Mere possession of riches and force gave definite rights—for exampl e, that of conducting private wars, in which force alone wa s decisive. The complicated tangle of the rights and powers of thousands of petty sov- ereigns and holders of fiefs created innumerable injustices. Slavery was being combated by the Church and gradually disappeared—but the system of serfage which developed under the feudal regime was not much better. The only dif- ference between slaves and serfs was that the latter were attached to the soil. The rapid establishment of the feudal regime in Carolingian times was fundamentally an attempt to nullify the teachings of the Church in the social field by those who feared them. To us it appears as a sort of indirect reaction of barbarism against Christianity. Greek society had contained the elements from which our modern democra tic ideas evolved. The same elements were also present to a certain extent in Roman society. Feudal society represented a definite regression from the standards of these two societies. In the spiritual field Christia nity meant the continuance and development of certain Greek idea s.

In the social field, on the co ntrary, feudalis m was organized according to old barbaric principles, although hidden under the cloak of Christianity. Social development thus represented a regression back to times preceding the civilizations of Greece and Rome. Consequently the spiritual deve lopment, which can be con- sidered as a definite step forwar d, took place in spite of the emergence of feudalism. This paradoxical state of affairs— progress in things spiritual a nd regression in social matters— characterized the Middle Ages. Greek moral concepts and Ro man law faded into greater and greater oblivion. Feudal law and morality sprang from barbarian concepts. The feudal fief was simply an outgrowth of the homestead of the barbarians. Thousands of powerful warriors set up their own particular little realms and protected them by force. The mass of the people who were subjected to their will were the serfs a nd the villains. The serfs were bound to the soil. Their condition differed only slightly from that of the slaves whom they replaced. The villains—villagers —were originally a grade higher. They paid rent for the soil on which they toiled. The distinction between the two classes tended to disappear. Both had to submit to the will of their lord. Without his permission they could not marry, nor change habitation, nor bequeat h their goods. He was their judge in all matters—he protec ted them against neighboring plunderers and himself plundere d them at will. No law de- cided their quarrels—only the suzerain's pleasure. He set the amount of the taxes which were to be paid to him in products of the soil. He subjected their daughters to the jus primae noctis, if it so pleased him. But the suzerains, unless they were among the most power- ful, had to submit in turn to suzerains higher than themselves."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"PRUSSIANISM AND DOWNWARD PROGRESSION 253 The great majority of the suzerains were thus at the same time both lords and vassals. Fealty of one to another was based on the use of land and was not a personal matter. Certain barons might be vassals of different su zerains because certain of their holdings carried with them allegi ance to different lords. Occa- sionally the various lords to whom the same baron owed fealty engaged in wars among themselves and this created endless complications. The vassal owed his sovereign military service, help in the administration of justice, and financial help on certain occasions. If the vassal died without heirs the fief reverted to the lord. Castles and fortresses were er ected not for the State but to protect the property of the lords and to facilitate plunder of surrounding lands. In case of dispute the barons could ask to be tried by their peers—that is, by vassals on the same level. In practice they took justice into their own hands. This re- sulted in so-called \"private wars ,\" and personal disputes were decided by duels. Power and not law determined all matters. Christian Reign or Imperial World Domination Imperial power in the so-called Holy Roman Empire flowed down through the complex ties linking princes and barons, all—in principle—owi ng allegiance to the Emperor. It seemed to be definitely in the Emperor's interest to include the clergy as an integral part of the feudal system. For them this was a means of insuring the submission of the Church to their own power. The manoeuvre was clever: the bishoprics were made secular fiefs and th e bishops were invested with rights over vassals and serfs. Th e bishops were gradually be- coming secular princes, living in the same wolfish atmosphere as the feudal lords in general.

A flourishing trade developed in these titles, although this was c onsidered scandalous by many good souls devoted to the interests of the Church. A clergy organized according to such principles acts in accordance with worldly and not spiritual considerations. Its first allegiance necessarily goes to the Emperor, from whom it derives, in the last analysis, all its privileges—and it does not go to the Pope. Christianity was thus in danger of becoming a limited, provincial affair, serving the interests of the Emperor. The Popes recognized the danger in time. Pope Nicholas II reserved to the Cardinals the right to elect the Popes. Gregory VII abolished the arbitrary choice of bishops and provided for filling of ecclesiastical offi ces by the clergy. The bishops convoked synods to re-establish unity among the clergy. The Pope also reminded the Emperor that all the latter's power came from the Papacy, that he was crowned by the Pope, and that his oath called for obedience to the Pope and the Church. Gregory intended to insist on this obedience—which had been purely nominal under former Popes. All attempts of the Popes to re-establish the rights of the Church and to limit those of the Emperor necessarily led to conflicts with the latter. We have spoken of the struggles of the Papacy with Henry IV, which were followed by the humiliation of the Emperor at Canossa; of the investiture of an Anti-Pope, and the events preceding the first Crusade; and of the Hohenstaufens' diffi culties with the Popes which had a direct bearing on the ma tters discussed in this book. All these conflicts arose out of a fundamental divergence between two diametrically opposed goals: that of the Popes, aiming at the spiritual reign of Christianity; and that of the Emperors, directed at material world domination.

The former felt that its existence was endangered by the moral te achings of Christianity and reconstituted its way of life under the feudal cloak. It was a measure of protection against the revolutionary social and economic influence of Christianity. It is true that feudal society changed for the better in the course of centuries, but this happened in spire of its funda- mental concepts and almost solely because of the influence of Christian teachings. A civilization whose social structure is based on one sort of morality, but whose members, in their religious life, are taught a morality of quite a different sort, will sooner or later necessarily have to choose between the two.

By \"strictly religious domain\" is meant such doc- trines as those concerning the Holy Trinity, the birth and death of Christ, etc. On the other hand, Christianity has within its \"moral content\" doc trines of universal love and such teachings as those contained in the greater part of the Ten Commandments. The interdiction against worship of alien gods comes under the first—th e \"strictly religious\" class. People must have felt that the moral truth of Christianity insures a much more satisfactory, happier way of life than feudalism offered. This is th e reason why they gradually replaced feudal morality with anot her of Christian inspiration. The Church was not in a position to proceed too quickly. A first attempt by the Popes at the pacification of Europe— the so-called \"Peace of God\"—completely failed. The Popes declared priests, monks, nuns, shepherds, travellers, school- children and tradesmen inviolate. Asylums were created. But nobody respected them and the Peace of God was eventually forgotten. The next, more modest attempt to civilize the feudal jungle was the \"Truce of God.\" By this compromise the Popes tried to create a peaceful state of affairs at least from vespers on Wednesday until sunrise on Monda y. During this time every- one was forbidden to assault, rob or kill; or to attack or seize castles or other properties. Those who violated the Truce of God were exiled and excommunicated. The Church did not rely alone on the inner truths of Christian moral teachings. It deemed it useful at all time s to back up these inner truths by sanctions—spiritual sanctions with material consequences.

The Magna Carta itself was written under the stimulus of a Christian way of thinking. Th e English barons who obtained it from the King declared themselves to be an \"Army of God and the Holy Church.\" Christian moral teachings had by this time (1215)* taken deep root in England. The Charter was a move toward the liberation of English society from the excessive feudal power of the King. But it was only a very modest liberation from the feudal yoke. It was not yet an attack on the fundamentals of feudal society. Its main achievement was the securing of certain guarantees of liberty—but only for freemen, not for serfs and slaves. It assured to the individual—so long as he was a free man— protection in accordance with the Christian concept of the primacy of the human soul. It introduced concepts which had not been known in feudal soci ety but which were close to old Roman and Greek concepts. Such concepts, once stated, transcended their original purpose. During the centuries they had an influence toward reform far beyond the granting of specific rights to freemen in 1215. The Logical Plan for World Conquest The Hohenstaufen imperial po wer derived its strength from feudal concepts. The Empire was a sort of super-suzerainty. It was governed by the same principles of utter disregard for the rights of its vassals as thos e vassals themselves displayed toward their own vassals and serfs.

Only by virtue of this asset—the divine and miraculous nature of their a ppointment—were they able to maintain their position above a ll the other princes and barons. The very title \"Holy Roman Emperor\" was based on two intangible elements which appealed deeply, even mystically, to the masses of the people: first, holiness; and second, the somewhat vague descent from the Roman Empire. So long as the Emperors were sure of the help of the Church, they could nurture the most ambitious projects, based on accepted feudal traditions. The small suzerains were not contented until they had conque red and plundered all neigh- boring lands and the Emperor would not be contented until he had conquered and plundered the whole globe. His world- embracing imperial ambitions evolved logically from this feudal type of thought. They were the normal ambition which befitted a super-suzerain. The valuable mystical aid of the Church was available to the Emperors so long as they were on good terms with the Papacy—and they were on good te rms, as we have seen, so long as clergy and Papacy were willing to take orders from the Emperors. When they refused, the whole structure was upset. The law of might now favored the vassals and worked to the disadvantage of the Emperor. So long as the Emperors had been backed by the mystical influence of the Church, they had had at their disposal the collective power of their vassals.

We might assume that this moral content came simply through revelation of divine truth. Or we might say that it stems from Judaea and Greece. The latter double origin is generally accepted and we speak alter- nately about Judeo-Christian and Greco-Christian concepts. There is an evident relationship between the Jewish and the Christian religions. The moral laws of the Old Testament, including the Ten Commandments of Moses, passed into the Christian teachings but they were enriched there (we are tempted to say \"humanized\"). It is not possible to discuss here fully the controversial question as to which elements contributed to the formation of Christianity.

T. Stace, in a brilliantly written book,* makes a com- parison between the Western way of thinking and the totali- tarian Weltanschauung. He also uses the expression \"Greco- Christian\" to describe our ci vilization and our morality; but for him the contribution of Greece to our way of thinking goes back to the Greek philosophers and to Plato in particular. Stace says: \"The spiritual forces which, have molded the West are Christianity and Greek philosophy.\" There is no argument against the influence of Greek philos- ophers on Western philosophical thought. We believe, how- ever, that, so far as morality is concerned, developments in the philosophical domain have, on mo rality, a more limited, more indirect effect, than religion. Plato and other Greek philoso- phers have, of course, had some influence on Western moral- ity. The real Greek influence within the Greco-Christian morality was, however, of a quite different nature. It did not stem from philosophical roots but from religious or rather from mystical ones.** The Greco-Christian ethos was not born of Greek rational thought on the one side and the Christian religion of mystical essence on the other. A marriage of such disparate elements would never have given the las ting results with which we are familiar. Mystical religious teachings (Christianity) and ra- tional philosophical deductions (Plato) do not mix so well that they could have created a civilization and a morality— both of which have lasted for so many centuries. * W. T. Stace, The Destiny of Western Man, New York, Reynal & Hitchcock, 1942. ** We disagree with Stace on a furthe r point. He attributes to German philosophers (Schopenhauer and Nietzsche) a decisive part in the formation of German totalitarian th eories. In our opinion, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche merely crystallized—with personal varia tions corresponding to the individu- ality of each—certain thoughts which stemmed from much deeper sources in Prusso-Teutonia. These thoughts had a more earthly basis than sheer philosophy. Aside from our disagreemen t with the importance Stace attrib- utes to purely philosophic factors in the formation both of the Western and \"German-totalitarian\" (for us, \"Prusso-Teu tonic\") concepts of life, we find much merit in his actual detailed juxtaposition of the two concepts."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 263 The Great Influence of the \"Initiation\" Any lengthy discussion attempting to prove the last thesis would exceed the limits of th is book. We shall, however, try to show what we mean by the mystical (as contrasted to the philosophical) Greek influence on Greco-Christian morality and civilization. When we think of Greek religi on we usually have in mind the Greek gods described by Homer in the Iliad and Odys- sey and by Hesiod. It is difficult to establish the contribu- tions, respectively, of popular an d poetic creation in the con- cepts of the Homeric gods. Yet there is something non- mystical and earthy about th em—something \"transparent.\" But these charmingly simple Homeric gods do not represent the entirety of Greek religious life. Mysteries of a secret, esoteric nature existed in addition to the popular mythology of the Greeks. Mysteries into which only the initiate were admitted flourished all over the ancient world. In Greece the \"Eleusin- ian Mysteries'\" were predominant. Celebrated in Eleusis, near Athens, they were devoted chie fly to Dionysos and Demeter, a god and goddess mentioned but rarely by Homer. Similar mysteries, all related to Eleusis, were celebrated in other places throughout Greece and later even in Rome. These mysteries molded Greek thinking and morality to a much greater extent than the teachings of the philoso- phers, or the moral concepts deriving from the Homeric theogony. Exactly to what exte nt cannot be examined here in detail. We do not deny that there wa s a definite connection be- tween these mysteries and the philosophical theories. This connection existed, however, onl y to the extent to which philosophers expressed in conc ise, exoteric* form certain veiled esoteric teachings of the mysteries. Plato himself seems * See page 266."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"264 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY to have been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries. He men- tions them several times with reverence, and his teachings appear in many ways to have been inspired by them. Also he introduces his Socrates as an initiate of Eleusis. The origin of these Mysteries has been ascribed to several sources. Those which are the most commonly mentioned are (1) Egypt; (2) Orpheus and the Orphic school; (3) Various ancient mysteries of the original inhabitants of Greece dating from pre-Hellenic times. It is interesting to note that the Orphic source itself seems to go back, according to certain versions, to Egypt. Indeed it has been said that Orpheus, legendary King of Thrace, went to Egypt and was there initi- ated into the Egyptian mysteries. Certain Greek authors believe that it was Orpheus who founded the Mysteries of Eleusis. The followers of Orpheus, members of the Orphic Brother- hood, believed in the \"Orphic Life.\" The latter included a great number of ascetic rules— among others, the ban against animal food. Several other brothe rhoods of this sort existed in Greece. The Pythagoreans were among the most famous and have also been associated by various authors with the Mys- teries. According to Herodotus , both the Orphic and Pythag- orean teachings came from Egypt. All these secret religious and semi-religious activities seem to have had a very great effect on what we mean by Greek civilization. It is the influence of these various brotherhoods, mysteries, teletes, etc., whic h, through numerous channels, was transmitted to Western civilization. It is here, much more than in the commonly known Homeric mythology, that we can trace the actual Greek influence on the Greco-Christian way of life and on Christianity itself. This was an extremely rich heritage indeed. Its transmission to Western civilization through the ages followed devious and complicated routes: besides the direct filiation of ideas through the official Christian channel, there were several side-"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 265 routes. The various \"heretical teachings\" of the beginnings of the Christian era originated from closely related sources. All these intermingled or parallel movements seem to have carried forward elements springing from the same initiations, which date back to the Greek mysteries and possibly to Egypt. Their influence on Western civilization is as great as the influence of Christianity itself and should not be over- looked. The Eleusinian rites shaped to a very great extent the souls of those who were initiated into the Mysteries. The symbolic value of the revelations contained in the Eleusinian Seven Degrees was such that it contributed to the spiritual development of the individual s who participated in them. Of course only a few were admitted to the privileges of the full initiation, but even the lower degrees imparted precious teachings in veiled symbolic form. The successive initiations constituted a most exceptional schooling in the direction of spiritual and moral elevation—even when judged by our pres- ent standards. The secret about the content of the Mysteries was very carefully guarded and those who committed indiscretions concerning them risked the death penalty. Alcibiades was once accused, just be fore leaving for battle at the head of the armies of Athens, of having profaned the Eleusinian Mys- teries. Although he flatly denied ever having done anything of the sort, he found it extremely difficult to justify himself, and his departure for the campaign was considerably delayed. When attempts are made to define the Greek influence on our civilization, Plato and the other Greek philosophers are mentioned much more frequently than these Mysteries. The reason for this is that all our thinking is geared to a concept which grants credit for our progress only to factors popularly revealed and openly discussed—and not to anything as incom- prehensible and secret as the content of these Mysteries.

In reality nothing made a gr eater contribution to Greek moral thought than these Mysteries, although they often ap- pear obscure to us. Their teachings penetrated to the widest circles of the population, whereas the theories of the philoso- phers reached only the learned. But in spite of the popular acceptance of the Mysteries, the philosophers did not look down upon them. Rather they considered them extremely respectable institutions, containing, especially in their more elevated degrees, great inspiration even for themselves. It is true that the belief in \"reason\" stemmed from the Greek philosophers; but for thes e men the initiative domain and its symbolic teachings always had great force and validity. Western civilization, with its uncompromising rationalism, has always refused to believe in anything that was beyond pure reason—except when it came to the strictly religious domain. But religion, the purely mystical content of religion, is for us today entirely separa te from science and philosophy. For the Greeks, science and ph ilosophy were closely con- nected with the Mysteries. We cannot discuss here whether the modern attitude in these matters is good or bad. In any event it is completely different from that of the Greeks who were in the habit of tapping mystical sources and deriving from them teachings which they then used in the field of pure reason. The Greek Mysteries and the Mysteries of other peoples of ancient times were esoteric—i.e., they revealed their teachings only to the initiate through pr ogressive initiations. Most ancient Eastern religions had in addition to the esoteric por- tion of their teachings, an exoteric part as well (i.e., simplified teachings for the non-initiate).

(The Christian baptism and the Jewish circumcision of the men are actual initiation cere- monies.) These modern religions, at the time of their founding, severed relations with any livi ng esoterism—or rather they incorporated into the symbolic contents of their basic books, which are available to everyone, the esoteric teachings which lay behind them. These were to remain a lasting inspiration to the faithful. They lacked, however, progressive initiations, and consequently progressive profundities of thought, among which even the superior and most demanding individuals might have found a level to satisfy them. This is perhaps the reason why modern science and philosophy evolved—except in a few cases—along lines entirely independent of those of religion. The secrecy concerning the Mysteries was justified in the following manner by the ancient Greeks: Truth is of divine origin and is revealed only to the few who make the necessary effort to get close to it. It should, consequently, not be communi cated to those who are not desirous of exerting these efforts. The Mysteries, which raise obstacles in the way of the successive initiations, com- municate the truth only to people who are willing to work for it. It would be dangerous to reveal the truth to those who are not prepared and not ripe for it: having received the truth with no effort they would nor a ppreciate it and might misuse it. The Beginning of the \"Life Without Thorns\" In spite of the secrecy which surrounded the Eleusinian Mysteries different fragments have come out through the works of various Greek and Latin writers. Modern writers (Martin N. Nilsson and Victor Magnien, among others) have succeeded in piecing together these fragments and in giving a"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"268 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY fairly accurate idea of the principal phases of the different initiations. We are interested here only in certain Eleusinian teachings which appear to us to have a direct bearing on moral concepts and which may have influenced Greco-Christian thinking in moral matters. We have said that Demeter, goddess of agriculture, was the principal figure at Eleusis along with Dionysos. Demeter gave two things to mankind: agriculture and the Eleusinian Mys- teries. \"We have received from Demeter two gifts,\" says Isocrates, \"the fruits of the earth which have permitted us to live a life superior to that of the animals—and the initiation.\" Magnien says, \"As soon as men have agriculture they can live a much easier life without fighting and killing each other. Consequently the Mysteries, by teaching agriculture, bring forth civilization.\"* We may add that the Mysteries not only taught agriculture but inculcated in the initiates the deep spiritual meaning of the possession of agriculture—the se nse to which Magnien refers: i.e., an appreciation of the uselessness in the future for men to fight and kill each other. The Mysteries became an excep- tional school for elevating man toward higher goals not only in his rational thought but also in his basic instincts. It would indeed have been simple to preach on every street corner that now that they possessed the techniques of agri- culture, it was much better for men to employ cooperation and exchange than the wolf-like methods to which humanity had been accustomed. Perhaps such utilitarian moral argu- ments would have appealed to the reason of some people and might have had a limited effect on them. These arguments, however, would not have reached the instinctive part of man —which, at that time, was still completely geared to barbarian modes of living: killing, robbing, and, in general, achieving success in life by methods of force. * Victor Magnien, Les Mysteres d'Eleusis, Paris, 1929."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 269 These deeply rooted instincts could not have been affected by any rational argument—but the methods of the Mysteries, directed toward much deeper levels of the mind, were won- derfully suited to the accomplishment of this work. The profoundly meaningful symbols, pr ogressively revealed to the initiates in the Mysteries; the elaborate ceremonies which appealed to all senses; and the music which accompanied the rites reached the most hidden recesses of the soul, well beyond the realm of pure reason. Thus the Mysteries prepared the way for a change on these mental levels without which any moral reform would have been superficial. Man's barbarian instincts had been kept alive not only by the daily experience of a life of savagery, but also by very ancient mysteries which were based on the sacrifice of humans. A further important func tion of the Eleusinian Mys- teries—and of other, less impor tant mysteries of the same category—was to replace the older mysteries and to substi- tute their own higher ideas of divine happiness for the orig- inally barbarian concepts of the latter. The expression, \"Ground life\" (\"ground\" from the verb \"to grind\") was used in the Mysteries to describe the civil- ized life which man can have through the use of agricul- ture. The use of wine was also considered by the Greeks to have a civilizing effe ct. Wine was believed to be purifying, and the symbolic representation of its invention by Dionysos is also part of the Mysteries. We can assume that symbolically wine replaced the human blood drunk in the earlier sacrificial mysteries, just as the use of the products of agriculture re- placed the eating of human flesh. Another expression used in the Mysteries, \"No more thorns,\" conveys the same idea as \"Ground life.\" The in- vention of agriculture meant the overnight transformation of the soil—which had formerly been only a hunting ground, full of thorns and prickles—into rich and smiling fields and or- chards.

It is expr essed by the formula, 'sharing and not strangling.' \"* The Splitting Point of the Two Concepts of Life All these teachings are describe d in small portions by vari- ous authors. In the Mysteries themselves they were clad in numerous symbols, some clear an d limpid, like those Himerius mentions in one of his speeches: \"The Attic law obliges the mystes [the initiates of the Mysteries] to bring to Eleusis a light and stalks of grain, symbols of civilized life.\"* Other symbols, on the other hand, were less transparent but all could be similarly interpreted. We enter into all these details only because we believe it useful to find out through what processes, through what insight into the nature of things Western civilization really started—this in order to understand better the split between the Prusso-Teutonic and Greco-Christian approaches to life. We do not expect to outline a full and comprehensive answer to this question, which is immense in scope. We be- lieve, however, that the few items cited from the Mysteries of Eleusis provide at least a simplified answer to our question. The importance of a Greek contribution to Western civilization is not generally doubted. As a matter of fact, a great number of Greek authors themselves credit the teach- ings of the Mysteries with ha ving \"brought forth civilization.\" The writer feels that so far as Greek thought has influenced Western thought in general, we must attribute this contribu- * Quotations from Victor Magni en, Les Mysteres d'Eleusis."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 271 tion to the \"discovery\" of a better, higher way of life—and this discovery definitely came from the symbolic Eleusinian teachings we have briefly discussed. If this is so, we can see the point at which \"civilized\" moral concepts, in the Western sense, originally stemmed away from wolf-like moral concepts. And the latter are the same con- cepts ivhich down to the present have characterized Prusso- Teutonic thinking. It is, of course, impossible to a ssign a definite period to the processes to which we refer. However, the determination of such a time has much less importance than insight into the processes themselves. There was a time when humanity could think only in terms of killing, plundering, and imposing the law of the strongest. This was a harsh pe riod, a strenuous period for everyone—for the \"wolves\" themselves. Then sometime, somewhere, humanity developed a great new idea: the idea of cooperation through friendly exchange of the products of the soil. This discovery opened the door to a happier, easier life. It meant so amazing, so radical a de- parture from the earlier concepts of mankind that those who had made it did not dare to speak about it to the masses. Thus it became part of the Mysteries—and was imparted, with elaborate precautions, to the initiates only. In the course of centuries, however, this discovery spread from the Mysteries to a great part of humanity—but another part never grasped its meaning. The latter remained at the level of the previous barbarous concept of life—the \"life of thorns\"—a sort of concept so deeply ingrained as to be almost instinctive. Only initiation into the higher way of life would have had the power of altering c oncepts so rooted in the mind.

Among them, the Prusso-Teutonics are the representatives par excellence, for the reasons examined, of the Downward Progression. The Prusso-Teutonics can therefore be considered non-initiates— nurtured on a long-outdated philosophy of life. The rest of humanity, with a few exceptions, benefited directly or indirectly by the initiation into higher truth. (In the same sense as our descripti on of Christianity and Judaism as mass initiations.)

This also was an \"eye-opening\" process. The three dimensions had always been present; but man's reason and—even more important—his instincts were, unt il some unspecified pre- historic time, not yet devel oped enough to understand and grasp what three dimensions really meant. (Today—given sufficient mathematical knowle dge—we can comprehend Ein- stein's four-dimensional world rationally. To our instincts, however, this world is still terra incognita.) Similarly, on the moral level, the possibility of a \"ground\" life was always present—even when all peoples still lived the \"life with thorns\"—but nobody had yet grasped it. We know that, in the physical world, animals whose per- ception is limited to one and two dimensions have survived to our own day. They have not, even yet, passed through the sort of \"initiation\" which would enable them to understand what three dimensions mean.

The Egyptian Sources of the Greek Mysteries The discovery of a \"higher moral truth\"—which is at the basis of Western civilization a nd which was contained in the Mysteries of Elcusis—did not ne cessarily originate in these Mysteries.

Here, of course, we enter a field where precise investigation and definite conclusions beco me more and more difficult. Herodotus says that Demeter co rresponds to Isis, and Diony- sos to Osiris in the Egyptian mysteries. This comparison has been generally admitted. Herodotus also declares that the Eleusinian Mysteries derived the belief in the immortality of the human soul from Egypt. We have examined before the connections with Egypt of the possible Orphic and Pythag- orean contributions to the Eleusinian Mysteries. All these spiritual affiliations make it appear quite possible that if we could retrace the road of the Greek mysteries to their original sources we would find ourselves in Egypt. The only other sources of the Greek mysteries which have been mentioned occasionally are the mysteries which existed in Greece in pre-Hellenic times. It is, however, possible that many of the latter mysteries were simply of the blood sacri- ficial type, containing teachi ngs which, in spite of their sacred or initiative nature, might be called \"barbarous.\" If so, before making their contribution to the Greek mysteries, the whole direction of these ancien t mysteries must have been altered toward the \"upward progression\"—perhaps at the time when they came into contact w ith the Egyptian mystic ideas. But we know very little about these pre-Hellenic mysteries. It is, of course possible that some of them may have moved into the camp of the \"upward progression\" long before this time. If we assume the Egyptian origin of the Greek mysteries,— as do several authors both ancient and modern—we may just as well go farther back and consider the possibility of a filiation from India. There are, indeed, many analogies be- tween the Greek and Egyptian mysteries and certain East Indian teachings. We cannot hope to get anywhere—and we shall not attempt to—on the ex tremely uncertain ground of this time-honored discussion: which came earlier, and which"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 275 influenced the other—the Indian or the Egyptian civilization? But whether we admit the primacy of Egypt or India we can clearly see the same elements in the mystical teachings of Egypt, India and Greece—all directed toward our upward progression. Thus Western civi lization and the various East- ern traditions all s eem to belong to the same progression. The role of the discovery of agriculture in the Greek mys- teries, as the basis of certain moral teachings, was more or less foreshadowed in the Egyptian mysteries. We have mentioned the comparison made by Herodotus between the Greek and Egyptian gods: Demeter and Dionysos on the one hand and Isis and Osiris on the other. This comparison likewise applies to the deduction of a morality from agriculture: Isis has a significance in many respects similar to that of Demeter, and to that of Dionysos—with the difference that in the Egyptian mysteries certain agricultural discoveries seem to be directly related to the fertilizing value of the Nile, a river correspond- ing symbolically to Osiris. \"The concrete Egyptian imagination also ascribes to Osiris and Isis the introduction of agriculture, the invention of the plow, the hoe, etc.; for Osiris gi ves not only the useful itself— the fertility of the earth—but moreover the means of making use of it. He also gi ves men laws, a civil order, and a religious ritual; he thus places in men' s hands the means of labor and secures its result. Osiris is also the symbol of the seed which is placed in the earth, and then springs up—as also of the cause of life. Thus we find this heterogeneous duality—the phe- nomena of nature and the spiritual—woven together into one knot.\" (Hegel—The Philosophy of History.*) Thus the Egyptian mysteries—before the Greek mysteries —seem to have presented the moral laws as deriving from the discovery of agriculture.

To credit him simply with the introduction of wine is to diminish his real importance considerably. Beyond the field of utilitarian deduction of a morality* we can discover a higher, more spiritual field of moral inspiration in the same mysteries. This is a domain where the immortality of the human soul and metempsy chosis are major factors. Our soul is regarded as being of divine essence. In the higher degrees of the Eleusinian initiation the polytheistic concep- tion of the exoteric religion gradually disappears. The Soul merges with the One and forms, in the highest—or seventh— degree of Initiation but one divi ne unity. Thus in their ulti- mate, although secret expressi on, the Mysteries definitely reach a monotheistic state. \". . .

The Iarter has among its basic concepts \"the infinite value of the human individual\" —related by Hegel to Egypt although it came to us more directly from Greece, in particular through the Eleusinian Mysteries. The moral conclusions deriving from this conception are the same as those drawn through the \"agricultural\" or utili- tarian deduction.

The concepts of sympathy and love of our fellow crea- tures, which are commonly regarded as Christian concepts, are contained either actually or virtually in the Mysteries. There are but few details availa ble about the initiation to the \"mystical\" (or \"philosophical\") love which was part of the fifth, or sacerdotal, degree in the Eleusinian Mysteries. The exact nature of this \"a-physical love\" aroused much discus- sion from time to time and various interpretations circulated. It is probable that the real m eaning of the Fifth Initiation of the Eleusinian Mysteries approximated present concepts of Christian love. Consequently, in the last anal ysis, the two types of moral deductions in the Mysteries give the same results. We en- counter here one of those strange \"superpositions\"—charac- teristic of the ancient mysterie s—of identical truths derived in different manners and from different symbols which even- tually fade into one. It is commonly believed that the monotheistic concept started with the Jewish and Christian religions. However, it appears probable that monothe ism was already fully devel- oped in the ancient Mysteries—but it was part of the highest initiations only and carefully hidden from the masses of the followers. These subtle concepts—that God is The One and that the human soul has evolved from the same essence—were ex- tremely novel compared to earlier concepts. It is not surpris- ing that they have been considered \"dangerous\" for the com- mon people—more dangerous even than the meaning of agri- culture which we mentioned before.

The concepts of sympathy and brotherly—or mystical—love were not com- municated to the masses for the same reason. The Egyptian Sources of the Jewish Religion As pointed out above, it is pr obably true that the esoteric concept of a unique god existed both in the highest Egyptian and Greek mysteries. It is also probable—this view is based on the many references by Greek authors to Egyptian sources of the Greek mysteries—that the concept in question was passed on from Egypt to Greece. From these assumptions we may reach a third: that this concept of the Egyptian mysteries may have been at the origin of the Jewish monotheistic doc- trines. The hypothesis that the Jewish religion may be of Egyptian origin was advanced by Freud in his Moses. According to Freud, Moses was an Egyptian who became a believer in a short-lived Egyptian religion, called the \"Aton-religion.\" \"Aton\" was a monotheistic god proclaimed by a Pharaoh who called himself \"Akhnaton.\" Hi s original name was Ame- nophis, but he assumed the name \"Akhnaton\" in honor of his god, Aton. The abstract, non-anthropomorphic Aton was opposed by Akhnaton to the polytheistic doctrines pro- claimed by the priests. A. Weigall* states concerning this: \"Akhnaton did not permit any graven image to be made of the Aton. The True God, said the King, had no form; and he held this opinion throughout his life.\" There is remarkable similarity between Akhnaton's and the Jewish ban on graven images of God, and also between the respective concepts upon which these interdictions were based. Furthermore, the name \"A ton\" is very close to \"Ado- * A.

But it must be added that no historic facts can be found to prove that Moses was really a disciple of Akhnaton's doc- trines, as Freud believes, or that he actually taught these doc- trines to the Jews. Whether the teachings Moses brought to the Jews were directly influenced by the doctrines of Akhnaton is of but small importance. He may have known the Aton concept of God from other sources. Akhnaton himself did not create his god, Aton; he simply tried to impose on his people the spir- itual reign of this god in place of the earlier primitive doc- trines. After Akhnaton's death, Aton again disappeared from the foreground, and the priests reestablished the older and more primitive religious teachings. What had happened was probably this: Aton was not one of the gods of the common, popular theogony of Egypt. On the contrary he corresponded to the more subtle concept of a monotheistic divinity as it existed in the highest degrees of the Egyptian mysteries. In one word he was an esoteric and not an exoteric god. Akhnaton was certainly an initiate, because in the ancient mysteries royal dignity was always connected with a certain high degree of initiation. (In Greece, for example, the sixth degree of the Eleusinian Mysteries—among seven—represented the royal initiation.) Akhnaton must have been moved by the impatience and the feeling of revolt of a man who refuses to preach one thing to his people while be- lieving in another. For this reas on he decided to break the laws of secrecy of his initiation and to tell the people that \"There is no other god but Aton.'\" The priests who opposed him did not disagree with him on grounds of doctrine—they believed in Aton as much as Akh- naton did, but they would not re veal their belief outside the mysteries. They opposed the Ki ng because they were shocked by his indiscretion.

All great founders of popular religions appear to have been moved by the same feelings as Akhnaton: they burn with their impatience to reveal to everybody immediately what the contemporary initiates believe ought to be imparted slowly and only by progressive initiation. Moses acted just as Akhnaton had. He had the same impa- tience as the King to reveal certain teachings in which he believed. These teachings were, indeed, very close to those which Akhnaton taught—but this does not mean by any means that Moses should be consid ered a disciple of Akhnaton. The reason for the coincidence of their two beliefs may have been simply that both Moses and Akhnaton were in- structed in the same mysteries; and each derived the elements of the religion he preached from the same sources. That Moses was an initiate of the esoteric Egyptian rites is extremely probable. (\"Moses, before he was sent by God to the Israelites, was not only learned in all the wis dom of the Egyptians but was also mighty in words and in deeds.\" St. Stephen, \"Acts.\") Since he was brought up at court by a princess of the royal family, he was probably admitted to some of the highest degrees of the mysteries. It is from there that he must have taken his monotheistic views a nd his moral principles. In a word, it was probably in the mysteries that he received the initiation which he later transmitted to the Jews. He set up for them the mass initiation characterized by the circumcision. This theory does not contradict that part of the Freudian thesis which assumes that Moses was not a Jew but an Egyptian. To back up his thesis that Moses was an Egyptian, Freud advanced the hypothesis that he could not even speak the language of the Jews. According to the Bible, Moses had"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 281 a speech defect, and Aaron, who is described as his brother, spoke in his stead to the people . Freud assumes that in reality Moses spoke only the Egyptian language and did not know that of the Jews. He used Aaron—a Jew who was not his brother—simply as an interpreter. Let us add that we may accept the Biblical description of \"Aaron brother of Moses\" as not an absolute untruth. Aa ron may have been a Jew who was himself initiated into the Egyptian mysteries and there- fore considered by Moses as a \"Brother.\" Moses, although an Egyptian, possibly a member of the royal family, may have had good reasons for leaving Egypt. He might have considered th e Jews good human material to which to apply his teachings, provided he could free them from slavery. He knew that once he succeeded in leading them from Egypt he would no longer be hindered by the Egyptian priests from revealing the secret doctrines. According to this view the Jewish religion—one of the modern religions which contributed to Western civilization— has carried forward Egyptian initiative teachings. Certain of its characteristics are inherited, of course, from the ancient Jewish religion—but its most im portant teachings, principally the monotheistic views, and the moral teachings, are prob- ably of Egyptian inspiration. Greek Influence on the Jewish Sects Thus far we have seen that Greece and Judaea, two great spiritually creative forces (which, according to common be- lief, have had an immense infl uence on Western civilization), seem to have been inspired to a great extent by common or at least very closely related sources. We have traced these sources to Egypt and more particularly to the Egyptian mysteries. Let us now see how the Christian religion fits into this pic- ture—a religion which has had an even greater influence on"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"282 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY our civilization than the Greek mysteries and the Jewish religion. At the time of the birth of Christ the Jews were scattered in many places besides Pale stine, among Romans and Greeks and other peoples—in Babylon, Alexandria, Syria, Macedonia, Asia Minor, etc. They had preserved their own traditions, but had necessarily felt also the infl uences of the various civiliza- tions with which they had come into contact. The clear and limpid, legalistically brilliant but not very deep, Roman civili- zation does not seem to have ha d a great effect on them. On the contrary, the more profound, more mystical Greek civili- zation had a definite influence on the Jewish thinking of the epoch. The different philos ophical schools—the Stoics, the Pythagoreans, and the Platonis ts, for example—had by that time spread widely certain teach ings which had formerly been confined to the secret rites of the mysteries. In addition to the masses of the people three \"mystical\" (or \"philosophical\") sects existed among the Jews: the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essene s. Flavius Josephus (Jewish historian, A . D . 37-95) who mentioned these three sects, says of the Pharisees that they were \"kin of the sect of Stoics, as the Greeks called them.\"* About the Essenes, he says; \"These men live the same kind of life as do those whom the Greeks call Pythagoreans.\"** This seems to indicate that at least two of the three Jewish sects arose under Greek influence. We are primarily interested in the role of the Essenes becau se we can trace, through them, the thread leading to Christianity.

They refused to accept anything of the Jewish religious traditions which went beyond the written word of the Old Testament. Some authors even think that they did not believe in the religious doctrines at all, and recognized the Old Testament simply to keep up appearances. In any case they refused to believe in the im- mortality of the soul, a concep t which was by then—probably due to the influence of the Greek mysteries—part of the oral traditions of the two other Je wish sects. The information available about the Sadducees is too fragmentary to allow us to make any deductions concerning their influence on West- ern civilization. We know a little more about the Pharisees. They are gen- erally recalled as men full of avarice, pride and hypocrisy—a description attributed to Christ. It is probable that Christ's anger was directed only at the black sheep among the Phari- sees rather than at this sect in its entirety. It is, furthermore, possible that there may have been many such black sheep. The Pharisees, as a group, exercised considerable influence on the common people. Possibly their great power corrupted many of them. But whatever may have been the failings of the Pharisees as individuals—failings which have been castigated by Christ—we can recognize among their teachings several doctrines, probably of Greek origin, which seem to have been taken over by Christianity. The Pharisees taught that man's soul is immortal and that there is resurrection for the souls of the good. They also believed in the existence of angels. These doctrines, which, as we know, appeared later in Christianity, did not exist in the original teachings of Moses. The most obvious explana- tion of their origin is that they were taken by the Pharisees from the ancient mysteries: the \"secret\" in the highest degrees of the Eleusinian Mysteries included immortality of the soul and everlasting life; further, th e concept of resurrection taught by the Pharisees, while it closely resembles the later Christian"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"284 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY idea of resurrection, also in a certain sense corresponds to the Greek metempsychosis. (The theory of the \"angels\" may have been taken by the Jews from the mysteries of Zoroaster dur- ing their sojourn in Babylon.) Everything is ruled by God's will—and the individual, nevertheless, preserves his free wi ll concerning all things that depend upon him. There was no contradiction between these two concepts for the Pharisees and neither is there for the Christians. Like St. Augustine af ter them, the Pharisees also spoke of the \"Kingdom of God on earth.\" God's power is above that of the earthly rulers, they said, and they refused to render oath to the Roman Emperors. Thus the sect of the Pharisees in a certain sense constituted a transition between Greek mystical teachings and Christian- ity. A much more striking transitional role between the two civilizations was played, however , by the third sect, the Es- senes. We can assume that qu ite a number of the basic doc- trines of the Jewish Essenes came from Greece—and these doctrines were also very clos e to those later taught in the Christian religion. C onsequently the Essenes must have been ideal disciples of Christ when he came—fully prepared to ac- cept his teachings and to be abso rbed within his new religion. We can also say that if the Christian religion had not been born, the Essenes would probably have continued to exist as a Jewish sect of distinctive ch aracter or would have become the founders of a separate relig ion, proclaiming a truth very close, in many respects, to wh at we know today as Chris- tianity. We shall give special attention to the Essenes because we are inclined to think that this Jewish sect represents the most important \"missing link\" between the secret Greek teachings and the beginnings of Christiani ty. They are a sort of junction between the Greek and the Western civilizations. The Essenes may appear to be, at first glance, far from our present-day problems.

The \"Missing Link\" Between Greek Teachings and Christianity According to the description of Josephus, the Essenes showed great affection for one another. They lived in a sort of community which may have been the inspiration for the religious orders of Christianity. They despised riches and none of them had more than another. \"For, it is a law among them that those who come to them must let what they have be common to the whole Order: inasmuch that among them all there is no appearance of povert y, or excess of riches; but everyone's possessions are intermingled with every other's possessions; and so there is, as it were, one patrimony among all the brethren , . . nor do they allow of the change of garments or of shoes till they be first entirely torn to pieces or worn out by time. As for their piety towards God it is very extraordinary. For before sunrising they speak not a word about profane matters; but put up certain prayers which they have received from their forefathers as if they made supplication for its rising.\"* Then they are sent away by their \"curators\" to exercise some of the arts in which they are skilled. They work five hours, assemble again, take bath s of purification in cold water and clothe themselves with white veils. Then only do they sit down to eat one kind of food, but it is unlawful to taste the food before the priest has said grace. After their meal grace is said again. Then they lay aside their white garments and return to their labors. For supper they proceed in the same manner. Clamor and loud discussions are prohibited, but * Flavius Josephus, Wars of the Jews.

They do nothing without the in- structions of their \"curators\" except assisting those in want; they can, of their own free will, give help or food to those who are in distress. Whatever they say has more weight than oath but they have no right to swear. Swearing is considered by them worse than perjury*—but in spite of this prohibi- tion, the neophyte who is admitted into their sect** must swear at the moment of initiati on \"that he will neither con- ceal anything from those of his own sect, or discover any of their doctrines to others.\" This is the same sort of vow of secrecy as can be found not onl y in the ancient Greek and Egyptian mysteries, but also in the latter-day religious orders and in the various secret societies of the Middle Ages. The Essenes' attitude toward pain and torture, as described by Josephus, is very reminiscen t of what we know about the early martyrs of Christianity: \"They contemn the miseries of life, and are above pain by the generosity of their mind. And as for death, if it will be for their glory, they esteem it better than living always. And indeed our war with the Romans gave abundant evidence what great souls they had in their trials. Wherein, although they were tortured and distorte d, burned and torn to pieces, and went through all kinds of instruments of torment that they may be forced either to blaspheme their legislator, or to eat what was forbidden them; yet could they not be made to do either of them: nor once to flatter their tormentors or to * Christianity contains similar inj unctions against swearing; those of Christ, Mart.

But they smiled in their very pains; and laughed those to scorn who inflicted the torments upon them; and resigned up their souls with great cheerfulness: as expecting to receive them again.\" It is clear that this is the very same human material as that of which the early Christians we re made. So long as they were Jews of the sect of Essenes th ey refused to blaspheme their \"legislator\"—i.e., Moses. When they were called Christians, they showed the same fidelity toward their Saviour. As for the doctrines of the E ssenes, Josephus gives a picture which would suggest that these doctrines were born out of the contact of the original Jewish beliefs with certain Greek teachings—which all seem to or iginate from the Eleusinian Mysteries:* \"Their doctrine is that bodies are corrupted and that the matter they are made of is not permanent; but that the souls are immortal and continue forever; and that they are come out of the most subtile air, and are united to their bodies as to prisons, into which they are drawn by a certain natural enticement. But that, when they are set free from the bonds of the flesh, they then, as released from a long bondage, rejoice and mount upward. And this is like the opinion of the Greeks, that good souls have their habitations beyond the ocean; and in the region that is neither oppressed with the storms of rain, or snow or inte nse heat: but that this place is such as refreshed by the gentle breathing of a West Wind that is perpetually blowing from the ocean. While they allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous den, full of never-ceasing punishments. And indeed the Greeks seem to have followed the same notion when they allot the islands of their blessed to their brave men whom they call 'heroes' and 'demigods'; and to the souls of the wicked, the region of the ungodly in Hades: where their fables relate that certain persons such as * We have seen that elsewhere Josephus compared the doctrines of the Essenes to the Pythagorean teachings—w hich themselves were closely con- nected with the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"288 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY Sisyphus, Tantalus, Ixion and Tityus are punished: which is built on this first supposition that souls are immortal. And thence are those exhortations to virtue, and dehortations from wickedness collected; whereby good men are bettered in the conduct of their lives by the hope they have of reward after their death; and whereby the vehement inclinations of bad men to vice are restrained, by the fear and expectation they are in, that although they should lie concealed in this life, they should suffer immortal puni shment after their death. These are the divine doctrines of the Essenes about the soul: which lay an unavoidable bait for such as have once had taste of their philosophy.\" According to Josephus, there were approximately four thou- sand Essenes in his time. Alt hough they called themselves Jews they could just as well be considered the disciples of a new religion—probably evolved, as we have surmised, from the contact of the Jewish faith with Greek mystic teachings. They were excluded from the common court of the Temple. This is not surprising in vi ew of the extremely unorthodox character of their Jewish beliefs. The Converging Trends of the Upward Progression We have given much attention to the Essenes because this multi-faced sect, which professed to be Jewish and which was Greek in many of its doctrines, closely approached the early forms of Christianity. Conseque ntly the Essenes, whatever may have been their actual histor ical influence, played a role which typified the spiritual process which was taking place at the same time in various fiel ds during the period of gesta- tion of Western civilization: * certain Greek and Jewish ele- ments merged in various proporti ons, and resulted in ideas and * We could mention for example the Therapeutes, another Jewish sect which, under the influence of Greek teach ings, came to resemble a Christian sect very closely."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 289 institutions of a purely Christian character.

In addition to the more prof ound effect of the mystical teachings—about which we have spoken—-we pointed out the possibility that the teachings of the philosophers had a lim- ited influence at the same time, particularly among the learned. On the other hand, there moved along with the main cur- rent of Christianity various so -called heretical currents. The latter were condemned by the Church—which was acting in natural self-protection against a confusing over-diversification"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"290 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY and splitting up of its basic doctrines. These currents (Manicheism, Gnosticism, Cathar ism, etc.) were nevertheless excellent vehicles of the Upward Progression and carried it into extremely diversified circles. There were teachings for the most dissimilar tastes and fo r the various degrees of mental evolution of mankind. They repl aced, in a certain sense, the multiple degrees of initiation of the original mysteries, which, as pointed out earlier, corresponde d to these various degrees of mental development. Historically more important than all sub-teachings, the Church of Rome became a most extraordinary mass initiation of the barbarous people of Eur ope and later of several other continents as well. If it had not firmly established its own traditions during the long centuries preceding the Reforma- tion the various Protestant religions would never have been able to display such remarkable unity in their basic Christian substance. Christianity: Vehicle of Initiation and Civilization This is not the moment to examine the arguments of the two camps in the age-old discussion between the defenders and the critics of Rome. From our point of view only one thing counts: that all Christia n religions carried around the world the seeds of the same initiation and the same civilization. As we have said before, we are concerned here only with the moral content and influence of the Christian religions. The spiritual teachings and the Christian cosmogony are be- yond our scope except insofar as they are vehicles for certain moral truths. In this moral dom ain Christianity certainly has acted as an \"eye-opener\" on a very large scale: it has revealed to people nurtured on barbarous concepts what we commonly consider a higher or a better moral truth. It has shown them this moral truth as deriving from certain spiritual teachings— immortality of the soul, God a spirit, man coming from God"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 291 and returning to God. These are the same kinds of teachings as those which were imparted to the initiates of the highest mysteries, and the same types of moral principles were de- duced in both cases. We have seen that in addition to these spiritual deductions of a morality there was also in the Greek and Egyptian mys- teries a \"utilitarian\" or \"pragm atic\" type of deduction. This was based on the agricultural di scoveries of Demeter and to a certain extent on the invention of wine by Dionysos. The lat- ter was the sort of \"utilitarian\" revelation which brought the Greeks from the \"life with thorns\" to the concept of a \"ground\" life. These elements of the Greek mysteries—which already existed in Egypt—are present within Christianity in an even more veiled form symbolically. Their nearest equiv- alent is the sacrament of the Ho ly Eucharist with its \"tran- substantiation\" of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. According to Saint Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theo- logica, LXXIII, 6), this sacramen t was prefigured in the Jew- ish religion by the bread and wi ne offered up by Melchizedek, and also by the manna which contained—as a spiritual nour- ishment—every flavor and every sweetness. The different sacraments, the baptism, the confirmation, etc., probably cor- respond to the different degrees of the ancient initiation. There were seven degrees in the Eleusinian Mysteries and there are seven sacraments in the Catholic religion. A detailed compari- son cannot be undertaken here. Of the two types of deduction of the same moral truth— the \"utilitarian\" and the spiritual, which had coexisted in the Greek mysteries (in two differen t degrees of initiation)—the accent in this case was placed on the spiritual.

They were made to understand, by the use of transparent symbols, that the exchange of the fruits of the earth could procure them much greater happiness than the sort of happiness they used to find in the \"life with thorns.\" This practical deduction was deemed understandable by the common initiates. The happiness to be found in \"mystical love\" and, on a higher level, the happiness in the post-mortem unity of the human soul with the One, were truths reserved for the se- lected few. Teachings which are very close to these latter truths were given the principal role for the determination of human happiness by Christianity, although this religion opened wide to everyone the doors of initiation. In Christianity the perfect happiness of man consists in the \"vision of God.\" Man cannot possess this perfect happiness on earth—he can only prepare himself for it. The \"vision of God\" means for man the possession of all good and the exclu- sion of all evil.* Christianity considered all men capable of understanding this mystical origin of happiness from the moment Christ came into the world. The coming of Christ to earth thus represents, in a certain sense, the descent of the esoteric mysteries from their former Olympian heights. The Role of the \"Marginal\" Movements of Christianity In addition to official Christia nity and the \"heretical\" Chris- tian doctrines, several secret societies served as vehicles of moral education in the Middle Ages. The moral teachings of the Rosicrucians and of the es oteric guild of the cathedral builders (the \"operative Masons\") were close to the moral laws of the Church, but were e xpressed in the form of secret symbols. The Order of the Templars, one of the Knights' Orders of the Church, also had its \"secret.\" In a certain sense * St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, III, 8, IV, 1-8 and V, 7."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 293 these secret societies represented the persistence of the ancient esoteric methods. In many respects they seem to have de- scended from the Essenes, the Greek mysteries, and perhaps even from Egypt. All these societies were active participants in the Upward Progression of mankind. Their primary con- cern was the perfecting of the individual and humanity. At first glance this purpose a ppears to be one which might just as well have been publicly disclosed. But considerations similar to those which weighed with the heads of the ancient mysteries* made these societies also proceed in secret. Victor Magnien (in Les Mysteres d'Eleusis) states, \"The existence of secret or closed societies in which certain teachings or certain practices are transmitted to selected and proven people corresponds to a very general tendency of human nature.\" During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the so- called \"speculative\" (i.e., purely philosophical) Masonry reached an outstanding position among the secret societies. A heated argument has been carried on among French his- torians daring recent years to decide whether Masonry did or did not contribute to the coming of the French Revolution. It seems to us that by thoroughly discussing in its lodges ideas which were certainly \"Christian\" ideas in the moral sense, and which were in contradic tion to the tyrannical, feudal practices of the epoch, French Masonry undoubtedly pre- pared the way for the liberating elan of the Revolution. But so did Christianity itself, wh ich by reason of its teachings exercised a continual influence in the direction of the Upward Progression, even though occasionally leading members of the Church were allies of the very powers their teachings opposed. The ways of civilization are often paradoxical. Ideas and trends spread through contradictory channels (which makes it possible for them to penetrate much more deeply into varied strata of society). The different Christian religions have fre- * See page 267."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"294 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY quently been in conflict am ong themselves. Rome, which was anxious to keep Christianity united, combated the Reforma- tion as strenuously as it had fought against the heretical teach- ings. Furthermore there has l ong been a ban against Masonry by Rome, although originally many outstanding members of the Church belonged to this secret organization. We have to consider all thes e as \"internal struggles,\" be- cause fundamentally Rome, th e different other Christian religions* and the secret societie s of the Masonic type all pur- sue the same goals—at least in the moral field. They all fur- ther the same sort of moral education of mankind, although they may differ as to how this education can be effected. Even certain schools of thought which scorn \"mystical\" methods in the pursuit of their aims have performed the same task in the process of civilization as the religions and secret societies. Modem social doctrines and movements, for ex- ample, have carried forward Greco-Christian moral ideas in their own way. They have spread these ideas in circles whose mentality is geared to a \"pos itive\" approach and which would have refused to accept them from any \"mystical\" source. These movements—although they generally do not boast of this ancestry—nevertheless stem from the same Greco-Chris- tian roots as the modern religions and the other mystical teachings. Their entire content, both the \"critical\" and the \"constructive,\" is based on a mo ral outlook which is essen- tially Greco-Christian, or which, at least historically speak- ing, has evolved from Greco-Christian mystical thought. We cannot examine here the pros and cons which are gen- erally advanced concerning th e modern economic and social theories currently called \"Mar xism.\" We distinguish between modern Marxism and basic Marx ism, because the latter, the Marxism of Marx, was principa lly \"critical\"—not \"construc- * We could call them \"Judeo-Christia n religions\"—and we could add to them, probably, most other contemporary religions, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, etc."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 295 tive\" like the doctrines of his modern disciples. It is irrelevant to our present purposes whether we consider Marx's criticism of capitalist society justified or unjustified; and whether we favor or violently oppose the co llectivist solutions which are advocated by the disciples of Marx. Whichever be the case, we must admit that Marx's critical attitude is based on Greco- Christian moral premises. It is the critical attitude of a man who, inspired by his Greco-Christian outlook on life, con- siders—rightly or wrongly—certain prevailing conditions un- just. The earlier socialist theories, mostly French—those of Fourier, Saint-Simon, Proudhon, Bl anc, etc.—were all more or less based on the premise that \"man is good,\" with a defi- nitely Greco-Christian meaning of the word \"good.\" The same can be said about the various trends and ideas which are comprised in the very general expression \"free thought.\" Free-thinkers also refuse to recognize the role of mystical sources of inspiration in their interpretation of moral- ity. As a matter of fact, however, their ethical ideal has evolved either from the Christian type of thinking or from the Greek philosophers—and the latter were influenced either directly or indirectly by the mysteries. Even those types of \"free-thought tendencies\" which con- sider themselves in absolute opposition to Greek and Christian ideas derive indirectly from the same sources of inspiration as the latter. Here we have in mi nd the various trends of popu- lar thought which are more or less related to the different \"utilitarian\" and \"pragmatist\" philosophies. \"Usefulness\" is considered the basic gauge of morality—and no divine, mystic, or intuitive moral standard is recognized by these schools. In practice the moral conclusions and judgments of such free-thinkers generally coincide with the Greco-Christian moral ideas. The reason for this is that, while they make their moral conclusions dependent upon the concept of \"useful- ness,\" they must at that point decide what should be consid-"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"296 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY ered \"useful.\" The question then becomes one of choice—of preference—and not of scientific determination, since the \"utility\" desired depends entirely on the sort of future visual- ized for the individual or mankind. In determining our preferences, there are apparently no weightier reasons for turning in one direction than in another. We therefore turn where \"our heart belongs.\" Because even \"utilitarian\" free-thinkers are unconsciously influenced by their Greco-Christian background, in practice their moral con- clusions and judgments coincide with Greco-Christian moral ideas. The Prusso-Teutonics Fight the Whole Upward Progression It was not our purpose in the preceding pages to review systematically the different moral doctrines which have con- tributed to the formation of We stern civilization. Our object was simply to examine briefly the roots which are common to all groups and elements compos ing the Upward Progression. We have distinguished in this Upward Progression such ele- ments as Greek civilization, the Roman legal school of thought, Judeo-Christian religions, huma nitarian movements, modern social doctrines, democratic traditions (see page 246). In the opposite camp is Prusso-Teutonism, part of the Downward Progression—a part wh ich has developed to gigan- tic proportions. It is not due to the caprice of a single man that Prusso- Teutonism (represented at the moment by Hitler) is so vio- lently opposed to all constituent parts of the Upward Progres- sion. This opposition is somethi ng basic and organic; and it was inevitable—Hitler does no more than give it current expression in his brutal and mediumistic way. Both Hitler and the Prusso-Teutonics fight the battle piece- meal. They reveal only fragments of their spiritual intentions (just as they have revealed only in fragments their inten-"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND UPWARD PROGRESSION 297 tions of conquest of the diffe rent surrounding countries), in an erfort to keep all the spiritual and material forces they wish to destroy from forming an alliance among themselves. Our task therefore is to join together, to synthesize, these elements of the Upward Progression which the Prusso-Teutonics strive to split apart and destroy. It is for this reason that the possible outline of such a synthesis was suggested in the present chapter."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"CHAPTER X COMMON FOE AND COMMON N O B I L I T Y T HE VARIOUS CURRENTS , schools of thought, movements, re- ligions, etc., which have contributed to our Upward Progres- sion are usually split among themselves by their doctrinal differences and disputes. In nor mal times, this is as it should be because these conflicts resu lt in further progress. From time to time, however, these internal disagreements become so sharp, so passionate, that ir reparable cleavages divide one group from another within the same camp. In times like the present—when outside danger of quite a different character threatens the members of the camp of the Upward Progres- sion—such internal division ma y have disastrous effects. Mutual hatred and passion often so warp the vision of those participating in the Upwatd Progression that they may not always distinguish the difference in character between, on the one hand, their normal disagr eements with other members of their own camp, and, on the other, the much more pro- found difference with the outside foe. Some time ago the remark wa s jokingly made that the people of the earth would never forget their differences until the inhabitants of Mars threatened an invasion. The actions of the Prusso-Teutonics bear the same relation to the world as those of the Martians might have: the ideas and practices which the former try to enforce on our world are not mere variations within the same cultural stream. They attempt to subject us to the rules and habits of a life based on quite a different concept from ours—a concept which is as alien as though it came from a different planet.

The Common Ground When certain words become \"attached\" to certain groups, it may be resented if they are used in connection with other groups. We have spoken in preceding pages about the \"initia- tion\" through which the various component parts of the Upward Progression have passed. We are well aware that use of the word \"initiation\" may arouse resentment on the part of those groups which do not recognize their relationship to mys- tical trends. However, the expr ession \"initiation\" can be used in a very general sense in the history of human thought to refer to the \"eye-opening\" process mentioned in preceding pages. It is both in this sense and, in the case of the religions and mystical groups, in a \"mystical\" sense as well that we have employed the word \"initiation. \" We tried to point out that the different groups within the Upward Progression all origi- nated in the same \"initiation, \" in the same \"eye-opening\" process. It is important that all those individuals and groups which can trace back their spiritual ancestry to this initiation should fully realize this ; and that they should see clearly that it is this which separates them definitely and irrevocably from the groups within the Downward Progression.* This common spiritual ancestry represents for all members of the Upward Progression a sort of nobility of which all should be proud, no matter what ideological differences may have separated them in the past.

In the meantime, however, let us explore fully the meaning of our common \"nobility,\" so fully that we will be able to take a much more effective stand against the threat which comes from the outside and dates from the Dark Ages. We do not claim to chart out in this book the definite \"common ground\" on which all members of this spiritual nobility, all participants of the Upward Progression, can firmly establish their lines of defens e. We hope, however, that the theme we have suggest ed will be elaborated upon. Most indi- viduals, nations, groups, etc., ha ve instinctively understood what the danger of Nazism means. But there exist numerous doubts and uncertainties concerning the roots of this danger and its extent. On the other hand , not all appreciate fully that it is of a nature quite different from the usual struggles and differences of opinion which aris e between parties, religions, movements, etc. Whatever may be the daily ups and downs of the war, it is important that we strengthen our internal \"spiritual front.\" This is what will enable us to win both the war and the peace. The \"Common Initiation\" We should not be ashamed of our origins. By this is meant that we should not be afraid to recognize, at least historically, the \"mystical,\" initiative ba ckground which lies behind our mental evolution. Initiation came to our ancestors and to our- selves through varied channels which, in the ancient mys- teries, all converged. Whether our initiation came through one of these channels or through all of them, it is still the same initiation and it represents a common bond for all of us.

Not all individuals who belong to the different groups which participated in the Upward Progression can be consid ered fully initiate in our sense. The process of civilization is a slow one. It may ap- proach its goal. It never reac hes it, and its achievements are full of imperfections. The various religions, moral doctrines, etc., which have contributed to Western civilization have on the whole, however, effected a wonderful change in the world during the last thousand years or so. The civilizing process will perhaps never penetrate into all recesses of our human society. But these recesses become ever fewer and fewer. We and our ancestors thought that nothing within these recesses could enda nger the balance of the whole. We looked upon the remnants of the primitive \"non-initiated\" concept of life*—the numerous reactionary, feudal-minded groups—simply as picturesque anachronisms. We attached little importance to them because the varied driving forces of the Upward Progression were at work against them, simul- taneously in joy, bloodshed and te ars, on all levels of society, and thus a continual housecleaning was effected. The isolated survival of elements of the Downward Pro- gression would indeed have ha d no great consequence while the dynamic influence of the Upward Progression was setting the tone for the Western world and, more or less, for the world as a whole. But all estimates were upset by the fact that the driving forces of the Downward Progression had accumulated considerable power in their seclusion in East Prussia and recently have pushed their way to the foreground of world events. Those who represented the Upward Pro- gression were taken by surprise —and the present struggle is the result. * These survived everywhere, in cluding the democratic countries."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"302 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The Prusso-Teutonic \"Pseudo-Esoterism\" We face a paradoxical situation. The basic concepts of the Upward Progression originated in esoteric mysteries. These concepts later came out into the sunlight, expressed at first by exoteric, openly taught religions and then by even more openly revealed doctrines of various movements and schools of thought. On the other hand, the primitive barbaric forces which flourished in Europe and exis ted openly everywhere (during the period which preceded the civilizing effect of the mys- teries, religions, and different currents of Western thought) realized that they could survive and acquire new power only if they in their turn used methods of secrecy. Now they face us with all the advantages which these methods give to those who employ them. So while the initiation into a higher moral truth came more and more into the open, the forces which tried to preserve the way of life which was once the common way have retreated into the isolation of their secret societies whence they manipu- late power they have accumulated. We must watch this paradoxical situation. Under normal circumstances the forces of the Upward Progression would have every advantage in the struggle now taking place (both in the spiritual and material fields) because of the mass ap- peal of the \"initiation into the higher moral truth.\" This ad- vantage is, however, somewhat diminished by the fact that most of these upward forces have been acting in the open for centuries now and have lost the benefits of their earlier secrecy. Furthermore their activ ities have been conducted in a non-concentrated, more or less haphazard manner, each force isolated from the other. During this time the Prusso-Teutonics have gradually formed their own secret organizations in which they have cleverly aped certain traditions of form created by the other"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 303 camp.* Within these se cret organizations they have been con- centrating their forces, and have planned their action for many years ahead. The \"Common Language\" The Prusso-Teutonics have succeeded during the last seven decades in inculcating their own ideas in the minds of a great number of people whom we would expect to be proud of their allegiance to the principles of the Upward Progression. These people—German-speaking people in Germany and in other parts of the world—had already passed through the civilizing initiative process of Christianity. Ne vertheless, be- cause they were made to believe that a common language implies more fundamental comm on bonds, they let themselves be dragged by the Prusso-Teutonics along the slope of the Downward Progression. This reasoning of the Prusso- Teutonics convinced many Germans, in spite of its fallacy, because from the Upward Progression there came no organ- ized effort to point out the truth to the German-speaking people: that only the superfici al symbolism of a common lan- guage united them to the Downward Progression of the Prusso-Teutonics; and that they were spiritually more at- tached to the Upward Progression. The world itself has been confused by vaguely mystic ideas concerning the significance and unifying effect of a common language. It was because of this confusion that the Prusso- Teutonics were able to gain acceptance for their fallacious reasoning. The German-speaking people were more or less abandoned by the rest of the world, and thus became an easy prey for the Prusso-Teutonics. * Hitler himself fits well into this pi cture with his penchant for a certain kind of mystical teachings. But Hitler's \"esoterism,\" like that of the Prusso- Teutonics, has nothing to do with the real initiation. Rather it is a blend of charlatanism and black magic."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"304 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The Formation of the Abscess The Egyptian and Greek mysteries, the Jewish religion and sects, finally Christianity and its \"marginal\" movements, spread everywhere the concepts of cooperation, exchange of goods, brotherly love, sympathy, etc. The Prusso-Teutonic forces we have described set up their center of resistance in East Prussia. They acted under the initial impetus given by a visionary Emperor, and a fe udal society which—in the face of the rapidly spreading ideas of the Upward Progression— sought to survive in the guise of a secret organized Order. Thus they formed a sort of abscess in an otherwise pre- dominantly healthy body. By wrapping themselves in the cloak of secrecy, by adopting secret methods, by isolating themselves for centuries from the rest of mankind, they devel- oped into a real danger for the world. During this time other feudal remnants in all countries, not isolated from the organic life of the globe, were caught up in the healthy stream cir- culating through the body as a whole and became less and less important in world affairs. (An exception may perhaps be made in the case of the survival of feudalism in Japan which in several respects is analogous to the Prusso-Teutonic situation.) Using the same figure as before : no compromise is possible between the healthy cells of the world-body and the abscess full of decaying matter. Once the centuries-old wall which the abscess has built around itself has burst there are but two possibilities: either the abscess spreads over the whole body and transforms it into a decaying organism, or the healthier elements of the body get th e upper hand and succeed in resorbing the abscess entirely. The Three Types of Moral Initiation We did not enter here and we cannot enter here into a detailed analysis of the eye- opening process which humanity"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 305 has experienced—of the moral in itiation we have mentioned. We know this much: that it was a complex and intricate proc- ess, because its different phases which originated in the ancient mysteries developed through va ried forms in the modern religions. Although not everyone fully absorbed the different phases of this initiation, human society in general is more or less \"permeated\" by their meani ng—either directly or through the example given by others—and it was through this alone that the general advance of morality occurred. Schematically the different phases of the \"moral initiation\" seem to emerge as follows from the ancient mysteries and from varied, more recent sources: 1. The discovery of agriculture is represented in the an- cient mysteries by the initiation into the \"Life Without Thorns.\" Corresponding symbols are the stalks of grain, the manna, the \"bread\" of the Holy Eucharist and bread in gen- eral. The daily benedi ction of bread by the Essenes and by the Christians enters into this category. \"Bread\" represents, according to a very ancient terminology, much more than its nutritive value—it represents human nourishment in general; (compare expressions like \"Our daily bread,\" \"Panem et cir- censes,\" etc.). The symbolic re presentation of the discovery of agriculture corresponds at th e same time to a higher stage of moral understanding: with the possibility of exchanging the products of the earth it is no longer worth while to base our daily existence on plunde r and killing—it is becoming more satisfactory to leave behind the \"Life with Thorns.\" This process could be called a \"utilitarian\" or \"material\" deduction of a morality. 2. At a higher degree of the ancient mysteries we find the initiation into \"mystical love.\" The latter, in the time of Christendom, becomes \"human sympathy\" and \"Christian love.\" This process is, in a certain sense, a \"humanitarian\" deduction of a morality. 3. The highest understanding of the moral truth derives from concepts, like \"immortality of the soul,\" \"everlasting"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"306 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY life,\" \"unity of the human soul with God.\" (These concepts, which existed in the ancient mysteries, can be found among the pre-Christian sects of the Jews and have considerable importance in Christianity.) We may call this process a \"meta- physical\" deduction of a morality. The understanding of any of these three initiations may be sufficient to motivate an abandonment of the \"Life with Thorns\" and an elevation to a higher moral level. Although they are different in form, they all coincide in meaning— i.e., they project the same idea of goodness—and in a certain sense all three are superimposed one on the other in the minds of those who receive them all. The Prusso-Teutonics, in spite of the Christian guise under which they carried on their first activities, never grasped fully the meaning of any of these initiations. They did not grasp it: they refused to grasp it, or, rather, they were enabled to resist it because their basic charter and their \"secret\"*—which for them counted more than anything else—were inspired by opposed principles. These principles were those of feudal society, which society in its tu rn was only a disguise of bar- baric society. Spiritual and Material Interests Behind the Growth of the Abscess The Prusso-Teutonics based their future destinies on mo- tives of both spiritual and material character. Furthermore, as we have seen, the two sorts of motives were protected by a strictly guarded secret from the curiosity and troublesome interference of the outside world. This was the situation at the time of the Order and it continued when the Junker or- ganizations took over, for thei r own sake, the ambitions and the policies of the Order. These are the reasons why the Prusso-Teutonics succeeded in establishing such a lasting * \"Secret\"—in the sense usual for s ecret orders—consisting at the same time of a secret mission and secret methods."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 307 \"abscess\" of their own ideas and intentions within a more and more Christianized world. We have already examined these aims in greater detail. They included: perpetual conquest (in the full Hohenstaufen sense of the imperial drive toward world domination), furthering of the selfish personal interests of those who were participat- ing in these undertakings (the Knights and later the Junkers), and, in general, preservation of feudal principles in opposi- tion to a world moving in the direction of the Upward Pro- gression. What we consider \"spiritual\" and what \"material\" in these aims is irrelevant. They all contained elements of the two kinds. These aims consisted mainly jn the protection of the immediate egotistic interests of the participants and in the pursuit of unlimited ambitions which were nurtured to further the cause of some va guely defined entity. Great weight was added to the \"material\" interests of the Prusso- Teutonic drive by the inclusion of \"big business\"—heavy in- dustry—among the participants. This is but a detail, however, and the interests of big business alone cannot explain what is going on in Germany today. All these elements were strangely intermingled. The ego- tistical instincts were satisfied and flattered and gave way to all sorts of abuses—while the shield of devotion to a higher entity was flaunted above the heads so as to set the consciences at ease. Such a combination of aims was bound to have lasting effects, resulting in the creation of an inner body, or rather an \"abscess\" as we called it—an abscess completely foreign to the body which sheltered it. Of course the abscess could never have developed and survived to our day had the intervention of the outside world, the scalpel of the surgeon, removed it in time. The \"secret\" was there (and is still there to a great extent) and acts as protection from any such danger. The Fehme spirit represented another survival of the Down- ward Progression in Germany, also protected by a secret. Left"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"308 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY to itself the Fehme tradition mi ght definitely have died out, because it did not have so firm a foundation and was not so evenly balanced between spiritual and material aims as the Prusso-Teutonic tradition. But in combination with the latter tradition the Fehme spirit contributed to bringing the Down- ward Progression to the fore in all its brutality. What we have discussed here is, of course, not Nazism. And long after Nazism has disappeared it may still be there in Germany. Nevertheless it is on this soil that Nazism grew. It is a much more profound and insidious thre at to our Western civiliza- tion and to the whole Upward Progression than mere Nazism. At the Level of Plunder The mentality of man before he experienced any of the three types of initiation to which we refer above was entirely different from ours. It was, howev er, very similar to the sort of mentality which—in the actions of the Prusso-Teutonics and their satellites—arouses our moral indignation every day. Before man's mind was able to grasp any of the teachings which for us represent the moral truth, his happiness con- sisted in obtaining all he could from life by murder and rob- bery. It is quite natural that th is should have been so: he had not yet discovered agriculture—on which was to be based the simplest of all \"eye-opening\" initiations. He was, therefore, living in a world in which ec onomic values we re extremely limited in quality, diversity and number. The uncultivated earth had no value for man except as a hunting ground. In hunting it was not to his advantage to remain attached to the soil. The tribes which moved around most quickly were the most successful: it was these which succeeded in steal- ing the greatest number of ca ttle from the neighboring tribes after, in most cases, breaking their resistance by murder and pillage."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 309 In our evaluation of this behavior, there is no place for moral indignation: instead we must admit realistically that man at this stage of his ment al and economic evolution knew no better and that from his point of view he was completely justified in plundering and killing. It is fortunate that the acti on of Prusso-Teutonic Germany should constantly arouse our moral indignation. This indigna- tion has contributed to awakening us to the danger repre- sented by this Germany. But it is also useful to set the motivating impulses of the Prusso-Teutonics side by side for comparison with those of their not-so-distant ancestors in pre-initiative times. We can thus objectively appreciate all the propelling forces behind the disquieting present-day phe nomena. The question at this stage, then, is no longer one of indignation, hate and passion, but a matter of making a diagnosis, of finding the roots of the evil—and perhaps of finding a remedy. Pacifist Thought Is Powerl ess Before Conspiracy The usual \"pacifist\" type of thought which was in vogue after World War I completely fa iled to develop such a rem- edy. Even pacifists of the Norm an Angell type realize today that statements like \"War doesn't pay\" are utterly mean- ingless in the face of Nazi and Prusso-Teut onic phenomena. They are just as meaningless as such statements as \"Crime doesn't pay\" or \"Be good because it is profitable\" when ad- dressed to an inveterate criminal. \"War doesn't pay\" is a useful rationalization for the benefit of those whose moral background has been firmly established by the Upward Progression. It is an utterly empty statement when addressed to those who not only never did receive our type of moral initiation, but w ho, furthermore, are well pro- tected from even the accidental influence of this initiation by a firmly knit secret conspiracy directed along the path of the Downward Progression."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"310 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY The Elementary Understanding of a Morality Considering again the first type of moral initiation of the mysteries, to which we referre d above—the one based on the agricultural discovery—we find in it a basic idea very close to the modern concept that \"war does not pay.\" However, the moral truth in the mysteries reached the participants not as the result of cold rationa lization but through the profound effect of an intricate initiation which penetrated to the inner- most chambers of the heart. The texts we have quoted concerning the basic moral initia- tion of the mysteries are, of c ourse, themselves mere rational- izations; the initiation itself went much deeper. Nevertheless these texts are adequate presentations of the elementary proc- ess which first opened the eyes of our spiritual forefathers to what we consider morality. Isocrates says that a life superior to that of the animals has come from agriculture and that the initiation derived from the same source. (See page 268.) For Suidas the \"ground\" life which came from the initiation con- sists in the sharing of the goods of the earth by the inhabitants of the earth instead of their fighting and strangling one another.

It is this elementary understa nding of a morality spread by the various mysteries, in addition to a more subtle deduction of a morality contained in the higher degrees of the mysteries, which contributed most of all to bringing civilization (in our sense) first from Egypt and India to the East in general, and later to the Greek and Roman world. The Moral Groundwork Even those inhabitants of Greece and the Roman Empire who understood only the most el ementary moral ideas origi- nating from the Greek mysteries were fully prepared to ap- preciate the moral teachings of Christianity and consequently"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 311 to become excellent Christian converts. The monotheistic idea of God, Christian love, immortal ity of the soul, resurrection, man made in the image of God, were concepts which were readily accepted by those who had already received a first experience of the same type of doctrines, either directly or indirectly, either from the lower or from the higher degrees of the mysteries. A wonderful Christian synthesis was in the course of emerg- ing from the Egyptian, Greek and Jewish civilizations to become the general inspiration of the Western world. It was the period when the \"Kingdom of God on Earth\" seemed to be approaching. The original inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire were fully engaged in this process when they were overrun, during the first centuries of our era, by various barbaric tribes. These tribes, for the most part of Teutonic origin, were soon, at least on the surface, converted to Christianity. Although the first acceptance of the Christian doctrines by the barbarians was still somewhat superficial the moral trans- formation of these people was already well along the way toward gradual accomplishment in the subsequent genera- tions. But while the common people were passing slowly through a moral initiation which gave them title in the real \"nobility\" of the Upward Progression, the so-called nobles among the former barbarians were organizing everywhere to preserve their privileges from the reforming influence of the Greco-Christian moral conceptions. We have, consequently, the following picture: Among the Greeks, and to a certain extent also among the original inhabitants of the Ro man Empire, the highest classes of society had received in the mysteries, and had assimilated, the subtle moral doctrines which were later to become those of Christianity. The common pe ople had, directly and indi- rectly, benefited by the same doctrines.

No Groundwork Among Barbarians The barbarians reacted differently to such teachings. The common people among them were impressed by the \"impera- tive\" presentation of the divine law and by the sanctions im- posed by the Church. It was mostly because of such down-to- earth reasons that they were drawn into the Christian orbit. From then on it was inevitable that they would receive slowly but surely the full Christian moral initiation. The barbarian nobles, just like their commoners, did not at first sight grasp the full m eaning of the Christian moral teachings. But less impressed than the people by the \"impera- tive\" contents of religion and by the sanctions, they deter- mined to give their best efforts to safeguarding their tradi- tional, barbarously interprete d economic privileges against the modernizing tendencies of the Church. The whole feudal system was born out of this kind of endeavor: to maintain under a cloak of Christian chiv alry the barbarian methods of privilege, abuse, plunder, continual conquest and, if neces- sary, killing and deceit. The Carolingian Empire and later the so-called Holy Ro- man Empire of the German people were the most prominent organizations constituted by the feudal suzerains. The Em- peror's role being that of a s uper-suzerain, his rights, methods and aims were simply superlativ e of those of his vassals. The \"continual conquest of neighboring properties\" became in the case of the Emperors continual conquest of all lands not yet belonging to the Empire. Some of the Emperors were quite sincere in their spiritual acceptance of the Christian faith."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 313 But in the political and economic field their efforts were in flagrant opposition to the princi ples of Christianity. Conse- quently the Emperors necessari ly found themselves in con- stant conflict with the Church after they failed to absorb the whole clerical organization in the intricacies of the feudal system (for instance, by appointing as its princes men whom they could control). They professed to be sincere Christians and did not fully realize to what extent, politically, their conduct as well as that of thei r vassals, was still determined by the Downward Progression and by \"Life with Thorns.\" They were thus often sincerel y surprised and shocked when the Church did not appreciat e their political behavior. The Conspiracy Against Initiation The formation of the Teutonic Order was an organized attempt to secure survival of all the non-Christian privileges of the feudal empire and of feudal nobility during the cen- turies to come. The Order was thus both an organism carry- ing out an \"imperial mission,\" c onceived in a feudal sense, and a refuge for feudal nobility (which evolved from barbarian nobility). The latter needed the refuge because it saw its abusive privileges dwindling away in a society which was moving gradually in the directio n of the Upward Progression. The Order became a German institution simply because the Teutonic nobles (more so, for example, than those of Latin origin who were prepared for Christianity by the effect of the initiations) were Christianized only on the surface. They still clung to the economic principles deriving from the original barbarian customs. It is for the same reasons that the Fehme enterprise, having an origin and growth parallel to the Order, also arose on German soil. We have seen how the Teut onic Order and the secret societies which were to become its successors systematically carried forward the plans laid down at the time of their"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"314 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY formation. They represented, in the midst of a more and more thoroughly Christia nized German world, an obtuse sur- vival of economic and spiritual principles stemming from a different world. This living anachronism, whic h gradually took on the char- acter of actual conspiracy, engrai ned its principles so deeply on the minds of its participants that a sort of impenetrable crust was created. Through this crust elements of the Upward Progression could no longer re ach the minds. The Hohen- staufen Emperor, Frederick II, transmitted his resentment against the Church—which characterized the second part of his life—to the Order; but the Order itself, and the secret societies which emerged from it, developed into organisms even more violently opposed to Christianity and to the whole Upward Progression than Frederick ever was. The Order not only kept alive but ca rried to new heights the original spirit of privilege, abuse, plunder, perpetual conquest, and, if neces- sary, killing* and deceit usual among the barbarians and among the feudal lords. Still the Same Conspiracy We know how the Prusso-Teutonics brought the other German-speaking people under their rule. We saw also how Hitler's rise to power became possible only when he agreed to be their faithful servant, advancing their purposes on a world scale. Hitler takes all the credit and all the blame for everything that has been happening. He lik es the limelight, he likes the role he is permitted to play. As a matter of fact, Hitler is not the real problem in Germany today.

In this endeavor the Nazi movement in its present form is acting like any- exoteric movement, carrying out the basic aims of its own esoterism. Here the \"esoterism\" is the (pseudo-) esoterism of the Prusso-Teutonics—an esoterism based on \"downward\" principles. This is the same ba rbaric conspiracy against the constantly modernizing influenc e of the Greco-Christian civi- lization which has existed for centu ries. It is not by accident that Hitler considers Christiani ty (both Catholic and Protes- tant), Judaism, and Masonry as enemies. His object (and his \"bosses\" approve of it) is to stop the whole flow of the Up- ward Progression and to annihilate its institutions. Hitler knows that the political and economic world ruler- ship he wants to secure for Prusso-Teutonia (a world ruler- ship established, of course, on feudal economic principles) can be achieved only on one condition: the spiritual ideas behind the political and economic reality of the world must be completely broken off from Christianity, Greco-Chris- tianity, Judeo-Christianity—a nd from the Upward Progres- sion in general. The first purpose is to destro y the \"initiation,\" to push it into complete oblivion.

None of today's scientific discoveries would ha ve been possible. (Prusso-Teu- tonism and consequently Nazi sm, though aimed at the de- struction of our civilization, intends to preserve—for its sole benefit—the scientific discov eries which were possible only under this civilization.) Instead of our customary exchange of goods between individuals living in the most distant parts of the world—an exchange based on gold, which can circulate everywhere—we would be laboring under a cumbersome method of transfer of goods: a barter system completely regulated by the strongest group to its exclusive advantage. Of course the barter system would have resulted in an eco- nomic standard much less satis factory than our diversified exchange of goods based on a universal gauge of values. General poverty would have been the rule. Only the most powerful group would have profited: with the aid of this system the rest of the world could quite easily have been kept in subjection. Such a world without the benefits of civilization is purely hypothetical. The initiation wh ich produced civilization was not accidental but organic. Civ ilization—lack of space pre- vents detailed proof here—evolved out of an organic necessity of mankind. Even if the Prusso-Teutonics should succeed in destroying our civilization and the initiation with it, the latter—and, consequently, civ ilization itself—would eventu- ally be re-created by the human race to meet a vital necessity. But generations might elapse before this re-creation. In the meantime indescribable harm would have been done.

Welfare of the People Immaterial It is entirely understandable a nd in the nature of things that the economic Fuehrer of the Third Reich, Dr. Walter Funk, has laid out plans for a re-establishment of the barter system, governed by Berlin. To Dr. Funk and his Prusso- Teutonic masters it does not matte r if this should result in general poverty—because the world, thus impoverished, could be ruled by the Prusso-Teutonics much more easily. (Let us recall that the Prusso-Teutonics, in the period be- tween 1918 and 1933, deliberately and systematically effected the impoverishment of Germany in order to facilitate im- position of their rule over the country.) There is no point in proving to the present masters of Germany that such a system w ould result in economic disas- ter and in a loss by mankind of all prosperity. The fact that they are not concerned about the welfare of the people around them, and refuse to admit that their own welfare is dependent on that of others, is altogether to be expected from their super-feudal mentality. Their eyes are as closed to such higher moral and economic truths as were those of their forefathers in barbarous times. The only aim in which they are Interested is to reign over the largest possible territory even if it means reigning simply over deserts and cemeteries. It cannot be sufficiently empha sized how largely our basic economic conceptions derive from our moral and philosoph- ical outlook. We do not speak here about the prevailing capitalist system. Rather we are concerned with something much more basic: the univers al exchange of goods based on gold. \"Gold\" deserves a thor ough rehabilitation and vindica- tion from the slander to which it has been subjected. The in- troduction of gold as a universal symbol of values had a"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"318 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY tremendous and extremel y beneficial effect on the evolution of mankind. Without such an adoption of a universal symbol no universal exchange of goods and no world travel of any great proportions would have been possible. Gold—along with silver—would never have become the basis of exchange of goods had it not been for the moral and philosophical teach- ings contained in the various in itiations. The concept of \"shar- ing and not strangling\" taught by the Mysteries would have had no practical meaning wit hout a universal symbol of values which each individual could possess: only the use of some such symbol makes possi ble an actual sharing—i.e., exchange of distant goods including all goods other than exclusively personal belongings. Gold proved to be a satis- factory symbol of values. We cannot enter here into a detailed analysis of this ques- tion. We may add, however, that in ancient times gold, be- cause of its color and its other qualities, was considered a symbol of the sun and of divinity in general. (Silver sym- bolized the moon and the feminine element in divinity, of the Isis, Demeter, Juno type.) This suggests the sort of mental process which probably led to the acceptance of gold every- where as a satisfactory symbol of values. (Silver, of course, has also been used as a mone tary symbol: but it has been increasingly neglected as, in a parallel developm ent, mankind has become increasingly attached to the monotheistic concept of life.) The ability to possess gold, whether actually, or in the form of banknotes—a later development—is symbolically equivalent to the individual's \"participation in God.\" Simply an Abscess Nazism stunned the world by br utally unloosing on it all the barbarous practices and con cepts of the \"non-initiated\" Prusso-Teutonics—the spirit of abuse, plunder, deceit, per- petual conquest, etc. The worl d was stunned because it had not even suspected the existence of this danger which for"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"COMMON FOE AND COMMON NOBILITY 319 centuries had awaited the propitious moment to burst into the open.

Nevertheless many still attribute almost supernatural powers to Hitler or at least con- sider Nazism the e xpression of some marvelous dynamic force having, whether we like it or not, a great chance of success. This is one of the reasons why it is important to expose what Nazism really is and what lies behind it. It serves a use- ful purpose to bring to light the \"social abscess\" of Prusso- Teutonism with the pus of Nazism flowing out of it. The grave danger which this abscess represents is by no means negligible. We should not forget, however, that it is simply an abscess and nothing more . It is not some vital force, and it has no marvelous potentia lity. There is nothing super- natural about its sudden appearance.

Germany is neither a singl e, indivisible whole, danger- ous in its entirety, nor is it \"Two Germanies,\" of which but one, the Nazi Germany, represents the true danger. There are, in reality, \"Three Germanies.\" There is the first Germany—the Germany which can be considered \"good\": the Germany of ancient and honorable traditions, the Germany of Goethe, the Germany which has given us the great majority of German-Americans and the political refugees of 1848 and of 1933-1941. The spirit of this Germany, despite all outward appearances, may still be alive in the hearts of millions of Germans under the yoke of Hitlerism today. Then there is a second Germany, almost as old as the first, but vile and dangerous. Her tradit ions are no less deep rooted, no less ancient than those of the first Germany, but her true face is revealed only to the initiate. This is the Germany of \"pan-Germanism\" and \"Prussian- ism.\" We have called it the \"Prusso-Teutonic Germany,\" tracing it back to the founding of the Teutonic Order in the thirteenth century. This is the Germany which actually carried on those ideas of the Holy Roman Emperors which pointed toward world domination. This Germany has been very much alive during the last seven hundred years in East- ern Prussia and, during recent decades, its doctrines have penetrated wide categories of the population. It escaped world attention until the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries, because its activities seemed limited to the Eastern part of Europe. Of the three, \"First\" German y was the only one visible. It was there in the form of small German states loosely tied together within the Empire and inspired by the general prin- ciples of Christian morality.

This \"Second\" Germany, this Prusso-Teutonic Germany does not like to show her true face. She had adopted various disguises throughout history. Be fore 1918 she was disguised as Wilhelm II and the monarchy. Th e allies thought it was suffi- cient to overthrow the latter in order for everything to change, so that order might be restored in Germany. That is how Prusso-Teutonic Germany was able to avoid destruction, and in the years between the two wars was able to recon- struct her forces—forces which the rest of the world thought had been wiped out. Besides \"First\" and \"Second\" Germany, there remain Hitler and Nazism, which are what we may call \"Third\" Germany. This is a most formidable Germany indeed, but is in fact only the present front behind which are hidden all those pro- foundly dangerous elements inhe rent in Germania, the \"Sec- ond\" Germany.

The same sort of mistake woui d be repeated (as pointed out earlier) if Hitler and the Nazi party were to assume the blame alone and the rest of the Prusso-Teutonic group was thus enabled to continue its operations without interference. It is not likely that the Allies will be taken in by any offers of appeasement on Hitler's part. Even the Cliveden Set and the survivors among former Munichmen understand today that an agreement with the \"man of a hundred broken prom- ises\" would be purely illusory. But they might walk right into a trap in the event that the \"forces behind Hitler''' pro- posed the liquidation of the Fueh rer and his entire set-up and asked for an agreement based on these terms. As early as the end of 1939 and during the first months of 1940, several \"peace-feelers\" were sent out to Paris, London and Washington, calling for an understanding of this nature. The \"escape\" of Thyssen to Paris, the negotiations by Stinnes' son in London and the activities of that odd oil magnate, William Rhodes Davis, in Washington were all undertaken with this end in mind. All these men spoke in terms of re- placing Hitler by Goering—the Goering who, though the lieutenant of Hitler, enjoys the complete support of the forces behind Hitler. The purpose of rumors spread periodi- cally that Goering and Hitler do not get along well with one another is only to pave the way for some such intrigue.

It is the mad dance of the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" of the \"Golem,\" which can no longer be halted except through drastic and extreme measures.

Further it would enable them to hold and tighten their grip on the millions of German-speaking people. When in preceding chapters we spoke about the revolt of the German cities united against the Teutonic Order in the Marienwerder Bund in 1438, we sa id that this was a rebellion of the spirit of decency and cooperation against the principles of exploitation and narrow egotism. To obtain a permanent solution of the German problem this spirit—the spirit of the first Germany—must be reawakened . It is no easy task, since the people all over Germany have been systematically—and successfully—indoctrinated with Prusso-Teutonic ideas. But the job can be done. The spirit of decency and co- operation has been kept alive in Germany, among other things, by the different Churches. It continues to exist below the surface—even more deeply imbedded in the German spirit than the Prusso-Teutonic infection. The Prusso-Teutonics annexed a people—the people of German tongue. They will do everything in their power to hold this people within their circle of damnation: to be damned when they are. Goebbels in his articles and speeches points out regularly that it is vitally important for the entire German nation—not only for the Nazis—to win this war: because if they are defeated, the world will revenge itself cruelly on all of them.

As for the good elements in Germany, they should by all means be encouraged. We should not abandon them to the Prusso-Teutonics.

Many spiritual sources can be tapped in the effort to bring back the majority of the German-speaking people to the common nobility of the Upwa rd Progression. The under- lying concepts should be crysta llized into a theme presented continually and in every possible variation even while the war continues. They should be the basis of a constructive plan for after the war, if the Germ an people are to recognize the appeals made to them as some thing entirely apart from propa- ganda.

It has currently been admitted that we are living in what is called a capitalistic society. This is the assumption from which speculations have started.

We must yield to the evidence that it is not possible to expl ain a series of contemporary phenomena of the utmost importance without going back to their distant sources, some six or seven centuries back. So much the worse for those who do not consider this a serious method of investigation. Pseudo-scientific thought tends to ignore deductions based on the too remote past. It relega tes to the realm of fantasy any reasoning which takes account of factors too far removed. The word \"scientific\" is often reserved for things which are visible or palpable. Materialism, which is in vogue in the study of the social sciences, accepts very little beyond contemporary or closely related factors. To speak of the actual Middle Ages as influencing contemporary events brings a smile to the lips. Thus it is difficult for most people to admit that the role which Germany is playing at this ve ry moment—while possibly not determined by one man all by himself—cannot be explained by the impact of certain great world-wide economic currents either; that it can only be understood by the disclosure of an entanglement of interests exte nding back to the Middle Ages. This entanglement has developed a monster-like existence through the course of centurie s but it has always carefully hidden its true face. We do not intend to deny he re the practical and experi- mental benefits which may be derived from a materialist approach to history.

Furthermore, the school known as that of \"historical ma- terialism\" has specialized in re vealing certain shortcomings of the capitalistic system and the social injustices due to these shortcomings. We have seen the effort toward the actual survival and revival of a much more outdated economic system: the feudal system (and in a certain sense even a pre- feudal system) used to the adva ntage of a small, very re- stricted group. The injustices and sufferings which would spread around the world if their plan succeeded would be a thousand times greater than any injustices of which the cap- italistic system has been accused. It is our opinion simply that the understanding of these phenomena is at the present mo- ment the most urgent task. It is more urgent in any case than the solution of certain problems which used to be the primary object of interest of the \"social sciences.\" We don't believe in the actual survival of the Middle Ages any more than we believe in Santa Claus? But wait! It is use- ful to reread here what Heinrich Heine, writing about his own country which he knew well, said to the French of the nineteenth century. These Frenchmen were unwilling to be- lieve that the Middle Ages, which they thought of as forever past, could still exist beyond their frontiers in the country of Barbarossa, and that some day th is living vestige of the past could penetrate even into France itself. Speaking thus, criti- cizing one part of what he saw and praising another, Heine did not realize that he was ma king himself the spokesman for this German Middle Age which he wanted to condemn. This is what Heine has to say in his book On Germany: \"The French, having emerged from the Middle Ages for some time, can now contemplate them with calm, and can appreciate their beau ties with philosophic or aesthetic detach- ment.

Nothing of it is left for you but the pretty chronicles and the suits of armor. You risk nothing by amusing y our imagination or by satisfy- ing your curiosity in this manner. But we here in Germany, for us the chronicles of the Middle Ages are not yet com- pleted; their most recent pages are damp with the blood of our parents and our friends, and thes e shiny suits of armor protect our living bodies from the blows of our tormenters. Nothing hinders you French from prizing the old Gothic forms. . . . For you, Satan and his infernal companions are only poetry; for us in Germany, there are scoundrels and fools who seek to revive philosophically the belief in the devil, and give credence to infernal crimes of sorcerers. \"You dark scoundrels—and you imbeciles of all shades; do your work; inflame the minds of the people with old super- stitions; drive them wildly along the road of fanaticism; one day, you yourself will become their victims; you shall not escape the destiny which awaits the awkward conjurer who finally cannot master the spir its which he has evoked, and who is torn to pieces by them in the end. \"Perhaps the spirit of revolution cannot stir, by appeal to reason, the minds of the German people; it may possibly be the task of folly to accomplish this great work.

They say that he will remain there in hiding with his entire court, until some time in the future when he shall again appear and bring great happine ss to the German people. These mountains are in Thuringia, not far from Nordhausen. I have gone up there very often, and one clear winter night I stayed up there for over an hour, crying out a few times: 'Come, Barbarossa, come,' and my heart, ablaze, was as fire in my breast, and tears flowed down my cheeks. But our beloved Emperor Frederick did not come, and all that was left for me to do was to kiss the rocks in which he lives. \"Many claim that the Emperor, in his mountain home, sits sleeping in front of a stone table, and dreams of a way in which he can again conquer the Empire. His head nods con- stantly from side to side, and his eyes wink. By this time, his beard reaches almost to the ground. From time to time, as in a dream, he extends his hand as though he were about to take up his sword and shield.

But these old story-tellers add that no one knows exactly when all this is to take place. \"They also tell of a shepherd who was once brought into Kyffhaeuser by a dwarf. On s eeing him, the Emperor arose and asked him whether the crows were still flying around the mountains. And when the shepherd answered in the affirma- tive, the King sighed deeply and said: 'Then it will be neces- sary for me to sleep another hundred years.' \" Thus Heine found charming the very superstitions he in- veighed against. For him, violen tly anti-clerical, the Church was largely responsible for main taining these superstitions of the Middle Ages in Germany. He felt that one day the en- couragement of such beliefs would turn against the Church: \"One day, you yourself will be come their victim. . . .\" Yet he failed to understand thoroughly the dangers inherent in the survival of those purely Germanic superstitions and the legends surrounding the Kyffhaeuser mountain which, to him, were dear. He did not see that some day all this would turn into a terrific diabolical avalanche running away with itself and would end in a nightmarish conflagration spread to all parts of the world. Nor could he imagine that against this orgy of the \"elementary spirits\" the traditions of the Church, based on Christian morality, o ffered a certain resistance and protection. \"The man\" expected by Heine as the future savior of Germany, Barbarossa sleeping in the Kyffhaeuser mountain until the revival of his old empire, were subjects of common tales in Germany for hundreds of years.

None of the various theories of sociology which have inspired Western thought in the last eighty years or so makes possible a complete explanation of what is happening in the world today. On the basis of these theories alone, no one could have predicted the present events. This is due to the fact that most of these doctrines have regarded the evolution of mankind as an organic whole. They have neglected to take into consideration an anachronistic survival of the Middle Ages which for generations has re- mained in the background. Students of important social and economic movements on a world scale seem to have overlooked a series of purely Ger- man phenomena. Each of these phenomena has received at- tention by itself—but the relationship of one to another has not in general been brought out. Thus they have been con- sidered as phenomena or curi osa of local importance only. Heine was conscious of these phenomena although he did not realize what they meant for the future. The world missed the significance of this anachronism almost entirely. Today the same Middle Ages of which Heine spoke have placed themselves very much in the foreground.

And, possibly, the common fight against the same danger may open common avenues of understanding between the two camps. Later we may all perhaps see in a new light the factors behind the struggle in the social field. There are certainly plenty of black spots in the picture of the Upward Progression also. These, however, result from the imperfections of the diffe rent \"Upward\" institutions— whereas, in the case of the Prusso-Teutonics, the characteris- tics we consider dangerous and execrable are virtues according to the standards of the Downward Progression. The Prusso- Teutonic system endeavors to develop barbarous and feudal elements on a world scale. In this endeavor Prusso-Teutonia is perfectly logical from its ow n point of view. The responsi- bility rests on us to act in such a way that they may not succeed. Certain barbarous and feudal elements have survived within the democracies also. But these—which are considered \"per- fections\" in the other camp—here are \"imperfections\" op- posed to the basic tendencies on which the democracies, and the institutions of the Upward Progression in general, have been built. Hitler regularly takes advantage in his propaganda of these imperfections from which we suffe r. In his speeches we have often heard him criticizing flaws within the democratic countries, although he does not mention the fact that the same flaws exist in Nazi Germany to an extent that dwarfs their presence here. We have laughed at such hypocrisy—which is indeed contemptible, according to our moral standards; but Hitler, by acting in this fashion, renders us a real service.

The civilizing influence of the Greco-Christian doctrines has carried on a perpetual hous ecleaning throughout the cen- turies and has gradually been hunting out the surviving \"downward\" elements . Man thought that this process was all that was needed; others believed that it was much too slow. The Prusso-Teutonic danger may speed the process. By turning the spotlight on our imperfections it helps us to elimi- nate them. The democracies are certainly not completely above re- proach. But it is not for them that we are fighting the present war. We are fighting it for a cause much nobler, much wider in scope—the Upward Progression—against these representa- tives par excellence of the Down ward Progression, the Prusso- Teutonics. In this war, by uniting in the same camp all those who, in spite of their imperfections, are basically for the principles of the Upward Progression, we are preparing the way for a much more profound application of these principles in the world which will emerge from the war. We should at least do everything in our power to bring this about. But if feudal privileges have actually survived in many parts of the world, can the Prusso-Teutonic phenomenon be regarded as essentially different from these feudal survivals?

The feudal element itself, so far as it has become one of the component pa rts of Prusso-Teutonism, is much nearer the primitive, non-initiated \"barbaric\" character of its origins than to later-day feudalism. The latter, through the course of centuries, has been very much edulcorated by the civilizing influence of Christianity. It is not the real purpose of Prusso-Teutonism to strive for the introduction in different parts of the world of what is called \"feudal principles,\" alt hough this is what today's feu- dal-minded circles all over the world had at first expected from it. Prusso-Teutonism is interested only in one thing: to establish its own absolute rule over all other countries, com- pletely self-centered, without the slightest consideration for the rights and needs of others. This neglect of the rights of others also applies to those of feudal circles in other countries. English feudal concepts have played some part in shaping the conduct of British internal and external affairs. In spite of this influence on their political life the English have success- fully carried to the different parts of the world extremely valuable ideas of political and economic freedom, deriving from their essentially Chri stian concept of life. The survival in France of isolated feudal-minded groups was responsible for the undermining of the French Republic and for the tragic subjection of a now feudally governed France to the sad ruie of Berlin. But the feudal ambitions of these French circles are concerned with internal rather than external economic and political matters. They have not the ruthlessness of the Prusso-Teutonics, nor are their ambitions directed toward world conquest. In this case feudalism has produced much more modest results, because it did not rest on the conspirational aims of a stri ctly organized Order.

Nothing similar to the conspirational character of the Teu- tonic Order—and later of Pru sso-Teutonism—ever arose in any other Western country. It is this character of conspiracy, aiming at world conquest and subordinating all moral con- siderations to this aim, which gives its unique character to Prusso-Teutonism, even when compared to feudal survivals in other countries. Of course these feudal survivals in many places, including America, constitute a certain danger. We have seen such feudal circles becoming the temporary allies of the Prusso- Teutonics when they imagined, in their short-sightedness, that Germany's masters had no other purpose but to produce a world satisfactory to their desires. Unfortunately there is still much thinking along these lines. As said before, when the war is over it will be useful to give some thought to these isolated feudal survivals. The problem of Prusso-Teutonism is, howeve r, of a basically quite dif- ferent character. It is a prob lem represented by a well-con- cealed, well-organized conspiracy with all its ramifications— all of them subordinated to its own egotistic, super-imperial- istic purposes. It is only their own cause which matters to the leaders of this conspiracy—not the cause of feudalism, collectivism, or any other cause. To root out this conspiracy will be quite a problem. At present its leaders have no doubt that the conspiracy will survive and emerge from this conflict with definite gains— even in the case of a German defeat.

What the future social and economic adjustments evolving from our common inspiration will be, it is too early to say. It is by no means certain that these developments will move in a \"collectivist\" direction as many expect.

No outside condition helped more to bring the Prusso-Teutonic abscess to the point where it endangered the whole world than the different \"isolations\" within the politi- cal and economic body of Europe. A great number of these \"iso lations\" were deliberately engineered by the Prusso-Teut onics. Others, stimulated by the example given, followed—to the great pleasure of the Prusso-Teutonics. The latter, artfully making good use in their tactics of internationally accepted diplomatic concepts, shut off now this, now that part of the European blood stream, thus helping along the growth of an abscess which they them- selves had created. Without the successful application of these ligatures to the political and economic arteries of Europe, the Prusso-Teutonic abscess would have been washed away by the blood stream. Bismarck and his friends stood in the way of the creation of a German empire and the fusion of their own country, Prussia, with this empire so long as the healthy elements in the other German countries were in a position to exert stronger influence within the em pire than themselves.

When, in the period after Bismarck's re- gime, Chancellor von Caprivi tried to integrate Germany into the normal European commercial system he encountered the violent opposition of the entire Prusso-Teutonic clique. Then later, between the two world wars, Dr. Schacht methodically carried forward List's plan: by isolating Germany econom- ically from the rest of the world until the economic suffer- ing deliberately created might re sult in a political explosion and a march of conquest. All this can be a lesson to us. The actual settlement of the German—or rather the Prusso-Teutonic—problem no doubt will have to take the form of an extremely energetic police operation with provisions of a lasting character against the recurrence of the ominous phe nomena. But no police opera- tion can be a real solution of the problem in the long run un- less the general conditions which made possible the abuses are also modified.

A. and elsewhere which have rhe effect of ligatures obstructing the healthy circulation of the world: high tariffs, bans on export an d import, measures against migration, etc. * \"Isolationism\" before the war meant simply the desire to keep America out of war. Today it means striving for a negotiated peace. We ourselves use the term in the following discussion to mean disapproval of all participa- tion in world affairs."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"352 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY \"Isolationism is the enemy\" in all countries because it is the necessary condition for the preservation and the regrowth of sickening \"abscesses\" of the Prusso-Teutonic type. The expressions \"isolation\" and \"iso lationism,\" are employed to designate phenomena of many different types; but the wide- spread use of the same term is not simply due to coincidence. And to the extent that these \"isolations\" act as ligatures on the normal circulation of the world body we are concerned here with all of them. We can use the same expression, \"isolation\" in, among others, the political, economic and demographic spheres. In every case the development it de scribes is dangerous for the same reasons. And in all these spheres \"isolation\" may assume what might be called an \"introverted\" or an \"extroverted\" form. Let us pass these spheres and forms rapidly in review. Political Isolation 1. Introverted form: the \"isolationism\" familiar in America —the tendency or effort to k eep one's own country separated from the rest of the world. 2. Extroverted form: the attempt to \"isolate\" a foreign country—or several—from others through the artificial cre- ation of irreconcilable mis understandings between them by the skillful use of propaganda. For instance, Bismarck's \"iso- lation\" of Denmark, Austria and France; Hitler's diplomatic tactics, etc. Economic Isolation 1. Introverted form: the effort to isolate one's own coun- try economically from the rest of the world in order deliber- ately to create economic misery within the country and thus to keep the pressure up in the political boiler. For example: Prusso-Teutonic and Nazi sc hemes between the two world"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"APPEND IX 353 wars, List's and Dr. Schacht's policies of economic isolation from the rest of the world. 2. Extroverted form: the attemp t to isolate other countries from the rest of the world economi cally by making it difficult for them to export and import. Methods employed: high tar- iffs, dumping, commercial treaties intended to injure particular nations, etc. Almost all countri es, including America, have done this in the past. There have also been classic examples of extreme and pernicious protecti onism in the small independent nations, created in Eastern Europe after World War I. Eng- land deserves great praise for having maintained its economic liberalism until recent years, in opposition to the economic isolationism of almost all th e other parts of the world. Demographic Isolation 1. Introverted form: tendency to impede or block off the immigration into one's country of people obliged, for vari- ous reasons, to quit other countri es. This sort of isolation increases the pressure for expansion—the growth of the ab- scess—in overpopulated countries. After World War I, the United States itself fell into this error, although its own greatness and prosperity are due primarily to its earlier sys- tem of free immigration. 2. Extroverted form: tendency for a country to keep its expatriates permanently under its own influence and to isolate them in mentality from their present surroundings. Such iso- lation makes possible the use of expatriates as tools of the country's own plans of conquest. For example, the artful maintenance of allegiance to th e \"Fatherland\" of German and Japanese immigrants and their descendants within all coun- tries including America. We realize, of course, that all these \"isolations\" and \"isola- tionisms\" are of extremely varied character. They stem, how-"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"354 THE THOUSAND-YEAR CONSPIRACY ever, from roughly the same sort of mentality; and m any event their supporters usually re semble each other like peas in a pod. Further, they all contribute to the creation of condi- tions which favor the growth of abscesses like the Prusso- Teutonic. We do not mean that the Nazi danger is due primarily to such isolationisms. The primary cause of the Nazi danger is the centuries-old Prusso-Teutonic conspiracy, a phenomenon which, in itself, has extremel y deep roots. Furthermore the various types of isolation have often been deliberately stimu- lated by the Prusso-Teutonic clique to create the proper soil for their own aims. But even when, in other cases, the error of isolation was committed by the various peoples of the world of their own free will, this error was frequently seized upon by the Prusso-Teutonics to further their own design. The important factor was the desi gn itself: an organized con- spiracy which has evolved through the years from the thir- teenth century until the twentieth. Nevertheless the pernicious eff ect of the various isolations should not be forgotten. And Am erican leadership—which is essential for a settlement of world affairs in the spirit of Up- ward Progression—should be inspir ed by a sincere desire to end these isolations. To achieve this it will be necessary to make enduring provisions for the greatest possible freedom of circulation in all spheres and on a world-wide scale. People must understand that such meas ures have significance beyond their immediate practical advantages—significance in the fact that they provide one essential guarantee against recurrence of the evil which has caused our present troubles. \"Liberalism\" will have to reach new heights—as a natural enemy of all material and ment al isolations. The word Liber- alism is not used here in a sectarian sense. We speak rather about the true liberalism—i.e., that which frees the world- body of all sickening and paralyzing ligatures.

But in an age in which airplanes will make it possible to commute between Europe and America several times a week and in which goods will be shipped in large quantities from continent to continent by ultra-rapid aerial transports, it will be a necessity. Economic liberalism, political liber alism, intellectual liberal- ism—all are of the same essence. Their importance increases to world proportions with the immense technical advances by which distances are shortened. Facilities of transportation and of communication have always tended to break down existing isolations. Such facili- ties have always been the natural vehicles of \"liberalism.\" The recent tremendous stimulus to transportation and com- munication—in part a result of the war—should bring forth a new era of liberalism, more far-reaching in consequence than anything we have known before. We would not take seriously t oday a suggestion to separate the East from the Middle West or the individual Stares of the union by customs-barriers, moneta ry differences, bans against change of residence and simila r \"isolationist\" measures. Un- told misery, immeasurable complications, strife and injustice would result from such regul ations. Any American child realizes this. If the advantages of economic a nd political liber- alism within the United States are evident today to everybody they will become equally evident to the world as a whole as a result of this war. The United States with its long expe- rience of economic and political freedom within its boundaries and with its unique racial co mposition seems predestined to assume world leadership in freeing the blood stream of the world. People who speak about American leadership are accused of imperialistic leanings.

But \"leadership\" and \"imperialism\" are not the same: the latter represents a particular use of the former. It is up to the liberal circles of America to be on the alert against all imperialistic aberrations from the course to be taken. Their vigilance is necessary as a guarantee that Amer- ica's leadership will be used not only for her own benefit but also for the benefit of other countries—not for the oppression but for the liberation of other peoples. Leadership understood in this sense is not an unwarranted prerogative for America but an obligation. She must assume it not only in her own interest but primarily for the sake of the Upward Progression. It should lead to a post-war crusade against all tendencies toward \"isolation\"—all attempts to re- impose the ligatures on the world body. It should be appro- priate to the basic purpose which inspires it: it should be a leadership profoundly liberal-minded, steeped in the best American and Greco-Christian traditions, adherent—on every plane—to principles evolving from the \"dignity of the human person.\" The liberal circles of America instead of fearing American leadership because of its possible results should welcome it: they should contribute to it their best energy and the fruits of their experience. The contribution of liberalism to American leadership will be of the highest importance for many reasons: if, for ex- ample, liberal sources fail to contribute fresh blood to Ameri- can diplomacy the larter is bound to make the same sort of mistakes as those for which many of us have often criticized England—in spite of our love for English traditions of civic freedom and democracy.

England itself today looks"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"APPEND IX 357 to America, to a certain extent, for the leadership which she has exercised during the last hundred years or so. England, despite her great democratic traditions, has committed many blunders in international politics because of her reliance on out-dated diplomatic principles . She has, consequently, lost much of the prestige which the true leader in international matters must possess—but she can still back up American ini- tiative with her invaluable support. France, because of her very old cultural traditions, is today, regardless of her present political misfortunes, the center par excellence of Western civilization. The \"initiation\" of the French people dates back to extremely ancient and deep sources. It is probably the resu lt of a superposition of Greek and Roman initiative teachings on the Celtic groundwork of initiation which itself belonged to the Upward Progression. (The mysteries of the Celtic or Gallic Druids taught the doctrine of transmigration of the soul and others which are characteristic of Upward initiations.) Later the intense Chris- tianization of France kept alive the force and vigor of the original initiation. The collaboration of the highly civilized French people will be essential in the rebuilding of Europe; but France, without American help, will not be able to accomplish this task— because the closeness of the Prusso-Teutonic danger acts in many respects to upset the balance of its public life. Many believe that Russia, if she proves victorious in this war, will have more to say about the reconstruction of Europe than the United States. This question is not a simple one. Let us remark only that United States influence on European affairs and on world affairs in general will depend to a large extent on the sincerity and mental courage of the American people in approaching the world problems of the post-war period.

If the American people and the American leaders have the mental courage to approach these problems in a completely fresh and profoundly liberal spirit, they will have a great deal to say about the reconstruction of Europe and the world. They will have more to say than Russia, at least so far as Europe is concerned, because of the closeness of American and European cultural ties. But should American politics in international matters be guided simply by a dusty cons ervatism, we would witness a dwindling away of America's present very real prestige in different European countries. In this latter case, but only in this case, it would not be surprising for Europeans to turn to Russia for support in the reconstruction of the continent. In the meantime, let us consider Russian Communism with serenity. We are, for our part, not in agreement, on theo- retical grounds, with the econom ic teachings of Communism and with the doctrine of the pr eponderant rights of the State over those of the individual. We believe, however (to prove this would lead us far afield ), that Communism derives from the Upward Progression, as does our own Western philos- ophy of life—although their end-concepts profoundly differ. The differences separating the two, in any case, are not so great, not so fundamental as the difference between them, on the one hand, and Prusso-Teutonism, the barbarous product of the Downward Progression, on the other. We are not advocating any truce with Communism. We believe it is useful to fight out our differences in the future as vigorously as in the past. We can do this, however, with a measure of good faith on both sides, as behooves opponents who have certain common bonds among themselves.

We base this belief on (1) our confidence in the soundness of free initiative as a fundamental economic concept —provided the practices rest- ing on it are brought up to date; and (2) the fact that respect for the rights of the individual answers an inherent and uni- versal human need. Many believe that leadership by any one nation is unneces- sary and that the nations of the world will (or should) be able to settle their affairs simply in some improved League of Nations where the powers of the various States are properly balanced. Another feeling is th at the various small nations which, by their courageous sta nd in the present conflict, have gained the right to be heard in the future will not be willing to accept any outside leadership. We believe, however, that the small European nations themselves will recognize that re sponsible leadership is neces- sary in the reorganization of Europe. The experiment after the last war—of granting the newly born small nations great influence in the affairs of the continent—did not work out well. The ambitions which were unleashed within each small nation led to excesses in economic and political matters.

The result was that they were either consumed by the monster or became its reluctant allies. This past unhappy experience is no inducement for a repe- tition. Opposition to leadership by a single country or nation is chiefly due to the fact that c ountries and nations are usually considered, in external matters, to be mere associations of their citizens for the common protection of private interests. If nations were nothing more, it would be foolish and unjust to grant leadership to any one of them. It would be used exclusively to further the interests of the citizens of a par- ticular State. But nations are not simply associations for the protection of private interests. They often are—and those of compara- tively recent creation usually are—also practical experiments in the direction of a future society: living crystallizations of certain basic ideas and tendencies. This is particularly true in the case of the United States, which has been built entirely through immigration. This country was created out of the common urge for freedom of masses of people, for the mo st part Europeans. America to them meant liberation from \"ligatures\" of all sorts in their homelands—political, economic, religious, etc.; and immigra- tion to this country offered them undreamed of freedom in every field. Whether these immigrants were adventurers, idealists, revolutionaries, starvi ng farmers or laborers, they were all attracted by the same sort of material and spiritual opportunities, and spurred on by the same urge for liberation. If a nation born out of these basic concepts many times reaffirms them in the course of its history, it becomes a power- ful pole of attraction for people in all the different parts of the world to whom the ligatures of their own countries, the isola- tions inherited from the pa st, have grown unbearable.

Other nations have drawn to themselves people who felt the attraction of those nations' id eas in one field or another. Thus the French nation has acte d as a magnet for immigrants who wanted to take advantage of its cultural opportunities and also, since the French Revolution, for others who have been attracted by her traditions of political liberty. The Teu- tonic Order, even before it ha d created a nation, was a pole of attraction for nobles from all parts of Germany who felt a mental kinship with the Teutonic Knights. After the forma- tion of Prussia, the latter country continued to absorb peo- ple of the same type from all the other German countries. They became Prussian who felt Prussian, wherever they may have been born. As a last exam ple, Soviet Russia exercises a comparable attraction on people of various countries who share her ideological aims. We would like to consider the United States, in spite of its imperfections, as the nucleus of a future society organized according to ideas of freedom in all domains. If this should be her role, it would be absurd to assign this nation membership in some international organization of the egalitarian type, un- less some structural opportunity for her leadership were assured. Because this opportunity was lacking—for this rea- son alone and not because of the fancied advantages of isola- tion—the United States did well to decline membership in the League of Nations.
