[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Corporation Filmmakers’ Official Download Edition Winner, 26 international awards, 10 of them audience awards, including Sundance. Torrent Release Date: November 14, 2006 In law, a corporation is a “person”. But what kind of person is it? THE CORPORATION engages in a liv ely, critical exploration of the dominant institution of our time — its inner workings, curious history, controversial impacts, and possible futures. Case studies, anecdotes, and true confessions expo se influences in both the corporate and anti- corporate worlds. With dark wit, footage from pop culture, advertising, TV news, and corporate propaganda, the film illuminates the corporation’s grip on our lives. THE CORPORATION asks: What are the consequences—for human beings, democracy, and the ecology—of granting immense power to a structurally amoral institution, whose overriding priority is to create wealth for its shareholders? As worldwide concern about the growth of co rporate power intensifies, THE CORPORATION canvasses insiders, outsiders, radicals, and conservatives, in 40 interviews with CEOs, whistleblowers, brokers, gurus, and a corporate spy. Why a Download Edition? Filmmaker Mark Achbar explains: “When I discovered that over 500,000 people had downloaded The Corporation, I had mixed feelings. As a fil mmaker and activist, one of my goals is to reach the largest possible audience. So from t hat perspective, it's an astounding success.” “But I also organized the financing of the film and have ongoing obligations to the individuals and public funders that invested in it. THE CORPORATION was a huge undertaking. Over two hundred people helped make the film, the DV D, and website, and worked on the outreach campaign, over a period of 8 years.” “My hope is that people downloading will keep in mind this is not another mega-corp Hollywood product; it's an independently produced film. I be lieve people appreciate what an enormous effort it takes to make a film like THE CORPORATION and will support it, if there’s a reasonably easy way to. So, I decided to release my own top quality download version, but with a short ad promoting the DVD's extras, and a request from me, asking viewers for a little financial consideration to help offset the costs of produc tion and keep our outreach efforts going. We now have a \"contribute\" button on our website, www.thecorporation.com . I hope people will decide to use it, and encourage their friends to as well. Every contribution helps and is deeply appreciated whatever the amount.” You can also send a cheque or money order to: Big Picture Media Corporation 2676 Eton St. Vancouver, BC Canada V5K 1K1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Edition Details 2004 DVD Version. 145 Mins.
