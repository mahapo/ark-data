[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER is a world in which official criminality, driven by bribery and corruption, is the norm among all layers of governance. At the vast intergovernmental level, the Rule of Law does not apply - a state of affairs which is exploited to the full under cover of a facade of hypocritical official rectitude. But at the country level, it is ruthlessly relied upon by corrupt intelligence cadres when it suits their interests - and equally ruthlessly flouted by operatives and officials most of the time, on the cynical basis that 'everyone is doing it'. In pa rticular, 'everyone' is engaged in perpetrating crimes against humanity - in the form of drug- trafficking operations, which are controlled by the competing and simultaneously collabor ating intelligence services of the Great Powers in order to finance their corrupt operations, and to sustain the corrosive and subversive global hegemony activities of the llluminati, of which intelligence communities form, wittingly or unwittingly, the backbone, as th ey consist essentially of esoteric secret societies. This study, then, is about the ra mpant global corruption in high places arising from the free-wheeling, unrestr ained abominations of the sy stem of synarchy - rule by secret societies. Although focused mainly on the United Stat es and Britain, the Author addresses the consequences of official criminalism worldwid e - showing that it flourishes in surprising places, such as the Vatican. He begins by exposing the lie that greets all who enter the Langley headquarters of the CIA; shows how the perverse influence of the occultic secret societies at Yale University has successfu lly institutionalised poisonously reprobate attitudes and mentalities-originating in Germ any-from generation to generation, infecting cadres at the highest levels and influencing the whole of society for the worse; and identifies the links between the Yale synarchy system and the drug trade, which is the primary financing source for the llluminati. In Chapter 4, The Hex of Himmler, the Author shows how the same perverse German influence has corrupted the CIA - and follows this with a documented expose of German Freemasonry (The House of Lucifer). Chapter 6, which is entitled The Angels of Light, shows how the Evil One resides within, and controls, prominent 'religious' organisations, alienating billions from the Way, the Truth and the Life. Chapter 7 - The Synagogue of Satan - exposes the llluminati from historical documents, and paves the way for the Author 's detailed analysis of The Thousand-Year Reich, which German secret 'Black' intelligence, based at Dachau, near Munich, is building on what it considers to represent 'the ruins of the United States'. Accordingly, the identity of our continuing common enemy is clearly revealed. ■"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Memorandum for the non-Christian reader This book is written from the perspective of True Christianity (meaning that the Author accepts, and proclaims, that Jesus Christ is indeed the Son of God, and 'is come in the flesh'). There are two reasons for this. First, it represents the undeniable, but extensively denied, Truth. Secondly, this work, by definition, examines and exposes the Works of Darkness. This cannot and must never be done without the protection afforded, both to Author and Reader, of the Word, Name and presence of Jesus Christ. For those who do not believe, and who deny the truth expressed in verse 1 of Psalms 14 and 53 - 'The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God' - the Author has this request. Please read this detailed expose of contemporary and relevant historical Works of Darkness, both because the study contains intelligence that has hitherto been concealed or misinterpreted, and because the Scriptural references, which are generally spelled out here in full, provide the absolute standard of perfection against which the reprobate evils described herein can only be j udged and properly understood. The Author does not seek to convert anyone: conversion occurs when a person takes the simple step of Faith, which results in the Free Gift of Grace from the Holy Spirit, and is always a matter for the individual, not for anyone else. At the same ti me, the corollary to this fact needs to be understood - namely, that True Christianity is ex clusive, not inclusive, as wayward 'Christian' churches, ever fearful for their worldly survival, have chosen to assert. This becomes crystal clear to anyone reading Scripture: and, who knows, some readers of this work may be encouraged by it to do so. Should this be decided, start with Chapter 9 of John, and the final Chapters of Luke. Use the King James Bible, which has not been adulterated and modified by modern reprobate 'editors', and try to find a One Year Bible employing the King James Version, divided into 365 Scripture readings which take no more than fifteen minutes daily. The Author has done this for eight years, and the experience has changed his life. If, however, the reader cannot 'handle' this for the moment, he or she is urged not to be discouraged. For the Author believes that this work may well assist many to understand the underlying causes of the mess we're in - not least by identifying the hidden perpetrators of serial crimes, including crimes against humanity such as drug-trafficking, a source of the Illuminati's funding. It also addresses certain issues, such as the extensive Jewish Nazi participation in the Holocaust ('Shoah'), which have been carefully obfuscated and 'written out of history'. Since The Order of the Illuminati is Lu ciferian and is engaged in criminal operations worldwide, it seeks by every means available to procure absolute control over the world, on the false assumption that its criminality can thereby be hidden from scrutiny for ever. Finally, it will become clear as this book unfolds that German secret 'Black' intelligence exploits The Order of the Illuminati as its densest, most effective cover. The Abwehr (Nazi) Intelligence Continuum is located, of all places, at Dachau, a name synonymous with death. The secret 'Black' intelligence organisation directing the New Underworld Order offensive is known as DVD - Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. The head of DVD until he fell ill in 1976 was Admiral Canaris. British intelligence sources inform the Author that the present actual head of DVD is George Bush (Busche) Sr. (2006). Dr Henry Kissinger may have served briefly as de facto DVD Chief while George Bush Sr. doubled as Director of Central Intelligence. ■"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Curse of Criminalism DARK ACTORS PLAYING GAMES The Luciferian German Fascist- llluminati Criminal Revolution Conspiracy to Control the World By means of A global coup d'etat by instalments Christopher Story"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER V This work is dedicated to the memory of: The late Andrew ('Andy') Stephenson who was murdered by agents of the Illuminati in 2005, in retaliation fo r his tireless work in exposing the manipulation of electronic voting equipment and software, ahead of the 2004 Election.

From 1959 to 1961 he worked as a public relations officer for a large corporation in Montreal and Toronto, return ing to Britain in 1961. After several years of free-lance writing he founded his own publishing company in 1963, and has been engaged in writing and publishing ever since. His main seria ls and journals corporation, World Reports Limited, publishes intelligence journals and news letters for the international financial community and for certain specialist readerships. Global Analysis Limited publishes the newsletter Global Analyst and provides specialist strategic consultancy services. His book publishing company, Edward Harle Limited, specialises in 'politically incorrect' - i.e., 'correct' - books such as the present work [see book website: www.edwardharle.com]. He testified before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Scientific Planning, Analysis and Cooperation of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Scien ce and Technology in September 1 978, on 'Saudi-American Finances'; and in Septem ber 1981, he testif ied again, before a Subcommittee of the House Comm ittee on Government Operations, on 'Petroliquidity and the US Treasury's International Financial Policy'. In 1967, he married Janet Rooney, who is from Adelaide, Australia, and they have four grown-up daughters and one (new) granddaughter. ■ ABOUT EDWARD HARLE LIMITED Edward Harle Limited, using Christopher Story's two middle names, specialises in publishing classic intelligence books which serve the purpose of exposing the lies and deceptions of corrupt governments, intellig ence services and institutions in today's oppressive environment of criminalism (the hegemony of organised criminal operations to realise the potential of strategy and to enrich the perpetrators and their corrupt institutions). The co mpany's titles reflect the ugly reality that all the main governments are controlled by Dark Forces - resident within revolutionary intelligence communities which are in control, out of control, and need urgently to be brought under control. The best intelligence officers are well aware of the scale of this crisis and, in both the United States and Britain, are confr onted with the serial evils perpetrated as permissively by domestic intelligence sect ors, as by their foreign competitors, with which they may routinely collaborate. The da rk, oppressive world that these people inhabit, which is riddled with Freemasonry a nd riven with internal hatreds, tensions, rivalries and threats (in both Britain and America), spills over into the 'visible' world of ordinary, defenceless people, and pollutes governance at every level. Our intelligence books seek to shed light into the dark corners of this 'hidden world' - which now affects every facet of our five s. Truly, the intelligence communities of the world are to blame for the mess we're in, and for the chaos that they seem to specialise in generating. This is not to say that there are not 'white hats' who try, against massive odds, to inculcate sense into the maddened skulls of these pe ople: and Christopher Story is privileged to know a few of them. It may be f ound mat these works are uncompr omising in their logic - which is the whole point. If you require 'san itised' and often confused disinformation, why not rely upon the 300+ known US Information Warfare websites which distort facts, libel good people and 'play games' w ith our minds for evil purposes? But if you prefer the truth - or our honest attempts to promote it - please give us your support! You can do this by buying our books - or, if you really agree that what we are doing is indispensable, you may care to assist us fi nancially, or with a bequest in your Will. ■"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER CONTENTS VII ACKNOWLEDGMENTS VIII FOREWORD IX Chapter 1 The Langley Lie 1 Chapter 2 The Curse of Yale 33 Chapter 3 The Lure of Drugs 79 Chapter 4 Addendum to Chapter 4: The Hex of Himmler The Frankfurt School 183 254 Chapter 5 The House of Lucifer 259 Chapter 6 The Angels of Light 345 Chapter 7 Appendix 1 to Chapter 7: Appendix 2 to Chapter 7: Appendix 3 to Chapter 7: The Synagogue of Satan A Directory of alleged Il luminati programmers A Directory of Illuminati traps for the unwary The JASON Society of The Order of the Quest 419 517 519 522 Chapter 8 Appendix 1 to Chapter 8: Appendix 2 to Chapter 8: Appendix 3 to Chapter 8: The Thousand-Year Reich The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Mark II The North American Illuminati GULAG system The continuing Soviet Illuminati GULAG system 529 610 612 614 Conclusion The Scissors Strategy 617 Index  To Chapters 1-8  633 Notes and References: The expanded notes and references annotated in the main text are given at the end of each Chapter, not at the end of the book.

Addenda New Underworld Order Insights 661 THE STANDARD OF ABSOLUTE PERFECTION True Christianity is not inclusive, it is exclusiv e. Thus Jesus Christ sp ecifically contradicts all today who, through ignorance and perversity, preach the false gospel of multi-faith inclusive-ness. As Peter, 'filled with the Holy Spirit', said boldl y to the rulers and elders of the people in Jerusalem (Acts, Chapter 4, verse 12): 'Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved'. It is by the name of Jesus ONLY that the devils are cast out. Therefore, the Author boldly asserts throughout this study the certainty and reliable eternity of the Word of God through Jesus Christ. Since this investigation concerns the Works of Darkness, it contrasts those works with the light and simplicity that is in Jesus Christ It is, after all, 'that old serpent, the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world'. This stance is not intended to be provocative - although that may seem to be the case, to those who believe in neither God nor the Devil - but rather to delineate th e standard of absolute prefection against which the exposed evils can only be judged. ■"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"VIII THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Author is constrained by the infernally compartmentalised environment of the vast and oppressive US intelligence community from openly acknowledging the assistance and inspiration given to him by distinguished 'white hats' among their number - brave professional people who prefer the Rule of Law to open-ended gang warfare and whose bitter experiences have led them, in most of the cases that I have in mind, to acknowledge that there is but one source of Truth - namely, Jesus Christ, 'who is the Son of God and is come in the flesh'. Inevitably, this understanding sets up tensions between the evil deception standards of the corrupt intelligence communities, and the standards required of those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and recognise that it is only by His name that we are saved - and by no other means. The Author came to understand this truth definitively after his late friend Malachi Martin taught him the simple truth that evil spirits are cast out exclusively in the Name of Jesus Christ If Malachi had not sadly died suddenly on 27th July 1999, we would certainly have 'cracked this' together. That Jesus is the only Name that Evil Spirit obeys was first made manifest when the man possessed of many devils who roamed naked among the tombs in the country of the Gadarenes 'saw Jesus afar off, and... ran and worshipped Him. And cried with a loud voice, and said: 'What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not'. For he [Jesus had] said unto him, Come out of Him, thou unclean spirit'. Jesus then asked Evil Spirit's name - since in exorcism, the demons must be identified by their names. 'And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many'. In response to the devils' request that Jesus cast them out into a herd of 2,000 swine who were feeding on the slopes, Jesus consented; and 'forthwith ... the unclean spirits went out, and entered [appropriately] into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea... and were choked in the sea' [Mark, Chapter 5, verses 6-13]. Note that the previously possessed madman 'ran and worshipped' Jesus having 'seen him afar off' - which teaches us loud and clear that the devils know Him (as is further revealed elsewhere in the New Testament, for instance in James (the brother of Jesus) Chapter 2, verse 19: The devils also believe, and tremble'). For, as this book elabor ates, the 'principalities and powers' herewith exposed are not atheists. On the contrary, they believe in Satan (or Lucifer), whose specia lity is turning truth inside out and upside down. Hence they know that the name of Jesus is the only Name by which men and women can be saved; and, being bound by Satan, they correctly identify Jesus as their main enemy: Jesus Belthemitus Maledictus. Jesus Christ is the ONLY enemy of all those exposed in this book. Due to threats specifically directed at t hose who 'speak out' nowadays in the United States, the Author has had to remove acknowledgmen t references to special American friends who have helped him with the development of this work. Such threats are typically perpetrated by telephone, by posting threats on websites known to be visited by the targets in question, by unsolicited emails seeking to entangle the target in polemical discussions for entrapment purposes, by unsolicited third party interventions during telephone conversations, and by other means conjured up by the sick intelligence minds who waste their empty lives 'doing this stuff'. Those who have helped me include several women of special depth, talent and under- standing, the like and quality of whom I have rarely encountered outside the United States. Their special attributes include a determination to resist by all means at their limited disposal the depredations of those exposed in this book; and they are among those who have demonstrated by their true friendships that the endless duplicity I have encountered among intelligence-related parties is not yet the norm (although it has often fe lt like it). Others include one generous friend from the British Isles who has made his home in America; several senior officers and appalled intelligence officials who have done their best to serve their country rather than the Illumina ti; and a number of researchers and generous helpers who have, I know, assisted me behind the scenes. The fact that I cannot ac knowledge their kindness by naming them is itself indicative of the steepening angle of the slide towards perdition that we face. ■"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER IX FOREWORD THE SUBTERRANEAN MOVEMENT, A.K.A. THE RIVER STYX In March 2003, the Author introduced a special issue of his long-standing financial journal International Currency Review, whic h is devoted in part to exposing hidden official and intergovernmental financia l scamming, with the following passage: 'The great majority of mankind' wrote Machiavelli in 'The Prince', 'are satisfied with appearances as though they were realit ies... and are often more influenced by things that seem than by those that are'. How things have not changed! Early in the 20th century, the English thriller writer , John Buchan, revealed how well he understood this sinister reality: 'Away be hind all the Governments and the armies there was a big subterranean movement going on, engineered by very dangerous people', observed his character Richard Hannay' 1 . 'The ancient Greeks recognised this phenomenon: their image for it was the River Styx - the black underground river that rushes in the depths of darkness to Hades. When we consider what is happeni ng behind the level of perceived reality today, we can appreciate, with awe and r espect, just how inspired and intelligent these ancient people were. This agonised re port is all about the River Styx, which is overflowing its subterranean confines, has erupted to the surface and is flooding all over the West's financial and political institutions. In the United States, the pol itical system is literally drowning in this black flood'. 'Another way of focusing upon what follows is perhaps to think of the following simple model. Let us say that, for the purpo ses of clarification, the 'perceived world' of Presidents, Parliaments, Congresses, Monarchies, judges, courts, businesses, tax collectors, political collectives, trade unions, banks and the stock market, is the 'vertical world'. Within this 'vertical world', relationships are clearly defined. Cabinets are presided over by Prime Ministers, the United States has a Constitution (until it is suspended, anyway) to which American citizens defer, trade unions are led by well- known political agitators, military personnel report to their superiors, businessmen must adhere to a well-understood chain of responsibility, and so on. Relationships are generally overt, well understood, and respec ted. What this special analysis will address is a parallel, hidden 'horizontal world'. Within this secretive, murky environment, relationships exist which ruthlessly cut acr oss those prevailing in the overt, 'vertical' world. The relationships and linkages prevailing in the horizontal world are largely unknown to the inhabitants of the 'vertical world\". 'Because the two often clash, inexplicable developments may occur in the 'vertical world' which defy rational explanation. An obvious contemporary example was the Bush Administration's fixation first with Afghanistan, following 9/11, and its 'subsequent' fixation with 'dealing with' Ira q. In fact, detailed plans to 'address' Afghanistan were discussed be tween Russian officials and their American counterparts at meetings held in Washington on 1-2 August 2000, while President Clinton remained in office. As for Iraq, President George W. Bush campaigned in part on a promise to 'take 'em out', and within hours of his inauguration, reports from Washington indicated that the new Administration would 'look for a radical approach in dealing with Iraq'. A declassified paper showing that planning for a 'post-Saddam"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"X THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Iraq' was the subject of a National Security Council meeting held on 31st January 2001, just days after President George W. Bush Jr's inauguration. Therefore, the offensive against Iraq never had anything to do with 9/11, either'. '... The power of the 'River Styx' dime nsion is now such a dangerous incubus worldwide - that is to say, its flooding of our institutions has reached such disturbing proportions - that it is the duty of the an alyst who seeks the truth at all times, to penetrate behind the veil in order to try to make sense of what is happening 2 . Normal reportage is inadequate a nd semi-redundant, because it takes no account of what is going on behind the curtain of the Wizard of Oz. If some of what follows is uncom- fortable reading, this does not reflect a desire for prurience. The Author recognises that we are certainly enjoined and sternly warned (Biblically) not to consort with the darkness - i.e., not to attend a Black Mass out of i nquisitiveness, for instance. But a dispensation exists in respect of those who would seek to place a candle in the darkness - the miracle of which is that by this single small act, the dark recesses are illuminated (in the genuine, rather than the esoteric, sense). THE 'ORDER' TO BE IMPOSED BY THE NEW WORLD - BY 'THE ORDER' Sophisticates may rightly assert that ther e is nothing new about any of this. The history we were taught in school (before national history was completely abolished by the manipulators) was already so sanitise d as to leave us not just ignorant about how power is exploited and controlled, but brainwashed as well. Some who may prefer the relative comfort of leaving their heads in the sand even insist that because 'this is the way things are and have always been', it is a waste of time exposing the evils reviewed, for instance, in this work. By extension, it can reasonably be argued that the title of this book is perhaps misleading, because the 'New World Order' global scam is nothing new. And in one sense, this is true. But any such criticism fails to take accou nt of the real meaning of the slogan 'New World Order'. The World Revolution is not actually about establishing a 'new form' (to cite Lenin) of 'world order', but rather about the 'Order' which is to be imposed by the New World - by which is meant the United States, which is the military enforcement arm of The Order. The word 'Order' is a tell-tale clue as to what is really happening. All secret socie ties using 'The Order' belong to the Illu- minati, which in turn is the primary manifestation of a shadowy 'Order of the Quest', dedicated philosop hically to maximising 'hum an happiness' without God. The Jesuits call themselves The Order. Opus Dei refers to itself as The Order. The Yale-based Skull and Bones is The Order. The even more reprobate Ordo Templi Ori-entis styles itself The Order. Scratch around for secr et societies labelled 'The Order', and you will immediately see the significance of the word 'Order'. Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, a former Cistercian monk who was excommunicated because of his homosexual activities and who flew an occult swastika a bove his castle in Austria in 1907, founded the Ordo Novi Templi ('Order of the New Temple') which specialised in merging Luciferian occultism with violent anti- Semitism. According to the Austrian Psychologist Wilhelm Daim, Lanz was the 'father' of National Socialism' 3 - an assessment which falls short of the reality that Fascism was developed many years earlier on behalf of the Illuminati by one of the 'two Karls' - Professor Karl Ritter, of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XI Frankfurt University (the other Karl, of c ourse, being Karl Marx, who was briefed to elaborate the dialectical 'antithesis' to Fasc ism - Communism, first tried out in Paris). According to Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, 'the \"SS\" symbol was originally used by Guido von List, a close associate of Lanz, who formed the Guido von List Society in Vienna in 1904. The Guido von List Society was accused of practicing a form of Hindu Tantrism which featured sexual perversion in its rituals. This form of sexual perversion was popularised in occult circle s by a reprobate British intelligence officer named Aleister Crowley who, according to the Hitler biographer J. Sydney Jones, enjoyed \"playing with black magic and little boys\". List was accused of being the Aleister Crowley of Vienna. Like Lanz, List was an occultist; he wrote several books on the magick principles of rune letters (f rom which he chose the \"SS\" symbol). In 1908, von List \"was unmasked as the leader of a blood brotherhood which went in for sexual perversion and substituted the swastika for the cross\". The Nazis borrowed heavily from List's occult theories and r esearch. List also formed an elitist occult priesthood called the Armanen Order, to which H itler himself may have belonged' 4 . THE ILLUMINATI ALMOST ALWAYS OPERATE UNDER FALSE FLAGS This further Order, like all the myriad other secret societies using the term 'Order', either overtly or covertly, to denote their status, belonged therefore to the system of synarchy (rule, or intended rule, by secret societies) developed by the revamped (Order of the) Illuminati - which was first exposed by the former Illuminist, Professor John Robison, of Edinburgh University, in his classic work 'Proofs of a Conspiracy ' (1798). These innumerable secret societies represented, and represent today, cells and cadres of the Illuminati who, their Jesuit-trained Jewish 18th century re-founder, Professor Adam Weishaupt, decreed, must always operate under false flags, so that official opposition to and penetration of the llluminati is permanently frustrated. Working to instructions from the Rothschild Family, Weishaupt 'devised', Professor Robison explained, 'an ingenious vehicle for world conquest - a secret Order - which would prove immensely attractive to other mentally superior beings of a similar frame of mind. He called it the llluminati Order, and grafted it, at selected points, onto Freemasonry - like a fungus'. Freemasonry was to be the primary host for this parasitical secret globalis t organisation. 'The Order of the Illuminati' - promoting 'free-thinking' and every abomin ation from self-murder (suicide) to abortion and paedophilia on the basis of the motto of 'Do as Thou Wilt' later promulgated by Crowley, one of its blackest offspring - 'appears as an accessory to Freemasonry' 5 . Freemasonry was selected for this task by Weishaupt because of its established system of Lodges, its initiations by secret ri tual, and its structure designed to entice and indoctrinate successive generations of dupes into and through its ranks. Once enticed into this nexus, those rising up the initiation ladder in and beyond the three basic 'Blue Degrees', where the exploited M asonic masses congregate, are exposed to occultic and demoniac activities and accordingly open themselves up to infestation or even to possession by evil spirits. As taught by the Jesuits - among whom Weishaupt, though of Jewish extraction, was educated - all members of The Order, and of its sub- Orders, would spy on each other in perpetuity."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"XII THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Certain 18th century Germ an Masonic Lodges, Robison reiterated, 'were the nursery or preparation-school for another Orde r of Masons, who called themselves the Illu- minated, and... the express aim of this Order wa s to abolish Christianity, and overturn all civil Government.... The Order was said to abjure Christianity.... Sensual pleasures were restored to the rank they held in the Epicurean philosophy. Self-murder (suicide) was justified on Stoical principles'. Abortion was to be encouraged, given the sexual licence secretly advocated by The Order. And all manner of subtle, gross deception devices, 'inventions of evil things' [Romans, Chapter 1, verse 30], abomin ations and scamming and entrapment tech- niques, with which students of the oppressive intelligence communities are only too familiar these days, were to be developed. One of Weishaupt's closest associates, criminal court Judge Zwack (Weishaupt's Illuminati correspondent 'Cato'), laid these plans out in a document dated 1778, cited by Professor Robison. They included a proposal for the establishment of wife-swapping, woman-sharing and prostitution arrangements, controlled secretly by Illuminati Brothers: 'It will be of great service, and procure us both much information and money, and will suit charmingly the taste of many of our truest members, who are lovers of the [female] sex'. And given that the esse nce of Illuminism is dialectical double- mindedness, not least to maximise confusion among the 'profane', 'it should consist of two classes, the virtuous, and the freer hearted (i.e. those who fly out of the common tract of prudish manners); they must not know of each other, and must be under the direction of men, but without knowing it. Pr oper books must be put into their hands, and such (but secretly) as are flattering to their passions'. 'INVENTORS OF EVIL THINGS' [ROMANS, CHAPTER 1, VERSE 30] Professor Robison's account of Zw ack's revealing report continued: 'There are, in the same handwriting, descriptions of a stro ng box, which, if forced open, shall blow up and destroy its contents; several receipts for procuring abortion; a composition which blinds or kills when [i t is] squirted in the face; a sheet, containing a receipt for a sympathetic ink; tea for procuring abortion (Herbae quoe habent qual-itatem deleteriam); a method for filling a bed-chamber with pestilential vapours; how to take off impressions of seals, so as to use them afterwards as seals (forgery); a collection of some hundreds of such impressions, with a list of their owners, prin ces, noblemen, clergymen, merchants, etc; a receipt ad excitandum furorem uterinum; a manuscript entitled 'Better than Horus'. It was afterwards printed and distributed at Leipzig Fair, and is an attack and bitter satire on all religion... also a dissertation on suicide. N.B. His sister-in-law threw herself from the top of a tower. There was also a set of portraits, or characters, of eighty-fi ve (loose) ladies in Munich; with recommendations of some of them for memb ers of a Lodge of Sister Illuminatae; also injunctions to all the Superiors to lear n to write with both hands; and that they should use more than one cipher' 6 . In this description we can see the ancestors of familiar contemporary intelligence sector abominations. 'In the Illuminised German Lodges, death was declared [to be] an eternal sleep; patriotism and loyalty were called narr ow-minded prejudices, and incompatible with universal [fake, cold] benevolence; while continual declamations were made"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XIII on liberty and equality as the inalienable rights of men. The baneful influence of accumulated property was declared an insurmountable obstacle to the happiness of any nation'... and... 'Nothing was so frequently discoursed of as the propriety of employing, for a good purpose, the mean s which the wicked employed for evil purposes; and it was taught, that the pr eponderance of good in the ultimate result consecrated every mean employed [the end justifies the means]; and that wisdom and virtue consisted in properly determining this balance. This appeared big with danger; because it appeared that nothing w ould be scrupled at, if we could make it appear that The Order could derive advantage from it, because the great object of The Order was held as superior to every consideration. They concluded by saying that the method of education' [in accordance with Luciferian Jesuit principles] 'made them all spies on each other, and on all around them' 7 . The crucial modus operandi of The Order of the Illuminati - a 'superior' secret society in its own right which has over 1.1 million members, bound by Satan, in the United States alone* - has been, ever since its re-founding and 'upgrading' by Weishaupt in Germany, which remains the delegated seat of the Illuminati today -to surround rulers and power-brokers with members of The Order so that 'the profane' - that is to say, those of us of independent mind who, by the Grace of God, have been bypassed by these evil manipulators, to the detriment no doubt of our own careers and prosperity - can never access high places or occupy positions of real authority and power. If, by some accident, any such individual should reach high office and his or her true orientation is unmasked, he or she is targeted for destruction. As Robison explained this methodology (in his late 18th century context): 'The authority of the ruling powers is repres ented as of inferior moral weight to that of The Order. [Weishaupt taught that] \"T hese powers are despots when they do not conduct themselves by [The Order's] principl es; and it is therefore our duty to surround them [rulers] with its [The Order's] members, so that the profane may have no access to them'. This means that those who seek power or possess political ambition but whose souls have not yet been sold to Satan (The Illuminati), have no chance of ever wielding it - making of course a complete nonsense of 'democracy' and 'freedom' which are words that the Illuminati use as slogans to bamboozl e the hoi polloi, whom of course they fundamentally despise. Yes, they tend to desp ise ordinary people indeed - despite all their falsely self-righteous bravado about 't he Brotherhood of Man' (meaning the Brotherhood of Men, i.e., 'the chosen', namely the members of Illuminati secret societies and of Illuminati-penetrated and -controlled Freemasonry). * According to Cisco Wheeler, a former Illuminati mind-control programmer, at least ten million people have been programmed as mind-controlled slaves using Himmlerian and Tavistock Institute-derived trauma-based mind-control programmes with codenames such as MONARCH and MK-ULTRA A m ore recently developed, non-trauma, electronic means of mind-control programming that emerged out of the Montauk Project (after its location on Long Island), may have entrapped millions more. Al Bielek, who was prominently instrumental in developing the Montauk Project, has stated that there m ay also be as many as ten million victims of Montauk-style mind-control programming worldwide, with the majority living in the United States. Bielek is also on record as having revealed that there are covert Montauk Programming 'Centers' in every important city in America. A list of alleged Illuminati programmers, includin g the late Pope, is given on pages 517-518 of the present work. What is usually referred to as 'public opinion' is really carefully crafted and scripted propagand a designed to elicit an intended behavioural response from the general public. Public opinion polls are taken specifically with the covert intention of gauging the public's acceptance of pre-planned Illuminati operations and projects. A strong showing in opinion polls tells the Illuminati manipulators that a given programmin g operation is 'taking', while a poor outcome tells the New Undlrworld Order manipulators that they need to recast or 'tweak', the programming until the desired resp onse is achieved. While the general thrust and content of a given burst of controlled propaganda is decided by the London-based Tavistock Institute, accord ing to sources, implementation of the propaganda in the United States is handled by more than 200 controlled 'think tanks' such as the CIA's RAND Corporation and the Brookings Institution, which are overseen and directed by the leading New World Order control organisation in the United States, the Stanford Research Insti tute (SRI), located at Menlo Park, CA The Author, who has visited the United States frequently every year since 1977, has never - repeat, NEVER - encountered a si ngle 'think tank', lobbying organisation or specialised media outlet that is not controlled in some manner, with an instrumental axe to grind. This grim st ate of affairs has been exacerbated in recent years by the emergence of more than 300 controlled intelligence Information Warfare websites which exist to spread disin formation, propagate confusion and divert attention from questionable or downright evil official policies, so that no-one can fathom what is happening."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XIV THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER And as Professor Robison concluded, citing Weishaupt himself again: '\"Thus we are able most powerfully to promote [The Order's] interests. If any person is more disposed to listen to Princes than to The Order, he is not fit for it, and must rise no higher. We must do our utmost to procure the advancement of Illu-minati into all important civil offices'\" 8 . This objective has long since been attained - so that the 'democratic system' has become a plaything of The Order of the Illuminati, which has hidden behind the 'conspiracy theory' lie for so long that contemporary exposures such as this book have evidently come as a bleak surprise to its crazed leadership. As is well known, anyone who ventures into this undergrowth is immediately excoriated variously as a 'nutcase', a 'maverick' (the word routinely used by brainwashed British journalists to describe colleagues such as this Au thor who don't share their 'slides' 9 - that is, any prefabricated, sterile views they may hold), or a else 'conspiracy theorist'. According to this fatuous perception, there is no such thing as a conspiracy. In denigrating all conspiracies as fantasies by definition, so that further enquiry is thereby precluded, the Uluminati have successfully hidden their own mammoth conspiracy which is of proportions without historical precedent, fr om view: or so they foolishly imagine. Yet Lenin, one of the Illuminati's most notoriously influential agents, explicitly wrote that the World Revolution is a conspiracy. Specifically in 'What is to be Done?'in 'Burning Questions of Our Movement' 10 , V. I. Lenin expounded, with his usual nit-picking language pedantry: '...In form, such a strong revolutionary organisation... may also be described as a \"conspiratorial\" organisation, because the French word \"conspiration\" is the equivalent of the Russian word \"zavogor\" (\"conspiracy\"), and such an organisation must have the utmost secrecy'. This definitively puts paid to the untutored, knee-jerk 'conspiracy theorist' response of the ignorant, the perverse and those with empty heads who prefer the life of the ostrich, to all who seek to expose these serially evil conspirators and their accursed secret societies, mach inations and lies, which are responsible, thanks to the Uluminati's hegemony within intelligence communities, for the deteriorating mess we're in today. The 'conspiracy theory' jibe is the most effective lie of all. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HABOURS KEY ELEMENTS OF THE AGENTUR Yes, intelligence officers hold all the key posts in the West, or control and encompass about those who occupy them - in conformity with the Jesuitical methodology extrapolated by Adam Weishaupt and his synarchy successors. The Uluminati have successfully done their utmost to procure the advancement of members of their vast agentur 'into all important civil offices'. In one letter to a co-conspirator, dated 6th February 1788, Weishaupt wrote that 'in particular, every person' (in, or a candidate for, The Order) 'shall be made a spy on another and on all around him. Nothing can escape our sight [so that] the trustworthy alon e will be admitted to a participation of the whole maxims and political constitution of The Order. In a Council of such members we shall labour at the contrivance of means to drive by degrees the enemies of reason and of humanity out of the world, and to establish a peculiar morality and religion fitted for the great Society of mankind' 11 which of course the Illuminati 'elite' lust without ceasing to control."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XV Specific echoes of this form of idolatry of control, which requires the Illumi-nati conspirators and their agentur to reorder every facet of our existence in vain pursuit of their own security, appeared in the Comm unist literature. For instance, a Soviet tome dating from 1934 contained the follow ing statement, the shorter-term context being the underlying fear that the Soviet system might be undermined from within: 'The socialist society will be forced to ap ply the most resolute measures for a long time (including the liquidation of people who are especially dangerous to the socialist system) against people who are harmful and deliberately destructive to socialist production, i.e. those who seek to undermine the socialist state and to re- establish the capitalist system' 12 . A generation later, the following warning that all must be brought to think alike, appeared in a compendium of Soviet political thought: 'Under Communism, public opinion will become a mighty force, capable of bringing to reason those individuals who might not want to follow Communist customs and rules of behaviour in the community' 13 . The Soviet literature also inadvertentl y revealed the Illuminati's global false culture (mind-mapping) offensive, as for instance in this passage dating from the mid- 1960s: 'Boundless possibiliti es are opened up under Co mmunism for the cultural advancement of mankind.... The cultures of diffe rent peoples, national in form, will be increasingly imbued with the same Communist c ontent. Their drawing together on this basis will provide a mighty stimulus to the mutual enrichment and development of national cultures and in the long run will lead to the formation of a single, deeply international culture that will be truly the [Godless] culture of all mankind' 14 . 'POLITICAL CORRECTNESS': SUBSTIT UTING 'SLIDES' FOR ENQUIRY Hence, it is not hard to trace the Illuminati origins of the contemporary scourge of 'political correctness', which is a mind-control mechanism to substitute 'slides' for original thought and enquiry, on the assumpti on that this will ensure over time that subservient populations become putty in the hands of the manipulators. As a 'beneficial add-on', the Illuminati anticipated that mind-controlled agentur operatives would in due course rise to the top of the pile - a notable example being the young leader of the British Conservative Party (a s of 2006), David Cameron, whose mental- mapping and prior sensitivity training has been so extreme that almost his entire verbal output consists exclusively of vapid, prefabricated ideological 'slides'. In crucial respects, the present work is spiritual, because what we will be examining here are the very 'principalities and powers' that wage war against the Way, the Truth and the Life - th e Word of Jesus Christ, who is their sole enemy. Foolishly, these people imagine that they can and will destroy Christianity - which can never happen, given Christ's assurances to us that 'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world' [Matthew, Chapter 28, verse 20] and 'Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away' [Matthew, Chapter 24, verse 35] - knowing that much of the formal fabric represented by the manm ade Christian denominations is putrid, soggy and rotten, especially the Vatican (and its corrupt daughter churches) which, with the ascendancy of the refounder of the modern mafia, Giuseppe Mazzini, and the establishment of the sovereign Vatican mini-state, became one of two primary political organising centres of the Illuminati's World"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"XVI THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Revolution from 1870 onwards. Mazzini's 'par tner' was the occultist mass murderer and American Civil War criminal, Albert Pi ke, with whom Mazzini 'divided powers', leaving Pike to concentrate on his gobbldegook, magick, the elaboration of Scottish Rite rituals, fake mythology and initiation ceremonies, to invoke spirits, and to plan three great catastrophes. The first two of these mate rialised in the formats of the First and Second World Wars, and the third is unfolding 'as we speak', se tting the Jews against Islam for the 'final' Luciferian conflagration. Pike developed these demonic plans, probably under Satanic influence, at a mansion that he built for himself located in Little Rock, the headquarters today of the Rose Law Firm with which which Mrs Hillary Clinton (codename 'Queen Melusina') is associated. And, as Weishaupt wrote to his correspondent: 'By this plan we shall direct all mankind. In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames. The occupations must be so allotted and contrived, that we may, in secret, influence all political transactions' 15 . 'NONE OF THIS MUST EVER COME OU T' - SCARED U.S. INTEL OFFICER The niuminati require that their black intentions, driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer' 16 , must remain hidden from all investigator s, and from the curious, for all time. In the course of research for this book, the Author has been told by several US niuminati sources that 'none of this must ever come out'. Although this statement was made and repeated in the context of the Author's separate investigations into the Illuminati's hidden financial scamming operations, it was mean t also to be relevant to the subject- matter of this book - which has, of course, necessarily relied heavily not only upon the Author's own research, but also upon the prior work of recognised author ities, including certain Masonic writers who have themselves revealed secrets of the Brotherhood. The warning that 'none of this must ever come ouf was first enunciated by Weishaupt himself, who wrote in a letter cited by Robison as follows: 'There must (a la Jesuite) not a single purpose ever come in sight that is ambiguous and that may betray our ai ms against religion and the state'. 'One must speak sometimes one way and sometimes another, but so as never to contradict ourselves, and so that, with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable' 17 . This is the main underlying origin of the most nauseating characteristic of all dimensions of German-originated Illuminati operations and of all agentur members - their double-mindedness. With certain exceptions, such as Ordo Templi Orientis, which does not even bother to present a 'ben evolent' facade, all Illuminati open and / or secret societies present an outward, beneficial and benevolent face for public consumption, while masking of course their hidden evil purposes. The open, friendly facade (the Vatican is known as the Open Frie ndly Society) is the cynical deception device to divert public a ttention from the real purposes of the organisation's existence. Often it is not hard to identify the underlying nefarious dimension - as is the case, for instance, with the massive networking and mind-mapping operation run out of what was the Office of the (former) UK Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, calling itself 'Common Purpose'. Neither word used in this title is defined, of course, because if the true objectives of this subversive mind-con-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XVII trol nexus were known, it would fail. Its hi dden objective, masked behind a facade of 'sensible'-sounding Aesopian jargon, is to develop a cadre of brainwashed apparatchiks in every key control-sector of British society, in order to minimise, over time, opposition from the lower government, banking, industrial and other structures to the subversive policies being implemented by the Fabian revolutionary British Government. Under the controlled Tony Blair, its entire focus was/is to fulfil the requirements of secret German strategy manipulated through penetrations of the intelligence services - controlled by the German 'Black' intelligence organisation based in Dachau known as DVD (D eutsche Vertei digungs Dienst). Professor Robison wrote further that when a candidate for Illuminated status 'is drawn out of the general mass of Free Mas ons' to become Illuminatus Minor, he is required to sign a document which includes the following binding oath: 'I bind myself to perpetual silence and unshaken loyalty and submission to The Order, in the persons of my Superiors; here making a faithful and complete surrender of my private judgment, my own will, and every narrow-minded [as defined exclusively by the Illuminati, of course] employment of my power and influence... I will conduct myself as required by The Order.... I pledge myself to account the good of The Order as my own, and am ready to serve it with my fortune, my honour, and my blood. The friends and enemies of The Order shall be my friends and enemies...' 18 . GOVERNANCE IN THE TIGHT GRIP OF DARK ACTORS PLAYING GAMES In other words, governance, not least via the tight control exercised on high office- holders by the deeply penetrated intelligen ce communities, is in the hands of a self- appointed sect of very dark operatives w hose will has been forfeited and bound to a Luciferian force. By definitio n, therefore, none of these people can ever respond to the so-called Will of the People - hence the emp tiness of their verbiage - since they are bound by an agenda set by the Brotherhood, which serves its own interests rather than those of the general population, and which seeks global hegemony and control. And the dreadful reality is that the United States is the 'enforcement arm' of The Order, which is to be imposed by the New Wo rld. That this is the case is revealed by study of works by the 33rd Degree Mason and occultist Manly P. Hall, who identified Sir Francis Bacon as the most influential transmission mechanism of the Rosicrucian paganism from which Illuminism is descended, the origins of which have been traced to 14th century Germany. Having concluded th at the 'Old World' - contemptuously referred to by present-day US Illuminists as 'O ld Europe' - was not 'ready' to adopt the pagan 'Ancient Mysteries' for which 'Do as Thou Wilt' is an accurate proxy, Bacon set about promoting the idea that it was to be in the New World that his pagan 'Ancient Mysteries' prescriptions would triumph. Yet it was only in the 1920s that the United States adopted the insignia of The Order of the Illuminati on the most widely used US banknote, the $1.00 bill - reproducing the Luciferian, occultic image which appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. That the reverse of the Great Seal displays the insignia of the Illuminati is a fact of which most Americans, to this day, are ignorant. The insignia was adopted by Weishaupt when he founded The Order of the Illuminati on the 1st May (= the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"XVIII THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Druid pagan feast of 'Beltane') in 1776. It is that event that is memorialised by the inscription in Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI at the base of the pyramid on the insignia - not the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as is commonly but erroneously supposed. The hideous all-seeing eye, which is to be found in all occult 'religions', is also the symbol of the spy system that Weishaupt established under the subtitle of 'Insinuating Brethren' to guard the 'secret' of The Order - namely the intention of destroying Christianity and of establishing a global dictatorship - and to terrorise the population into resigned acceptance of rule by the synarchy (precisely as is happening in the United States and Britain). The Illuminati criminals lust after global control so that they can be protected from exposure and punishment. INSIGNIA OF THE ILLUMINATI US ED EVERY DAY BY ALL AMERICANS This Illuminati secret service 'enjoyed' its first sadistic workout during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. Subsequent elaborations of that abomination included of course the bloodbath and Re ign of Terror that accompanied and fol- lowed the Russian Revolution, the Nazi Reign of Terror and industrialised mur- derous abominations inflicted against Jews and others in central Europe, Stalin's earlier and continuing bloodbaths, and subsequent abominations including US atrocities in Japan (Hiroshima and Naga saki) and Vietnam, US and British abom- inations in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq, the genocides in Cambodia, Ruanda, Zimbabwe and elsewhere, and all wars of the 'enforcement arm' of the Illuminati. Given that they use the insignia of the Illuminati displayed so provocatively on the $1.00 bill in their everyday transactions, Americans prove the conspirators' point that they can 'get away with anything' - or so they belie ve. Despite frequent travelling in the United States since 1977, the Author has never encountered any protest against the manifestly provocative display of this Illuminati symbol on the most widely used American banknote. Nor has the Author ever encountered an American who understood that the words ANNUIT COEPTIS on the insignia can mean 'Our Enterprise' (Our Conspiracy) - a phrase used by President G. W. Bush in 2005 when he referred to 'our vast intelligence enterpri se', a slip of the tongue which clearly confirmed his knowledge (as a controlled oper ative himself, with many handlers) that the implementing structures of the conspiracy are integrated within, and control, the US intelligence community, which in turn controls the US Presidency and all other key institutions and structures. The phrase below, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, meaning the 'new secular' (not social) 'order', proclaims the focus of the conspiracy. The insignia acquired Masonic significance ONLY after the merger of Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati with The Order of Freemasonry at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad in 1782. The ardent Illuminist Thomas Jefferson, together with Benjamin Franklin and John Adams (an ancestor of the Roosevelts), proposed the use of the Illuminati insignia on the reverse of Great Seal, to Congress, which adopted it on 10th June 1782. On adoption of the Constitution, Congress decreed, by an Act of 15th Sep- tember 1789, that the insignia should be retained on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. The obverse image was first applied to the left of the reverse"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XIX of the $1.00 bill by Presidential decision, when Roosevelt launched his 'New Deal' in 1933 19 , coinciding with Hitler's 'coup d' etat by instalments' operation. It is contended by some analysts that Franklin, Adams and Jefferson were not aware of the evil purposes of the Illuminati. The Author does not agree. It is very evident that the American Re volution represented an Illuminati putsch - as is perfectly clear, not least, from the routin e excoriation of George III that one hears in the United States to this day. After all, George III was a ruler who was refusing to 'cooperate' with the Illuminati. In any case, the perception that the American Founding Fathers were ignorant of the Illuminati's nefarious plan s is based upon a misunderstanding of the base nature of the Illuminati ag entur, which, as is reiterated elsewhere in this book, is driven by the Janus doctrine of wearing two faces, one of which is hidden. Thus, it would have been perfectly logi cal for Franklin, Adams, Jefferson et al to have carried out and sponsored an infinite number of good works, while simultaneously espousing nefarious Illuminati activities and strategies. In addition to integrating internal and external es pionage, obsessive secrecy, blood oaths and opportunities for blackmail into The Order's modus operandi, to ensuring the perpetual education of fresh Illuminati cadres drawn from the ranks of the Masonic Blue Degrees, constructively insinuating and installing members of their vast agentur into high places or into the entourage of th ose occupying positions of power, and more recently ensuring that illuminised, geomasonic , controlled intelligence officers occupy the most important state and international positions, the Illuminati further seek always to ensure that they have scope to select evil people - individuals with gross secret blemishes, and especi ally paedophiles - for preference within their dark conspiracy (although this practice is not universally applied). WHY PAEDOPHILIA IS SO COMMONPL ACE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS The reason that paedophilia is especially preferred as a weakness 'qualifying' such a candidate for high office, can only be explai ned in spiritual terms, as follows. Jesus used violent language against those who corrupt, degrade or harm little children, innocents in whom dwells the Holy Spirit: fo r, as He also taught us, the human person is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Specifically, Christ declared that 'whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea' [Matthew, Chapter 18, verse 6]. [And the reason that Masonry is the key vehicle for Luciferian abominations is the little-observed one that, prior to the invention of 'Speculative Masonry', Masons were engaged in building temples (cathe drals) made of stone - an 'unnecessary' activity spiritually, since the temple of the Holy Spirit is the human person]. Given that this is what all who corrupt children and young people deserve, and given that the human person is the temple of the Holy Spirit ('for behold, the kingdom of God is within you' [Luke, Chapter 17, verse 21]), it follows that there can be nothing worse than to subvert and corrupt ('offend' in Jesus' gentle speech) children. In Matthew, Chapter 12, verses 31- 32, Jesus warns: 'Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy agai nst the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"XX THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come'. Since children in general are innocents in whom dwells the Holy Spirit, it is plainly the case that corruption of children, in whatever form, represents blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. And since Satan seeks through his seething powers to maximise the potential for confusion, destruction and chaos, we need not be surprised at the prevalence and high incidence of paed ophilia in high places - of which instances could be cited applicable to both the United States and Britain. Those who corrupt children cannot be forgiven; and, as they are not atheists ('for even the devils tremble, and believe'), they know that they are lost. They have no hope. For most of the time, these people are in denial about this desperate state of affairs; but at night, or when they are alone, or when confronted with exposure, they are all terrified. It has been specifically revealed by a defector from the Illumin-ati that these people are 'all unhappy', and wish that they had never been sucked into the hellish world of the Illuminati. A few may manage against all the odds to develop the strength of character to burst out from what binds them, but they can only do this through repentance and faith in Jesu s Christ: there is no other way. Those who have blasphemed against the Ho ly Spirit, knowing that they are on their way to perdition, seek, therefore, to take as many members of humanity down to hell with them as they can, on the ludicrous working assumption that they will be less lonely in the state of permanent torment that awaits them. They are not atheists. And since they are in this state, they remain obedient instruments of Lucifer, and do his bidding, because they know they ha ve no hope. It follows, finally, that it makes 'sense' for Satan to entice as many ambitious people into the hell of paedophilia as possible, since the ranks of the Illuminati are thereby swelled, and implementation of Satan's lust for global hegemony is promoted accordingly. The single product of Lucife rians is death - spiritual and physical death for themselves, and as many deaths of others as they may acquire opportunities to inflict. In April 2006, 'The Times' (London) publ ished a brief review of 'Laura Bush, an Intimate Portrait of the First Lady', by Rona ld Kessler, a former Capitol Hill staffer who allegedly served the interests, in the back rooms of the Legislative Branch, of those members of the Illuminati who successfully sought to ensure that the use of aspartame would be approved. This substance induces seizures, and is believed to be responsible for the rapid increase in Alzh eimer's and autism (Alzheimer's in turn serving the interests of th e insurance scamming dimension of the Illuminati, based primarily in Indianapolis - since the more patients who spend their final years afflicted by Alzheimer's', the more wills can he malevolently modified, the more estates can be plundered and the more life assurance policies can be stolen and scammed). In hot temperatures, aspartame underg oes a chemical reaction, becoming formaldehyde - explaining the phenome non of Gulf War Syndrome. The vast supplies of Coca Cola containing aspartame that were delivered for consumption by the troops in the Middle East lay for weeks on the tarmac in temperatures of up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The Chief Executive O fficer of Merck, the manufacturers of aspartame, at the relevant time, was Donald Rumsfeld. Merck later acquired Monsanto, suppliers of the ingredients for aspartame 20 ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XXI THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND BLOODLUST According to \"The Times\" review of Kessl er's book, Mrs Laura Bush 'gives him the \"greasy eyeball over a flippant or inconsiderate remark or when he failed to show the right kind of courtesy or attention to some one\", in the words of their friend Donald Ensenat. 'She doesn't need to verbalise with him. It registers\". When Mr Bush stated that he wanted Osama Bin Laden (a.k.a. the CIA operative and asset 'Tim Osman') \"dead or alive\", she responded by saying: 'Bushie, you gonna git 'im?\" He took the point, telling friends: \"She didn't want to see me become too be llicose, react with bloodlust\"' 21 . Bloodlust? Where exactly did the 43rd President of the United States get that idea from? On 19th March 2003, as the first news of the attack on Iraq came through, the President was caught on the internal White House video camera punching his right fist into the air, exclaiming: 'Feels good, feels good'. Is this man possessed? Unfortunately, it has been reliably alleged that, at a certain pre- presidential stage of his existence, George W Bush Jr. was ind eed present at an occult ceremony in the course of which an unknown number of persons lost their lives. Death is nothing to the Illuminati. As al luded to elsewhere, the Author himself received no less than seven death threats in the course of r esearching this study. When people fall out of line with the Illuminati, they may be at risk. Certain pop singers, such as Jimmy Hendrix, were inte lligent enough, and insufficiently drugged, to comprehend the Illuminati's permissive so ciety strategy, and in particular its exploitation of the 'music' industry to propa gate the sterile, Luciferian idolatries of mind-control, sex and death. When Hendrix started to insert lyrics in his 'songs' that revealed his understanding of what was going on, he was liquidated. The Illurninati are particularly focused on attacking the children of their targets, especially if they are twins (they have an occultic fixation on twins, and on twin boys aged 11). 'UNHAPPY' COWARDS AND BULLIES These people are capable of anything. The tw o most heinous Illuminati regimes to date have of course been Stalin's USSR, and Nazi Germany (sample atrocities of which are displayed on page 658). But by far the worse Illuminati regime ever to have been developed in human history may be emerging 'as we speak'. It is the United States. As one European friend of the Author, long resident in the United States, has explained: 'The Nazi/Illuminati dictatorship th at will emerge in the United States will be by far the worst that mankind has ever perpetrated'. This study seeks to help delay or even to neutralise any such Luciferian outcome. Just as these evil people are all 'unhappy', it should also be borne in mind that they are cowards and bullies. The Author discovered this personally when, having delivered a lecture on Soviet strategy at the East Side Conservative Club in the Plaza Hotel in New York in December 1995, he mist akenly allowed a certain Soviet, who was an emigre from Stalin's entourage, to ask the first question. This operative strode in his dirty raincoat to the lectern, elbowed the Author out of the way, and proceeded for 12 minutes to denounce everything that the Author had said. When finally the Author regained the lectern, he uttered three sent ences, which he has never been able to recall. It appeared that the wo rds were not his. Jesus said: 'But"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"XXII THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost' [Mark, Chapter 13, verse 11]. Certainly, the effect was that the Soviet operative visibly shrank into his chair as the whole hall erupted in a standi ng ovation lasting for several minutes. But the words were not those of the Author. One should never deliberately set out to to confront evil. But when confronted with evil - which is different - standing up to these cowards and bullies from a rock-solid position of integrity, causes them to fall b ack. Consider what happened when Jesus confronted the band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees brandishing weapons after Judas had betrayed Him: 'When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the pl ace; for Jesus oft-tim es resorted thither with his disciples. Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, co meth thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Je sus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground'. [John, Chapter 18, verses 1-6]. NONE CAN WITHSTAND THE POWER OF JESUS CHRIST Quite simply, the power of Jesus Christ is greater by far than all the destructive power of these deluded contem porary disciples of Satan: 'And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth' [Matthew, Chapter 28, verse 18]. This means that if, in His Name, we refuse to be bamboozled by their lies, by their manipulations of the truth, by the games they play with our minds, by the scams and deceptions they perpetrate, by their false promises and blandishments, and by their sterile posturings, threats and empty words, they will he unable to achieve their objectives. In this connection, it should be stressed that one of their most effective weapons is our own sense of their overwhelmingly oppr essive power and the consequent sense of helplessness that it is intended to impose upon us. This psychological intimidation should be resisted. Because although they believe they are winning, that is a delusion. They are all headed for perdition; and they know it. The American Republic can be saved. It can be wrested from the hands of these amoral, serial criminalists. The 'white hats' in the intelligence community, and their colleagues and supporters throughout the US structures, can perfectly well summon up the collective will to terminate the reign of these people, to face them down, and to cease relying exclusively upon the pro bono activism of private foreign friends of the United States, for th e progress that needs to be made. The Author believes in 'the power of one'. Even one person, properly guided and motivated, can achieve decisive results, as the Author has been able to do in connection with certain key developments not addressed (for security reasons) in this study.

For, as indicated, the end that these Luci ferians face, and their sole product, is death. That they are cowa rds was illustrated by the fo llowing account of the final moments in the life of one of the flluminati's most odious creations, Stalin's Interior Ministry chief, Lavrentii Beria, who, as th is investigation reveals, was the German Abwehr's highest-level long-range penetra tion agent in Moscow. The account is taken from a description of Beria's execution attributed to the KGB officer Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, who may have been present at it, or even Beria's executioner: 'Nosenko claimed that he was one of the agents who had arrested Lavrentii Pavlovich Beria, the man who had been Stalin's chief executioner during the mass exterminations of the prewar purges. As head of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), the predecessor of the KGB, Beria had masterminded perhaps the most-feared secret police agency of its day. Thousands, maybe millions, died at his orders. But, according to Nosenko, when given a pistol and told to shoot himself, Beria cried uncontrollably, clutching at the boots of those who tried, in vain, to convince him to \"do the honourable thing''. Beria was finally shot by one of his captors' 22 . AFTER THEY DELIVER DEATH, THEY BECOME POSSESSED This is a gruesome illustration of the fundamental cowardice of these people. When it comes to their own demise, they tend to see death in a different light -having all their possessed lives 'believed' in the Satanic lie of reincarnation (taught by The Order). There was, however, no sign in the spring of 2006 that the leader of the enforcement arm of the Illuminati had entertained any second thoughts over the ease with which he had presided to date over the delivery of death. After Lady Thatcher had long been forced out of office, the Author met her at a birthday party held, appropriately enough, at the Tower of London. It was 13 years after the sinking of the Argentine warship, the Belgrano, which she had ordered, with substa ntial loss of life. Instead of the blue eyes that the Author had noticed when he had first been invited to advise her in March 1979, he saw before him a woman who se eyes were blazing jet black. Several Members of Parliament separately reported to the Author that the identical phenomenon had been observed, from time to time, with respect to the eyes of the subsequent British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Two American women reported separately to this Author in the early 1990s that they had noticed with alarm, while in his presence at events in Washington, that the physical temperature surrounding MVD General Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet dictator of Georgia and usurper of power in Tbilisi in March 1992, known as Stalin II, was freezing cold. It is rare th at one observes operatives who are 'perfectly possessed', but certain candidates for this descr iption at the highest levels of the Bush Jr. Administration might spring to mind. Those who are perfectly possessed maintain an identical expression on their faces and usually never display any emotion at all. As will be explained in this study, this may be because they have progressed far along the path laid out for them during their Skull and Bones rituals or their initiations into the Fellow Craft Degree in Scottish Rite Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"XXIV THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER The state of mind and soul to which they are required, at this lowest level, to begin to aspire and to reach and surpass, was described by the late 33rd Degree Mason Manly P. Hall, as follows. The candidate must achieve 'the transmutation of personal affection into impersonal compassion .... Personalities cannot bind the true Second Degree member, for having raised one point of the compasses, he now realises that all personal manifestations ar e governed by impersonal principles'. 'At this point the candidate consecrates the five senses to the study of human problems with the unfolding sense centers as the motive; for he realises that the five senses are keys, the proper applicat ion of which will give him material for spiritual transmutation' 23 . The integrated instruction to 'study human problems' dispassionately, and to discard all personal affection in favour of 'i mpersonal compassion' (a contradiction in terms) both procures that the candidate/adept abandons any inclination to 'seek after the Lord thy God', and ensures that he discards his humanity, exchanging human warmth for a disconnected, dispassionate, co ld-hearted, illusory presumption that he is well on the way towards 'transmutation' (illumination). By contrast, the reality is that we are all, each one of us, born with the knowledge of God, and drawn to seek after Him because we are His creation (as is obvious to anyone who has observed a newborn baby at close quarters). Our lifelong, agreeable task is to 'seek the Lord, if haply [we] might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being;... For we are also his offspring' [Paul, in Acts, Chapter 17, verses 27-28]. ERSATZ 'HUMAN PROBLEMS': SUBSTITUTES FOR TRUE SPIRITUALITY The Illuminati Order's maddened offensive against True Christianity presupposes (erroneously) that it can be completely destroyed. But the presumption and instruction to substitute 'impersonal compassion' and th e 'study of human problems' for personal affection and our search for G od, has necessitated the creation of false, 'collective' concerns and issues which are presented for public consumption as 'human problems' that are intended to replace our search for God (labelled 'relig ion', a word that the Author finds somewhat obstructive and tries not to employ). These 'global issues' - the dubious, fabricated 'lines' about 'global warming', 'poverty in Africa', 'poverty eradication', Third World debt (an issue taken up for some reason by certain ignorant and uncomprehendingly bewildered Church of Engl and clerics), 'bird 'flu', AIDS, and so forth - are contrived specifically as substitutes for personal spirituality. Issues such as 'poverty in Africa' are also designed to provide fresh scamming opportunities - so that those gullible people attending 'pop' concerts in city parks having paid premium prices to sit in cramme d conditions in vast numbers to listen to tawdry 'music' noise on the pretext of 'helping alleviate poverty in Africa', have no real idea what happened to their money. In su mmary, they exchange good money, with no accountability, for a 'warm, fuzzy feeling' that they have contributed to the alleviation of one of the problems facing humanity - without undergoing any spiritual transformation in relation to God whatsoever. In the meantime, they have been fleeced, since the lack of accountability ensures that the huge sums raised by these means are routinely stolen. These events are just standard Illuminati scamming operations."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XXV In the 1930s and into the 1960s, an agitprop organisation calling itself 'The British-Israel Movement' flourished among Christian denominations in Britain and the United States. It claimed by convoluted false historical deduction that the Anglo- Saxons are descended from the wandering Israelites, and campaigned for a Union of Britain with Canada and the United States under British supremacy, along Rosicrucian lines. The organisation successfu lly raised very large sums of money ostensibly for Israel. The first page of an official booklet, devoted to this subject, quoted from 'The Fourth Book of Kings' - which of course does not exist. This was an early example of what has become the familiar practice of elaborating and spinning fairy tales from Scripture, on the sound assumption that only a small minority of the population reads the Holy Bible and would accordingly be equipped to expose the lies being disseminated. The example du jour as this book was being finalised was of course 'The Da Vinci C ode', exploiting the base lies that Jesus recovered from His Crucifixion and married Mary Magdalene. Other authors have written authoritatively on the vast interlocking spider's web of elitist criminal conspirators. The upper levels of the tightly compartmentalised Illuminati structural pyramid of secret societies feature planning committees of which the public has little or no knowledge. These uppe r levels embrace secr etive conclaves, of which the following have been identified by several authorities, led by the British intelligence officer Dr John Coleman, who published an analysis in 1992 entitled 'Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of The Committee of 300': The Council of Three, The Council of Five, The Council of Seven, The Council of Nine, The Council of 13, The Council of 33, The Grand Druid Council, The Committee of 300 (also called 'The Olympians'), and the Committee of 500. The considerable 'underground' literature on this subject is usually poorly annotated, and exposes appearing on the Internet are, with a handful of honourable exceptions, typically, and often deliberately, devoid of notes and references. Moreover such sources often provide uncorroborated information without addressing the question: 'Why?', wh ich is always the most important. THE AUTHOR'S APPR OACH IS INSTINCTIVE Rather than rely primarily on such sources, the Author has approached this vast subject instinctively, on the basis of his experience of strategic deception and intel- ligence community lies and scamming behaviour. There are undoubtedly many gaps in what follows; but this detailed atte mpt at exposing the Luciferian conspiracy, which binds the leaderships of all the G-8 countries and, these days, many of the others, is presented in good faith for use as a weapon against these evil people by all who know a little of these matters, and no d oubt by many who know much more than the Author does. It should be recalled that whenever a leader previously selected by the Illuminati proves not to be a 'team player' and to diverge from what is required of them, they are 'taken out' - prominent examples being President Kennedy, President Ali Bhutto (Pakistan), Aldo Moro (in Italy), and of course Mrs Thatcher, who belatedly realised that th e European Union was a trap. She probably never understood that it is, in fact, the ma nifestation of a long-range Abwehr strategic deception designed to decapita te the hated British wartime victors once and for all. The European Union forms one blade of the DVD's long-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"XXVI THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER range 'scissors strategy', the other blade of which is the Abwehr's fifth-column penetration of the key US structures [see page XXXIII] - another way of summarising German long-range strategy to defeat the 'main enemy' to that shown in the Conclusion on page 629. The US Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI) chief, Admiral Boorda - described by an impecca ble source as a great patriot - and the former Director of Central Intelligence, William Colby, were bot h 'taken out' because they had balked at, or were on the verge of exposing, operat ions or strategies of the Illuminati. SOME CLOSING CONSIDERATIONS The Author has been separately engaged in detailed research into how the New Underworld Order is being refinanced, at the intergovernmental level, where 'funny money' is conjured out of thin air by means of the sophisticated exploitation of the international fiat money financial system. At this level, billions are converted into trillions in the space of, say 18 months. Incorporation of this research would have resulted in the expansion of this presenta tion to well over 1200 pages; and since the research was ongoing as this book was being finalised, it has necessarily had to be excluded. Suffice it to say that a prolific money-generating engine has been perfected to finance the New Underworld Order. This Author substitutes 'Underworld' for 'World' so as to signal that these operations have been hijacked by the Illuminati - which makes it hard for patriotic intelligence officers who believe in the nation state, and who have to work in this environment, to ensure that th e Rule of Law is upheld. Those who cross the Illuminati criminals, are liable to suffer false witness, false arrest, false imprisonment, false house arrest, the illegal confiscation of their assets, and other abominations - harsh penalties that the corrupt intelligence comm unities reserve specially for the punishment of their own colleagues and employees who refuse, for instance, to agree to US Presidents stealing billions from trustors' accounts. The Author is referring here to specific information in his possession. The quotations from Scripture in this book are taken from the King James Version of the Holy Bible throughout. None of the other versions can be relied upon, since a subsidiary project of the Illuminati is to procure the repeated rewriting of Scripture until the Word of God is obliterated, or rende red of no value, and replaced by that of Lucifer - in accordance with a 'salami tactics' programme of constant textual 'renewal', contrary to warnings against tampering with Scripture that appear in both the Old and the New Testaments: 'The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, t hou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever' [Psalm 12, verses 6-7]. It is an interesting fact that three 'authors' of 'new versions' of the Holy Bible were struck dumb after their work had b een completed. Two of them, the nine- teenth century occultic spiritualists We stcott and Hort, changed the traditional Greek text which underlies the King James Version, in no less than 8,413 places - using the corrupt Vaticanus manuscript. Fo r the definitive studies which show that the King James Version is true, and the only text to be trusted and which certainly conveys the Word of God in its total purity, the reader is directed to the classic studies of this subject published in the United States by Dr Gail Riplinger 25 . The Author is solely responsible for any errors and omissions in this work. ■"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XXVII FOREWORD: Notes and references 1 John Buchan, The Thirty-Nine Steps ', William Blackwood & Sons Ltd, Pan Books Ltd, London, 1979, page 11. 2. It may of course never be possible, in this murky context, to expose more than a fraction of the truth. But enough of it can be exposed to make the investigatio n worth while, to help dispel familiar illusions, and even to make the ruthless enemy think twice. The alternative would be to emulate a person whom the Author once knew who said that 'I like my head stuck in the sand, and I prefer to leave it there'. 3 'Der Mann der Hitler die Ideen gab' ('The Man who gav e Hitler his Ideas'), 1958, cited in the excellent study of Nazi homosexuality, The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party', by Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, Founders Publishing Company, Box 20307, Keizer, OR 97307, USA, 1996, page 2. This is indispensable reading not leas t because it provides advance warning of the evil significance of the obvi ously deliberate homosexualisation of US and British political parties and institutions, including the mil itary. For instance, elements of the partly brainwas hed British military now routinely demand to know if new recruits are homosexual, not because this informat ion can in any way assist the military to do its job efficiently, but because a mandated proportion of the military population 'must' be homosexual in order to 'reflect' the proportion of homosexuality in the population (which is well below 1% but is malevolently asserted by mind-mapped apparatchiksto be of the order of 10%). 4.

The US intelligence author and deprogrammer Fritz Springmeier has revealed, in a treatise entitled The Top 13 llluminati Bloodlines', that most people th ese days are encumbered by built-in 'slides' which he revealed to be a CIA term for a conditioned type of re sponse which dead-ends a person's thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic at hand. For example, any mention of the word 'c onspiracy' usually generates a 'slide' response, with many unknowi ngly brainwashed people dismissing out of hand, in a knee-jerk reaction, the very notion that such a phenomenon as a conspiracy c ould ever exist. See the Author's reference, in the main text, to the fact that Lenin, an llluminati operat ive, himself specifically descri bed the World Revolution as a conspiracy. By creating a 'slide' that presupposes that there is no such thing as a conspiracy, the conspirators think they are permanently protected from exposure. 10. V. I.

Few analysts think strategically, especially in the intelligence communities - given compartmentalisation, the environment of lies and deception, and the breakup of national intelligence into competing groups manipulated by foreign powers. The Author has been able to identify these powers, and which US intelligence cadres appear to be attached to, working for or manipulated by them, by analysing remarks uttered by such people when taken off guard. For instance, one US intell- igence operative was caught staring that 'Britain will be left dangling', and insisting that Tony Blair, allegedly a corrupted asset of German/French 'Black' intelligence, would not be leaving office, in the face of widespr ead expectations to the contrary associated with UK corruption and murder investigations. A British Prime Minister is not protected for all time by a Secret Service, as is the case with US Presidents. From remarks such as these, and ample other evidence, cosidered in context, it has been possible to identify which ruthless competin g cadres within the vast US intelligence community are linked to which malevolent foreign power. Hatred of the British is usually a reliable indication of a German (DVD) connection. This Author has, in various private seria l publications of which he is the Editor, exposed the existence of the Dachau-Based German 'Black' intelligence agency, DVD (Deutsche Verteidigungs (or Versicherungs) Dienst), located, of all places, at Dachau, near Munich. Exposure of this agency, successor of the Nazi Abwehr, was 'never supposed to happen'; and as a consequence, th e entire postwar perspective has had to be revised. The Author was privileged to e xpose this organisation following the death of Sir Edward Heath, a long-term Abwehr agent, and the atrocities committed against British people and the UK infrastructure on 7th Ju ly 2005, which were allegedly ordered by President Chirac, Germany's co-conspirator, and monitored by GCHQ inter alia while the French President was in Gleneagles for a G-8 conference. It has since transpired that a fifth bomb was meant to have exploded in the Northern Line beneath the River Thames, and that, as a consequence, a sizeable proportion of the London Underground was to have been flooded - causing immense physical and psychological damage, murdering thousands of Londoners, and proba bly destabilising the whole world. This was being interpreted in intel ligence circles as nothing less than an act of war - as were indeed the 9/11 atrocities, which have also been traced to Al-Qaeda, an operation of German 'Black' intelligence, DVD. In both Britain and the United States, these atrocities were facilitated by deep, long-term German Nazi Continuum penetrations. In the United States, the Fifth Colu mn has resided since 1946 onwards primarily inside the CIA, and it is the German-linked cadres therein, led by the Frankfurt-based COREA group, which are predominantly behind the CIA's drug operations, and responsible for its comprehensive corruption - the term 'CIA ' embracing here all the myriad other US intelligence services, including"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER XXIX the National Security Agency (NSA), to whic h the CIA is supposedly subordinate. In the spring of 2006, it was the case that the NSA 'reported to' John Negroponte, the newly- installed US Director of National Intelligence (DNA), and that Negroponte allegedly 'reported to' George Bush Sr., who, over the years, has allegedly acquired control over at least $206 trillion (accor ding to sensitive inte lligence) of 'funny money' allegedly leveraged from the $4.0 billion amassed to finance the First Gulf War, the theft of assets arising from the collapse of Continental Illinois Bank, the exploitation of a Trust established by the late CIA Director of Central Intelligence, William Casey, and the massive looting operations carried out against the US Savings and Loan sector in the 1980s. George Bush Sr., alleged by British sources to be the actual head of the DVD, having succeeded Admiral Canaris in the late 1970s, also a llegedly has German citizenship, which can be based on ethnicity. A Jacobin Illuminist named Busche is identified by Professor John Robison of Edinburgh in his classic expose of the Illuminati, published in 1798 [on page 78 of the Western Islands edition, Boston, MA, 1967: see Figure 75 on page 495 of this work]. German 'Black' intelligence special ises in heroin, while the parallel French and Spanish 'Black' intelligence organisations 'do cocaine'. Spain, which is awash with drugs, has been a staging post for alleged Bush Sr.-connected Latin American drug deliveries into European countries. In the United Kingdom, German 'Black' intelligence has penetrated MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, via a UK 'Black' intelligence outfit labelled GO-2, which actually resides inside MI6. The Author has also be gun to expose this entity, which 'reports' to DVD in Dachau. GO-2 is responsible for 'managing' two drug cartels, and is accordingly ultimately responsible, under the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, allegedly a tool of German/French intelligence, for deliberately distributing cocaine into British schools. Both Britain and the United States have official structures which are divided against themselves, as a consequence of long -range foreign penetrations. It is understood that GCHQ, which 'reported to' GO-2, w oke up to this dreadful situation upon monitoring the 'act of war' allegedly ordere d by President Chirac for 7/7, alluded to above. It is also becoming clearer by the day that the following British Prime Ministers were (and/or are) controlled ultimately by the DVD: Macmillan, Wilson, Heath, and allegedly Tony Blair. In Germany itself, the DVD selects the Chancellor, and simply informs him or her of its activities. In othe r words, German 'Black' intelligence, which represents the Nazi Continuum, controls the Berlin Government and represents the custodian of continuing Nazi long-range strate gy. After all, the 'Madrid Circular Letter', intercepted by the Allies in the early 1950s [see page 573] proclaimed that 'For us, the war never ended': Fur uns, der Krieg ist niemals vorbei. It is clear from much of the evidence expose d in this book that the IUuminati provide German Nazi continuing strategic intelligen ce policymakers with long-range cover for their global control objectives. According to a high-level IUuminati source in the United States, the powers of 'Old Europe' are fighting for supremacy, and must be left to fight it out among themselves. This is one way of looking at the crisis. But it fails to explain the community of interests between the criminalist cadres of, for instance, the continuing Soviets (there was no discontinuity of Soviet strategy, either) and those of 'Black' Ops agencies run by the other Great Powers. In this rats' sewer flowing into the River Styx, all the Illuminati's stinking rats smell the same. ■"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"XXX THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER SOME PRINCIPAL THEMES OF THIS BOOK CONCEPTS WITH WHICH THE NON-SPECIALIST MAY BE UNFAMILIAR The New Underworld Order is driven by The (deranged) Order of the Illuminati, grafted onto Freemasonry - which it absorbed at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad in 1782 [see below] while retaining the outer structures of Speculative Masonry.

Manly Palmer Hall's caption reads: THE ORPHIC EGG The ancient symbol of the Orphic Mysteries was the serpent-entwined egg, which signified the Cosmos as encircled by the fiery Creative Spirit' [i.e., Satan]. The egg also represents the soul of the philosopher [sic]; the serpent, the Mysteries' [invocation of demons, magick, etc]. 'At the time of initiation the shell is broken and man emerges from the embryonic state of physical existence wherein he had remained through the foetal period of philosophic[al] regeneration'.

The dialectical method reflects this central re ality. Anyone who fails to discern this central truth will remain forever confused. Once we grasp this fact, the behaviour of the deranged manipulators exposed in this book becomes comprehensible, and we can never remain blinded and trapped for long by their serial lies and blandishments. A critical variant of the dialectical methodology is what can be called 'The Scissors Strategy', which is illustrated in simplified format below [and on page 629].

This slogan, which is dishonestly intend ed to lead the observer to understand, contrary to the actualite, that the CIA deals in the truth, also encapsulates another lie. The second lie hidden in the slogan explo its the cynical assumption that few in the modern world know Scripture. If they did, they would immediately be aware that this slogan is actually taken out of context from a glorious statement, given to us for our salvation, by Jesus Christ. The relevant text is to be found in the Gospel of J ohn, Chapter 8, verses 31-32: 'Then said Jesus to those Jews which believe d on him, 'If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free'. In other words, knowing the truth is e xplicitly conditional upon 'continuing in my word' - which means following the truth of Jesus Christ, who is the Way the Truth and the Life, i.e., walking in His Way. This truth is affirmed in John, Chapter 14, verse 6, where: 'Jesus saith unto him (Thomas): T am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh to the Father, but by me' 1 . No worship of the Virgin Mary, no obsession with sublimated obscenities such as flagellation ('mo rtification of the body') as taught by that sinister intelligence organisation Opus Dei, no diversionary preoccupation with weeping statues or Black Madonnas (Sufism), no oppression by false 'New Age' religions, no adherence to any other 'faith' on the erroneou s assumption of 'religious' equivalence, will procure the saving Grace of the Father, through the Holy Spirit. 'No man cometh to the Father, but by me'. True Christianity - and indeed access to the Truth - is exclusive, not inclusive. This naturally mean s that all diversionary 'religions', including Freemasonry with which the intelligence and some policymaking communities are infested, are absolutely incompatible with the Truth - that is, with the Way, the Truth and the Life. And because Freemasonry, the scaffoldin g of the Synagogue of Satan*, is in fact a gradualist introduction to Lucifer, the 'God of this World', it is particularly to be noted here, at the outset, that all forms of Masonry, which is witchcraft, are diversionary dead-ends, roadblocks erected by Satan to divert seekers after truth, from the Truth - leading those who indulge therein to perdition, being whol ly incompatible with 'continuing in my Word' so that 'ye shall know the truth', allowing 'the truth to set you free'. Indeed, the whole of the Truth is to be f ound clearly laid out by Jesus Christ in the Gospels; and those of a contrite, humble and tender heart are enjoined to read the * See Footnote at the end of the Notes and References to Chapter 1: page 32."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"2 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie Gospel of John to begin with, wherein he or she will find the certainty of the Way, the Truth and the Life. And the essence of the mystery of salvation is that, as Jesus Christ explains in John, Chapter 6, verse 65: 'No man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father'. So, when he or sh e, for instance, makes the crucial decision, having absorbed the above, to read the Gospel of John, that person is, by definition, thereby given the grace to do so 'of my Father '. The glory of spiritual salvation -through knowing the Truth that shall make us free - lies in the fact that the sum total of what is necessary to begin to claim it, is to make this one initial decision to seek the Truth where it lies, which has to come of our own free, unimpeded will. The Truth which such a contrite, humble and tender heart finds in response to being thus called 2 has nothing to do with any 'truth' purveyed by man - let alone with the kind of 'truth' that the CIA purports, accor ding to its deceitful slogan, to dispense. Apart from misrepresenting the words of Jesus by usurping them and taking them out of context, the slogan accordingly dispenses the lie that since the CIA deals in 'the truth', whatever it promulgates is 'the truth' - which by extension has the power to make Americans (and the rest of the world) 'free'. But, as this book shows, the CIA and the vast US intelligence community as a whole - with which we have to be primarily con cerned because of their global power, and because of their generational penetration by long-range German Abwehr/DVD and covert continuing Soviet agents and agents of influence - deal not in 'the truth' but in never-ending lies, or in lies, diversions and omissions mingled with truth, which amount to the same thing. For many of these people know little but deception as a way of life. In fact the omission of pertinent inform ation with an intention to mislead has been aptly described as the worst form of lie. Consequently, and logically, far from 'setting us free', the works of the US intellig ence Establishment, given the immensity and arrogance of its power, are in the process of oppressing not only the American people, but also the whole world. The CIA's participation in the international drug trade, emulating the long since expo sed drug offensive of the covert Soviet GRU-KGB against the West 3 , is a scandal of millennial proportions, which goes unaddressed. In this respect, as in so many other dimensions, the United States, at this stage of the World Revolution, is rapidly 'converging' 4 towards the 'former' USSR 5 - 'convergence' being a primary objective of the World Revolution. The fact that, as will be demonstrated in this book, the CIA's global drug-trafficking operations are in fact a dimension of the operations of the Illuminati, in no way 'e xcuses' the US intelligence community from responsibility for the perpetration of this abomination. U.S. INTELLIGENCE ADMITS IT HAS A 'HEART OF DARKNESS' As if to anticipate this book, a so-called 'former' US intelligence operative has openly acknowledged that US intelligence is engaged in Works of Darkness. Of course, we all know this - the whole world, since Abu Ghraib, now knows it, although even today few have any grasp of the scale of the reprobate US intelligence community's involvement in such works; but for a 'former' US intelligence operative to admit as much, is certainly a most interesting development. It would be comforting to believe that the remark was made in a contrite spirit of humility and tenderness towards those whom the intelligence community has wronged. No such luck, unfortunately. The 'former' operative's admission surfaced in an article by the veteran US investigative reporter (with the closest of intelligence community links), Seymour"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 3 Hersh, in the aftermath of the atrocities committed in Abu Ghraib, with which the US intelligence-linked corporations CACI and Titan 'were' associated (and for which they were largely responsible). Hersh was describing what he had learned about a 'Special-Access Program' (SAP), or clandestine 'Black' operati on subject to the US Defense Department's most stringent level of security, which was itself 'blown' by Hersh's revelations in The New Yorker 6 . Under the SAP, Hersh reported, 'commandos crossed borders wit hout visas and could interrogate terrorism suspects deemed too important for transfer to the military's facilities at Guantanamo, Cuba'. US commandos, operatives and other specialists 'carried out instant inte rrogations - using force if necessary -at secret CIA detention centers scattered all around the wo rld'. The (resulting) intelligence 'would be relayed to the SAP command center in the Pentagon in real time, and sifted for those pieces of information critical to the 'White', or overt, world' [see pages 6 and 8 et seq. for the significance of this differentiation from the 'Black', or 'covert' world]. This is the paragraph in which the unprecedented official admission in question was made: 'Fewer than two hundred operatives and officials, including [Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, Ch airman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were \"completely read into the program\", the former 7 intelligence official said. The goal was to keep the operation protected. \"We're not going to read more people than necessary into our heart of darkness\", he said. \"The rule s are: 'Grab whom you must. Do what you want\"'. For any US intelligence official to acknowle dge publicly that his or her intelligence community has a 'heart of da rkness' is probably unprecedente d. All national intelligence communities, being essentially ocultically-o riented secret societies riddled with Freemasonry, have 'hearts of darkness'; but they scarcely ever admit this central reality, other than via symbology, such as MI5's reve alingly esoteric triangle-symbol shown in Figure 1 below. Two possible explanations for this open admission of collective demonic possession, which emerged in the aftermath of the maelstrom of reve- Figure 1: THE ILLUMINATI EMBLEM OF MI5 WHICH TELLS US EVERYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW With growing lay knowledge and understanding of the transnational depredations of occultic Masonry, many organisations have adopted the practice of hiding their Freemasonic and llluminati connections and pedigrees - although it is deliberately 'allowed', in what they name the 'Age of Aquarius', that esoteric orientations may be displayed. The international oil companies have always displayed their geomasonic linkages through corporate symbology (pyramids, sunburst s, circles, etc). Britain's MI5 intelligence service uses this occultic pyramid symbol, which is almost 100% geomasonic. In the top sub-triangle, the 'I', supposedly for Intelligence, is symbolic of the all- seeing eye of Set (Satan) or Lucifer, which is also shown. In the left sub-triangle, the 'M', which the layman is supposed to assume stands for 'Military', further alludes to Molech, the Caananite god-idol to which the children of Israel sacrificed their unwanted children. In the right-hand sub-triangle, the 'V stands not only for the 'perfect number' 5, but also, in part, for the state of so- called 'perfect knowledge' to which Freemasons aspire as they 'progress' towards total Illumination (actual possession by Lucifer, or Set). "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"4 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie lations and reports surrounding the Satanic abus e perpetrated inter alia by those 'cutout' US intelligence operatives at the notorious Abu Ghraib detention facility in the Baghdad area and elsewhere, sprang to mind. One possibility was that the official intelli gence 'owners' of the 'heart of darkness' are so Satanised and indifferent to the sufferi ngs they inflict that they couldn't care less any more, especially now that they have been 'rumbled', what the rest of the world thinks. Such an attitude would be consistent with the arrogant protestation, heard repeatedly from some Americans, that it doesn't matter what conclusions the rest of the world has reached concerning the dangers that this revolutionary United States now presents to humanity: what matters is that America should be feared. The second possibility is th at the intelligence source who briefed Hersh was somewhat ashamed of the blackness of the CIA/DIA's collective 'heart of darkness', and was dismayed by the appalling international publicity as well as by the fact that this SAP had gone so badly wrong: 'We've never ha d a case where a Special-Access Program went sour - and this goes back to the Cold War'. He complained that the intelligence officer to whom Mr Rumsfeld had delegated the SAP, Stephen Cambone, an operative with an allegedly murky past, had decided to bring the SAP rules (i.e., the absence of all residual morality) into the prisons; in other words, the regular military personnel operating in the prisons were told that what went on there now formed part of the covert operation, where no civilised rules applied. By the time the official's 'heart of darkness' admission appeared in print, the whole world had been reminded that the United States' regard for human life and dignity was as depraved as that of the Hitler and Stalin regimes; that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely; and that the United States' protestations that it was engaged in 'spreading democracy' in a region where it is non-existent, was indeed, as had always been widely assumed, a disreputably fraudulent prospectus. This was the case not least because the United States is itself in the ha bit of rigging its own electoral process, as the extensively documented fiddling of the November 2004 General Election demonstrated [see Addendum 1, page 662]. The shamefacedness of the Bush II Admini stration on this score was repeatedly in evidence following that election, as top officials from the President down reiterated the official 'line' that the United States is th e guardian angel of that wondrous gift called 'democracy'. For example, on 16th June 2005, President G. W Bush denounced the Iranian election as a sham designed to ensure that power was to be retained in the hands of an undemocratic, repressive elite. 'The Iranian people', Mr Bush said, 'deserve a genuinely democratic system in which elec tions are honest, and in which their leaders answer to them instead of the other way ar ound'. This hypocritical statement - one of many of its kind coming from a US President who, whatever may have been thought of the heavily Soviet-penetrated US Democratic Party, is shown to have presided over a political machine that stole both the election of 2004 and the preceding election - was typical of lies perpetrated by the head of a regime engaged in the exercise of 'democratism' (a Soviet-era wo rd meaning 'the creation and maintenance of the illusion of democracy') who, by ingrained habit, chooses to be unable and unwilling to distinguish between truth and falsehood. For Iranians, who are no fools, to be told by a US President who claimed to be sustaining 'freedom' while openly depriving the American people of it, and who bragged about democracy after having usurped power which is supposed to flow from the people, was further proof of the accuracy of their"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 5 slogan describing the United States as 'the Great Satan'. Mr Bush then tried to distinguish between the Iranian regime and the people of Iran by hurriedly elaborating that 'today, the Iranian regime denies' the Iranian people their rights. 'It brutalises its people and denies their liberty'. And Washington wondered why the Iranian people are so manifestly equivocal about American official professions of 'friendship' towards them, as opposed to their regime. It is because the level of hypocrisy pouring out of Washington's intelligence- controlled regime stinks in their nostrils. Take the President's assertion on that occasion that the Iranian regime 'brutalises' its people', a true statement that is overwhelmingly supported by the historical record. The US regime does likewise. For instance, from late 2004 onwards, US journalists have been sent to jail for refusing to divulge their sources to the authorities, which is exactly what happens in brutalised states like, say, Zimbabwe. In 2005, Andrew Stephenson, who worked tirelessly pro bono publico to expose the fraudulence of the 2004 General Election [see Appendix 1], made the serious mistake of seeking employment in Washington DC as a lobbyist, having exhausted his financial resources. On the plane back to his home city, Seattle, he was taken violently ill, and was later diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas. After patriotic Americans rallied round and raised, in extremely short order, no less than $70,000 to finance a very serious surgical operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital, carried out by the nation's top surgeon in this discipline, attempts were made by one of the US Government's several hyperactive disinformation and discrediting teams to spread lies to the effect that Stephenson had raised the funds for his own benefit, i.e. fraudulently. When activists exposed these lies and their perpetrators, the hospital authorities professed to have been unable to locate the $70,000, which had been despatched to them by Fedex (it was suddenly 'found' lying unopened in an o ffice). After Stephenson's return to Seattle, another branch of the evil US intelligence disinformation team (based in Toronto) intervened unilaterally with the Seattle authorities, who were to have provided Andy Stephenson with urgently necessary chemotherapy, so that his insurance cover was suddenly cancelled. On 9th June, a very senior US intelligence official (one of the few with any integrity) informed this Author that the virus that will have caused Stephenson's cancer was most likely injected via syringe into a toothpaste tube in his hotel room: 'That's how they do it', he added. A few days later, a colleague (of this Author) who was attending a political reception, raised the subject of the Gove rnment's repressive policies with a person known to be an intelligence officer as well as a political operator. He 'snapped his fingers', whereupon two operatives approached our friend and entered into a conversation, dealing with certa in issues that our friend had raised. One of these, a Transportation Security Agency (TSA) operativ e, said gratuitously, on the subject of poisonings, that 'a lot of these are happening' [sic] - meaning that the US Government is engaged, 'as we speak', in the standard Illuminist practice of poisoning its enemies. It therefore, self-evidently 'ill behoves' the President of the United States to lecture the Iranians (and other foreigners whose governments are equally the servants of Lucifer) on the abominations of their governments, and the repressive policies against their own people that they perpetrate, when the US Government is itself engaged in the same kind of Satanic behaviour while professing that it is the guardian angel of freedom and democracy. No wonder such official hypocrisy stinks in the nostrils of members of the human r ace who have not yet succumbed to th e orchestrated dumbing-down processes being perpetrated against them by their own Illuminised governments."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"6 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie Manifestly such behaviour, and any association with it or condoning of it, is incompatible with the Way, the Truth and the Life. A certain kindly American intell- igence officer known to the Author has touchingl y protested that he loves the Lord first, and his country next - which, be ing interpreted, and in the context in which this statement was made - meant that he saw no incompatibility between his lifelong association with the CIA, and thus with its 'heart of darkness', and his 'commitment' to Jesus Christ. Unfortunately, such a convenient compromise is out of the question for those who profess to believe, and therefore hope for salvation. In Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 10, verse 21, Paul warns: 'Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils'. A choice has to be made. Shall I remain associated with this intelligence organisation and its now openly self-acknowle dged 'heart of darkness'? Or shall I renounce, once and for all, the 'Works of Darkness', so that I shall, by the Grace of the Holy Sprit, be available to be saved? 'Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall' [I Corinthians Chapter 10, verse 12]. And in Paul's Epistle to the Ephesi ans, Chapter 5, verse 11, Paul commands: 'And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them...'... which is what this work humbly seeks, to the very best of the Author's ability and resources, to do. Note crucially that Paul describes all Works of Darkness as 'unfruitful' - something of an understatement, perhaps, given that, since the Devil is the author of confusion, all Works of Dar kness (and therefore all intelligence operations and activity) are characterised by endless strife, contentiousness, bitterness, false witness, deception, lies and generally re probate behaviour. The Author has himself been a witness to, and a victim of, of this routine pattern of official delinquency, in the course of research inter alia for this book. Indeed, in the intelligence community context, such institutionalised delinquency in the name of national security soon becomes qu ite obvious to the targeted observer who is not sitting on his or her brains. One reason for this is that the same techniques are always redeployed, since the Devil knows of no new tricks. The preoccupations, for instance, of the US intelligence community typically revolve around launching fresh d eception or scamming operations in order to cover up past 'botches' - operations which have gone badly wrong and have unravelled. Indeed it is characteristic of the CIA and its internal subsidiaries and rivals that they specialise in operations that go wrong. So there is a constant imperative to develop fresh initiatives to cover up previous botches, or to provide 'diversionary services'. This behaviour is akin to that of a gambler at a casino who has lost more than he possesses and who seeks ever more desperately to recoup his losses by taking risks against unbeatable odds, in the pathetic hope that he will 'get lucky' and will not only recoup all his losses, but will earn a profit, too. Of course, this never happens. Hersh's article on the circumstances surrounding Abu Ghraib made it crystal clear that what the 'former' intelligence official who admitted that the CIA (et al) has 'a heart of darkness' was most concerned about was that the secret SA P or 'Black' operation, which he said at one point 'is still active', would never be exposed (even though, as indicated, he was himself helping to expose it). The 'Black' programme had to be kept in the darkness and not revealed to the 'White' world, according to an intelligence 'consultant' also interviewed by He rsh - not only for security reasons, but"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 7 also 'because the process is unpleasant. It's like making sausage: you like the result but you don't want to know how it was made'. A Eu ropean version of this syndrome reads: 'When you put your shoes outside your hotel room at night for polishing, you don't want or need to know who cleaned them'. 'Also', the 'former' intelligence officer to ld Hersh, 'you don't want the Iraqi public and the Arab world, to know' (what utterly depraved barbarians we are - Ed.). 'Remember, we went to Iraq to democratise the Middle East [sic!]. The last thing you want to do is let the Arab world know how you treat Arab males in prison'. But so 'botched' was this accursed Work of Darkness, that not just the Arab world, but every corner of the globe, today knows how certain brutal ised Americans treat Arab males in prison: with total indifference to suffering, with depraved sexual lust and with Nazi-like contempt. Reports of imprecise British atrocities perpetrated in Iraq appear to have been disseminated in part so as to take the spotlight off the aberrations of the offending American personnel, although it appear s that the collapse of morality which underlies the US abominations has infected the British as well. This behaviour is consistent with the indoctrination format espoused and perpetrate d by the Illuminati, which seeks to procure that selected victims, operatives and imple-menters of its nefarious plans must be brought to inflict pain without flinching, to kill if necessary without ever looking back afterwards, and to maximise the potential of the use of fire. In his last interview before his sudden death duri ng an exorcism of a young girl in July 1999, the Author's late friend Fr Malachi Martin ex plicitly confirmed that Luciferians (who are worshippers of, and are possessed by, Lucifer) 'have all passed through [initiation] and that involves three things: the infliction of pain without flinching, the infliction of death without flinching, and the use of fire'. It is no accident that, since Abu Ghraib a nd the less publicised parallel American atrocities were first exposed, the whole world has been gratuitously provided with an excuse to ignore the Geneva Conventions in the future - a development that will of course inevitably rebound upon US combatants in the years ahead. But from the perspective of the Illuminati, this coarsening of perceptions of what is acceptable, serves their objective of desensitising humanity to the terminal horrors to come - just as the reprobate, perverse contemporary obsession with teaching schoolchildren about the Holocaust, death and murder (through Satani c videos and music, school plays and other teaching methods) serves the self-same Sata nic purpose [See Addendum 2, page 675]. Meanwhile, of course, the US State Depa rtment's complaints about human rights abuses abroad, published in its annual Cong ressionally mandated compendium entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (which covers almost every territory in the world with the singular exception of the United States itself), have lost all credibility. In summary, the primary message Washington has successfully delivered into every TV- owning and newspaper-reading household in the wo rld is that, since 9/11, the end justifies the means, and the rule of international law has been consigned to the historical dustbin, even as the United States self-righteously professes otherwise. This is the very essence of the perverted philosophy of the Sect of the Illuminati, [see Chapter 7] which the intelligence-controlled US Government serves. For, as John Robison, author of the first expose of the sect wrote, in his 'Proofs of a Conspiracy' [1798], the Illuminati espouse 'the propriety of employing, for a good purpose, the means which the wicked employ for evil purposes' 8 : The end justifies the means. This is the common thread which 'illuminates' everything they do."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"8 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie SEGREGATING THE 'BLACK' WORLD FROM THE 'WHITE' WORLD What the 'former' US intelligence officer speaking to Seymour Hersh worried most about, then, was not that US CIA-linked and military personnel had been involved in serial atrocities, and that such behaviour continued unabated, but rather that a typical example of the US intelligence community 's serial 'Works of Darkness' had surfaced into the 'White', or overt, world, also mentioned by this operative - that is, the 'normal' world which US intelligence officers typically look down upon because of their 'superior' knowledge and possession of 'secrets', and becau se they believe that they control the perceptions of the 'White' world from which they themselves originated but which they have come to despise. Indeed, a senior CIA officer, lecturing on a 'spy cruise' off the US West Coast in the spring of 2003, took pride in the claim that US intelligence controls the mainstream media 9 . And it subsequently emerged, thanks to leaks from a TV studio, that there appears to be an intelligence cell attached to every US mainstream media newsroom 10 in the United States. This explains why thinking Americans ri ghtly complain that the news fed to them is controlled. They know this instinctively, and they are right: Fox News is now regarded as the US Government's propaganda channel, and CNN was rapidly acquiring a similar reputation as this book was being finalised. For it is indeed the case that the intelligence community - which controls the US Governme nt, as will be seen - necessarily, as a prerequisite for and as a corollary of doing so, also controls the dissemination of 'information', as is the case in the covert Soviet Union. Hence, the United States is 'converging' ever more comprehensively and dialectically towards the dark models of the covert 'former' Soviet Union and the Nazi Third Reich. Why is it that abuses by the CIA and its 'protected' barons, its global scamming operations and its involvement in drug-trafficking on the pretext that this gives it an insight into the parallel covert ongoing Soviet drugs offensive, have been reported and scrutinised for decades, with not the slightest ch ange in this monstrous organisation's behaviour being detectable? The Senate Committee on Inte lligence headed by Senator Frank Church, of Idaho, in 1975, sifted through the CIA's abuses and dark operations over the preceding two decades, to zero effect. Afterwards, Se nator Church was duly liquidated - a fate which has likewise been the lot of innumerable operatives associated with the nexus of serial US official criminality that is loosely labelled 'Iran-Contra'. The multiple (and continuing) abuses committed, by design, by the CIA's 'cutouts' in Iraq (and of course in Afghanistan and else where) are merely symptomatic of the pitch blackness of the CIA's 'heart of darkness', which will be illustrated in this book. And the likelihood of any change occurring appears to be non-existent. On 10th August 2004, President George W Bush, fresh from telling election gatherings about his faith in God, confirmed his nomination of a man with a reputation for possessing one of the CIA's darkest hearts of all - the eight-term Republican Congressman and fellow Yale graduate, Porter Goss, a 'former' CIA case officer with an allegedly murky past - as his choice for Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), foll owing the earlier forced resignation under imprecise dark clouds of his predecessor, Mr George Tenet, a man whose code name reads both ways: spelt backwards, his name is unchanged. Such a name is ideal for an Illuminati operative, whose chief characteristic is that, by definition, he is double-minded in all that he thinks, schemes, says and does. One intelligence analyst described Porter Goss, who was fired by Bush Jr. in 2006, as 'a former point man for assassinations , a former CIA agent, who left the CIA"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 9 under clouded circumstances.

None of these allegations were recycled when Goss suddenly 'resigned' in the spring of 2006. Citing comments by Al Martin (pseudonym) - said to have 'intelligence connections' and to be a former 'contributor' to the President's Council of Economic Advisers - the source reported in that 'in 1983, Goss was allegedly involved in Iran-Contra profiteering with Jeb and Neil Bush and he was allegedly exposed' (according to this 'Al Martin') 'in his involvement in Neil Bush's alleged Destin Country Club development fraud - a fraud out of which he allegedly made $3 million illegally. He then became involved with Carlos Cardoen and Swissco Management, and the fraud that Swissco Management committed, not only in Florida, but throughout the United States, in those so-called illicit 'tax-swap deals'. You could compare it [Goss's selection by President Bush to head the CIA, albeit for less than two years] to the crime family where the soldier rises from the street to become the capo, having taken the hits over the years for his superiors in the organization'. The source continued: 'Of course, unlike an organized crime fa mily, the difference between the Administration and your average run-of-the-mill organized crime family is that the (present) Cabal controls not only the entire nation, but influences policy throughout the planet. They are above all laws and impervious to any action'. 'Al Martin' - who curiously appears to be protected from the consequences of some of his reported statements - was further quoted as saying that 't he Bush-Cheney regime must feel that it is a risk worth taking [appointing Goss] because they are now in de facto control of the mainstream media'. 'So, therefore, how much of Goss's past would be liable to be brought up?' at his US Senate confirmation hearings, and in the mainstream press? None of the relevant information, obviously 11 . And so it proved. Following Goss's departure, the services of the flawed military spy, General Mike Hayden, were solicited. In 1986, Porter Goss's alleged involvement in the Destin Country Club fraud, the Swissco Management fraud, the Topsail Development fraud, the Destin Dome fraud, and various other frauds with which members of the Bush family were allegedly involved, was indeed revealed in The Washington Times. Yet, disgracefully, not a single reference to any of this background appeared, for in stance, in the reports on Goss's nomination published in The Financial Times on 11th August 2004 12 . Of course not. On the contrary, the British newspaper was more interested in the relish with which Mr Goss, as Chairman of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Oversight Committee, had criticised and clashed with the former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), George Tenet, over complaints of inad equate clandestine human intelligence collection (HUMINT) - a debate which is nothing new, having persisted ever since the days when the subsequently murdered William Colby was the DCI. Like President Vladimir Putin, who is a Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) officer accustomed to using his 'KGB past' as cover, Porter Goss was allegedly a US military intelligence officer 'before' joining the CIA. His past alleged involvement in a trail of 'wet affairs' (assassinations) lends a sinister meaning to his observation, when still Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that 'we are being too namby-pamby about taking risks to get the good penetration of the hard targets in the denied areas'. But it is precisely because this book inevitably has to address the 'Works of Darkness', and some of those who perpetrate and preside over them, that the Author considered it essential - in order for the reader to keep his or her bearings, and to be aware that the Author does not peer into the darkness for prurient, but rather for"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"10 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie exposure, reasons - that it should begin with references to the Way, the Truth and the Life, namely the opposite of the darkness, ac cess to which remains open to anyone who may decide, for his or her own salvation, to renounce all 'Works of Darkness', that is, to make the necessary choice. Indeed this o pportunity is explicitly alluded to by Jesus Christ himself, in Luke, Chapter 6, verse 35, where He explains: 'But love ye your enemies, and do good... and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest; for He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil'. For this reason alone, this book will doubt less be considered highly subversive in certain quarters. That is not its intention. However it is unavoidable that the truth will irritate corrupted sensibilities and will thre aten to destabilise lies, deception and disin- formation. And it may come as a surprise to many that the Lord is even willing to accept the evil man and woman indulging in the kinds of abominations described in this book, who truly repents. The subversiveness of this book relates to the obvious reality that consorting with the Works of Darkness, whether within an intelligence community or not, is incompatible with the sal vation uniquely offered by Jesus Christ. Those US operatives who, like the disgrace d Robert Hanssen, belong to Opus Dei, which is exposed for what it is in Chapter 6, and who console themselves with the false panacea of purgatory offered by the Catholic Church, are deluding themselves, as there is no such place: it is a self-serving diversionary invention that is devoid of all Scriptural content. [Note: Contrary to the official lie, the traitor against the United States, Robert Hanssen, is not held in solitary confinement si ne die in a Colorado top security facility, in a dungeon with no natural light and only a comput er as company, but is in fact today a free man - an example of how the US legal system is routinely abused in the interests of the US intelligence community to convey on e impression for public consumption and to sustain the false appearance of the integrity of the system, whereas in practice the outcome is the opposite of the public perception]. Figure 2: A REAGAN-GORBACHEV GEOMASONIC HANDSHAKE The late President Ronald Reagan and 'former' President Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (whose German Jewish name is Orbach or Korbach), at their first meeting, held in Versoix, Switzerland, on 19th November 1985. In this old photograph. President Reagan is shown 'gripping' with the geomasonic Supreme Master Grip, with a pronounced 'Ma-Ha-Bone' ('Lion's Paw'). Gorbachev attempts the same, but Mr Reagan (who is in full control here) won't allow the same grip. This reveals that Ronald Reagan, a supremely powerful Luciferian, could demand (and main- tain) 'the upper hand\". The 'Ma-Ha-Bone' Real Grip of the Master Mason entails the grasping of the other's wrist as Reagan is doing, indicating who is the Boss. The Master Mason (or higher) firmly grasps the right hand of the fellow Mason. The thumbs of both the hands are interfaced. The first Mason (Reagan) presses the tips of all his fingers hard against the wrist of the fellow Geomason, where it unites with the hand. For further graphic instances of how the llluminati-penetrated and -controlled geomasonic fraternity in public life signal their Masonic credentials to each other, see page 734. Mr Gorbachev has remained clandestine supremo of the KGB Continuum, concentrating on the subversion of the 'Main Enemy', Britain and the United States: 'working by other means' [Lenin]. ■"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 11 The intelligence community's concept of the 'White' world - which of course presupposes the existence of its own world of darkness, or 'Black' world, exposed in Seymour Hersh's cited article - was as revea ling as the 'former' intelligence officer's actual acknowledgement that the CIA and the rest of the US intelligence community possesses a 'heart of darkness'. Because, if on e stops to think about this, what was meant is that there is no 'whiteness' in the intelligen ce community at all. After all, if the outside is 'White' in the minds of US operatives, the inside has to be 'Black'; otherwise it would not be necessary to describe the 'overf outside world as 'White'. By extension, for representatives from the 'White' world to complain about the pitch blackness of the 'Black', covert intelligence wo rld, would seem, on the face of it, to be a waste of time - were it not for one critical factor. This is that representatives of the 'Black' world of corrupt, criminalised intelligence occupy supreme positions of power in the US 'White' world, precisely as they do in the 'former' Soviet Union. Almost every notable 'player' on the Washington scene is, or 'has been', a US intelligence officer. Scratch anyone you meet in these circles and you will soon discover an intelligence connection. The same applies to almost everyone one meets in the US capital area. And just about every Washington think-tank, institute, pressure group and lobbying organisation has intelligence connections - or else, like the Heritage Foundation, the Institute of Policy Studies, and the Institute of World Policy, serves its interests, or those of a particular compartmentalised fraction or sector thereof. Indeed it has been the Author's experien ce over four decades that no US pressure group, think-tank or other seemingly worthy-sounding organisation turns out, upon investigation or on the basis of practical experience, to be the 'free-standing' organisation that it purports to be. Almost every such entity has an intelligence axe to grind. Apparently objective and sympathetic analysts operating websites or intensive email correspondence operations turn out with alarming frequency to be US intelligence "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"12 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie officers or paid disinformation specialists - exposed when they themselves blow their own cover, which, being typically careless, th ey are very apt to do. After countless years of being deceived by these decoys, the Author and many of his concerned US friends have 'wised-up' to the comprehensive scope of the US intelligence community's penetration of its own society, which was al ready pervasive enough before the Department of Homeland Security, a.k.a. the emerging US Ministry of State Security, was given carte blanche to perpetrate acts such as the removal of people off the streets and to fly them in a special Boeing to unknown destinations. And since the US intelligence structures are themselves deeply penetrated and compromised, especially by covert and even overt Soviet, East German (STASI - i.e., deep cover DVD) and Israeli agents, it follows from these findings alone that the United States is fa r from being master of its own ultimate fate (as will be further and sepa rately proven in this work). A particularly alarming feature of the intelligence environment in the first decade of the 21st century, furthermore, is the ease with which the professional cameraderie that flourishes between national intelligence communities has 'legitimised' the apparent wholesale penetration of US in telligence, so that all conc erned take this for granted. INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES IN HIGH PLACES Bill Clinton is allegedly a CIA operative, as is his wife, Hillary (whose codename is 'Queen Melusina'). The codename for Ms. Condoleeza Rice is 'Velvet Mushroom'. According to a US intelligence operative and other sources, George W. Bush's Vice President, Richard Cheney was allegedly in charge of the CIA's notorious MK-ULTRA mind-bending and personality-alteration programme for some years. George Bush Sr., of course, was Director of Central Intelligence before becoming Vice President under President Reagan, and subsequently President. He had remained (at our press date) essentially the most important and powerful in telligence 'baron' in the United States ever since - emulating President Mikh ail Gorbachev, who remains 'to this day' the ultimate boss of the covert Soviet KGB [information provided to the Author by a senior US intelligence source]. Ronald Reagan's Masonic pedigree, ill ustrated for instance by his tell-tale Ma-Ha- Bone handshake when greeting Pr esident Gorbachev [see Figure 2] 13 , suggests he will also have had intelligence connections: he was certainly a very senior Mason. Al Gore, Vice- President under President Clinton, and with family connections to Soviet figures, has allegedly amassed intelligence on key US intelligence officeholders as a means of procuring protection for himself and his family, having endured threats from intelligence cadres to one or more of his children (they do this to each other all the time: we are describing an inner chamber of hell here). President Ford, with enveloping intelligence connections and the 'highest' Mason ever to ha ve occupied the Oval Office, is mentioned as engaging in depraved activities in a work (written by a CIA Psy-Ops operative, Mark Phillips, who was responsible for the 'devil in the smoke' picture taken on 9/11: Figure 3), which describes the extreme depredati ons of the intelligence community's psycho- manipulation programmes such as MK-ULTRA, over which, as noted, Vice-President Dick Cheney, with his special experience, allegedly presided 14 . President George W. Bush Jr. is known to have carried out intelligence missions working directly for his father, and to have managed certain Bin Laden family finances.

As the hand signals given at his Inauguration on the occult date of 20th January 2005 [Figure 4, below and Addendum 9, page 732] revealed, it is clear that he serves the interests of the Illuminati. George Bush Sr.'s Vice-President, Dan Quayle, is a CIA operative who is now extensively engaged in global investment and 'h edge fund' activity through, inter alia, an investment fund called Cerberus Capital Management, which specialises in buying up near-bankrupt or failing enterprises in Asia and elsewhere [See Addendum 3, page 679]. Hedge funds buy up such assets because illicit funds need laundering, i.e. 'place-ment', more urgently than rate of return: indeed, the fundamental difference between any drug money flows and all normal flows-of-funds is that the drug money pipeline is endless and is always in urgent need of 'placement'. It is significant that Cerberus was the monstrous watchdog of Hades with 50 heads and a voice of bronze (that is to say, a voice like one who is possessed with devils) who guarded the hideous gate of the Kingdom of Hades in Greek mythology. Sometimes Cerberus had only three heads. Sometimes he bristled with serpents and his evil mouth dribbled black venom. Once a visitor had passed Hades' guard-dog, he could never re-emerge. So why on earth (or in hell) would anyone want to name a hedge fund after such a hellish underworld monster? That question, obviously, is answered in general terms by reference to the afore- mentioned self-exposure of the CIA's heart of da rkness. It is also interesting to recall that Huntington, Indiana, where Quayle grew up, was at one stage (and may still be) particularly notorious for its manifestations of wicca and Sata nism. As will be shown inter alia in the chapter on the sect of the Illuminati, which controls US and other intelligence services, the proliferation of occultism is a primary dimension of the N.U.O. This is why video games and other materials disseminated through chain bookstores in the United States and elsewhere have reached levels of murderous obscenity and depravity consistent with Satanic possession and the reign of Lucifer. Figure 4: President George W. Bush Jr. displays the standard Satanic gesture during the Ina uguration on 20th January 2005. The 'line', for public consumption purposes, was that this hand signal represented the 'Hook 'em Horns' gesture employed by fans of the University of Texas Longhorns. This was the fairytale disseminated by Associated Press and CNN, despite conclusive evidence, supported by academic authorities, that this gesture represents an open celebration of, and a sign of obeisance to, the Devil (Satan, or Lucifer)."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"14 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie THE MAN WHO CONDONED THE DROPPIN G OF PEOPLE INTO THE SEA After the nomination of Porter Goss as Director of Central Intelligence, perhaps the most insensitive, sinister and perverse 'heart of darkness' appointment by President George Bush II in 2004 was his selection of John Negroponte, a Sephardic Jew, as Ambassador to Baghdad, where he was to head up the largest US Embassy in the world, with more than 3,000 employees and over 500 CIA officers. Despite this Mr Negroponte's infamous record in Central America, this man encountered negligible Congressional opposition, even from Senate Democrats who once criticised him for supporting widespread human rights abuses. But that was then: post-Abu Ghraib is now: and he is crowned with worldly glory, as the Director of National Intelligence. As US Ambassador to Honduras, Negroponte played a key role in coordinating US covert aid to Contra death squads in Nicaragua, and to shoring-up a CIA-backed death squad operating in Honduras itself. During Negroponte's term as Ambassador there, diplomats alleged that the local US Embassy's annual human rights document, submitted for inclusion in the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices compendium, made Honduras appear to be more like Norway than Argentina. In 1995, The Baltimore Sun - which still seemed free, back then, to publish information that might be censored by its in-house intelligence cell today - outlined the activities of a secret CIA-trained Honduran army unit, Battalion 3-16, which employed \"shock and suffocation devices in interrogations\" reminiscent of the hooded figure image depicting the US atrocities in Abu Ghraib [Figure 5]. The newspaper's correspondents wrote: \"Prisoners often were kept naked and, when no longer useful, were killed and buried in unmarked graves\". In other words, these Abu Ghraib-style atrocities are nothing new at all: they have been standa rd US practice for decades. A former official who served under Mr Negroponte in Honduras has said that he was ordered to remove all mention of torture and executions from the draft of his 1982 report on the human rights situation in Honduras, sanitised as usual for consumption in the 'White' world. It was interesting that Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Stalin's grandson, who opposed John Negroponte when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported his nomination to be US Ambassador to the United Nations in 2001 (the post he occupied before his Iraq posting), suddenly now came out in support of this man - observing for the record that 'whatever differences I've had years ago with John Negroponte, I happen to feel he's a very fine Foreign Service officer and has done a tremendous job in many places'. The hearings on Negroponte's nomination to be US Ambassador to Baghdad were punctuated by protests and statements from knowledgeable outside experts who were in a position to remind the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (consisting extensively of intelligence operatives masquerading as politicia ns) of Mr Negroponte's extremely murky past 15 , including his apparent readiness to condone, facilitate and preside over the recorded practice of dropping those who were to be 'disappeared', from a helicopter into the ocean. One of the outside witnesses who contribut ed to the Committee's hearing held on 27th April 2004 to approve the nomination of John Negroponte as Ambassador to Iraq, was a certain Sister Laetitia Bordes, a Catholic nun with the Society of Helpers, a Catholic community for women. Her remarks, relayed from San Bruno, California, are taken verbatim from the transcript of the hearing: 'I had gone to Honduras to meet with then-Ambassador John Negroponte to find out what happened to 32 women from El Salvador, who had taken refuge in"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 15 Honduras and who had disappeared. At that time, there was the Battalion 3-16 [see page 14]. The Battalion was another name for the horrible death squad that was operating in Honduras at that time. That was well known to Ambassador Negroponte. The reason it was very well known to Ambassador Negroponte was that General Alvarez Martinez was then Chief of the Honduran ar med forces, and he was the secret head of Battalion-316. Now, Mr Negroponte and Martinez, the people would tell you, it was known that they would wine and dine together, and had ongoing connections. So, it is absurd to think that Mr Negroponte would say that he did not know what was going on in El Salvador at that time. As I found out 13 years later, the women we were looking for had been badly, badly tortured and then put in a helicopter and dr opped into the ocean. Th ey used Salvadoran military and helicopters to take these women and drop them over the ocean. Now, Battalion 3-16 continued to function the whole time that Negroponte was there'. The ocean over which recalcitrant Iraqi b odies might 'conveni ently' be dropped today is located several hours' flying time further away than the vast ocean available to the Honduran death squads. But Sister Laetitia pressed home her point, to the reported annoyance of members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee: 'General Alvarez was beheaded by his own military. There was a kind of coup, and he took temporary refuge in the United States. When he went back to Honduras, he was assassinated. It is believed that he was assass inated by members of the military, who were very upset with him because of the deals that he had made with the United States [i.e., with John Negroponte] while he was in charge. What angers me -angers me very, very much - is that there's absolutely no reference being made to the past of Mr Negroponte in Honduras during these hearings. We just don't hear anything about it. We do not learn from our history. The people of Iraq are going to be the ongoing victims of John Negroponte, who believes that the end justifies the means' 16 . Figure 5: This image, based upon the notorious picture of a hooded prisoner being subjected to extreme torture and barbaric maltreatment at Abu Ghraib, which informed the w hole world that the 'llluminis ed' US authorities are indeed in seemingly in the grip of evil forces, further displayed, in an 'in-your-face' manner, that they shamelessly model their behaviour in accordance with the reprobate methods that the US State Department routinely condemns in its annual compendium 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices'."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"16 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie Negroponte was subsequently, of course, select ed by President George W. Bush Jr. to serve as the Director of National Intellige nce, a new 'supremo' post created under the National Intelligence Reform Act, one-third of which is secret - so that the American population has no knowledge of what nefarious repressive provisions it contains - and which Mr Bush signed into law on 17th December 2004. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ALIBI: THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS Today, the United States operates internationally on the basis that the end justifies the means, which is the central precept of Illuminised Freemasonry as revealed by John Robison in 1798, promulgated by the 'father' of US Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Albert Pike, and as is routinely displayed by the actions and methodology of such hidden manifestations of Illuminism as Opus Dei [see Chapter 6]. Further authority for the statement that the United States operates interna tionally on the basis that the end justifies the means has helpfully been provided by a 'Pentagon consultant' who was interviewed, once again, by Seymour Hersh - who, in spite of his intelligence connections, remains one of the most respected and penetrating inv estigative journalists working today in the United States. In the same New Yorker interv iew on the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib atrocities, Mr Hersh reported that this 'consu ltant', who is clearly a military intelligence officer, told him candidly as follows: \"The White House subcontracted this to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon subcon- tracted it to [Stephen] Cambone.... This is Cambone's deal, but Donald Rumsfeld and [General Richard] Myers approved the program\". Hersh reported the 'Pentagon consultant ' as adding that 'when it came to the interrogation operation at Abu Ghraib... Rumsfeld left the details to Mr Cambone' (a military intelligence officer). 'Rumsfeld may not be personally culpable', the consultant added; and then Hersh again ci ted the source's words verbatim: \"But he's responsible for the checks and balances. The issue is that, since 9/11, we've changed the rules on how we deal with terrorism, and created condi tions where the end justifies the means'\" 17 - in accordance with the fundamenta l precept of the Illuminati. This assessment is corroborated by the best an alysts. In an assessment of the Yale Skull and Bones Society [see Chapter 2], of which Ge orge H. W. Bush is considered the chief Patriarch, and of which his son George W. is an adept, Kris Millegan wrote in 2003 that 'The Order of 322' is 'a multi-generational cult that believes in the power of death to bring about change, a group of Zeitgeist initiates believing that the end justifies the means, and uses massive deaths to feed their necromancy' 18 . That author gave two examples of how death is alleged to be consciously used to achieve 'revolutionary change', although the fomentation of foreign wars should perhaps have been his first choice here: 'As Governor of Texas, George W. Bush \"hung\" all prisoners sentenced to death that he had the opportunity to kill, except one, Henry Lee Lucas - a confessed serial killer for a shadowy cult. Bonesman and US political power-player Henry L. Stimson took the credit for talking President Truman into dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki', one of the most Satanic atrocities ever perpetrated. 'These are just two of the Order's death-dealing activities\" 19 . Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Ayatollah Khom eini, Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic (who, like Saddam Hussein, was a 'client' of US intelligence at one stage, until he was double-crossed by the Americans, or else double-crossed them ), and every other dictator under the sun, has found it convenient to take short cuts, on the basis that the end"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 17 justifies the means - thereby in the process decapitating the Rule of Law. Each of th ese monsters was involved in the occult and in secr et societies in one way or another, as is the case today in the case of leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Mahmoud Abbas (a.k.a. the founding Hamas terrorist Abu Mazen) and Colonel Qadhaffi. No matter what form occultic and Luciferian involvement may take, it has one product alone: death, both spiritual and physical. So it is logical that, specialising in death, practitioners should 'believe in the power of death to bring about change'. Now the United States has joined this parade of hideous tyrants and their tyrannies, in the pitch darkness. What has happened is that, just as US intelligence competes and at the same time colla borates with the covert ongoing Soviets to maximise the financial and revolutionary potential of global drug-trafficking operations (delivering death to cull the population in accordance with the Illumina ti's obsessive preference while generating annual proceeds now estimated at several trillions of dollars), and just as it has consorted with organised crime and has become criminalised, so has the Pentagon descended into the darkness, in comprehensive breach of inte rnational law, taking the view that it has no choice but to use the same tactics as its assumed enemies - although Al-Qaeda is in fact a bogus, stateless global revolutionary cooperative operation of international intelligence, the purpose of which is to 'leverage' the world through violence towards the New Underworld Order intended by the Illuminati: deploying the power of death to bring about 'change'. Al-Qaeda is their creation. This evil, occultically-derived, top-level consensus to allow th e end to justify the means has had disastrous consequences, with the United States having forfeited all respect and moral authority internationally - and now universally considered, even among large numbers of thinking Americans, to be the most dangerous country in the world. That this reputation is self-inflicted is a consequence of the supremacy of its criminalised intelligence community and of that community's self-acknowledged occult, Luciferian 'heart of darkness' in the service of the Illuminati. OPPRESSION ARISING FROM CONSORTING WITH FORCES OF EVIL President Bush II, like President Clinton befo re him, is in the habit of indulging in the Pharisaical habit of advertising his 'spiritual relationship' with the Lord. Prior to the Presidential Election in 2000, G. W. Bush's wi fe, Laura, asked about her husband's religious stance, said that in 1988, a friend had given him a 'daily Bible' (enabling the user to read the entire Bible every year, in 365 segments, a Scri pture reading method used for many years by this Author). Bill Clinton used to make a point of attending church with a Bible held in a camera-friendly position in his right hand, so that the words Holy Bible could clearly be seen. A psychiatrist has suggested that , for Mr Bush, his person, that of God and America, are all but one and the same. Specifically, Dr. Justin Frank, a prominent Washington psychiatrist and author of a book called Bush on the Couch: In side the Mind of the President, was reported by Capitol Hill sources on 29th July 2004 as explaining that President Bush suffered from what he called 'character pathology', includ ing 'grandiosity' and 'megalomania' - 'viewing himself, America and God as interchangeable'. The Capitol Hill source reported that the President was withdrawing more and more from aides and staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world in which only ardent loyalists we re then welcome. [For this Author's essay, on President Bush's psychology based on Dr Frank's book, see Addendum 4, page 681]. A political adviser told the same source that 'yes, there are growing concerns."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"18 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie The George W. Bush we see today' (towards the end of his First Term) 'is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful, and withdrawn' - hallmarks of those who consort with Lucifer. He was prescribed powerful antidepressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer questions about his former relationship with indicted (intelligence corporation) Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay. White House insiders were reported to have told the Legislative Branch source that the strong prescription medications appeared to have increased Mr Bush's sullen behaviour towards those around him. A staffer working for the House of Repres entatives' Speaker, Dennis Hastert, said: 'This is a President known for his ability to charm people one-on-one. Not any more'. In late July 2004, one of the few First Term close associates with continued access to the President was said to be the (former) Attorney General, John Ashcroft. Disloyal White House aides were alleged to have told the source that the two men 'believe they are on a mission from God'. However Figure 4 shows that President G.W Bush's allegiance is in fact to Lucifer. Members of the Pr esident's family repeated this Satanic gesture many times during the nine Inauguration balls held on 20th January. The illustrations in Addendum 9 on page 732 show that making Satanic signs is now all the rage in this 'New Age of Aquarius '. Space precludes showing all the available pictures of prominent people like members of President Bush's family signalling their allegiance to Satan, but those who have been photographed perpetrating this particular abomination include King Abdullah of Jordan, ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Prince Charles, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Tom Ridge, the former US Vice-President Dan Quayle, Elizabeth Taylor, General Tommy Franks, Senator John Edwards, Michael Jackson and the late self-styled high priest of Satan, Anton Szander LaVey. The identical salute appears in the Satanic Bible labelled Mano Cornuto, which signals allegiance between Satanism participants and their horned god. The former American witch, saved by the Grace of God, the Rev. David J Meyer, of Beaver Dam, WI, pointed out in March 2005 that the appalling Reuters News Service photograph of Mrs Laura Bush displaying this Satanic salute with her right hand during the 2005 Inauguration ceremonies, also included the President standing next to her giving the same signal with his left hand in a pointing position - a sign that means 'cursed be' in the occult. So, no doubt remains that those in charge of our affairs in the United States, Britain and Italy were/are covert followers of Satan who are no longer even ashamed to dis guise this fact, even though both the British Prime Minister and the US President continue simultaneously to attend church services from time to time. The Devil is the author of confusion, and, like Mr Bush, he's been having a ball 20 . An environment in which such forces are at work is bound to be characterised by recriminations, sourness and confusion, since, as the author of confusion, the Devil delights in the creation of conditions for the maximisation of lies and chaos. Glimpses of such a torpid atmosphere at the very highest levels of the US Government were evident during the run-up to the Presidential Election in 2004. Tom Ridge, then Homeland Security Secretary, was reported be spending hardly any time at all with the President, and was said to be receiving 'most of his ma rching orders' from John Ashcroft, who was then in charge of the US Department of 'Justice'. 'Some people on Ridge's staff gripe privately that Ashcroft is 'Bush's Himmler\", referring to Hitler's SS Chief. And one senior US Homeland Security aide went much further: 'Too many', he said, 'make the mistake of thinking that Dick Cheney"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 19 is the real power in the Bush Administ ration. They're wrong. It's Ashcroft, and that is reason enough for all of us to be very , very afraid'. In the same report it was just as inaccurately elaborated that the US Secr etary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, had fallen out of favour and had informed his own staff that 'no matter what happens in November, I'm outta here'. It was thou ght that perhaps his practice of stand- ing for ten hours a day at his stand-up desk, ha d finally left him exhausted, as well as disillusioned 20 . As it turned out, both assessments were (typically) based upon deliberately diversionary disinformation and lies, perhap s to shift attention away from the intended retention of power by the two most prominent and ruthless figures in the Administration, and for the immediate future: Messrs Rumsfeld and Cheney. In June 2005, President Bush Jr. was re ported to have intended to close down the 'Gulag'-type camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, presumably because of impending legal cases that were likely to cause the Administra tion embarrassment, only to have been informed by Mr Cheney that this remained out of the question - revealin g, of course, that the top intelligence officer serving as Vice President tells the President of the United States what to do. John Ashcroft left the Administration, Mr Cheney stayed as Vice President, and Donald Rumsfeld, fresh from having establis hed his super-secret St rategic Support Group (SSG), an internal Defense Department intelligence service, remained en poste, to finalise any further aggressive moves that may then have been at the planning stage. And all reports about the President's questionable mental and medical condition vanished during and after the campaign. While these First Term insights will long since have been forgotten, the sig- nificance, for our purposes, of these reports a bout the atmosphere within the innermost presidential circle in the late summer of 200 4, should not be overlooked.

President George W. Bush's Satanic gest ures during the evening Inauguration fes- tivities were entirely consistent with the genera lly occult nature of those events. The very word Inauguration comes from augur, meaning one who is invested with occult omens. The event took place on 20th January, a significant witchcraft date. The cited former US astrologer and witch who is well equipped to provide accurate interpretations of contemporary manifestations of Luciferianis m and Satanism among our leaders and false role models, reports that 'as a former astrologer saved by the Grace of God, I can tell you that astrology is the time-clock of the Illuminati' (explaining President Reagan's obsession with it, influenced in part by his wife Nancy) 'and it is impossible to practise witchcraft without if. 'On the 20th day of each month, the sun cr osses from one sign to the next as it travels through the so-called 'houses of the heavens'. The 12 astrolog ical signs make up the wheel of the year, or, as witches call it, 'the wheel of fortune'. The passages of the sun from one occult astrological sign to the next are calle d transitions, and th e most important of the 12 transitions is 20th January - because the sun travels from Capricorn, the occult sign of the goat, into Aquarius, the 11th sign and the haven of the new age of Antichrist'. In anticipation of this event, the former witch who recorded all this wrote: 'Yes, it happens on Inauguration Day! This is the day when the President, with some religious leader standing next to him, will be invested with the spirits of Aquarius while he stands at the West Front of the US Capitol, and faces the ancient Egyptian obelisk, known as the (phallic) Washington Monument. This is an occult ceremony of the first magnitude' 21 . PRESIDENT REAGAN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER 12333 Invoking the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, President Ronald Reagan promulgated Executive Order 12333 on 4th December 1981 entitled 'United States Intelligence Activities'. This Executive Order authorised t he establishment by US intelligence oper atives and cadres of corporations owned by the US Government for intelligence purposes, and prescribed that their intelligence community connections may be denied. The relevant text (language) reads as follows: 2.7. Contracting: Agencies within the Intelligence Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the sponsorship of such contracts or arran geme nts for author iz e d intelligence purposes'. This provision covers the establishment of onshore or o ffshore corporations by American intelligence operatives from any of the 18+ agenci es 'controlled' by the Central Intelligence Agency and also such US intelligence organisations as are not supervised by the CIA, which is subordinate to the National Security Agency (NSA) in practice, and now to the new Director of National Intelligence (Mr John Negroponte as at mid-2006). The corporations established under Executive Order 12333 and any relevant subsequent presidential order and legislation, are referred to as as Title 18, Section 6 corporations. There are several thousand of these, many of which have bank accounts containing substantial accruals belonging to the US Government. In part because of serious rivalry between different warring groups wi thin the enormous US intelligence community, the colossal offshore fund accruals belonging to the US Government were waiting in mid-2006 for the legal environment to be adjusted to facilitate their repatriation to the US Treasury, and for funds stolen by various parties to be traced. ■"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 21 In a subsequent report, the Rev. Meyer, the former witch, elaborated as follows: 'In the occult practice of astrology, Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac and the sign of the new age of Lucifer. We also know that in the occult, the number 5 is the number of death. This 2005 Inauguration is the 55th in auguration, and the President will take his omens, which is what 'inaug urate' means, while facing the Washington Monument, which is 555 feet high. The dais, which is the raised platform from which the President will be speaking is surrounded by semi-circular seating which is designed to look like a mystical Egyptian phoenix with raised wings. The phoenix bird is the symbol of the New Age and the New World Order.... The Inauguration sp eech [was] given at precisely 12.00 noon. According to witchcraft and astrology, this is the very moment when the sun transits into the 11th sign of Aquarius.... The President's speech [was about] peace and freedom for the entire world, with the inference that he is the man who will bring it to pass. The occult timing and surrounding circumstances of this entire inaugural event are amazing. In the midst of a war and with a heavy military presence in Washington, DC, the President wants to be known as a man of peace. Countless thousands have been killed and are being killed with this so-called 'peace'. Thus, this man of false peace will begin speaking at the moment Aquarius rises, and Aquarius is th e water sign of peace in witchcraft' . If President G.W. Bush had really been fami liar with Scripture, by reading every day, as his wife told a TV audience he had been doing since 1988, he would be aware of the two warnings in Jeremiah against those who say 'Peace, peace, when there is no p eace' 23 . He would also have been familiar with these verses of Isaiah: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!' 'Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!' 24 There is a parallel manifestation of this degree of darkness at the highest levels of Figure 7: A decidedly powerful (but partially obscured) geomasonic handshake between the former Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, left, and the Palestinian Aut hority President Mahmoud Abbas - the 'former' Hamas terrorist Abu Mazen - at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on 8th February 2005.

A Member of Parliament known to the Author was among several MPs who noticed, during his years as a backbencher during Blair's first term, that in certain circumstances, the face of British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, appeared demonic 25 ; on a separate occasion, a source reported that he had noticed that on occasion, Blair's eyes are pitch black; and a cartoon published in The Times in early September 2004 [Figure 6], reconfirmed that media observers have also noticed this. It is alleged that the Blairs were present at some sort of pagan rite during a visit to Mexico. This lends special significance to a 2004 report in The Mail on Sunday (London), to the effect that Tony Blair had instructed civil servants that witches, Druids and pagan worshippers were to be given a say in official policy. David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, was reported to have established a Whitehall bureau at a cost of about £1.0 million of British taxpayers' money, which had met representatives from such groups. The unit takes the view that 'accurate info rmation' about paganism must be made universally available, especially to children 26 . The Blair-appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, is known as th e Archdruid of Canterbury, given that his first public act prior to his consecration was to undergo a widely publicised induction into a high Druidic Degree, at a pagan ceremony in Wales - thereby of course sowing confusion and chaos in the minds of susceptible people as to what the Church of England worships. In February 2005, the reprobate British Fabian Government, aware that the exploitation of sexuality is an efficient paganising conduit, presided over a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Month, in the course of which secondary schoolchildren in England were 'taught' about historical figu res and their deviant se xuality. Naturally, the organisers of this abomination claimed hypocritically that it was aimed at combating homophobic bullying in UK schools 27 . On 24th October 2004, a BBC news programme reported that the Captain of HMS Cumberland, located at Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, had allowed a naval technician, Chris Cranmer, to register as a Satanist 28 . This fellow purported to be a follower of the Church of Satan, founded in San Francisco in 1996, by its high priest, the late Anton LaVey. Indicating where the British military Establishment now stands with regard to demonic activity, a 'politically cor-rect', pontificating spokesman for the Royal Navy observed snootily: 'We are an equal opportunities employer and we don't stop anybody from having their own religious values'. On the same level of crass official ignorance and arrogance was a report in June 2006 that UK Home Office staff are being allowed to take less ons in witchcraft. It has almost always been the case that Go vernments are in the hands of Satan -even though, given our free will and the availability of the spiritual Free Gi ft of Grace to those who take the first genuine step towards repentance, as outlined above, this is not in fact inevitable. The English King Henry VI, founder of Eton College and King's College Cambridge, both glorious religious establishments, was clearly not in the hands of Satan, as any sensitive Old Etonian familiar with English history and with the perfection of Eton College Chapel and its worship, understand s. It appears that, very occasionally and exceptionally, power may devolve into hands that are not drenched in blood or otherwise sullied by abominable past behaviour. Nevertheless, the reality that governance is typically to be found in the hands of Lucifer and his Workers of Darkness was confirmed during and by the Temptation of Christ, from which we learn that Satan has power over ALL Governments:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 23 'Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 'And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me'. 'Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hen ce, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve'. 'Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him' 29 . Note, first, that ALL the kingdoms of the world were (are) in the hands of Satan. And note, secondly, that when Jesus told Satan to leave him, Satan did precisely that - the point being that if we order him out, he departs: a remarkable fact that can yet give hope to those in thrall to Satan, including many of those so identified in this book. In one of his great speeches, recounted in Th e Acts of the Apostles, Paul reiterates how Jesus Christ had intervened in his life on the road to Damascus saying, amid the glory of His bright light, in the Hebrew tongue, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 30 - and had commissioned him, after his conversion: 'To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiv eness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me' 31 . For as long as the United States and Britain are led by men who falsely represent that they profess the Christian faith, but in reality walk in pitch darkness, and inflict death and destruction 'without flinching', because of th eir twisted belief in the power of death to bring about 'change', these two formerly civilised but now deeply decadent countries' barbaric contribution to the deterioration of international conditions will continue to escalate. It was particularly telling that both President Bush and Tony Blair have repeatedly professed to be Christians. They were and are greatly deluded, and in deluding themselves, they lie to the whole world. If they or their successors continue to prepare and perform Works of Darkness on the scale so far exhibited, the consequences for humanity will indeed ultimately be catastrophic. Apart from the genuine Saul-like repentance and transformation of our leaders' personal lives that is urgently necessary, a fi rst practical step towards the restoration of stability and avoidance of catastrophe would be for certain over-powerful, arrogant and wayward intelligence services to be ordered back into their ghettos, for their ranks to be decimated of free-wheeling planners and workers of darkness, for their criminal intelligence operations to be deprived of legal protection, and for a definitive code of conduct to be imposed by statute upon the entire intelligence community, br eaches of which will be met with the full force of the law. In the United States, this would mean repealing the National Security Act et seq., which legislation collectiv ely established a criminals' charter, and for Executive Order 12333 [see the vox on page 20 ] to be repealed, as well. The protection afforded by legislation and Presidential d ecree for US intelligence operatives to commit crimes with impunity -the only rule being not to get caught - needs to be cancelled. As matters stand, US intelligence relies ferociously upon the law whenever a cover-up is required - while at the same time serially breaking both domestic and international law with impunity. A second useful step would be for US policymakers to take a profound policy decision to STOP fretting about the assumed energy shortage in years to come. It is likely that if the United States had not invaded Iraq, the Iraqi regime would have proceeded with the multiple energy contracts that it was in the process of negotiating and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"24 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie concluding with the oil companies of over 30 nations 32,33 ; and the oil which, as a con- sequence of the invasion, did not come on stream, would have been forthcoming earlier. If the United States had been genuinely interested, as its propaganda professed, in securing a stable supply of oil for the wh ole world, rather than in real ity conveying the impression of greedily seeking the control of all Iraqi oil fo r itself, oil prices would arguably not have risen so steeply from mid-2004, and the so-called 'peak oil' crisis about which so much has been written, would not have been accentuated. The third necessary reform, indeed a prere quisite for the decriminalisation of the US intelligence sector, albeit a symbolic one , would be for the CIA to remove its lying Langley slogan, since it obviously cannot face completi ng the quotation. Unfortunately, information such as that which is to follow will be liable to preclude any clean-up of the criminalised US intelligence services' general modus operandi, since those driving strategy consider that they are engaged, on behalf of the American people, in a life-or-death struggle fo r the survival of the United States and its economy, given the nation's long-term energy re quirements. At least, this is how those concerned may rationalise their actions and ruthless behaviour. Beyond these self- evident considerations lurks the even more sinister reality that the United States is in the hands of Illuminists (who are Luciferians), whose own very long-established modus operandi is based on the principl e of synarchy - or government by secret societies, as will be explained in Chapter 2 et sea. The complic ation which arises as a consequence of this subversive state of affairs can be simply explained as follows: when the American people go to the polls, they innocently believe (leaving aside their knowledge of political corruption and pork-barrel DC politics) that they are electing a President, a Vice- President, Congressmen and Senators whose exclusive remit will be to serve the interests of the US electorate - whereas, given the synarc hy dimension, the reality is that they wind up electing powerful and blackmailable member s of the synarchy cliques, most of whom are intelligence officers, and all of whom work together at a certain level (while simultaneously competing with each other on a lower plane). In other words, the American people are living in a dreamworld. A revolution, or rather what can more accurately be termed a 'coup d'etat by instal- ments', has taken place recently within the ol d republican structures established by the Masonic American Revolution itself. As the Danish philosopher Kirkegaard pointed out, the most successful revolution s are those which take place within the framework of the ancien regime. That is what has taken place in th e United States. Although a sizeable minority of its highly intelligent people, t hought to amount to a constituen cy of some five million, recognises that the nation faces the worst cris is of its existence, the majority of the population have no grasp of the reality that the Rule of Law has collapsed - given that powerful figures who have stolen billio ns of dollars and have murdered hundreds of Americans, go unpunished, and that the American version of democracy is now reduced to a decadent means of changing personnel alone, with real power res ting in the hands of the corrupt synarchists, whose identity will in part be reviewed in this book. Concerning the collapse of the Rule of Law, the United States, having inherited English Common Law, retains ancient legal pr inciples called Misprision of Treason and Misprision of Felony. What these mean is that anyone subject to US jurisdiction who is aware that treason and felonies (like stealing billions of dollars, or more) have been committed, is committing a crime by failing to pass such information to the author ities. But if the authorities themselves are complicit, the Rule of Law has collapsed."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 25 U.S. ECONOMIC POWER DEPENDE NT UPON DOLLAR SUPREMACY It is of course well understood that US global power, analysed conventionally without taking into account the secret hidden strength of the vast European money power, depends upon two key props: overwhelming military power, and the continued unchallenged supremacy of the US dollar. After the calmer years that followed the Second World War and the Bretton Woods settlement, under which the US dollar was convertible into gold, and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were established - and which marked the restart of the global collective governance process - the postwar economic and financial settlement began to break down as the European economies recovered, becoming strong exporters by the late 1960s 34 . As the growing economic strength of Europe coincided with President Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War - demanded by the US military-industrial complex and the CIA following Johnson's installation after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (believed to have been engineered by Abwe hr /DVD operatives in the US intelligence community itself) - the United States incurred soaring public sector deficits. While this process helped the establishment of the Eurodollar market, throughout the 1960s, President de Gaulle demanded to be paid for French exports to the United States in gold, rather than in the Federal Reserve's pa per currency. By novem-ber 1967, the drain of gold from official US and Bank of England vaults had reached critical proportions. After Britain had to devalue the pound, during its 'sick man of Europe' phase, the French and other central banks stepped up their demand for gold in exchange for their dollar reserves. Their accurate calculation wa s that, given the squandering of vast financial resources in Vietnam - a syndrome which the Bush Administration is now repeating, with consequences which will certai nly be as dramatic in due course - it would only be a matter of months before the United States, like Britain earlier, would itself be compelled to devalue its dollar against gold; so they all resolved to demand payment in gold at the prevailing higher fixed price. By May 1971, the drain of US official gold had become so alarming that even the Bank of England now sided with the Banque de France in demanding US gold for its holdings of dollars. That was the advanced stage at which, rather than risk the disappearance of the United States' entire stock of official gold, the Nixon Administration decided to abandon the link with gold entirely, moving to a unilaterally declared system of floating currencies in August 1971. This rash decision provided relief over the short and medium term, but has predictably result ed in the accumulation of intractable longer- term financial problems caused by fiat money creation and manipulation, with a derivatives overhang by 2006 of $770 trillion. In practice the consequence of this 'Bre ak with the Past' was that control over monetary policy was further privatised, with the large international banks assuming the role that the central banks had exercised under the gold standard, but entirely without gold. It was presupposed that the constant interaction of market forces alone would stabilise the foreign exchange markets and would ensure that a runaway fiat money system did not develop hyperinflationary characteristics. Market forces duly rose to the new challenge. The free floating of the US dollar, which compelled all the leading currencies to float against it - together with the escalation of OPEC oil prices in 1973 by 400% after the Yom Kippur War - triggered the petrodollar recycling phase of the slow- burning crisis, and of the United States' precarious global hegemony."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"26 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie The first oil shock suddenly created a colossal demand for the floating dollar. All oil importing countries faced the problem of how to export in dollars in order to pay their expensive new energy import bills. At a secret meeting organised by the globalist (Illuminati-sponsored) Bilderberg organisation held during May 1971 in Saltsjoebaden, Norway the petrodollar recycling strategy that was duly adopted in 1973, was prelanned and finalised - which clearly implies that the oil 'shock' was contrived to leverage and exploit the severance of the US dollar from gold (as this Author and certain others thought was the case at the time). The primary operative behind this strategy was the Illuminist renegade Jew of German extraction and alleged triple agent, with his heavy German accent, Dr Henry Ki ssinger (allegedly expelled from his US Jewish congregation), who invented the phrase 'recycling of petrodollars'. With OPEC suddenly choking on dollars th at it could not use, US and British banks moved on cue to absorb the dollars and to onlend them as Eurodollar bonds or loans, especially to the Third World countries desperate to borrow US dollars to finance their oil imports. The Author's own journal Interna tional Currency Review followed the progress of these phases of the crisis in successive issues, accurately predicting that the whole process would implode, as indeed happened in the early 1980s. Colossal volumes (by the standards of those days) of US dollars were recycled between OPEC, the London and New York banks, and then back to Third Wo rld countries. The international financial community and its transnational institutions have been unwinding or adding to this sovereign debt glut ever since. The Third World debt crisis was finally triggered after Mr Paul Volcker's US Federal Reserve Board had unilaterally escalated US interest rates to record levels, in order to 'save' the dollar. After three years of these stupendous interest rates, the US dollar was 'saved', but the entire developing sector of the world economy found itself burdened by usurious US interest rat es charged on their vast petrodollar loans Note: Observe that the serial number below - C32132 1321C - sums to 666 and that the serial number at the top right - C123123123C - sums likewise to 666. This is the number of the Vatican. Figure 8: This image, and Figure 9, show the front and reverse of a US Treasury Diamond Certificate, with face value of $1.0 billion. The reason for its tattered appearance is that it was evidently held in the billfold of a prominent solicitor located in Singapore, who allegedly attempted to trade it at a discount with other corrupt parties. The details underlying this relevant scandal are omitted here because the point of showing this Diamond Certificate is to illustrate how US oil imports ar e financed.

To enforce debt repayment both to buttress the dollar system and so as to prevent the nations of the 'south' from acquiring any degree of economic independence, the Lon don and New York banks called in the services of their creature, the International Monetary Fund, to act as their 'debt policeman'. Public expenditure for health, education and welfare was slashed on the IMF's instructions, in order to ensure that the loan capitalist banks could rely on receiving timely repayments on the loaned petrodollars. They had found that lending to countries was easy, since the Third World debt managers did not treat the debt they incurred professionally - given that it was sovereign debt, not their own. In 1973, David Rockefeller (a senior Illuminist) and other operatives relaunched the Trilateral Commission, an old Abwehr front, in order to take special account of the emergence of Germany's ally, Japan, as a major industrialised nation, and a massive importer of oil. One idea was to ensure that Japanese trade surpluses from exports would be deployed to buy oil in dollars (not in pounds sterling French francs or Japanese yen). The remaining Japanese surpluses were held in US Treasury bonds, to earn interest. The Group of Seven (G-7) was further established to hold Japan and Western Europe inside the dollar system. From time to time in the 1980s, International Currency Review and various prominent voices in Japan called for three reserve currencie s (the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the deutschemark) to share the global reserve function. But thanks to US pressure exerted inter alia by the mechanisms described above, this never happened: the dollar remained dominant, and the crisis was contained - for the time being. In the mid-1970s, International Currency Review exposed the existence of what the Author called the secret Saudi-American Agr eement, established in June 1974 by the US Treasury Secretary of the day, William Simon, and Dr Kissinger. It was to be held in place through the establishment of the US-Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation, the full statute of which was published in the Author's journal. Figure 9: Say that the US Bureau of Engraving and Prin ting reproduces 64 of these Diamond Certificates up on one sheet. Each sheet is 'worth' $64 billion. However the actual cost of producing each sheet is, shall we say, $1,000 (being very generous, and adding-in all of the Bureau' s costs and overheads). Each sheet therefore costs the United States $1,000. But when placed at the disposal of oil producers, the total purchasing value of the s heet is $64 billion. This trick only 'w orks' if petroleum is universal ly invoiced in US dollars."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"28 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie This exclusively revealed that the spedal arrangement entailed Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer, selling it s oil exclusively for dollars, an d that the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve Bank (as the Treasury's agent) would facilitate the purchase of US Treasury bonds with Saud i petrodollars. Specifically, the New York Fed would telephone the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) to advise of an upcoming marketing exercise for US Treasury securities, indicating what volume of securities (say, $3.0 b illion) would be announced to the market, and asking whether SAMA wished to purch ase any 'add-on' US securities. These would be sold 'privately' ('off the books') for Saudi petrodollars, but were not irredeemables: the Saudis could, if they so wished (which did not at first happen) dispose of such securities in the New York financial marketplace. This arrangement followed an early attempt by the US authorities to persuade the Saudis to buy irredeemables. After about $ 640 million of such US Treasur y paper had been acquired, SAMA's advisers, White Weld, suggested to the Riyadh author ities that it would not be a good idea to buy any more. IRAQ INVOICES FOR ITS OIL IN EUROS AND IS DECAPITATED The convention (enforced inter alia by the a bove mechanisms) that oil is sold and paid for globally in dollars, demands the buildup of colossal trade surpluses in order to accumulate dollar surpluses to finance oil bills. It is still the case that 70% of world trade is transacted dollars. These days, with its huge deficits, the United States must import at least $1.5 billion daily in order to avoi d a dollar collapse and to keep its interest rates low enough to support the debt-burdened corporate economy. The net debts of the corporate and official sector s have been deteriorating at an horrific pace. But on 1st November 2000, Radio Liberty/RFE broadcast a report headlined 'I RAQ : B AGHDAD MOVES TO E URO '. The wire was picked up for barely 48 hours by CNN and other media, but then abruptly dropped. The Iranian authorities had also been openly debating in early 2000 the merits of switching th eir oil exports to the Euro. Following the bursting of the dot.com bubble, the unravelling of that intelligence community scam called Enron, and the Worldcom finance scandal, all associated with recessionary trends as well as with rapacious intelligence scamming operations, the dollar began to lose its attraction for foreign inv estors. With France and Germany preparing to block war in the UN Security Council, rumours surfaced that the central banks of Russia and China had quietly starte d dumping US dollars and purchasing Euros. Whenever he needs to exert latent pressure on the United States, GRU-President Putin starts talking about making greater use of the Euro. For 'weapons of mass destruction' in the 2003 Iraq War context, read the threat that ot hers would follow Iraq and shift into Euros, destroying overnight the United States' currency, economy and global economic hegemony. As one US economist put it, the ending of the dollar's reserve role would be a 'catastrophe' for the United States. Interest rates would have to be raised higher than Paul Volcker's 17% level in 1979 - a dollar cr isis which resulted directly from steps by France, Germany and Saudi Arabia to start selling US Treasury bonds. The decapitation of Iraq therefore represented a crude reversion by the United States to the use of its military power to maintain the hegemony of the dollar system. But as this brief summary indicates, the underlying dollar strategy is extremely fragile. The crude intent behind the use of military power is to acquire direct control over oil resources, so that the issue of oil denomination in another currency cannot"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 29 realistically arise in the future. The attack on and occupation of Iraq served as a crude warning to any other states, such as Iran, which were considering switching to the use of the Euro for their energy export business. While the lesson will certainly have been learned regionally, there also remains the obvi ous danger that China and other countries could unilaterally decide to pay for their imported oil in their own currencies, rather than in dollars. If oil exporters were again to start invoicing in a currency other than the dollar, and oil importers started to remit payment in their own currencies, America would soon learn that while it is the largest economy and military power in the world, it is not bigger than the Rest of the World. Under President G. W. Bush Jr., America's attempts to procure de facto control over foreign oil resources have been frustrated ev erywhere: in Russia, in Venezuela and, so far, in Iraq, where the oil sector has remained under the threat and reality of sabotage. For this reason, the Author anticipated, in a report published in February 2005, that, irrespective of the consequences, the Bush II Administration would be tempted to mount further military operations. That may have been one reason why his ally, Tony Blair, called a UK General Election one full year earlie r than was constitutionally necessary - in case he became embroiled in 'another Iraq'. Sophisticates and cynical intelligence officers will tell you that the way they do things is 'the way of the world', and that to urge improvements in behaviour, as the Author does in this work, and has done in several conversations with senior US intell- igence officers, is pointless, meaningless, and naive. For, apart from anything else, 'the way of the world' dictates that in order to avoid economic meltdown, the United States must maintain the hegemony of the US dollar at all costs. Figures 8 and 9 on pages 26 and 27 show a US Treasury Diamond Certificate worth $1.0 billion. The Diamond Certificate is displayed here in order to illustrate at this juncture the essence of the crisis which the US strategi sts consider that Am erica faces, although one needs to bear in mind all the time that, as indicated above, the US national interest is always subordinated by the synarchists to their own plans for global hegemony and the close control of the world's assets in the interests of 'the Brotherhood of Man' - which represents not what it appears to imply, but rather the self-interested Brotherhood of the Geomasonic Illuminists themselves. The cost to the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing of one sheet containing, say, 64 Diamond Certificates wo rth $1.0 billion each, is of the order of, say, $1,000 - being generous, if one takes into account the Bureau's labour costs and overheads, the cost of engraving, special paper and inks, machine running time, the guillotining and finishing processes, and all the other costs which th e Author, as a Master Printer himself, necessarily knows about. Thus for a total cost not exceeding, say, $1,000, and probably much less, the US Government has created $64 billion of 'value'. Therefore, for each printed Certificate, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is 'creating' wealth worth $999,999,000 out of thin air. These US Diamond Certificates are delivered into the hands of, or for the account of, oil producers, in exchange for the oil imported from them by the United States. So if the United States owes the Saudi Arabian Government $10 billion in settlement of outstanding oil invoices, it can settle these oil bills inter alia by making ten $1.0 billion Di amond Certificates available for account of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). Once in SAMA's hands, the Diamond Certificates acquire 'actual' value (i.e., real buying power), both wi thin the 'closed' intergovernmental financial system, and ultimately in the 'open' sector. For this trick to remain valid, the US"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"30 C HAPTER 1: The Langley Lie dollar must remain the currency in which all oil invoices and payments are denominated. For if powerful countries were to abandon this oil-dollar standard, and to begin paying for their imported oil in their own or in other national currencies, such as the Euro, the pound sterling or the Japanese yen, the ability of the United States to pay for its imported energy requirements by printing such pieces of paper, would be challenged, seriously jeopardised, or terminated. This is because if, all of a sudden, the Saudis were to demand payment in Euros (which would not occur under prevailing conditions, given the ongoing Saudi-American relationship), the United States would need, all of a sudden, to obtain the necessary Euros on the foreign exchanges, which might necessitate transferring real wealth (dollars) in exchange for the Euros, rather than handing over Diamond Certificates specially printed for the purpose. The oil-dollar system might continue to function fitfully; but the threat of it collapsing is a national security issue of such gravity that the United States is prepared to go so far as to attack and invade any oil-pr oducer which might be brazen enough to demand payment for its exported oil in any currency ot her than the dollar. Of course, this is far from a complete or even an adequate expl anation of the phenomenon of the oil-dollar standard. But at least it explains why the intelligence services attach the highest priority to serving the interests of the US oil co rporations, and are mandated to place their interests first. It should also be noted, in the light of what follows, that the serial numbers that are shown on the Diamond Certificate illustrated on pages 26 and 27 devolve to 666 (123+123+123 = 666), which is of course a primary occultic Kabbalistic number, as indicated in the Book of Revelation. Therefore, this specific Illuminati code is displayed by the US Government to its foreign counterpart, which, being likewise Illuminised, recognises the code and its significance. Enough has been reviewed here to make it clear that the slogan at Langley is indeed as deceitful and misleading as was explained at the outset. The intelligence community deals not in the truth, but in lies and deception. Its rationale has been the same down the centuries: national security. But control by criminalised, Illuminised intelligence is incompatible with good governance, however pressing the pretext. ■ Chapter 1: THE LANGLEY LIE: Notes and references: 1. Biblical quotations throughout are taken from the King James Authorised Version of the Holy Bible. 2. The notion that we choose Christ, which is dispens ed by false prophets, is erroneous. We cannot 'decide for Christ' without the desire to k now the truth being 'given us of the Father'. He calls us, not the other way round: and He does this as soon as we make the first move of our own free will, which we have to exercise first (because He gave us free will). In John, Chapter 15, Jesus tells his disciples plainly: 'Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you'. If we are 'in the Word' - that is, reading Scripture (which is essential), however imperfectly - and are tr ying (however inadequately) to follow hi s Way and Truth to Life, it is a fact that 'whatsoever we ask of the Father' in Jesus' name, He gives it to us. Obviously it is no use asking for a new Mercedes: we have to ask for what is in accordance with His will. 'If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you' [John, Chapter 15, verse 7]. 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened' [Matthew, Chapter 7, ve rses 7-8]. An American friend and the Author prayed jointly for a young woman (unknown to the Aut hor), who was so ill that her family had been called to her hospital bedside. She began her complete recovery at the very moment of our prayer. The explanation was that what was asked for was 'in His Name' and in accordance with His Will. It is a waste of time asking the Father for whatever is not in accordance with his Will, which, through Grace - a freel y given gift of the Lord that follows our submission with a contrite, humble and tender heart - is made known to us. 3.

The Soviet re volutionary meaning of 'convergence' is: 'con-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 31 vergence on our terms', meaning that the West is required to 'converge' substantively with the covert Soviet Union, whereas any 'convergence' of the covert Soviet Union is to be cosmet ic only. Hence, as anyone who is not sitting on their brains can see for themselves, Russian 'privatisation' devolved the assets of the Party-State into the hands of selected GRU and KGB operatives, from whose hands the assets are being extracted piecemeal under the Presidency of the senior Soviet M ilitary Intelligence (GRU) officer, Vladimir Putin. Under the present phase of the Soviet long-range strategy, the USSR is essentially 'marking time' while the West's politico-social system (in both Europe and the United States) evolves into a de facto communised, collectivised clone of the 'former' Soviet system. 5. The Soviet Union is always qualified in this and all related works by the adjective 'former' in parentheses. The Author is Editor and publisher of Soviet Analys t, which monitors the continued existence of the Soviet Union in practice. For further details, see the Author's book The European Union Co llective: Enemy of its Member States' [Edward Harle Limited, London and New York, 2002], which explains the parallel Soviet and pan-German agendas for a collectivised Europe, a scheme which is now at an ad vanced stage of decrepi tude. As revealed by a US operative to the Author and mentioned in the present work, Mikhail Sergeyevich Go rbachev (real name Orbach or Korbach) remains head (as of 2006) of the KGB Continuum. 6. Seymour M. Hersh, 'The Gray Zone: How a Secret Pentagon Program came to Abu Ghraib, Annals of National Security', The New Yorker, 24th May 2004. The 'former' intelligence operative 'blew' the 'Black' operation in question by revealing outline details to Hersh. Whenever such revelations surface in the 'mainstream' m edia, it is usually because the intelligence authorities concerned ha ve wound up the programme, and replaced it with a successor programme. However intelligence duplicity being what it is, it is conceivable in this instan ce that the SAP cont inues, but that the revelations to Hersh in this article simply conveyed the fals e impression that it had been wound up. If that was the case, it will certainly have been replaced by a comparable SAP 'Black' programme. Reports co ntinue (as of June 2006) to emerge of atrocities at the 23 secret US intelligence facilities in Afghanistan, in the multiple such evil centres in Iraq, Jordan, the British colony of Diego Garcia, and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 7. As probably a 'former' intelligence official himself, Hersh would know perfectly well that the use of t he prefix 'former' in this context is cosmetic. US citizens are not allowed to divulge the identitie s of existing US intelligence officers. But there is no such individual as a 'for mer' intelligence operative, because they all know too much and have to be monitored and 'handled' for their lifetime. One of the problems facing the implementers of US and New Underworld Order operations since the Re agan era is that timetabl es have slipped ba dly. This has meant that significant numbers of ageing operatives remain 'operative' and 'o n the books'. These people have long si nce been 'read into' (to use the CIA euphemism for 'indoctrinated into') geopolit ical operations of such complexity and ongoing relevance, t hat they 'cannot be released'. Many of the individuals m entioned in this book are, or soon w ill be, past normal 'retirement age'. The primary reason for their continued involv ement in multiple operations is that they alone are 'fully read into' 'Black' operations which it would be too hazardous or dangerous to reveal to others. Some of the hazards concern the systematic rifling of financial assets by intelligence operatives and 'barons' themselves. 8.

According to documents extracted by legal process by Judicial Watch, Washington DC, from the Cheney Energy Task Force, the countries listed in Note 33 below (with their energy corporat ions in parenthes es) were in various stages of negotiating for rights, carrying out exploration work, constructing facilities, or otherwise preparing to exploit Iraqi oil, as of 5th March 2001. Alt hough the Energy Task Force is commonly referred to as the 'Cheney Energy Task Force', detailed research work along these lines had long been under way during the Clinton era - illustrating a key point emerging from this analysis, namely that political 'opposites' in t he 'White' world, being cont rolled by the intelligence services, since the most senior posts are usually held by intelligence operatives, are actually 'on the same page' -just playing opposite ends of the political dialectic for public consumption in the 'White' world. Thus: Clinton and the Democratic Party, extensivel y penetrated by Communists and fellow-travellers = Thesis; Bush II, driven by the 'German' element of the intelligence services following the Hi mmler Nazi tradition = Antithesis (or vice versa). Repeated cycles of the Hegelian dialectic (which is itself based upon the occult-Masonic concept of the 'mechanistic world') continue until the Synthesis (= One World Government, or the New Underworld Order) is achieved. However, since these forces are driven by Satan, who is the author of all confusion, the Synthesis is of course never actually realised This illustrates that these people are all fools. Their be lief in the geomasonic mechanistic world guarantees this. The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good, God looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God. Everyone one of them is gone back: they are altoge ther become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one'. Psalm (of Davi d) 53, verses 1-3. 33. The countries (with their energy corporations in parentheses) that were identified by the Cheney Energy Task Force as being in various stages of negotiating for rights, ca rrying out exploration work, constructing facilities, or otherwis e preparing to exploit Iraqi oil as of 5th March 2001, all of which lost out due to the invasion, were as follows: Algeria (Sonatrach); Australia (BHP); Canada (Ranger, Bow Canada, Alberta Energy, CanOxy, Chavco Resources, Escondido, Talisman, IPC, PanCanadian); China (CNPC, Norinco, Sinochem); Czech Republic (Strojexport); Finland (Neste Oy); France (Total Elf Aquitaine), Forasol SA, IBEX, Perenco); Germany (D eminex, Preussag, Slavneft); Gree ce (Kriti); Hungary (Hanpetro); India (ONGC, Reliance); Indonesia (Pertamina); Ireland (Bula); Ita ly (Agip, Snamprogetti); Japan (Japex, Mitsubishi); Malaysia (Petronas); Mexico (Pemex); Netherlands (Larmag, Dutch Ro yal Shell); Norway (Statoil); Pakistan (Cresc ent); Romania (Petrom, Mol); Russia (Kond Pe troleum, Lukoil, Zarube zneft, Mashinoimport, Tatarneft, Rostneft, Sidanc o); South Korea (Sangyong, Samsung, Pedco, Hambo, Yukong, Daewoo); Spain (Repsol); Taiwan (CPC); Tunisia (Setcar); Turkey (TPAO); United Kingdom (Branch Energy, Pacific Resources); Vietnam (Petro-Vietnam). Common sense dictates that had all these countries and corporations been left to 'get on with it', Iraq's oil could have been brought on-stream much earlier than is now likely to be the case. As indicated in the main text, t he United States oil lobby's propa ganda insists that its purpose is to procure adequate energy suppli es at fair prices for the whole of humanit y. The invasion of Iraq in 2003, planned from the outset of the Bush II Administration (on the basis of plannin g in place under the Clinton Administration) resulted in the termination by force majeure of all these operations, from which of course the Unit ed States had been excluded. It is therefore perfectly clear to anyone who is not influenced by US special pleading that one purpose of the invasion was to ensure that Iraq's energy resources were brought under US control, and the negotiating countries excluded, rather than the United States. This exposes the lie that US oil policy is intended to procure affordable energy supplies for the whole of humanity.

And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot sta nd. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end' 2 . Just as Satan cannot cast out his own dem ons - on the contrary, he desires to infest everyone - so does he refuse to evacuate the premises he inhabits unless he is cast out by his nemesis, the power of Jesus Christ, who taught us to say: 'Get thee behind me Satan' 3 .

Following th e pernicious tradition imported by the US Illuminati from Germany (specifically the dumbing-down political control methodology of Wilhelm Wundt, of the University of Leipzig [1875-1920]), the schools are mind-control factories. They deploy the convenient excuse that religious faith is a matter for parents, not for the US school system - which, given the consequent Illu minist Outcome-Based Education curriculum, teaches relativism, that truth is a matter of indivi dual perception and choi ce, and that there is no God, and induces depression and confusion in the minds of children (who are universally referred to as 'kids', as of the goat) in order to ch urn out a lumpen-proletariat that is unable to think for itself, stripped of spiritual nouris hment. Hence sex educat ion, which fosters the lusts of the flesh from an early age, and 'death education', which is designed to impregnate young minds with the only product known to the Illuminised Workers of Darkness: death. In the United Kingdom, children as young as 12 to 14 at schools all over the country were reported in June 2005 to be indulging in 'daisy chain' group sex, with some incidents being captured by the camera s of their mobile telephones, and dissem- inated all round the country and to thei r school friends, and girls as young as 12 years of age being raped after boys had demanded group sex with them, and they had refused 4 . Abominations such as these are the direct consequence of the temporary triumph of the evil, nihilistic regimen of the Illuminati, the transnational Workers of Darkness, who seek to drag the whole of humanity down into the pit with them (to 'keep them company') because they are jealous of all who are not yet depraved, and because they look forward to the time 'soon' when the 'Ancient Mysteries' - the hegemony of pagan sex-magic, ritual and the invocation of demons - will be realised. In the United States, children are taught every minute detail there is to know about the Holocaust, and are requ ired to take part in death-oriented school plays, such as certain plays by the Satanic American pl aywrite, Edgar Allen Poe. Their 'death education' is completed by the universal Satanisation of video games and other elec- tronic playthings, all inventions of the Devil, that focus on sex and death, and which are not only addictive, but have the consequence that the child or teenager is afflicted by oppression, with his or her true underl ying personality smothered by what am ounts to infestation by Evil Spirits, or an oppressi on similar to such infestation. Indeed when an American friend of the Author resolved, with one of his sons, that all the boy's Satanic tapes and other paraphernalia should be destroyed, they found that many items jumped out of the fire, and that a bunch of ravens suddenly appeared circling overhead. The recalcitrant toys of the Devil had to be rep eatedly thrown back into the bonfire, after jumping out several times, far away from the bonfire. The deliberately addictive nature of these abominations further alienates the child from things of beauty - from art, from good music, from poetry, from the beauty of the countryside, from Scripture of course, from romance in human relationships, indeed from all that enhances human life and makes it such a joy to be alive. These are all evils that are directly attributable to the brazen emergence and harsh, stone cold arrogance of Satan, who goes 'to and fro in the earth' and walks 'up and down it' 5 'seeking whom he may devour' 6 . The diabolical, chaotic, Satanic, sexually-oriented 'music' (noise) that is mass-produced for consumption by youth, completes the hell which our generation has created for the young people and children whom once we used to love. To abuse children by filling their minds, souls and environment with dia-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 35 bolical inventions such as these, is nothing less than wanton, flagrant, serial blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Recall that Jesus prescribed a violent end for those who do such things: 'But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea' 7 . It should be noted that this grim warning is repeated twice more in the Gospels - indicative of its singular importance 8 . All those who corrupt children with devilish things face a terrible vengeance: that's a certainty. Another Scriptural reference will place what follows in the necessary context: Psalm 127 begins: 'Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain' 9 . The fundamental problem with the United States (and with Britain, though via a different sequence of historical events), is that the house that replaced the edifice that had been erected by the Figure 11A: The central component of the Yale University crest, taken from a napkin purloined by the Author from the dining room of The Yale Club in New York City. The Latin inscription, 'Lux et Veritas', means, of course, 'Light and Truth'. What do the Hebrew words mean and what are they doing there? The Author can only answer the first part of this question. The Hebrew words are 'Urim' and 'Thummim', oracles from the Old Testament, which learned Rabbis believe represented stones upon which were written 'Yes' and 'No', which were reckoned to indicate the answer to any giv en question raised with God. So, the Yale Crest reads as follows: 'Light and Truth. Yes and No'. In short, the University is double-minded. Figure 11B: The death- badge of another Yale secret society. File and Claw. In a survey of the Yale secret societies, illustrative of the system of synarchy - rule by secret societies - which has the upper hand in the United States, Europe and elsewhere (under the European Commission, there are 3,068+ secret committees about which hardly anything was known until recently) - Harper's Weekly of 7th February 1874 explained: 'An allusion to these societies would not be complete without a reference to their initiations, which are known of and cited throughout the country as illustrations of pandemonium broken loose. Unt il 1869, they were very rough in character, and often resulted in serious injury to some of their victims but since that time, a Professor has been present during the sports, to interfere in case they are taken too far. Tossing in a blanket, rolling in a wheel, stowing away in a coffin, sitting suddenly in a tub of ice, or put under a guill otine, where the knife is arrested within a few inches of the victim's nose, and members ye lling, blowing horns, burning phosphorus, and masked as skeletons and demons' [see Figure 12 on page 36] - these are what a candidate has to pass through before being invested with the dignity of membership'. No wonder the 'values' inculcated in such initiations have infected American society so perniciously. The everlasting pandemonium preval ent in Washington, DC, is entirely consistent with this background."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"36 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale colonists has not been constructed by the Lord, but rather by Lucifer. It is accordingly no surprise that, as has been stated, Washington - a city that was notoriously laid out to an occult blueprint with a gigantic pagan (phallic) obelisk at its centre - is perpetually in a state of turmoil and confusion. There is always some scandal brewing inside the corridors of power and in the bowels of the political establishment. The Author has visited Washington regularly for four decades, and has found that this city is almost always engulfed in contr oversy, bitterness, deception, treachery and shame - reflecting the fact that its god, Lucifer, is in control there. The Author once told the late Fr. Malachi Martin that he always felt most uncom- fortable and oppressed staying in the Washington area for more than 24 hours. 'Oh, you would do', Malachi responded. 'It is a very evil place, and you would sense that. I am not surprised'. And there always seem to be parallel indications of organised vice - most conspicuously nowadays focused on paedophilia, and on the suborning of the foreign diplomatic community inter alia through pr ostitution masterminded by an intelligence community-linked cut-out apparatus located near Dupont Circle.

SENSE OF OPPRESSION REPL ICATED IN NEW HAVEN The sense of oppression evident to many in the Washington area is replicated in a US city considerably further north, the influence on Washington of which has always been pronounced: New Haven, Connecticut, the seat of Yale University. As one analyst wrote in July 1996, Yale is the place 'where three threads of Ameri can social history - espionage, drug smuggling and secret societies - intertwine into one' 12 . The University, originally named Yale College, was established in 1718, after Elihu Yale, Figure 12: A woodcut from 'Fifty Years of Yale News', by the Skull and Bones historian Clarence W. Mendel, published in 'Yale News' on 28th January 1928, New Haven, Connecticut. The illustration makes it crystal clear that the activities of Skull and Bones (and some other Yale-based secret societies) are of an occultic and Satanic nature. It is no surprise that a culture nurtured on devilry is inherently untamed and unruly."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 37 educated in London, who served for many years with the British East India Company and became Governor of Fort Saint George, Madras, India, in 1687, had returned to England in 1699, having amassed a great fortune. Yale's name as a philanthropist having crossed the Atlantic, he responded to many requests from the Collegiate School in Connecticut for donations and learning materials; and an early graduate from the school, Cotton Mather, in due course suggested that the school should, as a consequence, be renamed Yale College. It was among Yale graduates that one of America's first intelligence organisations, known as the 'Culper Ring', was formed. This appears to have been the precedent for Yale University's close relationship, since the foundation of the Republic, with the intelligence community. And since such a sizeable proportion of the population of the DC and Virginia area belongs to that immense community, Washington's close association with Yale is self-evident. The drug-running connection dates from 1824, when Samuel Russell, educated in London, established a firm entitled Russell and Company with a view to procuring opium in Turkey and smuggling it into China, which had the world's largest population of drug addicts. In 1828, the company was combined with a Boston-b ased opium concern, T. H. Perkins, and became the leading American opium smuggling organisation and the dominant American force in China. The Russell family was one of many whose European and American fortunes were acquired from th e 'China' (opium) trade. Kris Millegan has written that 'Russell & Co. was very much a family affair, with uncles, cousins, brothers, fathers and sons dominating the firm and its allied banks and fronts. The Russell family was steeped in Yale College history' 13 . Samuel Russell's cousin, William Huntington Russell, who studied in Germany in 1831-32, formed a senior society, soon to become known as 'The Order of Skull and Bones', after arriving at Yale in 1832, his partner being Alfonso Taft. Russell introduced Figure 13: Two examples of the expens ive real estate owned by Yale secret societies. Left: 'Bones' Hall, the HQ of the Satanic Skull and Bones secret society. Righ t: the HQ of the Scroll and Keys society. The notion of rule by secret societies, or synarchy, is of the esse nce of the conspiracy of the llluminati, who secretly place their operatives in key posts or alongside the holders of power so that only the universalist policies of the llluminati are pursued - as for instance, in the case of the failing European Union."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"38 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale Taft and others to the atheistic social contro l methodology, or 'scientific method', which was flourishing in Germany, especially Prussia, at that time - including a diabolical educational system which has since invaded the US and British educational establish- ments, among those of many other mis guided countries. The proposals included the prospectus advanced by Johan Wolfgang Fitche, which stipulated that children were to be handed over to the State, which would instruct them in what and how to think. Hence such modern aberrations as 'death e ducation' in US and British schools. In an interesting precursor of what happened to the US stock market and the financial system when the Taliban succeeded in virtually neutralising the production of opium in Afghanistan in 2001, a crash in the opium market occurred in 1837, with speculators' losses reverberating internationally - the financial panic being so severe that cash became scarce in both the United States and Great Britain. Likewise, the removal of Afghani opium from the international market under the Taliban caused certain pipelines of drug proceeds to dry up, depressing the US stock market and adding to international economic and financial stresses followi ng the millennium Y2K bug fi asco and the deflating of the dotcom boom in 2000. THE GERMAN CONNECTION CONFIRMED Following a break-in to the meeting hall of the Skull and Bones Senior Society (the notorious Tomb) on 29th September 1876, one of a number of such edifices on the Yale campus [refer, for instance, to Figure 13 on page 37], a document was identified which asserted that 'Skull and Bones is the chapter of a corps in a German university. General Samuel Russell, its founder, was in Germany before his Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of German society. He brought back with him to college, authority to found a chapter here'. The new Yale chapter was modelled upon the German university Verbindung (secret societ y) precedent, establishing what was to become the most conspicuous parallel between German and US society, namely the presence in academic centres of secret societies (synarchy), with which the social classes concerned remain obsessed to this day. The group conducting the break-in called itse lf The Order of File and Claw [see Figure 11B on page 35], operating in appa rent opposition to The Order of Skull and Bones, as the image of a skull with a file and a claw in lieu of the two bones used by Skull and Bones for its symbol, is thought to imply. They discovered an upstairs room, labelled Lodge 322, which they described as 'the sanctum sanctorum of the temple... furnished in red velvef' 14 with a pentagram on the wall. In other words, this and other Yale secret societies are nests of witchcraft. (The only room clad in red velvet that the Author has personal experience of was the dining room of Paul Channon MP, in Belgrave Square, London, in the 1960s). The 'File and Claw' report added that the group had discovered 'pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale, and of members of the Society in Germany, when the chapter was established here in 1832'. The intruders also found an old engraving [Figure 10, on page 33] illustrating an open burial vault 'in which', according to a US expert, 'on a stone slab, rest four human skulls, grouped around a fool's cap and bells, an open book, several mathe- matical instruments, a beggar's scrip, and a royal crown'. On the arched wall in the engraving above the vault are the following German words: 'Wer war der Thor, wer Weiser, wer Bettler oder Kaiser': 'Whether fool, wise man, beggar or Emperor'. Below the vault is displayed this concludi ng sentence: 'Ob Arm, Ob Reich, im Tode gleich':"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 39 'Whether poor or rich, all of us die' - or, in the more cynical tone implied by these inscriptions: 'Poor or rich, all hit the ditch'. The most celebrated of recent researchers into the secrets of Skull and Bones, and its corruption of American society, the late An thony Sutton (whose widow thinks that his death in the early 2000s may not have been natural), explained the occult spiritual meaning and purpose of the focus on human skulls and bones (replicated in many photographs of 'Bonesmen' which have em erged into the public domain over the years), by citing the following penetrating statement by Margaret Elizabeth Stucki: T HE S KULL : M ORTALITY U NMASKED 'The opposite of the mask is the skull. The face of the person is a fleshy skin worn between the two. People who deny the person as made in the image of God directly, and individually created and loved by Him, will seek either of these exits to being truly human: the mask, which covers the mortal man, or the skull which is left after mortal man has departed. Primitive minds who have not yet found God and sophisticates who have rejected Him, desire the mask and the skull' 15 . In other words, the adoption of, and fixation with, human skulls is a deliberately provocative display of The Order's blunt and insistent rejection of the existence of a Figure 14A: The Order of Skull and Bones, of which this is the symbol, was established at Yale in 1832-33 under the pirate (drug-running) flag of William H. Russell, used for hi s family firm's China operati ons. The US fascination with China, which was then the world's largest user and producer of opiates, can be traced to this connection. The skull and crossbones is the symbol of death that is used on bottles of poison: and poisoning is classically the Illuminati's preferred method of 'liquidation'. The symbol is used on pirates' flag s, and was the centrepiece of the Nazi Tofenkopf ('death's head') insignia of the Sc hutzstaffel, or SS. It was used in Prussia by elite soldiers as long ago as 1740. Note that the skull has no lower jaw: the missing mandible signifies the absolute requirement of secrecy. Thanks to Anthony Sutton, Kris Millegan, Andrei Navrozov and others, and to the Internet, the secr ecy imperative or cover of Skull and Bones, and of the llluminati of which this murderously evil se cret society is a central node, has been we ll and truly 'blown'. But although these people may think they have secured the upper hand, their fear of exposure remains intact.

The article explained: 'It is in the mysterious halls of the secret societies that the student finds his dearest pleasures, and from them it is that the powers that direct the college democracy issue'. In other words, Yale College is effectively controlled by its secret witchcr aft societies."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"40 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale God who cares for us and loves us. Those who reject God in this way are, by definition, in the hands of Satan, whose sole product is death (both physical and spiritual). That is why they deal endlessly and exclusively in death - whether raining fragmentation bombs down on civilian populations, massacring unknown hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, committing atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, exporting arrested individuals deemed to be terrorists to countries under the odious US regime of 'extraordinary rendition' so that they can be tortured there with legal impunity for the US officials concerned, bombing the hell out of Belgrade with Luciferian ferocity, manipulating the earth's crust using demonic technology to create earthquakes and tsunamis (the artificially induced tsunami that was generated on 26th December 2004 killed 300,000 people 16 , a hundred times more than the 3,000 who were by official secret design mu rdered on 9/11), or systematically teaching children about death, and flooding the marketplace with Satanic videogames and demon- oriented playthings, thereby corrupting and destroying their childhood. For all these people, the Apostle Paul - the converted Pharisee who was formerly 'breathing out threatenings and slaught er against the disciples of the Lord' 17 , who, as this Scripture confirms, had himself been hyperactively engaged in serially murderous activities against the 'saints' (which means those who believe and profess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God) - has the following explicitly grave warning and condemnation which all Illuminists who have obtained a copy of this book and who have qualms about the course they are following should read again and again with appropriate care and diligence: for it describes their kind perfectly: 'And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge [so that there is no space for God in overcrowded modern life at all, especially in the education system - Ed.], God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fo rnication, wickedness, covetous-ness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covena nt-breakers, without natu ral affection, implacable, unmerciful; Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them' 18 . Paul's warning cannot be sufficiently repeated. This passage succinctly describes, far better than has ever been done by anyone, the cynical mentality, depravity, obtuse stupidity, emotional aridity, arrogant self-satisfaction and self-absorption, coldness and indifference towards others and little children, ruthlessness and exploitativeness, acquisitiveness, and perverse fascination with the occult and with all the Works of Darkness, that the Author has encountered in the course of his several brushes with a certain type of US intelligence officer, while researching this book and other writings. It is not surprising that , at a certain conference several years ago addressed by prominent American opera tives, a well-known British operative was observed to shun the company of the American intelligence contingent and to prefer the company of the odious KGB General Oleg Kalugin, who was also lecturing on that occasion. The point is that the odiousness of Soviet KGB and GRU op eratives is taken for granted and well understood in the West. However some of their US counterparts have raised deception techniques and deviousness to the status of a new art form, wrapping as they do their nefarious practices and intentions in a spurious cloak of legality. For woe betide anyone from 'outside' who 'breaks the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 41 law' in this Devil's kitchen - notwithstanding th at the National Security Act of 1947 et seq. and as amended, authorises US intelligence officials to break the law and can be considered indeed to be a 'crook's charter'. In that passage from Romans, certain phrases are highlighted in bold type, such as 'inventers of evil things', because they are especially relevant in our context: but the entire inspired passage summarises to perfection the essence of the mentality which thinks that it has acquired supremacy over our lives and against which the millions of patriotic Americans and others who seek in whatever manner they can to uphold the truth, are implacably and instinctively opposed. For the deluded Illum-inati cadres believe, as a consequence of their brainwashi ng, that they have the right to order the affairs of the world and to create 'order out of chaos' - cynically aware that, since Lucifer is their master, and the Devil turns everything upside down, what they invariably achieve is the creation of the reverse - chaos out of order. And death. The Order of Skull and Bones is an exclusiv ely Yale-based cult with close historical connections with Germany, and focused exclusively on death. That is its ultimate product, as is the case with all Luciferian organisations. It is, as has been noted and will be seen, 'a multi-generational cult that beli eves in the power of death to bring about change, a group of Zeitgeist initiates believing that the end justifies the means, and using massive deaths to feed their necromancy' 19 . For the heirs of these people, the infliction of 300,000 deaths in Iraq (killing without flinching), and the unfettered use of primitive barbarian torture methods (inflicting pain without flinching) about which the US State Department's self-righteous annual compendium entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices complains vociferously when such atrocities are identified as having been comm itted by other countries, are neither here nor there. The primary characteristic of all these people is that they are double-minded. Double-mindedness is the essence of the Hegelian dialectical methodology, which creates conflict to make 'progress' or advance 'history' - manipulating opposing forces in what to them is an exclusively mechanistic world, the methodology applied also by Nazism and Marxism-Leninism, both of which are driven by the same double-minded Hegelian roots. Hence, for instance, Paul Wolfowitz, a fo rmer US Deputy Secretary of Defense who presided over the furious attack on Iraq, wi ll accordingly have been the perfect candidate to become President of the World Bank, which runs a massive front operation projecting itself as a global welfare agency. Behind the scenes, the World Bank handles intergovernmental payments and manages a parallel financial universe of colossal proportions about which the general public is largely ignorant. Meanwhile Mr Wolfowitz now sits on the opposite side of the dialectic, doling out 'aid' to Third World countries, after having bombed one of them back to the Stone Age. Figure 11A on page 35 shows a crest on a paper napkin purloined by the Author from The Yale Club of New York, which contains within it the Yale University crest. In the circle around the centre are the words: 'Lux et Verita s', Latin for 'Light and Truth'. But in the centre are two Hebrew words, Urim and Thu mmim, which are the oracles used for some centuries by the children of Israel when the Hi gh Priest needed to know God's answer to a specific question: they signify 'Yes' and 'No'. As will be explained on page 42, the Yale crest accordingly advertises the fact that Yale College is a double-minded University of the Illuminati. Its long history of condoning the secret t eaching of occultism, Satanic initiation and the gross abominations in which the College's secret societies specialise, identifies it as a generational source of poison."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale YALE: THE PRIMARY NORTH AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF THE ILLUMINATI An obscure note buried in The Torah: A Modern Commentary 20 , states that the Yale University crest indeed in corporates the two Hebrew words Urim and Thummim. These are believed to have been oracular pieces which were consulted by the High Priest when an answer, ostensibly from God, to a thorny question (such as: 'Should the children of Israel go out to war against the Ph ilistines?') was required. As is typical with Torah commentary, Jewish authorities are unsure of the exact specifications of Urim and Thummim. According to some rabbinical authorities, they were probably stones with Y ES and No engraved on them, which were used like dice. In time, they fell into disuse, as priests and judges able to discern the appropriate answers (or th e will of God) took their place. Josephus, the first century Jewish general, repo rted that Urim and Thummim had not been used for 200 years, but some aut horities think they had ceased to be in use somewhat earlier. During the Babylonian exile [BC 536] they were reinstated briefly by Ezra [Ezra Chapter 2, verse 63] and they were employed also by Nehemiah [Nehemiah, Chapter 7, verse 65] 21 . Thus we discover that Yale's crest conv eys the following deliberately ambivalent message: 'Light and Truth: Yes and No'. Hence, on the one hand, Yale University purports to dispense Light and Truth, while on the other hand, it simultaneously dispenses the reverse thereof, namely: 'Darkness and Lies', the dissemin ation of which is delegated to its secret witchcraft societies. And that it does precisely this is openly displayed, in thinly-disguised form, for the whole world to see upon the University's crest. What this means unequivocally is that Yale University is double-minded: and since, as we have seen, double-mindedness is of the essence of Illuminism, and the University is effectively controlled and subordinate to its own evil secret societies which practice occult abominations and witchcraft-related rituals, it is obvious to anyone with eyes to see that Yale University is North America's pr imary seat of occultic Illuminism in the education sector: the University of th e Illuminati, in thrall to Lucifer. James, the brother of Jesus Christ, writes in his General Epistle: 'A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways'. Just two verses ear lier, he warns that '...he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed' 22 . In part, this means that, at a certain stage in life, we have to make a key decision: whose side are we on, that of Jesus Christ, or Lucifer? Wavering between the two leads to perdition, if the tension is not resolved in favour of God, and lies are pref erred instead. James is elaborating, in his usual succinct manner, upon the Word of Jesus Christ found in Matthew, Chapter 6, verses 19-24: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon eart h, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light' (meaning, that if we are not double-minded, but have made, of our own free will, the decision that is the necessar y prerequisite for the Free Gift of His Grace, and the consequent revelation to us of 'the Way the Truth and the Life' 23 , then the light that is consequently within us will shine forth and our 'whole body shall be full of light' - the opposite characteristic of those who rema in double-minded, and therefore full of darkness). Jesus concluded: 'But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the ligh t that is in thee be darkness, how great is that dark-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 43 ness'. And what is Satan called? He is called Lucifer, 'the light-bearer' 24 - namely, the bearer of false light. This 'illuminates' why Jesus so carefully employed these words: 'If therefore the light that is in thee be dar kness, how great is that darkness!' - by which he meant that if we substitute the false, occult light (= darkness) of Lucifer, as those that this book describes do, then how great is that darkness! How great indeed! It may not be widely known outside the intelligence community that the CIA and its agencies have a philosophical rule or prin ciple, which states that members of the intelligence community alone are entitled to what they call 'the truth' , and that the masses are accordingly not entitled to it. That this is a central component of the indoctrinated CIA mentality has been confirmed to the Author by an attendee at an in telligence conference, who explained that this was in fact one of the first precepts that those attending the conference were taught. Equipped with our observation of the hideous environment of darkness in which these people live and have their being, and within which they plot to destabilise all our lives, we can discern a deeper meaning to th is precept than may seem superficially to apply. The 'truth' that is meant here is the Tight' to which they themselves are addicted, namely the false light of the Tight-bearer, Lucifer'. That Lucifer, the Devil, the god of the Illuminati, turns the truth and everything else upside down, and is the bearer of false light, was of course notoriously confirmed by the occultist, magician, necromancer, Freemason, and serial worker of demonic abominations, Albert Pike, the 'father' of revised US Scottish Rite Freemasonry, in his 'bible' of Masonry, 'Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry': 'Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual , or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!' 25 . Reverting to Scripture [Matthew Chapter 6, verse 24], the Lord concluded: 'No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon'. You cannot be double-minded and expect to get away with it indefinitely. *** Confirmation of the institutionalised repr obate occultism and witchcraft which haunts and controls Yale University is available not just from the evidence that has been amassed by a number of seri ous researchers over the past several decades about The Order of Skull and Bones, which has been gr eatly accelerated with the maturity of the Internet 26 , but also by assembled in formation about many other secret societies of the synarchy. Some have sinister tomb-like structures, called temples, very similar to the 'Bones' tomb on the Yale camp us, such as Book and Snake (Sigma Delta Chi), He Boule, Berzelius, Wolf's Head (founded in 1883), Scroll and Key, and The Order of the File and Claw [see Figure 11B, page 35] (antagonistic to and yet evidently part of Skull and Bones, which is an exact proxy for the standard cooperation-cum-compet-ition modus operandi of the intelligence community). File and Claw is thought to have been a manifestation of a chameleon-like group calling itself 'Bull and Stones'. Phi Beta Kappa, an early secret society, was established at Yale in 1780, func- tioning until 1825. An article in Yale Daily News in 1928 about the secret societies and the snobbish social system with which they have always been associated was accompanied by a woodcut illustrating the Satanic nature of their activities, focused on placing the neophyte in a coffin [Figure 22, page 36] 27 . The erection of these tomb-like tern-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"44 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale ples has served the intended purpose of pr oviding a pretext for the perpetuation of the secret societies themselves, while infecting Yale University with an aura of evil which is integrated with its public 'persona' to such an extent that their notoriety obliterates any 'Lux et Veritas' that the University might lay claim to, domestically and inter- nationally: which is unsurprising since the Univ ersity proclaims and takes pride in the fact that it is double-minded, via its crest. The convoluted history of these and other secret societies at the University of the Illuminati at Yale (including several others using Greek-letter acronyms such as Delta Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, Delta Psi (a.k.a. 'The Tea Company') and Alpha Delta Phi), suggests that at various periods, warfare se ems to have prevailed within the complex campus synarchy, as would be expected in any such Devil's kitchen - one irony here being that synarchy is supposed to be the opposite of anarchy, namely a state of affairs in which everything is controlled by secret organisa tions, whereas under anarchy, everything is out of control: yet geopolitically, synarchy leads to anarchy by the following sequence: the Illuminised intelligence services are in control, and out of control, the overall outcome being the grandfather of geopolitical anarchy. No-one in the United States seems to have the slightest idea how to address this crisis. It is well known that such rivalry has at times extended at Yale to the raiding of a rival secret society's tomb for the purpose of seizing and stealing the ritual artefacts found there. In the first half of the 18th century, secret societi es, notably Cretonia (which lasted just a few years), Livonia (reputed to have lasted for a century) and Brothers in Unity (fate unknown), had emerge d, then faded. The proliferation of secret societies at the University in later years led quickly to intense competition between them to 'tap' the most eligible (and gene alogically acceptable) candidates. What these candidates scramble for is to be selected by the most prestigious of the secret societies, for the privilege of being taught all about occultism, witchcraft and the cult of death. The late Anthony Sutton, who studied Skull and Bones for many years, concluded that the synarchy system of Illuminati control in the United States is organised as shown in this diagram: (1) An Outer Circle, con- sisting of large, open agitprop networks with some membership from Skull and Bones; (2) An Inner Circle, made up of secret societies, including Chapter 322; and (3) An Inner Core, a very secret society within a secret society network, which is the key inner decision-making, steering core. Sutton's diagram is accurate in asserting Inner Circle participation by other secret organisations: among these is Opus Dei. Entities using the term The Order, beginning with the Jesuits, are components, along with many other secret societies. The chief Rex in the United States has been the German-accented operative, Dr Henry Kissinger, 'mentor' of alleged DVD chief, George H. W. Bush (Sr.), who succeeded Nazi Admiral Canaris in 1976-78. Positioning the director of German 'Black' intelligence inside the 'Main Enemy' was clearly a stroke of German Nazi Luciferian genius. ■ Figure 15: A diagram published by the late Skull and Bones expert, Anthony Sutton, explaining how Chapter 322 of The Order relates to some other Illuminati organisations. Sutton's realisation that Skull and Bones is a Chapter (labelled 322) of a vast (German) global conspiracy has n ot been sufficiently appreciated. The present work reveals inter alia th at organisations calling themselves The Order, like Opus Dei, a re ALL Illuminati components."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 45 CAMPUS COMPETITION TO 'ENJOY' A LIFE LEADING TO PERDITION Each of these societies developed its own oc cultic badge, redolent with black symbolism. For instance, He Boule's badge displays an owl, the predatory bird of the night, while that of Eta Phi is a mask. As a certain Rupert Hughes wrote in the obscure Munsey's Magazine, June 1894 [see Figure 14B, page 39], 'the Bones badge consists of a gold skull and crossbones over the number 322, and it is worn on the lower left side of the waistcoat.... there are many interesting customs in vogue among these (competing) secret brotherhoods, such as their habit of returning home from meetings in absolute oblivion of each other and of everybody else, walking at opposite sides of th e pavement and crossing each other's paths on entering their houses.... Most inexplicable to an outsider is the fact that a Yale man is unwilling to breathe a word about his college society, and seemingly feels insulted at any mention of it. Even the most bewitching young woman is warned not to make any remark about his badge (which, by the way, is supposed never to leave his person, even during a bath, when it is carried in his mouth)...'. Recall that the Skull and Bones symbol has no mandible, indicating that members are sworn to secrecy. This is what the intelligence officers meant when they stated, at the conference mentioned earlier, that 'the truth' is theirs exclusively, and is not available to the masses, who, being 'profane', are despised and entitled to be lied to at all times . As has been seen, by the 'truth', they mean th e lies of Lucifer - including the 'secrets' of the Ancient Mysteries of occult paganism and demon invocation which they hold for themselves and which cannot be shared with the 'profane' (the Rest of Humanity). The ritual of 'tapping' new candidates to thes e secret societies (in this case, Skull and Bones, and Wolf's Head) was described by Rupert Hughes in Munsey's Magazine thus: 'The day of election into these societies is perh aps the quaintest feature of Yale life. It is called 'tapping time' or 'slap day', and falls on the third Thursday in May, at five in the afternoon. Then all the anxious Juniors congregate in front of what is now Figure 16: The fixation with rising from the dead, from a to mb, which is a central featur e of the Sku ll and Bones death- oriented witchcraft initiation rit ual. This illustration is extracted from 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry', one of modern Freemasonry's classic works, by the late 33rd Degree Ma son Manly P. Hall [Macoy Publishing and Masonic Supply Company, Inc., Richmond, VA, 1923/1976, front ispiece). It celebrates the grip of the Lion's Paw (handshake) in the 'Pyramid Mysteries'. The priest wore a li on's mask. According to the occultist Manly P Hall: 'By this grip the spirit in man, long buried in the sepulchre of sub stance, is raised to life, and the candi date goes forth as a builder entitled to the wages of an initiate'."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"46 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale used as 'the fence', and pray that they may be chosen' - unaware or oblivious to the fact that if they were to be chosen, they run the risk of their entire life being blighted by the consequences of indulging in occultism. 'Soon , a solemn Senior issues from one of the society halls and threads the crowd until he finds the man he has been delegated to notify. He deals him a vigorous slap on the back, and says sternly: 'Go to your room\". 'Amid wild cheering, the lucky man obeys mutely, followed by his slapper, who says to him: 'Will you accept an election to the society known as Skull and Bones?' and goes back in silence to the hall (i.e. temple, or tomb-like secret society house - Ed.) whence he came, while the happy [i.e . deceived and naively deluded - Ed.] Junior returns to receive the envious congratulations of his friends. About the same time, a Keys man, with a Wolf's Head man in his wa ke, goes through the same evolutions'. 'Between 'tapping time' and initiation, a week elapses. During this, the slapper and the slapped preserve a sacred mutual silence, except on one occasion, when the new man is notified of the time and place of the awful ordeal, which is consummated in the dark recesses of the mysterious chapter house'. This passage makes it clear that activities with homosexual overtones comparable to the esoteric ritual known to be perpetra ted by Skull and Bones upon its neophytes, take place in the temples of the other prominent societies, too. There is evidently competition to be 'tapped' for the most prestig ious secret societies, which are Skull and Bones and Scroll and Keys. Rupert Hughes wrote that 'Keys' 'takes annually the fifteen most convivial and socially pr ominent men left by Bones. [But] Wolf's Head is much less highly rated, and instances are not wholly unknown wherein students unnoticed either by Bones or Keys have yet refused to join Wolf's Head. Its pin is a golden wolf's head transfixed on a loop, and it has a magnificent chapter house'. THE SATANIC-HOMOSEXUAL FOCUS OF THESE HIDEOUS BLACK RITUALS The least celebrated, but by far the most di stinguished, living analyst of The Order of Skull and Bones, is the Author's friend Andrei Navrozoy, whose extraordinary book The Gingerbread Race 28 , published in 1993, followed Antony Sutton's groundbreaking expose by about seven years. While at Yale, Andrei w as the editor of The Yale Literary Review, giving him access to extensive information ab out Skull and Bones, which had been published inter alia decades earlier in the jour nal. Having single-handedly unravelled much of the mystery of The Order, Andrei explains, in the final pages of his book, that he made a concluding attempt to expose George Bush Sr .'s membership of Skull and Bones and its implications for governance, prior to the Ge neral Election on 8th November 1988. In the course of his researches, Andr ei had discovered the Satanic-homosexual nature of the ritual imposed upon 'tapped' members of The Or der, by way of Bones' sordid initiation rites. It is appropriate to get to the point he re by citing The New York Times, so that any suggestion that this Author may have any axe to grind by following what has since become an honourable tradition of exposi ng these extreme evils embedded in the American synarchy system, can have no validity-Several weeks prior to that election, Andrei submitted an article to The New York Times entitled 'Why I am Not Voting'. Just one week prior to the election, the article was accepted and set up in type - too late for the article to have any marked effect on the outcome of Bush vs. Dukkakis. On Monday 7th November 1988, Andrei received a tele phone call from the Editor who asked him whether it was true that (Bonesman) William J. Buckley Jr. belonged to the secret society. 1 confirmed this, whereupon the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 47 Figure 17: ACHIEVEMENTS AND REINFORCED GERMAN CONNECTIONS OF THE PRIMARY MID-19TH CENTURY CONSOLIDATORS OF THE ORDER OF SKULL AND BONES AT YALE The three key mid-19th century figures featured here were responsible for sowing the seeds of the wholesale destabilisation of the traditional morality- based educational system, and ripening it for its contemporary revolutionary purpose*. In his 1986 work 'America's Secret Establishment, the late Antony Sutton explained: ' Our present educational chaos can be traced to three members of The Order: Daniel Coit Gilman (first President of the University of California and First President of Johns Hopkins University), Timothy Dwight (12th President of Yale University) and Andrew Dickson White (first President of Corne ll University). Gilman imported the experimental psychology of the Hegelian physiologist Wilhelm Wundt from Germany. This psychology was grafted onto the American educational system through the educational la boratories at Columbia and Chicago Universities. And they moved... John Dewey [notorious American education engineer - Ed.], a pure Hegelian in philosophy, along the fast track in his career. This has been aptly termed The Leipzig Connection'. For Hegelians, the individual is not important, so the child must be trained to have the attitudes so that he causes no trouble to the state which he is taught to serve, rather than the reverse'. Antony C. Sutton, op. cit, pages 56 et seq. Hence, the evil influence of the Skull and Bones department of t he llluminati has corrupted and reoriented the US educational system for mental-psychological mass manipulation control purposes. The result Outcome-Based Education, also incorporates Soviet methodology. ' So far as education is concerned, the llluminati objective was [is - Ed.] as follows: 'We must win the common people in every corner. This will be obtained chiefly by means of the schools, and by open, hearty behaviour, show, condescension, popularity and toleration for their prejudices which we shall at leisure root out and dispel' '.

Andrei had supplied The New York Times with some of the details of his research. On the very next day, he received at Yale a cu tting from The New York Times, which appears to have used his material, and from which Andrei cited certain passages in his book. The article began as follows: Y ALE S OCIETY RESISTS PEEKS INTO ITS CRYPT Special to The New York Times 'NEW HAVEN - In a sylvan pocket tucked off High Street, masked by blank slits in an ancient stone building called the Tomb, barred from the world by a padlocked iron door, Skull and Bones keeps its secrets closel y. But it casts a shadow across the country'. The article had appeared on the front page of the 'Metropolitan' section of the newspaper on Friday, 4th November 1988, and had been carefully timed so as to preclude the possibility of any further investiga tion immediately ahea d of the scheduled Presidential Election on 8th November 1988. Andr ei had in fact provided the details for this article as early as two years earlier at a lunc h. 'The New York Times had decided to flex its muscle, but not so much as to cause damage to the Bush campaign', he elaborated. The article continued: 'If Bonesmen say anything at all, they portray their association as a venerable fra- ternity whose rituals instil honourable and selfless values in youthful initiates and forge intimate bonds of friendship that last a lifetime. But their cloak of secrecy suggests something considerably more kabbalisric' [sic! This, from the Jewish-dominated New York newspaper]. As Andrei now explained, 'what that 'something' was, the American voter would not be told, although the reporter did mention, thir teen equivocating paragraphs later, that the youthful initiates... '...recount their sexual histories while lying na ked in a coffin. Within the Tomb are the purloined skulls of Pancho Villa and Geronimo, the latter obtained by a raiding party that included the Vice President's father, Prescott S. Bush.... Effort s to get to the truth are met either by silence (Jonathan Bush, the Vice President's brother declined to answer questions on the subject) or by carefully crafted misinformation'. CONFIRMATION OF HOMO SEXUAL-SATANIC ORGIES PUBLISHED IN 2004 In 1977, Ron Rosenbaum, who as an undergraduate at Yale lived next door to the Skull and Bones Tomb, prepared what he t hought was the first outsider's investigation into the secret society, its rituals and its baleful influence on American culture. He asserted in The New York Observer in 2004 that a member of the Yale community had reported that in April 2000, he had managed to audiotape a Skull and Bones initiation ceremony from a previously unexploited perch within the Tomb. In April 2004, an attempt was made, Rosenbaum explained, to videotape a nother such ceremony. The team's equipment included three night-vision-capable digita l video cameras, one tape recorder, a stepladder and two walkie-talkies. As a result, images were obtained of a figure dressed like the Devil, another figure dressed in a hooded-skeleton costume, and other figures clad in black robes. The most significant finding reported by Rosenbaum was a recording of the Skull and Bones 'death mantra', which nonsensically reiterates the following theme, celebrating the Illuminati's sole product - Death: 'The hangman equals death! The devil equals death! Death equals death!'"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 49 Rosenbaum's report in The New York Observer continued: 'Initiates spend [part of] their Senior Year in the basement crypt of the Bones Tomb taking turns lying in a coffin, and, in two long, intense, psycho-drama autobiographical sessions in said coffin, recount their personal sexual history to the other 14 ch osen ones.... The death-centered imagery, the injunction to initiates that they must \"die to the barbarian world\" and be reborn in the Elysian company of the elect of The Order, as they call it, are what makes Skull and Bones radically different from a college fraternity' 29 . Given this endless focus on death, it is hardly surprising that George W. Bush Jr. presided over more executions than any State Governor in the history of the United States: his mind was permanently affected by this culture of death, by this devilish illusion that death is to be exploited in the interests of 'change'. Some Skull and Bones membership books contain pictures of a large number of skulls laid out on a bench, with the word 'Equality' inscribed beneath them, conveying the message that everyone meets death, so that since this is the case, everything is permitted prior to death -including mass executions, fragmentation bombing, and all the other death-oriented atrocities already mentioned. Rosenbaum's report elaborated with a detailed summary of the obscene exclamations and shrieks that the team managed to record, which are frankly too depraved to be repeated here: the reader must refer to the original report in The New York Observer. However it is necessary to relate th e central elements of the ritual which were definitively recorded by the investigation team on 12th April 2004, beginning with the stage of the proceedings when 'a devil figure pulled them ' (the neophytes or initiates) one by one 'into a white tent in the [internal] courtyard where, we th ink, they found their femurs' (human bones which they were each required to select from a pile of bones presumably rifled from desecrated graves or from the bodies of murdered victims from earlier years) 'and emerged with what looked like a thigh bone, although it was impossible to tell whether it once belonged to a human or not'. 'When they re-emerged from the tent, they we re led to the centrepiece of this part of the ritual. They were forced face-to-face with a shocking tableau: a guy holding what seemed like a butcher knife, wearing a kind of animal-skin \"barbarian\" look, stood over what seemed to be a woman covered in fake blood and not much else. The neophyte then approached a skull a few feet away from the knife-wielder-and-victim tableau. The neophyte knelt and kissed the skull, at which point the guy with the knife knelt and cut the throat of the prone figure (we ll, pretended to cut the throat)'. Andrei Navrozov told the Author personally after Ms book had been published that the ritual in the tomb involved one or more unspeakable acts perpetrated upon the initiates, involving a coffin and sexual activity. To this day, Bonesmen at Yale hold what an early observer described as 'strange, occultish' initiation and other rites each Thursday and Sunday in the gloomy Tomb, which was constructed in 1856. Navrozov also explained the curious custom whereby every year, the 15 current Bonesmen were given a task, involving a requirement that an artefact must be brought back to the Tomb on the Yale campus. The mentioned skulls are the most notorious such artefacts. As an example, a given year's task might require the Bonesmen to remove a can- delabra from a prominent building, or to bring in the Archbishop of Canterbury's mitre. The Author has invented these two examples, but they illustrate the kind of task which has to be fulfilled. An observation to be made is that the annual task emphasises one of the characteristics of American society in ge neral, and of Bonesmen in particular: acquisitiveness. The accumulation of materi al wealth is a lifelong preoccupation."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"50 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale A COMPROMISING ADDRESS BY A BONES FOUNDER EXPOSED One of the most prominent of the early ni neteenth century Bonesmen, Daniel Coit Gilman, accompanied by Timothy Dwight and Andrew Dickinson Whit e, went to study philosophy at the University of Berlin. Gilman returned from Europe and incorporated Skull and Bones as the Russell Trust Associa tion in 1856 (in recent years, allegedly to hide irregularities calling into question its charitable tax status, amended to RTA Inc.), with himself as Treasurer and William H. Russel l, the cousin of the drug trafficker, as President; and he spent the next 14 years in New Haven consolidating the power of The Order. In 1858 he was appointed Yale's Librarian. It was Gilman who presented The Order of Skull and Bones with the sini ster engraving of the four skulls - fool, wise man, beggar, emperor - discussed earlier [see Figure 10, page 33]. The picture is accompanied by a card which reads: 'From the German Chapter. Presented by DC Gilman of D. 50'. We will investigate the meanin g of the D shortly. The influence of these three men was enormous. Daniel Gilman became the first President of the University of California, and helped to found, and was the first President of, Johns Hopkins Un iversity in Washington, DC. Gilman was also the first President of the Carnegie Institution, which fu rthers 'One World' strategies, and helped to found three other prominent foundations - the Peabody, Slater and Russell Sage Foundations. His colleague Andrew D. White was the first Pres ident of Cornell University. Millegan reported that he also served as the 'US Minister to Russia, US Ambassador to Berlin and first President of the American Historical Association' (which allegedly regulates historical research and publications ensuring its consistency with, evolving Illuminati strategy). White was also Chairman of the American delegation to the first Hague Conference in 1899, which es tablished an international judiciary'. Bonesman and Gilman 'buddy' Timothy Dwight, a Professor (believe it or not) at Yale Divinity School, was installed as the Presiden t of Yale in 1886. As Milligan confirms, all Yale Presidents since then have either been Bonesmen or else directly tied to the Order of Skull and Bones and its interests. Therefore, this occult Order is integrated into Yale's governing structures and accordingly, as we have seen, effectively controls and influences the University itself, as well as the United States' strategies and the social environment of the country. The trio of Gilman, Dwight and White also influenced other key areas of US and international life, having founded the Amer ican Economic Association, the American Chemical Society and the American Psychologi cal Association. Their influence on the US educational system has been profoundly damaging, leading to the imposition of 'Outcome-Based Education', modelled along Soviet lines, which seeks not to inculcate knowledge, skills and understa nding but to manipulate the mind and psycho-social orientation of young people for control purposes. The influence of the Skull and Bones deat h-oriented manipulative trio on the US educational system is displayed in the panel on page 51 [Figure 18], and the essence of Outcome-Based Education is explained in th e diagram on page 53 [Figure 19]. The German origins of the educational assau lt are examined more fully in Chapter 4. For the 50th anniversary of the foundation of The Order of Skull and Bones in 1883, Timothy Dwight not only reveal ed that Elihu Yale's tomb stone had been stolen and brought to the Tomb, but also described part of the Skull and Bones initiation ceremony. Andrei Navrozov referred to this documen t amusingly, citing 'the manuscript of Timothy Dwight's fiftieth anniversary history of the society, a copy of which I am at present the sole uninitiated possessor' 30 , and from which he reproduced this passage,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 51 Figure 18 [See also Chapter 4]: THE INFLUENCE OF WILHELM WUNDT ON AMERICAN EDUCATION NOTE: The synarchy (rule by secret societies) system is buttressed by the operations of numerous tax-exempt foundations established by members of The Order, which finance projects in furtherance of the secret objectives of the llluminati, of which Skull and Bones is a coercive component."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"52 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale in which Dwight revealed the secret Sa tanic gobbledegook imprecation used by the Bones initiates, and the sexual content of initiation: 'But the initiation itself is not changed. The same gelatinous mess is made of the barbarian stranger in every case, by the same process and by the same solemn rites' [The reader will not be assisted by this Author in interpreting the preceding sentence, which provides 'horse's mouth' confirmati on of the perverse sexual content of the 'process and solemn rites', which are 'the sam e' for every initiate: in other words, there is not a single Skull and Bones initi ate who has escaped this Satanic ritual involving masturbating with his peers]. 'The new candidate is recreated; ceases to be a Him; finds a new spirit within him, which casts out the old [sic confirmation fo r True Christians, and for anyone with common sense, that the rites have the intended effect of infesting or investing the initiate with demons, or causing him to suffer demonic infestation or possession with evil spirits, which of course take hold and drive his behaviour unless he repents, for the rest of his life]; knows more of Demosthenes [see below] in a few moments [i.e., though the resulting infestation or possession by evil spirits] than his teachers had ever taught him, and, as he gains for himself the accurate meaning a nd pronunciation of the word 'Toby-fkliwizi- firo-catlicko-carricks-carnicksi-carnickso-macpherson-o'phane', begins to understand and to speak the sacred language. And so we all become some of the Skull and Crossbones, to whom all others are but contemptible foemen'. CRASH COURSE TO INFEST IGNORANT YOUNG MEN WITH DEMONS From this passage, and the preceding informa tion, contained in an address by one of the early patriarchs of The Order of Skull and Bones, who was then the President of Yale College, no less, the following horrendous intelligence emerges: 1. The initiation rituals are de signed to be of such demonic intensity that evil spirits are duly invoked, as intended, with the express purpo se that the neophyte being initiated is to be infested and/or possessed by them. In occultism and magic, infestation or possession by evil spirits can occur only when the participant, of his own free will, invites Evil Spirit (which, as is manifested in the New Testament is/are both singular and plural simultaneously) to enter him or her. This is an undisputed fact with which all experts, and sound exorcists, agree. (Likewis e, in spiritual healing the sick person must, of his or her own free will, believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and has power over all things and the desire to heal the person: otherwise, prayers for spiritual rest oration to health may not be heeded). The Satanic initiation rites of The Order of Skull and Bones are clearly crafted so as not to compromise the free wi ll of the initiate, while at the same term subjecting him in practice to oppressive 'peer pressure' that by now he proves unable to resist. Such instrumental interference with and exploitation of the innocence of young people represents a grievous blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The temple of the Holy Spirit is the human person 31 . 2.1. The initiate attends Skull and Bones rituals every Thursday and Sunday during his Senior Year. The first point to make here is that this means his energies and attention are being seriously hijacked and diverted fr om his studies and from the source of enlightenment that he should in fact be pa ying attention to, on the assumption that he wishes to progress spiritually, namely Script ure. If he, instead of wasting his time with these reprobate occult rituals and activities, were to devote just half an hour a day to reading Scripture, he would quickly understand that in caving in to The"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 53 Order's peer pressure tactics, he is being diverted by evil forces from the Way, the Truth and the Life of Jesus Christ. We have to place this consideration first, since this is the essence of the mistake he is making. Instead of which the initiate, being blind, is being led to perdition by the blind, or by those who have been blinded by Satan and who have perversely mistaken the false Tight' he offers for the real thing. 'And no marvel: for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light' (= Lucifer) 32 . 2.2. WHY must the initiate attend Skull and Bones rituals every Thursday and Sunday during his Senior Year? The answer to this qu estion 'illuminates' the extreme gravity of the Curse of Yale. What is going on during these rituals? More than enough is known about their content to make it crystal clear to all s ober analysts that regular attendance at these Satanic rituals has the following single purpose: to procure specifically that the neophytes/initiates are indeed infested and taken over or possessed by demons (evil spirits). In other words, what is happening is that the initiates undergo a systematic series of witchcraft rituals designed to impregnate evil spirits into high-flying young persons who, unless their wills resist throughout the initiation rites - or their wills are robust enough to give them the strength to refuse to participate and to escape, which has never been heard of - are intended to emerge from Yale infested or possessed by evil spirits, so that they are accordingly equipped for the Lu ciferian work they will be required to undertake (for massive material rewards, of course) all through their lives on behalf of the Illuminati. We can see clearly that the foregoing is true no t least by comparing the intense course of rituals provided by The Order at Yale with the 'more leisurely' diversionary 'service' rendered to Masonic candidates and adepts as they progress through successive Scottish Rite or Grand Orient Degrees towards infestati on by evil spirits and the worship of Lucifer. Those processes usually take many years, unless a key figure (such as the current Shah of Persia in exile) is considered to be of such prospective value to the Luciferian elite that he is initiated into, say, the 33rd Degree, having jumped or omitted a large number of 'lesser' degrees. By contrast, the The Order of Skull and Bones at Yale provides an intensive crash course which is intended to procure that, within the space of just the initiate's Senior Year or less, the selected initiates are infested or possessed by demons when they leave Yale. This ensures that, once deposited back into 'real life', no time is wasted by these 'chosen ones', who are accordingly equipped and fully qualified to proceed with the Luciferian tasks that the niuminati will in due course allot to them. Figure 19: Outcome-Based Education, imposed in the United States, is derived from the subversive educational philosophy of Wilhelm Wundt [see Figure 18] and from the Soviet blueprint. Its purpose is to brainwash y oung people so that their minds ar e controlled and they can be the more easily manipulated."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"54 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale 3. The neophyte/initiate 'begins to understand and to speak the sacred language'. In June 2003, the Author received a weird telephone call from an individual (later clearly identifiable as a CIA operative), calling from Dublin (a hotbed of CIA activity) who, after alleging family ties with the Author, star ted to discuss Scripture. (Since the National Security Agency, GCHQ and other snooping organisations listen in to the Author's telephone calls, this sudden feigned interest, out of the blue, in the Author's scriptural studies, was clearly a consequence of such routine eavesdropping). During the first half hour, the statements uttered by this cold calle r were scripturally correct. However as the conversation progressed, the call er introduced certain abominable aberrations, such as the diversionary lie that Eve had sex with the serpent - from which this ogre concluded that the descendants of that union were the Black and Brown r aces, while the descendants of the union between Adam and Eve were the White and Yellow races (the old Nazi eugenics garbage). The Author has possession of the name and the Dublin and San Diego addresses of this individual. After ordering a large number of publications, shouting 'I don't mind how much it costs, do you hear me? Send me everything you publish' and providing 'his' (CIA) Credit Card details, the caller then proceeded with the following question: 'Can you speak in tongues?' Upon the Author saying that he could not, the caller emitted a loud demonstration of incomprehensibly hideous convoluted verbal non-stop gobbledegook. The Author quickly realised that this represented a demonstration of an infestation which the caller could evidently 'turn on and off' at will, and which he purported to believe was the work of the Holy Spirit - wh ereas of course in reality it represented a manifestation of trickery by one or more ma nifestations of Evil Spirit, and therefore represented another blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (for which no forgiveness is available). When the Apostles were visited at Pentecost by the Holy Spirit, they spoke in foreign tongues and made perfect sens e to those foreigners who were present 33 , whereas the harsh demoniac noise coming dow n the phone line from this deluded CIA operative was chaotic, confused, and meaningless. After two further unsolicited demonstrations of this dreadful stream of confused drivel, which the CIA caller started and stopped, like turning the bathwa ter on and off, and which he continued to misrepresent as a manifestation of the Holy Spirit's gift of 'speaking in tongues', the Author made it plain to the caller that he was in error, and finally managed to terminate the unsolicited 'conversation' 34 . But in the light of the passage from Ti mothy Dwight's 50th anniversary address to assembled Bonesmen, placed in the public domain by Andrei Navrozov, it is crystal clear to the Author that this verbal garbage was illustrative of or comparable to, and from the same source as, the 'sacred language' of Skull and Bones witchcraft, such as: 'Toby- fkliwizi-firo-catlicko-carricks-carnicksi-carnickso-macpherson-o'phane'. In other words, fake 'speaking in tongues' is one of the manifestations of demonic infestation or possession which is or can be conferred through the Satanic initiation rites to which those Senior Year Yale undergraduates who are 'lucky' enough to be 'slapped' and 'tapped', foolishly and ignorantly aspire. Self-evidently, those who are not 'tapped' suffer disappointment at their exclusion from the advertised guaranteed route to wealth and power at the time, but are saved from the extreme dangers inherent in any dabbling with the occult. This is a particularly evil form of 'dabbling' as the neophyte is made to 'desire' the 'privilege' of initiation, which turns out to be a trap liable to enslave him for the rest of his life, turning him into a servant of Lucifer 35 ."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 55 Figure 20: 'IN YOUR FACE' DISPLAYS OF THE ILLUMINATI'S OCCULT KABBALISTIC NUMBER 322: SEE ALSO PAGES 72 & 738 The Area Code for Brussels is 322. As a defector from the sect of the llluminati explains in Chapter 7, Belgium has traditionally been the financial centre of the llluminati. Therefore, when dialling a Brussels telephone number, one is dialling into the seat of the New Underworld Order, the engine of the globalist revolutionary assault on nation states. The European Union Collective exists to subsume and displace its constituent nation states, as befits such a Leninist supranational organisation which operates collectively and superfluously duplicates government structures, after the Leninist control model. Lenin was an implementer for the llluminati. Nation states stand in the way of llluminati hegemony. For many years, the World Council of Churches, a revolutionary body with secular objectives masquerading as a Christ ian organisation, had prec isely 322 member churches. The Second Iraq War was carefully planned to begin on 22nd March 2003 (322), but was triggered 48 hours earlier ostensibly, according to the 'line' retailed in late April 2003, because the CIA had been in close contact with a 'guy on the ground' in Baghdad before the war about Saddam Hussein's movements, prompting the United States to attack one of the dictator's compounds earlier than planned. An agonised meeting took place in the Oval Office, la sting for four hours, as President Bush and his colleagues wrestled with the problem of whether or not it would be 'bad luck' not to start the war on the kabbalistically opportune date of 322. It proved, as subsequent events have shown, to be 'bad luck' indeed. On 12th November 2001, DynCorp, an intelligence community and US Government data processing, military operations and intelligence work contractor , was awarded a contract worth precisely $322 million to produce and store vaccines for the US Department of Defense. DynCorp, with Hadron, both of which are US intelligence-linked defence contractors, are involved in ter alia in classified research programmes on communicable diseases. Around New Year 2004, British Airways Flight 223 (which is 322 backwards) en route to Washington, DC was repeatedly delayed while US Homeland Security officials investigated every passenger against a data base, establishing that there were no terrorists on board on any of the flights concerned. 322 people were reported slaughtered in the Beslan atrocity. The US-sourced computer program used by the Au thor to make up this book has a mechanism enabling blank pages to be mass-produced forward. The Author made use of this fac ility and, without specifying how many extra blank pages were needed, was surprised to discover that the page expansion mechanism had stopped on page - guess what? - 322. Another British researcher who has been preparing manuscripts exposing Skull and Bones and Masonic occultism has, on several occasions, found that the number 322 has suddenly appeared on his screen, for no rational reason (Evil Spirit is not rational). The Order of Skull and Bones is known as The Brotherhood of Death, and as Chapter 322 of a German secret society which, given the virtual ident ity of Skull and Bones initiation rituals with those of the llluminati sect, and the precis e coincidence of their objectives and modi operandi, is certainly the llluminati. Given that 'Bon es' adepts are branded in the small of the back with a 'D' for Demosthenes [see main text], who committed suicide in BC 322, the date of this legendary Greek character's death is also pertinent - as is the fact that it is in Mark Chapter 3, verse 22, that we read: 'And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem said \"He hath Beelzebub, and by the Prince of the Devils doth he cast out devils'\". This discovery prompted the Author to look up other combinations of 3 and 22 in the Gospels (on the basis that these people, not the Author, attach occultic, kabbalistic, magical, Luciferian, superstitious significance to such numerology; and what do we find? Why, that Luke, Chapter 22, verse 3, is the place where Luke writes: 'Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve'. It was Satan himself, not one or more of his demons, who entered into Judas Iscariot: in Chapt er 22, 3 (322 reversed). Given that The Order is The Brotherhood of Death - Satan's product - this verse makes everything plain. For the ri gorous schedule of Skull and Bones rituals and its Senior Year indoctrination represents a crash course in demonic infestation or possession. ■"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"56 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale THE 'GREAT AND THE GOOD' = OF TEN THE VERY BAD AND THE LOST Prominent initiates of Skull and Bones down the decades who, in varying degrees, have imposed, sustained or in no way impeded the deadeningly reprobate hegemony of, their Satanic 'death culture' upon US strategy, society and thus upon the international community, have been identified in recent y ears by other researchers from The Order's own documentation - some of which has beco me available after initiates have 'seen the light' (i.e., repented), and after break-ins to the Tomb on the Yale campus.

Many Bonesmen have been US Ambassadors to China, the source and top consumer of opiates in the 19th century, si nce President Nixon re-established a direct US political and economic relationship with the Chinese Communists. SKULL AND BONES AND THE GLOBAL DRUG TRADE Details of the traditional connections between between Yale, Skull and Bones and the global drug trade have also been delineated by researchers. In 1903, the Yale Divinity School established a network of schools and hospitals in China, with Mao Tse-Tung among their staff. Mao, that former employee of the Yale organisation in China, who had been involved in narcotics operations during the 1930s and 1940s, used drugs against Chinese populations before reorganising China's drug-related intelligence activ ities to focus on external operations after the Communists had seized power in 1949. The presence of Mao Tse-Tung among the personnel at a Yale-organised establishment in China provides evidence of US intelligence intermeddling in Chinese affairs in connection with the spread of Communism to China. It a ppears that - as in the subse quent well-known instances of Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, and General Manuel Noriega - US intelligence's intrigues in China during the prewar and World War II years, exploiting Yale's 'China resources', were associated with an operation in which Mao Tse-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"58 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale Tung may have been double-crossed - a familiar ploy of US intelligence, based upon the crude operational 'bait and switch' tactic. In the 1970s, George Bush Sr. was allegedly despatched to 'look after' the China trade or iginally developed by Messrs Russell and Company, which was among the first, along with European opium trading houses, to trade out of Shanghai when the port was first opened to foreigners in 1843. As Kris Millegan has written, 'the Bush family is still very much involved in the economic activ ities of \"Red\" China. Many researchers contend that George Bush Sr. has been with the CIA since the early 1950s, and that one of his jobs was to consolidate and co-ordinate the worldwide narcotics industry, the largest industry on earth'. It is, as will be revealed in Chapter 7, the industry most extensively exploited by the Illuminati to finance The New Underworld Orde r, fronted secretly by Germany. What has not hitherto been understood is that George Bush Sr. allegedly took over from Admiral Canaris, the veteran German spymaster, as the head of Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD), the German 'Black' intelligence agency and controller of German global strategy (covered by the STASI, the Illuminati dimension and the Cold War), in the late 1970s, after he ceased to be Director of Central Intellig ence (DCI) and ahead of his becoming US Vice President. This was possible not least because George Bush (Busche) Sr. may hold German nationality (which can be based on ethni city) as well as his US nationality. It is no accident that the activities of the gl obal energy corporations and of intelligence linked drug-trafficking organisers, appear in many contexts to coincide. For instance, Richard L. Armitage, a veteran operative who serv ed as Deputy Secretary of State under Colin Powell during the first Bush Jr. Administration, refused Condoleeza Rice's invitation to remain with the State Department, re portedly using colourful language to make his point, and indicating that he would be leaving the Govern ment to establish an 'export-import agency' in Kabul, where, prior to the US invasion, the Taliban had all but eradicated drug-cultivation and trafficking operations. Following the post-9/11 US invasion of Afghanistan, drug cultivation soared to the highest levels ever recorded. The Vietnam 'Police Action' was likewise almost certainly connected to the lust of criminalis ed US intelligence, serving not the interests of the American people but rather those of the Illuminati, and behind them Germany, to acquire hegemony in the 'Golden Triangle'. Large numbers of bodybags were returned from Vietnam stuffed not with human bodies, but with heroin. Prior to the Vietnam 'War', the Golden Triangle focused upon Burma was operated by Corsican mobsters and French intelligence operatives. When the United States replaced the French, penetrated US intellig ence, assisted by Sicilian mafia cadres, took over 38 . Under President Reagan, the highest US Government official involved in the so- called 'war on drugs' was then the most prominent of all 'Bonesmen' - the then Vice President George Bush Sr., who chaired Reag an's Cabinet working group on drugs and was Director of the National Narcotics Interdiction Sy stem which, like all subsequent US official 'anti-drug' structures, performed the function of providing the chief drug-runners with a convenient means of maintaining an accurate overview of the global drug economy, and of eliminating or controlling the opposition. Frances Mullen Jr., a former chief of the ineffective Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), which carries out token 'anti-drug busts' in order to remind the American people that the Government is 'doing something' about the drugs scourge, described Mr Bush Sr.'s purported antidrug activities as 'an intellectual fraud' and 'a liability rather than an asset'. This was of course code for his knowledge that George Bush Sr. is allegedly the biggest global drug-trafficking crook of them all, in line with his DVD status. Further specific details of"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 59 US covert intelligence drug-trafficking policy for the Illuminati, follow in Chapter 3. As Kris Millegan reports, 'soon after these statements, Mullen resigned and the resultant General Accounting Office (GAO) report was buried' 39 . The GAO document stated that there were 'no benefits from the US National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, directed by George Bush. In fact, the overall effect was to encourage supply'. This is just one of a long series of incidents and documents exposing the reality that the corrupted US Government intelligence structures are in the hands of, integrated with and in many respects indistinguishable from, organised criminal interests - as a direct consequence of which the self-financing, stand-alone US intelligence community has effectively hijacked, and covertly controls, the US Government itself. Since the CIA, with its myriad 'subordinate' agencies , is hugely criminalised and may accurately be described, like the KGB, as a 'state within the state 'and a criminal organisation, and since an International Monetary Fund official is on record as having stated that 'we cannot fix the global drug problem because if the drug probl em were to be solved, the international financial system would collapse' 40 , the United States is the checkmated victim of a truly millennial crisis which is destabilising the whole world. In March 2005, a senior US intelligence officer told this Author that 'no-one' (in Washington) 'can move'. He refused to elabor ate, since he was referring to the blackmail nexus which is throttling governance. In conver sations with other US operatives in the spring of 2005, the Author was advised that the overall situation could be described as one of 'check' but not of 'check-mate'. Succe ssive Presidencies have been penetrated and controlled by German 'Black' intelligence (DVD), based in Dachau -the key exception being John R Kennedy, who was assassinated on German (DVD) instructions precisely because he was not a DVD asset. In addition to George Bush Jr .'s father, reliably alleged to be the actual head of the DVD, the retention of George Tenet, a Clinton appointee and an alleged German/French intelligence asset, as Director of Central Intelligence, was the coup that most fatally compromised the Administration of George Bush Jr., from the outset. The US intelligence community's control ov er the media, which has culminated, as noted earlier, with the installation of an in telligence cell in every press room, is nothing new. In the late 1980s, Monika Jensen-Ste venson, a staff producer with the 60 Minutes programme at CBS, left her job after CBS had refused to air her findings on the United States' involvement in drug-trafficking. In 1991, she published Kiss the Boys Goodbye 41 , which explains inter alia just how the US intelligence community perverted the official Prisoner-of-War/Missing-in-Action (POW/MIA) structures, and used them to cover the trafficking of drugs from the Golden Triangle region. Likewise the criminalised US intelligence community (or elements of it) have routinely leverage d the taxpayer-funded anti- drug structures (such as the Drug Enforcement Agency) as cover for drug-running operations, and to facilitate the seizure of co ntrol over and elimination of competition. The Government indulges in cosmetic operations to appease public opinion. • The so-called 'War on Terrorism' has a coefficient - called the 'War on Drugs'. In addition to fronting the US National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, Vice President Bush fronted a Task Force on Combating Terrorism, under President Reagan, as a result of which counter-terrorism tactics, the politics of the dr ug wars between criminal gangs and between criminalised elements of national intellige nce communities, became interchangeable and indistinguishable. As Russell S. Bowen once pointed out, 'the war against terrorism and the war on drugs have similar modi operandi in [respect of]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"60 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale their disdain for the [US] Constitution. Only one career Government man has the distinction of simultaneously overseeing both these \"wars\", George Bush'. Mr Bowen might have added that drug-trafficking is terrorism. In the case of General Manuel Noriega, formerly a drug-trafficking 'partner' of the United States, his greed pl aced him in direct conf lict with covert US dr ug-running interests, so he was 'taken out' - enabling US business to be resumed 'as normal'; and the Afghani Taliban were overthrown after their suppression and usurpation of local opium poppy cul- tivation interfered with cash flows into the US financial system, with destabilising financial and economic consequences. Within one year of the US invasion of Afghanistan, opium poppy production now 'protected' by the US military, had risen to historically unprecedented levels - while sporadic anecdotal information received in the summer of 2005 indicated that rehabilitation of the country remained largely a pipedream. No wonder that the sinister Richard L. Armitage was in such a hurry to get back into the 'business', setting up his 'export-imporf agency in Kabul. He is alleged to have exclaimed, while hidebound by his State Department position: 'We gotta get back into business'. ROSS PEROT FIRED ONCE BUSH SR. KNEW WHERE HE WAS COMING FROM After President Ronald Reagan had appointed Ross Perot, the Texas billionnaire, to the President's Advisory Council on Foreign Intellige nce, the late President added to Perof s responsibilities by making Perot a special Presidential investigator, charged inter alia with researching the fate of the United States' Prisoners of War (POWs) and troops Missing in Action (MIA) from the Vietnam War. Taking his new responsibilities very seriously, Mr Perot, equipped with special clearance and access to documents and sources, spent a considerable amount of time and money (presumably his own, as the American Government typically takes advantage of others' private wealth) looking for answers to questions which have distressed thousands of suffering, bereaved American s for decades. Monika Jensen-Stevenson reported on Ross Perot's activities as follows, in 'Kiss the Boys Goodbye': ILLUMINATI TARGET THE TOP UNIVERSITIES Universities were originally founded as centres inter alia of religious instruction. For instance, the Author's magnificent Oxford College is named Christ Church. But while he was an undergraduate there, he noticed little of the presence of Jesus Christ: in fact the ancient Cathedral is spiritually cold, depressing and 'dead'. The reason for this becomes ev ident if one enters the right-hand ante-chapel area and turns with one's back to the small altar, looking upwards. There, displayed well above eye level, are certain Masonic inscriptions. In other words, this College-based Cathedral, like the College itself, and so much else at Oxford, is double-minded. Antony Sutton has the following interesting observation on page 80 of his work 'Inside America's Secret Establishment: An introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones' [op. cit.]: 'The llluminati was founded at the University of Ingolstadt. The Group (a German-linked llluminati Establishment source) was founded at All Soul's College, Oxford, and The Order [of Skull and Bones] was founded at Yale University in the United States'. Although we might quarrel with the assertion t hat the llluminati were actually founded by Adam Weishaupt at Ingolstadt (a substantial body of research suggests a far longer historical pedigree), that is not pertinent: the lllumi nati were consolidat ed at Ingolstadt. But Antony Sutton then draws attention to the following irony: 'The paradox is that institutions supposedly devoted to the search for trut h and freedom have given birth to institutions devoted to world enslavement' - by 'Brothers' of the llluminati conspiracy. Chapter 8 reveals that The Apostles at Cambridge were an Abwehr recruiting pool. ■"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 61 'Relations between Bush and Perot had gone downhill ever since the Vice President had asked Ross Perot how his POW/MIA investigations were going'. '\"Well, George, I go in looking for prisoners\", said Perot, \"but I spend all my time discovering [that] the Government has been moving drugs around the world and is involved in illegal arms deals.... I can't get at the prisoners because of the corruption am ong our own people\"'. Whether Perot knew that he was speaking directly to the alleged primary source of that corruption, was not related. 'This ended Perot's official access to the highly classified files as a one-man pres- idential investigator. \"I have been instructed to cease and de sist\", he had informed the families of missing men early in 1987'. This contretemps was described slightly diffe rently by Russell S. Bowen in 1991: 'As Cold War adventurism was given primacy in American foreign policy over the goals of the war on drugs, covert action and the secrets of the CIA's continuing wars in Southeast Asia were considered more important than efforts to release POWs. The POW issue has never been popular with American liberals' [= socialists - Ed.] 'who otherwise rush to question the CIA, because it was an issue which became a cause of the American righf (and also because of the implications for soci alism of any detailed exposures of Soviet criminality towards Prisoners of War and missing US soldiers). 'One of the loudest critics of Government cover-ups of POW information is Senator Jesse Helms. Ronald Reagan embraced the cau se of appointing Texas billionaire Ross Perot to investigate the fate of Vietnam MIAs. But Mr Perot took the assignment more seriously than the Reagan-Bush Administration [had] apparently intended'. Here again, it would appear that the main intention of appointing Perot had been to divert the abused American public with a char ade, conveying the impression that 'something was being done' to solve the 'riddle' of the missing POW /MIAs. 'When he got hard evidence of at least some POWs [being] still alive in Southeast Asia and found his search for them blocked by American intelligence officials involved SIMILARITY OF ILLUMINATI INITIATION TO THE INITIATION RITUAL RITES OF SKULL AND BONES The classic expose of the sect of the llluminati, 'Proofs of a Conspira cy', by John Robison, originally published in 1798 [see Chapter 7] contains a description of part of the initiation ceremony or ritual for the degree of Regent (there are only two llluminati degrees that are higher, according to Robison, Magus and Rex), which reveals similarities with the death-oriented initiation ritual of The Order of Skull and Bones, a.k.a. The Brotherhood of Death, a.k.a. The Order: The candidate is presented for reception in the character of a slave; and it is demanded of him what has brought him into this most miserable of al l conditions. He answers: Society - the State - Submissiveness - False Religion. A sk eleton is pointed out to him, at the feet of which are laid a Crown and a Sword. He is asked whether it is the skeleton of a King, a Nobleman, or a Beggar? As he cannot decide, the President of the meeting says to him, 'the character of being a Man is the only one that is of importance'. As with Skull and Bones, the essence of the point is that we are all mortal, so we are all equal (in death), which by extension implies that all power is illegitimate or to be challenged (the unspoken exception being the intended collective power of the llluminati). The Regent ritual stresses the 'line' that power in t he hands of 'our rulers' is 'not so secure as in the hands of our Members whom we train up with so much care, and place about Princes' and that the llluminati are uniquely and exclusively qualified to rule. ■"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"61 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale in drug trafficking, Perot complained to Vice-President Bush. As soon as Mr Bush realized where Perot was coming from, Pero t was dropped like a hot stone by the Administration' 42 . This story, incidentally, illustrates a tell-tale phenomenon that we have identified among members of the intelligence community: they are constantly blowing their cover. They blow their cover whenever one of their multiple lies unravels before our noses, as happens all the time; whenever a high security classified telephone rings accidentally in an office by mistake; whenever an eavesdropping chip is found in a target's jacket; whenever a political activist who has single-handedly exposed the fraudulence of a General Election is poisoned; whenever heavy breathing and pointed electronic interruptions and noise take place during telephone calls; whenever an undertaking is breached; whenever one of them who has thr eatened a colleague (as they do all the time) demands to know whom he is alleged to have threatened and whether the person asking the question is possessed; and whenever all kinds of other reprobate behaviour rarely encountered in normal life, is observed. In this instance, Vice President Bush Sr. reconfirmed, if any confirmation was ever necessary the involvement of US intelligence and the Government at the very highest level in drug-running, at the expense of American prisoners of War and Mi ssing in Action, and with stone cold-hearted indifference to the plight and suffering of the bereaved. Addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine cannot be manufactured for distribution without the necessary precursor chemical s. Therefore, establishing which pharm aceutical companies manufacture these chemicals prov ides leads to the Octopus-like network of organised criminality which hides within and at the highest levels of the official structures. Among the largest manufacturers of the precursor chemicals used for cocaine and heroin is Eli Lilly Company of Indianapolis, one of the most occult of all American cities. This is the home capital of the Quayle family which is a shareholder in the firm, on the board of which George Bush Sr. has served. Eli Lilly is also the corporation which was the first, evidently, to synthesise LSD for the US intelligence community. A number of Bush family members have held shares in Eli Lilly. In 'George Bush: The Unauthorised Biography', by Webster Griffin Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, which traces in great detail the convoluted activities and relationships of George Bush Sr., reference is made in Chapter Four to the H. Smith Richardson Foundation [see page 56], which became 'a Bush family-dictated private slush fund which was to be utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency, and by Vice-Presid ent Bush, for the conduct [actually, just one of the conduits - Ed.] of the Iran-Contra adventures...'. 'The Bush family knew Richardson and his wi fe through their mutual friendship with Sears Roebuck's Chairman, General Robert E. Wood. General Wood had been President of the America First organization, which had lobbied against war with Hitler's Germany. H. Smith Richardson had contributed the start-up money for America First and had spoken out against the United States \"joining the Communists\" in fighting Hitler. Richardson's wife was a proud relative of Nancy Langehorne from Vi rginia, who married Lord Astor and backed the Nazis from their Cliveden Estate.... The H. Smith Richardson Foundation was organized by Eugene Stetson, Jr.., Richards on's son-in-law. Stetson (Skull and Bones, 1934) had worked for Prescott Bush as Assistant Manager of the New York branch of Brown Brothers Harriman'. [This is how these Octopus-related narrativ es, which drop names everywhere with tedious regularity, proceed. One must be patient]. 'In the late 1950s, the H. Smith Richards on Foundation took part in the \"psycho-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 63 logical warfare\" of the CIA. This was not a foreign, but a domestic, covert operation, carried out mainly against unwitting US c itizens. CIA Director Allen Dulles and his British allies organized MK-ULTRA, the testing of psychotropic drugs including LSD on a very large scale, allegedly to evaluate 'chemical warfare' possibilities. In this period, the Richardson Foundation helped finance experiments at Bridgewater Hospital in Massachusetts, the center of some of th e most brutal MK-ULTRA tortures'. As has been summarised [page 62], Eli Lilly Co. synthesised LSD for the Central Intelligence Agency's brutal MK-ULTRA offensive, which at a later stage was allegedly controlled by Richard Cheney, George Bush Jr.'s Vice President. Russell S. Bowen reports that 'after leaving the CIA [sic: this is of course inaccurate] in 1977, George Bush was made a Director of the Eli Lilly pharm aceutical company by none other than Dan Quayle's father and family, who owned the controlling interest in the Lilly company and the Indianapolis Star. Dan Quayle subsequently allegedly acted as a go-between for drug kingpins, gun runners and US Government officials' implicated in what is formally known as the Iran-Contra scandals (although this phrase has since acquired the broader meaning of referencing the entire hornets' nest of related scandals). 'The entire Bush family were large stockholders in Lilly, Abbott, Bristol, Pfizer, etc. Af ter Bush's disclosure of assets in 1979, it became public [knowledge] that Bush's family still had a large interest in Pfizer and substantial stock in the drug companies. In fact, Bush actively lobbied illegally both within and without the Administration as Vice President in 1981, to permit drug companies to dump more unwanted, obsolete or especially domestically-banned substances on Third World countries'. 'While Vice President, Bush continued to act illegally on behalf of pharmaceutical companies by going to the IRS [Internal Re venue Service] for special tax breaks for certain drug companies manufactur ing in Puerto Rico. In 1981, Bush was ordered to stop lobbying on behalf of the drug companies, by the US Supreme Court. He did, but the pharmaceutical companies still received a 23% additional tax break for their companies in Puerto Rico which made these American-outlawed drugs for sale to Third World countries' 43 . As is revealed in Addendum 3 on pa ge 679, Dan Quayle has subsequently allegedly been engaged in fi nding 'placement' opportunities for the endless streams of drug-trafficking proceeds which are la undered via so-called 'hedge funds'. Since this flow-of-funds is relentless and ne ver-ending, the primary objective of its 'hidden' managers is to find 'investment opportunities' so that the funds can conveniently be placed or invested as quickly as possible, after having be en 'parked' with hedge fund accounts. This explains why Dan Quayle's investigations have involved seeking 'investment' opportunities in the shape of a rescued Japanese bank and bankrupt airlines, including Air Canada. The fact that a target organisation is commercially unviable or effectively bankrupt is not, in this context, a barrier to such 'buyout' investments. On the contrary, organisations in such an advanced stage of commercial and financial decrepitude may be ideal depositories for such laundered funds, given that they necessarily require financial injections that are significantly larg er than viable enterprises, by an order of magnitude. Since the flow of drug-traffic king proceeds has at times been far greater than the flow of funds arising from oil and gas transactions (although the much higher oil price structure (in mid-2006) brought the two sources of Black funds into line), an army of 'specialists' such as the alleged Illuminati operative Dan Quayle is engaged in seeking out bolt-holes for the never-ending and ever-ballooning ca scade of global drug remittances."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale EUGENICS AND MIND- AND PERSONALITY CONTROL An addendum to the activities of the Bush-linked H. Smith Richardson Foundation may conveniently be included here. Averill Harriman (1913), involved in racial purity issues and the mastermind of the eugenics movement, had based this activity at Yale University, where the American Eugenics Society maintained its headquarters. Tarpley and Chaitkin reported in 1992 that 'the coercive psychiatry and ster ilization advocates had made the Yale/New Haven Hospital and Yale Medical School thei r laboratories for hands -on practice in brain surgery and psychological experimentation' - one of the lines of enquiry controlled by Himmler in Nazi Germany which were continued in the United States after the importation of a large number of Nazi scientists from 1946 on wards [see Chapter 8]. 'And the Birth Control League was there, which had long trumpeted the need for eugenical births - fewer births for parents with 'inferior' bloodlin es. Prescott Bush's partner Tighe was a Connecticut director of the League, and the Connecticut League's medical advisor was the eugenics advocate Dr Winternitz' (of German extracti on, naturally) 'of Yale Medical School.... In 1950, people who knew something about Presco tt Bush knew that he had very unsavoury roots in the eugenics movement. Eugenics and psychological mind- and personality-manipulation were twin obsessions of Heinrich Himmler's Nazi scientists. All projects initiated through the agency of Luciferians acquire a 'seething ener gy' of their own [see page 72] - a case in point being a Center for Creative Leadership par tly funded and established by the H. Smith Richardson Foundation (linked to Bush Sr .), located north of Greensboro, North Carolina (not far from the seat of Amer ican/'world' Scottish Rite Freemasonry). An investigator for the Tarpley-Chaitkin book toured the facility in 1990 with a guide, who said that 'in these rooms, agents of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Secret Service are trained. He demonstr ated the two-way mirrors through which the Government employees are watched, while they are put through mind-bending psychodramas. The guide explained that \"virtually everyone who becomes a general\" in the US armed forces also goes through this \"trainin g\" at the Richardson Center. Another office of the Center for Creative Leader ship is in Langley, Virginia , at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Here also, Rich ardson's Center trains leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency . The Order of Skull and Bones, and most of the other 'fraternal' Yale University societies, with their secret passwords and handgrips, furnish naive and worldly young men with varying degrees of mental conditi oning and brainwashing, depending upon the witchcraft content of their rituals and go bbldegook - the 'Bones' cult being the most diabolical because, as discussed, it imposes an intensive crash-course upon the neophytes with the specific intent of inducing infestation and/or possession by evil spirits. The Author remembers an American graduate who suddenly appeared at Christ Church, Oxford, and stayed for one y ear. The physical appearance of this person was awesome and dark: frightening in fact. A generation or so later, the Author encountered this individual at a party in New York, and his physical appearance remained as dark as ever. He is listed as 'Bonesman' of a Class of the late 1940s. People's faces do not necessarily betray th e fact that the person concerned has dabbled in witchcraft: but they often do. While referred to by those on the inside as 'The Order' - a feature of many Illuminati organisations: indeed the use of this phrase is a definitive indication of Illuminati membership, as already mentioned - Skull and Bones is, as we have seen, also referred to by some as Chapter 322 of a German secret"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 65 society. Researchers usually leave this observation hanging in mid-air, failing to seek identification of the German secret societ y concerned. The Author believes, and is certain, that the German secret society in question is the Illuminati. Antony Sutton was unsure, in the 1980s, whether this sect had remained in existence after it was suppressed in Bavaria in the eighteenth century. This book proves that it exists, using new contemporary information, and drawing on multiple sources, old and new, to e xpose its cynically manipulative modus operandi. Skull and Bones is indeed a primary locus and spawning pond of the Illuminati virus in the United States. More and more evidence of this truth is bei ng brought together by researchers. In his book The Holocaust, the distinguished historian, Martin Gilbert, revealed that it was agreed at the notorious Wannsee Conference in 1942, when expansion of the Nazi 'Final Solution' was finalised under the cold supervision of SS Obergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heyrich and the Gestapo chief Heinrich Himml er and other top Nazis, that should the 'Final Solution' not be completed by Nazi Germany, this agenda for the completion of the 'Final Solution' and the implementation of a New World Order would be transplanted over time to the United States [see Chapter 8]. When Hitler invoked his Thousand-Year Reich, he was not simply bragging. In The Twisted Cross by Joseph Carr, it was further revealed that when Hitler arrived in the Bavarian Alps, he would climb up into the mountains and scream into the wind for Satan to possess him, and to give him power to become the Antichrist reigning on earth for a thousand years. Furthermore, Hitler was trained, in his early years, by Jesuits, like Weishaupt. The Nazi regime was an operation of the Illuminati: and the Third Reich has installed itself in Washington, DC - a process that began almost immediately following the Second World War, while the world was being diverted by the distraction of the emerging Cold War which froze relations be tween the West and another product of the Illuminati, Stalin's Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union and Bloc, for a pre-ordained period of precisely 40 years (the Berlin Wall was dismantled in 1989 just as soon as the 40 years had been completed). How this happened, and what the implications are for the United States - which is today equipped with the apparatus (concentration camps, an Amtrak gassing facility in Indianapolis, special trains for the removal of dissidents, guillotines etc) is now quite well understood - thanks to extensive recent research and, once again, diligent work that has been published inter alia on the Internet. This narrative is continued in Chapter 4, entitled The Hex of Himmler. The Author interpolates here an interesting discovery that he made in June 2005, while interviewing and recording the observations of a distinguished US operative whose past work for the US Presidency has no equal. When the Author pointed out that certain nefarious US official policies and activities in the 1980s represented Works of Darkness and that he and others we re actually working for the Illuminati rather than for the President of the United States (POTUS), he remarked that , operationally, 'we didn't realise that, at the time. I understand it now'. And it is true that (other) former supporters of the New Underworld Order within the CIA are now actively fighting its implementation, which may be one of many reasons why the controllers' timetables are constantly slipping. One CIA operative told an informant: 'We even called this plan to seize America for the New World Order 'The Final Solution', and this is what we called it from inside the CIA'. This fact was volunteered when the CIA insiders concer ned revealed to the informant how they had themselves helped to design some of the concentration camps that will be activated when Martial Law is imposed in the United"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale States following another provocation by cut-outs for Germany's 'Black' DVD 45 . It seems almost superfluous to add that this evidence rein forces the Author's view that the criminalised Central Intelligen ce Agency its agencies and other dimensions of the US intelligence community are, or are fully capable of being, a reprobate menace to the American Republic and its people, and that it is a prerequisite for any possible resolution of the colossal US corruption a nd subversion crisis, that the intelligence services are sharply disciplined, cut down to size, and forced to comply with the Rule of Law, as President Kennedy once intended (an intention which cost him his life, of course). The irony is that this may not be possible wi thout intervention by the military - which is itself Masonically corrupted, and cannot, it s eems, be relied upon to act solely in the interests of the American people. If the necessary crackdown were to occur, those who need to be rounded up would need to be taken from the intelligence structures themselves: they could all be 'comfortably' housed in just one of the odious concentration camps that they have devised and installed, in pursuit of the transferred Nazi 'Final Solution' abomination. The 'Brotherhood of Death' - a.k.a. Skull and Bones, a.k.a. The Order, formerly the Russell Trust Association (inc orporated in 1856), more recent ly (in 1961) reorganised as RTA Incorporated - is the primary generationa l source of the Nazi Illuminati (Illuminazi) mentality that can be detected in elements of US society and within parts of its colossal interlinked intelligence and political/policymaking structures. The Society's members, mindful that the skull on their symbol has no mandible, so that it cannot 'speak', are sworn to silence; and all non-members are known as 'outsiders' or 'vandals' (Weishaupf s 'profane'). Since th e publication of the cited works by Antony Sutton and Andrei Navrozov on Skull a nd Bones, certain Russell Trust papers previously available for perusal in the Sterling Library at Yale, have disappeared. There is naturally no requirement for s ecrecy, unless the holder of secrets has something to hide: secrets are superfluous if there is nothing to conceal. Initiates are required to leave the room if an yone present raises issues involving a mention of Skull and Bones; and they are precluded, under oath, from answering questions about The Order and its organisations. When Andrei Navrozov attempted, via correspondence, to procure a response to a question about The Order from President Bush (Sr.), he drew the standard response that this was a matter he could not discuss. Kris Millegan explains, on page 20 of his book, that 'when Don Schollander (Skull and Bones, 1968), the Olympic Gold Medallist and only known Skull and Bones member living in Portland, Oregon, was contacted by local Wilamette Week reporter John Schrang regarding his involvement with The Order, he said: 'If s really something I can't talk about' 46 . But the precautions that The Brotherhood of Death has taken over the years to prevent the leakage of its secrets, based in part on blood oaths, have been very far from successful, so that a substantial body of information about its filthy, depraved occult-pagan ritual activities has entered into the public domain in recent years. In summary, as a result of the le akage of these secrets, it is clear that The Order practices a form of mind- and personality-manipulation through sexual abuse. It is well known that personality-splitting techniques developed by the Nazis and elaborated inter alia by US intelligence through its MK-ULTRA and related programmes can involve the exploitation of sexual abuse, which is the means whereby the pe rsonality is destabilised and 'split'. For True Christians, this is the mechanism whereby the victim's will is neutralised and he (or she) is led to invite evil spirits in - the opposite"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 67 procedure to the means whereby Jesus Christ reveals Himself to us, after we have believed on Him and taken steps to become fami liar with His Word (even if we have only just started this process). Here is th e Scripture reading which confirms this: 'Behold I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me' 47 . Instead of opening the door, by the exercise of their free will, to Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, initiates of The Brotherhood of Death have invited other forces in; and if they recognise their error later in life, they may encounter extreme diffi culty in expelling them - which can only be achieved in the context of total repentance, a contrite heart, and an effort of will: although it certainly can be done, as most of us have the chance for personal salvation. 'Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool' 48 . By the time that it dawns upon the trapped initiate that he has been led towards perdition, the riches which have accrued consequent upon his service to Lucifer, the 'god of this world', may have smothered any desire to change course, which may well be far too uncomfortable to be contemplated. According to the late Antony C. Sutton, the acknowledged pioneer and expert on The Order, Ron Rosenbaum may have been correct in deducing that the other two 'Senior Societies' at Yale - Scroll & Key and Wolf's Head, supposedly competitive societies also founded in the 19th century - are part of the same network. 'Senior Societies' exist, apparently, only at Yale. In an article published in Esquire in September 1977, Rosenbaum stated ('very accurately', accordi ng to Sutton) that 'anyone in the Eastern Liberal Establishment who is not a member of Skull & Bones is almost certainly a member of either Scroll & Key or Wolf's Head' 49,50 . In one ritual, Rosenbaum explained (in a magazine accustomed to touching upon such matters), the in itiate emerges from the Tomb naked, engaged in mud-wrestling with another initiate, a sequence ending in anal intercourse. The article, based on details of the initiation ceremony in question, which took place in 1940, contained inte r alia the following statements: 'McGeorge Bundy wrestled baked in a mud pile as part of his initiation'. 'Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart... dresse d up in a skeleton suit, howled wildly at an initiate in a red velvet room inside the Tomb...'. Ron Rosenbaum's Esquire article further descri bed part of that initiation ceremony thus: 'New man placed in coffin - carried into th e central part of building. New man chanted over and reborn into society. Removed from coffi n and given robes with symbols on it [sic]. A bone with his name on it is tossed into [human] bone heap at start of evening. Initiates plunged naked into mud pile'. Antony Sutton explains as follows on page 201 of his book on this subject, citing the very respected researcher Rosenbaum as his source: 'According to Rosenbaum, \"one can hear strange cries and moans coming from the bowels of the tomb during initiation. Four elements of the initiation ceremony are recorded: (1) That the initiate has to lie nake d in a sarcophagus; (2) That he is required to tell the \"secrets\" of his sex life to fellow initiate s; (3) That patriarchs dressed as skeletons and acting as wild-eyed lunatics howl and scr eech at new initiates; and (4) that initiates are required to wrestle naked in a mud pile\"'. It should be recalled that this reprobate debauchery is indulged in by the initiates under immense peer pressure. Having been programmed to lust after membership, its achievement locks them into the sarcophagus of Lucifer for the rest of their lives."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"68 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale MAIN FEATURES OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER ACCORDING TO SUTTON Sutton's conclusion, which has never been cont radicted and which is consistent with all the reliable research that has emerged on this subject in recent years, although it is incomplete, is that The Order is indeed a component of the sect of the Illuminati [see Chapter 7] and that it exists in order to bri ng about the establishment of a German-dominated New World Order - namely, \"a planned order wi th heavily restricted individual freedom, without Constitutional protection, without national boundaries or cultural distinction', and that the characteristics of this New World Order - which will facilitate the triumph of criminalism, hence 'New Underworld Order' - will be as fo llows (Sutton's list having been compiled in the 1970s, so that much of what he predicte d has since materialised, as all serious students of this vast subject will be aware): 1. Education will be perverted in order to prescribe and dictate how the population will be required to behave [ = fo r instance, Outcome-Based Education]. 2. Money: Wealth and the exchange of goods will be controlled by the New Underworld Order elite, namely by the highest ranks of the Illuminati. 3. The Law will exist as a mechanism for the enforcement not of justice, but rather of the arbitrary will of the state, re gional and world government, world law and the world legal and court systems. This is of course already the case in the European Union context, where the European Court of Justice exists specifically not to dispense justice, but to enforce the will of the Collective, and to advance its agenda. 4. Politics will be manipulated so as to ensu re its absolute consistency with the Illuminati's requirements, directing each state or regional bloc. Democracy will be false, elections will be overtly rigged, and 'undesirable' Representatives, Senators or Members of Parliament will be ruthlessly weeded out, so that they cannot serve as roadblocks to the implementation of th e global New Underworld Order strategy. Independent publishers such as this Author will be stalked, spied upon and framed to eliminate them from the scene. It is hardly n ecessary to elaborate that this state of affairs exists 'as we speak' in both the US and the British and European contexts. See further comments on the manipulation of 'democracy' in Figure 21, panel opposite, on page 69]. 5. The Economy will exist purely to enable the illuminised elite to accumulate additional wealth. Note: There is an obvious conflict here: One of the elements of the Illuminati's programme which Antony Sutt on may not have fully anticipated is the 'population reduction' plan, which has been discussed for instance at successive Illuminati Gorbachev Foundatio n/State of the World (= 'World State') Forum events in the United States. At the first of thes e mammoth mind-manipul ation and influence- building fests, held in San Francisco in 1995, the proposition that 90% of the world's population needed to be eliminated, 'to protect the planet', was promulgated. The AIDS epidemic is doing a 'fine job' on this particular score in Southern Africa, where, in Zimbabwe (where a roll of toilet paper cost Z$200,000 in June 2006), at least 2 million people were expected to die of starvatio n in 2005 alone. Such an outcome would be absolutely perfect for cadres of the Illuminati, who can then (they surmise) move in and take over Zimbabwe's rich mineral and other resour ces: which is why not a finger has been lifted against the odious Stalinist dictatorship of the ogre Mugabe. But the snag is: if the workforce has perished or been liquidated, (a ) who will, e.g., work the mines, and (b) to whom will end-products be sold, so that the Illuminists can be enriched? As with all the inventions of the Devil, they haven't thought this one through properly. And as all their schemes generate chaos and confusion, they'll never be able to do so."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 69 Figure 21: HYPOCRISY, LIES AND INSTABILITY An extraordinary feature of those who deal in lies is that they come to believe them, as Dr Josef Goebbels found out. Not only did he and Hitler succeed in selling their lies as truth to the German people, but Mr Schicklgruber came to believe them himself. A case in point, unfortunately, is President George W. Bush (Jr.), who very tactlessly informed the Iranian people on 16th June 2005 that their Gener al Election would 'change nothing'. The Iranian people, he said, 'deserve a genuinely democratic system in which elections are honest, and in which their leaders answer to them, instead of the other way round'. The Rest of the World was left speechless at this hypocritical arrogance. This was indeed a shocking statement - and was received in Tehran as such - coming from a man whose elections in 2000 and 2004 were stolen, according to the most reliable information to hand. In 2000, James Baker III allegedly obtained $40 million from Carlos Lehder, a US-German llluminati asset who had been instrumental in setting up the drug cartels in Colombia (which are creations of US intelligence: see Chapter 3), in exchange for his release from US custody and his transfer to Germany. Al Gore was told, upon alighting from a limousine, that he had not, after all, as he had been advised when he had climbed into it, won the electi on; some $32 million was allegedly handed over to the Democratic National Committee in exchange for their conceding the elec tion, while $8.0 million was allegedly spent to bribe officials, prison staff, judges, lawyers, etc., to observe omerta. In 2004, the election was rigged el ectronically [see Addendum 1, p. 662], and a consignment of gold (looted from the basement of the Twin Towers?) was allegedly paid to John Kerry. According to author Kris Millegan, Robert P. Johnson, a.k.a. William Barr, an operative, informed William Clinton in Arkansas, while he was the corrupt Go vernor of that corrupt State, that 'you are our fair-haired boy, but you do have competition for the job you seek' (of President of the United States). 'We would never put all our eggs in one basket. You an d your State have been our greatest asset' (for an explanation of which, see Chapter 3). 'Mr Casey' (the Director of Central Intelligence) 'wanted me to pass on to you that unless you *** up [sic] and do some thing stupid, you are Number One on our short list for the job you always wanted' ['Fleshing Out Sk ull and Bones', Ed. Kris M illegan, op. cit., page 18]. Thus William Casey, the Director of the Cent ral Intelligence Agency, who was also a Sovereign Knight of Malta, signalled to William Clinton, th rough George Bush Sr.'s last Attorney General (like Bush Sr., and Clinton, an intelligence operative), that provided he (Clinton) didn't 'mess up', the intelligence community would instal him as President. In other words, it is not the electorate who choose the presidential candidates, it is the intelligence community - an intolerable usurpation of power by an organisation that is supposed to SERVE the Executive Branch, rather than to CONTROL it. As in the 'former' Soviet Union, it is the intelligence communi ty that's in the driving seat -which means that American democracy is just as much of a sham as Pr esident George W. Bush Jr. said that the Iranian version is. And what is so disturbing about this is that the Washington elite apparently assumed that Iranians, who are heirs of a much older civilisation than that of the United States and are highly sophisticated, are ignorant of the fact that US democracy is a sham, and has been a sham for more three decades - at least since President Carter was replaced by Ronald R eagan and George Bush Sr., following the deception operation known as the 'October Surprise'. In actual fact, the US Presidency has proved to he a highly unstable institution. In the modern era, the President of the United States has been assassinated, removed or imposed consecutively ever since the Eisenhower era. And most sensible, informed analysts now believe that Kennedy's murder was a Ge rman-inspired CIA 'inside job', with the actual culpability, if ever allowed to emer ge, liable to shock the whole world. It is therefore grossly inappropriate for ANY President of the United States to lecture the Iranians, the Russians, or anyone else, about so-called 'democracy'. Likewise, given the emasculated condition of British democracy, the rigorous controls that ha ve been legislated for over the qualifications of candidates, and the oppressive overhang of the instit utions of the corrupt, Leninist, duplicated EU structures, no British Prime Minister should use such rhetoric either. We should remove the rotten motes from our own hard eyes first. ■"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"70 C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale 6. History will be bastardised, rewritten and manipulated to promulgate lies and to represent evil as good, and good as evil, wh ich is of course scripturally verboten. 7. Mass psychology will be used to manipulate the way people think. 'Psy-Ops' w ill be openly and ruthlessly conducted by the o fficial propagandists in order to hide and misrepresent what is happening on a national and a global scale. [This process is today working 24/7 and overtime, as all who are not sitting on their brains can understand. Some intelligence operatives who are engaged in the colossal US domestic 'Psy-Ops' operation have expressed surprise to the Author and to one of his special US contacts, that we understand so much of what is going on: for instance, absurdly, we are not supposed to have fathomed that the US and British political systems are controlled, so that it is almost neither here nor there who wins an election, as the Il lum-inati always win. Apparently we weren't supposed to have be en clever enough to work this out. The intelligence officer who realised that the Author's US contact understood this perfectly well, was astounded, and somewhat rattled. 8. Philanthropy will be exclusively Pharisaical, so that people (the goyim) think well of the controllers. For example, on 10th June 2006, Mikhail Gorbachev, supreme head of the KGB Continuum, held a vulgar white-tie banquet at Althorp, the Spencer family's Northamptonshire estate, ostensibly in aid of the raisa Gorbachev Foundation. The fawning British 'mainstream' media lavished nauseous praise on his 'philanthropy'. 9. Medicine will provide the state with sole power over health, life and death. This was a primary control objective, by the way, of the Illuminati's prize disciple, Lenin. 10. Religion will be totally paganised and perv erted so that the 'Ancient Mysteries' (occultism, kabbalistic magic, and all the relate d abominations including the summoning up of evil spirits) will be condoned, encouraged or facilitated. Note: The Author distinguishes, in the 'Christian' context, between 'Churchianity' which, as the staggering decadence of the Church of England demonstrates, is largely alien to 'the Way the Life and the Truth', and True Christianity, based on Faith, Grace and Scripture. 11. Media: The broadcast and print media will be controlled, so that what people think and know will be in the hands of the controllers. This is the situation today. 12. Continuity: The controlling Illuminised el ite will appoint its own followers and disciples to ensure longevity into future generations: The Thousand-Year Reich. They have pursued this objective with succes s for several generations already. Although this Author has somewhat elaborated the late Antony Sutton's twelve identified objectives, which were first prophesied by him in 1977, it can be seen that they have been largely accomplished - which is why the world is now experiencing a crisis of historically unprecedented proportions. Specifically, the educational system has been hijacked, to produce young people with the 'politi cally correct attitudes' and little or zero profound knowledge, especially of Scripture and history, and to provide space for abominations such as 'sex education' and 'd eath education'. The creation of money is in the hands of geomasonically controlled cen tral and commercial banks, which have usurped de facto control over, and have in ma ny cases stolen, or used for self-interested collateral and cross-collateralisation leverage and hypothecation purposes, untold trillions of US Government fiat money funds held in o ffshore accounts of US Government Title 18, Section 6 intelligence corporations which were originally legitimised under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333, of 1981 [see box, page 20].

The political democratic system has been perverted in both Britain and the United States so that there is no true democracy at all: what happens at elections is that there may be a change of selected controlled personnel, that's all. This, as will be seen in Chapter 7, is 100% in conformity with long-range Illuminati strategy. With the constant enlargement of corpor ations and the free-wheeling expansion of certain types of business such as bookstore chains (which are major absorbers of the endless pipeline of drug money), economic and financial power is being consolidated into fewer and fewer hands. The bookstores are also major outlets for the mass distribution of diabolical 'noise' 'music' CDs and Satanic videos, which are swamping the minds and souls of young people to the virtual exclusion of all else in the United States - consistently, as we have seen, with the death orientation of the Illuminati cadres that are promoting this Luciferian filth. History is being and has been rewritten, so that British schoolchildren have hardly any awareness of English history, but know all about colonialism, global warming and other 'politically correct' issues. Psychology has long since been perverted to manipulate minds and to divide per- sonalities both individually and collectively, to break down the family, to split the sexes, and to control the masses, inter alia through the proliferation, especially in the United States, of endless, pernicious Psychological Operations ('Psy-Ops', perpetrated by cadres of intelligence operatives, at ever y level. The abuse of philanthropy, so that the 'benefactor's' good works' are extensively publicised, and the general public is indoctrinated with 'politically correct' 'causes' and 'good works' which serve the double-minded interests of the Illuminati, is routine. The abuse of medicine through such devices as the contamination of vaccines, co mpulsory vetting of children with mandatory prescribed interventions, and the dispensing of death by staff working to intelligence instructions, is known in some US institutions. Euthanasia, or Satanic legitimised 'mercy murder', was being debated in the confused British Parliament in May 2006. Organised religion has been degraded and perverted, with the reprobate Church of England being led, for instance, by a confirmed Druid, given to complex, convoluted, interminable and spiritually barren pronouncements, and its activities being characterised by an almost total lack of spirituality and a wholesale departure from the teachings of Jesus Christ; as for the Roman Catholic religion, its commonly acknowledged faults are legion; and the abuses perpetrated by many of its priests as a consequence of the reprobate, unnatural and repressive prohibition against priests marrying, need no introduction. The media is perceived by thinki ng people in the United States and Britain to be controlled, with US intelligence known to be proud of its 'achievement' in bringing the print and broadcast media under its thumb. Indeed, this boast was explicitly made at a US intelligence conference attended by one of our contacts, and was presented as the CIA's most impressive achievement. In the United Kingdom, it has for many years been impossible for analysts such as this Author to carry on any meaningful conversation at all with a 'mainstream' British journalist, since th e minds of such people are clogged with preconceived notions, with bogies and 'slides' such as their facile acceptance of the lie that there is no such thing as a conspiracy, with 'politically correct' opinions, and with an underlying arrogance which almost defies description. For this reason, the Author considers it a complete waste of time to engage with such people, and prefers to disseminate his work 'by other means'."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale THE KABBALISTIC NUMBER 322 AND LUCIFER'S 'SEETHING POWERS' A few further points need to be made abou t 322, before we examine the international drugs dimension that the ffluminati, through the Brotherhood of Death, have integrated into US strategy. The significance of the use of the Kabbalistic 'magic' number, 322, is explained in a number of parallel ways. William Russell, the heir to a drug-running business, imported the blueprint of the society from Germany in 1832, as we have seen, so the most basic 'line' is that The Order is the second chapter of a German secret society (a branch of the ffluminati) est ablished in 1832, hen ce 322. Confusingly, though, there are rooms designated 323 and 324 in the Tomb on the Yale campus. A more sophisticated, and probably more accurate parallel source of The Order's obsession with 322 (although some di smiss this as a quaint fable) is that it stands for the homosexual orator Demosthenes who comm itted suicide by taking poison - the preferred 'liquidation method' of the ffluminati: hence the skull and crossbones on bottles of poison - in the temple of Neptune in Calauria, in 322 BC Although the names of Skull and Bones ne ophytes are changed upon initiation, the membership list (known as 'Addresses') is made available to each member, using the initiates' real names. These names are prov ided in a copy bound in black leather with peculiar symbols inside and outside. The owner's name and the letter 'D' are gilt-stamped on the outer cover of the earlier issues whic h have emerged into the public domain, at least to the end of the 19th century. The list is surrounded by a heavy black border, signifying the death of the named initiate, as he adopts his new 'Bones name' - i.e. has been 'reborn' into this 'death cult', which is both nonsensical and upside-down, that is to say, entirely typical of a fraud perpetra ted by the Evil One, who is the author of confusion and lies. Moreover, crucially, lies are followed by (spiritual and/or physical death: the two go together: as Jesus Christ told the murderous Pharisees (who were plotting to liquidate him: 'Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and a bode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar and the father of it' 51 . In the pure light of this Truth, we can see all the more clearly, then, why Skull and Bones is also called The Brotherhood of Death. It is a sel f-perpetuating nest of lies and death indoctrination. As such it is a deadly menace to the American public, to the American people, and to the whole wo rld. Through self-replicating mechanisms such as those perpetrated by Skull and Bones, devilish practices, debaucheries, infestations and demonic possessions of past decades are perpetuated and projected indefinitely into the future. The ceremonial fixation with the initiate be ing lowered into a coffin and then 'rising again' from it, is modelled upon and is an echo of the 'raising to life' of the candidate in the Pyramid Mysteries, as explained by the 33rd Degree Mason, Manly P. Hall, in \"The Lost Keys of Freemasonry or The Secret of Hiram Abiff [see Figure 16, page 45]. Hall makes it crystal clear that Masonic initiation into the 'cra ff (= witchcraft) is intended to infest the initiate with the power of evil. This admission is contained in Hall's promise that the initiate will acquire knowledge of 'the dynamo of living power', through which he will 'learn the mystery of his craft [i.e., of witchcraft]. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands' 52 . And he is unknowingly en route to perdition. Antony Sutton reported that 'the first class list of 1833 has two blank lines in place of the eleventh name on the list. This supports the argument that the society has German origins and this is the listing of the anonymous German connection' 53 ."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 73 In calculating and expressing a given year, the Brotherhood of Death adds 322 to the current year, so that 2006 is 2006 + 322 = 2328. Demosthenes is alleged to have founded a Greek patriotic society in the same year th at he committed suicide, and is also reported to have been a proponent of murderous Satanic practices. Plutarch wrote about Demosthenes as follows: [Demosthenes] 'was meagre and sickly from the first, and hence had his nickname of Batalus given him, it is said, by the boys, in derision of his appearance; Batalus being, as some tell us, a certain enervated flute-player, in ridicule of whom Antiphanes wrote a play. Others speak of Batalus as a writer of wanton verses and drinking songs. And it would seem, too, that some part of the body, not decent to be named, was at that time called batalus by the Athenians. But the name of Argas, which they also say was a nickname of Demosthenes, was given him becau se of his behaviour, as being savage and spiteful, argas being one of the poetical words for a snake; or for his disagreeable way of speaking. Argas being [also] the name of a poet who composed very harshly and disagreeably. So much, as Pl ato says, for such matters' 54 . According to the wife of a 'Bonesman' who must remain anonymous, each initiate has the letter 'D' stamped or etched in the small of his back. Yo ung American women, when considering whether to become engaged to a high-flying young Yale Graduate, need, as a routine precaution, to investig ate whether their beau has this bodily characteristic; and if such a mark is discover ed, should consider carefully whether they wish their lives to be encumbered with the dark consequences of his initiation into The Order of Skull and Bones. In 1928, Clarence W. Mendel wrote a critical article about the Yale secret societies, especially the three Senior Societies, in 'Y ale Daily News', in which he inaccurately con- cluded as follows: 'They [the secret societies] can be a blessing to Yale, and Yale will not tolerate their being a curse'. This is the absolute reverse of the truth: these secret societies, especially Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head (i f the second and thir d are, as Rosenbaum believed, part of the same network), are a curse to Yale; and Yale has persistently tolerated them and has allowed them to become institutionalised: so that Yale therefore tolerates them being a curse. As a consequence, Yale College is itself a Black curse upon the American people, upon US society, upon its political system and establishment, and through these, upon the whole world. It is an engine of witchcraft, a pernicious and evil Illuminazi nest of death and abomination; and until its baleful influence, which overwhelms any positive contributions Yale may have made to society, is removed, it will continue to spread its accursed evil throughout the United States and the world. Most of all, Yale stands for double-mindedness, which is the essence of the curse of the two-faced, dialectically-oriented Illuminati. 'A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways'. Instability, confusion, lies, cynicism, cold-heartedness, self-absorption and double-dealing are the marks of the 'Bonesman' Illuminist. Among normal people, double-mindedness is a hazard of our humanity, and a challenge to be overcome, as we progress spiritually. But the Illuminati base their entire approach to geopolitics upon a deliberate strategy of double-mindedness.

In this verse, the scribes accused Jesus of being possessed of the Devil (Beelzebub) and of casting out devils by invoking the Dev il. 'Bonesmen' are effectively pledged, th rough repulsive initiation rites, to the Devil. This alone could explain The Order 's use of 322. The Lord makes it quite plain that to accuse Him of being possessed by Satan and of casting out devils in the name of the Devil, represented a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, for which no forgiveness is possible. This warning is given in the context of the scribes' mentioned lie that he was casting out devils by the power of Satan: 'Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forg iven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewithsoever they shall blaspheme: Bu t he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation; Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit' and that he was casting out devils by invoking Beelzebub. [Mark, Chapter 3, verses 28-30]. 2. Mark, Chapter 3, verses 23-26. 3. 'Get thee behind me, Satan'. If we tell him to get lost, he and his demons cannot harm us, because he cannot destabilise us - unless we invite or make it possible fo r him and them to do so. 'Then saith Jesus unto him, Get t hee hence, Satan: for it is wri tten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the Devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto Him' [Matthew, Chapter 4, verses 10-11]. See also Luke, Chapter 4, verse 8. 4.

And the Lord sa id unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it'. 6. First Epistle of Pefer, C hapter 5, verse 8: 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour '. Peter then gives us the hope which is of the Holy Spirit (verses 9-11): 'Whom resist steadfast in the fa ith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. But the God of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, settle you.

Mark, Chapter 9, verse 42: 'And whos oever shall offend one of thes e little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were ca st into the sea'. And in Luke, Chapter 17, verses 1 and 2, the Lord's warning to those who corrupt children is crystal clear: 'Then said he unto his disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come; but woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend on e of these little ones'. In the New Testament of Jesus Christ, where a severe warning is repeated, it addresses an iss ue of exceptional gravity. It is clear, for those who have ears to hear and eyes to s ee, that offending (corrupting) little children and young people is an offence so grievous that no forgiveness is possible: in other words, such offence represent s blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, for which the Lord tells us elsewhere that no forgiveness is obtainable. Jesus makes this crystal clear in Matthew Chapter 12, verses 31-32: 'Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall no t be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man [Jesus], it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come'. This is repeated in Ma rk, Chapter 3, verses 28-29: 'Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewithsoever they shall blaspheme; But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation'.

It s hould be noted that many llluminist organisations are referred to internally as 'The Order' - including Ordo Templi Orientis, Opus Dei, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), and the sect of the llluminati, which has infiltrated governance and key organisations - in cluding Freemasonry, the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and many others. Indeed, as observed elsewhere in this book, the use of the term 'The Order' to describe an or ganisation or sect signifies that the organisation in question is a co mponent of the llluminati. All are mechanisms of mind-control and personality modification. 14. These details are taken from the summary by Kris Millegan in 'Flesh ing out Skull and Bones', op.cit, pages 1 et seq..

Luke, Chapter 17, verse 21: 'Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! For, behold, the Kingdom of God is within you'. See also Acts, Chapter 8, verse 48: 'Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands'. Temple- and cathedral-building is spiritually diversionary. Speculative masonry is therefore itself derived from a spiritual blind alley. 32. // Corinthians, Chapter 11, verse 14. The entire passage (verses 13-15) is of crucial importance for anyone who wishes to see through the diversions of the Devil, including those per petrated by fake formal religion: 'For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming them selves into the apostles of Christ. And no ma rvel: for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness, whose end shal l be according to their works'. But in the case of The Order of Skull and Bones, this abomination is so evil that no attempt is made to hide its filthiness, its foul-mouthed vulgarity, and its Satanic orientation. The Order's attempts to cover up its devilish occultic aberrations have become less and less effective in recent years, and the truly abominable nature of this Curse of Yale has been and is being exposed. This is happening becaus e, as Jesus Christ clearly warned, no evil secrets can be covered up for ever. The criminalised intelligence community exerts massive energy in covering up past criminal operations, or botches, thereby re vealing that it is perfectly well aware that the activities in question (such as drug operations) are criminal abominations. Let the Lord speak clearly to those who have ears to hear and eyes to see: 'For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither wa s anything kept secret, but that it should come abroad' [Mark, Chapter 4, verse 22]; 'For THE HEAD OF GERMAN 'BLACK' INTELLIGENCE In October 2005, intelligence operatives attended the M unich Beer Festival - accompanied by an overhead satellite. Why did they need a satellite at the Beer Fest ? Because the real reason for their presence at this convivial event was not to get themselves legless on Ba varian brews, but rather to monitor the HQ of German long-range Nazi Continuum strategic deception intelli gence, based at Dachau, ne ar Munich - Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst. In the same m onth, the Author published an issue of his financialjournal International Currency Review, in which the late Sir Edward Heath, Lord (Roy) Jenkins, and Geoffrey Rippon (who, with Heath, signed the British EEC Accession Treaty) were exposed as agents of the Abwehr (DVD), so that the Treaty, having been signed by traitors engaged in strategic deception, was and remains null and void. The Author also exposed the fact that successive EU Collective treaties have been procured by means of corrupt 'payola' payments - naming specific sums paid to key political figures in exchange fo r their services in trying to procure the failed European Constitution Treaty. As a consequence of the Dachau surveillance operati on identified above, it has been confirmed to this Author that George H. W. Bush Sr. was (as of 2006) allegedly th e actual head of the German 'Black' agency - while other significant DVD penetrations were identified. So the wr iting is on the wall for t he German long-range strategic deception planners, who, though in control of accumulate d stolen funds on a prodigious scale, thought that their cover was impenetrable, and that any complicity in the 9/ 11 and 7/7 atrocities would never be discovered. As always, they went too far, and may pay a heavy price. ■"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 77 nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid, that shall not be known and come abroad' [Luke, Chapter 8, verse 17]. 33. Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 2 verses 1-8: 'And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of ev ery nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because t hat every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? And now hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?' There follows a list of the foreign places from which the Jews of the diaspora, who were at Jerusalem, came, and the languages in which the Apostles and disciples who were filled with the Holy Spirit, were speaking. In other words, what they said made perfect sense in these foreign languages: whereas, in the instance of false 'speaking in tong ues' described in the main text, the output heard by the Author over the telephone was chaotic, hideous, without meaning, joined-up and, to anyone not 'in the Word', would have sounded terrifying. Because it was diabolical. 34. This was an extremely unpleasant experience. Not onl y did this character unleash a torrent of meaningless demonic gobbldegook three times during the extensive conversati on, but he progressively twisted Scripture until it was obvious that he was beyond aberrant. In retrospect it appear ed that the object of this exercise was to test the Author's faith and knowledge of Scripture, as certain llluminati intelligence cadres hav e been working for years on ways to demolish Christian faith, which is done inter alia by studying those whose faith is very strong, to identify why it 'works' and thus what methods can most effectively be us ed to neutralise it. All such efforts have historically failed and will of course continue to fail, sinc e 'Heaven and Earth will pass away, but my words shall not pass away' [Matthew, Chapter 24, verse 35] The operative then demanded that we send him ALL our publications, shouting 'I want everything you publish. I don't care what it costs, d'you hear me?' So we duly obliged. It was bizarre, and indicative of how deranged many of these people are. 35. There is really little difference between the evil enticement by these means of naive, if headstrong, young undergraduates, and the corruption of children. Both deny the individual the opportunities which life offers and represent blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. 36.The identity of the lady who provided the late Anto ny Sutton with the bound copy containing very extensive historical listings of 'Bonesm en' is known to the Author. 37.

The problem with the book is that it was published by 'Executi ve Intelligence Review', an organisation run by the alleged counterintelligence operative Lyndon Larouche, who was a Marxist-Leninist agitator in the 1960s. However several researchers working for this outfit have excellent track records, so it is problemat ical for analysts to accept this source as genuine. On the one hand, the organisation publishing such material is hampered by an allegedly unfavourable reputation, while on the other hand some of their analysts work to the highest standards. All other considerations aside, the main problem with the analyses undertaken by these people is their habit of stringing long lines of connections together and drawing conclusions from the links such connections allegedly imply. All res earch into Skull and Bones, and into the history of the Bush family and the Nazi connections of Prescott Bush, su ffer from this problem: in particular, 'straight' Skull and Bones research cannot avoid extensive analyses of the relevant personnel and their connections and activities both at Yale College and afterwards. The sober analyst must therefore be on guard; but as with all such research, truth and factual information can be recognised for what it is, and separ ated out from conjecture. The sources cited in this Chapter all pass necessary credibility tests: indeed, in 'Fleshing out Skull and Bones', the weakest essay is by an academic who plays around with 'conspiracy theory', obviously unaware that Leni n specifically proclaimed, in writing, that his Revolution was part of a massive conspiracy. The Au thor can illustrate the ki nd of linkages that are suspect, few of which are evident in these works, but wh ich do appear in past work by 'Executive In telligence Review'. For instance, the Author was both at Eton and an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford, at exactly the same time as Lord (Jacob) Rothschild. The kind of false analysis which is cr iticised here would deduce from these facts that Christopher Story knows, is in thrall to, acts on the instructions of, does the bidding of, is pa rt of the circle of, and advoc ates New World Order policies espoused by, Lord Rothschild, all of which statements would be untrue. Rothschild's estate lies only a few miles away from where the Author is writing this book: but nothing whatsoever can be r ead into this, just as none of the other speculations, if ever made (which they never have been) could be verified."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 2: The Curse of Yale 45.

THE PROPORTIONS OF THE CRIMINALISM CRISIS Criminalism is a word coined by the Author for use in hi s financial serial publications to distinguish officially sponsored criminal operations from 's tand-alone' mafia-style organised crime. Criminalism means the exploitation of state-sponsored criminal operations in the interests of strategy, an activity that is manifestly open to abuse. For instance, according to Pat Cameron, a former Los Angeles-based attorney for the US Secret Service/Treasury intelligence operative Leo Wanta, former President George Bush Sr. allegedly sought to withdraw $210 billion of funds from one of the myriad Title 18, Section 6 US Government inte lligence- sponsored corporations set up by Wanta for the implementation of state intelligence operations. Leo Wanta, a co-signatory of the account, refused to apply his signatu re, pointing out that the funds in the bank accounts of one of the offshore Ameritrust corporations belonged to the US Government, not to an individual. Partly because of his refusal to meet the former President's wishes, and because separately - in his role as a US Treasury/Secret Service analyst and Trustor - he wrote on a financial print-out that he was auditing 'Acceptance of value by former U.S. President of the United States George (Jorge) Bush is direct violation of our USA Title 5, Section 7353, et seq.: Jim Baker III told me to just \"Shut Up\", as I am protected by R ogers Houston Memorandum to Co-operate', but I kept Receipts & Notes', he was subsequently arrested on trumped-up charges, falsely alleged by officials to be dead, and made to suffer extreme humiliation and imprisonment/house arrest for an imposed period of many years: just for doing his duty. Separately, Hillary Clinton allegedly withdrew a very large sum of money from Grenada-based Crozier Bank. She and her CIA operative husband have acquired property in Ireland, to which they may intend to flee should the authorities fina lly decide that they must be prosecuted - there being no extradition treaty between Ireland and the United States. President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order 12333 [see box, page 20], which, in 1981, authorised the establishment by intelligence cadres of corporat ions at home and abroad for intelligence purposes, and for their sponsorship and ownership to be denied, opened up myriad opportunities for corruption by intelligence operatives. Powerful intelligence 'barons' and other senior figures who control US intelligence offshore bank accounts may be liable from time to time to be tempted to take some of the funds for their own purposes. So many instances of this behaviour have been identified by the Author that it is concluded that a proxy US mob gang war has been raging for years between cadres of operatives owing allegiance to competing- cooperating barons, as they struggle for control of colossal US financial assets. At the same time, trillions of dollars' worth of funds have been misappropriated. This is the mirror image of what has of course been routine practice in the criminalised 'former' USSR. Gorbachev's Politburo authorised similar 'private' corporations a decade after President Reagan's Executive Order 12333, as a consequence of which t he number of Soviet intelligence-linked corporations ballooned - many of them carrying the tell-tale suffix 'ex'. A similar situation has accordingly arisen in the 'former' Soviet Union, where the Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) officer serv ing as President, V. Putin, has been masterminding a campaign to force intelligence office rs like Mikhail Khodorkovsky to disgorge the 'assets of the state' which were 'temporarily' privatised into their hands in order to fool the international community with a 'new form' of Leninist 'state controlled capitalism'. In short, llluminati money operations typically devolve into ruthless criminal behaviour. ■"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 79 CHAPTER THREE THE LURE OF DRUGS DRUGS AS THE LUBRICANT OF THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER Because the Illuminati secretly run the global dr ug networks - as will be revealed by the Illuminati defector whose ghastly findings a bout this global control sect are reviewed in Chapter 7 - and because the historical connections between the Luciferian Skull and Bones society at Yale College and drug-trafficking have been discussed in Chapter Two, this Chapter addresses the drug-t rafficking dimension of the New Underworld Order. Specifically, it reveals the massive, decades-long involvement of German -linked elements of the United States' intelligence community in drug-trafficking - arguably the biggest sub- scandal of the myriad scandals touched upon in this book (which of course, necessarily scratches only the surface of th ese issues, since it is impossible (a) for any single human brain to encompass the enormity of what is going on and (b) no single individual can possibly, via the public domain, amass details of the innumerable drug-trafficking networks, scams and operations that are being worked overtime at any given moment). MAIN REASONS FOR THIS STUDY'S FOCUS ON THE UNITED STATES To start with, though, it is n ecessary to correct certain misapprehensions. First, this book is not intended as a blanket attack on the US intelligence community, but rather upon the rotten components of it which are manipulated by the (Dachau) Forces of Darkness. The Author knows that many honourable US intelli gence officers exist: indeed, he has had the privilege of knowing a few of them. These people are known to be disgusted and demoralised by the cancer of corruption, and not a little concerned at the magnificent opportunities it offers, by definition, to covert continuing enemies of the United States for blackmail, and for consolidation of the scourge of interpenetration which has immobilised intelligence agencies of the Great Powers. S econdly, the Author knows that it has been suggested, inaccurately, in some quarters that the Author has 'done an about face' - focusing on what is wrong in the West in general and the United States in particular, rather than, as in the past, on the Soviet dimension of the World Revolution. This is inaccurate: those who have made such allegations have failed to understand, or refuse to consider, the reality that the Illuminati's preferred methodology is to manipulate 'opposites' (the Hegelian dialectic), with the intention of creating the conditions for 'progress' towards their global control objective. In general terms, therefore, the division of ideologies into 'left' and 'right' is a crude, populist deception for consumption by the masses which observers and analysts need to see through, before any reliable understanding of the world's problems can emerge . The corollary to the unjust allegation in question is that the Author is not pa ying adequate attention to the continuing Russian/Soviet dimension of the criminalist onslaught upon the West. That is untrue: the first two books published by this Author's book publishing company,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Edward Harle Limited - The Perestroika Dece ption by the Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, and Red Cocaine, by Dr Joseph D. Douglass Jr. [see: www.edwardharle.com] - explicitly addressed the Soviet dimension of the World Revolution, and the covert Soviet drug offensive against the West. A further, late r, investigation - this Author's own analysis, The European Union Collective - revealed how the European Union, as Gorbachev proclaimed in London on 23rd March 2000 - is 'the New European Soviet'. The focus of this book on the United States re flects several considerations. First, the United States has long since imported, and integrated into its 'class' Zeitgeist primarily via Yale College, the entire baggage developed by the Illuminati, a hyperactive-ly powerful, evil sect born and bred in Germany which serves as a deep covert instrument for the fulfilment of long-range German strategy to es tablish irreversible global hegemony. This deep penetration has laid the basis for the unpr ecedented crisis that America faces today, because few US strategists have a clear grasp of its signifi cance. The Thousand-Year Reich' is a concept normally associated with Hitler: but in actual fact, it repr esents a long-term strategy elaborated by pan-Germans spanning the years from Frederick the Great, Bismarck, Haushofer and their Nazi heirs onwards. Secondly, this study's focus on the United States reflects the reality that Britain and the United States remain decisively 'the joint Main Enemy', in the eyes of both German (covert Nazi) and the Soviet (covert Marxist-Leninist) strategists, who have systematically, acting secretly together at th e intelligence level, subverted and decapitated British power and global authority, and are concurrently engaged in massive Fifth Column and subversion oper ations in the United States (although they both underestimate the huge military strength of the United Kingdom, which remains truly awesome). These strategists see control over the United States as the key to global control, which is why the United States is the primary target of covert continuing German (Nazi International) global deception strategy, masterminded by the Dachau-based Nazi 'Black' German intelligence service, Deutsche Ve rteidigungs Dienst, or DVD [covert German Defence Service] which, with back-up assistance from the parallel French 'Black' covert intelligence operation, manipulates and ultimately controls, with a separate Soviet dimension, the Islamic terrorist networks spun or iginally from the Muslim Brotherhood. This was established by the Abwehr in the Middle East during the 1920s in order to undermine British influence in the region - Al-Qaeda having been definitively identified as a manipulated instrument of the DVD. It will be shown in Chapter 8 that the Nazi Continuum has specifically stated, in a document captured by the Allies in the early 1950s, its intention of establishing the Thousand-Year Reich on the ruins of the United States. The German offensive against Britain is today concentrated ma inly in the EU entrapment mechanism. Although, given the focus of this book, th is Chapter addresses the scandal of US intelligence drug operations and collaboration w ith organised criminal elements, it is not to be assumed that the Author is unaware of the nefarious drug-peddling activities of the British, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Israeli, Chinese and probably the Swiss authorities. Cadres of French and German intelligence have been proliferating drug- trafficking operations, for decades. 'Clean' Briti sh intelligence sources advise that the Nazi apparat under Hitler, presided over by that evil genius Heinrich Himmler and the Abwehr, were well aware of the demoralising impact of drugs as a sabotage weapon. As Dr Joseph D. Douglass Jr. explains in his book Red Cocaine, the Soviet (and subsequent covert Soviet) drug-trafficking operations in the Western Hemi sphere were and are, to this very day, coordinated via the Americas Depa rtment of the Cuban Communist"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 81 Party, which is controlled by the Jesuit-educated intelligence officer, Fidel Castro, whose DGI intelligence service was always heavily penetrat ed and directed by KGB operatives. For many decades, French intelligence has used cocaine-trafficking proceeds to penetrate and sustain the US Democratic Party, while the Republican Party has been the beneficiary of heroin- related proceeds developed by German (DVD) in telligence assets. The identity of one such asset is exposed in this Chapter. Spanish 'Black' intelligence is devilishly criminalised, exploiting its Latin American connections, espe cially in Colombia, for drug-trafficking and covert blackmail and bankrolling purposes - with Spain today awash with drugs and allegedly used (until he was ordered out of Spain in June 2006) by George Bush Sr.'s Latin American drug-related deliveries into Europe on behalf of the DVD. Chinese intelligence were running drugs long before Mao Tse-Tung used drugs against his own people prior to 1949, after which he presided over the externalisation of Chinese Communist drug activ ities, with a regional focus. In the 19th century, British and American interests were, as noted in the preceding Chapter, involved in opium and general narcotics trading at the expense of Far Eastern Untermenschen. So the involvement of intelligence communities - which are primarily occultic secret societies - in criminal drug operations independently from and in collaboration with, self-standing organised cr iminal networks, has been the norm for perhaps two hundred years. A GREAT POWER MUST UNILATERALLY RENOUNCE DRUGS A senior US intelligence operative told the Author in 2005 that 'if you attack the drug operations, they will kill you'. He said this not in order to threaten, but to enlighten. To which the obvious answer is that no part of the known truth is eligible for suppression. Drug-related intelligence criminality perpetrated by so-called civilised nations is a Satanic aberration that reveals the criminal nature of the governments that permit such activities, even on the 'pragmatic' ground that 'everyone else is doing it, so we have no choice. There is no alternative'. Actually, there is: what a national government thus compromised has the option of doing is to voluntarily renounce, and to order all its structures to cease and desist from, all drug-related activity - on pain of the same severe penalties that are (or ought to be) served up to drug traffickers at every leve l. Those who will reply that 'the world is not like thaf (as one worldly-wise and deeply cynical US intelligence operative said to the Author in March 2005), need to look at themselves in the mirror, take stock, and repent - or they will indeed 'die in their sins'. However, this certainty does not seem to al arm them. For the evil people we are talking about are indoctrinated with the Nietschian nihilism expressed on the grim engraving upon the west wall of the Skull and Bones 'Tomb' on the Yale campus: 'Ob Arm, ob Reich, im Tode gleich'. For such people, death is 'the term inus': yet their demented occultic 'religion' impregnates them with the Luciferian lie that we live in a 'mechanistic world' and that they, as 'chosen ones', are privileged to be empowered (through ritualistic progression) to manipulate the opposing 'mechanistic forces' of 'good' and 'evil' (although they do not in fact believe in good and evil at all, notwithstanding that in their blinded eyes, 'Lucifer' is good and Jesus Christ (uniquely) is perceived to be the personification of evil, given that the Devil 'turns everything upside down'). And to 'compensate' them for the absence of any hope arising from their obeying the Evil One, these Luciferi an occultic Masonic nutcases have invented the ludicrous delusion of 'reincarnation'. So to 'hope' for any of the competing Great Powers to renounce the drug-trafficking operations of their criminalised intelligence communities will doubtless seem ridic-"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs ulous to any cynical intelligence officer who may have been ordered to read this book. Yet it is exposure that such people fear most: after all, senior US intelligence officials have boasted, and expressed pride in the fact that, they control the US media - which they do in order, of course, to minimise exposure. And such contro l of free speech feeds, necessarily, on itself: as the darkness descends, exposure of official criminality becomes less and less feasible, but never impossible to achieve (since the media's controlling intelligence cells can never be 100% certain that 'breakouts' will not occur). These people are 'los t: in whom the god of this world' (Lucifer, the Prince of this World) 'hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of th e glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them' [Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 4, verses 3-4]. Those, therefore, who are feared most, are those into whose souls this brilliant true light has indeed shined: for if, by accide nt, any such being s hould reach appropriate high office, he or she would be bound, if so empowered, to demand the immediate cessation of all drug-related operations by the penetrated authorities and their compromised structures, whatever the consequences. For governments that not only tolerate such activities, but participate in them, are criminal governments. DRUG OPS AND POLITICAL PAYOLA BY BRITISH INTELLIGENCE For the British political parties, the conseque nces of any cessation of official drug-related operations would be severe. In the 1950s and 1960s, the two main Brit ish political parties enjoyed paid-up memberships in excess of one million each. When the Labour Party (under the corrupted Harold Wilson) and C onservative Party (under the corrupted long- term German Abwehr agent, Edward Heath: see Chapter 8) embarked upon the treacherous course of 'taking Britain into Europe', both realised that the British electorate would be fundamentally antagonistic to the collectivisation and therefore the destruction of their ancient British sovereignty, that their memberships would decline, and that, accordingly, some other means of financing would become necessary. The means to hand was, and remains, drugs. In 1972, wh en the treasonous German agents Edward Heath and Geo ffrey Rippon signed the UK Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Commun ities, the number of heroin addicts was of the order of 30,000. The total number of heroin addicts today exceeds 300,000; and these people are supported by the (criminalised) National Heath Service, which provides them with methadone, cynically ensuring that their demand for heroin after 't reatmenf will continue. The collapse of political memberships has accel erated in recent years. In May 1997, when 13,517,911 British electors voted for the Labour Party, the symbol of which is the Rosicrucian Rose, it had 407,000 members; in May 2005, when 9,547,944 people voted for Labour, it had 200,000 members. A similar collapse of Conservative Party membership has occurred. Whereas funds for General Elections were successfully raised in the 1950s and part of the 1960s by local activists, the flow of funds from the 'grass roots' has to a considerable extent dried up, as cynicism, propelled by dissatisfaction and disgust at Britain's corrosive EU membership, has proliferated. Membership of the European Union, which, as will be explained later, is an operation of secret German long-range strategic intelligence, has been associated with the corruption of British politics - the EU and its structures being accustomed to and driven by German-style corruption on the grand scale [see Chapter 8]. Ac cordingly, with the penetration of MI6 and other elements of the British intelligence community, drug operations are now routinely deployed to bankroll the two main political parties (the Author had"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 83 no information at press date on the financing of the Liberal Democrats, although their limpet-like adherence to and support for the sterile policy of British membership of the Collective suggests that similar arrangem ents may apply). And the funds are made available by certain intelligence cadres, with large sums being transferred from offshore accounts, in exchange for sizeable rake-offs for the perpetrating 'benefactors' concerned. Specifically, MI6, under John Scarlett, is orie nted towards the German/French axis, with Scarlett, in particular, suspected of being an asset of Franco-German intelligence. In 2004 and early 2005, MI6 attempted to smear this Author, as he prepared to expose the giga- financial operation to finance the New Underworld Order presided over by George Bush Sr., in his financial journal International Currency Review. The Author, pre-warned of this intention by a veteran British journalist with deep MI6 contacts, proceeded to publish 16 pages of detailed information, in the journal, about how the intended smears were conveyed to him, ostensibly 'to make you sit up'. Followi ng this 'blow-back', the smearers appeared for a time to have ceased and desisted. Their clumsy libels against this Author consisted of allegations that the Author was somehow associated with Sir Mark Thatcher in connection with the aborted Equatorial Guinea fiasco (in which a group of mainly British investors / operatives were supposedly engage d in plotting to overthrow the dictatorial government of that oil-rich country). A second, equally farcical version had the Author engaged in some underhand transaction in Monaco with Bernie Ecclestone, the British motor racing king-pin, an alleged drug dealer who was involved in the notorious Great Train Robbery in the 1960s. Such absurd inventions, concocted inside the MI6 building, overlooked the well-known fact that the Author works 24/7, 365 days of the year on his business's books and serials, so that there would be no time for any such stupid ventures. The veteran British journalist who retailed the Mark Thatcher invention, Gordon Thomas, warned the Author that MI6 had obtained unspecified false information about the Author, which had been retailed to the British media. This outrag e was also reported in International Currency Review. In the light of the Author's knowledge that elements of MI6 are not only 'working with' German and French intelligence against Britain's interests, but that MI6 is in the habit of frustrating the work of honest MB operatives working round the clock against the Al- Qaeda cells ultimately controlled by German 'Black intelligence, one can see why MI6 stupidly dislikes the Author and all his works. That corrupted intelligence organisation will dislike him all the more for revealing, herewi th, that MI6 accommodates the GO-2 'anti-drug' cadre of UK intelligence community, at their Lambeth headquarters, and that GO-2, far from curbing drug-trafficking into Britain, actively en courages and facilitates it. Specifically, it coordinates two drug cartels which are the sources of corrupt drug finance made available to the main British political parties by its 'good offices'. After informing the Author of these dreadful facts, the reliable intelligence sources who provided this information, added in unison: 'Britain has a criminal government'. It is to be hoped that these necessary exposures will help any critics in the United States to understand that both our countries are victims and at the same time perpetrators of these unspeakable evils, so that this book's focus on the evils identified inside the US structures and society, must not be construed as being in any way indicative of bias on the part of the Author against the United States. Knowing how sensitive Americans are to criticism of any kind, this needed to be said, not least since the Author is a frequent visitor to the United States and a devoted fan of that great country. Indeed the Author's very familiarity with parts of America has,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"84 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs in part, motivated this investigation - wh ich has been assisted by the relative trans- parency of US society, and by tensions caused by foreign penetration inside US intelligence: the underlying source of leaks by para doxically dissident loyal US operatives. Keeping the main British political parties afloat and at times awash with drug money has of course irreparably corrupted the British political system, converting the genuine democracy that flourished up to the 1950s and 1960s into a the decadent crim- inalised cess-pit that we see before our eyes today. The reverse of the drug money coin is, of course, the familiar word : BLACKMAIL. Should a key political party, or elements within it, show signs of deviating from 'the agenda', GO-2 and MI6 have the means, shall we say, of ensuring that any such intended 'deviancy' is brought back 'on message' with minimal delay. In the unlikely event of a 'mishap', taking the form of some indiscreet politician persisting with deviations from 'the line', heavy hints or threats are issued concerning the dire consequences liable to attend any such departure. And what is the 'line' to which all the main UK political parties are required to adhere so rigidly? You guess right: no rocking of the European Union boat. No talk of Britain leaving the German-dominated European Union. And of which key country is the European Union a long-term foreign policy strategic extension and deception? Answer : Germany. The key political parties are paid for by drug money, coordinated by the DVD, Dachau. GERMANY EXPORTS ILLUMINISM AS ITS MAIN STRATEGIC COVER German intelligence has always influenced and been present deep within foreign targeted intelligence and policymaking circles - not least within the Soviet intelligence and Communist Party structures. The Illuminist Grigory Efimovich Rasputin-Novy was widely assumed by the Russian nobility to be a German subversion operative. As Edvard Radzinsky has explained in his book 'Rasputin: The Last Word' [Weidenfeld and Nicholson, and Phoenix, Orion Books Ltd., London, 2000, page 527]: 'At the time, they were already saying on every [street] corner and in every home that Rasputin was in the pay of German agents. And Rasputin, and the Tsarina who deferred to him, and [Anya] Vryubova [the Tsarina's closest friend] - the 'dark forces' - deci ded to lead Russia out of the war'. But that, indeed, was what Rasputin, who had been 'prepositioned' with the Imperial Family by German intelligence prior to the war, was instructed to do. It is, indeed, a speciality of German intelli gence to position operatives at the heart of targeted royalty. For instance, Mrs Wallis Simpson, a dark and sinister (as well as being an unsurprisingly ugly) woman, has been described to the Author by an intelligence source as a German agent, whose task had been to persuade King Edward VIII of the necessity of not impeding the Third Reich's plans in general, and remaining neutral in any war that might break out, in particular. And an incident in which Prince Harry, who once showed signs of excessively wild youthful behaviour, was photographed dressed up in a Nazi era uniform was, the Author is reliably informed, a typical discrediting operation masterminded by the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, which, like its Abwehr predecessor, has a long history of intermeddling with targeted European Royal Families. The fact that the British Royal Family is of partly German origin is not material, as the family and its national loyalties predate the hyperactivity phase of German Illuminism. Finally, Lavrentii Beria, Stalin's odious Uluminati secret police chief, was a long- serving German deep penetration agent. Whil e his (Jewish) boss, the Illuminist Josef Stalin (Djugashvili), was alive, Beria was acc ustomed to dining with the tyrant in the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 85 middle of the night (as Stalin, being 'of the darkness', preferred, like the occult Illuminist Hitler, to work at night: the daylight bothered him). Beria certainly maximised the potential for implementing Karl Marx's vow to procure the destruction of as much of humanity as possible. But as soon as Stalin was dead, Beria took it upon himself to travel to East Germany, with the intention of procuring the outcome that was finally orchestrated by Soviet military intelligence under Vladimir Putin in 1989-91, directed by KGB Supremo Gorbachev. As for the German Illuminist, Karl Marx, li kewise of Jewish extraction (but having had a Protestant upbringing), he abandoned his early Christian learning well before his twenties (as did Stalin, who had been a seminary student in his teens), and took to writing demonic poetry and plays. In his poem 'The Pale Maid en', Karl Marx wrote: Thus Heaven I've forfeited, I know it full well. My soul, once true to God, Is chosen for Hell'. This is uncannily close to the 'lyric' belted out by the Finnish Illuminati-controlled devil Lordi at the 51st Eurovision 'Song' Contest on 20th May 2006: 'Wings on my back, I got horns on my head, My fangs are sharp, and my eyes are red: Not quite an angel or the one that fell; Now choose to join us [the whole point - Ed.] or go straight to Hell'. As he became demon-possessed, having, lik e Lenin, Stalin and Hitler, indulged in occult activities, Marx's private writings became openly demonic. Marx was enticed into the occult while at University - just as 'tapped' Yale 'Bonesmen' are enticed into occultism by means of the intensified crash course in demo nic possession that they so eagerly embrace after being 'chosen'. Having proclaimed in one youthful outburst identified by the Romanian hero and Pastor, Richard Wurmbrand, who di scovered and examined Marx's poems, plays and other writings, and his letters to his father 1 , that 'Nothing but revenge is left to me', Marx spent the rest of his life, which he lived in unclean, dishevelled chaos, in pursuit of revenge against the Lord Almighty: 'I wish to avenge myself against the One who rules above', he wrote, thus revealing that, contrary to the common supposition, he was far from being an atheist. You can't take revenge against someone who doesn't exist. 'Embracing me', he wrote under demonic possession, 'the world will dumbly pass away, And then sink down to utter nothingness...'. And, having abandoned God, imagining he could spite the power that creates life, he dedicated his existence to turning truth upside down, which meant, as it means t oday, substituting death ('collateral damage') for life. Incredibly, too, Marx actually revealed, in an early poem, that he intended to 'go all the way' to becoming 'like a god' - the temptation elaborated at the beginning of the Book of Genesis, propelled by the 'seething energies of Lucifer' 2 : for in one screaming poem, he wrote, according to Pastor Wurmbrand's research: 'With disdain I will throw my gauntlet Full in the face of the world, And see the collapse of this pygmy giant [God] Whose fall will not stifle my ardour. Then I will wander godlike and victorious Through the ruins of the world And, giving my words an active for ce' [i.e., empowering them with the 'seething energy' derived from his 'familiar' spirit(s)], T will feel equal to the Creator' (even though Marx says that the Creator will have 'collapsed'). Such was, and remains to this day, the madness and demonic energy typical of members of the huge covert sect of the Illuminati, spawned originally from a Jesuit cradle in Germany. These are Tosf souls who consciously seek to outwit the prophesy of the greatest of all the Lord's prophets, Isaiah: 'How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!' (i.e., Lucifer weakens the nations, as we see so clear ly today). 'For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High' 3 ."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"86 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs The Soviet Government established by Tr otsky and Lenin was the first large-scale pitch-Black Illuminati-sponsored regime of the modern er a, despite having been for- mulated and directed mainly by operatives of Jewish extraction (for the Illuminati are neutral and agnostic about Jewishness, even th ough many are Jews: they use the Jews, and having made full use of their talents, discard them later, as necessary, while at the same time reserving the option of using them as scapegoats for their own open-ended criminality, as will be explained in Chapter 7 on the Illuminati. This is one of the most disturbing characteristics of what the Apostle Paul referred to as 'the mystery of iniquity' 4 . The second such modern Great Power Illuminist abomination was of course Nazi Germany. Following the fall of Hitler's regime - which the whole world mistakenly assumed 'meant' the collapse of Nazism - many similar abominations, modelled along Illuminist lines, sprang into existence: the Communist Chinese and Cambodian regimes and, most conspicuously today, the Illuminist regimes of North Ko rea, of Cuba and of Libya's Colonel Qadhaffi (who has surely one of the most evil of all recognisable faces) - and of the former Iraqi Ba'ath regime pr esided over by the Illuminist Saddam Hussein. That particular system was di rectly based upon th e Nazi model, being originally a cre ation of covert Nazi intelligence. Following the First World War, Hungary experienced a brief encounter with Illuminism, in the format of the murderous Bela Kun interlude. Without exception, the speciality of each of these abominations was mass slaughter. And the Illuminati 'black regime' model was developed in Germany. It now manifests itself most conspicuously in the United States, wher e a Nazi-style 'coup d'etat by instalments' is in progress 'as we speak', and swat teams with helmets similar to those worn by Nazi stormtroopers are sent in to stricken cities (like New Orleans) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency does nothing except belatedly deliver a consignment of 25,000 bodybags. Were these then filled with bo dies, or with drugs, as in Vietnam? ONGOING COVERT SOVIET CRIME AND DRUG-TRAFFICKING OPS Germany's covert orientation towards, and pe netration of, the Russian structures, did not cease with orchestrated, controlled, and typically Leninist 'collapsible Communism', although Vladimir Putin was reported in mid-2005 to be engaged in measures to purge his structures of German intelligence agents. That this reported purge was under way highlighted an issue left unresolved in this Author's first book \"The European Union Collective' - namely that the long-range double-headed 'enemy' of Britain and the United States (France/Germany-covert USSR), cannot re ly upon its own coherence, since these pow ers are all ambitious, ruthless, and divided against and among themselves. Of course, the covert Soviet strategic continuum has differe nt ideas about where this will all lead, from the long-range intentions of covert Nazi in telligence, with its focus on a German-domi nated 'Thousand-Year Reich' to be built on the ruins of the United States. Thus, in May 2002, the top Soviet Mlitary Intelligence (GRU) officer, Vl adimir Putin, addressing the new NATO-Russia Council, felt confident enough to tell the assembled leaders of NATO: 'We should call oursel ves the House of the Soviets'. Th e former Secretary-General of NATO, Lord Robertson, 'once' a Communist, who was in the Chair, responded by say ing: 'I will declare that to be a joke' - which, of course, it was not. On the contrary, Putin was deadly serious, and those present, includi ng President George W Bush, knew it. Yet even though President Bush Jr. was indeed present, the US President was quoted as par roting at another public venue, on 17th July 2002: 'Russia is no longer the enemy. Communism is dead'- the old, long since discredited mantra from the 1989-91 period."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 87 Given that the 'collapse of Communism' was orchestrated by Soviet intelligence, with extensive clandestine financial engineering assistance from the West, it follows that the Communist dimension of the World Revolution dialectic, including its drug-trafficking and organised criminal operations, have remained not just intact, but hugely invigorated by the predicted realisation that the West has remained fast asleep while this strategic deception proceeds in accordance with the Soviet revolutionary blueprint initially formulated by the Comintern in 1928 and upgraded after the death of Stalin. This was all explained in 'The Perestroika Deception' 5 , by the genuine Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, and is elaborated upon in successive issues of Soviet Analyst 6 , a publication edited by this Author. The Soviet (and now covert Soviet) Illuminist regime is 'stand-alone' in terms of its own revolutionary agenda, in accordance with th e routine geomasonic Illuminist discipline of the dialectic of mechanistic 'opposites'. Many reports have been published in 'Soviet Analyst' exposing dimensions of ongoing Soviet criminalist and drug intelligence activitie s, which are run in parallel with covert German, French and Spanish intelligence- coordinated drug-trafficking operations. Addendum 6 on page 695 ('Covert Soviet Financial Scams') is included specifically in order to emphasise the essential point that Soviet criminalism (= the exploitation by intelligence of organised criminal operations in the interest of strategy), which is State ('Revolution') policy, remains a hideous menace: it looks at Soviet intelligence criminalist penetration of the banking system, glimpses of which slipped into the public domain in the late 1990s in the context of the scandals surrounding the Soviet intelligence scams involving the embezzlement of $4.8 billion of IMF money, and Russian money-la undering operations via Bank of New York, Republic National Bank of New York, and innumerable offshore en tities, including FTMACO, based in Jersey, and various Cyprus-based offshore companies. Moscow's southern Cyprus-based money-laundering centre was established in the late 1980s by the son of Andrei Gromyko (Katz), the former long-serving Soviet Foreign Minister and briefly President, who suddenly vanished from his senior pos ition with the Soviet Academy of [Leninist] Sciences and surfaced in Cyprus, where as indicated he arranged for Cyprus to be used for Russian intelligence money-laundering purposes - residing in Limassol, close to the two British Sovereign areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. For a number of years, Gromyko Jr.'s telephone number (under his family name of Katz) could be found in the Limassol telephone directory. On 11th November 1999, the Bulgarian Ambassador to the United States, Philip Dimitrov, addressed a meeting in Washington, DC, attended by the Author. His theme was the progress of Bulgaria generally 'since the fa ll of Communism'. As soon as questions were invited, the Author asked the following question: 'Is the official firm KINTEX still in business, run by KGB officers and trafficking in drugs?' KINTEX is a large, notorious Bulgarian state- owned conglomerate, run as always by Bulgarian intelligence, which is allegedly involved in drug-trafficking (almost all corporations with the suffix 'ex' are KGB-related operations). Taken aback, the Bulgarian Ambassador blurted out that 'the KGB people who were running KINTEX have been cleaned out' [sic]. This was the first-ever official confirmation that KINTEX 'was' a KGB corporation. The response also confirmed, first-hand, the Bulgarian connection to the Uluminati's global-drug-traffick-ing operations. When the Author pressed home with the supplementary que stion 'Is KINTEX still involved in drug- trafficking?', Mr Dimitrov did not answer the question, but repeated, with some irritation, his earlier statement that 'the KGB people who were running KINTEX have been cleaned out'. He then stormed out of the meeting."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs As the Author argued in Soviet Analyst 7 , if the Bulgarian authorities had been genuinely interested in getting out of the global dr ug-trafficking business, why in that case keep KINTEX alive at all, since its alleged drug operations had been so widely publicised over the years? Why not at least change the entity 's name? Secondly who, exactly, 'cleans out' the KGB? No-one, of course, since the relabelled KGB is in the driving seat - in all States of the 'former' Soviet Bloc, as previously: in deed all East European and other Bloc States' intelligence services remain in the same subordinate relationship with Soviet intelligence as was the case prior to the applic ation (by the KGB and GRU) of the 'collapsible Communism' strategic deception in 1989-91. The same applies to their Interior Ministry structures. The false-flag, puppet 'non'-Communist Bulgarian Go vernment would never have been in any position to order Soviet KGB officers to leave KINTEX, especially since KINTEX 'was' so deeply involved in the implementation of Soviet global drugs strategy, which has the highest priority. Finally, the very fact that KINTEX has remained fully operative confirmed, without a shadow of doubt, that Mr Dimitrov was being 'economical with the truth': for, obviously, KINTEX has remained in the global drug bu siness, and under the control of the (relabelled) KGB, as before . Indeed, given the massive ongoing US intelligence drug-trafficking operations which will be discussed, there can never have been any question of 'former' Soviet Bloc drug- trafficking operations being mothballed or closed down. SOVIETS UNLEASH CRIMINAL CADR ES INTO WESTERN STRUCTURES In the 1990s, several prominent Russian of ficials (Communists masquerading as 'non'- Communists, as has by now become routine) made it evident that covert Soviet global revolutionary strategy entailed the unleashing of an army of Soviet criminal intelligence operatives into Western structures. For example, Boris Uvarov, functioning under the label of the Serious Crimes Investigator of the Russian Federation, made it crystal clear for the benefit of anyone lis- tening, that Western authorities had still, as late as the early 1990s, failed to realise what was about to hit them. According to the late Claire Sterling a CIA operative, author and pioneer of serious open investigations into the in teraction of the criminal underworld with intelligence communities and vice versa, Boris Uvarov, with typical Bolshevik 'candid arrogance', let the cat out of the bag when he pronounced: 'Naturally it's wonderful that the Iron Curtain is gone, but it was a shield for the West Now we've opened the gates, and this is very dangerous for the rest of the world. America is getting Russian criminals; Europe is getting Russian criminals. They'll steal everything. They'll occupy Europe. Nobody will have the resources to stop them. You people in the West don't know our mafiya yet. You will, you will' 8 . This offensive represented a primary dimension of Moscow's economic and financial warfare operations against th e West - the reverse of, or 'blowback', in opposition or response to, the extensive financial and ec onomic warfare offensives being waged by Western (especially British and American) inte lligence specialists against the Soviets and their fake 'non'-Communist successors in 1989-92. Some of the US Financial Warfare operations against the 'former' Soviet Union, including the removal of about 2,000 tonnes of official gold from the vaults of the Soviet Central Bank (Gosbank) and the degradation of the rouble, were masterminded by the heroic a nd unjustly treated US Secret Service/CIA/FBI intelligence officer Leo Wanta, whose subsequent exposure of criminal demands by US Presidents resulted in his illegal incarceration and house arrest."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 89 In his excellent book 'Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has invaded America' [Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2000, page xv], Robert I. Friedman noted that 'the FBI has described [Vyacheslav Kirillovich] Ivankov as the most powerful Russian mobster in the United States. Before coming to the U.S. in 1992, he spent many years in the GULAG for a number of gruesome crimes, including torturing his extortion victims, and he had personally ordered the killing of so many journalists, police and civilians in Russia that a ruling council of mob bosses banished him to America. He arrived with several hundred no-neck thugs led by a former KGB colonel'. According to other sources, at least 17,500 Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) operatives were embedded in the United States and its structures by the mid-1990s - an unconscionable state of affairs which is all the more disconcerting given that the continuing Soviet GRU controls and supervises the Soviet element of the drug offensive against the United States and the West. For, naturally, the United States is far from the only key Western country to have been targeted by covert Soviet (Russian) intelligence criminalists. The consequences of drug operations in Britain by intelligence criminalists have predictably proved absolutely disastrous, and the British Government has consistently covered up the scale of its compre hensive failure in the so-called 'war against drugs', exactly as has consistently been th e case in the United States. Whereas we know, and the Author documents in this Chapter, that German-linked elements of the vast US intelligence community are up to their necks in drug-trafficking, and have been so engaged for decades, the British tradition of official secrecy has hitherto prevented the exposure of any British intelligence involvement in this Luciferian activity. This can only mean one of two things: either British intelligence has been able to hide its complicity much more successfully than the leaky US intelligence community, which is riven by internal strife and rivalries; or else the British intelligence authorities have rightly refrained from participating in this evil game. The first alternative is correct: GO-2, a British 'Black' intelligence agency within MI6, not only cont rols two drug cartels and enables the proceeds to be deployed to finance the degraded political system, but also feeds cocaine into British schools. In late August 2002, officers from the (overt) Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution told the German newspaper 'Die Welt' 9 that Russian crime syndicates operating in Germany had close links to the Russian intelligence structures and also with 'high-ranking officials from politics and industry in Russia'. According to the German newspaper, in the past, German law enforcement o fficials had suspected that only former intelligence agents were involved with Russia n organised crime groups. But 'today', the report affirmed, they had evidence that active duty officers were involved. According to unnamed Bavarian officials: 'Often extremely flexible, interlinked businesses serving primarily money-laundering purposes have been established, commissioned by Russian intelligence services and criminal organisations'. The funds earned from these criminal activities flowed mainly into real estate, restaurants and hotels. Endeavouring to reconstruct the various sophisticated criminal transactions, the investigators complained that 'through the purposeful establishment of global links of firms and accounts, the fl ow-of-funds frequently can hardly be recon- structed', according to one literal translation from the German. The overt German security service confirmed separately that Russian or ganised crime operatives are 'cooperating with' Russian intelligence officers in criminal businesses engaged in human trafficking, money- laundering and illegal immigration scams. It made no mention of the massive heroin- trafficking conducted by the covert Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Thanks to compartmentalisation, which is as prevalent inside German intelligence as within the vast US intelligence community, it is possible that the overt officials concerned were unaware of DVD's dug operations. Whatever the truth of the matter, this German leap towards understanding was extremely be lated. What on earth prevented German officials from making the connection earlier? The answer was revealed in the report itself: They thought, or purported to believe, that the criminals in question were 'former' Russian intelligence officers, who had resorted to crime - whereas of course they were and remain intelligence officers who were rede ployed, along with criminal cadres released from the Soviet GULAG, specifically to realise the full potential of criminalism, in the interests of ongoing Soviet su bversion and sabo tage strategy. Why did they make that false assumption? Firs t, because the overt German intelligence and Jaw enforcement communities may, as indicated, work apart from the long-range strategists working inside the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst at Dachau, even tho ugh the DVD also has its officers penetrated deep inside the overt German Bundes Nachrichtendienst (BND) service (just as GO-2 sits inside MI6); and operatives and police cadres in the open stru ctures do not 'think dialectically'. And secondly, because of course they had fallen for the early lie that, following the Soviet 'August coup' provocation in 1991, the so-called 'purge' of the Soviet secu rity services undertak en by Vadim Bakatin that year, was genuine - so that, therefor e, hundreds of thousands of 'former' KGB operatives had been 'thrown out of work' and ha d resorted to crime as a means of survival. By jumping, along with their comparably deluded colleagues in other Western intelligence, or at least, policymaking, comm unities, to this lamentably false and naive conclusion, they found themselv es well-primed to absorb the easily-transferred lie that the organised crime activities in which these ' out-of-work' intelligence officers were i nvolved, were 'stand-alone' opera tions - like the US mafia-type activities familiar to Western movie audiences (even though the Chicago mafia has been used for decades by US intelligence to carrying out 'dirty work' operations, such as 'liquidations'). On 25th April 2005, 14 notorious Chicago mafi a gangsters - including such criminals as Joseph (the Clown) Lombardo, Frank (the German) Schweihs, Frank (Gumba) Saladino, and other professional 'old mafia' criminals and murderers, reputed for decades to have been the city's key orga nised crime gangsters, and most of whom should have been arrested years and decades ago - were sudde nly rounded up by the Chicago Police Department. The Un ited States Attorn ey, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, announced the indictment of the 14 reputed mobsters and their associates on charges of plotting and executing 18 murders as far back as 1970. So why on earth were these criminals left alon e for up to 35 years, to get on with their filthy activities? Several of the accused are now in their mid-70s. The late respected analyst Sherman Skolnick, who knew the local scene we ll, has advised that a longstanding 'nexus' between the local Chicago CIA station chief, the local FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and other components of the corrupt US Fe deral bureaucracy in Chicago were in the routine habit of employing the services of the Chicago Mafia, known as 'the boys', to perform the US Federal Government's dir tiest jobs, such as domestic political assassinations 0ohn and Robert Kennedy) and foreign 'liquidations' in Mexico and Central and South America, to order - together with operations to import drugs into the United States, penetration of foreign gove rnments through dope trafficking, fl ooding foreign jurisdictions with counterfeit paper money, smuggling high-tech weapons and gold, and manipulating the mass media through blackmail and other"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 91 practices. He further advised that this 'old-style' Mafia 'Establishment', having become sclerotic and set in its ways, had come to stand in the way of the Federal authorities' pre- ferred alternative underworld structure in Chicago - name ly the highly-disciplined, experienced Russian mafiya cadres who have taken over the local underworld, many of whom are KGB and Soviet Spetsnaz operatives. He informed the Author and others that 'the US Gestapo' now prefers to delegate its dirty work to these ultra-efficient, professionally trained Soviet criminal classes. The informant added that there are good reasons to believe that the vast Chicago Russian mafiya, operating with impunity, consists, in part, of renegade Mossad and Jesuit cadres 10 . CRIMINALISATION OF CAPITALISM PREDICTED BY CLAIRE STERLING This horrendous state of affairs was explicitly anticipated by Claire Sterling, following investigations which she described in her classic work 'Thieves' World'. In the course of a telephone conversation with a known US intelli gence operative in 2004, a friend of your correspondent mentioned that two copies of 'Thi eves' World' had been acquired, one for this Author and one for his friend. 'Oh', said the operative, 'I thought we had bought them all up' - by which he meant that a systematic attempt had been made to buy up or remove all copies of 'Thieves' World' [see Figure 23 below] from the open marketplace. Armed with this information, the Author was of course pre-advised as to the singular importance of the intelligence contained in this work which is the classic source for early information on the financial, economic and criminal warfare dimensions of the red- FROM 'THIEVES' WORLD' By Claire Sterling Simon & Schuster, New York, 1994, ISBN 0-671-74997-8 'Far from the commonplace affair it may seem, laun- dering crime money can be an intoxicating power game.

Among the notable insights from this classic work, are the following: 'Describing the [criminalism] scene in the summer of 1992, Deputy Chief Anatoliy Trechov of Moscow's Interpol declared: 'Less th an half of our joint ventures work. Only a quarter deal with their declared activities. Two or three out of five are financed with money of dubious origin. Many joint vent ures are fictitious. Often they're one-man operations to swing hard currency deals. Four thousand of them have rights of access to the foreign market. At least 500 of our mafiya groups use them to link up with international crime - in the United States, Italy, Germany, Austria, France, Canada, Poland'. Six months later, Boris Yeltsin himself adjusted this last estimate upwards. 'At least a thousand Mafiya groups have contacts with international organised crime', he said. 'The American and Sicilian Mafias' (Claire's code for US intellig ence) 'were the first in, by way of what was arguably the biggest black market currency swap ever perpetrated. As they and others moved in deeper, their Russian confederates moved out farther'. In other words, (a) 'collapsible Communism', a long-planned Soviet Leninist strategic intelligence deception, was orchestrated and lubr icated, in part, by means of intelligence interaction with the Soviet and Western intelligence underwor lds; and (b) the interaction of US and Western criminalised or underworld-linked intelligence operatives with Soviet criminal intelligence experts, flung the door wide open for the mass walk-in of Soviet intelligence criminalism experts that has si nce taken place - so that 'collapsible Communism' is being followed by the engineered collapse of capitalism. Enemy objectives include seizing control of the Western financial system - via its engine room, the banking networks - to compromise capitalism irretrievably, to milk the system for their own World Revolution objectiv es, to enrich themselves in the process, and to integrate the consequently criminalised Western financial entities with their own criminalised structures, so as to consolidate monopoly control. To the extent that Western and US intelligence understands belatedly what has happened, and what its own operations facilitated, the defeatist rationale that prevails today is that things have gone so far that 'we have no choice but to compete an d to wage secret intelligence warfare on their terms'. In other words, the secret global intelligence war has acquired the characteristics of its model - Mafia gang warfare. MAXIMISING THE POTENTIAL OF SOVIET INTELLIGENCE CRIMINALISM As a consequence, the covert Soviet intelli gence criminalism offensive has indeed been empowered (due mainly to irresponsible components of the US intelligence structures) to maximise the potential of unfettered crimin al and drug-traffickin g operations, protected by its detailed knowledge of endless parallel US criminal intelligence activities. Put another way, the US intelligence and policymaking communities are paralysed by the fact that, since the German element of US intellige nce is itself so deep ly compromised through its underworld and drug-running operations, th ey lack all moral authority - so that US operations to contain the spread and depred ations of Soviet criminalism have been neutralised by their own ill-advised and reckl ess criminalism behaviour. It is also the case that since of course Soviet intelligence has made it its business to stay well informed, in real time, about US intelligence criminalism operations, it regards any protests and opposition from the West about its cr ime offensive with cynical derision. By descending into the sewer with Russian criminal oper atives, the United States' German-influenced intelligence services have smothered themselves in the same filth as"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 93 their Soviet counterparts. All sewer rats are brown: there are no distinctions. By merging intelligence operations with the domestic and Soviet underworlds, US intelligence has, over the years and especially since the 'change s' of 1989-91, laid itself wide open to compromise, blackmail and consequent further deep penetration by foreign intelligence - under the guise of 'cooperation' both above and below the radar. And covert Soviet intelligence is of course only too well aware of the criminal histories of prominent past and present Illuminati operatives in the US politi cal firmament who are protected inter alia by the US Secret Service, and by their intelligence covers and their high offices, from the consequences of any exposures of their serially criminal activities (so far). Russian organised criminal operations at home and abroad are not independent at all: they are controlled and run by the intelligence services, under cover of the basic illusion summarised above. Vadim Victorovich Bakatin, who supervised the 'reorganisation' of Soviet intelligence after the 'collapse', earned the Order of Lenin from Gorbachev in 1987. In late December 1999, the Financial Times of London carried reports elaborating on earlier leaks from US authorities to the effect that Russian [GRU-linked] 'organised crime figures' had been contributing to the campaign funds of prominent US politicians. In fact, what has been happening is that both Chinese and Russian elements have been 'competing' to make contributions (Chinese intelligence cadres being heavily involved in drug- trafficking as well, both in competition with, and in collaboration with (as necessary) their Soviet and American intelligence competitors/collaborators). The tactical purpose of such contributions is that, prior to exposure, the politi cian concerned (the victim) is susceptible to the underlying threat of blackmail; while after exposure, he or she is liable to be discredited: in this way, the electoral prospects of candidates favoured by the dialectical Left can be enhanced at the expense of 'unreliable' candidates. For instance, the former Republican Mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, was allegedly identified from 1993 and 1997 election records as a recipient of funds ($46,250) from family members and businesses linked to Semyon (Sam) Kislin - named in a 1994 internal report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] as a Russian KGB crime syndicate member. Kislin also helped to organise fund-raising events yielding millions of dollars for Mr Giuliani's campaigns, including a once expected bid for the US Senate. The Russian commodities trader further donated $8,000 to the campaigns of the New York Senator, Charles Schumer, a Democrat, wh ile also contributing to the campaigns of several other political figures all across the political spectrum, including the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, and Republican Senator Alfonse d'Amato. Kislin even sat on the New York City Economic Development Board. Likewise, Jacob Bogatin, an associate of the Russian KGB/GRU operative Semyon Mogilevich - identified by both US and British intelligence as the head of a Russian crime syndicate - made donations to the US National Republican Congressional Committees in 1996-98. An Interpol report dating from 1996 claimed that Kislin's firm, Trans Commod ities Inc., was used by two 'reputed mobsters' from Uzbekistan, Lev and Mikhail Chernoy, for fraud and embezzlement purposes. An FBI intelligence report dating from 1994 on the Brooklyn-based Mafia organisation headed by Vyacheslav Ivankov [see page 89], the imprisoned godfather of Russian organised crime in the United States, listed Kislin as a 'member/associate' of Ivankov's gang - claiming that his company co-sponsored a Russian GRU-criminalist boss and contract killer for a US visa, and asserting that he was a 'close associate' of a notorious GRU-linked arms smuggling operative, Babeck Seroush, an Iranian 'hoodlum' who later settled in Russia."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"94 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs One interesting point here was that Seroush was indicted in 1984 by Rudolph Giuliani, who was then the US Attorney fo r the Southern District of New York, on charges of conspiring to smuggle semiconduc tors and night-vision goggles to North Korea. But West Germany, where he was living - protected by DVD - declined to extradite him to the United States. Mr Seroush was an Iranian-born 'Communist' who first moved to the Soviet Union in the 1970s and specia lised in smuggling high-tech military equipment for the Red Army. He also has a record of drug-smuggling. According to the FBI and Interpol, 'an intelligence firm called Trans Comm odities Inc. laundered millions of dollars and was used for fraudulent banking documents by the Chernoys in the ear ly 1990s, with the brothers 'engineering' the takeover of much of Russia's metals industry, notably aluminium, through alleged embezzlement, money launderi ng and murder. The FBI report claims that in the early 1990s, Mikhail Chernoy was 'doing business as Transcommodities (sic), a New York-based trading company which is known to have laundered millions of dollars from Russia to New York'. Further, a 1996 Interpol report based on several continuing investigations of the Chernoys, claimed that Blonde Management, controlled by the Chernoy brothers, is 'a money-laundering company target of US law enforcement'. The Uzbeki Chernoys were said now to be Israeli citizens and were 'suspected of money laundering, embezzlement of funds, and contract killing', according to Interpol. The Russian authorities revealed separatel y to the FBI that the Chernoys reportedly 'defrauded' the Russian Central Bank of more than $100 million through an elaborate scam involving dozens of fictitious companies. The brothers then used the funds as seed money as they and a London-based holding company, Trans World Group, rapidly gained control, through a maze of offshore compani es and alliances, of Russia's aluminium industry, while acquiring a large stake in the processing and distribution of other metals and petroleum products. This , at least, is the received, inadequate, san itised, Western official interpretation of these particular matters. All such 'snapshots', by definition, omit details of parallel and connected operations on bo th sides - that is to say, on the part of criminalism cadres within the corrupt Sovi et structures who were collaborating and continue to collaborate with their Israeli, Western and US counterparts in similar scams. Strategic analysis illuminates matters further. The initial funds were of course made available by the Russian Central Bank for use by these KGB/GRU officers to establish 'state-controlled capitalism'/criminalist structures. BIZARRE AND RUTHLESS TREATMENT OF OPERATIVES It is standard practice for Soviet intelligence (a s well as for US intelligence) to leave operatives who 'mess up', to dangle in the wind, after exposure, only to be rehabilitated (often with a new ID) later, once the relevant publicity has di ed down (or not, as the case may be). In the covert Soviet Union, the most conspicuous victim of this prac tice in recent years has been Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a minor Minister in th e late Gorbachev Government, senior KGB officer, and founder of the European Union Bank in Anguilla, identified not only as a KGB money-laundering entity but also as a 'bank' used by the German-American sometime CIA Director of Operations, a Mr Edward Lyle Bryan (Goeringer): see Addendum 7 on page 701 for details. In the US context, the FB I spy, Robert Hanssen, labelled when he was convicted on 6th July 2001 after pleading guilty to 15 counts of espionage, as the spy who did more damage to US national security than anyone in history, was reported to have been incarcerated in an underground cell at the vast"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 95 intelligence and solitary confinement complex in Denver, with no natural light and only a computer for companionship. It was said that he would be serving life, having cooperated with the authorities in exchange for them not asking for the death penalty. Yet in June 2005, the Author was authoritatively informed by an impeccable US intelligence source that Hanssen was a free man, living on the West Coast. 'Mike' Delmart Vreeland, an operative w ho predicted the 9/11 attacks from a prison cell in Toronto, and who was said by a high-level US Pentagon intelligence officer to be 'no longer a threat to you' (this Author) 'because he is in solitary confinement for a very long time, and his case is sealed', was reported (a) to have been released from incarceration, again in June 2005, after serving no more than si x months of such 'punishment', and having probably been held for his own protection, in view of the sensitive operations in which he had been involved; while (b) he was simulta neously reported to be still in solitary confinement (which remained th e case as of June 2006). The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) operative identified the Iraqi connection with Al-Qaeda, bringing back from an operation in Moscow the text of a message from Uday Hussein to President Putin dated June 2000, in which the precise date and targets of the 9/11 events were identified [see Figure 24, page 97]. This text has be en criticised as a possible forgery, in which case it would have been designed to deflect attention away from the actual controllers of Al-Qaeda, and the inspiration behind the Iraqi Ba'athists, namely Deutsche Verteidigung s Dienst, Dachau. The Illuminati's controllers reserve the right ultimately either to rescue and protect their own operatives, or else to treat them with ruthless harshness. In sensitive cases, operatives who, according to the rule that protection may be afforded them in hospital or jail, ought to have been liberated long ago, may be jailed, 'for their own protection', for many years, or held under house arrest. Abandonment by their handlers and intellig ence communities is th e risk that such operatives are required by their CIA or their KGB/GRU superiors to accept, as part of their job description. Those Soviet operatives who were to be come 'oligarchs' accepted the poisoned chalice in the format of an opportunity to 'become billionaires overnighf -which was the offer made by Soviet intelligence at the outset of the orchestrated 'changes' in the late 1980s under the KGB strategic intelligence chief, Mikhail Gorbachev. THE OLIGARCHS: KGB/GRU OPERAT IVES FAKING 'FREE ENTERPRISE' Specifically, the intelligence officers who subse quently emerged as 'oligarchs' - such as Vagit Y. Alekperov, Pyetr O. Aven, Boris Berezovs ky, Mikhail M. Fridman (Friedman), Andrei I. Kazmin, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Vladimir O. Potanin, Aleksandr P. Smolensky, Vladimir P. Vinogradov, Rem Vyakhirev, Anatoliy Chubais, Vladimir Wolfovich Zhiri novsky, and a few years later (in 2004) Roman Abramovich - were 'tapped' by their GRU and KGB intelligence superiors and asked whether they would like to wake up the next morning as billionaires, it being implied that their talents suited them for the task - on the unspoken (or perhaps formal) understanding that, as happened in the 1 930s, the Party-State would in due course require the assets, which were to be privatised into their hands, to be handed back with compound interest 11 . When some of them, such as the mentioned KGB operative/politician Mikhail Khodorkovsky, were judged to have become too powerful or arrogant, or had embezzled too much, President Putin (who was himself still 'owed' $30 billion of 'special' funds from US secret intelligence sources in 2006) de manded that they dis gorge their assets, or, in this case, arrested the operative concer ned and held him sine die in jail. This"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs massive operation, in which the 'assets of the Party-State were 'privatised' into the hands of selected KGB/GRU officers, was implemented in order to convince the naive international institutions, governments and poli cymakers blinded by the dazzling 'success' of orchestrated 'collapsible Communism', that the 'changes in the Soviet Union (and Bloc) were for real, and that the 'former' Communists had embraced 'capitalism' - whereas, in reality, these manoeuvres represented an elabor ate Leninist strategic ruse, assisted by Western 'Financial Warfare' intelligence, ca lled 'State-controlled capitalism': a more sophisticated variation of Lenin's New Economic Policy 'state capitalism' of the 1920s, which Stalin closed down within the spa ce of three weeks in the following decade. Interestingly, three weeks was the precise length of time that Mikhail Gorbachev took to close down - for international public cons umption only - the 'Stalinist model' of Communism, in August and September 1991. According to The Washington Post 12 , President Putin launched his in telligence operation to claw back the 'assets of the Party- State' that had been 'privatised' into the hands of these selected KGB/GRU 'oligarchs', at a round table meeting of 21 such KGB/GRU 'olig archs' held in Moscow in July 2000. Addressing the meeting in his familiar Aesopian surreal Bolshevik method of speaking Putin warned: 'I only want to draw your attention to the fact that you have yourselves formed this very state, to a large extent through political and quas i-political structures under your control. So perhaps what one should do least of all is blame the mirror'. Given that compartmentalisation also exis ts within the Soviet intelligence services, although not to the extreme extent that bedev ils US intelligence, Putin was informing the highly intelligent, specially selected, largely Jewish crimina list KGB crooks concerned that he was perfectly well aware that they were intelligence operatives who had exploited their control of overt political and covert (= 'quasi-political') structures, to leverage the colossal wealth that they had accumulated - and (unspoke n) that the assets that they controlled as a consequence of their criminalist intelligence operations belonged ultimately to the State (which would in due course be requiring restitution and disgorgement with all the interest due to it), as occurred when Stalin set the precedent in the 1930s. In the modern era, the main initial wave of Soviet criminalist specialists arrived in the West during the mini-perestroika years under Leonid Brezhnev, in the early 1970s. In 'Red Mafiya', Robert I Friedman pointed out that 'in America, Miami had become the Russian mob's second city. Like Brighton Beach, it had a large Russian immigrant population. In the early 1970s, the Miami Beach Po lice Department began to notice that an inordinate number of Russian emigre taxi drivers were committi ng criminal acts. These Russians didn't fit the cops' preconceived notion of crooks, however. \"They were always neatly dressed and very clean-cut and gave the appearance of want ing to fit in and learn the American way of life\", said a Federal law enforcement report, written in Figure 24, opposite, top (1): The text of a letter from Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein's eldest son, to Vladimir Putin, dated 9th June 2000, predicting the 9/11 attacks, which the US intelligence officer 'Mike' Delmart Vreeland obtained in Moscow and was assigned to courier along with three diplomatic bags, to Canadian intelligence, but which he copied after sensing that something was about to go awry after he had landed at Toronto Airport. There, instead of being met by Canadian intelligence, he was approached by Russians. He handed over dummy diplomatic bags and kept a copy of this Note, which some have tried to dismiss as a forgery. It specifically confirms Iraqi complicity in the 9/11 attacks, implying Soviet involvement - thereby masking the reality that Al-Qaeda is controlled by DVD, Dachau, i.e. German involvement. Figure 24, opposite, lower image (2): Vreeland's 'Prison Note' scribbled ostensibly in the dark, on the floor of a Toronto prison cell. The Note was dated August 2001, and contained the phrase: 'They will paint me crazy and call me a liar... Let one happen stop the rest!!!'. After 9/11, the sleepy Canadian authorities woke up to the significance of this Note and passed it to their US counterparts. The Note also contains the intriguing observation: 'No comments on Lehder', a reference to the German (Colombian) DVD ope rative who masterminded the establishment of drug- trafficking cartels for criminalised US intelligence: see page 151 et seq."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 97 "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs 1994. Gradually, the Miami police learned that these taxi drivers were involved in many of the same crimes that had made the Italian Mafia so powerful: extortion, narcotics, gambling and prostitution. \"They were a very tight group of criminals who had a code of silence that even the threat of arre st could not break\", the report added' 13 . 'By the late 1980s, the Miami Beach Polic e noted that crimes involving Russian criminals were growing craftier; their schemes more involved - well-organized narcotics trafficking, burglary and counterfeiting rings, and sophisticated bank and jewellery frauds. Even as the Russian mobsters graduated to white-collar crime, a continuing influx of Russians allowed them to control the streets, \"R USSIAN O RGANIZED C RIME IS A NEW AND SERIOUS THREAT TO S OUTH F LORIDA \", warned a 1994 report. \"This is a well-educated group of active, young criminals' - specially trained in criminalism by Soviet intelligence, which has presided over a mass exodus of KGB and GRU operatives who have long since become embedded all over the United States, in univ ersities, government, software (especially), business operations, and functioning as drivers, r estaurateurs, you name it. In addition to Miami Beach and Brighton B each, Brooklyn is now flooded with Russians, Chin ese and other immigrants, who have been buying up property, pushing the local tradesmen out of business, establishing ethnic diners all over the place, and generally asserting their ownership. The Russian 'taxi driver phenomenon' has also been reported throughout the country. And in June 2005, New York real estate agents were being swamped with money from Russia and other 'former' Soviet Bloc countries. Funds for the purchase of New York apartments were being wired to them, sight unseen, on the basis of the brochure alone. Of course the invasion of Soviet crimina list operatives, while most noticeable in the United States, has proliferated in Europe, too, leveraging the potential associated with the corruption of elements of the German, French, Spanish, Dutch and British intelligence communities, and of the European Union struct ures, which are institutionally corrupt. On 18th June 2005, Spanish police arrested 28 alleged Mafia bosses fr om 'former' Soviet Republics in 11 cities and resort towns in Alicante, Catalonia and the Costa del Sol, in what was described as the largest swoop on organised cr ime in European history. In this sting, called Operation Wasp, police froze 800 bank acco unts, searched 41 estates and businesses, and confiscated 42 Porsches, Ja guars and other luxury cars. Some €400,000 in cash and cheques were seized, along with guns, jewellery and properties, including a small mansion in Barcelona. Most of the capos were reportedly from Georgia, a traditional centre of criminal oper ations in Soviet times and for generations previously. They laundered money from illegal activities in their home countries and abroad, 'through a vast and expanding network of properties, restaurant chains and bars along the Spanish coast. They were charged with money laundering, bankruptcy fraud and maintaining ties to organised crime' 14 . Spain, at the crossroads between Europe an d Africa, is also the main entry point for drugs and money from the Latin American cartels, which as this Chapter will show are far from being 'stand-alone' operations, but are controlled by foreign intelligence. The mentioned swoop was one of several large- scale police operations against international drug trafficking, prostitution and money-launde ring rings on the Spanish coast, as the local authorities struggle to prevent Spain from 'becoming another Colombia' -the image that they have in mind. At the beginning of the same month, Spanish, Portuguese and British police found nearly five tonnes of cocaine worth an estimated £225 million at street level aboard a trawler off the Spanish coast, arresting 11 people,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 99 including three Britons. In March 2005, another laundering ring was broken up by simul- taneous raids. The size of the law enforcement hauls has been increasing. Reports such as these indicate that some European police forces are becoming more effective and appropriately ruthless in disc overing and apprehending perpetrators of the absolutely heinous crime of drug-trafficking, which cynically wrecks the lives of millions of foolish and vulnerable people, and of innocen t and impressionable children. A colossal industrial structure has been established to fac ilitate distribution of the drugs: for instance, on the very same weekend that the massive swoop that has been described took place, The Guardian', one of the British newspapers that gave the sting most coverage, was simultaneously sponsoring the annual 'pop music' festival at the ancient occult site at Glastonbury. This is timed every year as close as possible to the summer solstice, which is one of the primary dates of the occult calendar. The drug distribution infrastructure exploits such events to maximise the distribution of their product, the consumption of which goes hand in hand with 'enjoyment' of diabolical 'm usic' (noise) and dabbling in the occult. Indeed the proliferation of drugs, which is a project of the Illuminati as will be elaborated later, and the subculture they encourage, has been a carefully calculated prerequisite for the explosion of interest and dabbling in the occult 15 . EVERYONE IS IN ON THE ACT: SO 'ANYTHING GOES' IN THIS HELL The rampant activities of 'former' Soviet Bloc drug operatives, mist aken in the West as manifestations of a 'stand-alone' 'ex'-Soviet Mafiya - whereas in real ity these people are all connected with and supervised by the ongoing covert Soviet intelligence services -have proliferated most of all because Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU), which directs the Soviet dimension of the drug offensive because it is considered a weapon of war and sabotage, is fully aware of the fact that US intelligence has been engaged in drug-trafficking on a massive scale for decades, driven originally by German penetration of the CIA. Naturally, the Soviet attitude is that counterdrug operations against Soviet intelligence criminalists can never achieve decisive success while the Central Intelligence Agency continues with its own cynical money-making operations from the drug trade. Although close lay observers have known for many years about this scandalous state of affairs, the intelligence services have been adept at keep ing the lid on this prospectively explosive scandal - and have more incentive for doing so than ever, given that everyone is in on the act. Drug-trafficking, holding financial assets in secret numbered offshore accounts, and ignoring the tax and reporting regulations imposed by metropolitan authorities, is 'acceptable' in this Thieves' World, a.k.a. the New Underworld Order. For instance, as the distinguished drugs expert Rachel Ehrenfeld has pointed out 16 , George Bush Sr., a top CIA operative of course, took immediate steps to provide himself and the CIA with what he thought would be appropriately dense cover. 'To be sure, he did not wait long to announce his own views on drugs' - the problem being that the views he announced were false, and were not his real views. Those were formulated during his Senior Year at Yale, as an occult adept of Skull and Bones, and in the context of his German intelligence connections and orientation. 'I n his inaugural address, the new President made clear [that] the fight would be a priority. Bush's early ap pointment of William Bennett and his orders to the drug czar to produce a plan within six months were' not 'steps in the right direction', as Rachel politely suggested, but rather measures to provide cover for the continuing scandal of rampaging drug operations in which the CIA remained involved. Unfortunately, Ms. Ehrenfeld allowed her"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"100 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs optimism to gain the upper hand, insofar as the US Government's true intentions were concerned. Nor did she disti nguish between the probably honourable intentions of the various US anti-drug structures, and the notoriously ev il intentions and practices of ele- ments of the penetrated US intelligence se rvices, which is the most depressing and alarming feature of the crisis the world faces. Obviously, if 'the main enemy's' intelligence services are engaged in global dr ug-trafficking, all expressions of concern at the Soviet drugs offensive against the West, such as those elaborated by Dr Douglass in 'Red Cocaine', were bound to be jeopardised. Fo r, before the United States can ever hope to stem and counter the flood of Soviet-, French-, Ge rman-, Mexican- and Spanish-provenanced drugs, and the corruption and money-laundering flows associated with them, its own filthy house will need to be put in order. An d since the intelligence services run and control the Government, what chance is there ever of that happening? 17 The Central Intelligence Agency has controlled and accumulated colossal stocks of 'Black Operations' funds ever since Presiden t Harry Truman signed the National Security Act in 1947, which, with its amendments and successor legislation, has created a 'cr ooks' charter' environment - separating the intell igence community from the rest of the US Government, given its command of vast resources that Congress knows nothing about. The first lay analyst to come to grips with this was Jeffrey Robinson, in his excellent book 'The Laundrymen', first published in 1994 18 . 'Right from the beginning', wrote Robinson, 'the Agency's more consequential role would be 'covert'. Officially included in that category have always been: subsidies to individuals; financial support and 'technical assistance' to political parries; support of private organizations, which includes labour unions, business companies, cooperatives, an d so forth; economic operations' (meaning financial and economic warfare); and 'para-military or political actions designed either to overthrow or support a regime'. Mr Robinson acknowledged extensive assistance from the Customs Attache at the US Embassy in London, John Hurley, and many offici als from the US Department of Justice, US Customs, the Federal Bureeau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Office of the District Attorney for New York County, as well as (in Britain) from HM Customs, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), and the Metropolitan Police; and from the relevant Canadian, Australian and European law enforcement and financial regulation authorities. 'As the CIA could never finance any of these things publicly... they operated their own laundry. The Director' (of Central Intelligence) 'maintains a top-secret slush fund - a huge pile of invisible money that Congres s knows nothing about - for which he's accountable directly, and only, to the President'. This, of cour se, means in theory that the Director of Central Intelligence has to be meticulous in his stewardship of such 'Black' funds - unless perchance the President himself happens to be corrupt, or to 'know everything', as allegedly was, and remains, the case with George Bush Sr.. 'What's more', Mr Robinson continued, Dwight Eisenhower created - and every President since has followed suit - a top-secret group to advise the CIA on the best use of those funds and, when necessary, to procure additional monies for specific covert operations. In Ike's day, the group was called the 5412 Committee, named for' (i.e., after - Ed.) 'the National Security Council paper that authorized it. It was then, and remains today, the most secret organization in the United States of America' 19 .

'Considered so ultra-sensitive that not even the National Security Council is kept informed of its activities, those few men who know about it refer to it simply as The Special Group' 20 . PRESIDENT 'PROTECTED' AGAINST BACKWASH FROM IRAN-CONTRA Just as the Soviets go in for relabelling elements of their security services, their US coun- terparts do the same. Various Administrations have altered the name of this 'Special Group' from 5412 to various other obscurely deri ved titles, including 'The 303' and \"The 40 Committee'. But the concept behind this ultra-secret organisation has remained unchanged (or at least that was the case wh en Robinson's book first appeared in 1994) - 'that it must be the Special Group, and not th e President, who offici ally approves certain plans - such as illegal interventions into the internal affairs of another State'. While 'the buck stops at the Oval Office', it appears that the President's approval of any Special Group proposal is only ever given verbally. Since all communications within the Oval Office are, as we all know from Watergate, recorded (by th e Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), which also monitors and records every telephone conv ersation into and out of Capitol Hill), a record obviously exists of verbal presidentia l approvals (although this statement needs to be qualified as well, since ONI has a habit, on occasion, of expunging certain communications and leaving tapes blank, where this is considered 'necessary'). The President will be briefed on a Spec ial Group proposal by a member of what Robinson calls 'the Cabal', consisting of the President's National Security Advisor, the Secretaries of State and Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. 'The members of the group work it out among themselves, and then brief the President. Nothing is written down with his name on it. Nothing is ever signed by him. That way, should something go wrong, the CIA can 'rightfully ' claim they acted on the aut hority of the Special Group, which means that the President can ostensibly deny that he has ever approved of such an activity' 21 . This is, of course, Talmudic loopholism, a.k.a. legal sheis-terism, at its 'finest'. Jeffrey Robinson appears, back in 1990, to have been extremely well informed, as this Author is about to confirm. As he pointed out, 'if, as has often been suggested, Ronald Reagan knew anything at all about the Iran-Contra affair, that would have been down to his Administration's equivalent of the 5412 Commi ttee.... Iran-Contra is, in fact, a perfect example of what the Committee is supposed to do. If you accept the premise that William Casey, as Director of Central Intelligence, committed the CIA to engage in the illegal activities for which Oliver North was tried, then the plan would almost certainly have been brought up in a Special Group meeting. The Se cretaries of State and Defence would have known about it, agreed to it, and presented it for final approval to the President. But because nothing is written down and therefore nothing can ever be traced back to the President' (except, this Author must add, from the recordings of what went on in the Oval Office), 'Ronald Reagan's denial of any know ledge of the affair is an impenetrable defence'. Even so, it may have been considered prudent for former President Reagan to"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 103 spend his final years in a state of mental confusion. An attempt to poison this Author, while in Washington, having been made in March 2005, the subject of the lengths to which certain forces within the US intelligen ce community are prepared to go, is naturally of exceptional continuing interest to him. According to research he has conducted, certain cadres possess access to the means to induce cancers (through, for instance, injecting a toothpaste tube using a syringe while the target is away from his hotel bedroom) and mind- eroding diseases like Alzheimer's. Nancy Reag an believed that more than one attempt was made on her husband's life and she is reported to have intimated privately that the then Vice President may have been involved. The Author has established that the distinguished US Secret Service/Treasury intelligence officer Leo Wanta saved President Reagan's life once (he informed the Author modestly, but the Author believes he may have done so on two separate occasions). It would have made typically diabolical sense for the forces in question to have decided that it would be safest to have President Reagan's mind confused beyond any possibility of him recalling any de tails about Iran-Contra (a phrase which stands for a much wider range of operations than is usually implied) by artificially inflicting him with Alzheimer's. Everything could then be wrapped up with a magnificent funeral, attended by the Great and the Good. President Reagan's Special Gr oup empowered the CIA 'to funnel money to right-wing forces that were trying to overthrow the leftist government of Mauritius, to spend millions trying to destabilise Colonel Qadhafi's regime in Libya and to bankroll the Afghan rebels with hundreds of millions of dollars. White House and CIA records now [Robinson's book is dated 1994, as noted - Ed.] suggest that in the first six years of his Administration, Reagan knew of and/or approved of at least 60 money-laundering plots to finance CIA covert activities'. Innumerable examples of such covert illegal activities abroad could be listed, ranging from the Bay of Pigs to the complex Financial Warfare operations aimed against the Soviet system. It is only necessary to mention here one instance of such activity that appeared to be especially pertinent during the summer of 2005. Since 9/11, the US Government has been empowered by the complacent and hijacked Congress to undertake almost any subversive operation clandestinely. The Mujahadeen el-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition terrorist group, once directed by Saddam Hussein's Mukhabarat security services, was reported by Scott Ritter, the former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, to be 'now working exclusively for the CIA's Directorate of Operations' 22 - a transformation that will ha ve been effected with the lubricational assistance of untold sums of cl andestinely assembled 'Black Ops' money. Mr Ritter commented that 'it is a bitter irony that the CIA is using a group still labelled as a terrorist organisation, a group trained in the art of explosive assassination by the same intelligence units of the former regime of Saddam Hussein, who are slaughtering American soldiers in Iraq today, to carry out remote bombings in Iran of the sort that the Bush Administration condemns on a daily basis inside Iraq' 23 . But in a hell like this, U-turns and lies are the norm. It may help to pause to highlight a crucial insight that emerges here. All of a sudden, brutalised intelligence structur es that were accustomed to fulfilling the commands of the Saddam Hussein regime, since overthrown by the United States, are being used by the former Iraqi regime's enemy to implement its policy in Iraq. Likewise, during and after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Shah's dreaded SAVAK secret police structures switched sides and served the Illuminati-controlled Islamic governing structures with even greater zeal than they had defended the Shah's regime. Similar switches took place"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"104 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs in Afghanistan. The objective observer has a choice: he can simply put such 'adjustments' down to pragmatic, opportunist intelligence community decision-making or else he can pay attention to what such 'switching' implies. What it implies is that the terrorism and drug- trafficking structures that may be at loggerheads at one point in time, cooperate closely in other (later) circumstances, so that loyalties among them have no ultimate meaning. That would be 100% consistent with the central finding and theme of this book, which is that opposing dialectical 'forces' are manipulated by the double-minded Illuminati master strategists and operatives (w hich are far from being unidentifiable, as will be shown) in what they consider to be a wholly mechanistic world. The accuracy of this assessment will become apparent in Chapter 7 on the Illuminati. Even more apparently incongruously, the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld had, by midsummer's day 2005, paid two known visits to Azerbaijan, the fief-dom of the son of the former Brezhnev era Communist Party boss and apparatchik, KGB General Gaidar Aliyev, to prepare the ground for 'a ma ssive military presence that will foretell a major land-based campaign designed to capture Tehran' 24 , according to Mr Ritter. Earlier, Mujahedeen rebels in Afghanistan, who were, late that year, operating as elements of the 'Northern Alliance' fighting the Taleban, which was standing in the way of US oil projects in the region, were corralled into the new Afghani official structures and Government following the US attack on Afghanistan in la te 2001. These Mujahedeen had been heavily engaged in drug trafficking in earlier years, while fighting against the Soviet-supported Government. Among these drug cadres, the CIA's main client was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a leading Afghani drug lord and heroin refiner. CIA-supplied trucks and mules that had previously conveyed US arms into Afghanistan were now used in order to transport opium to laboratories along the Afghani/Pakistani border. The output from these laboratories provided, for some years, up to 50% of the heroin consumed annually in the United States and 75% of the heroin used in Western Europe. In 1990, US officials admitted that they had failed to investigate or take any action against these drug operations, out of a desire 'not to offend' their Afghani and Pakistani associates. Dennis Dayle, a former head of a key department within the US Drug Enforcement Administration made the following statement to a journalist in the late 1990s: 'If the following statement were made to Am erican citizens, would you agree with it? \"Enormously powerful criminal organizations are controlling many countries, and to a certain degree controlling the world, and controlling our lives. Your own [US] Government to some extent supports them and is concealing this fact from you\". I KNOW that to be true. That is not conjecture. Experience, over the better part of my adult life, tells me that this is so. And there is a great deal of pers uasive evidence.... You can cont ain drug trafficking by the immobilization of the few cartels that truly control it...'. AND BY IMMOBILISING THE INTELLIGENCE CADRES, LIKE BRITAIN'S CORRUPT GO-2, WHICH FACILITATE THE CARTELS' OPERATIONS. 'IF YOU ATTACK THE DRUG OPERATIONS, THEY WILL KILL YOU' As noted on page 81, this was the warning issued in 2005 to t he Author by a very friendly US intelligence executive. This book could not have been published without a detailed expose of international com petitive drug-trafficking, which the intelligence officer concerned agreed is an abomination and a crime against humanity. The warning was issued not as a threat but in the Author's interest. However this study would have made no sense without a proper look at the drug-trafficking component of the unprecedented international crisis. Drugs support the internat ional financial system, although sophisticated hypothecation techniques have been developed which can function independently of open-ended laundered drug money flows. A Great Power like the United States - and a Great financial Power like Britain - should summon the courage and the greatness to renounce this abomination. Britain can lead the way immediately by putting its secret 'Black' inte lligence agency GO-2, which is supposed to combat the drug offensive, out of business forthwith. How about it? ■"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 105 Unfortunately, however, Mr Doyle, though operating at the 'sharp end' of the inadequate US 'war against drugs', may not have been aware that the Colombian drug cartels were themselves established by the Central Intelligence Agency, spearheaded by a STASI (cover for DVD) operative called Carlos Lehder (son of th e Nazi escapee Wilhelm Lehder) who may have used his CIA cover itself as cover for his STASI (former Eastern German intelligence) connections, which was in turn a cover for his true allegiance - to the covert Nazi DVD, based in Dachau. A certain number of STASI operatives are known to have been operating for some years with or within the US intelligence community, one prominent and powerful (not to mention ruthless) such operative having been a certain Eva Teleki (real name Sturzl), who moved to London in 2004. She controlled billions of dollars' worth of funds belonging to the US Government, and was suspected by certain intelligence experts as being or having been a paymaster for Al-Qaeda cells operating in the United Kingdom, of which there were then said to be at least 15, as late as September 2005. Mr Doyle's observation that the US Government 'to some extent supports them' (the powerful criminal organisations, which are manifestations of the Illuminati - the Mafia having been established in Italy by Giuseppe Mazzini, the occultist and partner of the notorious necromancer and Masonic king-pin Albert Pike, and the founder of modern Italy), 'and is concealing this fact from you' (the American people), was of course a gross understatement. Forget the modifying phrase 'to some extent'. The reality is worse by an order of magnitude: together or in competition with the intelligence services of the covert Soviets, the Israelis, Chinese Communists, Britain, France, Germany, Spain and The Netherlands and others, elements of the CIA have organised and were/are running frenetic, lucrative, controlling drug-traffickin g warfare operations in Latin America, Afghanistan, Turkey and elsewhere. The participation of government agencies in this evil business is a scandal of millennial proportions wh ich will result in the corruption of all ordered governance everywhere, since the financial, banking and capitalist systems have become victims and collaborators in this historically unprecedented global organised intelligence crime wave. And the corruption of governance is what the planners of the New Underworld Order, the Illuminati, both anticipate and always intended. It is also what Boris Uvarov predicted [see page 88]. THE CYNICAL MANIPULATION OF 'DEMOCRATISM' In the US context, such operations will certain ly have been pre-approved by the 'Black Ops' financial centre, or 'Special Group', which controls funds of such magnitude that it need never apply to Congress for permission for anything. This means, self-evident-ly, that this secret sub-Cabinet level organisation is much more powerful than any other component of the US Government, including the President himself - which in turn means that the United States' democracy is a total sham. It is, in fact, nothing more than a thoroughly dishonest display of 'democratism' - meaning in the Soviet context, the creation and maintenance of the illusion of democracy. This word is to be found in the Soviet literature - for instance, on page 96 of 'Proletarian Internationalism: Guideline of th e Communists', by V. Plyanksky, published in 1970 by Novosti Press Agency Publishing House, Moscow 25 . The United States practices a form of 'democratism' - maintaining the illusion of democracy for public consumption, but in practice offering the electorate no more than the appearance of a choice of personnel ostensibly from the 'Left' or the 'Right' of the dialectic, while the intelligence services, which are in turn controlled by the Illuminati at the highest levels, in fact control the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches of"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs the overt Government, selecting and imposing their own candidates. Both countries cynically and corruptly prac tice forms of 'democratism', in order to sustain the elite intelligence controllers' fragile 'legitimacy', although the covert Soviet model is the subject, from time to time, of literary inventiveness - the most recent example being a definition offered by Irina Khakamada, who had the effrontery to stand against GRU-President Putin in the controlled and manipulated March 2004 Russian 'presidential election', but was unable to obtain any air-time on NTV. 'There is no democracy in Russia', she told 'The Guardian' in July 2005 26 : 'There is only a virtual matrix of democratic space created by the Kremlin's Political Departmenf, since in fake 'posf-Soviet Russia it is not even considered safe to allow 'democratism ' games such as are orchestrated in the United States to sustain the illusion th at the people can influence the outcome of elections other than by means of changes of personnel. Whereas in the United States, it does not matter who wins elections, since the intelligence services always win, in covert Soviet Russia, it does not matter who wins elections, as the covert Communists, controlled by the intelligence services with which the covert Communist Party of the Soviet Union is integrated, always win 27 . As Mme Khakamada elaborated, the Kremlin's Political Department 'copies reality. If there is a democratic opposition to the Kr emlin, it creates a different one loyal to the Kremlin'. Irina Khakamada explained how a rise in leftwing youth activism was countered by the Kremlin launching \"Nashi\" - a youth group designed to tackle 'Fascism' and corrupt bureaucracy - that held a 60,000-str ong rally in Moscow under police protection. 'This system creates dangers', she added. 'When I was competing for the Presidency, an important part of the audience was thinking I was part of the matrix'. She added that only her strong criticism of the Kremlin's handling of the Nord Ost theatre siege, in which 129 people died, proved to voters that she was genuine. However Mme Khakamada's candour was itself false: all political activists on the Moscow stage are 'part of the matrix', as the entire political charade continues, as has been the case for over two decades, to be managed along Leninist deception lines (whe reby political opposition forces and factions are all centrally controlled) for ignorant Western public consumption. WHERE INTELLIGENCE IS IN CONTROL, CORRUPTION IS THE NORM In a controlled, false 'democracy', where the intelligence services call all the shots, the primary issue facing the society is invariably corruption, which typically assumes (as has happened in these countries) epidemic proportions, and where corrupt practices are cynically accepted as the norm - give or take some cosmetic arrangements, such as the feeble US anti-drug structures, designed to enable the double-minded controllers to maintain at all times that 'everything is be ing done to see to it that these problems are addressed' etc, etc, etc. Jeffrey Robinson's observation that 'if you accept the premise that William Casey, as Director of Central Intelligence, committed the CIA to engage in the illegal activities for which Oliver North was tried, then the plan would almost certainly have been brought up in a Special Group mee ting', was extremely prescient. The Author has obtained, from deep within US intelligence, the text of an Affidavit prepared six months before his death by William Casey, President Re agan's Director of Central Intelligence, in which the accuracy of Mr Robinson's assessment is confirmed (except that this Author suggests that, as will be seen, the operations iden tified therein may have been so secret that not even the 'Special Group' was officially aware of them: indeed, this is implied by the text of the late William Casey's document)."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 107 The text that follows was provided by the Author's source prior to its inclusion in documentation associated with the case of [Colonel, a.k.a.

The document subsequently formed part of the defendant Tyree's case against the US Department of the Army, Civil Action Number 99cv2709, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, dated 8th November 1999, presided over by The Honourable Colleen Kolla r-Kotelly, filed by the Attorney of Record, Raymond Kohlman, of 7 Milton Street, Attleboro, Massachusetts 02703.

Casey later committed suicide in hospital in order to protect the President of the United States, according to a very senior knowledgeable 28 source, and contrary to the received views that he died of natu ral causes or was murdered. 'I, William J. Casey, declare: I have found that freedom is a priceless commodity that demands constant vigilance to guaranteed [sic] its longevity. 1.

After I became Director of Central Inte lligence (DCI) on January 28, 1981, I was approached and briefed by William Colby, former DCI. My history with Bill Colby is known. Colby notified me off the record of two operations he was still running in Latin America [i.e., Colby continued running these af ter he had ceased to be DCI - Ed.]. Both operations were without the knowledge of, and consent of, the United States Congress, President Ronald Reagan or even the United St ates intelligence apparatus' [implying that operations sanctioned and in itiated by the 'Special Group' may bypass even the intelligence structures themselves, which has obvious further implications - Ed.]. 'Colby identified the operations as \"A-6\" (RED MIST) and \"A-7\" (PROJECT SANDMAN). A-7 entailed smaller operations. I was told that A-6 identified individuals and the build-up of the Communist threat in Latin America. Some intelligence collected in A-6 was used in TASK FORCE-157 [the details of whic h Casey did not identify here - Ed.]. 3. I was told that A-7 was \"the Phoenix program\" of Latin America. It involved the assassination of the Communist infrastructure throughout Latin America. I was told that Colby authorized assets involved in A-6 and A- 7 to engage in narcotics trafficking to finance both operations [sic]. Colby engaged in similar operations that I know of in Vietnam for the same reason. 4. Colby candidly informed me that he had prepositioned more than one million pounds of cocaine in Panama between Decemb er 1, 1975 and April 1, 1976. This was done with the aid of our gallant ally, Gene ral Manuel Noriega. The cocaine was trans- ported into El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras between 1976 and 1981. Colby now sat in front of me with hat in hand and requested my help in the delivery of the cocaine to the American market. 5. I was told that Colby was using a mutual friend of ours, Colonel Albert Vincent Carone, United States Army, Military Intelligence, to field A-6 and A-7. Al Carone is a charismatic patriot that General Joseph W. St ilwell [sic] introduced us to in late 1945. Beside the usual qualifications, Al Carone br ought to the anti-Communist effort a direct connection to his longterm friend, Vito Genovese. 6. Genovese was the head of gambling and narc otics for the controlling Mafia family in New York to [sic] which Carone was made a member. Carone is a friend of international fugitive Robert Vesco [resident in Castro's Cuba, Fidel Castro being a Jesuit-educated intelligence officer - Ed.]. Carone has several an ti-Communist intelligence sources that include Marita Lorenz, a [German] frie nd of Fidel Castro. Al Carone is the younger brother of Dr Pasquale Carone.

Colby told me that the profits from the prepositioned cocaine would be laundered through Al Carone, the New York Mafia and Ro bert Vesco [who, as indicated, was hiding in Communist Cuba, indicative of Illuminati double-minded, two-facedness - Ed.], then redirected to the anti-Communist effort through Colby. 8. After discussion with Al Carone, I made the decision to bring the prepositioned cocaine into Mena Airport, Mena, Arkansas. Central Intelligence has used Mena Airport on prior occasions.

By 1984, all prepositioned cocaine had arrived at Me na Airport and additional cocaine sources were secured.

Bill Clinton [when Governor of Arkansas] has proved invaluable so far by con taining the local law enforcement investigations into the intelligence activity at Mena'. • The Author interrupts here to make a critical point. Until President George W. Bush Jr. signed the National Intelligence Reform Act on 17th December 2004 (one-third of which is secret, so that no-one knows what the Act contains - an astonishing development given the United States' (false) image as a pa ragon of transparent democracy -Ed.), it was of course illegal for the CIA to conduct operations on American soil (a rule which the CIA broke routinely; but neverthele ss, it was illegal). More generally, since the CIA's clandestine operations are almost invariably illegal, the intelligence community is at constant risk of mobilising the forces of law enforcement (not to be confused with law and order) against them. The obsessive secrecy surrounding operations and the identities of operatives is driven in part by this reality. Historically, when things go badly wrong (as in the Iran-Contra nexus of cases), exposure of the Agency' illegal operations occurs inter alia as a consequence of this institutionalised tendency for the clandestine services to clash with the Rule of Law, and hence with law enforcement. The underlying, and inescapable, conclusion to be drawn is that the serially illegal operations of the US intelligence services are incompatible with the 'freedom' which President Bush Jr., for instan ce, preaches to the Rest of the World ideologically. Scott WILLIAM WELD: COCAINE SHIPMENTS FIXER William F. Weld was cited by William Casey, the late Director of Central Intelligence under President Reagan (who committed suicide in hospital in order to protect his President), as the primary legal 'fixer' whose job was to frustrate a nd neutralise bona fide investigations into the cocaine shipments into Mena, Arkansas. 'Bill Weld ', Casey affirmed, 'as Assistant United States Attorney, was placed in charge of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. This was done so that Bill Weld could control investigations into Mena by Federal law enforcement agencies. The placement of Weld... proved invaluable'. In other words, this man, who later became the Governor of Massachusetts, and in 2005 announced that he would be running for the Govern orship of New York St ate, obstructed justice ostensibly in the interests of national security, but actually (or also) in order to facilitate the distribution of poisonous drugs destined for c onsumption by American citizens in gross contravention of the law. Drug -running is a crime against humanity, and aiding and abetting it represents wilful participation in a crime against humanity. William F Weld has played an important behind-the-s cenes role in furthering preparations for the imposition of the New Underworld Order upon the world, again ostensibly 'in the interests of US national security'. He was, for instance, the reci pient of a letter dated 16th May 1985 from William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney G eneral, Civil Rights Division, of the US D epartment of 'Justice', now in the public domain, which read as follows: 'Dear Mr Weld: As agreed Messrs Manichur Ghorbanifar, Adnan Khashoggi, and Richard Armitage will broker the transaction of PROMIS software to Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz for resale and general distribution as gifts in his region, contingent upon the three conditions we last spoke of. PROMIS must have a soft arrival. No paperwork, customs, or delay. It must be equipped with the special data retrieval unit. As before, you must walk the financial aspects through Credit Suisse into [Mahfouz'] National Commercial Bank. If you encounter any problems, contact me directly. Sincerely, Wm.

'\"Liberation\" and \"democr acy\", he wrote in June 2005, 'have become none-too-subtle code words within the neo-con servative Cabal that formulates and executes American foreign policy today, for militarism and war' 29 . And the Author goes yet further than Mr Ritt er, whose statement is correct, as far as it goes. For the Illuminati, who ultimately control the intelligence services, democracy is impermanent and will be discarded and dispen sed with at the appropriate time. That time has already passed, so that US democracy is now , as indicated, an illusion, a deception, and a variant of Soviet 'democratism'. In due course, the nuisance of having to go through the massive inconvenience of 'fighting' and riggi ng elections, will be discarded altogether. Therefore, when the President of the Unite d States uses the weasel words 'democracy' and 'liberation' or 'freedom' in justification of the Illuminati policies which he is helping to carry out, the fact that these are empty slogans is, to him and his associates, neither here nor there - since for these people, as with Lenin, all institutions are temporary, expendable, transitory, and replaceable in accordance with the requirements of the World Revolution of the ffluminati that these people in reality serve. THE US GOVERNMENT TRUSTOR WHO 'ROSE FROM THE 'DEAD' It is also appropriate here to interpolate another crucially important fact. This is that operatives professionally engaged for many y ears in implementing the hidden policies of the ffluminati may normally have been in ignoran ce of the fact that this is what they were doing. It is obvious that William Casey thought that the conflict between 'freedom' (as he put it in his Affidavit) and Communism was a life-or-death struggle upon which the future of humanity rested - whereas it turned out to be just a stage in the manipulated and orchestrated arena of controlled tensions that the ffluminati's deeper strategists were accustomed to managing and directing given their concept of the world as a 'mechanical space' within which opposing forces could be manipulated - since they believe that the universe is mechanical, and the opposing forces that they purport to control are likewise mechanical, although they may pay lip service (only) to the concepts of good and evil. They can do no more than that - since for these people, Lucifer is good and Adonai (Jesus Christ) is the epitome of evil, as he stands for the opposite of their 'Do as Thou Wilt' philosophy and alibi. Leo Wanta has acknowledged to the Author, again for the record 30 , that he and his colleagues 'did not understand' at the time that their operations were furthering the strategies of the Illuminati. They thought that they were working exclusively for Uncle Sam. The Author's judgment, having interviewed this heroic US figure at length, is that this entirely spontaneous admission, was thoro ughly honest, and in no way contrived. The Author had burdened him with no prior leading questions which might have elicited such an observation. This reinforces the Author's view that the Presidency of the United States, together with the US intelligen ce services, or key elements thereof, are in fact masquerading as instruments of the Government of the United States, while in practice they are being used as primary instruments of the Illuminati. To describe this central point in blunter language, the US Presidency and the intelligence community wh ich serves it have been hijacked by the Illuminati, in accordance with thei r modus operandi of inserting their agentur adjacent to or inside the highest levels of governance. In such conditions, a loyal servant of the United States such as Leo Wanta, whose patriotism no-one has ever, or could ever , question, was himself deceived and double- crossed, into believing that his loyalty was reciprocated at the very highest level -"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 111 Figure 26: As a senior US Secret Serv ice/Treasury/CIA/FBI Financial intelligenc e operator, Leo (Lee) Wanta, who saved President Reagan's life on at least one occasion, was called upon to verify payments associated with the raising from 200+ international banks of $27.5 trillion in 1989-91, an operation presid ed over inter alia (but mainly) by George H. W. Bush. The funds were raised to 'enhance' the so-called 'global secu rity environment', to buttress components of the international financial system, which may have been in systemic danger, and essentially to provide the New Underworld Order strategists (the llluminati's c ontrollers) with enough financial resources to impose their One World plans on the whole world, and to bribe every policymaker, intelligence officer, ruler, influential media baron, and other targeted power-broker, in the whole world, for the whole of the 21st century. Gorbachev sponsored a 'Global Security Project', and was closely involved with this operation. During the massive fund-raising, there was an 18-month hiatus, during which time the funds, to be paid out in US dollars, were held or sterilised by the Federal Reserve Board. When Wanta came to check through all the transactions, he found that large sums had been siphoned off into private accounts. In particular, George Bush Sr. (alleged DVD) had benefited, contrary to US law, as his note above makes clear."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"112 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs whereas in reality it was being abused. It is hardly surprising that, wh en President Bush Sr. came to demand that Wanta allow him to withdraw funds from the $210 billion on deposit in an account or accounts of Ameritrust, one of the Title 18, Section 6 US Government secret intelligence corporations of which Wanta was a co-signatory and Trustor, Wanta refused to give his signature for the wit hdrawal of the funds, on the ground that they belonged to the US Government, not to an individual. Later, when auditing geofin-ancial transactions associated with the raising of $27.5 trillion to finance the 'Global Security Environment' (code for the New World Order, a.k.a. 'The New Underworld Order') in his capacity as a high-level Secret Service/US Treasury op erative, Leo Wanta annotated a computer transactions print-out as follows: [Figure 26, page 111]: 'Acceptance of value by former US President of the United States, George (Jorge) Bush is direct violation of our USA Title 5, Section 7353, et seq. Jim Baker III told me to just \"SHUT UP\", as I am protected by Rogers -Houston Memorandum to \"co-operate\", but I kept receipts & notes'. What this meant was that, having discovered the alleged embezzlement by the former President of the United States, Wanta, as a special secret service agent, had alerted the Treasury to this state of affairs, only to be slapped down by Jim Baker, President Bush Sr's long-time factotum and 'fixer', who is himself a lawyer. All present and former Presidents of the United States, includin g those who are deceased, are protected in perpetuity by the Secret Se rvice. This gives them e ffective criminal immunity. So, having established that President Bush Sr . had allegedly arranged for the diversion of certain international funds, and given his mentioned earlier point-blank refusal to accommodate President Bush's demand that he disgorge for Mr Bush's alleged use separate US Government secret intelligence funds of which he was the custodian, Leo Wanta, arguably one of the most brilliant intelligence and Financial Warfare officials ever to have been employed by the US Governme nt - the man who saved President Reagan's life and engineered the financial submission of the Soviet Union in 1991 -f ound himself at the receiving end of the ruthless, revengeful wrath of the Illuminati.

He was then flown in shackles back to the United States, arraigned before a New York US court, released unconditionally, but rearrested on the Courthouse steps on a trumped-up State of Wisconsin tax evasion charge. This led to him being unjustly convicted and jailed for 22 years, although his sentence to jail was later commuted to house arrest.

As Trustor of the $27.5 trillion raised in 1989-92 from more than 200 international banks, for the 'Global Security Fund' and 'Environment' - an amount which was looted by criminalist cadres and worth well over $60 trillion by June 2006 - the reappearance of Leo Wanta on the scene when US intelligence had deliberately spread the lie that he was dead, caused a collective heart attack within the international financial community. The lie that Mr Wanta was dead had provided 'cover' for the misappropriation of these funds, located offshore, by crooked operatives and international banks, wh ich had been using them extensively as collateral, had cross-coll ateralised them and hypothecated thei r value, in some cases in order just to stay afloat. Thus the corrupt intelligence cadres and the banks had a community of interest in representing that Leo Wanta, the official Trustor on behalf of the US Government, was dead - relying upon Statutes of Limitations, upon administrative arrangements such as Lloyd Bank TSB's statement to the Author in April 2006 that 'we destroy documents after ten years', and on the unfounded belief that he was de ceased, which would have meant that the funds devolved to the banks. When it was discovered that he was NOT dead, both intelligence operatives and banks had to scramble to 'restore' or 'replace' trillions that had been misappropriated, misused or stolen. Underlying this colossal crisis was the dark state of affairs arising from President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 [see page 20], whereby US intelligence operatives are empowered to establish commercial corporations at home and abroad and to run their associated bank accounts, while denying any intelligence involvement. Given the intensity of CIA compartmentalisation, this enables crooked operatives to represent that the corporations in question are their own, ra ther than US Government, entities - which means that, if registered offshore as most of them are, operatives may be liable to seek to enrich themselves 'at the expense of the US Government itself. It is 'not for nothing', as they say in Moscow, that the Clintons have acquired (allegedly with such funds) property in the Irish Republic, which has no extradition treaty with the United States*. CIA BUSINESSES USED TO WASH FUNDS FOR COVERT OPERATIONS It is a tribute to Jeffrey Robinson's acumen that he managed to unravel so much before the concrete evidence of such activities became available to researchers who could slash their way through the dense undergrowth of disinformation which surrounds this dark forest of lies. For in The Laundrymen', discussing CIA-controlled businesses, or cut-outs, Robinson stated that the CIA had used them for years to wash money through them to pay for all sorts of covert activities. His context was a huge CIA command post located on the campus of the University of Miami, following the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Operatives there, under the codename JM/ WAVE, 'directed the activities of a reported 3,000 Cuban agents whom they'd set up in false businesses. 'In one particular case, a CIA *During his period at Oxford University, Bill Clinton shared a house at 46 Leckford Road, in 1968- 69, with Strobe Talbott, who later became Deputy Secretary of State under Clinton, and Frank Adler, who resisted the Vietnam draft and later committed suicide. The property earned its place in history as the house in which Clinton puffed on joints but 'didn't inhale', while he was supposedly studying on a Rhodes Scholarship. Four years later, a man called Howard Marks moved in with his girlfriend, to study physics. Not long after he left Oxford, Marks began dealing in drugs, and he ended up masterminding a drug cartel with a turnover of £100 million, before being arre sted and jailed for 25 years. After being released early from jail - perhaps he was a GO-2 asset? - he wrote a best-selling autobiography called 'Mr Nice'."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs operator found that he could make more m oney running an Agency cut-out than he could by staying on the payroll. According to the rules, he was required to turn over the extra money to the Government. So he simply resi gned from the CIA, kept the business and kept the profits. The CIA never said a word, because they couldn't admit they'd owned the business in the first place' 31 . And this was many years before President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 specifically authorised such intelligence cut-outs to be established and for their intelligence provenance to be denied. But we have diverged from the text of Casey's document, which continued: '11. Bill Weld, as Assistant United States Attorney, was placed in charge of the Criminal Division of the Depart ment of Justice. This was do ne so that Bill Weld could control investigations into Mena by Federal law enfor cement agencies. The placement of Weld has proved invaluable'. Here we have explicit confirmation that th e US intelligence community frustrates US domestic law enforcement, with which, as indicated, its operations are wholly incompatible - quite apart from being usually moral repugnant. Leo Wa nta explicitly told the Author that drug-trafficking is immoral and an abomination; but it was also he who then added that 'if you go after them, they will kill you' 32 . This was not a threat: he does not do that, as he is a devout follower of Jesus Christ. It was a warning about the viciousness of the Illuminati. It follows that the supremacy of the criminalised elements (especially the German-oriented components) of the US inte lligence community, which cooperate with and form part of, the flluminati, is a menace to the continued existence of the Republic. It has been consistently driving it in the direction required by the flluminati - which by definition can have nothing whatsoever to do with the interests of the people of the United States, let alone with those of the Rest of the World.

Casey'. • • • Now that this admission, from the late Director of Central Intelligence, that the CIA engages in drug-trafficking as a matter of deliberate state policy has been documented (rather than presumed from the vast accumulation of ci rcumstantial evidence hitherto in circulation), it is clearly this Author's straightforward duty to highlight, for the record, its fallacies and what this abominable revelation implies. In the first place, as already hinted, the former DCI was clearly ignorant of the fact that his focus on 'defeating Communism' in Latin America, and his mental approach to this challenge, precluded any understanding on his part of the fact that he, along with so many others, was no more than simply a manipulated pawn in the greater game of death being played by the invisible Illuminati handlers. For quite clearly, William Casey saw the challenge he thought he faced, in the same black-and-white terms as his predecessor, William Colby. And he believed his own slogans. The opposite of Communism, for him, was 'freedom'. Unless he was lying in his Affidavit, Mr Casey appeared to have no knowledge or inkling of the possibility that the Vice President he served was actually playing a much deeper game, serving enemy for ces beyond the United States w hose interests did not coincide with those of the American peop le. The Author wishes to emphasise this important fact, since Leo Wanta has separately and honestly confirmed in an interview with the Author, as indicated, that 'we didn't understand that at the time' [viz that the Illuminati were manipulating and directing our activities]. So, both William Casey and Leo Wanta were being deceived. Even the head of the CIA was a victim of the occultic Illuminist forces that control US intelligence. CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING TH E DEATH OF WILLIAM COLBY It is much less clear that Colby did not understand. Although it might appear from Casey's evidence that Colby sa w the Communist threat to 'democracy' in the same black- and-white terms, the fact that he was conti nuing to control two massive illegal operations in Latin America many years after he had ceas ed to be Director of Central Intelligence himself, suggests otherwise. Born on 4th January 1920, William Colby became Director of Central Intelligence on 4th September 1973 - following James R. Schlesinger, when President Nixon shifted him to the post of S ecretary of Defense. President Gerald Ford, the 'highest' and most occult Mason ever to have occupied the Oval Office, advised by Dr Henry Kissinger (the top Illuminati operative, alleged member of the 'high' German Illuminati Directorate, and the alleged Soviet agent BOR), dismissed Colby in late 1975, and replaced him by George H. W Bush. Schlesinger (of German extraction) resurfaced later as the head of the crucial Mitre Corporation [MIT -Massachusetts Institute of Technology] established by Kissinger himself. Since William Casey was not appointed CIA Director of Central Intelligence until January 1981, it is clear that William Colby cont inued to run the super-secret intelligence operations A-6 and A-7, the existence of which was unknown to the President, Congress and the intelligence community, between the date of his repl acement by George Bush Sr. in late 1975 and January 1981, a period of more than five years."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"116 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs If Casey's statement that William Colby said that not even the intelligence com- munity knew about these operations, a fresh question arises: whos e operations were they? This Author believes that, in the light of what follows, they represented secret operations of German 'Black' intelligence, since later in this work it will be revealed, from an Illuminati defector source, that the global dr ug trade is run by the Illuminati. And it will also fall out that the cover of defeating Communism in Latin America was indeed used to procure the establishment by the CIA of the Latin American cartels. For these were, as we shall see, far from 'stand-alone' phenomena. On 29th April 1996, a correspondent for th e UK newspaper Dail y Express, Peter Birkett, told Chris Ruddy of NewsMax.co m, that his newspaper's MI6 sources had claimed that William Colby was assassinated by US intelligence operatives, presumably to cover up the Latin American cartels scandal. Colby was reported to have disappeared from his country home on the Wicomico River in Ma ryland. The immediate official 'line' was that he had died in a canoeing accident, af ter his waterlogged canoe was found on the shore near his home. The Associated Press, which has become more and more of an official mouthpiece, reported that Colby wa s 'missing and presumed drowned', having died as the result of 'an apparent boating accident'. The news agency elaborated that Mrs Colby, who was in Texas at the time that her husband had disappeared, had spoken by telephone with him on the day that he had vanished, and that he had told her that he was not feeling well 'but was going canoeing anyway'. A week later, Mrs Colby rebutted the Associated Press report, tellin g The Washington Times that her husband had been perfectly well and had made no mention of going canoeing. The cause of death was reportedly a so- called aneurism, causing him to drown, resulting in hypothermia. However Mrs Colby later said that her husband had said in his phone call that he planned to have his dinner, take a shower, and go to bed. Investigators said that he left his dinner unfinished, went out in his canoe in the middle of the night on a rough and windy river without his lifejacket, experienced a heart attack, and drowned. His body, inevitably, surfaced in the water, near his waterlogged canoe, a week later. Researchers, naturally un convinced, due to the failure of the facts to match, added Colby to the list of 82 operatives and others who had, by that early stage, died suspiciously since President Clinton came to office, murdered in part by agents of his predecessor. Given that some 450+ operatives and others w ith detailed knowledge of dimensions of the nexus of scandals still called 'Iran-Contra' had been 'taken down', incarcerated, liquidated or placed under house arrest as the intellig ence community scrambled to cover up their illegal operations, or rather to pour sand onto the raging fire of controversy which partial exposure of its 'heart of darkness' and of its illegal activitie s had ignited, William Colby's suspicious 'drowning' must indeed be counted among the hundreds of casualties of these endless scandals. This Author has separately described the purges and murders which took place during the Clinton era as the US intelligen ce community struggled to cover up its past misdeeds, as comparable to one of the multiple waves of arrests, liquidations and false accusation fests perpetrated under Stalin (Djugashvili), albeit of less horrendous proportions. They presage much worse purges to come, given the readiness and ease with which those abominations were committed, as the Republic ditches its false democracy, scraps the Constitution, and realises the full potential of the Third Reich which has surreptitiously installed itself in Washingt on. This will only happen, however, if the German-oriented Fifth Column gains the deci sive upper hand, which was still far from inevitable, as late as mid-2006."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 117 HOW THEY 'JUSTIFY' DRUG-TRAFFIC KING IN THEIR TWISTED MINDS The familiar and probably to come extent diversionary focus on Clinton as the instigator of such abominations diverts attention from the likelihood that these murders -and the hundreds of arrests, incarcerations and 'disappearances' reported routinely during the Clinton years - were orchestrated by the 'German' elements of the US intelligence community, fearful that their nefarious secret activities would culminate in a decisive backlash. The fact that they have been so comprehensively covered up, despite multiple leaks via the courts and in the open media, makes this a certainty. Just as likely is the parallel reality that since the Iran-Contra anti-Co mmunism operations masked the deeper Illuminati drug-running programme, the multiple 'Clinton deaths' were actually Illuminati assassinations in all but name. And since the Illuminati provide German 'Black' intelligence with what it has hitherto assumed to be impenetrable cover, the phrases 'German Black intelligence' and 'Illuminati' are fully interchangeable here. Put another way, the Illuminati Dark Forces would resort to anything to hide their global drug operations, and would never brook typically botched US intelligence operations exposing the Illuminati's dr ug-running and money-making activities. The second irony is that the late Director Casey's justification for the illegal operations initiated under William Colby that he adopted and expanded, was intellectually flawed. The Author has been informed that drug-taking is considered by the perpetrators to be 'recreational', so that what is happening is that a product that is 'required' and 'in demand' for recreational use, is being supplied - the unspoken corollary being: what is wrong with that? How can anyone who is not depraved use this crass argument? But since this spurious argument appears to remain intact to this day, the Author hereby takes it upon himself to demolish it, even though this task has long since been conscientiously performed by Dr Joseph D Douglass Jr, in his book: 'Red Cocaine: The Drugging of America and the West' 33 [Edward Harle Limited, London & New York, 1999]. Dr Douglass conclusively demonstrated what ought to be apparent to CIA analysts who know a thing or two about psychotropic drugs (after all, MK-ULTRA and its parallel and successor 'Black' programmes were/are CIA operations), that marihuana, cocaine, heroin and artificial drugs are not naturally in demand, but rather that on the contrary, supply stimulates demand, rather than the other way round. What Casey's mistaken argument omits is the nature of these drugs. If you eat an ora nge and decide that you would like to eat more oranges because they taste nice, you are doing y ourself no harm, as oranges are a natural food provided for our nutrition and enjoyment. But these drugs are not nutritious: they are addictive. The demand that arises following their supply is a consequence not of 'recreational demand' but of demand resulting from addiction. The fact that the source of demand for dr ugs is their addictiv e characteristic pre- supposes that if the drugs are not available, then addiction cannot occur, given the lack of supply. In other words, William Casey's argument, which is evidently sustained as an alibi by CIA drug-runners and their controllers to this day, is based upon an egregious, diabolical, disgraceful lie. For any supposedly civilised government to permit elements of its structures to conduct (in the case of the United States, on a colossal scale) drug-running operations, and to justify such nefarious behaviour by resort to a lie as crude as this, is beyond catastrophic. It represents the grandfather of all scandals. This necessary condemnation applies to the Author's own Government as well, given the intelligence now to hand about the corrupt drug- running activities of the GO-2 intelligence ca dre working from within MI6 headquarters in Lambeth, Central London."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"118 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs To this lie is often attached the further deceit that 'if we don't do it, others will fill our shoes'. To which the answer is: so what? If other evil states sponsor drug-running operations, that is a scandalous matter for th eir own governments or peoples to address. The United States has created or elaborated a glob al drug monstrosity, financing its intelligence operations from drug-running just like the Chinese and the Soviets. And the most powerful drug-running country today is arguably the United States. If a miracle were to happen, and the overpowerful US intelligence services were to be brought to book and forced (somehow) to cease and desist , a vast component of the drug scourge that is degrading mankind would be neutralised. The Unit ed States could then begin to restore its globally shattered and tawdry reputation by deploying resources in opposition to the equally nefarious drug-running opera tions of its dialectical rivals. Unfortunately, this is evidently not about to happen, because drug-running is an operation not just of US intelligence, but of the I lluminati which controls it, or elements of it. Hence, there is, as matters stand, no will to address this gargantuan crisis, not least because the continued 'integrity' of the international financial system depends upon the continued pipeline of laundry money generated by the drug trade. The money supply expands to meet the demand for funds with whic h purchases of drugs are financed. William Casey ran his argument into a brick wall with his penultimate statements that 'the drug user[s] had the freedom to make a choice. They chose the drug'. The deceitful implication here is that the user of drugs has the choice to cease to consume them. The answer to that is that (a) he would not have begun to consume them if the CIA/DVD had not facilitated th eir supply in the first place {see above) and (b) that once addicted (which can happen almost immediately), exercising 'the freedom to make a choice' becomes at once extremely diffic ult, for physiological reasons. It is true that druggies can, with an immense effort of will, achieve separation from these products of the Devil. But, as the late Mr Casey and all those CIA and other US intelligence officers who sup with the Devil on th is score know perfectly well, the addictive characteristics of the drugs ensure that the ba lance of probability is that the drug addict will constantly seek to renew the temporary gratification obtained from using the drugs supplied by the CIA's drug operatives and fo reign criminalised intelligence collaborators. Therefore, the argument deployed here is thoroughly dishonest. It is a lie. Finally, William Casey admitted in his Affidavit that he couldn't care less about (a) the fact that he had violated the Geneva Convention or (b) that his actions condemned 'countless Americans to drug dependency'. Th e Author will spell this out more clearly: The late head of the US intelligence community stated that he was perfectly comfortable 'condemning countless Americans to drug dependency'. Note that Mr Casey used the imprecise ph rase 'countless', which, taken literally and in context, might be construed as implying indifference as to whether the number of Americans whose lives his actions blighted and destroyed in exchange for 'freedom' amounted to a thousand, ten million, or two hundr ed million. That is what his statement means. If 200,000,000 Americans were condemned to drug dependency, that would have been fine with the late Director of Central Intelligence. The victims would have been dead by now - but free! Since none of his successors ha ve done anything to reverse this activity, and what follows will reveal and confirm that the so-called Colombian drug cartels were established by US intelligence, it is clear that the United States is in desperate need of leadership by people who can think straight, and whose minds are not confused, who judgment is not wanting and who are not Luciferians."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 119 Criminal governance can never escape detection. The US authorities have been criticised for failures surrounding their handling and interpretation of warnings ahead of the 9/11 attacks, with a strong overtone of suspicion that the authorities themselves may have been complicit in the catastrophes. It is now well understood in sensitive quarters in both London and Washington that Al-Qaeda is a front for German/French 'Black' intelligence and that the explosive charges which demolished the US buildings were laid by collaborators. The backgrounds of key individuals such as George Tenet, allegedly an asset of French intelligence, and of his mentor, the Skull and Bones alumnus David L. Boren [see page 587 et seq.], later the head of the University of Oklahoma, in whose backyard a number of operatives associated with the atrocities lived and were trained, reinforce evidence separately sifted by US and UK inte lligence that 9/11 and 7/11 were acts of war committed against the United States and Britain, which, if repeated, may trigger very grave consequences. The discovery that the Northern Underground Line beneath the Thames was meant to have been breached by a bomb, and upwards of 10,000 Londoners drowned on 7/7, plus GCHQ intercepts associated with the attacks pinpointing French and German 'Black' intelligence involvement, have been kept - like the real conclusions about 9/11 - under wraps, for one reason only: the desire to avoid the prospect of a Third World War, not against the covert Soviet Union, but once again against Germany, the Nazi Continuum of which has, by its own admission (see Chapter 8) never ceased waging war against the 'main enemy' - Britain and the United States. The methods employed include proxy terrorism, bribery, corruption, Fifth Column penetration, and drugs. THE AFFIDAVIT OF US SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER EDWARD P. CUTOLO The next 'smoking gun' document confirms how extensive the super-secret off-off-budget and hidden operations revealed to William Casey by Colby had been, providing further documented proof of CIA drug-running operations. It is an Affidavit by Edward P. Cutolo, dated 18th March 1980 34 , the details of which corrobor ate Casey's assertions, provide extraordinary insights into possible tensions between the Illuminati forces and corrupt elements of the US intelligence community, and reveal collaboration with Israeli intelligence (known as Megawatt operations). The text of this Affidavit, dated 8th March 1980, is given below in full. [The reader is asked to exercise patience as the narrative develops]: 'I, Edward P. Cutolo, having been duly sworn, do state under oath: 1. I am currently the Commanding Offi cer of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, Fort Devens, Massachusetts. 2. I swear affirmation to the contents of this affidavit freely and without coercion or threat to my person. 3. In December 1975, I spoke with Colonel \"Bo\" Baker concerning a classified mission that he commanded during that month, inside Colombia. The mission was known as WATCHTOWER. [Note: Colonel A. J. Baker, a US intelligence officer, later died mysteriously in Germany while undergoing minor surgery at a US facility - a familiar 'happening', the Author understands. At the last count, the total number of operatives, lawyers and others associated with Iran-Contra to have been 'taken down' exceeded 430 - Ed.]. 4. Following a lengthy discussion with Col. Baker, I was introduced to Mr. Edwin Wilson and Mr. Frank Terpil. Both Wilson and Terpil were in the employ of the Central Intelligence Agency. Both Wilson and Terpil inquired if I was interested in working for short periods of time in Colombia and I acknowledged that I was. 5. In February 1976, I commanded the second WATCHTOWER Mission into Colombia. This mission was 22 days long a nd ended with only one reportable incident"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"120 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs occurring between team members and a Colombian army unit. There were no fatalities received by WATCHTOWER team members. There was no indication that the Colombian army unit sustained fatalities. 6. The purpose of Operation WATCHTOWER was to establish a series of three electronic beacon towers beginni ng outside of Bogota, Colombia and running northeast to the border of Panama. Once the WATCHTOWER teams (Special Action Teams) were in place, the beacon was activated to emit a signal that aircraft could fix on and fly undetected from Bogota into Panama, before landing at Albrook Air Station. 7. During the February 1976 WATCHTOWER Mission, 30 high performance aircraft landed safely at Albrook Air Station where the aircraft were met by Colonel Tony [sic] Noriega, who is a Panama Defence Force [P DF] Officer currently assigned to the Customs and Intelligence Section. Noriega normally was in the company of other PDF officers who were known to me as Major Diaz-Herrera, Major Luis del Ci d, and/or a Major Ramirez. Also present at most of the arrivals, was Edwin Wilson, and an unidentified male Israeli national. 8. The cargo flown from Colombia into Panama consisted of cocaine. 9. The [mentioned] male Israeli national was identified and known to members of the [US] 570th Military Intelligence Group in Pana ma who only specified that this individual had the authority from the U.S. Army Southern Command in Panama to be in the A.O. [sic]. 10. In March, 1976, a third WATCHTOWER Mission was implemented and I was in command of that mission which lasted 29 days and engaged in the same tactics used in the February 1976, mission. The March mission en countered a serious accident and resulted in several Special Action Team members being in jured from wounds suffered while they were attempting to exfiltrate from Colombia across the border into Panama where helicopters were waiting to extract them. 11. The March 1976 mission incident occurred as the Special Action Team that was on station at Turbo, Colombia, encountered 40 to 50 armed men. Action Intelligence reports identified the armed men as local bandits. In regards to this incident the helicopters waiting in Panama, to extract the Special Action Team, entered Colombian air space without authorization and successfully extr acted the Special Action Team, after an estimated six- or seven-minute fire-fight. 12. During the March 1976, WATCHTOWER Mission, 40 high performance aircraft landed safely at Albrook Air Station where they were met in the previously related fashion by those named. 13. After the WATCHTOWER Mission in March 1976, I lost touch with several of the men who had served on the Special Action Te ams. I made no attempt to locate them. 14. In 1978, I assumed command of the 10th Sp ecial Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Devens and recognized two soldiers [there]. 15. The two soldiers [that] I recognized were assigned to 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne). One [of them] was assigned to a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha in the 3rd Battalion - Sgt. John Newby. The other had just been reassigned off an Operational Detachment Alpha following a cr iminal Investigation Division matter being levied against him, PFC William Tyree. Tyree was reassigned to a Forward Support Team but had been carried for the preceding month on the 2nd Battalion's roster. 16. Upon the assumption of command, I cr eated and implemented 12 separate Special Action Teams. Their mission was to implement Army Regulation 340-18-5 (file"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 121 number 503-05). My authority for this action came directly from FORSCOM through Edwin Wilson who appeared before me in my office at 10th Special Forces Group Headquarters. This action was taken to develop surveillance of politicians, judicial figures, law enforcement agencies at the State level, an d of religious figures [in conformity with the remit of the A-6 RED MIST program identified by William Colby when he briefed William Casey in 1981 - Ed.] 17. Edwin Wilson explained that it was believed that Operation WATCHTOWER might be compromised and become known if politicians, judicial figures, police and religious entities were approached or received word that U.S. troops had aided in delivering narcotics from Columbia into Panama. Based on that possibility, intense surveillance was now undertaken by my office to ensure that if WATCHTOWER became known about, the U.S. Government and the Army would have advance warning and could prepare a defense [sic]. 18. I was under orders never to inform Colonel Forrest Rittgers, [who was] Com- manding Officer of Ft. Devens. The reason for this order, I was told, was that in the event Ft. Devens personnel were caught in the act of implementing the surveillance, Col. R ittgers will have a margin of plausible deniability w ith which he may be able to downplay and defend against injuries [sic]. 19. The surveillance was unofficially referred to as Operation George Orwell based on the theme of the surveillance and the George Orwell published work '1984'. 20. I instituted surveillance against Te d Kennedy, John Kerry, Edward King, Michael Dukakis [who was later a Vice Pres idential candidate], Levin H. Campbell, Andrew A. Caffey, Fred Johnston, Kenneth A. Chandler, Thomas P. O'Neill [later the House Speaker], to name a few of the targets. Surveillance at my orders was instituted at the Governors' residences of Massachusetts, Maine, New York, and New Hampshire. The Catholic Cathedrals of New York and Boston were placed under electronic surveillance also. In the area of Ft. Devens, all local police and politicians were under surveillance at various times. [In other words, A-6 (or its clone) was being implemented domestically, as well - which was doubly against the law then prevailing - Ed.]. 21. I specifically employed individuals taken from the 441st Military Intelligence Detachment and 402 Army Security Agency Detachment assigned to the 10th Special Forces Group to supplement the Special Action Teams carrying out Operation Orwell. 22. I also recruited a number of local State employees who worked within the ranks of local police and as court personnel to assist in this operation. They were veterans and had previous security clearances. Th ey were told at the out set that if they were ca ught they were on their own. 23. Among the Special Action Team personnel was (then) SP4 William Tyree. Tyree had learned of the Operation and requested in person to be part of it. Tyree was used in less than a dozen surveillances. 24. In October 1978, it became known to me that SP4 Tyree was receiving telephone threats to his wife and himself. He made that fact known to his First Sergeant, Frederick Henry, and then approached me. Following our discussion, I considered placing Tyree under surveillance to arrive at who was behind the threats and whether or not the threats had the potential of compromising Operation Orwell. 25. On 26 December 1978 I began a file on SP 4 Tyree and assigned a three-man sur- veillance Special Action Team to the multi-dwelling apartment complex [that] SP4 Tyree shared with his wife. That unit was in place from that date until 14 February 1979."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"122 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs 26. On 5 January 1979, Tyree app eared before me to receive a Field Grade Article-15 (non-judicial punishment) for his part in the theft and sale of military property. I had to make an example out of Tyree and institut ed the most severe punishment possible. I concluded that with pending Congressional inquiries, the Post Commander (Colonel Rittgers) would reverse my decision on appeal, in Pvt. Tyree's favor. A reason to support this conclusion, in addition to pending C ongressional inquiries, was the fact that the proceedings against Pvt. William Tyree were flawed from the outset of the investigation with a number of discrepancies. 27. I was told and understood that the main reason for seeking the Article-15 against him was to make an example of him, to show others that cooperation with the Command law enforcement agencies was mandatory. 28. On 26 January 1979, Pvt. Tyree tendered his Appeal of my sanction. The Appeal is attached. It is the best example of what proof existed against Pvt. Tyree when he came before me on 5 January 1979. It also names the characters in another matter that was unfolding as of that date. 29. By 29 January 1979, Senator Garn's of fice had contacted the Army Liaison Office in Washington D.C, on behalf of Pvt. Ty ree who referred the matter to my office, as I was Pvt. Tyree's Commanding Officer. I then notified Sgt. Doucette in Washington D.C, that it would be approximately two weeks before further action could be taken in regard to the threats Pvt. Tyree was receiving . At that point I knew the threats were taking place, but had not ascertained from whence they originated. 30. At approximately 0945 hours on 30 January 1979, Pvt. Tyree reported to my office at 10th Special Forces Group Headquarters per my instructions. Pvt. Tyree reported that between 2400 hours and 0 100 hours of the previous night his wife had received another threatening phone call. I was notified of the call by the Special Action Team in place at the Tyree residence prior to speaking with Pvt. Ty ree. I ordered Tyree to keep this matter to himself as it was being investigated. I notified Pvt. Tyree I would contact him between 1200 and 1300 hours at his duty station as soon as I co uld look into a matter that pertained to the threats. This meeting lasted until 1019 hours. 31. On 30 January 1979, at approximately 1147 hours, two men were dropped in the parking area of the apartment complex that Pvt. Tyree resided within. One man was identified as Erik Aarhus. The second man, due to his face being covered, could not be identified as the two men entered the ap artment building wher e the Tyree family resided. Surveillance in dicated that at least one of the two men entered the Tyree apartment and left prior to the arrival of Pvt. William Tyree and his wife at noon. 32. On 30 January 1979, at noon, Pvt. Tyree and his wife were seen arriving at the apartment complex they resided in. Pvt. Tyree never exited his truck and Mrs. Tyree entered the building where their apartment was located. After she disappeared, a car almost ran into Pvt. Tyree as he was leaving the parking lot. Mrs. Tyree was stabbed to death in their apartment shortly thereafter. 33. Following a scream, local police were notified. The first police car responded quickly and a single officer ente red the building where the Tyree family resided. After the officer entered, one of the two men exited from a window on the ground floor of the building This widow was identified as the Tyree bedroom window. The man seen leaving this window was identified as SP4 Earl M. Peters. Peters exited the window wearing blue denim, with a red hood sticking out of the rear neck area of the blue denim jacket. He was carrying a box, green and white in color that was described by the Special"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 123 Action Team as long and flat in appearance. Peters then walked from the building to the driveway entrance of the apar tment complex and walked in the general direction of the main street in Ayer, Massachusetts. Within 5 or 6 minutes after the first police officer arrived, a second officer identifie d as the Police Chief appeared. 34. After the Police Chief had arrived, a third vehicle arrived. This was 10 to 15 minutes later. That vehicle carried an unknown man in his late 30s. He was later identified as the landlord of the Tyree apartment. 35. Upon knowledge that Mrs. Tyree was dead, the Special Action Team did notify me of this fact and I did place Pvt. Tyree under in tense surveillance. In addition, I placed SP4 Peters under surveillance and at approximately 1405 hours during the afternoon of the murder Sp4 Peters signed a weapon (12 gauge shotgun, Remington 1100) into the Service Company. The weapon was in a long flat green and white box bearing the name 'Remington' across the front and back sides. [*Note: The author of the Affidavit says Mrs Tyree was stabbed, but inconsistently stresses Pvt. Peters' gun - Ed.]. 36. Pvt. Tyree was questioned and cooperated in a limited fashion. He was then taken to the 441 Military Intelligence Detachment where he slept overnight on the Commanding Officer's couch, under guard. The following morning, I spoke to him in my office at the 10th Special Forces Group Headquar ters. I informed him of the surveillance and of what I knew had occurred to his wife. He knew at that point that SP4 Peters and Pvt. Aarhus had both been involved in the murder and he began to talk to me. 37. Pvt. Tyree admitted, on 31 January 1979 in my office to me, that his wife had been killed, he felt, because of a set of diaries sh e had kept. Tyree explained that SP4 Peters and SP4 Rosario were named throughout the books as being involved in [certain] illegal matters on and around Ft. Devens. I knew [that] Rosario had been alleged to be involved in such matters and knew the information could be true. Then Pvt. Tyree admitted that his wife knew of Operations WATCHTOW ER and Orwell, as he had seen it in her diaries the previous night. Pvt. Tyree swore he didn't reveal the Operations to her and I believed him. Tyree didn't know where the diaries were at this time. 38. Upon Pvt. Tyree leaving my office, I initiated contact with Massachusetts State Police Lieutenant J. Dwyer, of the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Lt. Dwyer had cooperated previously on Operation Orwell and understood the urgency of the situation. Lt. Dwyer notified me that during a search of the Tyree apartment he [had] discovered the diaries behind the fridge with a note to the family of Elaine Tyree. He did not disclose the contents of the note. 39. Shortly before noon on 2 February 1979, I received a telephone call from Lt. Dwyer indicating he would drop off the diaries belonging to Elaine Tyree at my office. Upon receipt of the diaries I reviewed them , noting [that] much of Operation WATCH- TOWER and Orwell was written about throughout the many pages of the diaries. 40. After my review, I contacted Colonel Moore of the U.S. Army Liaison in Washington D.C., and notified him of the scope of the issues involved in the murder of Elaine Tyree. I did notify him at that time of the possibility that arms and narcotics traf- ficking played a role in her murder. Due to security issues surrounding Operations WATCHTOWER and Orwell, I did not indicate how the arms and narcotics trafficking figured in the murder of Elaine Tyree, however. 41. Despite repeated warnings to stay out of th e investigation and to remain silent, Pvt. Tyree was arrested on 13 February 1979, after [he had] attempted to bring about the arrest of Pvt. Aarhus. The surveillance Special Action Team reported that an armed con-"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"124 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs frontation between Pvt. Tyree and SP4 Peters occurred prior to the a rrest of Pvt. Tyree. 42. During February 1979, Pvt. Tyree was arraigned on the pending civilian criminal charges. It was too risky to allow a military court to review the charges against Pvt. Tyree with Operation Orwell still ongoing and Senator Garn's office requesting a full investigation. Pvt. Tyree therefore had to stand before a civilian court of law on the criminal charges. 43. Prior to the arrest of Pvt. William Tyree, Lt. Dwyer approached me and insisted on knowing whether or not Tyree had ever serv ed in Vietnam. I suspect Lt. Dwyer was attempting to learn if Tyree's involvement in the military operations elsewhere were being covered up the way Operation WATCHTOWER was. I replied in the negative, that Tyree had never been in the Republic of South Vietnam. I then contemplated for the first time [the possibility] that Tyree might go public on Operations WATCH-TOWER and Orwell because I had not come forward. Based on that conclusion, I gave orders to erase certain parts of his military records. 44. Actual information erased included the attendance of Pvt. Tyree at certain service schools and references to overseas service. I ordered all records to be erased that linked Pvt. Tyree to Operation WATCHTOWER or Orwell. Service schools and badges [that] I know were erased included his Taper Flash Special Forces Qualification', 'Crewman's Aviator Wings', 'Canadian Airbor ne Badge', and 'Master Parachute Badge'. I also gave orders to disenfranchise Pvt. Tyre e from [the] Special Forces. I wanted no-one standing up for him and in the process dragging the information concerning Operation WATCHTOWER into the public eye. [Note: And to hell with poor Pvt. Tyree, whose wife had just been murdered because she knew about the US military's illegal drug-running operations, and who had himself been arrested after confronting his wife's murderer - Ed.]. 45. Unknown to him, Pvt. Tyree underwent a hearing on the criminal charges in a local courthouse, under the su rveillance of Operation Orwell. I learned through trans- missions that Tyree only spok e of defense issues with his attorney, but [had] never men- tioned Operations WATCHTOWER or Orwell. In the process of Pvt. Tyree's hearing, a State police officer from Lt. Dwyer's office discovered [that] the State courthouse was under surveillance. This led to the arrest of the senior Court Officer, Ira Kiezer, who took full responsibility and never mentioned my office. 46. After the hearing concluded, the presid ing judge in the Tyree matter found no reason to bind Tyree over for the trial on the mu rder of his wife. I found myself faced with the possibility that Pvt. Tyree, upon release, would become angered at my decision to disfranchise him. So I approached Lt. Dwyer who informed me that an indictment had already been secured for Tyree and that he wo uld stand trial for the charge of murder. Lt. Dwyer expressed concern that there would not be enough evidence to warrant a guilty finding against Tyree. Lt. Dwyer indicated that the only person with enough credibility was SP4 Peters. I could not inform Lt. Dwyer that Peters had been the person responsible for Elaine Tyree's murder. 47. After weeks of consideration, I conclu ded that the security of Operation WATCHTOWER and Orwell came first and AR 340-18-5 strictly prohibited the disclosure of intelligence gathered pursuant to that regulation. 48. On 29 February 1980, Pvt. Tyree was convicted of murder and will spend the duration of his life incarcerated. I could no t disseminate intelligence gathered under Operation Orwell to notify civilian authorities who actually killed Elaine Tyree. [Note: For illegal operational reasons, including the need to cover up US drug-running, therefore,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 125 an army private (named as a Colonel in the court documents to which Casey's Affidavit was appended, but as 'Private' in Cutolo's Affidavit) faced spending the rest of his life in jail for murdering his wife, even though his Commanding Officer knew who had actually committed the murder (false witness). The Author's enquiries have indicated that the unfortunate Pvt. Tyree is still incarcerated (as of June 2006). - Ed.]. 49. The current intelligence on Archbishop Romero (El Salvador) indicates [that] he is in receipt of physical evidence supporting seve ral allegations that the United States is currently, [along] with Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panama, covertly training and sponsoring freedom fighters attempting to overthrow the current regime in Nicaragua; that these freedom fighters are also being supported from funds arising from Operation WATCHTOWER in part; that Mr. Robert D'Aubuisson (El Salvador) secretly aided the freedom fighters by allowing US advisors to train the freedom fighters inside El Salvador; [and] that Sr. D'Aubuisson was contacted by Edwin Wilson and Frank Terpil prior to the freedom fighters being trained inside El Salvador. This information made it necessary to protect Operation WATCHTOWER and Orwell regardless of the costs [i.e., regardless of th e murder of Pvt. Tyree's wife by someone other than her husband and regardless of the fact that th is US military officer or soldier was languishing in prison, where he faced spending the rest of his life - Ed.]. 50. I have been in communication with Lt. Dwyer. In November 1979, after some prodding, Lt. Dwyer and the Middlesex Distri ct Attorney went to the Massachusetts Supreme Court and obtained a ruling that prohibits any court but the Massachusetts Supreme Court from ordering the arrest of susp ects in the Tyree murder. I am told that this is without precedent and that normally any court can issue arrest warrants for suspects in a murder. This will ensure that only Tyree and Aarhus are arrested for the murder and that SP4 Peters will not have to be subjected to having to defend himself on the witness stand. That also could bring about the entire matter being made public as by this time, I am certain that SP4 Peters is acutely aware that something is afoot, or he would have been arrested when the hearing in the local courthouse was held. [Another instance of the perversion of the US system of 'justice' by intelligence - Ed.]. 51. I mailed the diaries of Elaine Tyree to a post office box number in Langley, Virginia, per instructions of Edwin Wilson who contacted me by telephone concerning the diaries [i.e., the diaries were sent to the CIA, where of course they have been suppressed - Ed.]. Wilson also notified me of the intelligence on Archbishop Romero. 52. I reviewed the diaries prior to mailing them. The diaries contained most of the information on SP4 Peters, as Pvt. Tyree indi cated they did. I susp ect that this was the motive for Peters' killing of Elaine Tyree. The diaries contained no mention of Pvt. Tyree or his alleged illegal dealings. I suspect that Elaine Tyree only wrote in the diaries relating to soldiers other than her husband, who were involved in illegal activities in and around Ft. Devens. 53. The diaries kept by Elaine Tyree mentioned certain personal entries that can corroborate the fact that I saw the diaries, that they exist, and that the information contained within them is accurate. There were numerous entries relating to Elaine Hebb Tyree's family located in Maryland, and her friends in the army. 54. January 1978 entry: 'Rosemary got a job with the FBI and has to be in Wash- ington D.C. by January 31, 1978. Cindy and Edie got out of the hospital today (that is, Thursday)'. 55. From reading the entry on Cindy and Edie I suspect that [the] actual date of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"126 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs their release from the hospital was 12 January 1978. But no specific date was given, nor was the hospital named that they were admitted to. 56. January 1978 entry: 'Rosemary will be leaving for Washington D.C., on Sunday. I may ride back with her'. 57. From reading the entry concerning Rosemar y driving to Washington, I suspect the actual date Rosemary left the Hebb family home in Cumberland, Maryland, to travel to Washington, possibly with Elaine Tyree, was 29 January 1978. No actual date was given in the diaries, nor was there further mention whether or not Elaine Tyree actually rode 'back with her.' 58. November 1978 entry: 'SP5 Scott had a little baby girl. She was due in July. I remember her back before she came to Ft. Devens'. 59. From a reading of the entries on SP5 Scott which begin to appear in the diaries around April 1978, I suspect this female wa s a member of a unit Elaine Tyree was assigned to either at Ft. Lee, Virginia, or at Ft. McClellan, Alabama. In either case, this is an intimate fact obviously known only to Elai ne Tyree, as no one else would need any knowledge about when another female friend gave birth, and the gender of the baby born to the female friend in question. 60. January-February 1978 entries. 'I've been running around with Heidi Urban. We go all over together when I don't have duty.... Pat Imbu left in mid-January'. 61. From my reading of the entries on Heidi Urban, the main facts appearing obvious are that Elaine Tyree is then at Ft. Lee, Virginia [and] that Pvt. William Tyree is not present as he is at Ft. Devens, Mass. Other than El aine and Heidi, no-one, specifically not Pvt. Tyree or myself, could know that Elaine and Heidi were 'running around together' at that time, unless these facts are represented in the diaries maintained by Elaine Tyree in her own handwriting. Elaine Tyree was [now] assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, Quartermaster School. 62. November 1978 entry: 'Dear Diary, my br other Steven who has been stationed in England for a over a year, is coming home on the 20th for good'. 63. From reading the entries on Steven, I learned that he is currently assigned to an Air Force Base in England and that Elaine Tyree got along well with him. 64. From further consideration and reading en tries on SP5 Scott. I conclude that Mrs Elaine Tyree knew this female at Ft. Lee, Virginia, in the sense that both Scott and Elaine Tyree underwent the same training there. I don 't gather from the entries that SP5 Scott married or had a name change between her duty at Ft. Lee, Virginia, and Ft. Devens, Mass., but I could be forgetting or overlo oking the numerous personal entries in the diaries in an attempt only to view data pertinent to Operation WATCHTOWER or Orwell. 65. November 1978 entry: 'Peters came by th e apartment today. Bill spoke with him in the front room while I was washing dishes. Peters is thinking about buying a new truck. Bill asked Peters if he was going to have Dennis Testagrossa steal this new truck and burn it so [that] Peters could collect the insurance the way Peters had the last time? Peters laughed and said the payments are better on this truck than the one he had Testagrossa steal from the parking lot of Carlin's Bar. This was the first I knew that Peters was involved in the stealing of his own truck. Peters told me [that] Bill was not involved because at the time Bill was under too much attention'. 66. I have not seen proof that Pvt. Tyree was involved in illegal activities. I have seen ample proof that he is foolish and eager to do things his way, since Pvt. Tyree's involvement in the March 1976 WATCHTOWER incident with the 40-50 armed Colombians."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 127 67.

I have seen other men involved in Operation WATCHTOWER meet accidental deaths af ter they had also been threatened. 68. Sgt.

It was at that time that (then) SP4 Tyree began to report threatening phone calls. I saw a pattern and still believe that a pattern exists.

I believe [that] the friends I have entrus ted with the original and copies of this affidavit will place the national security of th e United States and American interests in Latin America first, and if circumstances allow, will bring this affidavit to the attention of the authorities in the event that something occurs to me. 71. During the conversation with Edwin Wilson, I was informed of the sensitive data related to Archbishop Romero. He also spoke to me concerning operation WATCH-TOWER and the geopolitical climate in Latin America and the need to maintain security. I notified him that I had requested to release intelligence gathered from Operation Orwell to civilian police authorities involved in the Elaine Tyree murder and that the Staff Judge Advocate's Office had denied the request. 72. Edwin Wilson [then] explained that Operation WATCHTOWER had to remain secret and gave these reasons [for his demand]: (1) If the operation became public knowle dge, it would undermine present gov- ernmental interests as well as those in the future; (2) There are similar operations being implemented elsewhere in the world. Wilson named the 'Golden Triangle' of Southeast Asia and [also] Pakistan [in this context]. Wilson stated [that] in both areas of the world, the CIA and certain other intelligence agencies are using the illegal narcotics flow to support forces fighting to overthrow Communist governments, or [else] governments that are not friendly towards the United States. Edwin Wilson revealed [the names of] several recognized officials [from] Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Korea, Thailand and Cambodia as being aware of and consenting to these arrangements, similar to the arrangements in Panama; (3) Wilson cited the military coup in Argentina in 1976, the coup in Peru in 1976, the collapse of the Somoza Government in Nicaragua in 1979, and the growing civil war in El Salvador as examples of the need for oper ations like WATCHTOWER, as these operations funded the ongoing US effort to combat Communism and [to] defeat various activities directed against the United States or matters concerning the United States. 73. Edwin Wilson [then] explained that the profits from the sale of narcotics were laundered through a series of banks. Wilson stated that over 70% of the profits were being laundered through the banks in Panama. The remaining percentage was"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"128 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs being funnelled through Swiss banks with only a modest remainder being handled by banks within the United States. Wils on indicated that a large proportion of the profits are brought into the banks of Panama without being checked. I understood that some of the dollar profits in Panamanian banks arrived through Israeli couriers. I became aware of that fact from normal co nversations with some of the Embassy per- sonnel assigned to the Embassy in Panama. Wilson also stated that an associate whom I don't know also aided in overseeing the launde ring of funds, which were then used to purchase weapons to arm the various factions that the CIA saw as friendly towards the United States. The associate's name is Tom C lines. Wilson indicated that most of [the activity under] Operation WATCHTOWER w as effected on the authority of Clines. 74. I was notified by Mr Edwin Wilson that the information forwarded to Washington D.C., was disseminated to private corporations that were developing weapons for the US Department of Defense. Those private corporations were encouraged to use the sensitive information gathered from the surveillance on US Senators and Representatives as leverage [with which] to manipulate those Congressmen into approving whatever costs the weapons systems incurred. [Note: This is a formal, explicit acknowledgement of the widespread use of blackmail by the US intelligence community as an instrument of domestic and international military policy. - Ed.]. 75. Edwin Wilson named three weapons systems when he spoke of private cor- porations receiving information [that was derived] from Operation Orwell: (1) An armored vehicle; (2) An aircraft that is invisible to radar; (3) A weapons system that utilizes kinetic energy. I got the impression [that] this weapon was being developed either for use by NASA or for CBR [sic] purposes. I wrote down what I recalled at the time and it is attached [omitted by the source for this presentation as being not strictly relevant, as was certain other related material - Ed]. 76. Edwin Wilson indicated to me during our conversation which entailed the dis- semination of Operation Orwell information a nd the identification of the three weapons systems, that Operation Orwell would be implemented nationwide by 4th July 1980. [Accordingly]: 77. As of the date of this affidavit, 8,400 US police departments, 1,370 churches, and approximately 17,900 citizens have been monitored under Operation Orwell. The major churches targeted have been Catholic and Latter-Day Saints [sic]. I have stored certain information [that was] gathered by Opera tion Orwell on Ft. Devens, and pursuant to instructions from Edwin Wilson have forwar ded additional information gathered, to Washington, D.C. [Note: At that time, the CIA was prohibited from spying on US citizens domestically: but what the hell, the law is only there to be exploited when the intelligence community needs its protection: at all other times, it can be disregarded - Ed.]. 78. Per orders from Edwin Wilson, I did not discuss the implementation of Operation Orwell with my staff or others outside beyond the personnel assigned to surveillance. The only matter [that was] discussed with Operation Orwell personnel was what the Special Action Teams needed to know in order to ca rry out their mission. Ce rtain information was collected on suspected members of the Trilateral Commission and also the Bilderberg Group. [Note: This formal documented admissi on is extremely significant. The Author is advised by reliable intelligence sources that the Trilateral Commission is a subversive front for German long-range 'Black' Intelligence, while the Bilderberg Organisation allegedly selects and approves personnel and Illuminati"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 129 agentur in order to ensure that the interests and objectives of the Illuminati, serving ultimately, as a practical matter, German long-range global hegemony strategy, are always sustained - Ed.]. Among those that information was collected on were Gerald Ford and President Jimmy Carter. Edwin Wilson indicated that additional surveillance was implemented against the former CIA Director George H. W. Bush. Sr., whom Edwin Wilson named as a member of the Trilateral Commission. [This statement confirms that Operation Orwell was directed domestically against the long-range German/DVD Fifth Column in the United States - Ed.]. [Mr Cutolo added]: I do not have personal knowledge that Ford, Carter or Bush were under surveillance. 79. I spoke to Colonel James N. Rowe on 5 March 1980. I specifically requested that Col. Rowe communicate with several contacts he possesses within the CIA. I requested Colonel Rowe to check out Mr Edwin Wilson. I had two concerns. The first was that Edwin Wilson may pose a threat to national security by disseminating classified information on the CIA's activities to personnel without a clearance or a need to know that information. Edwin Wilson, during his conversations with me, outlined information that was classified and which I had no need to know: information that pertained to the activities of the CIA in the United States and Latin Americ a. I've related such conversations with Mr Wilson herein. The second concern I had was the issue of his authority and [of his] connection to Thomas Clines. I was told repeatedly that Clines was the agent in charge and that Wilson worked with Clines. Colonel Rowe indicated that he would make the inquiries I requested and would contact me with that information as soon as he had something. Colonel Rowe indicated that it would be 60 to 90 days before he would speak to the CIA contact that was most apt to have knowledge of the information I requested. I agreed to meet Colonel Rowe at Ft. Bragg the next week in June in the event Colonel Rowe received documentation relating to the information I sought. 80. On 7 March 1980, Colonel Rowe contacted me. During the course of our con- versation Colonel Rowe informed me that hi s initial inquiries with CIA contacts confirmed that Edwin Wilson was working for Thomas Clines at the times in question. Colonel Rowe indicated that Edwin Wilson was under scrutiny by the CIA at that time but had not been given the details of the circumstances su rrounding the events of that matter. Colonel Rowe also indicated that there was an Israeli aspect to the matter involving Edwin Wilson, and Colonel Rowe provided the name of David Kimche as being the Israeli most likely to be involved with Edwin Wilson. [Note: David Kirnche was head of the Israeli Fo reign Office and therefore in charge of Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence service. He was the mo st powerful and most senior of all Israeli foreign and intelligence officials. For David Kirnche to have been involved in such operational matters meant that Israeli intelligence is heavily involved in drug-trafficking operations, too, as is confirmed shortly. Indeed, as will be seen, the Israeli drug operations in Latin America (and elsewhere) are extensive (and may be intertwined with parallel Soviet drug-trafficking operations - Ed.]. With regard to my concerns that Edwin Wilson posed a possible threat to national security or to the inner working of the CIA, Colonel Rowe indicated that off the record, that was a concern of several people to whom he had also spoken. Colonel Rowe further indicated that he woul d be in receipt of documentation by the first week of June [1980] which listed Edwin Wilson's involvement in several operations. I specifically asked Colonel Rowe if he had the names of any of those operations at this time and his reply was in the negative. Colonel Rowe did indicate that it was his understanding that each operation had basically the same characters involved,"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"130 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs and Colonel Rowe named two other individuals involved with Edwin Wilson. Colonel Rowe named Robert Gates and William J. Case y as officials who had been named in the documentation he would acquire prior to our scheduled meeting in June 1980 81. On 7 March 1980, after my conversation with Colonel Rowe, I made [some] inquiries through Paul Neri and Pentagon contacts and was informed that David Kimche had ties with the Israeli Intelligence Agency known as 'The Mossad'. I also asked that I be provided a photograph, if any existed, of David Kimche. I requested such a photograph to determine if Mr Kimche was the unidentified male Israeli national who met the aircraft flying into Albrook Air Station during Operation WATCHTOWER. In addition, I sought whatever photographs existed on th ose who were known associates of David Kimche for the same reason. 82. During March 1980 I received three phot ographs from Army Intelligence contacts at the Pentagon. Amongst the three photographs were two indivi duals I recognized. David Kimche's photograph had been shown to me by a friend, Col. Robert Bayard, shortly prior to his murder in Atlanta, Georgi a, in 1977. According to Bayard, Kimche was due to meet with him later. Shortly thereafter, I was informed through the normal lines of communication that Col. Bayard was murdered . As of this date his murder remains unsolved. The photograph of Kimche that Colo nel Bayard had produced appeared to be a surveillance photo. There is no doubt that Kimche was the person Bayard named as being in the photograph. According to Colonel Bayard, Kimche was due to meet with him to discuss a matter that related to Col. Bayard's previous duty in the U.S. Army and assignment in the CIA. 83. The second individual I recognized from the three photographs I received, was listed as Michael Harari. I was informed that Michael Harari is listed as a senior Mossad agent. Harari was the unidentified male Israeli national that met the aircraft which flew into Albrook Air Station during Operation WATCHT OWER. He was the one who gave Edwin Wilson two briefcases full of U.S. currency in various denominations. The briefcases were given to Edwin Wilson at the end of the oper ation in February and March 1976. It is my understanding from Pentagon contacts, that Harari's activities in Latin America are well known, including his drug trafficking endea vors. I was also informed from those same contacts that the Pentagon, on the orders of several Washington VIPs, have gone to great lengths to keep the activities of Harari a secret . I have begun preparations to meet with David Kimche or Michael Harari while in Europe on annual NATO exercises. I intend to verify that Harari was the individual who gave Edwin Wilson the briefcases while at Albrook Air Station during Operation WATCHTOWER. 84. I was informed from Penta gon contacts, off the record, that CIA Director Stansfield Turner and former CI A Director George Bush are among the VIPs that shield Harari from public scrutiny. Those Pentagon contacts further indicated to me their knowledge that Operation WATCHTOWER was implemen ted and of my involvement in that operation. This was the first time that U.S. mi litary authorities confirmed to me that the Operation occurred and gave their approval. I also learned that Mr Harari was a known middleman for certain matters involving the United States inside Latin America. Harari acted with the support of a large network of Mossad personnel throughout Latin America and worked mainly in the import and e xport of arms and drug trafficking. 85. As a further means of corroborating this affidavit, on 9 February 1979, I spoke to Colonel Rittgers concerning the release of Pvt. Tyree from Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C., where he had been admitted on 5 February 1979. Colonel"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 131 Rittgers notified me that Pvt. Tyree had fully recovered from the depression, which was brought about by the murder of Mrs Elaine Tyree. Colonel Rittgers indicated that upon arrival at Ft. Devens later that day, he would interview Pvt. Tyree to determine for himself if Pvt.. Tyree felt he was in any real danger. 86. I also spoke to Captain Gruden who was then the Commanding Officer of the 409th Army Security Agency Company, based in Augsberg, Germany. The telephone call was brief and I inquired into what information PFC Tina Gregory might be expected to give in support of Pvt. Tyree's trial defense. The surveillance of the civilian court house in the early stages of the criminal proceedings ag ainst Pvt. Tyree indicated PFC Gregory could have knowledge about Operation WATCHTOWER since PFC Gregory and Mrs Elaine Tyree were very close friends. I was not able to learn much from Captain Gruden who was leaving his office when I called. In order not to attract attention to the value of the information PFC Gregory may or may not have, I passed the entire phone call off as my being interested about the fate of Pvt. Tyree who was under my command. Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury on this 11th day of March 1980. Edward P. Cutolo Colonel Infantry Commanding'. [Since deceased]. • • • THE AFFIDAVIT OF THE LATE US ARMY COLONEL EDWIN WILSON* Edwin Wilson, a retired US Army Colonel who - like so many others involved in the nexus of operations generically known as Iran-Contra, died under mysterious circumstances (in November 1996) - certified in his own Affidavit, parts of which have been made available to this Author, that 'Mr Tyree had been decorated in relation to the classified operations he participated in. Following the participation of Mr Tyree in the WATCHTOWER operation, he was called upon to serve his country in a variety of classified operations in Latin America, Africa and Pakistan. Our investigation [conducted by Colonel Wilson as an Army M ilitary Intelligence (MI) officer into the William Tyree case - Ed.] found that these subsequent operations came under the general project referred to as SANDMAN. SANDMAN was a project of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). SANDMAN also involved soldiers of the United States military. The information a bout SANDMAN is limited. SANDMAN exclusively dealt with so-called \"wet operations\" (assassinations) and Mr Tyree was involved in several assassinations that were verified by Special Forces soldiers we interviewed. This resulted in Mr Tyree receiving a variety of decorations, which the US Army refuses to admit were ever awarded to Mr Tyree'. The late Colonel Wilson's Affidavit also revealed that Wilson had 'gone back to source', i.e. had interviewed W illiam Colby: 'Ironically during conversations I had with Mr Colby, I learned that he had personally requested and attained [that] a waiver be given to soldiers involved in WATCHTOWER and SANDMAN. One of those soldiers was Mr Tyree. From my involvement in the CIA Program MK-ULTRA' - the true meaning of which acronym Colonel Wilson now divulged - 'Manufacturing Killers Utilizing Lethal Tradecraft Requiring Assassination, I was aware that waivers could be given in regards [sic] to meritorious action during the course of intelligence related operations'. *The Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair, November 1987 [House Report # 100-433/Senate Report #100-216] states, in Chapter 21, on page 327, that General Richard Secord, overall controller of 'the Enterprise... the group of offshore companies that carried out the Iran and Contra operations', was introduced to Edwin Wilson, a former [sic!] CIA office r who had become enormously successful in international business dealings'. Note 18 appended on page 329 of the Report and referring to t his statement adds: The principal source of Wilson's wealth turned out to be arms deals. During 1983, Wilson was convicted of consp iring to sell arms and explosives to Libya as well as of conspiring to murder the Federal Prosecutor and six witnesses in his trial' [information based upon reports in The Washington Post, 14th March 1983, page A17; and the same newspaper, 10th January 1984, page A4]."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"132 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Executive Order 12333 was signed by President R eagan almost as soon as he had settled in at the White House in 1981. The inspiration for this crucial Executive Order has been exposed in a lawsuit brough t (unsuccessfully, as of 2006) by the aforementioned Green Beret William Tyree (the subject of the foregoing Affidavit sworn by the late Colonel Cutolo) who had languished in jail for 23 years (by the summer of 2006) for a crime he did not commit (the murder of his wife Elaine, who kept a diary in which details of CIA and DIA drug-running connections were described) a nd who is the main subject, as indicated, of the preceding Affidavit by Colonel Edward P. Cutolo. The American investigative au thor Rodney Stich has explained the context of this Affidavit in his book Defrauding America 35 : The CIA utilized the Army Intelligence Agency in Operation WATCHTOWER, which began in the mid-1970s. US Colonel A. J. Baker was ordered to oversee part of Operation WATCHTOWER and turned the operation over to Colonel Edward P. Cuto lo, who also commanded the 10th Special Forces based at Fort Devens, Massachusetts'. Lawsuits are typically a source of revelations and exposures of criminal intelligence operations in the United States: by contrast, in Britain, detailed information about intelligence criminalism as, for instance, might have been revealed in the course of the lengthy trial proceedings concerning the defunct, corrupt intelligence in stitution Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) that were conc luded in London in 2006, tend to be less readily obtainable. That institution, a mone y-laundering conduit used for international organised criminal chug-running and terror ism money-laundering operations, was closed down by US intelligence - having originally, in 1972, been partially established by Bank of America, allegedly a US intelligence bank, which originally bought shares in BCCI, before selling them off quietly into the market ten years later. Rodney Stich's observations continued: '[Cutolo] who had been ordered by the CI A to supervise Operation WATCH-TOWER, grew increasingly concerned about its flagrant illegality and conducted an investigation in an attempt to bring it to a halt.... Fearing that he might be killed because of the investigation, he prepared a fifteen-page single-spaced Affidavit dated March 11, 1980 [actually, 8th - Ed.] describing the CIA drug-trafficking and other activities.... Cutolo was [duly, as he had anticipated - Ed.] killed, as were several other people wo rking with him to expose the drug-trafficking operations.... The Affidavit exposed the in stallation and operation of the radio beacon towers [for the guidance of aircraft bringing in drugs] and several of the drug flights in which he participated'. 'The Cutolo Affidavit described the killi ng of an Army servicewoman, Mrs Elaine Tyree, who had knowledge of Operation WATCHTOWER which she described in her diary. To shift attention from the actual kill er and his connection to the ongoing drug operation, the military charged [Elaine] Tyree's husband with the killing. \"It was too risky to allow a military court to review the charges against Pvt. Tyree\", read the Affidavit'. Rodney Stitch's explanatory narrative about this Illuminati murd er continued: 'At the first military hearing, the presiding judge found no reason to bind Tyree's husband over for trial for the murder of his wife. This decision risked further investigation and possible exposure of the corrupt operation. Army pressure caused the county prosecutor to indict the husband for murdering his wife even though the Army knew [that] the actual killer was someone else. [False witness and the perversion of justice - Ed.]. The Cutolo Affidavit stated: \"On 29 February 1980, Pvt. Tyree was convicted of murder and will spend the duration of his life incarcerated [as has indeed so far been the case - Ed.]."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 133 I could not disseminate intelligence gathered under Operation Orwell [a surveillance operation directed against US politicians and others] to notify civilian authorities [as to] who actually killed Elaine Tyree\"'. Clandestine intelligence operations involving such egregious serial illegality have to be covered up by ever more desperate lies, false witness and murder. But has anyone in authority taken this on board? It is to be doubted. WILLIAM TYREE'S WRONGFUL IMPRIS ONMENT LAWSUIT AND AFFIDAVIT It is from Pvt. Tyree's own lawsuit against the CI A et al., a so far vain attempt to procure his release, that 'further and better particulars' about how the US intelligence community was self- sucked irretrievably into the sewer of Latin American drug-running, and why this happened, has been obtained. The late William Casey's own Affidavit, the text of which has been cited, locks all these revelations into place, leaving zero doubt that the CIA's penchant for drug-running has been exploited (as will be seen) by the Illumina ti, which finances its operations inter alia precisely from such activity. And as this book argues and demonstrates, the Illuminati, spawned in its modern from from Germany, is a global instrument of covert German Nazi (Himmlerian) world hegemony strategy. The Author knows for certain that American intelligence has itself been double- crossed, since, as has been explained, one of its most distinguished and effective operatives informed him specifically on 9th June 2005, in response to the Author's comment that 'these are ultimately operations of the Illuminati': 'Yes, but we didn't know that, at the time'. Given the Author's knowledge of and relationship with the source concerned, he is certain that this statement is accurate. It opens the lid on the possibility (which the Author believes to be a certainty) that rogue Illuminati forces workin g within and manipulating elements of the US intelligence community have systematically exploited its corruption and weaknesses in pursuit of an Illuminised agenda that diverges sharply from the interests of the United States (however misconceived in the first place) and its misled and largely innocent population. William Tyree's lawsuit has been described by one intelligence operative turned historian as 'a work of art, a masterpiece of legal reasoning and an important historical source document' 36 . It began by questioning the legality of all Executive Orders and similar 'decrees' issued by US Presidents - which form a parallel body of 'law' promulgated independently of the Executive and Judicial Branches of the Federal Government. All attempts to question the legality of these unilateral presidential decrees have so far failed. Tyree's lawsuit pointed out that Executive Order 12333 authorised 'the privatisation of intelligence and covert operations and permitted agencies other than the CIA to conduct 'Special Activities', thus effectively opening the door, previously closed by the National Security Act of 1947 et seq., to the White House National Security Council Staff or even private entities/assets, i.e. third party cutouts, to carry out covert operations'. Uri Dowbenko has written that 'in plain language, this means that the CIA could subcontract or \"farm out\" their drug-smuggling and assassinations to third party personnel and continue to enjoy their \"plausible deniability\", i.e., denying any knowledge or involvement with criminal activities' 37 . Permission to lie about the inte lligence provenance of so-called Title 18, Section 6 US Government (intelligence) corporations was specifically provided for in the text of Executive Order 12333. But while these people flout the law all the time, they also use it to crucify those they discard. The 101-page Complaint or lawsuit dated September 1998, claiming $63 million on behalf of his client - filed by Ray Kohlman, the lawyer who was the Attorney of Record"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"134 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs in respect of William Casey's Affidavit, the pre -filed text of which has been cited above, and whom the Author found (in June 2005) had 'vanished' from his Massachusetts office address - states that William Tyree was falsely imprisoned in the context of the theft of diaries kept by his murdered wife Elaine, which contain evidence that would have exonerated him and exposed the false witness against him at his trial. Tyree had married Elaine on 31st December 1977. As Uri Dowbenko explained, 'she was an avid diarist who had been keeping deta iled notes on all the illegal activities she was observing' 38 . Kohlman's apparent disappearance from his Massachusetts office, is either a precaution for his own safety following his action in filing the lawsuit (Case Number 98CV11829JLT), or else indicative of the possibility that he, too, has been liquidated, 'suicided', compromised or otherwise di sposed of, along with the 450+ operatives, lawyers and others whose connections with Tran-Contra' have proved their undoing or worse. The Complaint exposed not only deta iled information about CIA drug-running and money-laundering operations, but also that the so-called Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - a shadowy an d seemingly unconstitutional entity which has the power to suspend the US Constitution and to usurp the power of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches of the US Federal Government - was established independently of Congress, using the vast pr ofits from CIA drug-traffi cking. The lawsuit, accompanied by numerous Affidavits and appendices, named the Central Intelligence Agency, former CIA Director and President George Bush Sr., and the self-admitted official assassin D. Gene Tatum, as defendants 'in the far-reaching case i nvolving US Government sanctioned drug smuggling, murder and cover-up' 39 . ENTER A U.S. ARMY COLONEL AND MAFIA-CONNECTED MONEY-LAUNDERER William Tyree's Complaint and lawsuit contains first-hand details and revelations of these nefarious (Illuminati) activities, by US Army Colonel Al Carone, who, as we have seen, was identified by William Casey in his (cited) Affidavit - details which, 'corroborated with evidence from other sources, reveals a dark history of the United States that has been neglected by mainstream historians' 40 and censored by the American media, which CIA cadres have openly boasted of being under the thumb and control of the Agency 41 . Indeed the same cadres made it clear, in the course of a lecture attended by one of the Author's contacts, that the general public has no right to know 'the truth', and that the only class entitled to know what is really happ ening is the intelligence community. This is because the intelligence community, ignoring all le gality, is engaged in organised criminal activities going far beyond its remit, which it seek s to hide from the ge neral public, not least because many of these evil activit ies are designed to ensure the intelligence community's independence from its only legal source of funding - the US C ongress. By developing 'off-balance sheet' financial resources such as the financial pipelines generated by hypothecation and global drug-dealing, the US intelligence community has accumulated unfettered power, which it exercises over both the Executive and Legislative Branches of Government in its own, rather than the Republic's, interests. The Tyree lawsuit cites at length from information provided by Colonel Carone -who himself died in on 7th January 1990, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, obviously of an induced CIA cancer, as his medical records stated that he perished due to 'chemical toxicity of unknown etiology'. Carone was 'a CIA paymaster and a Mafia-connected money-la underer [see William Casey's Affidavit - Ed.], who incidentally held the rank of full Colonel in Army Intelligence. As Colonel Oliver North's bagman, he also couri-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 135 ered large amounts of cash in and out of the country' 42 . Carone was, however, ordered to perform these and related functions directly by the Director of Central Intelligence, William Casey, himself. And Casey was, as he himself acknowledged in his Affidavit, simply continuing clandestine operations that had been in train for many years prev- iously, and which William Colby was still running, without the knowledge of the US President, Congress or even (as he affirmed ) the US intelligence community itself, many years after he had ceased himself to be DCI. Rodney Stich, as well informed on these matters as Uri Dowbenko, elaborated in his book 'Defrauding America' that 'Carone had complex relationships'. [He] 'was a member of the Gambino [Mafia] family', although as Casey' s Affidavit text revealed, he was 'co-opted' into the Gambino family, the Author suggests, for operational intelligence reasons. Carone had 'connections to other crime groups in the eastern part of the United States' and was 'a detective on the New York vice squad, a member of the military and a CIA operative' 43 - an all-round criminalist intelligence officer, in fact. Colonel Carone's evidence, incorporated in William Tyree's massive Complaint, continued: 'Once Ronald Reagan became President, his old-time friend William Casey, the head of the CIA, was able to convince him to sign Executive Order 12333 into effect... which took the CIA out of [the] covert operations business... authorized the use of private assets/entities to be used by the National Security Council to conduct covert operations including the drug [smuggling]... Allowing private assets and entities to do the dirty work meant [that] the CIA could do whatever it wanted to do, in or out of the United States...'. Of course, the CIA has always effectively been in that position; but there is no doubt that Executive Order 12333 'essentially privatised the CIA's drug-smuggling, making the Agency even more insulated from disc overy of its criminal activities' 44 - or so, for a time, it was officially assumed. 'You had National Security Council staffers that were tied right into drug-trafficking themselves, like Ollie North. Hell, his diary had everything in it. Between his diary and your wife's [Elaine's] diaries, the whole thing is blown. Totally compromised', Carone reported to Tyree 45 . This special, Mafia-linked source in whom William Casey had placed so much trust at the outset of this di sastrous series of ma nipulated misadventures, revealed the depths to which US intelligence had sunk - only to die suddenly, like so many other Iran-Contra whistleblowers. And as Carone further informed William Tyree, he 'had delivered [drug] money to the gangs because they were on the CIA payroll under Executive Order 12333, which allowed the CIA to hire outside sources to help the CIA perform their jobs' [as Carone, with his blinkered operative's vision, saw the situation - Ed.]. 'He had delivered money to the gangs because they tr ansported the drugs across the United States, i.e., Atlanta, Norfolk, Philadelphia, New York and Boston'. CIA/DVD drugs, that is. Colonel Carone also fingered George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton as CIA operatives, not that these facts are anything new: the point is that Colonel Carone's Affidavit explicitly confirmed them: 'George Bush was CIA prior to the assassination of John Kennedy in 1963' and 'the Governor of Arkansas that looked the other way at Mena, Bill Clinton, was CIA back in the late 1960s'. Mena Airport was the CIA's drug transhipment airport, to which aircraft laden with cocaine flew in undetected (the Author uses th e past tense only because later information is not available), assisted by the blinding by National Security Agency and Army Security Agency personnel of US early warning satelli tes and radar installations (Operations SEA SPRAY and JADE BRIDGE)."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"136 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Carone further informed William Tyree, accord ing to Tyree's Affidavit, that 'he had taken money to a female named Ruth Paine in late 1956 on orders from William Casey', an OSS- CIA operative as he states in his own Affida vit. Carone said that Paine was approached by the CIA to find and recruit an individual that was expendable [and] with Communist ties and some type of anti-American background.... Carone said that when Ruth Paine found the individual, she notified her CIA contact, identif ied as George De Mohrenschildt, who in turn contacted his CIA supervisor, identified as George Bush. Carone said that George Bush was the same George Bush that was CIA Director [sic]. Carone said the individual located by Ruth Paine was identified as a Mr Lee Harvey Oswald. FBI records/reports filed within 14 days after the assassination of President Kennedy will reflect that Mr George Bush met with J Edgar Hoover, as Bush was trying to ascertain what the FBI might have stumbled onto by mistake in regards to the Ruth Paine-Oswald connection'. These comments allude to the alleged involvement of German 'Black'intelligence in Kennedy's assassination. The late Colonel Carone's sworn testimony, replicated in William Tyree's Complaint, which sheds such detailed light on the consequences of William Casey's controversial decisions - all justified, as Casey's Affidavit itself reveals, by what Uri Dowbenko described (aptly, in view of what follows in Chapter 6 on the Jesuits) as 'Jesuit casuistry' - revealed that Carone 'was a paymaster for both US Milit ary Intelligence personnel and CIA personnel when Tyree knew and worked with him. He also worked as a representative of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International [BCCI] which he stated was a bank founded by the US Intelligence Community in part to finance covert (Black) Operations worldwide without the approval of Congress'. BCCI was closed down by US intelligence - after the bank's nefarious criminalist intelligence activities began to be exposed. Immediately ahead of its closure, the bank actually possessed assets of $17.0 billion, and liabilities of some $9.0 billion. Hence it was more than just solvent: it was cash-rich. The excess funds were embezzled or diverted by US intelligence. 'He (Colonel Al Carone) was authorized to withdraw funds from First American Bancshares (a.k.a. BCCI) account #2843900, which he stated was a 'Black Operations' fund unknown to the US Congress at the time' - cons istently with Casey's Affidavit statement Carone elaborated that he was the middleman between certain CIA factions and certain Mafia families that operated illegal enterprises in New York City. Carone told the Plaintiff [Tyree] that the CIA used BCCI, BNL (Banca Nazionale del Lavoro), BCP and Intermaritime Bank to launder money for Black Operations worldwide and for the Mafia in New York City'. Note the interesting reference to 'certain CIA factions', which reconfirms that the CIA is riven by internal frictions, rivalries, tensions and perverse loyalties to certain 'competing' 'barons' such as George Bush Sr., Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, who, in turn, may be beholden to foreign powers and elements of their intelligence services. William Tyree's lawsuit then filled in these further dots: 'Colonel Carone said [that] the military drug trafficking Operation WATCHTOW-ER fit[ted] in the picture in the following fa shion. Between 1971 an d 1972 [sic], BCCI was conceived and born primarily as a bank for the US Intelligence Community to go around Congress in funding so-called 'Black Operations'. In December 1975, February-March 1976, Operation WATCHTOWER took place [sic] that brought over 100 military-style plane loads of cocaine out of Colombia into Albrook Air Station in Panama.

'In 1977, Jackson Stephens invited BCCI into America and helped BCCI bring about the purchase of First American Bancshares, operated by Clark Clifford and Robert Airman.... Jackson Stephens and Mochtar Riady were in business together and paid off politicians from Arkansas to look the other way and ignore the CIA cocaine operation at Mena, Arkansas. The Lippo Group, i.e. Mochtar Riady, had been involved with Bill Clinton since Clinton was Governor in Arkansas. Stephens, Riady and the CIA are in bed together. They own a lot of people. They have a lot of money. They get things done. I answer to Stephens indirectly. I answer to his money is who I answer to [sic], and so does everyone else at the CIA that wants to get things done where Stephens has influence'. William Tyree's lawsuit, which was alread y 11 years old when this book was being finalised, further alleged that the criminalised intelligence thugocracy, or Illuminati mob, that have hijacked the US Government, has established its own parallel structures for overthrowing the US Constitution and imposing a coercive state. With the assistance of the 9/11 'Reichstag Fire' provocation, the later establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, or Ministry of State Security, together with the passage of the original post-9/11 Patriot Act USA and subsequent legislation - including the National Intelligence Reform Act signed into law by President Bush Jr. on 17th December 2004 - a much denser superstructure of oppressive mechanisms and legislation has been grafted onto the original framework installed by elements of the US intelligence community to enable the Constitution to be scrapped, and the intelligence cadres that control the Government to seize absolute power, dispensing with the aggravation of constantly having to report to Congress. The obscenely delayed response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast, and the subsequent spin to the effect that local authorities are unable to handle disasters so that national 'solutions' are needed, was intended to provide the basis for a further 'giant leap forward' - as the 'coup d'etat by instalments', modelled on the Hitlerian precedent, forged ahead with apparent im punity. The breaches in the levees occurred several hours after the hurricane had vanished, suggesting prepositioned explosives; Amtrak an d Greyhound Buses refused to assist in evacuations, suggesting that they were ordered not to participate; the so-called Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now absorbed within the Department of Homeland Security, did nothing significant to assist the endangered population, un til they graciously despatched a consignment of 25,000 body bags to the stricken area on 8th September; and the President at first praised the 'incompetent' Michael Brown, head of FEMA, before he was ordered a week later to return to Washington in disgrace. Rations diverted from the stocks of the British military, on being received in the United States, were commandeered by arrogant officials on the grou nd that they contained beef which had to be tested for contamination. Whereas the whole world was waiting to see pictures of relief being distributed to the traumatised residual population, all we saw was Nazi-style swat teams descending the escalator in the New Orleans Convention Center, and military convoys, ships (jamming electronic communications) and armed men descending on the place as though on some kind of macho 'high'. Immediately following the commencement of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003, President George W Bush was seen on the White House video punching his hands into the air and exclaiming 'feels good, feels good' [see Addendum 4, page 681]. None of this 'feels' at all good to outside observers, let alone to unbrainwashed Americans."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"138 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs As indicated, the Tyree Complaint referre d specifically to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The lawsuit a lleged that FEMA, created by Executive Order, is illegitimate not simply because all Executive Orders may be illegal, but also 'since Congress had to approve FEMA for two specific reasons: (1) FEMA is a vaguely written Executive Branch -created agency that has the power to suspend the US Constitution and put the Legislative and Judicial Branches of Government out of work [evidently Michael Brown was bewildered by the powers he could wield, or else a blazing row took place behind the scenes during the New Orleans fi asco, as a consequence of which he was made to look helpless - Ed.] (2) FEMA is an Executive Branch creation that clearly affects all three branches of Government capable of silencing the voice of the people (i.e., Legislative) and the legal redress of the people (i.e., Judiciary)'. FEMA: A COVERT MILITARY EN TITY FUNDED BY DRUG MONEY According to the lawsuit, FEMA was initially funded by laundered drug money. The Plaintiff alleges that the defendants CIA and George Bush did intentionally engage in the complained-of conduct herein to conceal... the origins of FEMA, and that profits from drug trafficking by the CIA were used in some part to originally fund FEMA and the drafting of the FEMA infrastructure'. William Ty ree's Complaint further stated that Colonel Carone had told him (the Plaintiff) that 'Colon el Ollie North worked on developing a plan known as FEMA, which would in an ill-defined national emergency, allow the US Military to take control of the United States to ensure national security ' and that Colonel Carone had said that 'FEMA originally stood for \"Federal Emergency Military Action\" (i.e. Martial Law) but was retitled \"Federal Emergency Management Agency\" because it would be better received by the people of the United States ' (a presentational and purely cosmetic adjustment). This would explain why little aid arrived in New Orleans (2005) for a week and why all we saw on TV were the images of military vehicles and personnel, and swat teams. Tyree's Affidavit elaborated separatel y that the late Colonel Carone had also claimed that 'he took drug profits that were clean and laundered in 1982-1984 to the following: NSC (National Security Council)' -Colonel Oliver North, who used the f unds to create and develop FEMA' [sic]. So FEMA, at the epicentre of the post-Katrina storm in the United States, was established by CIA drug money. That figures. There are now 600-800 prison camps in the United States, with a particularly large such establishment in Alaska (see the partial list in Appendix 2 to Chapter 8, page 612). Until th e third quarter of 2005, these camps, which were operated or to be operated by FEMA, were all staffe d and even surrounded by full-time guards, but held few inmates, although some of them contained large numbers of prisoners. Under arrangements prevailing right through the New Orleans disaster phase (which Vice- President Richard Cheney called 'an exercise', when he said on 10th September 2005 that 'we are on top of this exercise' - meaning, that from the perspective of the coup d'etat by instalments, all was going according to plan), the camps were to be activated under Martial Law conditions. Since Martial Law was indeed declared, applicable to certain areas, following Hurricane Katrina 'exercise', some FEMA camps were activated accordingly. The significance of Mr Cheney's observation becomes evident in this context. So far as he and the hidden Illuminati controllers who have hijacked the US Government are concerned, the New Orleans catastrophe had tested the readiness of the concentration camp apparat which FEMA exists to operate. The"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 139 name of this extremely sinister organisation, now incorporated under the control of the Department of Homeland Security (US Ministry of State Security), is deliberately mis- leading, as has been explained. A large number of Presidential Executive Orders, now associated with FEMA, have been accumulated over three decades, which would enable the President of the United States to suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights at will. The main Executive Orders concerned are listed on page 605. One question, hard to answer at the time this book was being finalised, has been: what has interfered with the timetable of the coup d'etat by instalments? Why have there been so many in stalments to date? What has been preventing the Illuminati from consolidating their gains and 'going all the way'? It is not as though the Executive Branch lacks the necessary powers to finalise the transformation of the United States into the Fourth Reich, as is intended, overnight. For instance, the Federal Government can take over all modes of transport and the control of highways, seaports and airports, can seize full control of the communications media, and can seize all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals. The authorities can grab all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles, and may, by Executive Order, impose total control over all highways, seaports and waterways. They can take over all food resources and farms and can mobilise civilians into work brigades under official supervision (Communist direction of labour). The Government can also immediately assume control over all health, welfare and education functions, while the Postmaster General is designated to operate a national registration system for all persons in the United States. Another Executive Order allows the Government to take over all US airports and aircraft, including commercial planes. The Housing and Finance Authority can, under Executive Order powers, relocate communities, build ne w housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations. The Government can take over all railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities, while a separate Order specifies the responsibilities of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorisation for all Executive Orders to be put into effect simultaneously at times of increased international tension and economic or financial crisis. There is a special Order which allocates authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institu te industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions (the US GULAG), and to advise and assist the President in respect of these powers; and critical emergency preparedness functions are assigned to Federal Departments and agencies, with one Order consolidating 21 operative Executive Or ders issued over a 15-year period. And in a little-reported development, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which enables the US President to seize the property of a foreign country or national, and has been implemented in respect of Iranian, Cuban, Libyan, North Korean and Iraqi assets, has since 1979 been partly the responsibility of FEMA: in that year, these foreign asset seizure powers were transferred to FEMA in the course of a sweeping consolidation, although they have in practice been exercised by the Treasury. So, the CIA-controlled pipeline of drug money is disgorging its contents, in part, into the bank accounts of the corporations that are enga ged in the construction or upgrading of the US concentration camps, or have been so engaged in the recent past. And what physical assets are historica lly associated with concentration camps? Obviously, death trains. An updated catalogue of the concentration camps - which are"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"140 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs replicated in Canada, where virtually all milit ary bases, especially those located north of the 50th parallel, are set up with concentration camps - is provided, as noted, on page 612. Details of what is known (in the public domain) of the US death and population transportation trains, all modelled on the Nazi precedent, are provided on page 602 et seq.. An Amtrak railcar repair facility in Marion Co unty, Indianapolis, is reliably reported to have 3-4-inch gas mains leading to large furnaces (crematoria), helicopter landing pads, railheads for prisoners, Red/Blue/Green zones for the classification and processing of the incoming human beings, one-way turnstiles, barracks, towers, high fences topped with razor (barbed) wire, and an adjacent refrigeration plant facility for the bodies pending cremation. Separately, the Author was informed in September 2005 that a television film had been shown in Indiana, in which 21 local concentration camp facilities were identified, and in which scenes of people being forced into delousing and disinfecting areas were shown. Thereafter, the video stopped, with no explanation. The Author's source indicated that the reason the film stopped with the disinfecting operation was that, thereafter, the lives of the people in the film came to an abrupt end. It was not clear whether this represented an enactment, or was 'for real'. The 'mys tery of iniquity' again. The Author suspects, as do several of his advise rs, that the US coup d'etat by instalments is far further advanced than is generally realis ed, and that it was, in the second half of 2006, by no means out of the question that 'Final Solution' operations were being reconsidered. A similar conclusion could be drawn from the unknow n fate of large numbers of the poor Blacks who were were forcibly removed from New Orleans, in what appeared to be an outbreak of ethnic cleansing (sorry, Mr Cheney, it was an 'exercise'). Ghastly and shocking though these revelations ar e bound to be to any sane person, there is a great deal more evidence that the crim inalisation of the US Government structures, consequent upon the Government having been hijacked by the Illuminati, may be almost beyond recall. As one US intelligence operativ e put it to one of the Author's US friends, 'they are out of the gate and can't go back'. But they can be fatally tripped up. TELL-TALE CLUE OF ILLUMINATI PROVENANCE OF THE U.S. 'GULAG' We are now able to link the Illuminati directly with FEMA and the concentration camps and death trains infrastructure. The highest 'Degree' of the sect of the Illuminati is entitled 'Rex'. This level of 'Illumination' represents the apex of the 'Greater Mysteries', and is superior to the rank or 'Degree' of 'Magus' [see Chapter 7 on the Illuminati: e.g., Figure 78, page 497]. Within the complex FEMA nexus of regulations and schemes is the 'Rex-84' Program, ostensibly established in part to exert control over any 'mass influx' of illegal aliens across the Mexican/US border. Under this plan, such hoardes would be rounded up and held in detention (= concentra tion) camps. It was under 'Rex-84' that the policy of closing down US military bases and converting many of them into concentration camps was initiated. Two sub-operations that are associat ed with 'Rex-84'are Operation Cable Splicer and Operation Garden Plot, which were to be implemented once the 'Rex-84' Program had been initiated for its original purpose (as probably occurred in the context of the New Orleans atrocity, but may have been happening earlier, as suggested above). Cable Splicer is a plan to procure the 'orderly takeover' of State and local governments by the Federal Government. FEMA was intended to be the executive arm of the planned US Nazi-style Police State, with a brief to head up all operations; but, as indicated, FEMA itself was subsumed within the Department of Homeland Security under George Bush II: so that, as the New Orleans event may have revealed,"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 141 lines of communication may have become atr ophied or severely compromised. At all events, the concentration (sorry, 'detentio n') camps have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention infrastr uctures, while many also have an airport close at hand. Most of the concentration camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners, with the largest concentration cam p being based outside Fairbanks, Alaska. This is a massive 'mental health' facility, modell ed along Himmlerian lines (but on a far larger scale), which is equipped to hold approximat ely 2 million people. Many of the camps are even referred to locally as 'Rex-84' camps - an example being a camp at Oakdale, 90 miles east of San Francisco, CA, which is capable of holding 20,000 people. While the majority of the US concentration camps were devoid of inmates as late as the first quarter of 2006, a number of camps were known to be heavily populated - an example being a renovated internment camp at El Reno, on Route 66, Colorado, which holds 12,000 inmates 'as we speak'. Camps holding ex-New Orleans residents were also said to be extensively in use. Before continuing, it is appropriate to review the dynamic of the intended Fourth Reich, currently being haltingly constructed on the planned ruins of the United States, which appears to be well on track towards becoming the worst abomination in world history. A Government which, like that of the United States, has been so comprehensively compromised that its intellige nce community is up to its n eck in criminal operations, cooperative operations with the Mafia, and above all, drug-trafficking and distribution activities - and associated with which powerf ul individuals have enriched themselves, accumulating vast hidden financial power, including licence to order the liquidation, framing, incarceration, discrediting, or beating up of 'enemies', recalcitrant journalists, whistleblowers and others who stand up to their serial thuggery - will inevitably reach a 'tipping point' beyond which recovery from such institutionalised corruption becomes impossible. This is happening in the United Kingdom, as is evident from the Author's detailed observations, published in Internationa l Currency Review, of the institutionalised looting that is characteristic of the Europe an Commission and its related structures, which has spread its corrupt way of life to all the EU 'Member States'. HOW CRIMINALISM LEADS INEVITABLY TO AUTHORITARIANISM The point is that it is though criminalisati on - especially the universalisation of drug- trafficking and distribution, with its accompanying scourge of comprehensive financial corruption, and the accompanying d ecadence with which these evils are associated - that the safeguards against what is happening before our eyes in the United States are challenged, eroded, and finally openly dismantled, to the bored indifference of the majority of the (disenfranchised) electorate, with its one- track 'baseball game' mentality. It was disconcerting for the Author to be informed by a Belgian, long resident in the United States and married to an American, that 'the American people will just love the coming dictatorship. They are ideal fodder for this. In the United States, if you cross someone, you are quite likely to have your tires slashed, or to be subjected to other forms of wanton harassment, since these people cannot bear to be c ontradicted or told what they don't want to hear'. Of course, this is far from the menta lity of the millions of Americans who understand, to a greater or a lesser extent, what lies in store, and who, in many cases, devote a considerable part of their waking hours to trying to alert their fellow citizens to what awaits them. But the assessment does not, unfortunately, diverge from the Author's own somewhat bitter experience."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"142 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Which takes us straight back to the Special Group, mentioned earlier, that functions 'below' the National Security Council but is actually (in a rather Leninist twist) superior to the NSC - the secret operations of which are not necessarily known even to the President of the United States, let alone to the US Congress. These glimpses of serial Hluminati criminalist abominations -just a selection from a colossal menu which would require several large volumes to describe - were originally justified, as we have seen, on the spurious, false and nonsensically cynical basis that it made perfect sense to sell drugs to Americans, in order to fight Communism. What this knowledge reveals to us is with what diabolical subtlety the Illuminati leveraged and exploited the dialectic of the Communist 'threat'. The late DCI, William Casey, motivated by the precedent established by William Colby, and by his intelligence associates of German background, was possibly naive enough to fall for the bait. Had he been in a position to apply appropriate standards, and had he seen through the deception, Casey would have ordered the clandestine drug operations in Latin America to be closed down. As we shall see, the chief organiser of the cartels was actually a German agent working deep within the corrupted American intelligence structures, named Carlos Lehder. While, therefore, on the surface, with the benefit of intelligence divulged in the following pages, it would appear that the cartels were established by elements of the deeply corrupted US intelligence structures, th e actualite was that a covert Nazi - working, the Author suspects, for the DVD, based at Dachau - was primarily instrumental, under higher alleged German assets (suc h as, allegedly George H. W. Bush Sr. and his henchman, Jim Baker), in setting up the Latin American cartel s. Assuming this to be broadly correct, the DVD was engaged, together with its co-consp irators in Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) which works through the Americas Department of the Cuban Communist Party, in ensuring the long-term subversion of the United States and the terminal corruption of US intelligence and of the banking system. German and Sovi et covert intelligence work together, representing the two blades of one operational pair of scissors [see page 629]. This leaves currently unreso lved the allegiance of William Colby, who was responsible for facilitating the discrediting (unsuccessfully) of the genuine Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, who revealed, in detail, the Soviet long-range revolutionary subversion strategy in his books 'New Lies for Old' and \"The Perest roika Deception'. Was he, like Edward Heath, Geoffrey Rippon, Roy Jenkins and the Dulles Brothers, a long-term German Abwehr/DVD agent? When Carlos Lehder was suddenly released and relocated not to Colombia, but to Germany, in 2000 [see page 156], his release from jail and relocation were arranged by former President Bush Sr.'s factotum, Jim Baker. As has been seen, William Casey's rationa le (Jesuit casuistry) was based upon the egregious lie that drug users consume toxic substances out of choice - whereas, after having succumbed to the initial temptation, their addiction drives their demand, which is met by supply: so that if the supply is absent in the first place, the initial temptation is not present, and the subsequent artificial demand cannot arise. Ignoring the reality that drugs differ from all other commodities in that their consumption is driven by supply, not demand (a typically Sa tanic inversion), has led the United States, and much of the rest of the world, to the verge of a millennial crisis not only of governance, but also of modern society. The outcome is spreading lawlessness and the wholesale corruption of the collaborating international banking system. The end -result, that we are witnessing today, is the collapse of the Rule of Law."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 143 HOW THE DIALECTIC MISLED EVEN THE UNITED STATES' TOP SPIES The disturbing revelation so far is that the United States' top intelligence officers were so preoccupied with their oppos ition to Soviet Communism, that they lacked any under- standing of the dialectical reality that the Cold War masked the lack of any discontinuity of long-range pan-German strategy. The Nazi Fifth Column inside the CIA specialised in exploiting the menace of Communism to disgui se DVD strategy, predicting, for instance, a large Communist buildup in Latin America in the early 1970s. Operation WATCHTOWER was initiated to preposition drugs in Panama/Central America from South America, ostensibly to fund covert actions against th e predicted Communist threat. The prediction became reality, and the flow of cocaine into the United States increased as a result of the prediction. Since the Vietnam e xperience, policymakers knew that it would be useless asking Congress to finance covert action in Latin Ameri ca. An avenue needed to be established that took the CIA out of the pictur e, because the CIA was already busy fending off allegations of trafficking drugs out of Southeast Asia and Europe; and the CIA needed to avoid being seen to be tied into the Latin American cocaine trade. Operation WATCHTOWER generated vast quantities of cocaine which was meant to be sold to finance anti-Communist operations in Latin America because Congress had shut down general funding of anti-Communist activities in that region. Likewise, heroin trafficking had been un dertaken by the CIA in Southeast Asia on the pretext of 'fighting Communism'. Nor did US intelligence, both military and 'civilian', develop and apply this diabo lical strategy in any way half-heartedly - treating, and continuing to deal with, the American people with ruthless contempt. On the contrary, it is American intelligence - influenced and, as will be show n, led by German penetration agents - which, acting on the basis of the same instructions that were adopted by William Casey, was responsible for estab lishing the Colombian drug cartels, which the international general public has all along as sumed to have been home-grown, self- standing organised criminal networks. Exposure of this abomination has, thanks to the CIA's control of the American media, and the fecklessness of elements of its British counterpart, been suppressed. Perhaps it was this particular abomination to which President George H. W Bush Sr. is reported to have referred when he made the apocryphal comment that 'if the American people knew what we have done, they would string us all up on lamp posts'. As the Author has observed elsewhere, stock market punters might be well advised to buy shares in th eir local street furniture manufacturer, as an unprecedented number of lamp posts will be needed in an y overdue settling of scores with the mobsters who, under cover of their intelligence community and Illuminati backgrounds, have long since effectively torn up the American Constitution, destroyed the Rule of Law, and nullified the Bill of Rights. On 17th April 2004, the Author, who was speaking by telephone from England to a contact in the United States, observed in a decisive manner that the staffs of US official structures that were engage d in drug-trafficking needed to be 'string up from lamp posts' - a remark intended to evoke the admission attributed to George Bush Sr..

A few days earlier, the Author had been speaking transatlant- ically with another American friend on the same subject, commenting forcefully that one thing was certain: all who push drugs are engaged in creating hell on ear th not least for their addict victims, and they themsel ves will all go to hell itself. You guessed correctly. The transatlantic telephone connection went dead again. Obviously, the Dark Forces listening to the Au thor's telephone conversations don't like being reminded that they themselves are lo cked inside the fast train to hell. THE C.I.A. HAS HISTORICALLY ALW AYS 'JUSTIFIED' ITS DRUG OPERATIONS But of course, there has always been a 'rationa l' alibi to cover US intelligence drug-running operations. CIA criminalist operations proliferat ed up to 50 years ago in the shadow of the overt Cold War. By the 1980s, the CIA and its controlled cadres were engaged in a convoluted hidden drug-traffick ing programme involving high-ranking La Cosa Nostra figures, the Gambino crime family, the Japan ese Yakuza - with various associated cabals engaged in political intrigue at both the State and national levels - espionage, weapons technologies including traffick ing in biotoxins such as the pathogen which produces mad cow disease (illuminating why the British author ities 'needed' to 'sacrifice' cattle some years ago on such a colossal scale, as they may have been combating 'blowback' against British intelligence), drug trafficking, money laundering and of course murder-for-hire. The CIA is the covert operations division of the US Executive Branch's foreign policy strategists, and has been engaged in multiple terrorist activities over the years: in fact, like the KGB, it has been described as a terrorist organisation. Such abominable abuses of secret power were and remain possible not least thanks to the National Security Act of 1947 et seq., which can very accurately be described in combination as providing US intelligence, like its covert Soviet and Chinese counterparts, with carte blanche to perpetrate criminal operations and to rampage around the world implementing scams against foreign governments and selected individual targets, with impunity. In other words, US in telligence is covered by a 'crooks' charter' -supplemented by the geomasonic culture of omerta rooted in oaths taken by Masons at several stages of their progressive initiations - which end by no t even excluding treason and murder from the obligation upon members of 'The Brotherhood' to protect each other against exposure of their crimes, including High Crimes and Misdemeanours i nvolving the highest office-holders. So incestuously intertwined have these geop olitical underworld covert criminalist intelligence operations become that it has ev en been known for 'rival' intelligence agencies to run drug rings within their competitors' intelligence communities. The deep penetration operations masterminded by Carlos Lehder ap pear to have been a case in point. Another such example of this concerns an Israeli intelligence office r known as Al Holbert, who in due course rang alarm bells by investigator s who had not been aware of this evil man's background. Al Holbert was allegedly the king-pin behind a huge drug-running organisation functioning within the CIA called 'The Company' (not to be confused with the identical familiar term for the CIA). Since interpenetration of 'rival' national (and domestic) intelligence agencies is the 'name of the game', it is hardly surprising that a corollary must be interpenetration of drug operations within the targeted intelligenc e communities. Since, by descending into the drug-trafficking gutter, intelligence commu nities compromise themselves irreparably, penetration is soon transformed, via 'rivalry', into (Satanic) cooperation."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 145 ANOTHER 'SMOKING GUN' AFFIDAVIT IN WHICH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S CRIMINALITY IS EXPOSED In the United States, insights into the cess pit of corruption that has engulfed the US structures as a consequence of t he failure of the CIA to use a long spoon prior to supping with the Devil in its llluminati incarnation, are frequently obtainable from open court records.

I was assigned to both the Foreign Counter-inte lligence Division and the Criminal Division. During this period, my investigations into t hese matters revealed criminal activities and operations which I reported and documented to my superiors in the FBI, as follows: • The involvement of officials, agents and oper atives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with organized crime members and drug-trafficking activities. And the participation of members of the CIA who engaged in the looting of the Savings and Loan (Thrift) Industries, financial scams and fraudulent securities transactions. • The involvement of people from the Nati onal Security Agency Staff and Council and the White House in criminal activities associated with funding the acquisition of military supplies and equipment, arms and ammunition, which were referred to as the Iran-Contra Arms Initiative, known as Irangate, and the Iraqi scandal (Iraqgate). • Associations between known and suspecte d members of the Mafia, and CIA agents in conducting drug-trafficking activities and financial frauds. I was ordered by my supervisors in the FBI to halt these investigations, destroy my written reports, terminate my informants and make no reference to these criminal and subversive activities implicating high-ranking Government officials, politicians, Mafia and business leaders who controlled and manipulated Government agencies and operations. Without any support from my superiors at the FBI New York Field Office, I then sent a letter describing what I had discovered in my official status as an FBI Special Agent, to the FBI Director, William Sessions, and this was ignored. I proceeded to write [to] Congressional officials, among them Senators Arlan Sp ector, Alfonse D'Amato, John Kerry and Congressman Norman Lent, Charles Schumer, and many others who were on both the Senate and House Intelligence Oversight Co mmittees.

It consisted of 'about 300 members, many of them former military men or ex-police officers with nearly $30 million worth of assets, including planes, ships and real estate'. The article elaborated that 'Federal drug agents said that the organization had imported billions of doll ars' worth of drugs from Latin America, and was also involved in gun-running and mercenary operations'. Its specialised military equipment consisting inter alia of a TV camera for taking pictures during the hours of darkness, 1,500 rounds of small arms tracer ammunition for use in night combat, nine infrared sniperscopes, a remote-controlled helicopter, and secret components from the radar unit of a Sidewinder guided missile, which were stolen from a US Naval Weapons station in the Mojave Desert. The San Francisco Chronicle obtained this and other related information after Mr Brian Leighton, a former Assistant US Attorn ey in Fresno, California, had been instru- mental in facilitating the in dictment of 29 members of 'The Company' in 1981. US Federal agents had reported to the Grand Jury examining the matter that the stolen equipment was going to be used to provide dr ug operatives with elect ronic equipment, with some of it being intended for trading to dr ug suppliers in Colombia. Among the 29 drugs and arms operatives indicted was a former US narcotics officer called Andrew 'Drew' Thornton, who was aged 40 at the time. Once again, the judicial system was having to examine a criminalist operation with nefarious intellig ence connections. On 13th September 1985, The L OS Angeles Times published a report on Thornton's death, entitled: 'F ORMER N ARCOTICS O FFICER P ARACHUTES O UT OF P LANE , D IES WITH 77 P OUNDS OF C OCAINE '. The article said that Thornton had b een indicted in 1981 (see above) for 'flying a plane to South America for a re puted drug ring known as The Company\". Interviewed by The Los Angeles Times, Mr Leighton made the following under- standably cynical comment : 'I'm glad his parac hute didn't open. I hope he got a hell of a high out of that...'. Leighton subsequently went into private law practice. Further public domain information concerning The Company' appeared in a now obscure book by Sally Denton called 'T HE Blue Grass Conspiracy'. This book revealed that The Company's' base was located at Lexington, Ke ntucky, and that US pr osecutors in Lexington, Fresno (Brian Leighton) and Miami had been cooperating in an op eration to 'bring The Company down'. The San Francisco Chronicle noted that in January 1982, Gene Berry, a State prosecutor located in Charlotte Harbour, Flor ida, was shot in the face as he answered his door. Police subsequently arrested a certain Bonnie Kelly for Berry's murder. Bonnie's husband, Mike McLure Kelly (codenamed 'Gopher'), was a suspected member of 'the Company', who later pleaded guilty in the Fresno, California, case. Significantly, the 'former' Israeli intellig ence operative, more recently operating from Montreal, Ari ben-Menashe, lived for a time in Lexington. Sources have advised this Author of the existence of a declaration by Mr William Hamilton, the inventor of the original PROMIS software (which reconciles conflicting software programs and can be used inter alia to hack into bank accounts) which contained inter alia the following statements:'... On or about April 3, 1991, I spoke by telephone with Mr Brian Leighton, an attorney in private pr actice in Fresno, California. He stated that during the 1980s, while serving as an assistant United States Attorney in Fresno, California, he had investigated a nationwide criminal enterprise known as 'The Company', which was engaged in illegal drug trafficking on a massive scale'."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 147 AL HOLBERT, DOUBLE OR TRIPLE AGENT In 1991 and 1992, coinciding with 'the changes' in the 'former' Soviet Union ('collapsible Communism'), a series of sudden violent deaths of US intelligence operatives, all connected with the 'Iran-Contra' affair (shorthand for a much broader secret nexus of off-balance- sheet intelligence operations) began. One of the very earliest victims was Alan Michael May, aged 50 - a former Northern California Field Director in Richard Nixon's Presidential campaign and the lawyer for Mr Nixon's brothers Donald and Edward (who was found dead in his San Francisco home on 19th June 1991). This was some four days after the 'Napa Sentinel' newspaper described Ma y's role in the alleged plot by officials of the Republican Party to bribe Iranian officials to delay the release of US hostages until after President Reagan's inauguration in January 1981 (the operation known as 'The October Surprise'). Alan May was allegedly involved with a certain Al Holbert in 'the Company', described separately at the time by a concerned US intelligence source, as 'a current national security nightmare to this country'. From such sources it has been possible to assemble certain intelligence about this Al Holbert. First, he was exceptionally interested in technology (i.e., accessing advanced US technology with a view to stealing such secrets for intelligence purposes). He had a firm grasp of physics, mathematics, chemistry and military hardware: in other words, from these multiple interests alone one could deduce th at he was a military intelligence operative. Secondly, according to the US operative Mchael Riconosciuto, who knew and dealt with Holbert from 1961 to 1981, Holbert passed on secrets he obtained through his myriad contacts in the United States, to the Israelis. Thirdly, on arrival in the United States (year unspecified by the Author's source), Holbert went to work for the US Treasury in Philadelphia. A spokesperson for the Treasury confirmed that Holbert was 'involved at very high levels, giving special training'. So, is the US Treasury that criminalised? Roconosciuto further elaborated: 'Al Holbert taught courses in interrogation tech- niques. He also taught touchkill techniques, you know, with the thumbs on the temples and various scary areas like that. He moved around to a lot of different (US) agencies. He got involved with the FBI and he was involved with the Drug Enforcement people'. Notwithstanding these myriad penetrations, he told Riconosciuto throughout his 15-year acquaintance that he worked for the Israelis. However other US intelligence officers had been curious, not to say suspicious, of Holbert for a long time. When pressed about the possibility of Holbert having been a double agent, Riconosciuto replied, in the course of a debriefing: 'Well, he was with the Soviets, but he was also with the Israelis. Holbert definitely is connected with Israeli intelligence. I mean, there's no ifs and buts, or maybes... He was decorated in combat for them'. Michael Riconosciuto travelled to Israel, where he met an official who was the Deputy Israeli Defence Minister for a number of years, in charge of defence production, a friend of Ariel Sharon. It was through this offi cial, and a General Peratt, that Riconosciuto reconfirmed Al Holbert's position with the Israelis. Riconosciuto is on record as having told US intelligence (which he also served) that 'Holbert is definitely one of their boys. I got an admission out of General Peratt that Al Holber t was... a Trotskyite, and they knew about it; and I couldn't understand why they kept a guy like that around. I was told that I just didn't understand the ways of the world'. This is a familiar intelligence operative put-down. In this context, what was intended to be meant here was that Riconoscuito didn't understand the dialectical"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"148 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs method, whereby both dimensions of conflict are managed and macro-controlled by a common manipulative source, from above (cf. the 'scissors strategy': pages XXXIII and 629). However Riconosciuto knew much that was of interest to his interlocutors, including the fact that Holbert reported to one Jean-Pierre Boegner, a French operative, whose address was the extremely expensive one of 114 Champs Elysees, Paris 8ieme, France. According to another key source, Jean Pier re Boegner reported directly to Colonel Stefan Uznanski of Ukraine, a very senior KGB (not GRU) officer. This would make sense, because although the GRU (Soviet Mili tary Intelligence) plans and directs the Soviet dimension of the drug offensive agai nst America and the West, the KGB handles all the financial arrangements. Uznanski was based in Vienna and Salzbu rg. Boegner served time in a French jail following one of the assassination attempts on Ge neral de Gaulle. Riconosciuto eventually discovered from Holbert that he was also a Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) officer, and that he had bragged that there were (in the mi d-1990s) over 35,000 GRU agents active on the North American continent. According to US operatives working with the CIA-linked Wackenhut Corporation, the actual number at that time was about 50% lower - still a colossally high and disturbing number, implying that there was no barrier to these Soviet operatives entering the United States. That is consistent with what is known about the Soviets' 'criminalism offensive' against th e United States and the West, based on boasts by senior 'post'-Soviet officials that the West was being flooded with criminalists from the Soviet Union and from all over Eastern Europe. Riconosciuto added: 'You know, he's touched the Central Intelligence Agency, the Treasury Department, the US Secret Service and various local law enforcement ag encies all over the country'. SOVIET DRUG OPERATIONS COND UCTED FROM WITHIN THE CIA Does this outline information represent just evidence of Soviet penetration of US intelligence, or was Al Holbert at one stage essentially running 'The Company' or certain of its key operations, from within US intelligence , while at the same time serving the Israelis and the GRU? Sophisticates imply that drug and related criminalist operations are now, and have been for perhaps two or th ree decades, a 'free-for-all' sphere of activity in which the criminal intelligence classes of key drug-pedd ling countries and regions like the 'former' Soviet Union, Bulgaria, China, Germany, France, Spain, Israel and the United States collaborate, compete and are integrated with, either their own domestic or else foreign intelligence cadres - so that it has ceased to make sense to interpret these appalling developments as indicative of power struggles between nation states, since the drug and related criminal busine sses have all been comprehensively internationalised. They ignore all national borders. For instance, cooperatio n between criminalism operatives of US and Israeli intelligence can be traced back to th e assistance provided to the CIA by the (Jewish) Meyer Lansky crime syndicate from Chicago, with which the CIA was cooperating from an early stage of its existence. The Lansky Syndicate reportedly set up international drug- running operations from Southeast Asia thr ough the CIA-linked Corsican Mafia in the Mediterranean. The re sulting lucrative joint Lansky-CIA international drug racketeering operations thrived against the background of deep US involvement in Southeast Asia, which was itself a perverse cover for US inte lligence drug-smuggling activities: and since the Vietnam War years, the CIA has been at th e forefront of heroin and cocaine trafficking globally. Concerned observers will doubtless ask: what is the extent to which these activities"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 149 represent official policy? We know that the ongoing covert Soviet drug offensive against the West is official policy (sabotage). So, doe s the United States pur sue a countervailing or similar strategy? The answer is that US in telligence has been cr iminalised since the Second World War, and that one of the 'justifica tions' it uses to 'rationalise' this behaviour is precisely that the United States has no c hoice, because 'everyone else is doing it'. As has already been discussed, this 'line' is im moral and intolerable. A so-called Great Nation like the United States should have the guts to suppress its own drug-running operations, to announce this to the whole world, and then to warn other countries' intelligence services that the writing is on the wall for them, as well. To continue in thrall to the blanket corruption and associated blackmail arising from its intelligence community's descent into the gutter will result in the destruction of the Republic. Unfortunately, the grip of the German Fifth Column/Illuminati on the US intelligence and offi cial structures is so comprehensive that this outcome seems almost inevitable. As an example of the use of drugs for political purposes by the United States, it is thought in this context that Turkey has long been a key route through which US intelligence-linked operatives have been filtering drugs into the 'former' Soviet space. Public domain information exists to the effect that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 'inadvertently' uncovered the colossal CIA drug trafficking scandals. However the FBI is subordinated to the CIA, which is in turn subordinated to the National Security Agency (NSA) and, after Mr Bush Jr . signed the National Intelligence Reform Act on 17th December 2004, to the Director of National Intelligence, the first holder of that new post being John Negroponte. The frustration of honest FBI agents is evident from open intelligence concerning one or more FBI Affidavits in support of applications to intercept wire communications, in order, according to one of these FBI Affidavits, to determine 'source, type and quantity of narcotics/c ontrolled substances, methods and means of delivery, and the source of funding for purchasing narcotics/controlled substances'. The relevant intercepts were to be implemented in respect of a number of very well-known CIA operatives and their superiors. The resulting intercepted communications read li ke a 'Who's Who' of US organised criminal intelligence. OPEN DATA ON U.S. OFFICIAL DRUG-RUNNING Mr Ron Rosenbaum, the investigative reporter who has written for Vanity Fair, reported some years ago in one of his articles, on Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, head of the Cali drug cartel, who was 'deeply involved with Michael Abell, formerly of the US Department of Defense'. Copious notes for a proposed book by Danny Casarolo, the journalist murdered by the familiar Illuminati means of poison and whose death William Hamilton has said was related to his investigation into the linked PROMIS software scandal, were deposited by his brother, Dr Tony Casarolo, with the Western Historical Manuscript Collection at the University of Missouri. According to a graduate student who examined the notes, they focused on a cabal of leading US intelligence operatives, one of whom was identified as Glen Shockley, a CIA contract employee who allegedly ran 'Jose Londono' of the Cali Cartel. This information is derived from a taped interview with Michael Riconosciuto conducted by US Government agents while he was negotiating for inclusion in the Witness Protection Program. If US intelligence operatives were 'running' Cali Drug Cartel operatives, does it not follow that the Cali Cartel, the Medellin Cartel, and other such drug-running organisations in Latin America may actually have been (and their replacements or successors"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"150 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs today actually are) operations of US intelligence? It has been confirmed to us at the highest level that this is indeed the case. The Colombian cartels were established by US intelligence. But behind this operation, at least one notorious German (DVD) operative has been identified. And as will be explained when we examine the Illuminati sect in detail, global drug-trafficking is the Illuminati's main speciality, together with prostitution, human trafficking, and other abominations of this nature. Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela was arrested, along with a certain Jorge Luis Ochoa, the notorious drug runner, in Madrid, a Europ ean centre of Illuminati drug ops., and extradited to Colombia in the mid-1980s. Rodriguez Orejuela was kept in jail in Cali, of all places, for a full year. Other inmates ran errands for him and the prison director referred to him as Don Gilberto. His cell resembled a hotel suite, as he was allowed to equip it with whatever luxuries he chose. On an occasion refe rred to as the Day of the Prisoner, it was Sr. Rodriguez Orejuela himself who hosted a huge party away from the prison - attended, among others, by the State Governor. When his trial eventually took place, it wa s a farce, the main witness against him being a lowly US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent who did not speak fluent Spanish. He was accordingly provided with an official interpre ter who did not speak fluent English. She found it impossible to convey the details of his evidence, and the agent spent much of his time on the witness stand with his face buried in his hands, poor man, attempting to contain his disbelief. The trial was not even held in the courtroom itself, but rather in the Judge's office, which was so overcrowded that it could barely hold the participants, let alone representatives of the press and television who travelled to Cali from Bogota. The local media wholly ignored the trial. During the trial hearing, Rodr iguez Orejuela even directed the television crews as to when they could and could not run their camer as. His first decision each day was to choose the menu for lunch, whereupon, as befits a Mafia boss, he would instruct one of his many attending aides what to buy. At lunchtime, the improvised courtroom was turned into a canteen and Rodriguez Or ejuela would invite the Judge to join him, an invitation that His Honor was careful not to decl ine, for fear of his life. TYPICALLY FARCICAL ACQUITTAL In July 1987, Rodriguez Orejuela was acquitte d of all the charges that had been brought against him. This meant that not only was he a free man in Colombia, but he was further immune from extradition to the United States on the original charges. In any case, by then the reconstituted Colombian Supreme Court had decided, by a single vote, that Colombia's extradition treaty with the United States was unconstitutional. The Colombian Government of the day subse quently attempted to repair the flaws in the legislation underlying the treaty, but in June 1987, the Supreme Court rejected it for a second time. All-night parties were celebrated th at very night in Mede llfn, Cali and Bogota. As one observer in Medellin put it, 'they celebrated the news as they do when they crown (drug world jargon for 's uccessfully comple te') a trip. For them, it was the best crowning they ever had'. In the present c ontext, it appears that Rodriguez Orejuela's trial was a farce because he was a key asset of US intelligence, with which he was cooperating and who were 'running' him, meaning that his operations were actual ly drug operations of US intelligence. In the interests of fairness, though, it is necessary to mention in passing that justice in Colombia in those days (and probably still today) was/is a farce generally. This is odd, because suburbs of Bogota look exactly like, say, Weybridge,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 151 in Surrey, England - with ersa tz Tudor-style houses and English-style gardens that seem to have been lifted straight out of prosperous London suburbs. The reason for this state of affairs is that Bogota's plusher suburbs were built in the 1930s by builders who used UK housing plans, reflecting the extensive Britis h influence in Colombia (something that comes as a surprise to many). Given this influe nce, it is very curious that the British do not appear to have succeeded in implanting in Colombia the standards, or anything at all approaching the standards, applicable to the pre-E.U. British system of justice. Middle class Colombians are sophisticated and highly critical of their own country, although they routinely use th e standard excuse that there's nothing wrong with the drug business because it just meets demand - wherea s of course, as discussed, drugs are the one commodity in the world that depend for their sales figures on supply, not demand. If the supply is cut off, demand falls away (admittedly leaving existing consumers suicidal, but at least more liable to survive). Colombian lawyers, asked for their opinions of the local criminal justice system, are ofte n brutally cand id. For example: THE CORRUPT COLOMBIAN LEGAL NON-SYSTEM In the 1980s, two British reporters were take n on a tour of Bogota's courts. They duly found out that the Colombian court and justic e systems are 'a joke '. 'The prosecutor, sporting an open collar shirt, swivelled in his chair, smoking a cigarette and drinking soda from a bottle. The three-member jury looked aimlessly at the ceiling with no apparent interest in the arguments of one of the defence lawyer s, whose table was partially covered by half- eaten sandwiches. The defendant paid no atte ntion to the proceedings whatsoever, while his relatives chatted loudly among themselves and exchanged luncheon snacks. \"And this is a showpiece\", explained our knowledgeable guide'. 'In cases like these, we were told, juries almost inevitably vote for acquittal - for fear that if they don't, they will be the next victims. The judges share that fear. \"They don't make enough money to live decently, they don't make enough to buy a car, they are not important enough to deserve decent protection\", said our guide. \"If you want to see the bottom line, go along to one of the office bathrooms\" (American eu phemism for toilet); \"there is no toilet paper, no soap, no towe l. Under those circumstances, who isn't going to have a price?\"' The Colombian drug capo, Carlos Lehder, of crucial significance, as already indicated, did not get off so lightly after he was captured, although his capture had momentous consequences very much later. In late Ja nuary 1987, a man walked into the office of a high-ranking local police officer in Medellin and asked how much reward he would receive if he told the authorities where to find 'one of the capos you're looking for'. He was told that although the Colombian Government had approved the payment of rewards for information, there was, as yet, no budget to finance them. So the man walked out of the Police Station, saying: 'I won't tell you, then. Think about it, and I'll call you in a few days'. When he duly returned, he was informed that the Colombian Government had still not been able to provide any money for such rewards, but that the US Embassy in Bogota was willing to pay $50,000 for reliable information. For that amount, the informant disclosed wh ere Carlos Lehder was hiding, but did not name him. At dawn on 4th February 1987, Major William Lemus of the Rionegro Police and 35 police officers raided a residence in the small town of Guarne, located about 20 miles from Medellin. A startled guard opened fire with a machine gun, but"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"152 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs dropped the weapon and ran, as soon as he sa w the uniforms. A dozen young men, all in their underwear, emerged from the residence a nd also tried to escape, but Major Lemus threatened to shoot them. Then Lehder, who now appeared at the doorway, a nnounced: 'Hold your fire please. I'm Carlos Lehder'. Whereupon Lehder and his young men (hireme?) posed for a photograph, as though they were victims of some practical joke, while Lemus called his superiors in Medellin and announced: 'The Virgin has smiled on us. We have captured Carlos Lehder Rivas'. According to the received version of the ev ents which followed, the police called the Mayor of Medellin, who telephoned the Minister of Defence in Bogota. As a result, at 10.45 that morning, the President of Colombia as ked the Minister of Justice whether Carlos Lehder could be extradited immediately to the United States. Before noon, a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) plane was on its way from Florida. In the afternoon, Lehder was taken to Bogota by the Colombian Air Force and at 5.07pm he was placed aboard the DEA's Turbo Commander. Before midn ight, less than 18 hours after his arrest, Lehder was already incarcerated in a US jail in Tampa, Florida. All the usual procedures and international rules had been disregarded. Subsequent reports from Colombia suggest ed that the Medellin Cartel and its extended family were perfectly content that Lehder had been removed from their midst. The other drug king-pins were thereafter allowed to live in comparative peace. Why were the Colombian king-pins so satisfied with this state of affairs? GERMAN-COLOMBIAN PARENTAGE At the time of his deportation, Carlos Lehder Rivas was worth up to $3.0 billion, of which only $2.0 million was subsequently tr aced. Bear in mind th at the CIA 'contract' employee, Glen Shockley, as we have seen, allegedly 'ran Jose Londono' of the Cali Cartel. In 1992, in exchange for his testim ony against Manuel Nori ega, an asset of US intelligence (who had decided that he wanted a larger cut from US drug operations) and originally a subordinate of Sr. Lehder, the Am erican authorities redu ced Lehder's publicly announced sentence from life plus 135 years, to 55 years (for public consumption). The original prosecutor of Lehder, Robert Merk le, later complained that Lehder's special treatment in prison, and the reduced sentence, together with alleged protection for him and his family in the United States, represented a travesty of the so-called Witness Protection Program. 'First of all, Lehder's testimony was entirely gratuitous and unnecessary for a conviction of Noriega. Secondly, they gave a deal to the guy who was directing the bad activities, to convict someone who was followi ng directions'. In other words, with respect to drug operations, Carlos Lehder Rivas was the capo and Noriega -who at one stage angered the CIA by advising them not to transfer arms to the Nicaraguan Contras in exchange for drugs - was indeed his subordinate. Which, in translation, meant that Noriega was originally 'run' by Carlos Lehder. According to his legend (which means that the information may be inaccurate), Lehder was born in the United States of a German father (Wilhelm) and a Colombian mother. Given the very extensive penetration of the Central Intelligence Agency, over several generations, by Germans, Sr. Lehder was clear ly 'suitable material' for CIA recruitment - especially as he started his criminal life as a low-level drug dealer in Mchigan, home of many notorious drug Mafia Illuminati families, and whence the similar low-life perpetrator, 'Mike' Delmart Vreeland, also emerged from the underground into the intel-"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 153 ligence community [see details of his findings implicating Uday Hussein in 9/11, Figure 24, pages 96-97]. Another prominent, and ruthless, operative of German extraction was the CIA Director of Operations - the previously mentioned German-American named Lyle Edward Goeringer, who called himself Paul K. Bryan. This senior official was involved inter alia in extensive financial money-laundering transactions through the European Union Bank in Anguilla, established by the key KGB operative and one-time junior Gorbachev Minister, Mikhail Khodorkovsky: see Addendum 7, page 701]. After doing time for a drug-rel ated car theft, Lehder (according to the version of his life promulgated for public consumption), 'decided to seek his fortune in Colombia'. In reality, after surviving for a time as a car dealer, being a German Illuminati offspring he was recruited into, or penetrated, the US intelligence community - elements of which typically seek out such corrupt personnel from the low-life criminal communities - and was despatched to Colombia to establish new US detection-free secure drug-trafficking arrangements. It seems highly unlikely that a low-life Michigan car dealer would have been entrusted with the responsibility of establishing a network of drug cartels, which is an extremely demanding brief; and much more likely that this man was a German intelligence asset fully trained for the task he was to be required to undertake. Carlos Lehder duly inaugurated, on behalf of his overt US intelligence superiors, efficient, high-tech arrangements for the mass distribution of drugs into the United States - thus declaring war against all Americans. Police office rs in New York City have told contacts of ours that they know perfectly well that elements of the US Federal Government machinery (namely, cadres within the in telligence communities) are keen to maximise opportunities to generate hidden illegal profits from mass drug transactions, the proceeds being used to mmimise the CIA's dependence upon the Congress fo r funding, and also to enrich individual operatives wherever possible. U.S. DRUG OPERATION S DESTABILISE COLOMBIA At the southernmost tip of the Bahamas, now an independent country, Lehder found a remote landing strip (Norman Cay). He secured the strip by bribing local Bahamian officials and terrorising its neighbours. Lehder then es tablished a conveyor-belt system, with jets arriving at Norman Cay loaded with cocaine, for offloadi ng and then reloading onto smaller planes for despatch into northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas (home of the central location of Scottish Rite American Freemasonry). At the time, the uninvolved elements of the US authorities were watching only the country's southern borders, so aircraft that arrived at different points well north of the border were not under surveillance. The first load that Lehder shipped in 1982 yielded $1.0 million profit for two days' work. Having tested the new arrangements, Lehder, secretly pursuing and implementing the CIA's strategy, proceeded to talk the other local drug lords into establishing a cooperative, which developed into the Medellin Cartel. At the peak of the Cartel's power, a jet loaded with up to 3 00 kg of cocaine arrived every hour at the Bahamian airstrip. By the early 1980s, Lehder operated 15 cars and trucks, three aircraft, a helicopter, 12 haciendas, an apartment building and nine other properties, including a huge Bavarian-style tourist complex in Armenia City, Colombia, together with drug assets everywhere. As in the Soviet Union, when US intelligence operatives become excessively greedy and forget who they are supposed to be working for, they are typically cut down to size. In Lehder's case, the primary problem was that the violence he spawned was"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs disproportionate, and furthermore left the US intelligence community in serious danger of reprisals ('blowback') from Colombia - which would have been inconvenient, given the country's reserves of oil and of course its endless pipeline of supplies of drugs which provides the colossal hidden reserves of th e CIA with constant replenishment. Yet the American authorities never charged Lehder with murder - merely with drug dealing and money laundering - even though acts of viol ence conducted on Lehder's behalf were documented in a US Fe deral detention order compiled in 1987. Specifically, the US authoriti es stated that Lehder and others were responsible for assassinating the Colombian Justice Minister in 1984; for the armed attack in 1985 on the Colombian Supreme Court buildi ng that killed 11 justices and 84 others; for the assas- sination of two newspaper editors in Colombia and 26 other journalists; for the shooting of Colombia's Ambassador to Hungary in 1987; and for a long list of murders of street police officers, informants and Colombian Government officials. Given this murderous litany, it ought to st rike anyone who is not sitting on their brains, as astonishing that Carlos Lehder Riva s was not retained in Colombia, tried for all these dreadful crimes, and executed. The reason this did not happen was that Lehder was a key US intelligence operative, and his services might be required by the criminal elements of the US Government at a later date: which they were. LEHDER CONTACTS HIS SUPERIORS Despite his integration within US intelligence, Carlos Lehder considered his own self- acquired power to be so great that at one stage he threatened to kill one US Federal Judge every week if he was ever caught. This threat, typical of an operative with the mentality of a Nazi, prompted US officials to put narcotics agents, their families and other officials on worldwide alert after his arrest. During Lehder's trial in 1988, US Marshals were parked outside the homes of prosecutors and other agents involved in Lehder's case. Why did the US authorities react in such an extreme manner to this man's odiously threatening behaviour, which they should never have tolerated? The answer to this question is that, although he was regarded as extremely dangerous, not least because of everything he knew about nefarious US drug-running operations out of Latin America, Lehder was a covert foreign operative who exer cised control and power as a consequence of his status vis-a-vis Illuminati colleagues at high levels within the US intelligence and other structures. He qualified for special treatment, and his power had to be respected. When he uttered that threat, the US authorities knew that he was ruthless enough to carry it out, and had supporters in high places who would or might cover up for him. Because of this status, the Government established a deal with Lehder from the very outset of his incarceration. Instead of being held in Florida where he was to be tried, Lehder was housed in a two-cell unit at the US penitentiary at Marion, Illinois, and was provided with a telephone, as well as ma ny other conveniences. Once ensconced there, he used his leverage within the US intelligence community to contact aides to George Bush Sr., the allege d DVD king-pin, whose hand has allegedly been seen in all these events from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy onwards. During the following 18 months, senior FBI, CIA and other investigating agencies interviewed Carlos Lehder in the comfort of his prison cell. But Robert Merkle, the prosecutor, knew nothing of these contacts with the US intelligence community. Although Lehder boast ed of possessing sensitive information about corrupt governments throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 155 Lehder testified only in the case of Noriega - and, as Merkle said, his testimony was wholly superfluous, contributing nothing of relevance to the Prosecution's case. In the autumn of 1995, Lehder complained that he was the victim of a double-cross. In a letter he wrote to US District Judge William Hoeveler of Miami, who had presided over the Noriega case, Lehder asked to recant his testimony because he said that the US Government had reneged on a deal whereby his sentence would have been reduced further - to 30 years. Such a sentence reduction would have made him eligible for extradition to Colombia or Germany. Within weeks of that letter being sent, according to several protected witnesses consulted by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for an article published on 26th May 1996, Lehder was whisked away into the night. Consulted by the newspaper, neither Colombian nor German officials said they knew where he was. Robert Merkle is on record as saying that 'I know that Lehder, right after he was arrested, tried to cut a deal directly with [form er Vice-President George H. W.] Bush and the FBI.... There's a lot of stuff that went on that was very questionable. I have been speculating for years that Lehder was free but I figured he'd be in Germany or a tax haven with his money, which he still has. One of the major things that was agreed in terms of indicating that he made a deal, was that Lehder wasn't required to turn over assets'. In 1996, Merkle had commented publicly that Lehder 'received a very large quid for a very small quo'. Why wasn't Lehder required to disgorge his drug proceed assets? Because he was an intelligence officer cont rolled ultimately by Germany's ultra-covert continuing Nazi Intern ational intelligence se rvice, DVD. Carlos Lehder was an Illuminati operative whose true allegiance was to Germany, not the United States. U.S. TREASURY CONFIRMS LEHDER'S 'OVERT' STATUS A certain glamorous operative, Coral Talave ra Baca, who ostensibly became Lehder's wife, was reported in a US Treasury document co mpiled by a Secret Service agent to have begun hiding Lehder's financial assets when aged 23 in 1987, the year that Lehder was captured - inter alia in a Bohemian company called Capital Investment Group (CIG). The Treasury report also stated that Carlos Lehde r was an employee of the US Treasury, and a free man. The US analyst/investigator Michael Ruppert later discovered that Talavera was employed by the American International Group (AIG), the huge and since scandal-ridden US insurance group, at Two Rincon Center, San Francisco. The American insurance industry is notoriously corrupt and is believed to be in receipt of vast inflows of laundered drug money annually. The biggest supplier of funds and controller of this industry in the United States and overseas is allegedly the so-called super- stock market guru, Warren Buffett, who allegedly launders funds inter alia for clients known as the 'hofjuden', or highly pl aced Jewish/Khazar wealth-holders. On 11th September 2001, Buffe tt was at a business meet ing convened at Offutt Air Force Base, to which location President George W. Bush Jr. was flown in Air Force One, after he had finished reading that notoriously occultic story about a goat to some schoolchildren. Offutt is the base at which the President of the United States has access to certain crucial operational facilities. AIG has had close ties to the Central Intelligence Agency since the 1950s. One can draw one's own conclusions. AIG has also been linked closely with the long notorious Arkansas Development Financial Authority (ADFA) and Goldman Sachs, headed by Mr Robert Rubin, later US Treasury Secretary under President Clinton. During the 1990s, Goldman Sachs and the allegedly corrupt Harvard Endowment Fund channelled vast resources (as much as"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"156 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs $300 billion) to Russia. On 1st December 198 7, Goldman Sachs distributed a confidential Memorandum concerning the projected establishment offshore, in Barbados, of a reinsurance company (yet another prospectiv e laundering vehicle) called Coral Re, using the first name of the glamorous beauty an d operative who became Lehder's wife. All potential investors, including Ruppert says, the State of Arka nsas' ADFA, were requested to return or destroy the Memorandum if they were not intending to take part. Coral Re was an offshoot of AIG, and of course ADFA was at the centre of numerous allegations of money- laundering operations connected with the Mena Regional Airport (Arkansas) drug delivery centre associated with the Iran-Contra series of interlinked covert intelligence programmes in the 1980s. Maurice Greenberg, now the ex-C hief Executive Officer of AIG, had been a candidate for appointment as the CIA's Director of Central Intelligence in 1995, revealing his importance as an alleged money-launderer for the intelligence community. Indeed, it has hardly been necessary for the covert Soviets to despatch their criminalism operatives into Western structures in order to corrode and collapse them from within, since the corrupted CIA has been doing just that for years. EVIDENCE OF SOVIET CONNECTIONS Ruppert, who is former policeman with a gene rally respected investigative record, and is probably an operative himself (so that what he reports has to be put through a coun- terintelligence wringer before being considered 'reliable'), reported in 2001 that he per- sonally investigated Capital Investment Gro up (CIG) in San Francisco, and established from the entity's corporate f ilings that the company had been located at 601 Gateway Boulevard near San Francisco Airpor t until their filings ceased in 1997. Michael Ruppert further reported that he had personally 'poked around' the building until he could find someone on the building staff who had been there in the mid-1990s. 'Oh yeah', said one of the building's empl oyees, 'the Russians. There was Boris and Vladimir and Natasha. They treated the eighth fl oor like it was Russian territory.... They had so many extensions running and so many com puters going that they blew the fuses in the building six times. Everybody was complaining about them. They left us in 1996, I think. I have no idea where they went after that'. LEHDER FUNDS TO PAY OFF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE In April 2005, an impeccably kn owledgeable US source informed the Author that when Al Gore alighted from a limousine in 2000 conv inced that he had won the Presidential Election that year, he was staggered to be in formed by a senior re presentative of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that, no, there had been a computer glitch, and his victory was far from assured. The source informed us that James Baker HI had allegedly been in touch with Carlos Lehder in jail, and had requested that he hand over a large sum of money immediately, in exchange for his freedom. It transpired that Le hder procured $40 million from a bank, on being driven there, of which some $8.0 million was allegedly deployed to pay off officials for them to erase all trace of Lehde r having ever been at the prison facility in question, while $32 ($32.2?) million was allegedly transferred, not to Al Gore, but to the Democratic National Committee. Carlos Lehder Rivas was then conveyed to Germany. It is clear, therefore, that Lehder was (is) a German DVD operative who worked within the corrupted US intelligence community, to establish key drug distribution networks as official US covert policy in Latin America, ostensibly on behalf of the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 157 Illuminati, providing as always cover for th e DVD. Like a number of operatives who have been working 'inside' the US intelligence community - since one consequence of interpenetration is that 'we are all good friends now' - Lehder may have had a STASI (East German) controller or handler. But the STASI, too, have all along provided cover for the Nazi International's secret 'Bl ack' intelligence service, based at Dachau, the DVD. In his 'Prison Note' [reproduced on page 97] the Office of Naval Intelligence officer 'Mike' Delmart Vreeland incorporated the following cryptic remark: 'No comments on Lehder - No thank you. No comments'. His Note was prepared for submission to his superiors in a 37-page report in which he intended to indicate what he would reveal in exchange for US intervention to procure hi s release from custody, freedom to live in his own apartment in Ottawa, and a new ID. It will be recalled that Lehder started his criminal existence as a small-time drug dealer in Michigan, the same area from which the very similar character Vreeland emerged. Vreeland's unexplained comment about refusing to answer any questions that might be put to him about Carlos Lehder begs a sizeable number of questions, and if Lehder's legend is based on fact could also be related to the possibility that the two may have known each other or even collaborated in Mich igan in their early years, so that Vreeland would have been well aware how dangerous Lehder was and is. But the Author discounts this interpretation, in favour of the likelihood that Vreeland, who is from a l ong-established US-Dutch Illuminati family, knew whom Lehder really worked for, and understood his importance to the Dluminati and thus to German 'Black' intelligence. Vreeland's generational Illuminati family background woul d explain his reluctance to be interrogated on drug-running issues connected with Carlos Lehder's operations in Latin America, since Vreeland's speciality seems to have been the 'former' USSR. His reluctance to talk a bout Lehder also suggests his knowledge of links between Lehder's former activities and not only German 'Black' intelligence, but also Soviet Military Intelligence, which is known to have been penetrated by the Abwehr/DVD. The Russian language note, surfaced by Vreeland, from Uday Hussein addressed to Putin [Figure 24, page 97], and dated June 2000, served the function of implicating Soviet intelligence in 9/11, to divert US and British intelligence from identifying the reality that the 9/11 atrocities attributed to Al-Qaeda were instigated by the DVD, from Dachau. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ILLU MINATI INTELLIGENCE DRUG-RUNNING If Lehder, as his name suggests, is also of Jewish extraction, there may further have been a connection with Israeli intelligence - with whom the CIA has collaborated, as has been seen, in Latin America. One confirmation of this was contained in William Tyree's Complaint, where he stated that 'in Febr uary and March 1976, a second and third WATCHTOWER operatio n took place under the command of Colonel Edward Cutolo, and more cocaine was brought into Albrook Air Station, Panama. [Tyree]... saw the CIA officer Edwin Wilson, CIA officer Frank Terpil , CIA asset/officer Colonel Albert V Carone, and Israeli Colonel Michael Harari'. Israeli, British and South African operatives were reported in June 2005 46 to be engaged on behalf of the Pentagon on 'above top secref operations under the umbrella codenamed Task Force 121 (TF 121), using special operations personnel in the US Army's Delta Force, Green Berets, Navy SEALS, British Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) and various ex-US and foreign intelligence personnel, to undertake illegal kidnappings, assassinations of foreign political leaders and figures, drug-run-"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"158 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs ning, and other destabilising operations abroad under cover of the 'the war against terror', which is of course carefully orchestrated. Br itish Special Forces had b een joined by South African Reece Commandos and Israeli Sayaret Mat'kal operatives. These cadres were said to be operating under the authority of the US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, the Undersecretary for Intelligence, Stephen Cam bone (the veteran opera tive) and the Deputy Undersecretary for Intelligence, Lieutenant General William G. Boykin. Th ese Pentagon- controlled units, operating primarily out of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were reported to be active in Latin America, especially in Colombia, where they have been linked to the smuggling of cocaine in order to finance 'off-the-books' operations being carried out by the Pentagon commandos. In April 2005, five US military operatives were arrested by Colombian authorities for attempting to smuggle cocaine on a m ilitary flight to Texas. A month later, two further US troops were arrested in Colo mbia for attempting to smuggle 32,000 rounds of ammunition destined for Colombian counter-narcotics units, to the right-wing paramilitary terrorist and drug smuggling group calling itself the Self Defense For ces of Colombia. The US Ambassador to Colombia , William Wood, reportedly refused to extradite the US military operatives back to Colombia, invoking the US-Colombia Treaty which apparently grants US military personnel diplomatic immunity. In other words, what was happening in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s is happening in the 21st century: there has been no change in US official drug-running beha viour and operations in Latin America: none whatsoever. CIA/DVD-MEDELLIN MONEY-LAUNDERING NEXUS According to an informed source, in the late 1970s, Jeb Bush (n ow Governor of Florida, with a Colombian Jewish wife), was installed as head of the Venezuela branch of Texas Commercial Bank, a principal owner of which was Mr George Herbert Walker Bush ('Sr.'). This bank branch allegedly became a staging post for the mass laundering of proceeds from the Medellin Cartel which, as we have seen, was controlled by the US Treasury and secret DVD (Dachau) Nazi intelligence operative Carlos Lehder. In fact the Cartel was, according to this very source, 'co-founded by Carlos Le hder as a Bush family business partner'. The source elaborates that this drug cartel 'was part of the whole CIA operation into the Southern States of the United States, headquartered, in part, at an airport in Western Arkansas, at Mena. The Elder Bush, his sons Jeb and George W, and Ollie North, and Bill Clinton, were all part of the operation. Guns were smuggled by CIA flights to Central America with side-trips to Colombia to pick up huge shipments of cocaine, which supported the Colombian economy more than coffee'. The resulting massive profits were deployed to finance further clandestine operations and scams associated with the ongoing intelligence corruption pipeline known as the Tran-Contra Affair'. The distinguished late US investigative journalist Sherman Skolnick reported from Chicago on 24th August 2001 that, while working at the Press Office of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Chandra Levy (who, like Monica Lewinski, was an Isr aeli intelligence officer) may have stumbled upon detailed information linking the Bush Family to the Oklahoma City bombing and/or to the Family's partnership with the so-called 'Colombian' drug baron Carlos Lehder. Another transmission point for the vast flow of drug proceeds arising from these criminalist US intelligence operations was alle gedly the very small First National Bank of Mena, Arkansas, which was bought by the 'ethnic Chinese' Riady family, also"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 159 linked to the Bush family and Bill Clinton. This bank allegedly became a transmission point for the colossal dope cashflow which was then allegedly transferred up to Garfield Ridge Trust and Savings Bank, Chicago. Its principal shareholder for many years was US Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. Likewise the Chicago bank's Board Chairman was for many years an alleged former US Secret Service (i.e., US Treasury) official, Dan Shannon. For his part, Rostenkowski was closely aligned to the key Chicago financial markets - the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board Options Exchange - which allegedly provided, of course, the next stage in the laundering process. In 1994, Rostenkowski was indicted on corruption charges and stepped down as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, losing his seat in that year's Congressional elections. In 1996, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, was fined, and served a 17-month sentence. It may be helpful here to recap some of the main findings arising from this study. With respect to the intelligence on US drug-running operations in Latin America that have been considered to date, the following facts have been established: 1. Carlos Lehder Rivas, who masqueraded as a Colombian drug dealer, was in fact a US Treasury/CIA intelligence operative sent to Colombia to organise, rationalise and then control the flow of drugs from Colombia (and Bolivia and Peru to an extent) into the United States, and to arrange appropriate money-laundering facilities. As well as being a US Treasury operative he was a deep cover agent of the German secret ongoing Nazi Black intelligence organisation, DVD, Dachau. 2. An ongoing covert Soviet and a possible STASI involvement have been identified. The STASI label has always been in part a cover for the Nazi International's DVD. 3. The Central Intelligence Agency is as usual shown to be a cynical criminal organisation masquerading as an intelligence community, and financing its operations from drug-trafficking - to the severe detriment of the population it 'serves', just like its covert Soviet counterpart. It has recently been reconfirmed to the Author at the highest level that the CIA is financially independent of Congress - as indeed is perfectly obvious from all the research he has been conducting in this area of the enquiry. 4. It follows that the intelligence services are long since out of control, in control, and need to be brought decisively under control if this crisis is ever to be surmounted. Ralph McGhee, who was a CIA operative for 25 years, mainly in Southeast Asia, where he witnessed US bombing and napalming of villages and of their inhabitants, has pointed out that 'the CIA is not now, nor has it ev er been, a Central Intelligence Agency'. It is the covert action arm of the President's fo reign policy advisers. In that capacity it overthrows or supports foreign governments while reporting 'intelligence' justifying those activities. It shapes its intelligence, even in such critical areas as Soviet nuclear weapons capability, to support presidential policy. Disinformation is part of its covert action responsibility and the American people are the primary target of its lies'. Since at least the Vietnam War era, the CIA has been at the forefront of heroin trafficking. In addition to being the main source of US propaganda for domestic and foreign consumption - hence, inter alia, the proliferation of conflicting disinformation and diversionary US Information Warfare websites, many of which are controlled by a central apparatus, the Author has been told [see Note 3, Chapter 7, page 512] - the CIA is indeed the covert arm of the predatory US Illuminist Government, and has accordingly been engaged traditionally in many terrorist operations. In fact, the CIA is itself a terrorist organisation, funded primarily by the profits of drug-smuggling. President"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"160 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs Bush Jr.'s 'war on international terrorism' provides (or is de facto supposed to provide) the United States with cover for its own terrorist activities, some of which have already been alluded to here. The CIA's serious drug-running activities were pioneered in and prior to the Vietnam Era by the Jewish Meyer Lans ky Syndicate operating out of Chicago, which had already established international heroin running operations from Southeast Asia via the CIA-linked Corsican Mafia in the Mediterra nean (Corsica being a particularly nasty little island where a bed-and-breakfast hostess once refused to hand the Author back his passport so that he could leave, without a corrupt payment). The atmosphere in Corsica reeks of the French Mafia. The US intelligence community has been 'off the rails' for decades. The stench of this criminal organisation's activities reeks in the nos trils not only of informed American people, but of the whole world. At Watergate, for instance, President Richard Nixon was discarded in order to cover up CIA money-laundering. The key 'smoking gun' tape revealed Nixon's acceptance of the need to mobilise the CIA to halt the FBI's Watergate investigation because the FBI had 'run into' a CIA covert operation. When asked why he thought it was a CIA operation, the FBI Director of the day commented: 'Because of the amount of money involved'. The lesser-known Watergate burglars were mainly from the ranks of Cubans associated with the CIA's Miami station. Watergate had much wider connotations, not least involving the Israeli nuclear programme, which are not relevant here. The verdict of H. R. Haldeman, referring to a Mexican bank used for laundering relevant funds, is however pertinent to this analysis: 'If the Mexican bank connection was actually a CIA cover operation all along, unknown to Nixon; and Nixon was destroyed for asking the FBI to stop investigating the bank because it might uncover a CIA operation (which the Helms Memo seems to indicate that it actually was after all), the multiple layers of deception by the CIA are astounding'* 7 . They reflected, and reflect, of course, 'the mystery of iniquity'. The main point here is that the CIA was heavily engaged in money laundering (as it had been in earlier years as well) in the 1970s: and the central figure, as has been the case ever since, was George Bush Sr.. But behind George Bush stood his mentor - the senior Illuminati operative, German Jew and alleged me mber of the secret Illuminati Directorate, Dr Henry ('Henny') Kissinger, the alleged DVD agent who persuaded the Illuminati's President Ford to give Bush Sr. William Colby's job. As has been alluded to, Dr Kissinger is allegedly a long-term Soviet agent, whose Soviet codename is BOR, as well as being allegedl y a mole for the DVD. His presence at the epicentre or environment of US governance for decades, and his relationship with and influence over George Bush Sr., have provided ample scope for foreign manipulation of, and interference in, the affairs of, the United States, which has reached epidemic proportions. But the question is: which foreign power does Dr Kissinger allegedly serve? Given his mentorship of George Bush Sr. and his German provenance, the answer to this question suggests itself unequivocally: and soundings among high-level intelligence circle have indicated that this assessment is correct. If so, then Dr Kissinger's 'outer defence' - rumours of his Soviet allegiance, 'corroborated' by his Soviet code-name BOR - mask his actual, deeper allegiance to the Nazi International in general, and to the Dachau-based DVD 'Black', hidden intelligence community, in particular. Another cover employed by DVD operatives, as has been seen, is the 'former' East German STASI label. Manipulation of high-ranking US political figures is facilitated by the institutionalisation in such circles of vice of every kind, and their foolish attendance"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 161 THE BOHEMIAN GROVE: WHER E THE ELITE ARE FILMED IN DEBAUCHERY FOR BLACKMAIL For the past 130 years [as of 2005], world leader s and members of the US elite have travelled to Sonoma County, Northern California, in July, to participate in orgies and occult activities on a secluded 2,700 acre compound called the Bohemian Grove. On 15th July 200 0, the US talk show host, Alex Jones, and colleagues, including a British contingent, managed to penetrate the notorious Bohemian Grove by clandestine means, and to film some of the repulsive activities that were taking place during this annual summer camp of llluminati. Bohemian Grove is the site of an annual two-we ek gathering of prominent males, with partici pants having included the likes of Henry Kissinger, James Baker III, David Rockefeller, John Lehman, Elliot Richardson, Newt Gingrich, George Bush Sr. and Jr ., Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Helmut Schmidt, General Colin Powell, Richard Cheney, Gerald Fo rd, William Simon, Ronald Reagan, William French Smith, and William Perry, former Secretary of Defense under Clinton, also a known participant. Participation in this 2,700-member club, founded in 1872 amid a certai n amount of mystery, may entail a wait of 15 years before coveted admission is granted. Herbert Hoover once referred to the Bohemian Club's Annual Summer Encampment as 'the greatest men's party on earth'. In reality, Bohemian Grove events celebrate and institutionalise 'the spirit of Bohemia', according to Peter Phillips, of Sonoma State University, who actually wrote a doctoral thesis on the Grove. Bohemia is of course in Germany: so what this means is that the llluminati, which in its modern format originated in Germany, indulge in pagan occult rituals, permissive sex and various abominations, the mildest of which is an occult ceremony beneath a huge idol in the shape of an owl, called Moloch - the Caananite god to which the pagan tribes, and at times the children of Israel, sacrificed 'unwanted children' (postnatal contraception). In 'Paradise Lost', John Milton described Moloch as follows: 'First Moloch, horrid King, besmirched with blood, Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears, Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud, Their children's cries unheard, that passed through fire, To his grim idol'. In Sc ripture, Moloch is condemned as the worst of all the ancient abominations: but the llluminati 'Useful Idiots' attendi ng the grim, pagan ceremony held at the Bohemian Grove every summer, revere it, reaffirming before it their Luciferian preferences. Programmed 'Monarch' sex slaves are routinel y employed to 'entertain' the assembled debauched members of the globalist elite, and to fa cilitate the gratif ication of their animal desires. The annual gathering of these nutcases begins with the so-called 'Cremation of Care' ritual, in which a mascot is burned in effigy, symbolising 'freedom from care - a trap for the unwary. Various bizarre enactments take place. Druids in red-hooded robes march in procession and chant to the Great Owl Moloch, according to many inside reports obtained not only as a consequence of Alex Jones' penetration in 2000, but also from the scores of local men who work in the Grove as servants. One near-victim has described the Bohemian Grove's inner hi deaways and secret locations - which include an UNDERGROUND (U.N. derground), a Dark Room, a Leather Room, and a Necrophilia Room. Occult human sacrificial rituals, involving the murder of babies, children and 'discarded' sex slaves, have also been credibly reported, given a sizeable accumulation of insider information about this place of serial abominations. Cathy O'Brien, the 'Monarch' sex slave deprogrammed by Mark Phillips, has identified the underlying evil purpose of the Bohemian Grove as BLAC KMAIL. She reported that her 'handler' had told her about high-tech, undetectable cameras using fibe r-optics, and fish-eye lens cameras that are positioned strategically in each of the Bohemian Gr ove's numerous sexual perversion theme rooms. She has reported that 'I was programmed to function in all rooms at the Bohemian Grove in order to compromise specific government targets according to their personal perversions'. That's how Luciferian US intelligence does its business. She and Phillips calculated that no-one would believe what they have divulged in their book Trance Formation of America' [s ee main text], in which these comments were published, unless they were dead. This calculation proved to be correct. At the same time, neither replied to the Author's letter enquiring whether Mark Phillips was actually engaged in an experiment to establish whether a programmed (MK-ULTRA-style) 'Monarch' sex-slave could be successfully and permanently deprogrammed; and when one receives no response from such operatives, this normally means that the questions put to them cannot be answered without compromising their operations: i.e., the Author's suspicion is correct. ■"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"162 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs at annual Bohemian Grove events [see page 161], at which they are encouraged to indulge in sexual, drug and drinking excess, and which they are erroneously informed cannot or will never be exposed. However the real purpose of the Bohemian Grove orgies is precisely to ensure participants they can be manipula ted through blackmail, since secret cameras witness their debauched behaviour, of which they are discreetly reminded 'as necessary'. Reverting to the case of Dr Kissinger, the trad itional, long-term penetration of the Soviet intelligence sector by German Nazi 'Black' operatives provides the known context for this operative's use of his suspected Soviet connecti ons as cover for his real affiliation - service to the Nazi International. At this point, we can hear some argue that any such allegiance would be surreal, since, as a Jew, Dr Kissinger would be 'sure' to be antagonistic towards Nazism. However, that would be a shallow, knee-jerk reaction. For the reality is that Zionism is a form of Nazism. In his early working days, the Author foolishly joined a Jewish merchant bank in London, for which he was to tally unsuited. There, a much older woman who worked in the same department took pity on him, and 'looked after' him in the canteen at lunchtime. The Eichmann trial was the main feature in the news at the time. The Author remembers saying to this kind lady: 'How come Eichmann, a Jew, presided over the Holocaust?' To which she replied: 'Don't you know that a Jew's greatest enemy is another Jew?'. That first-hand remark should, though a cliche, eliminate any fanciful notion that Dr Kissinger could not possibly be, for instance, a covert DVD operative. On the contrary, his clear Illuminati credentials, and the fact that he is alleged to have been thrown out of his synagogue by his local Jewish community, clarify this man's geopolitical orientation and loyalties. A 'handle' on this man's nature can be obtained by contemplating the fact that, after appearing incongruously as a mourner at Princess Diana's Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey, Kissinger was observed the next evening in a London nightclub, ogling at a Turkish belly-dancer. CYNICAL U.S. DECEPTION OF COLOMBIA Now that we can see clearly that the Mede llfn cartel was controlled by, and was an instrument of, US intelligence, manipulated or probably even commanded in turn by at least one German Nazi covert operative, who a ppears to have been whisked away from Colombia by the DEA and quickl y incarcerated 'for his own safety', it can also be seen that the Colombian Government, while benefiting financially, has been cynically deceived by the US Government, of which the vast US intelligence community forms an overbearingly powerful component. If we pursue this line of reasoning further, a number of disturbing insights emerge. The Cali Cartel replaced the Medellin Cartel; and just like the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel has been, and is, clandestinely controlled by a foreign power - namely, the United States. During his heyday operating in Colombia, Lehder financed the establishment of a newspaper and a new political party, the Movimiento Nacional Latino. His colleague, Pablo Escobar, founded a newspaper, and was elected to the Colombian Congress in 1982. By the following year, Escobar's personal wealth was estimated at $2 billion. He proceeded to finance the construction of a barrio for poor fam ilies in Medellin - a 'philanthropic' gesture typical of successful giga-criminals the world over. In mid-1983, Tranquilandia, which was then the largest cocaine laboratory in history, went into production on the banks of the Rio Yari in Los Llanos. It operated no less than fourteen independent, fully equipped laboratories, water and electri city supply, roads, dormitories, and its own airstrip, and it produced 3,500 kg of pure cocaine every month."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 163 When the Colombian President of the day, Belisario Betancour, appointed Rodrigo Lara Bonilla Minister of Justice, the political climate abruptly changed. Bonilla suddenly launched a sharp offensive against the drug trade, inducing one of Bogota's leading newspapers, El Espectador, to publicise some of the crimes committed by Pablo Escobar. In March 1984, a massive Colombian Police posse raided Tranquilandia and arrested everyone working there. The police proceeded to confiscate seven aircraft, weapons and vehicles, plus all the chemicals on the prem ises. (These chemicals are typically manu- factured by only a handful of corporations, of which Eli Lilly, with which George Bush Sr. has or has had key connections, is one). Fourteen tonnes of cocaine were reportedly seized and thrown into the river. THE U.S.-TRIGGERED COLOMB IAN COCAINE CIVIL WAR The Cartel disappeared from view, with the exception of Carlos Lehder, who offered, in exchange for immunity from prosecution, to pay off Colombia's entire foreign debt, then standing at $13 billion. After agonised consideration, this proposal was turned down by the Government. However once the publicity had died down, the Medellfn Cartel continued business more or less as usual. In particular, it began to invest its profits in land, and later in industry. Then, as the drug operatives became major landowners, they created their own private armies to protect their investments. In 1984, Lehder or associates in or working for the Medellfn Cartel, killed the Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. The Government responded in an odd manner: it implemented the old Extradition Treaty, which had been signed years earlier with the United States, but had never been applied. Four minor drug traffickers were at once sent to the United States to stand trial, to maintain the illusion for public consumption that 'something is being done'. The Cartel then started a public campaign against the Treaty, but failed to shift the Government's stand. So the Cartel began to target the Treaty's leading supporters, such as Guillermo Cano, the publisher of El Especta dor, who was assassinated in late 1986. The Attorney-General was later shot to death. In Fe bruary 1987, the Colombian security forces and the anti-narcotics police, with cooperation from the US Drug Enforcement Agency, captured and immediately extradited Carl os Lehder to the United States. It is not known whether the DEA operatives were aware that they were handling an operative employed by the US Treasury and US intelligence generally - to organise and deliver a pipeline of colossal profits for the benefit of corrupt US official cadres and to inflate the vast hidden resources of the intelligence services. The consequences of the United States' secr et intermeddling in the national affairs of Colombia, and of its abominable and cynical manipulation and seizure of control over the Colombian drug trade (paralleled later, under George H. W. Bush Sr.'s Presidency, in Panama), were catastrophic. The United States literally succeeded in destabilising Colombia - which some believe may well have been an outcome not inimical to CIA planners, given that the United States is a key global revolutionary power and that it is capable of being a menace to the stability of the whole world. In August 1989, the Medellfn Cartel assassinated the leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, thereby threatening what remained of the corrupted integrity of Colombia's fragile democracy. All hell then broke loose. Galan's murder triggered a declaration of all-out war by the Government; and the United States - which had provoked the chaos from the outset - immediately offered $65 million of emergency aid and logistical support. If these funds were taken from a CIA 'Black' budget, there was of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"164 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs course no shortage of resources that could be raided for this purpose. President Barco of Colombia thereupon co nfiscated 989 buildings and ranches, 367 aircraft, 73 boats, 710 vehicles, 4.7 tonnes of cocaine, 1,279 guns and 25,000 rounds of ammunition from the Cartel's structures. The traffickers responded with a demonic reign of terror, burning the farms of re gional politicians in Antioquia, and detonating bombs at many banks, newspaper offices, political party headquarters, and private homes in B ogota, Cali, Medellin and Barranquilla. In Se ptember 1989, an explosion destroyed the offices of El Espectador. During November, a mid-air bombi ng killed all the 101 passengers and six crew members aboard an Avianca flight from Bogota to Cali. In December, a massive truck bomb ripped into the bottom floors of the National Police Agency (DAS) in Bogota, damaging buildings 20 blocks away. The war culminated in a massive manhunt that led to the killing of another prominent Cartel leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, known as 'El Mexicano', who had been suspected of masterminding the reign of te rror. After his death, the remaining Cartel leaders urged the Government to negotiate. Extended negotiations then led to the surrender of the three Ochoa brothers, and Pablo Escobar and their aides. On the face of it, the no-holds-barred dr ug war represented the consequences of yet another CIA operation, or nest of evil operations, that (as usually happens) went so badly wrong that the overt responsibl e structures of the US Federal Government had to intervene (inter alia, with the $65 million of aid). But if Colombian officials and Ministers had been properly informed, they would have been well aware that the United States had been playing extremely cynical and dangerous games in Colombia, which elements of it had been exploiting for criminal covert purposes for years. With this effective truce, the farcical character of the Colombian justice system kicked in again. The deal that was struck was that the traffickers had to surrender and plead guilty to just one crime, in exchange for guarantees that they would not be extradited like Carlos Lehder (who had simply been tran sferred back to base, albeit not in the manner he might have preferred), and they would serve reduced sentences in a specially constructed prison in Envigado, the home town of Pablo Escobar, close to Medellfn. To conclude the matter, the Constitutional Asse mbly ruled formally that the Extradition Treaty did not apply to Colombian nationals . But it manifestly continued to apply to non-Colombian nationals, like Carlos Lehder. CARTEL DECAPITATED: SO IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL With the surrender or deaths of all the to p leaders of the Medellfn cartel, guess what? Narco-terrorism subsided, but the drug busin ess remained unaffected! An estimated two or three tonnes of top quality cocaine conti nued to reach the United States every week from Colombia alone, in cargoes smuggled in by sea or air. Escobar and hi s associates were, for the time being, having to put up with the inconvenience of operating their cocaine businesses from behind bars. They all had telephones. When Pablo Escobar escaped from his jail fo llowing a 'botched' attempt to remove him from La Catedral (the prison) to a more secu re location, narco-terrorism resumed. For the next 18 months, Colombia's elite Search Block sought Escobar, tracking down and then killing most of his aides and collaborators. Finally, after 499 days of searching the special unit located Escobar in December 1993, and shot him dead. However thanks to US intermeddling and the parallel activities of Cuban and Soviet- linked rival drug networks, drug trafficking out of Colombia has continued"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 165 expanding. For while Colombia's elite force concentrated its resources in hunting one man, the other cartels were of course quick to take advantage of the situation. The Cali Cartel, which likewise developed during the 1980s, moved quickly to take over the markets of the now shattered Medellfn Cartel, becoming Colombia's largest drug producer. And as has been explained, the Cali organisation was led by the Rodriguez Orej-uela brothers, at least one of whom was controlled by US intelligence. In other words, the German-oriented cadres within the CIA did not place their eggs in one basket, but diversified their sources of drug pipeline funds, to guard against the possibility (likeli- hood) that one or more of the networks that they had established would be blown. The problems which leaders of the Cali Ca rtel faced were quickly dissipated (see above), and by 1994, this US-s ponsored Cartel was believed to be controlling over 80% of New York's cocaine market, with dominant shares in other US and European markets. The criminalised intelligence services of both the leading revolutionary powers -the 'former' USSR and the United States - are engaged in drug offensives against their populations, in conformity with the Satanic priority of the dialectical World Revolution, to create chaos out of order. The later Cali king-pins diversified into opium poppies and into heroin, apparently reflecting changes in consumer habits in the Un ited States, but in reality catering for drug demand stimulated by supply. Meanwhile the German, French, Italian, Spanish, Mexican and Israeli 'Black' intelligence communities continued to thrive, thr ough cooperation and competition with the US and Soviet networks, as never before. The arrest in June 1995 of the Call Cartel leader, the US intelligence asset-operative Gilberto Rodriguez Orej uela, involved in excess of 3,000 troops raiding dwellings in Bogota and Cali. Yet Colombia continues to benefit from an inflow of an estimated $6 billion annually from the illegal drug operations set up originally, and controlled by, US intelligence - a factor which of course ensures that the networks established by US intel- ligence on behalf of its German Illuminati controllers continue to function normally. At the same time, Colombia's political fabric had been severely destabilised. Not only was the ruling political class targeted, but the arrest of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela did little to alter the dynamics of the Colombian drug trade: and the Government has been subsequently been unable to repeat the success it achieved against the Medellin Cartel. In other words, it was business as usual. One apparent reason for this is that the po litical classes generall y have been further corrupted. President Ernesto Samper was obliged to spend much time during his final years in office refuting allegations that his electi on campaign had been financed by drug money. President Samper's Liberal Party successor, Horacio Serpa, lost the election in June 1998 to the 'Conservative' Andres Pastrana, who in 1994 had exposed Sr. Samper's corrupt connections with the Cali Cartel. COLBY, CASEY AND IRAN-CONTRA At the risk of some repetition, but in the interests of clarity, let us briefly revisit William Casey's Affidavit, in order to draw out the main features of this sobering narrative. After William J. Casey, an old Office of Strategic Services (OSS) operative based in London during the Second World War, became the CIA's Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) on 28th January 1981 under President Ronald Reagan (in office, thanks to George Bush Sr.'s 'October Surprise' operation to bribe the Iranians with $32 million, to release the US hostages from Tehran only after Presid ent Reagan's inauguration), he was approached and briefed by the former DCI, William Colby (who was found drowned many years"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"166 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs later), who informed him off the record about two operations that he was continuing to run in Latin America. Both these operations were being run without the consent or knowledge of the US Congress, the President or even the intelligence apparatus itself. One reason for this level of secrecy was that the operations were act ually directed by covert German Nazi drug- running intelligence, with Colby unknowingly in charge. The operations were identified by Colby un der the codenames of A-6 (RED MIST) and A-7 (PROJECT SANDMAN). A-7 was the 'Phoenix Program' of Latin America, involving the assassination of the Communist infrastructure throughout La tin America. A-6 identified individuals and the build-up of the Communist threat in the region. William Colby authorised the US intelligence assets involved in A-6 and A-7 to engage in narcotics traffick ing to finance both operations, having himself engaged in similar operations in Vietnam for the same pu rpose. Between the beginning of December 1975 and 1st April 1976, Colby prepositioned more than a million pounds of cocaine in Panama, with the assistance of General Manuel Noriega. This cocaine was conveyed to El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras between 1976 and 1981. It now needed to be conveyed to the American market. CIA-MAFIA UNDERWORLD LINKS EXPOSED To assist him in these nefarious operations, Mr Colby used the aforementioned Colonel (Dr) Albert Vincent Carone, a US military intelligence officer, with experience also in working for the CIA, and close Mafia links, to field the A-6 and A-7 operations. Dr Carone had a long-time 'friend', Vito Genovese, head of the gambling and narcotics activ ities for the controlling Mafia family in New York, of which Dr Carone, who was also a friend of the international fugitive Robert Ve sco (hiding from US justice in Cuba), was made a 'member'. Thus elements of the US military, as well as the CIA, are mafiosi. Contrary to the universal view, Fidel Castro, who r eceived a Jesuit education, like so many revolutionaries and spies, has maintained secretly cordial relations with certain US structures all his life. The Americas Department of the Cuban Communist Party, run by Cuban intelligence cadres under the control of the KGB, directs all covert Soviet drug- trafficking operations in the Western Hemis phere, in 'competition' with the colossally subversive drugs offensive of the CIA' s Illuminati against their own population. William Colby arranged for the profits from the preposifioned cocaine to be laundered through Dr. Carone, the New York Mafia, a nd Robert Vesco (who has been hiding out in Cuba since his exposure). They were then to be redirected to fund the anti-Communist operations in Latin America, th rough Colby himself. Hence, Robert Vesco, the fugitive from US justice, remained at the same time a long -term money-laundering collaborator with the CIA. (As for the facts on the ground, the House of Representatives' Inte lligence Committee knew perfectly well that the Sandinistas were not shipping arms to Communist guerrillas in El Saldavor, as President Ronald Reagan had claimed. Congressman Lee Hamilton complained that 'we were, however, unable to respond to the President's (erroneous) assertions because this information was classified. The Democratic and admittedly fiercely anti-Reagan Senator Moynihan elaborated: 'I knew the President's claim could not be substantiated, but I knew this from classified briefings which a Chairman or Vice Chairman of such a committee is sworn not to discuss in public. The effect is to hide things from the American people that they need to know'). Casey discussed these matters with Dr Ca rone and accordingly decided to have the prepositioned cocaine brought into Mena Airport, Arkansas, which the CIA had"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 167 used on earlier occasions, and through whic h large volumes of cocaine had been, and would continue to be, shipped into the US interior. Assisting William Casey so as to ensure smooth operations were William J. Clinton, a CIA operative, later the President of the United States, and William E Weld [see Casey's Affi davit, and the box on page 109], the scion of a well-known banking family (White Weld having been an early adviser to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency), who later became Governor of Massachusetts and was in 2006 seeking the Governorship of New York State. As Assistant US Attorney, Weld was placed in charge of the Criminal Division of th e US Department of 'Justice'. The purpose of this appointment was so that William Weld could control investigations into Mena by the US Federal law enforcement agencies, which of course knew nothing (or not enough) about the detail of these criminal intelligence activities. Clinton assisted Casey by systematically smothering the Arkansas law enforcement investigations into the drug-running operations by the CIA through Mena. That was why Clinton was elevated to the Arkansas Governorship. William Casey now instructed Robert McFarlane, John Poindexter and Oliver North to go beyond 'normal channels' and to use 'available assets, including the Mafia', to ensure the arrival of the cocaine into Mena Airport. Personnel assigned to the National Security Agency (NSA) and the US Army Security Agency (ASA) facilitated the cocaine arrivals, with the early warning defence satellites and the radar grid being blinded to enable the cocaine-laden aircraft to land undetected at Mena Airport. The codenames for these NSA and ASA operations were SEA SPRAY and JADE BRIDGE. As we have also seen, evidently William Casey justified these criminal decisions, actions and policies by invoking the false pretext that US drug users have a choice: whether to consume drugs or not. This alibi is both morally and practically indefensible, as well as being ignorant nonsense. In the first place, as discussed, drug consumption is a consequence of supply, not demand. In the case of food for normal sustenance, such as corn flakes, there is a natural demand from the population, which is met by supply. However in the case of addictive drugs, tw o factors differentiate them from all other commodities. First, there is no natural demand fo r drugs such as cocaine. Its insidious usage spreads as a consequence solely of supply - to foolish people who are offered cocaine at parties, for instance. If the drug is available, then demand for it can be generated. If the supply is cut off, demand (except from those unfortunates who are hooked on the drug) dries up. Secondly, demand from users who have started to use the drug because of its availability (supply) is artificially and expo nentially increased becau se of the resulting addiction. It follows, obviously, that William Casey's self-interested and shallow 'justification' for continuing the de facto Illuminist strategy of his predecessor was wholly devoid of intellectual validity quite apart from its Satanic immorality. As for William Colby himself, his preo ccupation with decapitating the Communist infrastructure in Latin America may seem to have provided absolute confirmation of his anti- Communist credentials. For instance, Colby reportedly presided over nearly 25,000 assassinations in Vietnam. But the longer-term consequences of his authorisation of open- ended drug dealing by US intelligence assets have been so disastrous, and so predictable, that, if it were not for the fact that he was blinded by the dialectical trap in which he had to operate, they might have implied a subversi ve intent. They are certainly consistent with the parallel strategy devised by Dr. Kissinge r (the alleged Soviet agent BOR and German Illuminati controller) to establish the precarious system whereby oil i nvoices issued by oil producers are denominated ex clusively in US dollars."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"168 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs THE PITIFUL DRUG DECADENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM Figure 28 below shows that as opiate and cocaine supplies in the United Kingdom pro- liferated between 1970 and 2000, the numbers of dependent users of these imported drugs known to treatment services grew exp onentially. The chart may be compared with Figure 29 on page 169, in which exactly the sa me progression in the United States, between 1960 and 1980, is recorded. As has been explained, the drug crisis in the United Kingdom is now controlled by a corrupted intelligence cad re, GO-2, which \"facilitates\" the operations of two drug cartels, financing the main political parties and ensuring largely trouble-free distribution of these drugs, to the fury of drug interdiction operatives and law enforcement elements, who know what is going on. It was in this context that the Author was informed, in the third quarter of 2005, by two senior, disgusted, intelligence officers, that 'we have a criminal government in the United Kingdom'. For a component of government to preside over drug-running operations is a scandal of extreme proportions, and it is hoped that exposure inter alia via this study will serve the official perpetrators with appropriate notice that this state of affairs will not be tolerated, and that efforts will be made to bring these criminals who - as in the United States -hide behind their 'national security' screen - to justice. Furthermore, since GO-2 operates from the Lambeth headquarters of MI6, the leadership of which in 2005 was considered by the Author's informants to be unreliable (to put the matter mildly), MI6 is a party to Figure 29. New opiate and cocaine abusers in the United Kingdom, 1970-2000. Increased drug dependency reflects increased supply - which is co-ordinated by GO-2, a UK intell igence cadre which is supposed to be engaged in anti-drug operations. According to furious UK inte lligence sources, GO-2 controls or works with two drug cartels, thus frustrating drug-interdiction oper ations by the diminishing proportion of the UK intelligence community that remains uncorrupted. Note: As discussed elsewher e, GO-2 operates out of the MI6 headquarters in Lambeth, just across Vauxhall Bridge in Central London. In 2004-2005, MI6/GO-2 attempted to smear the Author, who retaliated by published a detailed account of these attempts in his global financial journal, International Currency Review."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 169 this abomination. Drug-running is a crime agai nst humanity and the Author regrets to say that the British Government condones and pa rticipates in this form of atrocity. In 2005, the cost of damage to health and social functioning due to heroin and/or crack cocaine usage was conservatively estimated at £5.0 billion annually. In the United Kingdom, drug users were estimated to commit no less than 36,000,000 crimes a year, that is to say, 56% of the (colossal) total number of crimes. The British police have long since given up bothering to find the perpetrators of crimes, unless murder, rape or some other high-profile aberration is involved. The noti on that British taxpayers receive value for money, in the form of protection, from the police, is wholly discredited. When the Author sought to advise the authorities of a possible terrorism dimension, he struggled to make himself understood to a half-literate police cl erk at Belgravia Police Station, who made so many mistakes that he kept pulling sheets out of his record book and starting over again. A day and a half later, there had been no follow-up, despite the urgency of the matter; and the Author was reduced to calling th e Downing Street Press Office, as a result of which a Scotland Yard officer telephoned to make an appointment. In general, the police service is dismal, and morale appears to be low - doubtless because the police know that the Government is itself involved in drug-running. The Author's UK intelligence sources estimate that Britain now has 300,000 heroin addicts, compared with 30, 000 in 1972, when Britain was illegally 'bounced' into Figure 29. New cocaine users in the United States, 1962-80 [in thousands], showi ng conclusively the correlation with with increased supplies of the drug.

Despite the fact that GO-2/MI6 'facilitates' the drug-running and distribution operations of two drug cartels into and within the United Kingdom, available data on the UK drug crisis are provided, believe it or not, by the Downing Street Strategy Unit. Whether this curious fact reflects ignorance on the part of the apparatchiks working there, with respect to the abominations perpetrated fro m Lambeth, or whether we are confronted with the 'blind eye' syndrome, or one part of the official structures having no clue what is happening in other areas of the Government, is unknown. But according to this source, the total heroin and/or crack user population in Britain had reached 280,000 by mid-2005 (the numbers are not additive), with an estimated 260,000 people hooked on heroin, 140,000 users of crack, and 250,000 people addicted on cocaine. The estimated average annual spend per heroin addict was £10,000 - which means that cash-flow generated by this abomination alone was of the order of £2.6 billion. The estimated 140,000 crack users were also spending about £10,000 annually on their vice, generating a further £1.4 billion; while the 250,000 cocaine users were spending some £5,500 each, generating a further £1.4 billion annually - for a total annual inflow of £5.4 billion. The Table on page 171 provides further details of the size of the scam - sugges ting that 31 retail tonnes of heroin, 10 tonnes of crack and 22 tonnes of cocaine were flooding into the United Kingdom a nnually, implying that interdiction operations are totally ineffective. To ensure that this is indeed the case, the Blair Government abolished the ancient Customs and Excise Department, which had made progress with its interdiction activities - merging the department into the notoriously incompetent Inland Revenue. The Author's informants advise that this was done, in part, in order to remove the annoyance Figure 30. The cost of drugs per week for a UK heavy abuser. Usage of crack cocaine, cocaine and heroin was conservatively estimated in mid-2005 to be generating at least £5.4 billion annually. Taking the use of other drugs into account, the conservative estimate would be of the order of £7.0 billion annually. However analysts believe that the actual cash-flow generated as a consequence of the permissive supply of drugs into the United Kingdom could be much higher. Usage follows supply, not the other way round. The Government cynically maximises the potential for cash-flow generation by means of National Health Service prescription of methadone for heroin addicts, so that when released from treatment, they revert to heroin usage."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 171 of Customs seizures, so as to allow this lucr ative trafficking in human misery, to expand unim- peded. It appears to be 'justified' by the same dishonest argument that is used in the United States and was spelled out by William Casey in his Affidavit. With the two main political parties hooked into this criminalised system, Britain is rapidly cascading downwards into the same abyss as the United States; and hardly a single prominent voice is heard in Westminster, on the BBC, or anywhere except sometimes in the columns of 'The Guardian' newspaper, complaining about this disgraceful, scandalous and abhorrent state of affairs. When the Author asked informants whether contenders for the leadership of the British Conservative Party were liable to 'go along' with this scandal, he was informed that David Davis deplores this abuse. But does anyone else? One or more senior figures are reported to be addicted to crack cocaine. Ignorance in Britain, not least in media circles, concerning the clandestine official forces that are engaged in drug-trafficking is almost universal. On 5th July 2005, extensive publicity was given to a report by Lord Birt, th e former Director General of the BBC, who is paid by the Prime Minister to 'think ahead' on behalf of the Downing Street Strategy Unit, which exposed the extent to which the British Government's purported anti-drugs policy had failed. The report effectively stated that the result of the 'war against drugs' so far had been a massive increase in consumption. The massive increase in consumption was facilitated by GO-2/MI6, but of c ourse this fact, of which Lord Birt, in fairness, may have been ignorant, was never mentioned. If an allusion to the possible involvement of Britain's own intelligence cadres in drug-trafficking and facilitating the operations of two drug cartels was included in Lord Birf s original draft, any such reference had been removed by the time the document was made available for public consumption. If Lord Birt had consulted the right people in the intelligence community, we would certainly have learned about this abomination. Lord Birt employed management consulta ncy-speak and semi-spurious quantifying techniques to describe the Government's failure on this score, illustrated by the report's finding that traffickers into the British market enjoy such high profits that seizure rates of 60%-80% are needed in order for there to be any impact on the flow of drugs into the country - whereas nothing greater than 20% has ever been achieved. The document was presented in full to the Prime Minister in June 2003. On 1st July 2005, following action under the new British Freedom of Information Act, only 52 of its 105 pages were published. Release took place on the eve of the ghastly 'New World Order' 'Live 8 'concert', a mass mind- manipulation and propaganda fest fronted by a character called Sir Bob Geldof who seems to be 'licensed' from on high to mastermind such mass psychology operations. By publishing the document immediately ahead of that event, the authorities had hoped that its findings would be 'buried'; so 'The Guardian', which is seized of the Government's propensity to play such routine dirty tricks, cleared its front page on 5th July 2005 to provide maximum coverage to the report, which was supposed UK DRUG USAGE ESTIMATES*: MID-2003 These estimates are conservative* HEROIN CRACK COCAINE Estimated user numbers [data not additive] 260,000 140,000 250,000 Estimated average annual spend per user £10,000 £10,000 £5,500 Annual cash-flow generated per year £2,600,000,000 £1,400,000,000 £1,400,000,000 Price per gram £60.00 £105.00 £60.00 Derived retail tonnes consumed per annum 31 10 22 Estimated UK usage and spending on heroin, crack and cocaine.

In December 2005, Lord Birt brought forth Phase Two of his analysis, entitled 'Diagnoses and Recommendations', which remained unpublished when this study went to press. The half of the Phase One report that was not published, but was nevertheless leaked to 'The Guardian', cont ained a scathing verdict on UK o fficial operations to disrupt the drugs supply chain. This was the nearest that Lord Birt felt able to go (or his official censors would allow him to go) in drawing public attention to the fact that Britain has a criminal government. The 'missing' information summarised by the newspaper concluded that the estimated UK annual supply of he roin and cocaine, which it said could be transported into the country in five stan dard-sized shipping containers, had a value conservatively estimated at £4.0 billion. Among the officially suppressed data (withheld because it was supplied by a security ag ency) was a table provided by the National Criminal Intelligence Servi ce showing average UK street prices for various drugs. The average cost tor a heavy cannabis (marihuana) user was given as £89 a week, and £525 for a user of crack cocaine. Users of cocaine were said to be spending £420 a week, and heroin addicts £300 weekly: see Figure 30, on page 170. The suppressed pages, according to 'The Guardian', stated that the drugs supply market into Britain is sophisticated, and that attempts to intervene had not resulted (as of June 2003) in sustainable disruption to the mark et at any level. 'Government interventions against the drug business are a cost of doing bus iness, rather than a substantive threat to the industry's viability.... B ecause upstream UK suppliers enjoy high profits, they are more able to absorb the cost of interception. Thus upstream seizures may temporarily impact street availability, but are unlikely to threat en the viability of any individual business'. Stressing the hopeless inadequacy of seizure rates, the study said that the outcome over the preceding decade and a half had been that, 'despite interventions at every point in the supply chain, cocaine and heroin consumption has been rising, prices [have been] falling, and drugs have continued to reach users'. Since 'The Guardian' had access to the page s of the first Birt Report which were withheld under the Freedom of Information Act, and since the newspaper's coverage made no mention of the involvement of inte lligence services, it may be assumed that it was made clear to the newspaper that such refe rences would not be welcome. But they are necessary. And now that intelligence confirmation of this scandal has been forthcoming it will be interesting to see whether the filthy activities of GO-2/MI6 are brought to a halt through an overdue change of personnel, or whether, as usually happens, the buck will be passed, the messenger will be shot, and the crisis will simply escalate. Lord Birf s report subsided, unfortunately, into the usual mushy rhetoric about the number of deaths in Britain from drugs (749 annually from heroin and methadone) being nothing like the 6,000 annual deaths from al cohol abuse and the 100,000 deaths inflicted by smoking tobacco. There were 674 annual hospital admissions on mental health grounds resulting from cannabis use, compared with an average of 3,480 in the case of heroin users (on the basis of the outdated data contained in the report). But three million people in Britain (5% of the population) use illicit drugs every year. Figure 28 shows the e xponential notified increase in UK dependent opiat e and cocaine users between 1970 and 2 000 inclusive. It reveals that prior to the collapse of morality and the international competitive drug- running free-for-all presided over and facilitated by intelligence communities, there were hardly any dependent opiate and cocaine users in the United Kingdom at all.

The 'Live 8' 'concert' of trashy 'music' held in Hyde Park at which Sir Bob Geldof was hugged in public by Tony Blair in a revolting display of touc hy-feeliness, was another such deliberately demoralising artificial event, which the Br itish media blew up out of all proportion.

THE PRESCRIPTION OF THE GERM AN AGENT, LAVRENTII BERIA It has already been stated that Lavrentii Beria, Stalin's odious Interior Ministry secret police chief, was a deep-cover German agent. This fact is well understood among UK 'THE COMMUNIST MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS ON PSYCHO- POLITICAL WARFARE' With a n Introduction by Lavrentii Beria From Volume 9, Congressional Record, 1939 'This misalignment of the loyalty of youth... sets the proper stage for a realignment of their loyalties with Communism. Creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbehaviour and uncontrolled freedom... will with ease bring about our alignment'. • Note that Beria understood that demand for drugs has to be created (through supply), since of course, no natu- ral demand for such poisonous substances exists - a simple reality that UK and US authorities choose to ignore. • Beria prescribed that Psychopolitical operatives masquerading as 'mental healers' must be placed in the close entourage of the children of prominent leaders. This method represents a manifestation of the llluminati's rule, based upon Jesuitical practice, of positioning their agentur adjacent to seats of power, or better still, occupying powerful positions. This is why intelligence officers are Presidents, Prime Ministers, holders of high office, and top officials in leading countries. In the psychopolitical context German intelligence has successfully destabilised foreign regimes using 'mental healers' - instances being: (1) Rasputin, a German agent who operated right deep inside the Russian Royal Family; (2) Mrs Wallis Simpson, an agent for the Abwehr, who penetrated the British Royal Family with a view to influencing the King to disapprove of war against Germany. Edward VIII was allowed to claim that he had renounced the throne because of love for his 'commoner' companion, but in reality he was forced to abdicate when the Abwehr's penetration was exposed; and (3) Susie Orbach, a 'mental healer' (psychoanalyst) from the US West Coast allegedly not recognised professionally in London, who may have targeted Princess Diana. ■ Figure 31: 'Brain-Washing': A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics', or the 'Communist Manual of Instructions on Psychopolitical Warfare', as exposed by Kenneth Goff in testimony before a US Congressional Committee hearing in Washington DC [Extracted from Volume 9 of the 1939 Congressional Record]."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"174 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs intelligence operatives. So, following Stalin 's death, Beria took it upon himself to implement instructions from his covert German (Nazi) controllers, and travelled to East Germany where he had intended to start th e process which the KGB and the GRU actually implemented more than a generation later, in 1989 - at the end of the 40-year period that was secretly agreed between the Allies and Stalin during which Germany was to be occupied by all the wartime 'Allies'. While working for his occultic Illuminist meister, Beria indulged in the extirpation of human beings on a scale which would have made his German mentors, Karl Marx and Adolf Hitler, envious. The proportions of Be ria's 'population reduction' orgy of terror will, however, have been marginal compared with what may have been planned for the United States, and which would be put into effect if the Fourth Reich were to complete its elevation into view on the ruins of the Republic. This is what Nazis stated, in a document exposed in Chapter 8, that they intend to achieve; and many thinking Americans who have managed to avoid being brainwashed and psychologically manipulated by their partially criminalised intelligence services, reco gnise instinctively what could be in store. Given Lavrentii Beria's long covert service to the Nazi International at the epicentre of Stalin's murderous Illuminist regime, and given that Beria was one of the most odiously Satanic of all the Illuminati's 'Soviet' revolutionaries, it is instructive to review what this ogre had to say about the use of drugs to poison and destabilise targeted populations. His poisonous advice appeared in a textbook prepared by the Comintern for use by US underground Communist training schools. It contains an address by Lavrentii Beria to American students attending Lenin University in Moscow, prior to 1936. The text of this address was published as a Foreword to the subversive document - which was originally entitled 'T HE Communist Manual of Instructions in Ps ychopolitical Warfare', and was employed in the United States for the training of Communist political cadres in the 1930s. It was first exposed by a Mr Kenneth Go ff, who was a dues-paying member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) from 2nd May 1936 to 10th October 1939, when he resigned in disgust, in order to appear voluntarily before the Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, which was chaired at that time by Martin Dies. During the years of his US Party membership, Goff atte nded a Communist Party school located at 113 E. Wells Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, whic h functioned under the name of The Eugene Debs Labor School. The curriculum included training in psychopolitics, including 'the art of capturing a nation through brainwashing and fake mental health - the subjecting of whole nations of people to the rule of the Kremlin by the capturing of their minds' 48 . This conditioning included the use of drugs, and the sexualisation of youth, with the deliberate intent of disassociating young people from their national loyalties, and their families. It is manifest that Beria's evil prescription has been fulfilled to the letter, through the creation of Satanic 'music' and a drug-pop culture which alienates them from their families, promotes wholesale promiscuity, and procures the breakdown of the family, institutions and society that has taken place. It is also clear that Mr Goff did not unde rstand that the programme he was outlining was the agenda of the Illuminati. In the document exposing the Illuminati, dating from the late 18th century that the Author examines in Chapter 7, it will be seen that the promoters of societal breakdown knew, and know, that what they prescribe for youth is wrong and undesirable, but they justify what they pres cribe with the excuse that the outcome w ill be 'for the greater good' (of the Brotherhood): the end justifies the means."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 175 'THE COMMUNIST MANUAL ON PSYCHOPOUTICAL WARFARE' AND PARALLEL U.S. ABOMINATIONS 'The Communist Manual on Psychopolitical Warfare' was used in the United States in the 1930s for training Communist cadres. The Manual was expo sed by an American Comm unist, Kenneth Goff, who resigned from the Communist Party USA (C PUSA), in 1939, after three years as a dues-paying member, operating under his own name and an alias, John Keats. In 1939, Goff appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee chaired by Martin Dies, in Washington DC, and his testimony was published in Volume 9 of the Congressional Record of that year. Allegations that the text was a British forgery, are false. The Soviet llluminati regime defined psychopolitics as 'the art and science of asserting and maintaining dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, bureaus, and the masses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through \"mental healing'\". By 'mental healing' was meant intervention by fa ke 'psychiatrists' whose evil task, while mas- querading as that of healing, was actually to destabilise and control the minds of their targets. Particular emphasis was placed upon the targeting of the spouses and children of prominent figures in the policymaking and political firmaments of 'enemy' countries. The families of these persons', the Manual assert ed, 'are often deranged from idleness and glut, and this fact must be played upon, ev en created. The normal health and wildness of a rich man's son must be twisted and perverted and explained into neurosis and then, assisted by a timely administration of drugs or violence, turned into criminality or insanity. This brings at once someone in \"mental healing\"' (e.g., Rasputin, a German agent) 'into confidential contact with the family, and from this point on, the very most must then be made of that contact'. This prescription is identical to the splinter-programming operations of specialist US intelligence cadres working within the framework of the Himmlerian tradition and such mind-control programmes, designed to split targeted persona lities, as MK-ULTRA Project Monarch, under which Multiple Personality Disorder was created and subdivided so that the victim acquires a wide range of 'alters' which his or her handler can trigger using pre-programmed words or phrases from 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Alice in Wonderland', and many other freakish mind-fantasies. The fact that Lavrentii Beria, who has been exposed as a German agent, like Rasputin, was promoting the same Satanic des tructive degradation prescriptions as the heirs of Nazi psychological warfare operatives, provides irrefu table confirmation of the common llluminati origins of the two primary 20th Century 'Black' regimes, Soviet Communism and Nazism. In the United States, official researchers in this field established how to exploit the Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), or Dissociative Ident ity Disorder (DID) created by means of near- death trauma (violence) and gross sexual abuse in their vict ims. DID represents the mind's sane response to insanity - providing a mechanism for dealing with trauma that is beyond comprehension. For instance, incestuous rape (e xtensively used for this purpose, as parent s in this business ritually abuse their children) violates primitive instinct and surpasses pain tolerance. By compartmentalising the memory of such horrendous abuse, the rest of the mind can function 'normally' as though nothing had happened - until reminded of the past abuse. This compartmentalisation, Himmler's researchers and their Satanic US and German CIA heirs discovered, is created by the brain actually shutting down neuron pathways to a specific part of the brain. The same part of the brain that is already conditioned to the trauma then deals with it again and again, as 'needed'. Lavrentii Beria, being an agent for the Abwehr who reached the position of head of the Soviet NKVD, was talking 'the same language'. The 'Manual', to which he provided an introduction, taught, for instance, that 'exercises in sexual attack on patients should be practiced by the psychopolitical operative to demonstrate the inability of the patient under pain-drug hypnosis to recall the attack, while indoctrinating a lust for further sexual activity on the part of the patient'. For this purpose, unsuspecting patients were to be satiated and hooked with opiates, cocaine, and other mind-bending drugs. ■"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"176 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs We can see this much more clearly today, given the intensive research that has been taking place into these issues, and the brazen lack of concern shown by promulgators of the 'New Age' abominations, about such exposures as have already occurred. Of special interest here is the Communist Manual's instructions concerning the distribution of drugs: 'By making available drugs of various ki nds, by giving the teenager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulating him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol 49 , the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness into which can then be cast the solution which will give the teenager complete freedom everywhere - Communism'. In case it should be imagined that the prescribed outcome (Fasco-Communism) is outmoded, any brief study of the logical conclusion of what is happening and intended in both Europe and the United States will confir m that the projected end-product is 'Fascist Communism'. And if it should be thought that , as a covert Nazi, Lavrentii Beria would not have wanted to promote Communism, a moment's recollection of the Stalin-Hitler dialectic ('International' Socialism versus 'National' Socialism) will bring the observer back 'on message'. Recall, too, that the regimes of Lenin/Trotsky and Stalin, on the one hand, and of Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels et al on the other, were the first mega-Illuminati Black regimes, created as models for the future , and based on the false dialectical 'opposites' developed by the 'two Karls', Ritter (Fascism) and Marx (Communism) [see page 558] whose work was sponsored by the Illuminati. Becaus e the Illuminati, and their Nazi associates have never been defeated - the destruction of the Hitler regime having been mistaken for the destruction of Nazism - these demonic forces, driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer', have never rested, and intend to implement their hellish plans. As the Nazi paper examined in Chapter 8 explained, 'for us, the war never ended'. The psychopolitical operator (a false psychiatrist or psychoanalyst, such as those spawned especially in the United States follo wing the mass migration of revolutionary actives like Wilhelm Reich, from Freud's Vienna-based school) was in a position, the 'Communist Manual' advised, to turn children into beasts: 'The role of the psychopolitical operator in this is very strong. He can, from his pos ition as an authority on the mind, advise all manner of destructive measures. He can teach the lack of control of this child at home' ('do as you please' education). 'He can instruct, in an optimum situation, the entire nation in how to handle children -and instruct them, so that the children, given no control, given no real home, can run wildly about with no responsibility for their nation or for themselves'. This agenda [see also Chapter 2] has long si nce been implemented in both Britain and the United States - taking the dark form of 'Outcome-Based Education' in which the child's attitudes and acceptance of 'univers al values' are rated far above his or her acquisition of knowledge and skills. It is hard ly surprising that in neither country can sizeable numbers of graduates spell or compose sentences properly, and that in the United States, attention span s can now be measured in nanoseconds. This is obvious whenever one is unfortunate enough to glan ce at almost any US TV programme: sub- liminal messages and rapidly changing images are intentionally consistent with the minimisation of attention spans. This condition in turn maximises the potenti al for the malevolent Illuminati elite to exploit, manipulate, mislead, deceive, control, and ultimately perpetrate atrocities against, its own citizens, with 100% impunity. That people could be so consistently ill- intentioned is hard to comprehend: but we are describing reality."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 177 'TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND POWER, RULERS MUST DEPLOY TERROR' The intended mass psychopolitical offensive was delayed, beyond the Soviet Union, because of the outbreak of the Second World War. It was resumed in the 1950s, after Stalin's death, when it was integrated into the Communist long-range deception strategy later exposed by Anatoliy Golitsyn in his classic works 'New Lies for Old' and 'The Perestroika Deception' 50 . With our closer understanding of the German origins of these evils, the precise correlation of Lavrentii Beria's drug-based prescription for the creation of societal 'chaos out of order', and the parallel prescriptions of the Frankfurt School [see Addendum, Chapter 4], become glaringly self-evident. The 'Communist Manual' further prescribed the psychomanipulative ingredients necessary for any sustained reign of 'state terror', the relevance of which can be seen much more clearly in the light of contemporary random global terrorism attacks such as the DVD/Al -Qaeda 9/11 atrocities, Madrid or the DVD- coordinated terrorist attacks in London on 7th July 2005. For instance, the 'Communist Manual' proclaimed that: 'An element of terror must always be present on the part of those who would govern'. Were George Bush Sr. and Jr., Vice- President Cheney and their cohorts ever students of the 'Communist Manual on Psychopolitical Warfare'? Their obvious understanding of the role that terror is meant to play, according to the Illuminati, in the retention and maximisation of power, appears to be a practical consequence of their comparable indoctrination, programming and conditioning as controlled and controlling operatives through MK-ULTRA-type mind-focused and sex- based Monarch abominations - Mr Cheney having at one stage allegedly been in charge of the MK-ULTRA and related Himrnlerian-Tavi stock conditioning programmes developed by the CIA. The pedigree of these Satanic mind- and personality-modification methods stretches back to the Nazi scientists [Chapter 8] and earlier. Lavrentii Beria's odious prescriptions must seem primitive by the standards of the diabolical perpetrators of Himmlerian Psychological Operations and the mind- and personality-modification techniques that the CIA, the Tavistock Institute and other centres of these evil traditions in the West, and these 'inventors of evil things', have since contrived to develop. But 'qualitatively', there is no differe nce whatsoever between the cold prescriptions and institutionalised brutality taught by Beria, Himmler and Cheney. THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS • MAN IS AN EXPENDABLE ANIMAL The reprobate and hellish Lavrentii Beria taught that 'the (false) psyc hiatrist (by which was meant: psychopolitical operative) is aptly su ited to this role, for his brutalities... are inexplicably complex, and entirely out of view of human understanding.... If you would have obedience, you must make it clearly understood that you have no mercy. Man is an animal. He understands, in the final analysis, only those things, which a brute understands.... The end thoroughly justifies the means. The degradation of populaces is less inhuman than their destruction by atomic fission, for to an animal who lives only once, any life is sweeter than death'. As will be seen in the Chapter on the Illuminati, The end justifies the means' is the sect's primary and explicitly stated rationale - central to its conspiratorial modus operandi, and of greater fundamental importance even than 'Do as thou wilt', the professed motto of one of the Illuminati's most perniciously reprobate manifestations, Ordo Templi Orientis, to which George Bush Sr. allegedly belongs. Lavrentii Beria, the German (Nazi) agent operating at the epicentre of Stalin's dic- tatorship, who endorsed these utterly depraved, authoritarian 'principles', which includ-"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"178 C HAPTER 3: The Lure of Drugs ed the ruthless maximisation of the potential of drug-trafficking operations as a weapon against targeted populations, met an appropriately ghas tly end, crawling on his knees and begging for the mercy that he had systematically denied to millions of his victims. According to one description of Beria's last moments, the Soviet KGB 'defector' Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko 'made an interesting revelati on that, if true, adds a curious footnote to the story of one of history' s most diabolical villains. Nose nko claimed that he was one of the agents who arrested Lavrentii Pavlovich Be ria, the man who had been Stalin's chief executioner during the mass exterminations of th e prewar purges. As head of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), a predecessor of the KGB, Beria had presided over the most feared secret police agency of its day. Millions died at his orders. But, according to Nosenko, when given a pistol and told to shoot himself, Beria cried uncontrollably, clutching at the boots of those who tried, in vain, to convince him to do \"the honourable thing\". Beria was finally shot dead by one of his captors', who is believed by some to have been Nosenko himself. As elaborated in the preceding Chapter, the mentally deranged perpetrators of Works of Darkness, whether actual members of the huge sect of the Illuminati, or their duped operatives, agentur, adepts and im plemented, have only one product: death. Which is of course why drug-trafficking, which leads addicts to an early grave, is their preferred means of financing the completion of their World Revolution, a.k.a. the New Underworld Order. Pending their early demise, drug addicts (whose fragile lives have been destroyed by these Dark Actors, the odious intelligence operatives who have prostituted themselves and their countries' integrity fo r the cash-flows 'needed ' to finance covert control operations without the sanction of the legislatures that are supposed to oversee their activities) are left to attack old ladies a nd to rob passers-by, in their desperate search for funds with which to finance the addictions induced by the s upply of drugs from which the Illuminati finance their global hegemony abominations. As for these deaths, they represent, for the co rrupt perpetrators, 'collateral damage'. The end justifies the means. Human life is expendabl e. Man is an animal. This doctrine is the Luciferian reverse of the Way, the Truth and the Life. Our consolation is that, as Paul tells us, 'they which commit such things are worthy of death' [Romans, 1, 32]. Verne Lyon, a 'former' CIA undercover operative, who appears to have realised that the slogan at Langley is a lie, and has und erstood where all this is leading, states: 'Given the power granted to the office of the Presidency and the unaccountability of the intelligence agencies, widespread illegal dome stic operations [by the CIA] are certain. We as a people should remember history, and not repeat it. It is therefore essential that the CIA be reorganized and stripped of its covert operations capability. Effective Congressional oversight is also an important condition for ending the misuse of the intelligence apparatus that has plagued every US Administration since the formation of the CIA. A great deal is at risk: our personal freedoms, as well as the viability of this society. The CIA must be put in its place.' 'Should we demand or allow anything less, we will remain vulnerable to these abuses and will face the risk of decaying into a la wless state destined to self-destruction'. This prophecy was uttered many years ago. It s accuracy cannot be disputed. It is late in the day, indeed, for honourable Americans and Britons to begin a belated agitation for the drug crimes committed against humanity by their intelligence barons to cease, and for those powerful figures who mastermind these abominations to be brought to justice. Given the depravity of their crimes, lamp-post treatment would hardly be out of order. ■"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 179 Chapter 3: THE LURE OF DRUGS: Notes and references: 1.

'The mystery of iniquity' is mentioned and explained by the Apostle Paul in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, Chapter 2, verse 7: 'For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked [One] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness'. This is a perfect descrip tion of those who invoke the pretext of 'peace' and protecting people from terrorist attacks, as justification for perpetrating atrocities. By his brilliant phrase 'the mystery of iniquity', Paul also means that the ratio nal, normal person trying to lead his life in accordance with civilised standards of morality cannot understand what drives these evil people: it is a mystery. This mystery is really only explainable in spiritual terms, namely t hat they are 'possessed': driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer'. 5.

In 'The Party's Gold', by Igor Bunich, Kiev, circ a 1986, the author recalls how Stalin ordered his NKVD (Interior Ministry) chief, Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda, to demand full details of all the co-revolutionaries' secret Swiss bank accounts and their numbers. Yagoda duly procured this information and furnished it to Stalin (Djugashvili), but omitted details of his own Swiss bank accounts. Stalin, however, who had his own 'inner inner' super-secret intelligenc e service, checked the bank account num bers off against the list supplied by his own agents, and found Yagoda's secret bank account details, which had been omitted from the list that Yagoda had himself prepared. Stalin now demanded that all those on the list repatriate the 'assets of the Party-State' which they had raped ('the Party's Gold'), which all did, hoping that by repatriating the assets they had stolen, their lives would at least be saved. But when the time came, Yagoda received a bullet through the temples, like all of the other prominent Leninist revo lutionaries with the single ex ception of Krupskaya, Lenin's widow, who broke down and wept in Stalin's presence. Stalin relented and preserved Krupskaya's life. GRU- President Vladimir Putin's campaign against the 'first generation' of (KGB-GRU) 'o ligarchs' (who are today being succeeded by an even more flamboyant group of su ch operatives) is modelled upon Stalin's operation to recover 'the Party's Gold', i.e. the assets of the Party-State which were 'privatised', for international public consumption and cosmetic hoodwinking purposes, into the hands of the selected KGB and GRU operatives who later became known as 'the oligarchs'. 12.

For human sacrificial victims, if animals are not used, the perpetrators of these atrociti es - towards which official blind eyes are routinely turned, not l east because of the involvement of elements of the official structures and law enforcement in such activities - steal babies from hospitals, or else use dr ugged female s. In March 2005, it was reported in the 'mainstream' media that the FBI has a list of 22,000 women in the United States who have been reported missing, and that none of the women on this list are ever found. Women victims are typically scouted for at all-night orgy-rave parties, during which they are drugged, and from which they never return. Indeed some such parties are staged for this very purpose. Commentaries all ege that the actual number of females who have disappeared in the United States is far larger, by an order of magnitude. The same kind of thing takes place in the United Kingdom, whence so many of these evils originate. For instance, an ordai ned churchman, known to the Editor, told us several years ago that th e number of cases of human sacrifice which he himself knew about in a given recent year, in the diocese of Exeter alone, was 19. Multiplied by the number of Church of England dioceses, this would imply several hundred abominations of actual female human sacrifice in England and Wales alone, every year. If reported at all, such intelli gence tends to be based upon anonymously supplied information, or upon leads collected by concerned priests. The same source further informed us that the actual data about these 19 human sacrifice instances were expunged from a report which is evidently compiled from time to time by the Church, and routinely 'buried'. 16.

At these Conferences by the collective efforts of the fraternal Parties, the objective laws of development of the world revolutionary process were defined, and the principles of the international strategy of the Communist movement in a new situation elaborated'. 26.

There are very few references in the Communist and Reichian literature to the Sexpol, which was a department of the Lenin School in which 'sexual politics' was taught. The 'methodology' for the exploitation of sexuality for revolutionary purposes was developed main ly by Wilhelm Reich, a leading 'light' of the revolutionary Frankfurt School based at the University of Frankfurt during the Weimar Republic period. Reich invented the phrase 'sexual revolution'. In 1934, W ilhelm Reich was expelled from the German Communist Party, from the International Psychoanalytic Organization [sic], and finally from Germany itself by the Nazis. A Freudian 'clone', Reich was a member of the Aust rian Communist Party from 1927 to 1930 (in Vienna) and of the German Communist Party from 1930 to 1934, dur ing which periods he organised sex clinics to help Austrian and German youth. The late Dr Leo Raditsa, a friend of the Author, of St John's College, Annapolis, MD, wrote, in an unpublished manuscript sent to the Author in 1999, that 'the sexual revolution of the sixties and seventies when Reich was read everywhere without, however, much public discussion, could not have occurred without Reich and, of course, his teacher, Freud'. 50.

Gorbachev (real name Orbach or Korbach) remained head of the KGB Continuum until at least 2005, when his overall supervisory responsibilities may (although the Author personally doubts this) have been taken over by Yevgeniy Primakov (Finkelstein), leaving Gorbachev free to continue escorting a wealthy US West Coast divorcee and gathering intelligence on the US social circuit. The Perestroika Deception, Golitsyn's second classic work, was first published in 1995, and was edited by this Author. It has been reprinted four times and is available from Edward Harle Limited at t he London and Ne w York offices [www.edwardharle.c om]. This second work contained a large number of predictions about the future course of events, based upon Golitsyn's self-initiated memoranda to the Central Intelligence Agency, which approved publication after screening for security issues. The Soviet Leninist long-range deception strategy is described in both volumes. Additi onal documented intelligence about the long-range deception strategy is contained in the Author's book 'The European Union Collective', Edward Harle Limited. London and New York, 2002: see again www.edwar dharle.com. The details of the Soviet strategic deception component are not elaborated here, as this would take us away from the focus of the present work. The three mentioned titles provide comprehensive information about Soviet strategic deception and how it has been deployed to hoodwink the West - as a key element of the llluminati's dialectical manipulation process. ■ • • • Note on Putin: That Vladimir Putin is a senior Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) operative is not in doubt, even thou gh very senior CIA officials who were so informed by a contact of the Author's during a 'spy cruise' off the West Coast of the United States, were surprised and alarmed to be advised of this crucial fact, assuming him to be a KGB officer. That Putin is G RU is evident not least from his general demeanour, especially from his fixation with the martial arts. One respected senior hands-on US intelligence officer, who used to go drinking with Putin in Leningrad, and who was interviewed in May 2004, told the Author: 'Of course he's GRU. We always knew he was dangerous because of his preoccupation with judo etc'. 'Mike' Delmart Vreeland, an Office of Naval intelligence operative with hands-on experienc e in Moscow, separately confirmed that Putin is a GRU officer. Michael Waller, the US expert and historian of the KGB, has reported that a biography of Putin, viewed on the Internet in 1997, alluded to Putin's GRU background, but that this information was edited out of subsequent versions of his biographical details (after he had risen to international prominence). Finally, it is evident from the quite extraordinary hagiography of Putin, 'First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait of Vladimir Putin', ghost- ed by Nataliya Gevorkyan, Natalya Timakova and Andrei Kolesnikov, Public Affairs, Perseus Books Group, New York, 2000, that Putin has a background with Soviet military Intelligence. Putin masterminded the successive satellite 'revolutions' from East Germany, working in collaboration with US intelligence cadres. ■ THE MASONIC CHINESE TRIAD DRUG CADRES Shamefully, the world's leading countries compete among themselves for advantage in the world's most valuable business - drugs. The Chinese drug-running community is dominated by the criminal offshoots of the Chinese Triad Society, a once colossal 'patriotic' organisation fo rmed to rid China of its hated Manchu overlords, the Ch'ing dynasty. The original Triad Society has continued to flourish in Hong Kong and in every sizeable Chinese community overseas - which means just about everywhere. Most of its members are hardworking, law-abiding citizens. But in the early 1980s, the criminal minority among them was known to be organised into more than 1,500 gangs, with over 500 based in Kong Kong alone, engaged in narcotics, prostitution rackets, illegal gambling, protection rackets, and murder-on-demand. The Chinese have a long tradition of secret societies, with the first thought to have been formed 2,000 years ago. The resulting instincts for secrecy have given Chinese intelligence a considerable advantage over its foreign rivals, while also ensuring that Chinese criminal or ganisations have earned a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency that makes Mazzini's Ma fia and its heirs look amateurish. Writing in the best book on this subject, 'Triangle of Death: The Inside Story of the Triad's-the Chinese Mafia' [Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, ISBN 0-7100-8732-2, date uncertain] the Australian-born researcher, Frank Robertson, stated: 'Today there is no valid comparison between the Triad Society and the Mafia, and even less with Western Freemasonry, although there is a similarity in some of the recognition signals used by the Chinese Society and Masons'. The author distinguishes between the original nationalistic organisation and its non- criminal continuum, which he calls the Triad Society, or 'The Society', and the Chinese criminal gangs, which he calls 'the Triads'. Photographs of the hand-signals used by the Triads show that they are all left-handed, involving elaborate contortions of the left hand to generate signals with exotic titles such as 'H ead of Dragon' and 'Tail of Phoenix' (the sign of a branch commander). There is also a photograph of 'the secret Triad hand- clasp used by the Second Lodge in Hong Kong', showing that the Triad initiating the greeting uses his left hand to clasp his colleague's right hand in a completely unnatural manner. The author's di smissal of Masonic influence or connections is obviously inaccurate, since the facts that Triads operate in Lodges, and use initiation ceremonies and secret handshakes, make it clear that this organisation, like its lethal J apanese criminal counterpart, the Yakuza, is a huge Masonic op. ■"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 183 CHAPTER FOUR THE HEX OF HIMMLER THE PSY-OPS DEVIL IN THE RITUAL FIRE SACRIFICE Among the spectators, including a group of Israelis, who were conveniently situated in Brooklyn directly across the river from the World Trade Center as the two passenger aircraft hit the Twin Towers on 9th September 2001, was a 'photographer' named Mark Phillips. Within days of the atrocities, photographic sti lls of the smoke and the flames engulfing the towers were released into th e public domain. The Author became aware of the existence of the two images, shown here in Figure 3, page 11, and Figure 32 below, which purport to reveal the face of the Devil in the smoke and flames.

The Author established that the images were timed at 8.59 am on 11th September 2001, and were submitted electronically to AP's bureau at 9.13 am. In separate investigations, the Author and colleagues have established that all enquiries to Associated Press concerning 9/11 have had to be routed through the Washington Bureau, which indicates very clearly that information on these events is controlled by US intelligence, of which Associate Press is essentially an extension and which it is is known to serve generally. Initially, it seemed to the Author to be im possible for such an image to be inserted within the brief timeframe of 14 minutes implied by the timings given by the AP Librarian in London, which are marked on the source of the stills. The Author was initially therefore inclined to accept the terrifying pictures as genuine. Concerning the CNN photograph [Figure 3, page 11], which shows another face of the Devil in the flames, the Author has not been able to establish the relevant time-sequence. According to David Bay, of the independent US Baptist Cutting Edge Ministries, two former Satanists called him within two hours af ter these pictures were released, to inform him that the demons, especially the image in Figure 32, looked exactly like demons they had seen during an occult ritual in which demons physically manifest themselves in this dimension (after being 'conjured'). Some of the most powerful demons in Satan's kingdom are known as Fire Demons, as implied by the Author's late friend Malachi Martin who confirmed, as reported on page 7, that Illuminati and 'high' geomasonic initiates 'have all passed through [initiation] that involves three things: the infliction of pain without flinching, the infliction of death without flinching, and the use of fire'. It was to Fire Demons that the ancient pagan peoples, including at times the children of Israel, sacrificed their children to Moloch (post- natal contraception), which 'illuminates' the evil represented by the idol Moloch in the shap e of a giant owl that is at th e centre of bizarre occult ritual ceremonies at the Bohemian Grove [see box, page 161], frequented by the Illuminati, including [see the same box] the German Illuminist, Helmut Schmidt. (All German Chancellors are selected by the DVD, Dachau). The appearance of these demons can legitimately be interpreted as confirmation that the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers - which were blown up from deep underground (in accordance with the final paragraph of Protocol 9 of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion', which is the Illuminati blueprint for the New World Order (Kingdom of Satan)), skewed so that the blame for Dluminati atrocities is transferred to the Jews (see Chapter 7) - was a fire ritual sacrifice carried out by the Illuminati - the New Orleans catastrophe being by contrast, a water or drowning sacrifice. (The Holocaust was an earlier mass sacrifice abomination). In 1990, Steve Jackson, a creator of card games, began developing a card game that he later called the 'Illuminati New World Order' (PNWO) game. The British intelligence-linked Psy-Ops so-called 'White Magic' occultist David Icke, has drawn attention to the most striking of the cards in this game, which include a card showing a terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The card game was eventually published in 1995. But right at the start of the process of developing the game, Jackson r eceived an unwelcome visit. He stated [on www.sjgames.com] that 'on the morning of March 1, 1990, without warning a force of armed Secret Service agents - accompanied by Austin police and at least one civilian 'expert' from the phone company - occupied the offices of Steve Jackson Games and began to search for computer equipment.... A large amount of equipment was seized, including four computers, two laser printers, some loose hard disks, and a great"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 185 deal of assorted hardware', including the computer containing the blueprints of the new game. Steve Jackson later won the subsequent court case. In those days, the Secret Service was ultim ately controlled by George Bush Sr., and Jackson and Icke have speculated that Presid ent George Bush Sr. may have been worried about something that S.J. Games was up to, and organised the raid in an attempt to shut the firm down so that the card game - which anticipated an event th at was then still 11 years into the future - would never appear. In the event, the game was produced and won the 1995 Origins Award for Best Card Game. CIA PSY-OPS DABBLING INEVITABLY CONJURES UP DEMONS Mark Phillips openly advertises himself on the Internet as a 'former' CIA operative. There is of course no such thing as a 'former' intelligence officer. And this man is much more than a routine cloak-and-dagger man. He is a prof essional handler, with a special expertise: psychological operations - a nefarious discipline, derived from the experimental activities of Heinrich Himmler and his cadre of evil Nazi scientists: activities that Western intelligence agencies, notably the British and the American communities, have elaborated, as of course have the covert Soviets. Phillips is the co-author of a controvers ial and extremely unpleasant Psychological Operations (Psy-Ops) book called Trance Formation of America: The True Story of a CIA mind- control Slave [1995] with Cathy OBrien, the so-called MONARCH slave in question [see box, page 161, page 224 et seq., and Figure 42, page 225]. Mark Phillips deprogrammed her 1 . Photographs of Phillips reveal him to resemble the epitome of a CIA or DIA officer - large forehead, white, typically stressed-looking and not at all a happy man. This reflects the fact that he is an expert in mind- and personality-programming, and segmentation, behaviour modification, deprogramming, manipulation and 'psychic driving' - with experience in mind-control and MK-ULTRA-type trauma-based mind-bending. Phillips is or has been involved in top secret US Government investigations into 'secret knowledge' (dabbling in the occultic 'Ancient Mysteries') which may include activities akin to sorcery, wizardry, divination, demonology psychological manipulation, personality-splitting through sexual abuse, and related nefarious activities 'pioneered' under Heinrich Himmler and annexed by the Soviet Union and the West following the Second World War, which the Western Allies foolishly concluded had erased Nazism from history (a fatal, millennial error). Secret knowledge equals power, the intended end result being (global) control - which is what the New Underworld Order perpetrators are seeking. This is of course the most demonic form of idolatry. Remember what Satan said to the Lord when he was tempting Him? [page 23]: 'Again, the Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou w ilt fall down and worship me'. ALL 'kingdoms' are in Satan's hands. What these geomasonic New Underworld Order fanatics, members of the congregation of the Synagogue of Satan (the Illuminati), have done, is the precise opposite of what the Lord did: they have fallen down before Satan to worship him. But Satan, being 'the father of lies and a murderer from the beginning' and 'the author of confusion', is of course playing deadly games with them, which is what his demons invariably do when invoked. All conjuration runs the extreme risk that those doing the invocations will certainly be deceived. Satan is not a reliable partner, and cannot easily be shaken off once a person has entered into an agreement with him or his minions."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"186 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF TH E BRITISH TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE Yet the Illuminated Ones continue to believe that what they call The Project - to procure global control at all costs, eliminatin g billions of human beings in the process if 'necessary' - is feasible, and even 'on track' to succeed, not withstanding that the current generation of Illuminati intelligence patriarchs are becoming exceedingly long in the tooth, having missed several 'completion deadlines', many being long past normal retirement age: another typical trick of Satan. Here they are, turning the whole world upside down in pursuit of their Luciferian objectives, having fallen down and worshipped Satan, who they imagine has given them 'permission' to proceed - but who, in reality, is tricking, deceiving and impeding them, complicating and generally making their life as close to a living hell on earth, as it will most certainly be fo r them when they d escend into the pit. A primary source of demonic mind-control research for the past three-quarters of a century and more has been the Tavistock Ins titute, established by the British Military Intelligence officer Sir John Rawlings-Reese in 1921, initially to study the effects of shell-shock on British troops who survived the First World War, and soon to establish the 'breaking poinf suffered by men under extreme stress . His successor in 1932 was Kurt Lewin, a German Jewish operative who soon transferred from Britain to the United States in the 1930s, the first of many prew ar German intelligence infiltrat ors, and set up the Harvard Psychology Clinic [see box op posite, page 187]; and during this period, the Tavistock Institute supposedly focused on strategic warfare studies. The Institute was established under the direction of the secret Britis h Psychological Warfare Bureau. An offs hoot of this notorious Institute, the National Institute for Applied Behavioural Studies, organises so- called 'sensitivity training' for corporate leaders and government groups and organisations. The influence of the Tavistock Institute as a source of knowledge on behaviour modification in Britain, the United States and Commonwealth countries, especially Australia, Canada and New Zealand, should not be underestimat ed. Its prophet was the Austrian-German of Jewish extraction, Sigmund Freud, and it pioneered behavioural science along Freudian lines. Its 'network' includes the far-left, often subversive University of Sussex; the Stanford Research Institute; the Esalen Institute at Big Sur, CA, dir ected in the 1980s by Dr Jim Garrison, who established the Tamalpais Institute on 10th April 1991 which became the Gorbachev Foundation/USA on 10th April 1992; the Hudson Institute (specialising in futurology); the Heritage Foundation; the Geor getown University Center for Strategic and International Studies (where US State Depart ment personnel are trained); US Air Force Intelligence; and the RAND (= R esearch ANd Development) Corporation; plus the CIA's crucially important Mitre Corporation [MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology] which is engaged inter alia in procuring that every computer in the world will report directly into the Pentagon. Other prominent Tavistock-related mind-bending operations include the Human Ecology Fund (part of the MK-ULTRA infrastructure supporting illegal experiments on mind-control), the Ditchley Foundation, created in 1957 (which has an American branch), and is used as an important conduit for secret Tavistock instructions, the Brookings Institution, Flow Laboratories, National Tr aining Laboratories (NTL), the Institute for Applied Behavioural Sciences, National Education Association, the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (at the University of Pennsylvania), and the Institute For The Future which, though funded by the Ford Fo undation, draws its long-range forecasting from the Tavistock Institute. This institute's projects define what it believes to be the changes that will be taking place within 50-year time-frames: its so-called 'Delphi pan-"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 187 KURT LEWIN: GERMAN TAVISTOCK OPERATIVE The Tavistock Institute 'of Human Relations' [sic ] operates from long-established offices at 30 Tabernacle Street, London EC2A 4DD, on the fringes of the City of London. It distributes Human Relations, published by Plenum Press, and a new journal calling itself Evaluation. Having been set up originally by Sir John Rawlings-Reese to study the effects of shellshock on British troops, it appears to have been targeted almost from the out set by elements of the German llluminati - Sigmund Freud being its original 'prophet' (who settled in Maresfield Gardens, London, when he moved to Britain). In 1932, the German 'refugee' of Jewish extrac tion, Kurt Lewin, managed to penetrate the Institute, of which he quickly became a Director. In the following year, Lewin surfaced in the United States, still calling himself a 'refugee'. He was the driving force behind the establishment of the Freudian Harvard Psychology Clinic. It s hould not be assumed that because this entity originated much of the propaganda campaign to turn the US public against Germany, in preparation for the United States' entry into the Second World War, Lewin, being of Jewish extraction, was fundamentally anti-German. On th e contrary, as is the standard practice of deep penetration operatives, he aligned himself with the Zeitgeist of the day, while at the same time performing the subversive tasks for which he had been selected. Dr Henry Kissinger, who experienced a meteoric rise to power later, another of these German refugees of Jewish extraction, was a student of Sir John Rawlings-Reese. In 1938, President Roosevelt executed a secret agreement with the Britis h authorities, under the terms of which the Special O perations Executive was instructed to formulate US policies. In implementation of this agreement, Roosevel t despatched General Donovan to London for indoctrination (partly at the Tavistock Institute), preparatory to setting up OSS, which became the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, under the su pervision of SOE-SIS. OSS methods, extended to and massively elaborated by the CIA, have always been driven by guidelines originally established by the Tavistock Institute which, as we have seen, was penetrated by German operatives and modelled its operations along mechanistic lines which deny humanity and treat human beings like mindless animals. The Institute's title implie s that its main focus is the fostering of harmonious 'human relations', whereas its real purpose is the developmen t of methodologies to control human behaviour - the identical llluminati remit to that followed by Heinrich Himmler. The Tavistock Institute 'of Human Relations' originated the mass civilian bombing raids conducted by Roosevelt and Churchill as clinical ex periments in the monitori ng of mass terror. All Tavistock and its related American foundations have a single objective -to break down the psychological strength of the individual, by means of such devices, borrowed inter alia from the Frankfurt School and mimicking the programme of Lavrentii Beria, as mass brainwashing ('political correctness') and the fostering of a mental attitude of sullen, grim resignation in the face of the advancing New Underworld Order of the llluminati. Any technique that helps to break down the family unit, and family-inculcated pr inciples of revealed religion (only available through True Christianity), honour, reliability, respect for the female sex, patriotism and sexual behaviour, is deployed by Tavistock 'school' scientific manipulators as weapons for manipulating 'the masses'. With the de facto partial ascendancy of the lllumi nati, mass invocations of occult forces are also increasingly in evidence - recent examples being the mass sacrifice of British farm animals (animal sacrifices) in the late 1990s, and new controlled 'nat ural' catastrophes (with occultic connotations) invoking the forces of air, fire, earth and water. Freudian psychotherapy, malevolently applied, induces permanent mental illness through the desta bilisation of the psyche and character. The victim may then be advised to 'establish new rituals of personal interaction' - meaning to indulge in brief sexual encounters which in fact set the participants adrift with no stable personal relationships, thus destroying their ability to establish or maintain a family. In the United States, the Tavistock School' has developed such power that no-one achieves prominence in any field unless he or she has been trained in scxalled 'behavioural sciences' at Tavistock or one of its numerous effective US subsidiaries. All the operations of the Tavistock School' are directed towards producing cyclical collapse, which explains wh y the CIA's 'Heart of Darkness' yields such poisonous fruit. ■"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"188 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler els' decide what is normal and what they consider to be abnormal, and prepare position papers to 'steer' Government. It recommends the liberalisation of abortion legislation and drugs usage, that cars entering urban areas shoul d pay tolls, teaching birth control in schools, legalising homosexuality, transferring planning permissions and zoning controls to central government, and the establishment of new communities in rural areas (a la Pol Pot, using concentration camps). Of exceptional power and importance, too, is the notorious Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), which spawns satellite ope rations like raindrops. Although ostensibly an instrument for aligning US policy with that of the overt/covert Soviet Union, it is considered also to be a Tavistock 'network' agency. Finance for the IPS was derived from the Samuel Rubin Foundation and the Stern Family Fund - Samuel Rubin having himself been a member of the Soviet Comintern. The founder of the Hudson Institute in 1961, Hermann Kahn (of German Jewish extraction and background) also founded the RAND Corporation. B. K. Eakman, writing in a study entitled Educating for the New World Order [provenance uncertain], has revealed a manual for 'change agents' developed for the US Government by the RAND Corporation, which he described as... 'a how-to manual with a 1971 US Office of Education contract number on it entitled 'Training for Change Agents', plus seven volumes of 'change agent studies' commissioned by the US Office of Education from the RAND Corporation in 1973- 74; and scores of other papers submitted by behaviorist researchers who had obtained grants from the US Office of Education for the purpose of exploring how to 'freeze' and 'unfreeze' values, to 'implement change' and to turn potentially hostile groups and committees into acquiescent, rubber-stamping bodies by means of such strategies as the goofy 'Delphi Technique'. (For strategy, read: stratagem - Ed .). The RAND Corporation's main function is brainwashing using Tavistock-type techniques, which are derived from the German Frankfurt School [see pages 254-258], the Freudian influence, and the i nput of prominent Himmlerians of German background such as Hermann Kahn. It should be understood, again, that the inevit able focus on the United States in this book is not to be construed as indicative of any bias on the Author's part: on the contrary, the United States is the victim of nefarious European intrigues, the primary sources of which have historically been Britain and Germany, although the focus of this work is the German dimension because the Illuminafi serves as a global programme and extension of the hegemony strategy of the continuing Nazi International. All three countries (and of course others, like France, Italy and Spain) are them selves victims of the machinations of the synarchy offensive - the conspiracy of secret societies and cabals owing allegiance to Lucifer and which remain hell-bent upon procuring global control, condemning 94% of the world's population to subordinate status while the remaining 6% (which this Author considers to be a generous proportion) cons olidate their control of the world's assets, especially energy and food resources. There is little doubt that the inspiration and controlling centre of this synarchy conspiracy is Germany. These evil forces and entities, to a greater or lesser extent driven by the 'seething energies' of Lucifer, have made it their busin ess to seek the means to control populations by the use of psychotropic drugs and psychological operations (Psy-Ops), and in particular to identify ways to procure the submissive obedience of subject populations in perpetuity. It would appear, however, that the authorities concerned lack conviction that they w ill ever succeed - which explains, for instance, why the British Government maintains a colossal secret arms dump at the British Army's key base at Catterick, Yorkshire. The arms which were handed in following the controversy surrounding the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 189 GEOPOLITICS - A PAN-GERMAN (NAZI) INVENTION According to the 'Encyclopedia Americana' edi tions accessible from the 1960s, geopolitics was defined as follows: 'For this university of edu cation... modem Germany - The Third Reich - is primarily responsible. The war which blocked Germany's initial drive for world dominion, and the revolution which put into power the Nazis who were to launch the second drive, gave us geopolitics. German GEOPOLITIK is the logical product of a materialistic and deterministic school of thought which, through more than two centuries, has progressively gained sway over the German mind until it reduced man to the status of a bi ochemical entity. Geopoliti cs, in its quest for an invincible brand of power politics, has taken unto itself such varied fields as economics, juris- prudence, the social sciences, medici ne, psychology and military strategy'. The accuracy of this assessment - complete with the realisation by the author that the Second World War represented a further drive for world domination, implying that the drive had by no means been abandoned - is unique for the period. The 'American Encyclopedic Dictionary', also dating from the 1960s, described geopolitics specifically as 'a doctrine of Nazi Germany, advocating aggressive expansion'. And in his address to American students attending Lenin University in the 1930s for indoctrination (incorporated as a preface to 'Brainwashing', the ve rsion of The Communist Manual of Instructions on Psychopolitical Warfare', which was used in the United States in the 1930s for the training of Communist cadres in the United States, the deep covert Ge rman Abwehr operative and long -term German penetration agent, Lavrentii Beria, who headed Stalin's repressive NKVD (Interior Ministry and a predecessor of the KGB) asserted: 'Psychopolitics is an important if less known, division of geopolitics'. So Beria presided over the implementation of the pan-German (Nan) tradition and methodology of geopolitics in the Soviet Union, which he integr ated into the curriculum for the training of Soviet and external Communist cadres. It is hard to imagine a more absolute confirmation of the fundamental identity of National Socialism (Nazism) with International Socialis m (Communism), which the llluminati manipulated dialectically then, and are continuing to manipulat e today, in furtherance of their global hegemony agenda. Lenin himself was a German Abwehr agent, who consolidated the breakthrough achieved by his fellow German agent - the psychopolitical operative, Rasputin, whose infiltration into the inner sanctum of the confused, superstitious and semi- deranged Russian Imperial Family, procured the disintegration of Tsarist power. Other German or German-tradition psychopolitical operatives who performed a similar function have included [see also page 173]: • Mrs Wallis Simpson, the sinister German Abwehr agent who, using her occult female powers, bewitched her target Edward VIII as part of an elaborate German operation which was int ended to keep the British out of the wars that the occult llluminist Adolf Hitler and his Black llluminati colleagues were planning. • Susie Orbach, a US West Coast 'psychoanalyst' practising in London, who may have been instrumental in converting her target Princess Diana from being a sweet, semi-innocent Princess into a hard-bitten and embittered divorcee, bent on revenge. The Author has been informed that German occult Black intelligence is particularly keen on this form of subversion, which involves placing a 'healer' adjacent to the targeted individual, for subversion purposes. There was no difference at all between this methodology and that promulgated by the odious Lavrentii Beria, who wrote: 'Psychopolitics is a solemn charge. With it you can erase our enemies as insects. You can cripple the efficiency of leaders by striking insanity into their families thr ough the use of drugs.... You can change their loyalties by psyc hopolitics.... By psychopolitics create chaos, leave a nation leaderless\". And the 'Manual', based on the occultic Ge rman methodology that Beria used, advocated 'creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbehaviour and uncontrolled freedom.... By making readily available drugs of various kinds, by giving the teenager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulating him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol, the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness...' needed to facilitate the attainment of hegemonic objectives.

DIMENSIONS OF THE BEHAVIOUR MODIFICATION OFFENSIVE Before following Mark Phillips' activities so mewhat further, various connections which illustrate how far infra-governmental res earch into mass and individual behaviour modification has developed since 1921, and since Himmler's expe riments using such ogres as Dr Mengele, are worth reviewing here - as governments compete among them- selves to find or perfect psychopolitical tool s to control their own and 'enemy' populations. Some of these references may seem unconnecte d, but that conclusion would be inaccurate. Subliminal mind-control research in the United States was pioneered inter alia by a Dr Milton Erickson. A 'classic' work called 'Clini cal and Experimental Hy pnosis' by Dr William S. Kroger, has been in use for many year s. The leading US scientist specialising in dissociative disorders in the 1990s was Dr Bennet Braun, of Germ an extraction. Such experts deal in activities like 'revivif ication', which is a technique for painless, non-abreactive memory recovery. A clinical technique called hynosleep has been developed which programmes a mind-controlled slave to die. Su ch slaves are used for various nefarious intelligence purposes, includin g suborning and seducing Presidents, senior officials and diplomats, or for acting as 'lone-wolf' assassins. In the United States, many 'mental health care technologies' have been held back fr om public use - for the usual reason: national security. Likewise effective therapy regimes for dissociative disorders have never been released for general application, in order to protect nefarious secrets concerning classified mind-control research. Under the National Security Act of 1947, amended in 1986 and probably subsumed by the National Intelligen ce Reform Act, which President G. W. Bush signed into law on 17th December 2004 (one-third of which, recall, is secret), the US Government can now censor or cover up anything they choose. Scientology, a demonic cult, founded by L. Ron Hubbard, who was friendly with Jack Parsons, head of the Californian chapter of th e ultra-Satanic Ordo Templi Orientis, exploits subliminal mind-control techniques acquired during Hubbard's military service with US Navy Intelligence: hence this appallingly demonic cult was a product of one of the most lethal US intelligence services, the Office of Naval intelligence (ONI). Mr Hubbard invented a fake 'science' whic h he called 'Dianeti cs', a mind-control technique which he named after his first wife Diane. At the Chicago BookExpo America event in June 2004, the Author observed a ve ry large area devoted to Scientology, and was approached by several witches who evidently thought he would be appropriate material for indoctrination. Considering that the very smallest display area, just a few feet square, costs $4,000 just for the area on which a display stand is to be erected alone, it was evident that this operation has sizeable funds at its disposal - an impression reinforced by anyone who has visited, for instance, Scientology's es tablishment at East Grinstead, Sussex. The Author has separately established that a number of well-known sects in the United States are in fact covers for money-laundering operations and are run by US intelligence officers.

All the statements in what follows are fair comment and alleged. Like many of these operations, including Moral Re-Armament (MRA) [see page 199], this organisation seems to have vast financial resources - which does not inhibit it in any way from seeking by allegedly foul means to maximise its finances (a common feature of all 'fake' religions and sects). It is in fact one of th e most heinous manifestations of the Works of Darkness spawned by UK and US intelligence, which have paralleled, competed with, and been modelled on, the manic mind and psyche experiments conducted by Himmler's scientists. A brief study of how it operates will therefore reveal the depths of depravity to which these Luciferian Illuminati 'scientists' typi cally descend, as they seek to drag innocent human beings into the pit along with their own deluded, mad operatives. Scientology is nothing less than a form of institutionalised sorcery using mental programming techniques developed in accordance with the odious traditions of the CIA's MK-ULTRA programme, and its multiple Luciferian offshoots and va riations, such as MONARCH (the programme to create high-level sex slaves who are used to convey secrets among targeted members of the global leadership elite), BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, MK-DELTA and MK-NAOMI. Large numbers of Nazi mind-control experts who had been working for Himmler were exfiltrated from Germany, mainly after the War, and were put to work inter alia (but mainly) in the United States, where they continued to elaborate the manipulative occult-oriented techniques they had developed or been working on under Himmler, in the institutes affiliated with Britain's Tavistock Institute, originally set up by the British Army Institute of Psychological Warfare. Ron Hubbard first surfaced from the Black intelligence world when he published a work called 'Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health' in 1950. He then steered straight for 'church' status, establishing the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles on 18th February 1954. Thereafter, Hubbard expounded his demented 'beliefs' and sorceries in over 40 books and 2,500 taped lectures. These da ys, the Church of Scientology claims to have more than 8 million members in 3, 200 churches in some 54 countries, with a deluded UK membership alone, of 100,000 vi ctims. However credible critics say that worldwide membership of the Church of Scientology is closer to 50,000, with British membership no higher than 1,500. In conformity with the pack of lies and fabrications on which this abomination is based, Scientology has taken very good care to substitute its own morality for Christianity. Its flavour is encapsulated in the cult's concept of 'acceptable truth', which of course begs the question: 'acceptable to whom?' Those who fall for this false 'religion' gain nothing and, as is typical with such organisations, are allegedly bled financially throughout their troubled memberships. Investigation of Scie ntology's dark activities is precluded by its 'charitable' (in the United States) status, and further by its status as a 'church'. In reality, this appears to be a typical criminal intelligence organisation, using familiar intelligence community scamming and d eception methodology, and steeped in Himmlerian mind-control and personality-manipula tion techniques.

Like the intelligence community generally, its evil activ ities are so promiscuous that it is forever engaged in cover-up operations.

Enquiries in recent years have led the Author to conclude that a subs tantial number of weird cults and sects are in reality money-laundering operations - a fact that was separately confirmed to the Author by the respected US-Israeli drug money expert, Ms. Rachel Ehrenfeld, in 1999. Certain very well known 'cults', and new elaborations thereof, which deserve extensive exposure, are just that. To mask such activities, they also preside over ruthlessly efficient scamming mechanisms for making money - like constant circulars requesting resources to fund litigation, or money to construct spectacular cathedrals or premises - and charge through the nose for all their services, indoctrination, training etc. A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE TO FOOL JUDGES AND OFFICIALS (TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO CONNECT THE DOTS) STEP 3: INTIMIDATION, LITIGATION, OPPRESSION, COERCION Those victims, members and staff who 'connect the dots' and 'discover the fact' of the fraud, are liable to be subjected to any of the nefarious assaults and oppressions shown in the diagram below.

On a number of websites, the 'secrets' of certain upper levels of this 'church' are pointedly exposed. But it is not even necessary to research such sites to be aware of the many layers of deception perpetrated on i nnocent, if ill-advised, victims. A concept (shown in wall posters) called The Bridge to Total Freedom' identifies the 'ways' to get to 'clear' and beyond, which is called Operating Thetan 8 - when one allegedly acquires the power of telekinesis and astral projection (both of wh ich are demonic activities). One ex-victim says: 'No-one would ever tell me how much it would cost [to 'get there'], but former Scientologists have claimed a figure of more than £250,000'. One of the 'church's' most controversia l processes is the familiar mind-control technique, already mentioned above, known as 'a uditing' - a process of 'eradicating one's engrams' by revisiting past traumas. The same ex-victim told \"The Times' (London, 18th February 2004): 'I was required to go over various horrible incidents for hours until my head hurt, and I felt scared and unhappy '. Scientology disseminates a portfolio of very bizarre 'facts' that are supposed to lie at the end of the 'bri dge'. A British ex-victim says: 'Had I known that at the end of the Bridge to Total Freedom we are all covered in dead space aliens as the result of the actions of an ancient galactic ru ler, Xenu (or Xanu), I would never have been interested in the first place'. Of course this is all demonic, totally fake garbage concocted by that very dead and mad US intelligence operative Ron Hubbard, who, like so many of these Illuminati nutcases, seems to have generated these demoniac fantasies while evidently possessed by demons. And indeed, this first-hand revelation tells us something vital: all references to 'space aliens' that one reads about nowadays are actually coded mentions of demons. Since modem Western man does not believe in God, he does not believe in demons either. So they go by another name. The same former UK Scientologist attended a special gala evening at Saint Hill to which no less than 7,000 people had been inv ited, two-thirds from European countries other than Britain. His description of that event contained a further clue to what Scientology is all about: 'In the oak-panell ed entrance hall there were men and women dressed in what looked like some sort of naval un iform, pressing people to join the Sea Org., a quasi-military wing of the 'church'. All around were various booths, united in their single purpose: persuading people to part with their money in pursuit of the goal of becoming a 'clear' - namely, a fully brainwashed, manipulatable, mind-controlled zombie, who, being a deluded, deceived 'Useful Idiot', has had to pay for the privilege. In the United States, an astonishing 150 Scie ntology 'churches' and corporations benefit from Internal Revenue Service Section 501(c)(3 ) full tax-exempt status (granted in 1993, after years of litigation and, in the view of so me, following alleged bribery of IRS officials, and renewed in 1999). It has been alleged that th e Internal Revenue Service (IRS) entered into a tax agreement with the Scientol ogy organisation providing tax be nefits that had previously been determined by the US Supreme Court to be unlawful. Specifically, after 20 years of opposing full tax-exempt status for Scientology, the IRS unaccountably reversed itself, and the US Federal Government now assists and participates in Scientology's expansion abroad in conformity with the sect's arrogant written policies of 'taking over the control or allegiance of key political figures... the proprietors of all news media [and] those who monitor international finance'. Now, in what context have we come across this before?

Th e ruthlessness with which drugged and programmed US military and intelligence personnel have abus ed, and continue to abuse, prisoners in Afghanistan, Iraq and many other locations, including the British island territory of Diego Garcia, and the fact that a large number of US concentration camps have been readied for use in such an eventuality, provide indications of what is to come. The mentality driving these prospect ive horrors is interchangeable with, and akin to, the twisted dementia of Scientology, which brooks no opposition, and treats all cr itics as scoundrels and enemies, to be destroyed, Its totalitarian mindset of Nazi Stalinism represents America's future. The primary governing internal law of Scientology is referred to as 'The Supreme Test', which represents what Hubbard called The ability to make things go right\" (for Scientology). Scientology deploys the Hubbardian Doctrine of 'acceptable truth' instead of the Whole Truth [see at left]. Another invention is its related 'Fair Game Law' (viz., the end justifies the means) and something called its 'Simon Bolivar Policy'. There are reports of a massive truck-driven shredding machine running for 24 hours a day for many weeks in anticipation of a raid on Scientology. Scientology identifies for its leadership positions those who consider every good tiling that happens to be attributable to the 'exact duplication' of Ron Hubbard's 'copyright' technology, and every bad thing to be due to the inadequacy or failure of the mark (language of the curt). Thousands of copyright registrations are typically filed - breaking books up into small sections. This device makes 'fair use quotation' difficult and easier to sue for. And they can't wait to sue... Pattern of blackmailing Federal Judges: Judge Richie in US vs. Mary Sue Hubbard. Use of litigation 'to harass, not to win', plus Black Propaganda and character assassination, is similar to the tactics of Third Reich. The German Government recognised this behaviour and placed Scientology under surveillance, labelling it a 'psycho-terrorist' organisation. Other countries have adopted very negative responses to this evil coercive cult Scientology has been denied religious and/or tax-exempt status in France, Bel- gium, Germany, Spain, Israel, Greece and even Russia. Given its intelligence links, this suggests that it is indeed loathed by its own evil progenitors/collaborators. SCIENTOLOGY AND ITS MYRIAD FRONTS ALL USE THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED IN THESE DIAGRAMS. THEY ARE THE FAMILIAR SCAMS OF INTELLIGENCE. One US Judge suffered attacks on his dog, and had his car tyres slashed. Scientology pursues litigation against its dissident members and staff with a clear view to obtaining a gag order for silence, to prevent its ex-members from alerting the slumbering, controlled and compromised 'mainstream' media. In certain death cases (Lisa Macpherson being one), it was falsely asserted that 'cremation' is a religious doctrine, to hide evidence. There is in fact no Hubbardian 'doctrine' about cremation. Chronic elevated levels of adrenal hormones caused by constant stress to victims results in damage to the hypothalamus in the brain. Disgruntled staff members are detained and sent to internal prison camps for reprogramming. [Professor Steven Kent: 'Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force']. Data is given to private investigators who then 'discover' it in the course of their investigations. At one point in recent years, Scientology was retaining at least three firms of private investiga- tors in Washington DC full-time, without any typ- ically odious Scientology litigation emerging. A source has suggested that this activity may have targeted US Congress or Executive Branch officials. The innermost secrets of members (victims) are collected for blackmail purposes when needed, in order to ensure silence and to gain cooperation. Physical threats: One technique is the gangland method of chasing enemies on the road and then forcing their cars into the ditch, or worse. Hubbard invented the ideological assertion that all who attack Scientology have criminal back- grounds, thereby 'justifying' relentless pressure, intimidation, coercion and harassment against all who cross its crooked, demonic path. Figure 37: Finally, the mad perpetrators of this scamming machine are compelled to devote time and resources to 'managing' those who have seen through the lies and scams, who are treated as 'traitors'. Scientology uses what it calls 'acceptable truth' rather than the concept of the whole truth, in other words, it has invented its own depraved system of 'relative morality\". This is similar to Soviet 'socialist morality and also to 'socialist legality'. Its fake' religious' stance lends this false 'credibility*. A dherents are coerced to sign secrecy and confidentiality agreements which are meant to silence them forever. This is to ensure that victims do not wake up from their dream until the Statute of Limitations for fraud has expired. O Hubbard was convicted of fraud in France.

These days, Washington seems quite content w ith Scientology's 'Fair Game' practices, which mandate the use of litigation augmented by many other overt and c overt means to 'harass', 'terrify' and/or 'utterly destroy' those whom Scientology perceives to be its enemies - which is to say, former members and staff who have seen through its endless deceptions. A detailed submission by former Scient ology victims to C ongressmen F. James Sensenbrenner and John Conyers, Chairman and Ranking Minority Member respectively of the US House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee in February 2002, contained a reference to Scientology's 'policy and practi ce of requiring certain staffers (such as Scientology's Sea Org. members) to have abortions', together with 'secular policies and practices that include child labor law viol ations and other civil and human rights violations'. The complaint to the US Congress further confirmed th e cult's 'policies and practices [that are] intended to \"utterly destroy\" those citizens and others (such as the former IRS Section 501(c)(3) Cult Awareness Network) that the religious corporation (Scientology) deems to impede its objectives'. CULTS AND SO-CALLED CULT-BUSTERS: A SELF-SERVING DIALECTIC 'Cults' like Scientology are created or exploited servants of the Illuminati, as are the dialectical opposition to them - the equally controlled 'cult-busters' (operating dialec- tically on the basis of problem-reaction-solution, or Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis). The America-based Cult Awareness Ne twork (CAN) was exposed in 1995 as a front for the Anti- Defamation League, the powerful Zionist agitprop organisation. The Zionists are essentially Jewish Nazis, incongruous though this may appear, thanks to the success of long-term Psychological Opera tions (Psy-Ops) over the decades since the Second World War - one consequence of which was that the wo rld was persuaded to equate the defeat of Nazi Germany with the destruction of Nazism and their vast apparat, which never took place. One of the prime movers behind CA N was the notorious US intelligence mind- control operative, Dr Louis Jolyn ('Jolly') West [see page 212], who was connected to a similar group called the American Family Foundation. West was the intelligence psychiatrist chosen by the authorities to 'analyse' Jack Ruby (Rubenstein), who shot Lee Harvey Oswald, the CIA operative-patsy a ccused of assassinating John F. Kennedy, and who understood that he had been set up (to mask the fact that the hit was a German Abwehr/DVD operation). Rubinstein was in turn an operative of the US-based global mafia king Meyer Lansky (born Maier Suchowjansky in Grodny, USSR), an instrument of the Rothschilds, servant of Israel, and essentially an arm of Mossad. Meyer Lansky's Chicago-based mafia organisation performed 's ervices' for US intelligence, including as has been seen, setting up drug-running operations in Asia. The fake 'church' of Scientology has a 's ecular' arm called the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises ('WISE'), an umbrella organisation controlling the organisation's myriad 'business' ventures. Businesses owned by Scientologists are licensed to use its so- called 'secular technology' (also incongruousl y referred to as 'religious technology') in exchange for license fees often exceeding 10% of gross revenues. But it is unwise to do business with WISE, for both WISE and a senior 'church' entity called RTC may enter the relevant premises, close them down and seize all 'their' assets at any time. The IRS-Scientology agreement of 1993 required WISE to be disbande d no later than 1995, but both Scientology and the IRS have ignored this provision. This s uggests that Scientology remains an alleged scamming instrument of the criminalised segment of the US intelligence community."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 199 Figures 33-37 on pages pages 191-197 reflect, as has been indicated, the findings of a former Scientology victim who opted to reveal what he had learned and experienced during half a lifetime wasted in the clutches of this evil cult. One can obtain some idea of how evil this organisation is considered to be by recalling that certain leading governments, the intelligence and secret operatio ns of which are no strangers to the occult, regard the organisation as anathema. For instance, the British authorities refused to grant Scientology tax-exempt status, on the ground that it lacks any socially redeeming qualities. It has been denied religious or tax-exempt status in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Israel, Greece and Russia. In five of these countries, it has been raided by the police. In Germany, the organisation has been desc ribed as a seditious totalitarian 'psycho- terror' group intent upon global domination, and engaged in money-laundering and financial crimes. German courts have recently upheld the official electronic surveillance of Scientology for reasons of national and internal security, and the protection of the state and its democracy. The Author has included this information not least in order to provide a context for the following observation. The ultra-secret (no longer) Black intelligence service of the Nazi International, based appropriately in Dachau, known by the initials DVD (for Deutsche Versicherungs Dienst or Deutsche Verteid-igungs Dienst, meaning either German Insurance (in the sense of insuring the future of Nazism) Service, or German Defence Service (with the same connotation) was, the Author discovered, hardly known about at all in Germany itself as late as September 2005. The Author's exposure (in International Currency Review, Volume 30, Number 4, distributed in October 2005) of this organisation's existence, and that the late Sir Edward Heath, the former British Prime Minister was a long-term Abwehr agent, may have changed this situation. DVD is basically the successor intelligence service to the Nazi Abwehr, and has served ever since as the 'Black' (hidden, wholly unaccountable) intelligence service of the continuing covert Nazi International. The DVD is not financed by German taxpayer funds, but the German Government (at Chancellor level) approves its actions. It is therefore by no means incongruous that the overt German structures should, for instance, have raised serious objections to the Satanic cult called Scient ology and all its evil baggage, not least since Germans are by no means ignorant of the ghastly activities of Heinrich Himmler and his death scientists. In the United States, Scientology's compound, located near Hemet, in California, has been labelled 'armed and dangerous'. In other words, this is quite clearly a psycho-control instrument of criminalised counterintelligence, although this reality is disguised by an 'agreement' with the US intelligence community. MORAL RE-ARMAMENT AND OTHER MIND-BENDING OPERATIONS Another long-established US mind-bending operation is Moral Re-armament (MRA), which uses the familiar technique of group exposure accompanied by implied subsequent blackmail potential. Young men selected from 'good universities' are typically brought to MRA hideaways arid premises in the United Stat es or at Caux, Switzerland, and in Mayfair, London, where, sitting in circles, they are encour aged to confess all their weaknesses and sins. Once thus stripped of the natural means of psychological protection and self-preservation, the young victims are putty in the hands of their behaviour modification manipulators and controllers. At a later stage of indoctrination, they are subjected to hard-sell pressures to hand over financial resources to the group. One long-term victim of this sect was the late British Conservative MP, Patrick Wolridge-Gordon."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"200 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler This apparat hides be hind respectable fronts, thereby deceiving the US population and the whole world. For instance, the American Psychiatric Association, an alleged instrument of the synarchical New World Or der conspiracy, disseminates disinformation about treatment modalities for severe dissociative disorders, such as what used to be called Attention Deficit Syndrome. The founder of the American Psychiatric Association, Dr Ewan Cameron, conducted MK-ULTRA mind- and pe rsonality/behavioural experiments in Canada. At meetings of various servants of Luci fer and 'The Project' to establish the Satanic New World Order, such operatives and implementers indulge in 'revelation of method' introductions, such as secret signs and hands hakes [see pages 732-737], in-group references and coded language, enabling secret society member s to identify one another, as they befuddle the contemptible masses. These 'flawed' masses were and are to be 'perfected', which was the rationale adopted by the controllers of the British Round Table, Skull and Bones operatives and their servants the Rockefellers, to justify their sponsorship and practice of research into psychiatry, eugenics and euthanasia. This particular abomination is now 'top of the agenda' in Britain, the United States and The Netherlands: hence those publicised term inations of terminally ill patients and of 'imperfecf newly-born babies. The linkages are truly horrendous: for instance, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity and it s associated institutes (which changed their co llective name after Hitl er's defeat in 1945 to Max Planck Institutes 2 ), were funded by the Rockefellers. In 1927, the Rockefeller Foundation provided f unds for the construction of the Max Planck Institute's first building. The Institute was headed by Hitler's racial purity expert, Ernst Rudin. For three decades after the war (at least), thousands of people in many European countries were sterilised. A cadre of US intelligence is engaged in the sterilisation of parts of the Mexican population to this day. A protege of Ernst Rudin, Franz J.KaIlmann, who became a key US heredity research operative in New York State, received funding from the US controllers of Sc ottish Rite Freemasonry to prove that mental illness was hereditary. Indeed, from 1949 to 1963, a certain Robert Hanna Felix was director of psychiatric research for Scottish Rite Freemasonry - revealing that the controllers of the occultic Scottish Rite are well aware that their witchcraft operations are consistent and integral with mind modification. BEARING THE BRUNT OF WILHELM WUNDT These aberrations are all traceable historically to the influence of Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1875-1920) of the University of Heidelbe rg, who took the chair of philosophy at the University of Leipzig, where he established the first psychological laboratory, founded a journal of 'Philosophical Studies', and redefined psychology, especially with respect to its application in education to train servants of the state. Education is a subset of human engineering. Wundt perversely believed that psychological studies should be based upon physical reactions. Humanity thus becomes essentially valueless in a mechanistic world - to be played around with, modified or destroyed at will, and with impunity. Wundt's research was adopted and applied by th e Prussian military and Government, and incorporated into a three-tiered schooling system in which 0.5% of pupils (the Akademie) are taught to think; 5.5% (Realschulen) are partially taught to think; and 94% (Volkschulen) of the students learn obedience, freedom from stressful thinking, and ho w to follow strict orders. It was therefore hardly surprising that the demoniac Adolf Hitler (Schicklgriiber) encountered little opposition among the general population to his hypnotic speeches, prescriptive demands and commands, as the fi rst generation of Berlin"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 201 schoolchildren brought up under the Volkschulen system were ripe for his manipulative mass behaviour modification offensive. The Volkschulen approach ensured that its students would not learn creative thinking, by dividing whole ideas into sub-subjects (mathematics, science etc) and then dividing these units into smaller units, and also by dividing time into small units. This is th e teaching methodology used to this day, although it has been overlaid by Outcome-Ba sed Education, which seeks to deliver young people with the 'correct' attitudes, and who have absorbed 'politically correct' concepts which, by definition, preclude creative thinking altogether. Modern education is also (deliberately) hampered by the demonic diversions provided by the insidious pop culture, which is a mass mind-control and behaviour modification transmission device to inculcate young minds with the Works of Darkness. The Luciferians behind this devilish assault on our children 3 believe that they have the upper hand not least because children (or, as they prefer to call them, after the goat, 'kids') are being brought up nowadays to be computer literate at an early age, a state of affairs which promotes what they regard as the most disrupted state of society, one of disassociation, in which the individual is isolated from other members of the group. His or her main interaction is with electronic media, which in turn is 'just perfect' for the Luciferian project, since the Internet has be en turned into the most efficient means for transmitting pornography ever invented: and the sexualisation of the young is 100% consistent with geomasonry and with the focus of all Masonry and witchcraft. Public health institutions have likewise been hijacked, or else founded in the first place as vehicles for the transmission of Luciferian propositions, one of the most notorious of which is a statement by Dr G. Brock Chisholm, who pronounced that 'the re-interpretation and eventual eradication of the concept of right and wrong are the belated objectives of nearly all psychotherapy'. No wonder an International Study Group for the Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Normal Humans discussed, at their conferen ce in 1967, the directions that mind-control and behaviour modification studies and results would follow up to the year 2000. These are all projects of the Luciferian cont rollers of the New Underworld Order. Since the 1960s, sodium fluoride has been added to water in many developed countries where Luciferian powers hold hidden levers of power and influence. This is done not to preserve tooth enamel, as was proclaimed, for instance, by an oral hygiene propaganda unit run by Gibbs Toothpaste (part of Unilever) in the 1960s, but as a means of controlling the population through mass medication, since this substance was thought to be a mechanism for the reduction of resistance to domination, cont rol and loss of liberty. The part of the brain responsible for an individual's power to resist domination is a small area of the brain tissue in the rear occiput of the left lobe. Repeated doses of tiny amounts of fluorine poison can narcotise this area, ostensibly rendering a pers on submissive to the will of persons seeking to control and govern him. Fluoride usage is a direct product of this Luciferian behaviour modification research. Charles Eliot Perkins, who was despatched by the US Government after the Second World War to annexe and take over I. G. Farben, the notorious manufacturers of Zyklon-B poison gas, stated that 'any person who drinks artificially fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person, mentally or physically'. As a corollary to this effective denial that the human being is anything more than a bunch of atoms, to be mani pulated at will, psychology according to Wundt became the study of the brain and the nervous syst em, discarding the notion that human"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"202 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler beings have souls on the basis that if something is not scientifically quantifiable, it is not worthy of investigation. And Wundt's infl uence spread to the East as well as to the West: for example, Lenin's favourite psycho logist, Ivan Pavlov (Pavloff), studied physiology in Leipzig. Pavlov unravelled patterns of animal behaviour through his experiments with dogs: in 1906, for instance, he measured their salivation by cutting holes in their cheeks, into which he inserted tubes. In his book 'Bio-Dynamics: The Battle for Youth' [1930], Dr Boris Sokoloff 4 recalled Professor Ivan Pavloff, whom Lenin consulted during a 'sabbatical' lasting several months at his dacha, pronouncing: 'There is no soul; there is only a reflex - a difference in electrical potentials and an increase in ions and irritation. We should not try to make an issue of our weakness by allowing ourselves even to think that we shall never understand this or that. We must understand everything and we sh all. This will come to be'. The influence of Wundt on psychology, psychiatry and education in the United States was paralleled, thanks to the studies undertaken by the key mid-19th century Bonesmen Gilman, Dwight and Russell, by th e influence of Hegel, whose dialectical method is central to the modus operandi of all Luciferian control practitioners, from the revolutionary Leninists to members of The Or der. The dialectic postulates that every force (Thesis) creates or is confronted by an opposing force (Antithesis), creating conflict, which in turn generates a thir d force, namely Synthesis (The sis + Antithesis = Synthesis). The hotbed of Hegelian theorising has for a century been Johns Hopkins University, which 'figures', given its Skull and Bones origins and connections. In the United States, the so-called 'father' of behaviourist psychology is reckoned to be John Broadus Watson (1878-1958), the evil Wundtian behavioural scientist who emerged from the heavily German-influenced University of Chicago where he learned all about Wilhelm Wundt and perversely taught th at a child's wishes, needs and feelings should be treated as though they did not exist. This doctrine of Satan, which contravenes Jesus Christ's exp licit teaching that no-one can enter into the Kingdom of God unless they humble themselves as little children, has dama ged millions of young people for more than two generations. Watson is notorious for havi ng boasted that he could take any 20 human infants and, by applying behavioural techniques, could create out of them whatever kind of person that he wished, whether beggar, butcher or thief. Children were to be removed from their mothers during the third or fourth week, otherwise attachments were sure to develop. Watson, who seemed to hate love, argued that mothers loved their babies for sexual reasons: otherwise, why would they kiss their ch ildren on the lips? He loathed mothers whose 'excessive affection' rendered a child forever dependent and emotionally unstable (the absolute reverse of the truth of course, as the Devil turns everything upside down). Children, therefore, should never be kissed, hugged or a llowed to sit on their mothers' laps. Any occasional kissing should be confined to the forehead. Parents would soon discover their capacity for being 'perfectly objective' and yet kindly towards their children. The Author remembers an aunt who behaved exactly as prescribed by Watson: naturally, she was considered hard-hearted, cold and aloof. Watson's behaviourism placed emphasis on the external behaviour of people and on their reactions to given situ ations, rather than on the internal, mental and spiritual condition of the people concerned. In the obtu se opinion of this fellow, analysis of the behaviour and the reactions human beings was the only objective method of gaining insight into human behaviour: which of course made sense from his warped perspective, since as a follower of Wundt he dismissed the ideas of spirit and soul as make-"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 203 believe. Another misguided Wundt student - a nd US military intelligence operative -B. F. Skinner, developed operant conditioning and was the evil inventor of the 'Skinner Box', a crib-sized container into which children are placed for the purposes of conducting mind- control research, and for conditioning purposes. For instance, one of the favoured techniques, extensively used in Illuminati training sessions, is placing a child in such a confin ed space with a rabbit, and telling the child that he will not be released until he has stra ngled the rabbit. This diabolical practice is designed to procure that the child becomes indiffe rent to inflicting pain without flinching, and to killing without flinching (as explained by Fr. Malachi Martin). The Author has established independently from US experts with direct Illuminati family background experience that this abomination is precisely as described here. PROJECT BLUEBIRD-ARTICHOKE-MK-ULTRA-MK-SEARCH mind-control experimentatio n in narcohypnotic techniques was initiated during the 1940s in a number of formerly belligerent countries. Project BL UEBIRD (relaunched as ARTICHOKE in August 1951 in a cover-up exercise), headed by Morse Allen, was mounted by US intelligence (the Joint Intelligence Committee) to develop methods of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorise d extraction of information from them. LSD, first synthesised by Sandoz Laboratories in B asel, Switzerland, in 1938 and by Dr Albert Hoffmann in 1943, arrived in the United States in 1949. Its arrival was an ingredient in the US intelligence community's developing work on the manipulation of human behaviour and mind-control, which 'blossomed' (to use a totally inappropriate word here) with Richard Helms' recommendation that the CI A must expand its research into both offensive and defensive brainwashing which became MK-ULTRA. Experiments with LSD were conducted by a Dr Harris Isbell, and overseen on behalf of the Scottish Rite by Robert Hanna Felix: one of these experiments involved giving Black prison inmates LSD for 75 consecutive days, with the dosage being increased whenever tolerance for LSD was indicated. In a similar experiment at Pont Sain t-Esprit in France in 1951, the entire town went raving mad. One of the leading US mind-control experts, George Estabrooks, conducted research into the creation of hypnotically programmed couriers and into the hypnotic induction of split personalities. Thes e victims, often used as hands-on operatives, have handlers like all other intelligence operatives, who can trigger pre-programmed reactions in the subject, such as ordering him to undertake an assassination (programmed omega subjects). The American analyst Michael E. Kreca has e xpertly summarised the sordid history of the US Government's contribution to the Un ited States' drug problem, in the following manner 5 . In September 1942, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Director and Army Major General William 'Wild Bill' Donovan began his sear ch for an effective 'truth serum', to be used on prisoners of war and captured spies. Starting with a budget of $5,000 and the blessing of President Franklin Roosevelt, he enlisted the aid of a few prominent physicians and mind-control psychiatrists such as George Estabrooks and Harry Murray as well as the former Prohibition agent and notorious Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) Director Harry Anslinger. The OSS/FBN team first tested a potent marijuana extract, tetrahydrocannabinol acetate (THCA), a colourless, odourless substance, lacing cigarettes or food items with it, and administering them to volunteer US Army and OSS personnel, all of whom eventually acquired the nickname 'Donovan's Dreamer s'. Testing was also conducted under"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"204 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler the guise of treatment for shell shock, the original Tavistock Institute remit. Donovan's team found that THCA, which they termed 'TD', for 'truth drug', induced 'a great loquacity and hilarity', and even, in cases where the subject didn't feel physically threatened, some useable 'reefer madness'. Peyote, morphine and scopo- lamine were judged too powerful to be used in e ffective interrogation. In the light of all this, Donovan concluded, 'the drug defies all but th e most expert and search analysis, and for all practical purposes can be considered beyond analysis'. The OSS did not, however, end the programme. By that time, faced with the terrifying ship losses th e United States was suffering because of the efficiency of German U-boats, Donovan pressed on, hoping to find some effective chemical means to help in the interrogation of captured German U-boat sailors and naval officers. In May 1943, George Hunter White, an Army captain, OSS offi cer and former FBN agent, gave standard cigarettes laced with THCA to an unwitting August Del Grazio, an influential New York City gangster nickname d 'Augie Dallas'. Del Grazio, who by then had done prison stretches for assault and murder , had been one of the Mafia's most notorious enforcers and narcotics smugglers. Michael Kr eca's analysis reveals that he operated an opium alkaloid factory in Turkey and was a key participant in the long-running Istanbul/Marseilles /NYC heroin pipeline commonly know n as the 'French Connection'. Influenced by the THC, Del Grazio (who was al so helping to smuggle spies and Mafiosi into German-occupied Italy) revealed volumes of vital information about underworld operations, including the names of several high-ranking city and state officials who took bribes from the Mob. Donovan was encouraged by the results of White's tests, commenting in writing that 'Cigarette experiments indicated that we had a mechanism offering promise in relaxing prisoners to be interrogated'. The extensive wartime German (Himmlerian) experiments with various hallucinogenic drugs at the Dachau concentration camp, directed by Dr Hubertus Strughold, later honoured as 'the father of aviation medicine', aroused great interest in the United States - especially after a US Navy Intelligence technical mission to Dachau in October 1945 reported in detail on Strughold's work. So great was the US official interest in what had been going on at Dachau, in fact, that when the OSS and its successor, the CIA, imported nearly 800 German scientists of various specialties unde r the auspices of the infamous 'Project Paperclip' during 1945-55, it made sure to include Dr. Strughold. Dr. Strughold's barbaric 'medical experime nts', for which his subordinates were tried and convicted as war criminals at Nuremburg, were nothing more than a series of bizarre and unspeakably brutal Satanic tortures. Even so, he learned a lot about human behaviour and mescaline, a natural alkaloid present in the peyote cactus. Mescaline, long central to many Native American religious rituals and first chemically isolated in 1896, is a phenethylamine, the ergoline skeleton of which is also contained in lysergic acid (a tryptamine). Sandoz Laboratories' chief chemist Dr. Albert Hofmann also discovered a lysergic acid derivative called ergonovine, a medication used to retard excessive postpartum uterine bleeding. Based on his work with ergonovine, Dr. Hofmann initially derived d-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate-25 (LSD, a refined alkaloidal liquid byproduct of the rye fungus, ergot) in a series of experime nts in Zurich in 1938. He us ed the naturally occurring lysergic acid radical, the common item in all ergot alkaloids, as the major component of the substance. Further experiments in this vein yielded psilocybin, derived from the Mexican Psilocybe Cubensis mushroom, hydergine, essential today in the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 205 Figure 38: The images of covers of Congressional reports are shown here and in the following pages in order to provide precise indications of certain published sources of open domain information on CIA-'Tavistock School' mind- and personality-manipulation and abusive research activities, such as near-death trauma, conducted in the German Himmlerian tradition by the US intelligence community."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"206 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler improvement of cerebral circulation in geriatric patients, and dihydroergotamine, an important ingredient in blood pressure medication. The well-read and broadly educated Dr. Hofmann knew that ergot had a long natural and cultural history as both a medicine and a poison. Ancient Gree k midwives used to give an ergot-based, gruel-like drink, called kykeon, to their patients who were about to give birth. Kykeon was also consumed during the autumn Eleusinia, the ancient Greek agricultural festival celebrated in honor of the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Across the Atlantic, sacramental Maya morning glories, beautifully depicted at the ancient Mayan temple-palace complex at Teotihuacn, Mexico, dating to about 1450, also contained ergot- based alkaloids. However, the mindset governing the drug research work conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intellig ence Agency (DIA) was far different from that of Dr. Hofmann's. To the Cold War spymasters , ex-Nazis like Dr. Strughold were definitely evil, but they were useful as well. This pervasiv e amoral pragmatism led, of course, to the odious, notorious and repellent MK-ULTRA experimentation, developed by Dr Sydney Gottlieb [see page 208], in which, for nearly 25 years, thousands of everyday Americans, both military and civilian, were heavily closed with numerous very potent artificial psychoactive drugs, often without their knowledge or consent. An unknown number of foreign, including British, individuals, were targeted in 'remot e' psychological manipulation exercises by Dr Gottlieb's 'scientists'. The pervasive amorality of this Himmlerian experimentation also led to the prevailing US intelligence community culture of 'anything goes, as we are protected by the National Security Act et seq., and there's nothing anyone can do about it, not even Congress, as we have our people in all the top intelligence, policymaking and political slots'. Michael Kreca elaborated that this phenomenon of the obsessive focus and reliance upon 'the interests of national security' - the expediency mentality - combined with the United States' celebrity-obsessed pop culture which gleefully raises and shamelessly promotes snake oil hustlers as well as th e pharmaceutical industry's expensive 'pill for every ill' philosophy, was a recipe for incomp etence and arrogance far more hazardous than any synthetic alkaloid that had been developed, and came as no surprise to experts like Dr. Hofmann. LSD proved to be invaluable in the psychiatric treatment of certain patients: the actor Cary Grant was cured of alcoholism by car efully administered doses of the drug under close medical supervision, because it is thousands of times more potent than the traditional herbal mixtures. In fact, it is thousands of times more potent than the milder of the entheogenic alkaloids. It is effective at doses of as little as a ten-millionth of a gram, which makes it 5,000 times more potent than mescaline. It should never be taken without training or supervision, Michael Kreca warned. The Navy tested mescaline as part of its 1947-53 Project CHATTER. The personality- modification Project MK-ULTRA itself was first organised in 1949 by Richard Helms under the direction of the German Abwehr agent Allen Dulles, and was initially labelled as Project BLUEBIRD. Two years later, it was renamed ARTICHOKE (after one of Dulles's favourite foods), and then it was relabelled MK-ULTRA in 1953 - finally becoming MK-SEARCH in 1965 until the program's 'official termination' eight years later. MK-ULTRA was directly responsible for the sudden wide underground availability of LSD, phencyclidine (PCP, also called 'angel dust'), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 2,5- dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (STP), and ot her very powerful synthetic psychoactive drugs in the 1960s.

Dr. Hofmann and Sandoz refused this request, so the CIA Director Allen Dulles persuaded the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical luminary organisation, first mentioned in Chapter 2, Eli Lilly (later the pioneers of and chief cheerleaders for th e widely prescribed antidepressant Prozac) to synthesise the drug contrary to then existing international patent accords - making the US Government and Lilly the first illegal domestic manufacturers and distributors of LSD. The product was distributed via the Central Intelligence Agency's organised crime allies and through the FBI' s counterintelligence programmes (COINTELPROs) directed against various revolutionary activist groups of the period. The actual definition of the codename MK-ULTRA remains, for some, uncl ear; but a former Army Special Forces Captain, John McCarthy, who ran the CIA's Sa igon-based Operation Cherry which targeted the Cambodian ruler Prince Sihanouk for assassination, claimed, with Edwin Wilson [see Chapter 3] that MK-ULTRA did (does) indeed stand for 'Manufactur ing Killers Utilizing Lethal Tradecraft Requiring Assassination'. On April 10, 1953, in a speech at Princeton University, the CIA's Director of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles (further feeding the al ready widespread but misguided fear about the high effectiveness of the alleged Chinese 'brainwashing' of US prisoners of war in the Korean context) warned that the human mind wa s a 'malleable tool', and that the 'brain perversion techniques' of the Communists were 'so subtle and so abhorrent' that 'the brain becomes a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control'. What Mr Dulles concealed, of course, was that Britain and the United States had been working overtime on perfecting similar techniques for many years, and that the original sources and inspiration fo r these aberrations was the same. He also concealed the DVD propaganda component of his warnings. In its simplest and most odious form, propaganda involves condemning one's opponent publicly for doing what one is already doing privately. One characteristic of liars and deceivers is that they usually accuse th eir opponents of the sins that they are committing themselves. Dulles, of course, was that very 'outside genius'. Three days after warning assembled Princetonians of the disturbing ramifications of these techniques, he had directed MK-ULTRA researchers to perfect them. Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the CIA's expert on lethal poisons, (who was reputedly the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's bizarre Dr. St rangelove character played by Peter Sellers in the 1964 film of the same title) led the opera tion as the Director of the Chemical Division of the Technical Services Staff and, via a fr ont organisation called The Society For Human Ecology, and distributed $25 million worth of drug research grants to Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley and other US institutions. In later life, Dr Gottlieb became well-known for his enigmatic observation that 'the bottom line on this whole business has not yet been written'. Gottlieb was among many prominent behaviour modification and mind-control experts from Germany, of Jewish extraction, who have collaborated over the decades to create the new hell on earth which the Luciferians have been constructing not least in order to destroy True Christianity (which is impossible). In the 1960s, Gottlieb travelled to the Congo, with a little black bag containing a biotoxin destined for the toothbrush of his target, Patrice Lumumba.

After exhausting his financial resources, Andy made the fatal mistake of travelling to Washington DC, in search of a lobbying job on Capitol Hill. On the return flight to Seattle, he was violently ill, and shortly afterwards was diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas 6 . The late Jimmy Goldsmith, the British businessman turned founder of the since-defunct Referendum Party, mysteriously developed cancer of the pancreas within 18 months of his starting to write and give speeches against free trade and Britain's participation in the European Union Collective. On investigating these and other mysterious deaths, the Author established from impeccab le intelligence sources that the favoured technique is to enter the target's hotel bedroom while he is out attending a conference or meetings, and to inject his toothpaste tube with the biotoxin du jour, which may also be applied to the toothbrush. The reason for this procedure is that biotoxins are most efficiently and rapidly absorbed via the underneath of the tongue. Poor Mozart was poisoned when, through 'The Magic Flute', he exposed the occult evils of Freemasonry, despite his reliance on financial handouts from known Masons. When Captain William Morgan exposed Freemasonry with his little book, published in 1827, entitled 'Illustrations of Freemasonry' [from which the old drawings of Masonic 'grips' etc shown in Addendum 10 on page 734 and on page 10 are taken], he was murdered. Stephen Knight, the British author of 'T HE Brotherhood: The Secret World of the Freemasons' 7 , one of the first modern exposures of Freemasonry, was likewise liquidated. Wherever possible, Illuminati assassinations, as in the case of Mozart, are conducted by means of poisoning; and the modern focus has been on developing biotoxins which mimic natural illnesses. The pancreas being one of the most se nsitive of all the internal organs, a Himmlerian biotoxin has been developed which either mimics or creates cancer of the pancreas, which has the 'advantage' that the victim appears normal until close to the end. For two decades, the odious Dr Sidney Gottlieb, the US Government's leading poisoner (who died and descended to hell on 10th March 2005), presided over the CIA's Technical Services Division, where he supervised the invention and preparation of lethal poisons, experiments in mind-control and the administration of LSD and other psycho-active drugs to unwitting subjects. There remains a possibility that the CIA had been concerned that Gottlieb, who was tending to move towards tentative 'repentance' in his declining years, may have been about to expose a wide range of the CIA's most diabolical programmes, amid the general revulsion at the atrocities committed by CIA-linked operatives at Abu Ghraib and many other locations in Iraq, Jo rdan, Afghanistan, and on the British Territory (leased to the United States) of Diego Garcia). The Abu Ghraib atrocities were simply el aborations of certain abominations com- mitted in the context of the CIA's demoni c Phoenix Program, supervised by William Colby in Vietnam. A team of CIA 'Wehrmacht' 'psychologists' established a base at Bien Hoa Prison near Saigon, where suspects were being held after Phoenix Program round- ups. They proceeded to perform Himmlerian experiments on the prisoners. In one of these, three prisoners were anaesthetised, their skulls were opened, and electrodes were implanted by CIA doctors into different parts of their brains. The prisoners were revived, placed in a room and given knives while the electrodes were ac tivated. The CIA observers 'hoped' they would attack each other. When they didn't, they were shot dead."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 211 MIDNIGHT CLIMAX: USING SEX FOR CONTROL AND ENTRAPMENT Earlier, George Hunter White, of THCA-laced 'Lucky Strikes' fame, had returned to the FBN (now the Drug Enforcement Administration) at the end of the war, where he continued to research behaviour modifying drugs. In 1955, he was a high ranking FBN administrator who helped the CIA develop and implement a similar operation called MIDNIGHT CLIMAX. In this infamous scheme, 'safe houses ' staffed with prostitutes were established in San Francisco. The hookers lured men from local taverns back to these safe houses after their drinks had previously been spiked with LSD. White's team secretly filmed the subsequent events in each house. The purp ose of these so-called 'national security brothels' was to enable the CIA to experiment with the use of sex and mind-altering drugs to extract information from test subjects - and, it was planned, from spies, prisoners of war, defectors and saboteurs. The sex entrapment apparatus run out of premises close to Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, was and is an ongoing byproduct of this 'research'. It performs the function of entrapping diplomats and other targets for espionage and blackmail purposes. Not all diplomats are suitable fodder for invitations to the Bohemian Grove in California, which specialises in blackmail entrapment. MIDNIGHT CLIMAX was ostensibly terminated after eight years when the CIA's Inspector-General of the day, John Earman, charged that 'the concepts involved in manipulating human behaviour are found by many people within and outside the Agency to be distasteful and unethical'. It would be reassuring if this perspective had made the slightest difference to the way this criminalised organisation behaves, but of course it hasn't. Mr Earman asserted that 'the rights and interests of US citizens were placed in jeopardy'. Earman further noted that LSD 'had been tested on individuals at all social levels, high and low, native American and foreign'. MK-ULTRA's bureaucratic godfather, Richard Helms, summarily rebuffed Earman's charges, claiming that 'positive operational capacity to use drugs is diminishing, owing to a lack of realistic testing. Tests', Helms continued, 'were necessary to keep up with the Soviets'. However, Helms reversed hi mself a year later when testifying before the Warren Commission, the cover-up operation headed by Gerald Ford (a.ka. the alleged pornography boss Leslie Lynch King. Jr.) investigating the assassination of President Kennedy, claiming that 'Soviet research has consistently lagged five years behind Western research'. Upon formal retirement from the bureaucracy in 1966, George White wrote a startling farewell letter to Dr. Gottlieb. He reminisced about his MIDNIGHT CLIMAX work, and uttered these notorious, cynical and frightening observations, which have since become legendary: 'I was a very minor missionary, actually a heretic, but I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fu n, fun. Where else could a red-bl ooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the all-highest?' Where else indeed, but as a member of what would later become the hypocritical War on Drugs, as cover for drug-trafficking? For by the end of the 1950s, the CIA was financing just about every qualified LSD researcher and psychologist it could find, through contractors such as the Society for the Study of Human Ecology In 1966, Richard Helms ordered the destruction of MK-ULTRA's files, but of course the work continued, and Congressional hearings on the subject were being conducted as late as 1977 [see Figures 38-39] - with the CIA's mind-control research supervised up to 1973 by Dr Sidney Gottlieb.

MK-ULTRA experimentation, in which Vice-President Richard Cheney was allegedly involved in a senior supervisory role, did not of course follow standards for medical experimentation (such as informed consent) establish ed at Nuremberg. Between 1958 and 1960, LSD tests were conducted to establish how an LSD-dosed soldier would behave under interrogation. By the mid-1960s , at least 1,500 US Chemical Corps army personnel had been subjected to LSD expe rimentation. The psychoactive compound quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ), first tested at Edgewood Arsenal in 1959, was given to about 2,800 soldiers and was deployed in grenades, mo rtar shells and missiles used in Vietnam. In MK-ULTRA training of Navy personnel for deploy ment in 'combat readiness units', the men were strapped to chairs with their eyelids clamped open and were forced to watch films of carnage until they were desensitised . One report says that these men were also compelled to watch propaganda aimed at the dehumanisation and vilification of other cultures, which they were required to hate. Meanwhile Aldous Huxley (whose homosexual lover was D. H. Lawrence), of the Tavistock Institute, and a member of th e filthy British drug and homosexuality cult called Children of the Sun, spearheaded a Tavist ock project to intoxicate elements of the US population with LSD in about 1950 (an episode the trademarks of which have been obliterated by the subsequent LSD period publicised by Dr Timothy Leary: see below). The gullible American population was pr epared for LSD by Huxley's very evil book, The Doors of Perception. Huxley pronounced that 'there w ill be in the next generation or so, a phar- macological method of making pe ople love their servitude, and producing ... a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies' . The diabolical Esalen Institute at Big Sur, California sponsors, to this day, meditationa l and psychoesoteric training with links to Aldous Huxley. The US Army reservation on th e former US military base at The Presidio, outside San Francisco, is the location of a Sa tanic child molestation ring with which the notorious US military intelligence operative Colonel Michael Aquino, the head of the Temple of Set, was associated. A military r esearch laboratory there develops, tests and modifies advanced US Government mind-control knowledge and applications. THE JOLLY JAPES OF LOUIS JOLYON WEST These evil activities were then developed in the following manner. An employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Jerry Garcia, was employed to channel youth dissent and rebellion into 'benign' and non-threatening directions. Still in the 1950s, the US Public Health Service [sic!!] meanwhile employed the services of the pr ominent LSD proponent, Dr Timothy Leary, to popular ised the use of LSD, which was of course extremely damaging to those who followed this evil example. The intended mass infusion of LSD into US culture was contrived to turn the masses aw ay from political activism and towards a life of 'ecstatic mystic peasantry' - an objective that has comprehensively fa iled. Dr Leary's drug experiments, undertaken at Harvard University, were funded by the CIA, which also trained or trains operatives to raise children to become sex slaves (Project MONARCH slaves). A number of covert mind-control slave camps are known to exist in the United States, of which Mount Shasta is one. On the day of the Oklahoma City bombing - a mass traumatisation event, like the assassination of President Kennedy and 9/11, which was intended to influence and affect the United States' national identity and cohesiveness, to fracture the souls of the American people and to accustom them to the perception that the nation and its"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 213 Government are subject to hidden forces beyond their control - a certain Dr Louis Jolyon West appeared on the prime-time Larry King Live nationwide TV show, which is thought to be extensively used to deceive the American pe ople, to characterise Timothy McVeigh as yet another 'lone nutcase'. And who was Louis Jolyon West, mercifully no longer with us to torment humanity (1924-99)? On 2 January 1999, this evil man, a key US mind -control specialist, died, like Lenin, of a rapidly advancing malignant tumour which even he lacked the power to overcome. Formerly the celebrated psychiatric consultant to the US Air Force, occupant of the Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at the University of California, and Director of its Neuropsychiatric Institute, Lo s Angeles (UCLA), this fellow was born in Brooklyn, of immigrant Russian-Jewish parents. After enlisting in the military, he was sent to the University of Iowa where he par ticipated in a secret specialised training programme. His later work on behaviour modification and mind-control for US intelligence developed into an extensive study of cults, torture and brainwashing. He worked in particular as a court-appointed psychiatrist , examining Jack Ruby, the murderer of Lee Harvey Oswald. During the Korean War, West studied So viet and Chinese techniques of brain- washing and torture. He said at the time that US prisoners-of-war had falsely confessed to engaging in germ warfare because their capto rs had instilled a sense of guilt in them through solitary confinement, prolonged sleeplessness and physical abuse, which he described as the classic tools of brainwashi ng. These 'just happen' to be precisely the 'tools' employed by US intelligence and its 'cut-ouf torturing and interrogation organ- isations like CACI at Abu Ghraib and the large number of similar enterprises scattered around Iraq and Afghanistan. In the course of his research, West demonstrated that prisoners could become convinced of their own guilt by these same 'tools' of solitary confinement, physical abuse and lack of sleep. He extended these findings to his study of cults, pontificating that they practice 'the three Ds: debility, dread and dependency'. He was accused by some of killing an elephant named Tusko at Oklahoma Zoo in the 1960s with an overdose of LSD, while he was directing an LSD research programme for the CIA at the University of Oklahoma. In 1962, Louis Jolyon West published a tome on hallucinations, which he had edited, consisting of papers by prominent members of the American Psychiatric Association and other scientists on such issu es as the spiritual effects of LSD and the experiences of schizophrenics. Dr West was cleared at TOP SECRET level fo r work on MK-ULTRA operations. He was to have headed the UCLA Violence Project, which had been approved by President Reagan but which was ostensibly cancelled in response to public protest. The project was to have been housed in a Nike missile site outside Los Angeles, in the Santa Monica mountains. In his book 'Journey Into Madness', the British writer Gordon Thomas says that Dr West had proposed (but this Author suspects that the CIA had proposed) the creation of a financially well-endowed multidisciplinary Center for the Study and Reduction of Violence, within the confines of which doctors would explore all types of violent behaviour, what caused it, and how it could be detected, prevented and treated. The Center was to have dealt with individuals who displayed antisocial and impulsive aggression tendencies. Its laboratories were to specialise in genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological studies of 'violent individuals, including prisoners and hyperkinetic children'. This proposal was enthusiastically promoted by Governor Ronald Reagan of California, but the State Legislature thought it was evil, and refused to sanction the devel- opment of the means to enable the State to monitor individuals with implants from cen-"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"214 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler tral control stations. Two South American doctors, working at detention centres in Paraguay and Chile, who were familiar with the work of Himmler's Dr Mengele, were to have been recruited for this Satanic project with which Ronald Reagan was so enamoured: one was to run the Center's shock room, and the other was to direct the Center's psychosurgical operating unit, where the latest lobotomy techniques were to be used. In 1994, \"The Times', London, estimated that 15,000 people had been implanted with elec- tronic brain devices during the preceding decade. A number of other abhorrent CIA mind-control MK-ULTRA programs were sup- posedly cancelled - although the frequency w ith which such cancellations have been reported suggests to the Auth or that these 'cancellations' ma y represent disinformation. One was a proposal to implant brain electrodes in prisoners at Vacaville State Prison, California, the site of Himmlerian CIA mind-control experiments on the drug pemoline under another related programme called MK-SEA RCH. The prisoners were to be monitored by remote tracking technology after discharge. If they entered a restricted area or exhibited sexual arousal patterns on remote EEG equipment, a signal would be sent to their brain electrodes immobilising them, while law enforcement personnel would be despatched to apprehend them. A second mind-control experiment at Vacaville State Prison, set up in February 1972, was also supposedly 'aborted'. A Maximum Psychiatric Diagnostic Unit there was to deal with selected inmates fr om the 700 held in solitary confinement in California prisons. A Luciferian programme, evolved from experiments such as those performed in Bien Hoa prison, near Saigon, in 1968, was developed for this unit, under which prisoners would have electrodes implante d in their brains to monitor them and to control their behaviour after discharge, using radio transmitters. Following public outrage, the California Department of Corrections called a press conference on 30th December 1977 to announce that the project had been 'temporarily abandoned for administrative reasons'. Other 'shutdowns' of nefarious programmes, attributable to negative public reaction, have been recorded - two notable in stances being the Tuskeegee Syphilis Study and the Lafayette Clinic Aggression Project. These supposed closures of Himmlerian pr ogrammes - which may well have been continued, of course, under different cover - demonstrate that when information about the evil practices of the hidden Luciferian estab lishment leak into th e public domain, the American public (especially the Californian public, which has a commendable record in this respect) can be mobilised to a sufficient extent at least to make life temporarily inconvenient for these evil people - who include the Harvard brain electrode team, doctors from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the Navy Medical Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in San Diego, and the Veterans Administration Hospital, Salt Lake City. An outfit calling itself the False Memory Syndrome Found ation, with a board consisting of CIA and military doctors, exists not to investigate the 'syndrome', but in fact to disprove claims of cult mind-control - in order (of course) to cover up behaviour modification and mind- control operations of US intel ligence which are in danger of being exposed by the victims, their handlers, or both (as in the case with which Mark Phillips is associated, even thought it appears that Phillips is or was neverthele ss also engaged in establishing whether a MONARCH Slave can be permanently deprogrammed). It was, by the way, that man of darkness, Dr. Gottlieb, from Ge rmany, who sponsored CIA research by the notorious Dr Ewen Camer on at McGill University, Montreal, where he routinely dosed psychiatric subjects with jolts of electricity through their brains. What degree of demonic madness accounted for such abominations is hard to imagine."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 215 THE NAZI CONNECTION ACTUALLY 'TOOK OFF' DURING THE WAR Writing in their 1998 book 'Whiteout: the CIA, Drugs and the Press' [ISBN: 1-85984-8974], Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair revealed that the United States' enthusiastic infatuation with Heinrich Himmler's Illuminati Toten-scientists can be traced back to 1944, although as we have seen the German penetration in this dimension began in the 1930s. The story of the recruitment of Nazi scientists and warfare technicians by the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency is well told in two excellent but unjustly neglected books: Tom Bower's 'The Paperclip Conspiracy' (1987) 9 and Linda Hunt's 'Secret Agenda' (1991 ) 10 . Hunt's reporting in particular, is first rate. Exploiting the Freedom of Information Act, she opened up thousands of pages of crucial documents from the Pentagon, the State Department and the CIA that should keep researchers occupied for years to come. Information about experiments by the Nazi doctors was surfaced primarily from the trial record of the medical cases conducted at the Nuremberg tribunal, from Alexander Mitscherlich and Fred Mielke's 'Doctors of Infamy' (1981) 11 , and Robert Proctor's frightening account in 'Racial Hygiene' (1988) 12 . The US Government's research into biological warfare is admirably profiled in Jeanne McDermott's book, 'The Killing Winds' (1979) 13 . The best account of the US Government's role in developing and deploying chemical warfare agents remains Seymour Hersh's book 'Chemical and Biological Warfare' (1969) 14 from the late 1960s. In an attempt to track down the cause of Gulf War Syndrome (which he perhaps 'didn't realise' was allegedly caused by aspartame in soft drink consignments), Senator Jay Rockefeller held a series of remarkable hearings on human experimentation by the US Government. These studies are cited to provide further references beyond the scope of this broader enquiry, which focuses on pan-German global control plans and their integration into the Dluminati dimension of Germany's Luciferian offensive. The mass exodus of Himmler's Nazi scientists inter alia to the United States was not, as all analysts have hitherto assumed, so lely a consequence of corrupt and pragmatic decisions made by amoral American and British intelligence officers and misguided policymakers, but was also - crucially, as is e xplained in Chapter 8 - an intended corollary of subtle Nazi propaganda and influence-building operations masterminded from the German Geopolitical Centre set up by the Nazis in Madrid in 1942. Anyone who loses sight of this central fact will miss the whole point of this book. In their remarkable analysis, Cockburn and St Clair explained that 'a careful review of the activities of the CIA and the organisations from which it sprang reveals an intense preoccupation with the development of techniques of behaviour control, brainwashing and covert medical and psychic experimentation on unwitting subjects including religious sects, ethnic minorities, prisoners, mental pati ents, soldiers and the terminally ill. The rationale for such activities, the techniques and indeed the human subjects chosen show an extraordinary and chilling similarity to Nazi experiments. This similarity becomes less surprising when we trace the determined and of ten successful efforts of US intelligence officers to acquire the records of Nazi experiments, and in many cases to recru it the Nazi researchers themselves and put them to work - transferring the laboratories from Dachau, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Auschwitz and Buchenwald to Edgewood Arsenal, Fort Derrick, Huntsville Air Force Base, Ohio State, and the University of Washington'. Thus the Nazi International contrived with great skill to transfer Himmler's Satanic operations to the eager United States. 'As Allied forces crossed the English Channel during the D-Day invasion in June 1944, some 10,000 intelligence officers known as T-Forces were right behind the advance bat-"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"216 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler talions. Their mission was to seize munitions experts, technicians, German scientists and their research materials, along with French scientists who had collaborated with the Nazis. Soon a substantial number of such scientists had been picked up and placed in an internment camp known as the Dustbin. In the original planning for the mission a prime factor was the view that German military equipment - tanks, jets, rocketry and so forth - was technically superior and that captured sc ientists, technicians and engineers could be swiftly debriefed in an effort by the Allies to catch up'. 'Then, in December 1944, Bill Donovan, head of the OSS, and Allen Dulles [the German Abwehr deep cover intelligence agent - Ed.], OSS head of intelligence operations in Europe operating out of Switzerland, strongly urged FDR to approve a plan allowing Nazi intelligence officers, scientists and industrialists to be \"given permission for entry into the United States after the war and the placing of their earnings on deposit in an American bank and the like\". FDR swiftly turned the proposal down, saying: \"We expect that the number of Germans who are anxious to save th eir skins and property, will rapidly increase. Among them may be some who should properly be tried for war crimes, or at least arrested for active participation in Nazi activities. Even with the necessary controls you mention, I am not prepared to authorize th e giving of guarantees'\". But Cockburn and St Clair pointed out that 'this presidential veto was a dead letter even as it was being formulated'. A scheme codenamed Operation Overcast was under way as early as July 1945, approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its purpose was to bring into the United States 350 German Nazi scien tists, including Werner Von Braun and his V2 rocket team, chemical weapons designers, and artillery and submarine engineers. There had been some theoretical ban on Nazis being import ed, but this was as empty as FDR's edict. In addition to Von Braun, the Overcast shipment included such notorious Nazis and SS officers as Dr. Herbert Axster, Dr. Arthur Rudolph and Georg Richkey. Von Braun's team had used slave labor from the Dora concentration camp and had worked prisoners to death in the Mittelwerk complex: indeed, more than 20,000 had died there from exhaustion and starvation. 'The supervising slavemaster was Richkey. In retaliation against sabotage in the missile plant - prisoners would urinate on electrical equipment, causing spectacular malfunctions - Richkey would hang them, twelve at a time from the factory cranes, with w ooden sticks shoved into their mouths to muffle their cries. In the Dora camp itself, he re garded children as useless mouths and instructed the SS guards to club them to death, which they did'. This record did not inhibit Richkey's high-speed transfer to the United States, the authors reported, 'where he was deployed at Wright Field, a US Army Air Corps base near Dayton, Ohio'. Richkey was then put to work overseeing security for dozens of other Nazis who were by now pursuing their res earches for the United States. 'He was also assigned the task of translating all of the records from the Mittelwerk factory. He thus had the opportunity, which he used to the utmost, to destroy any material compromising to his colleagues and himself. By 1947 there was enough public disquiet, stimulated by the columnist Drew Pearson, to require a pro forma war crimes trial for Richkey and a few others. Richkey was sent back to West Germany and put through a secret trial supervised by the US Army, which had every reason to clear Richkey since conviction would disclose that the entire Mittelwerk team now in the US had been accomp lices in the use of slavery and the torture and killing of prisoners of war, and thus were also guilty of war crimes. The US Army therefore sabotaged Richkey's trial by withholding records now in the United States and also by preventing any interrogation of Von Braun"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 217 and others from Dayton: and Ri chkey was acquitted. Because some of the trial materials implicated Rudolph, Von Braun and Walter Domberger, however, the entire record was classified and held secret for forty years, thus burying evidence that could have sent the entire rocket team to the gallows'. 'Senior officers of the US Army knew the trut h. Initially the recruitment of German war criminals was justified as being necessary to the continuing war against Japan. Later, moral justification took the form of invoking \"intellectual reparations\" or, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff put it, as \"a form of explo itation of chosen rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use\". Endorsement for this repellent posture came from a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, which adopted the colleg-ial pos ition that German scientists had somehow evaded the Nazi contagion by being \"an island of nonconformity in the Nazified body politic\", a statement that Von Braun, Richkey and the other slave drivers must have deeply appreciated' 15 . But these excuses were soon overwhelmed by a much more saleable proposition. 'By 1946, a rationale based on Cold War strategy was becoming more important. Nazis were needed in the struggle against Communism, and their capabilities certainly had to be withheld from the Soviets. In September 1946, President Harry Truman approved the Dulles- inspired Project Paperclip, the mission of which was to bring a targeted 1,000 Nazi scientists to the United States. Among them were many of the vilest criminals of the war: there were doctors from Dachau concentration camp who had killed prisoners by putting them through high altitude tests, who had frozen their victims and given them massive closes of salt water to research the process of drowning. There were the chemical weapons engineers such as Kurt Blome, who had tested Sarin nerve gas on prisoners at Auschwitz. There were doctors who had instigated battlefield traumas by taking women prisoners at Ravensbriick and filling their wounds with gangrene cultures, sa wdust, mustard gas, and glass, then sewing them up and treating some with doses of sulphur drugs while timing others to see how long it took for them to develop lethal cases of gangrene'. Cockburn and St Clair continued: 'Among the targets of the US Paperclip recruitment program were Hermann Becker-Freysing and Konr ad Schaeffer, authors of the study 'Thirst and Thirst Quenching in Emergency Situations at Sea'. The 'scientific' study was designed to devise ways to prolong the survival of pilots downed over water. To this end, the two scientists had asked Heinrich Himmler for \"forty healthy test subjects\" from the SS chief's network of concentration camps - the only debate among the scientists being whether the research victims should be Jews, gypsies or Communists. The experiments took place at Dachau. These prisoners, most of them Jews, had salt water forced down their throats through tubes. Others had salt water injected directly into their veins. Half of the subjects were given a drug called berkatit, which was supposed to make salt water more palatable, though both scientists suspected that the berkatit itself would prove fatally toxic within two weeks. They were absolutely correct. During the tests the doctors used long needles to extract liver tissue. No anaesthetic was give n. All the research subjects, of course, died. Both Becker-Freysing and Schaeffer received long-term contracts under Paperclip; Schaeffer ended up in Texas, where he continued his research into 'thirst and desalinisation of salt water.' Becker-Freysing was given the responsibility, the authors reported, 'of editing for the US Air Force the massive store of aviation res earch conducted by his fellow Nazis. By this time he had been tracked down and brought to trial at Nuremberg. The multi-volume work, entitled 'German Aviation Medicine : World War II', was eventually pub-"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"218 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler lished by the US Air Force, complete with an introduction written by Becker-Freysing from his Nuremberg jail cell. The wo rk neglected to mention the human victims of the research, and praised the Nazi scientists as sincere and honourable men 'with a free and academic character labouring under the constraints of the Third Reich'. One of their prominent colleagues was a certain Dr. Sigmund Rascher, also assigned to Dachau. In 1941 Rascher informed Himmler of the vital need to conduct high-altitude experiments on human subjects. Rascher, who had developed a special low-pressure chamber during his tenure at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, asked Himmler for permission to have delivered into his custody 'two or three hundred professional criminals', a Nazi euphemism for Jews, Russian prisoners, and members of the Polish unde rground resistance. Hi mmler quickly assented and Rascher's experiments were under way within a month. 'Rascher's victims were locked inside hi s low-pressure chamber, which simulated altitudes of up to 68,000 feet. Eighty of the human guinea pigs died after being kept inside for half an hour without oxygen. Dozens of others were dragged semi-conscious from the chamber and immediately drowned in vats of ice water. Rascher quickly sliced open their heads to examine how many blood vessels in the brain had burst due to air embolisms. Rascher filmed these experiments and the autopsies, sending the footage along with his meticulous notes back to Himmler. \"Some experiments gave men such pressure in their heads that they would go mad and pull out their hair in an effort to relieve such pressure\", Rascher wrote. \"They would tear at their heads and faces with their hands and scream in an effort to relieve pressure on their eardrums\". Rascher's records were scooped up by US intelligence agents and delivered to the Air Force'. That is how keen the relevant evil cadres of the US intelligence community were to obtain and build upon these hellish findings. The US intelligence operatives were in fact so entranced with their mission, that they went to extraordinary lengths to protect their recruits from criminal investigators at the US Department of Justice. One of the more despicable cases was that of Nazi aviation re searcher Emil Salmon, who, though a Jew, had helped during the War to set fire to a syna gogue filled with Jewish women and children. Salmon was sheltered by US officials at Wr ight Air Force Base in Ohio after being convicted of crimes by a denazification court in Germany. ENTER THE OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE Through its Technical Mission in Europe, the US Navy was also hot on the trail of state-of- the-art Nazi research into inte rrogation techniques. The Navy's intelligence officers soon came across Nazi research papers on truth serums , this research having been conducted, yet again, at Dachau concentration camp, by a Dr . Kurt Plotner. Plotner had given Jewish and Russian prisoners high doses of mescalin and had watched them display schizophrenic behaviour. The prisoners began to talk openly of their hatred of their German captors, and to make confessional statements about their psychological makeup. Reading Dr. Plotner's reports, the US Naval Intelligence officers discovered that Plotner had experimented with some success with mescalin as a speech- and even truth-inducing drug, enabling interrogators to extract 'even the most intimate secrets from the subject when questions were cleverly put'. Plotner al so reported researches into m escalin's potential as an agent of behavioural modification or mind-control. Cockburn and St Clair reported that 'this information was of particular interest to Boris Pash, one of the more sinister figures in the CIA cast of characters in this early phase. Pash was a Russian emigre to the United States who had gone through the rev-"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 219 olutionary years at the birth of the Soviet Union.... In his capacity as head of security Pash had supervised the OSS officer George Hunter White's use of THC on Manhattan Project scientists. In 1944 Pash was picked by Donovan to head up what was called the Alsos Mission, designed to scoop up German scientists who had been involved in atomic, chemical and biological weapons research. Mr Pash set up shop at the house of an old prewar friend, Dr. Eugene von Haagen, a prof essor at the University of Strasburg, where many Nazi scientists had been faculty members. Pash had met von Haagen when the doctor was on sabbatical at Rockefeller University in New York, researching tropical viruses. When von Haagen returned to Germany in the late 1930s he and Kurt Blome became joint heads of the Nazis' biological weapons unit'. 'Von Haagen', the authors reported, drawing on their study of official documents, 'spent much of the war infecting Jewish inmates at the Natzweiler concentration camp with diseases, including spotted fever. Undeterred by the wartime activities of his old friend, Pash immediately placed von Haagen into th e Paperclip Program, where he worked for the US Government for five years providing expertise in germ weapons research. Von Haagen put Pash in touch with his former colleague, Blome, who was also speedily enlisted in the Paperclip Program. There was an inconv enient hiatus when Blome was arrested and tried at Nuremberg for medical war crimes, including the deliberate infecting of hundreds of prisoners from the Polish underground with TB and bubonic plague. But fortunately for the Nazi man of 'science', US Army Intelligence and the OSS withheld mcriminating documents they had acquired through their interrogation. The evidence would not only have demonstrated Blome's guilt but also his supervising role in constructing a German CBW laboratory to test chemical and biologi cal weapons for use on Allied troops'. Blome was acquitted. One final excerpt from Cockburn and St Clair's analysis is relevant here. 'In 1954, two months after Blome's acquittal', they assert ed, 'US intelligence officers journeyed to Germany to interview him. In a memorandum to his superiors, Mr H. W Batchelor described the purpose of this pilgrimage' in the following terms - which will have warmed the cold hearts of the long-term strategic deception operatives of the Nazi International at the Madrid-based German Geopolitical Centre [see Chapter 8], who had been largely responsible for enticing the short-sighted Amer icans to embrace the Nazi intelligence and scientific communities, in pursuit of their long-range strategy of establishing the Nazis' Thousand-Year Reich on the ruins of the United States itself: \"We have friends in Germany, scientific fr iends, and this is an opportunity to enjoy meeting them to discuss our various problems\". At the session, Blome gave Batchelor a list of the biological weapons researchers who had worked for him during the War and discussed promising new avenues of research into weapons of mass destruction. The authors concluded that 'Blome was soon signed up to a new Paperclip contract for $6,000 a year, and flew to the United States, where he took up his duties at Camp King, an army base located outside Washington, DC. In 1951 von Haagen was picked up by the French authorities. Despite the tireless efforts of his protectors in US intelligence, the doctor was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to twenty years in prison'. Thus the 'received view' that US intelligence hastened to exfiltrate as many Nazi scientists and intelligence specialists as it could, in the context of the rivalry induced by the Cold War, is incorrect. On the contrary, US intelligence, aided and abetted by the British, lusted after these Nazis and their Satanic expertise from the get-go."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"220 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler ENDLESS INTELLIGENCE MACHINATIONS TO DESTABILISE SOCIETY In 1999, 'The Albany Times Union' reported th at the University of Albany had closed down research being conducted by Professor Kathryn Kelley, who had been examining the fears of people who claimed to have been surgically implanted with communications devices capable of reading their thoughts. Dr Kelley referred in writing to a massive implant research programme funded by the National Security Agency and the US Department of Defense, costi ng $2.0 billion. Exposure of this research by Dr Kelley herself and concerned graduate students, resulted in the Univer sity's announcement; but it was obvious that the project itself continued (and that, again, the work Dr Kelley was doing would also have continued). One graduate student, Gregory George, who reported that he was part of a team assigned to lay the factual foundations for implant research, was reported to have identified several fi rms that had developed 'trans-tympanic transducers' - instruments functioning like mini-telephones that send voice m essages to the inner ear. At a conference in Orlando, Florida, in the same month, Dr Kelley had explained how a subject might be implanted with such a device during anaesthesia, perhaps leaving tiny stitches visible in the ear. She referred to the devices as RAATs (short for radio wave, auditory, assaultive transmitting implants). Dr Kelley wrote in her paper that 'when (short- wave) operators transmit to or scan RAAT implants in victims, they can talk to the victims remotely and anonymous ly, and hear the victim's speech and thoughts'. Her paper must have annoyed her ultimate funders by pointing out that the National Institutes of Health routinely deny any Government role in such research - lying to the American public. In 1995, Ralph Tortorici, who claimed that the American Government had planted microchips in his body, held a class of 37 st udents hostage and shot one student during a struggle at the University of Albany. In 1999, the gunman hanged himself in his prison cell. In 1994, Advanced Neurotechnologies deve loped a brain-to-computer interface that can translate brainwaves into coded data. A mi crochip called, ominously but appropriately 'Soul Catcher 2025', that can be placed behi nd a human eye to record all visual and physical sensations as well as thought, is reportedly under development at Br itish Telecom's Martlesham Laboratories. The exte nt of British involvement in behaviour modification, mass mind-control and Psy-Ops is evident from the extensive list of US organisations with which a clear link to the Ta vistock Institute is or has been identified, following the transfer of the German Jew Kurt Lewi n to America in the 1930s. The direct involvement of Scottish Rite Freemasonry in behaviour modification, mind-control and personality manipulation r esearch and operations has already been alluded to. But how many people know that the murderers Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan were connected to the AMORC Rosicrucians, the Satanic sect which is embedded within Scottish Rite Freemasonry and whic h has published a secret document containing instructions on how to summon up the Devil himself? Manson's operating base was the Spahn Movie Ranch which was purchased after Manson's incarceration by the German Krupp Family - key figures involved in the armi ng of Hitler's Third Reich. Many of the Manson murder victims in Georgetown, Guyana, had been involved in Satanism and death rites. Congressman Leo Ryan, who had uncovered information linking the CIA to the creation of mind-control cults, went to Guyana to investigate. His appearance there reportedly triggered the suicides and murders. Dr Mootoo, a Guyanan pathologist who was the first to arrive at the Jamestown atroc ity scene, concluded that all but three of the 'suicide' victims had been murdered."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 221 'INVENTORS OF EVIL THINGS' AND MEDDLERS WITH SOULS In Paul's Epistle to the Romans, the perpetrators and promoters of such evils were precisely identified. The list, as we have seen, includ es a description of the Luciferians and their abominations who are exposed in this analysis, who have put God aside and presume to be in a position to reorder every dimension of human existence, including spirituality: hence, for instance, an organisation in the United States calling itself the Council on Spiritual Practices, which in fact investigates every psychoscientific aberration and occult 'spiritual' departure under the sun. Paul included, in his list of 'the lost', a category of 'abominable persons' which precisely fits the reprobate characters itemised here: 'inventors of evil things'. Among these is an offshoot of Scientology founded by one Robert DeGrimston called The Process, which specialises in 'returning' the mind to a blank state (tabula rasa) through violence. This is attempted during certain Masonic rites, when the candidate is picked up bodily and thrown about the Lodge and between participants, as shown here in the illustration from Captain Morgan's exposure of Freemasonry dated 1827 [Figure 41]. Figure 41: The caption to this illustration from Captai n William Morgan's exposure of US Freemas onry dated 1827, entitled 'Illustrations of Mas onry', reads as follows: 'Candidate as Hira m Abiff falling into the canvas, having been struck in the forehead by the setting maul of the s upposed third ruffian, Jubelum.

The three ruffians are thought to represent a blasphemous insult to the Holy Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. The ceremony in question is accompanied by much violence , as is confirmed by the following excerpts from Captain Morgan's account, citing the prescribed Lodge language: '[Seizing the c andidate by the throat... and jerking him about with violence].... The ruffian then gives the candidate a blow with the twenty-four-inch gauge across the throat, on which he fled to the West Gate [of the Temple], where he was accosted by the second ruffian, Jubelo, with more violence, and on his refusal to comply with this request, he gave him a severe blow with the square across his breast, on which he attempted to make his escape at the East Gate, where he was accosted by the third ruffian, Jubelum, with still more violence, and on refusing to comply with this request, the ruffian gave him a violent blow with the common gavel on his forehead, which brought him to the floor ...'. Thus the central ceremony of Blue Lodge Freemasonry is infested with violence, infesting Masons with a tolerance of violence as 'collateral damage'. This ritualised violence is also associated wit h an attempt to clear the candidate's mind by forcing him to ensure an ordeal after which nothing will ever be the same for him again.

The Pentagon claims that HAARP exists for ionospheric research purposes. The essence of the evil Tavistock method is the degenerate psychology which the German Tavistock operative Kurt Lewin called 'group dynamics', such as the method used by Moral re-Armament. In a Lewinite brainwashing session, individuals from varying backgrounds and with contrasting personalities are manipulated by a 'group leader' to form a 'consensus' of opinion, th ereby procuring a new 'group identity'. The key to this insidious process is the creation of a controlled environment in which stress is introduced (sometimes called dissonance), designe d to destabilise and crack an individual's belief structure. Using the peer pressure of other group members, the individual is 'cracked', and a new personality is supposed to emerge, equipped with new 'values'. The parallellism of this method with the Skull an d Bones and Masonic ritual of being 'born again' out of a state of death in a coffin, is no coincidence. The degrading experience causes the person to deny that any change ha s taken place - which means, in effect, that the victim has been brainwashed without being aware of what has occurred. This is in fact the same method, with some minor modifications, as that used in all so-called 'sensitivity groups' or 'T-groups', or in the context of the rock-sex counterculture which exists to make money while destroying the family, and in 'touchy-feely' format, as promoted by the Esalen Institute - which succeeded on one occasion in brainwashing over 500 Catholic nuns to leave the church and the teaching profession. It is also the method being used by 'Common Purpose', a sinister brainwashing operation run secretly by the UK Central Government from an office in Whitehall. 'Group dynamics' are deployed on a large scale by one of the leading US 'Tavistock School' entities, National Training Laborator ies (NIL), which was established in 1947 by members of the US Tavistock network and located originally on an estate at Bethel, Maine. The specific objective of NTL's remit was the brainwashing of government officials, educational institutions and corporate bureaucracies in Tavistock's 'methodology', so that such brainwashed 'leaders' could then be used either to run Tavistock 'group dynamics' sessions themselves, to to hire other similarly trained groupies to do the job. From the mid-1950s onwards, National Training Laboratories (NIL) put most of the United States' corporate leaderships th rough mass brainwashing programmes,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 223 while running similar programmes for the State Department, the Navy, the Department of Education, and other components of the US Fe deral bureaucracy. It is believed that several million such officials and servants of the state have been 'deconstructed and rebuilf by the National Training Laboratories, now called th e NTL Institute for Applied Behavioural Sciences, based at Rosslyn, Virginia. This organisation's West Coast base is Western Training Laboratories in Group Development, and there are various satellite organisations. One of NTL's biggest cus- tomers since the 1950s has been the National Education Association, which is the largest organisation of teachers in the United States. In 1964, the NTL became a direct component of the National Education Association, establishing 'group sessions' in all of its branches and affiliates. Whenever you hear of 'group sessions' taking place, be sure that what is happening is a form of brainwashing originally propounded and developed by the Tavistock Institute and its manic affiliates, lo ci of the 'seething energies' of Lucifer. With funding from the US Department of Education, the NTL Institute designed all the programmes for the training of US primary and secondary school teachers, and has had a hand in the development of the most insidious of prevailing and ongoing 'educational reforms', including Outcome-Based Education, sex education and 'death education'. The Tavistock-related NTL Institute for Applied Behavioural Sciences is a brainwashing centre specialising in artificial stress training, in which participants suddenly find themselves immersed in having to defend themselves against vicious accusations, familiar from our earlier look at Scientology's similarly odious abominations. The Tavistock Institute's known network extends from the far-left University of Sussex, to the Hudson Institute, founded by the German Jew Hermann Kahn in 1961. As indicated, Khan also founded the CIA's most prominent related agitprop think-tank, the RAND Corporation. Other related organisati ons (already listed) include the Heritage Foundation (founded by Paul Weyrich with funding from Joseph Coors, a beer magnate), the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown (which trains US State Department personnel), US Air Force Intelligence, and the CIA's Mitre Corporation. A network of secret New Underworld Order groups such as the DVD front, the Trilateral Commission, the Ditchley Foundation, the Mont Pelerin Society and the Club of Rome (which 'educates' us all on the need for population reduction, which it plots) provides a complex conduit for New Underworld Order Luciferian instructions to the Tavistock organisations in the United States. The US branch of the Ditchley Foundation has been run by Cyrus Vance, the former US Secretary of State, and Director of the Rockefeller Foundation, and by Winston Lord, President of the Council on Foreign Relations. The wife of Winston Lord, a Bonesman, was the Chairwoman of the Board of Freedom House, a misnamed publishing house. It is a Council on Foreign Relations front which is allegedly involved, inter alia, in the manipulation of the 'Christian Righf which has been heavily targeted by the CIA over the years. One of the most odious of alleged American Nazis was Senator Robert C. Byrd, who 'justified' mind-control activities as a me ans of thrusting mankind into accelerated revolution, in conformity with neo-Nazi principles. Mankind's spiritual needs must be manipulated in order to bring about 'world p eace' through what Byrd considered 'the only means available - total mind-control unde r the New World Order'. Mark Phillips' deprogrammed sex slave Cathy O'Brien reports that Byrd 'believed in the Nazi and KKK principles of \"annihilation of underprivileged races and cultures\" through genocide' - to breed 'the more gifted - the blondes of this world' [see panel, page 251]."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"224 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler BACK TO MARK PHILLIPS, D.I.A. PS Y-OPS 'DEPROGRAMMER' - PHOTOGRAPHER With this background in mind, we can now revert to some considerations about Trance Formation of America, the atrocious Psy-Ops book by Mark Phillips and the MONARCH slave he says he has deprogrammed, Cathy O'Brien. Mr Phillips' full name is Marquart (Mark) Ewing Phillips, who was born on 17th May 1943 in Nashville, Tennessee. In the introduction to the book (which contains evidence of degradation, depravity, sexual indulgence and drug-crazed behaviour among holders of high office associated with psyche manipulation and criminal activity protected under the guise of security spanning many US Administrations, that is far more disturbing than the already alarming enough details published so far in this work), Mr Phillips writes as follows: 'This brief and highly condensed contribu tion is intended to provide an under- standing of why, when, and where I embarked on a study of the most secret technology known to man: Trauma-based mind-control' which has evolved from experiments being conducted by Heinrich Himmler's Satanised scientists. 'Through the publication of declassified United States Government documents, our US Department of Defense (DOD) admits that this ancient wizard's mechanism for control is so dangerous that most information pertaining to it must remain classified as TOP SECRET. As the employee of a DOD subcontractor with exposure to mind-control research, I was required to sign an oath of secrecy. To this day I am restricted by law from revealing certain specific information that directly pertained to my employment as, among other \"sensitive\" exposures, a US DOD subcontractor in mind-control research'. Phillips adds: T was able to liberate MK-ULTRA victims, Cathy O'Brien and her daughter, Kelly, from the invisible grip of this US Government secret weapon of control'. The book records what Mr Phillips says is th e story of the rehabilitation of the MONARCH sex slave Ms. Cathy O'Brien and her da ughter, Kelly - although Cathy O'Brien's reported attempts to obtain rehabilitation rights for her daughter Kelly have been repeatedly blocked on 'grounds of national security'; and in the process, an enormous amount of disgusting, disreputable, reprob ate and frankly repulsively compromising material about top US offi cials and leaders, past a nd present, is recorded. A sequel to 'Trance Formation of America', en titled 'Mind Kontrol - The Proof', dealing with MK-ULTRA, MK-DELTA (chemical and biological warfare) ARTICHOKE., BLUEBIRD, LSD, Psylocybin, hypnosis, interrogation techniques and other control methodologies used by the US Government, and allegedly based on 17,000 images obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and well over 34,000 files, has since been published by O'Brien-Phillips, who also have a video for sale entitled 'mind-control Out of Control', and have made a business out of their revelations (that is to say, of revelations by Cathy O'Brien), which reveal how successful Mark Ph illips has been in deprogramming Cathy. Indeed, one of the purposes of this book is to illustrate, perhap s by design, that it is possible to rehabilitate pre-programmed and abused MONARCH sex slaves. The other main purpose may be to signal that the authorities' retention of Cathy's programmed daughter is a scandal, like everything else in this Luciferian cesspit of evil. The book also serves the purpose of adding greatly to the openly available detail about extreme degradation and corruption in high places, which, as the intelli gence services know, not least from Hitler's experience during the Second World War, the vast majority of the population won't want to believe, or will be all the more confused by. This Author is accustomed to teasing out truth from falsehood in copy prepared by Soviet intelligence, and it is his opinion that if Phillips' document represented an ele-"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 225 merit of a Soviet discrediting offensive, it would contain certain tell-tale language and idiomatic traits too inconsequential (to the reader) to review here. This is not a Soviet discrediting work, although following the 'Period of Escalating Violence', as laid down in the Comintern's 'Blueprint for World Revolution' [1928], the next stage is indeed a concerted operation to discredit the leaderships of 'enemies of the Revolution'. Motivated by the necessity to establish whether the 'photographer' called Mark Phillips who took the 9/11 picture(s) of the Devil in the smoke is the same person who ghosted/co-authored Cathy O'Brien's 1995 deta iled expose of the application of trauma- based mind-control programmes in the interests of strategy, the Author wrote to Ms O'Brien, in the spirit of O'Brien-Phillips' requests for input, implied by their website. The letter asked whether Ms O'Brien represented a 'd eprogramming case study', implying a scintilla of doubt as to whether the pair's representation that 'Cathy Phillips', as she now is, is indeed a survivor of Project MONARCH'S (MK-ULTRA) mind-control programme, and that Mark Phillips is the person ('former ' intelligence operative) who rescued her, represents the full story. The Author received no reply to his letter, which is more or less to be expected if the addressee is an intelligence operative. The letter asked whether Mark Phillips is the same Mark Phillips who 'took' the Devil-in-the-smoke photographs. Since there was no reply to this question, the Author has concluded that the two Phillips are indeed the same. In which case, it is evident (as is almost always the case when one fol- lows such a line of reasoning) that the operative in question is NOT a 'for- mer' Psy-Ops' operative, but remains engaged in this line of esoteric activity, and was responsible for distributing some of the the hnage(s) of the Devil in the smoke. While it was a Psy-Ops operation, it is also likely that, since the destruction of the Twin Towers was a Fire Ritual Sacrifice, the Devil or demon images were real: they did not need to be faked. This would explain how it was possible for the Devil-in- the-smoke image to be delivered to Associated Press within 14 minutes of extreme pressure and drama. The intelligence agent here seems to be more than simply a 'former' CIA 'Psy-Ops' expert, but rather may be a fully paid-up Tsy-Ops' operative. In a rational environment, such a discovery would perhaps throw into question the entire grim contents of 'Trance Formation of America' and its reports of high-level participation in degrading behaviour modification (brainwashing) or mind Figure 42: 'Trance Formation of America' by Cathy O'Brien, which exposes, in enormous detail, the sex-based mind- control manipulation operations of the llluminati at the highest Black levels of Government in North America. The lurid content is so detailed t hat it cannot be fiction."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"226 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler control operations contained therein - consider ing that the phrase Project MONARCH is not mentioned in any open intelligence document s, and that Ms. O'Brien apparently cannot remember any dates or Air Force Laboratory layouts that could be verified by an objective researcher seeking to check her facts. This lack of information forces at least one observer to conclude that the entire package of material the Phillipses have published could have been compiled from already published accounts. ARE THEY 'LICENSED' TO PUBLISH SUCH COMPROMISING MATERIAL? Furthermore, Mr and Mrs Phillips have con tinued with apparent impunity to publish material, in the United States, that remains in the public domain, which condemns holders of the highest offices as the most foul and cont emptible of human beings, accompanied by exhaustive detail including dates, locations and details of who else was present at given sexual abuse abominations. To be able to publish such extremely damaging information - about Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford (a.k.a. Leslie Lynch King), about Richard Cheney's alleged sexual brutality and involvement in high-voltage tortures, or the handing of $2.5 million of pornography profits to a MONARCH slave for crediting with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B CCI), about the joint participation of the Jesuits and the CIA in torture just before deat h in the course of Nazi-style Death's Door Programming in PROJECT MONARCH (the intern ationally recognised cryptic codename for which is 'Freedom Train'), about Bill Be nnett, the so-called Drug Czar and Bill Clinton at the Bohemian Grove, about the alleged evil of Senator Robert Byrd and the facility with which Bill Clinton had mastered mind-control access to MONARCH sex slaves - implies that such 'releases' of information are 'sanctioned' and therefore controlled. It is not unknown for horrendous atrocities (for instance, such as those perpetrated at Abu Ghraib) to be 'surfaced' from the intelligence world, as a means of masking the emergence of even more compromising material. Another possibility is that public reaction to such disclosures is monitored, to gauge how 'successful' mass desensitising operations have been. Further, since it is appa rent that Mark Phillips was responsible for the Associated Press 'Devil-in-the-smoke' frame(s), one cannot be certain that these Satanic Psy- Ops revelations of his are not themselves a component of a broader, ongoing 'Psy-Ops' programme. Psychological Operations perp etrated against the American people by structures of their own Government have escalated by an order of magnitude in recent years, as the Luciferians imagine that they are approaching the realisation of their mad plans to reorganise humanity and the whole world. The Devil-in-the-smoke image was replicated , as shown in Figure 3 on page 11, by a Devil or demon image seen amid the flam es, which was broadcast by CNN. The Author is therefore certain, given all the circumstances and the known facts, and recalling that former Satanists recognised the Devil-in-the-smoke figure as identical to devils conjured during Satanic Fire Ritu als, that the images were genuine, not fakes, and that, as an experienced Psy-Ops manipulator and CIA mind- control expert and therefore a de facto occultist, Mark Phillips would not have been surpri sed that the Fire Ritual of the Twin Towers duly conjured up fire demons, as provided for in the magical invocation procedures of the 'Ancient Mysteries' to which these Illuminati adhere, aspire to, and which they seek to universalise. As for the gross publicity that the Phi llipses' have given to the absolutely unspeakable evils described in their book, they themselves suggest that colleagues had informed them that no-one would believe what they have revealed, unless they had been liquidated. They have not been murdered, as far as is known."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 227 Finally, as Goebbels, Himmler and Hitler discovered, the perpetration of unspeakable acts on a mass scale, or on any scale, sounds so gross and unlikely as to be unbelievable. Those who know the truth are afraid, at the very least, of being made to look foolish by retailing it: so they shut up. Exactly the same syndrome is evident today: if some of the information collected from the public domain by observers such as this Author were to appear in the 'mainstream' press - although this may change - the general supposition has been that it would not be believed. But when millions of Americans are 'disappeared' and squeezed into specially equipped railcars, standing room only, and are forced to hold onto straps while the trains run the length of the United States, up into Alaska and through the Bering Strait tunnel into the 'former' USSR, where they will be disposed of and never heard of again, the Author and those who know about these abominations, if still alive, will perhaps look less foolish than some would like to make them look today. Mrs Phillips writes, of the second book, that 'much of the information enclosed herein has been corroborated and validated through brave and co urageous 'clean' members of the law enforcement, scientific and intelligence communities familiar with this (i.e. her own) ca se. These individuals' efforts helped me to understand and corroborate what happened after a lifetime of systematic physical and psychological tort ure orchestrated to modify my behaviour through totally controlling my mind. Some of these courageous individuals are employed by the very system that controlled me, and live in fear of losing their jobs, their families, or their lives. They have gone as far as they dare towards publicly exposing this tool of engineers of the New World Order - to no avail. This book is a grassroots effort to solicit and enlist the public and private support of human rights advocates, the recognized, respected doors in America to expose this invisible and social menace...'. 'The expertise of my primary advocate and skilled deprogrammer' - which means that Mr Phillips of course learned his deprogramming skills from the same secret sources that teach the Satanic programming skills in the first place, as she now admitted - 'developed though his US Defense Department knowledge of 'Top Secret' mind-control research and researchers, was responsible for the restoration of my mind to normal functioning. As a result, I have recovered memories related to this text, and, having survived the ordeal, have reached this point of enormous frustration' - by which she must have meant that she earnestly seeks to persuade Americans somehow to demand that these Satanic practices conducted by the authorities must cease. If that is true, why did she or Mr Phillips not answer the Author's letter, as the Author is being of assistance here? 'In 1988, through a series of br illiantly orchestrated events, Mark Phillips rescued me and my 8-year-old daughter, Kelly, from our mind-controlled existence and took us to the safety of Alaska for rehabilitation. It wa s there that we began the tedious process of untangling my amnesic mind to consciously recall what I was supposed to forget'. 'Many US and foreign government secrets and personal reputations were staked in the belief that I could not be deprogrammed and re habilitated to accurately reveal the criminal covert activities and perversions in which Kelly and I were were forced to participate, particularly during the Reagan/Bush Administrations. Now that I have gained control of my own mind, I view it as my duty as a mother and American patriot to exercise my gained free will to expose the mind-control atrocities th at my daughter and I endured at the hands of those in control of our government. This personal view of Inside Pandora's Box includes a keen perception of how mind-control is being used to apparently implement the New World Order, and a personal knowledge of WHO..."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"228 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler of the so-called \"masterminds\" are behind this world and mind dominance' programme. All of which sounds highly commendable; indeed, as indicated, the Author was so impressed that he wrote, as indicated, to Ms O' Brien, at the publicised address, indicating inter alia his intention of elaborating upon this issue (in this book). No response. mind-control and personality modification oper ations are among the myriad evil tools being deployed to leverage the world towards One World G overnment. Colossal financial resources have been corralled for that purpo se. Other methodologies include mass Psy-Ops, terrorism, the global distribution of pornography and biowarfare byproducts in the form of generic pharmaceuticals via the Internet, the degr adation of entertainmen t, the hijacking of sport and 'spectacles' for global propaganda pur poses, the exploitation of environmental issues, innumerable scams and financial an d commodity warfare operations, military operations conducted by proxy, dialectical scen e-setting (creation of Th esis and Antithesis), the liberal misuse of the legal process, false w itness, and assassinations - to name only some of the more widely used 'chaos'-making mechanisms. IMPLICATIONS OF THE FAILURE TO REPLY TO THE AUTHOR'S LETTER Because the Author received no reply to his le tter, and also because Trance Formation of America was published in Las Vegas - wher e the intelligence community creates prop- aganda and disinformation films and videos, so why not printed material as well? - he has had to conclude that the availability of Cathy O'Brien's material in the public domain, and the fact that she and Mark Phillips appear to be able to continue publishing this material with impunity, must suit the perpet rators of these atrocities. As in the covert Leninist Soviet Union, the existence of 'controlled opposition' (controlled dialectical Antithesis) provides the Thesis with 'credi bility'. But that, of course, implies that Mr Phillips is quite content with this state of affairs, especially as he may continue, apparently, to be engaged in Psy-Ops operations (at least, as at 9/11). So here we have (a) intelligence operat ive(s) publicly rebelling against the abom- inations demanded of them by their superiors; (b) remaining alive despite revealing state secrets and detailed descripti ons, which could not possibly be invented, of the debauched and reprobate behaviour of past and present holders of the highest offices in the United States, complete with code names, and other details which could only be obtained from inside knowledge; and (c) perhaps continuing to work for the very perpetrators of atrocities whom they condemn in the open exposure material. Is this all done to maximise confusion; do es it reflect extreme continuing antagonisms and divisions inside the intelligence services (about which there is much separate evidence); or is the publication of these titles itself a comp onent of the endless cycle of cynical Psy-Ops operations in which the reprobate US intelligen ce services are perpetually engaged? Or is it that these intelligence operatives suffer from the consequences of having had their personalities split themselves, a nd are kind of bipolar - agreeing with all sides of every question while they continue working for the Satanised ogres who employ them? As has been mentioned, the Phillips' were themselv es informed that no-one would believe what they had published unless they themselves were liquidated, which has not happened - the implication being that 'no-one believes this st uff'. But the Nazis discovered that crimes of Satanic ruthlessness and intensity, organised on a production-line basis, can be largely (but not completely) hidden from view, even th ough large numbers of Germans had to be involved in their admini stration - simply because the sane mind, to retain its integrity, rejects what it rightly co nsiders to be abhorrent."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 229 BASED ON THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD' Whatever the correct answer to such questions, if their ar e any, given this world of induced Satanic chaos, Mr Phillips has submitted to at least one interview in which he tried to explain the broader context of US offici al mind-control operations, and correctly traced the outline history of this Satanic cluster of programmes to the Nazis. In the excerpts that follow, Mark Phillips also co nfirmed an assessment reach ed separately from public- domain information by this Author - namely, that the Second World War, including the Illuminati-contrived dialectical struggle between National Socialism and International Socialism (Communism), never ended: it just shifted across the Atlantic. Since the Bush- Cheney intelligence cadre disp lays continuity with the Himmler-Nazi tradition of pre- emptive attack, and the Clinton-Kerry-Gore cadre with the Communist 'line', while the Bushes, Dick Cheney, Bill C linton and John Kerry are each and every one of them intelligence operatives, it follows that the Second World War has been continuing within the US intelligence community w ithout ceasing. This would be entirely consistent with documented proof that the Nazi International strategists intended to continue the war until the Thousand-Year Reich has been established in Washington, DC. Mark Phillips was interviewed by 'Guerrilla News Network' (date uncertain) which, despite its revolutionary name, is a serious website; and the fact that it was through this medium that Mr Phillips provided serious, if cynical and at times complacent, answers to important questions, does not detract from the need for Mr Phillips' remarks to be given serious consideration: Q: Define the term 'Psychological Warfare' (Psy-Ops). A: 'Psychological warfare is nothing more than a series of well-planned and well-executed, invisible programmes all working in tandem - none of them knowing what the others are doing - to manipulate the minds of our enemies or our adversaries into believing something quite different from reality. So they are misled and we in turn win the war that's actually never been fought on a battlefield'. Notice that Mark Phillips does not define who 'our enemies or our adversaries' are, that are being lied to (which is what his elabor ate answer meant: they are being lied to). He omitted to say that 'our enemies or our adversaries' could be (in this context) the American people, or selected components of it - those who do not, for instance, go along with the undermining, collectivisation or loss of national sovereignty inherent in the conspiracy to establish the New Underworld Order, or who do not accept the validity of innumerable official programmes, including compulsory vaccination, the substitution of mind-bending and propaganda for education, and the mandatory application of revolutionary 'politically correct' 'solutions' in the workplace. By this very omission, this obviously highly skilled ongoing Psy-Ops intelligence expert all but revealed that it is leg itimate for such techniques to be used against the domestic population, whose prim itive expectations must be 'modified' to conform with the authorities' preferences. Q: Explain the origins of mind-control. A: mind-control research has been around si nce 'The Egyptian Book of the Dead' was recorded. You can see the entire formula for trauma-based mind-control right there in 'The Egyptian Book of the Dead'. It has escalated from there through various religions, or cults as they are called, for thousands of years. And as a result of that, H itler gave Himmler a charge to research the multi-generationally incest-abusin g families of Northern Europeans. Because Himmler had found out that these people had incredible, what H itler termed, 'super-human' traits as a result of this mind-control."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"230 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler Before we go any further, let us recall the de eper relevance of all this. In Scripture, the term 'Egypt' is synonymous with 'the Darkness' (no offence to modern Egypt being intended here), since the children of Israel were led by the Lord 'out of the darkness into the light' in a real-time and real-life metaphor for the challe nge that faces all of us. Our natural tendency is to descend towards the darkness, which is why Lucifer is having such a ball 'as we speak' - as the Illuminati offensive against Tr ue Christianity, which they seek (in vain) to extinguish, appears to have gained the upper hand. Phillips' res ponse confirms that the CIA, taking its cue from Himmler and the Tavistock Institute, 'leverages' the 'darkness' of the 'Ancient Mysteries' for geopolitical purposes. In short, here we have further proof - this time, from an expert horse's mouth - that the US Government's black intelligence services have been investigating the occult, the 'Works of Darkness' away from whic h the Lord led the Israelites 16 . The panel on page 231 confirms that this is indeed the CIA's objective. The whole point of Exodus is that the children of Israel were being removed from Egypt - universally recognised to be the Biblical metaphor for Darkness - and led towards the Land of Milk and Honey (a living metaphor for the True Light). Exodus and the history of the transfer of the people of Israel from Egypt to Canaan is a 'living parable', showing how the Lord leads us from the darkness in which, through sin, we have languished, into His glorious light of Truth. By dabbling in these 'Ancient Mysteries', occult works of sorcery and darkness, the US intelligence services, which control the Federal Government, have magnified the Illum-inati's intended transference and universalisation of that darkness into the contemporary world, where it is in the process of being re-magnified in conflict with the Light - which these evil, misguided and demented people call the darkness, just as they call the darkness (of Lucifer) the light. Moreover there is separate evidence (from the RAND Corporation, the US intelligence 'think-tank' established by the German Jew, Hermann Kahn that the US Government's reprobate intention is indeed to 'bring the whole world back to Egypt' (the Darkness); for, as indicated earlier, these people, who are NOT atheists, all know that they are heading straight for the pit. The lust for 'Egypt, the Prize' expressed in the document summarised in the panel opposite, provides documented proof of this statem ent. Reverting now to Phillips' interview: Q: Give us a little history lesson. As World War II was ending, the Nazis had done a lot of research (along these lines). How did the Allies feel about these people and their research? A: What the United States was concerned about was that thes e Nazis [Himmler's occultic research scient ists and operatives - Ed].... had all this information and data, but we couldn't seem to prosecute them. Because they had already, a lot of them, scattered out to various countries like Russia, Italy and South America [sic]. So what the CIA persuaded Congress to do [was] to pass this Project Pa perclip [sic], as a legal means of importing these people into the United States and introducing them into our military industrial complex, including our colleges and universities. Their view was this: If we don't bring these people into our country and contain them, then our enemies, the Soviet Union, will get them. In other words, the Nazis didn't lose the war; they just had to move. So Hitler's Thousand Year Reich' boast was less foolish than we once thought. And it is clear from our study [in Chapter 8] of the operations of the Nazi International, established by the German Abwehr as the German Geopolitical Centre in Madrid in 1942 (but planned several years earlier), that the super-secret Nazi (Reinhard Gehlen) 'Black intelligence service DVD', based in Dachau, has been at war with us ever since."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 231 THE ILLUMINATI IN THEIR OWN MAD WORDS: THE RAND CORPORATION LOOKS FORWARD TO THE DARKNESS: 'EGYPT IS THE PRIZE' The CIA-linked RAND Corporation presented a talk to the US Defense Policy Board on 10th July 2002, accompanied by 24 slides. It contained inter alia the following slogans, which will doubtless seem very odd to anyone who has visited modern Dubai: • The Arab world has been in a systemic crisis for the last 200 years. • It missed out on the Industrial revolution. It is missing out on the digital revolution. • It lacks inner resources to cope with the modern world. • Its self-esteem is shattered.

This culture of violence is the prime enabler of terrorism. • Terror as an accepted, legitimate means of carrying out politics goes back 30 years. • 9/11 was a 'symptom' of the crisis spilling out of the region. [Nonsense: It was DVD]. • The paroxysm is liable to last for several decades. • The US response will decisively influence the duration and outcome. • Once upon a time., there was a partnership between America and Saudi Arabia. • Since 1745, 58% of all rulers of the House of Saud have meant a violent death. • Wahabism loathes modernity, capitalism, human rights, republics, democracy, religious freedom, an open society, and practices the opposite. • Saudis under Prince Abdullah launch a putsch within Sunni Islam, shifting from a pragmatic policy to promoting radical Islam. • Saudi Arabia is central to the self-destruction of the Arab world and the chief vector of the Arab crisis and outwardly-directed aggression. • The Saudis are active at every level of the terror chain, from planners to financiers, from cadre to foot-soldier, from ideologist to cheer-leader. • There is a daily outpouring of virulent hatred for the United States from the Saudi media. • Dismantle and ban all the Kingdom's 'Islamic charities' and confiscate their assets. • The Saudis are hated throughout the Arab world: lazy, overbearing, dishonest, corrupt. • Iraq is the tactical pivot. • Saudi Arabia the strategic pivot. • EGYPT THE PRIZE.. The final point, EGYPT THE PRIZE, reveals the true purpose of this extraordinary outburst of RAND invective. Egypt has relatively little oil. But it is the Biblical Land of Darkness, the original source of 'The Egyptian Book of the Dead', on which the CIA's Himmlerian occultic investigations, experimentation and MK-ULTRA-type abominations are openly acknowledged to be modelled. The Pharaohs tried in vain to prolong life by focusing their misguided and ignorant religious attention on the dead.

Q: What were the basic mechanics of Project Paperclip? A: Project Paperclip was nothing more than a transport operation. The airline that I worked for, Capital International Airways (i.e. CIA, which later handled drugs - Ed.) was a large contributor to this. Every airline that I know of in the United States was used, whether they knew it or not. But Capital, alon g with a couple of other carriers, were the primaries. Capital was actually put into business in 1947 because of Project Paperclip. And it was just the transportation of moving these people and their families around the world, wherever they wanted to go. But mainly, the first wave, was to bring these scientists. There were 700-odd scientists that were pro pulsion scientists and some 600-odd who were not propulsion scientists; they were psychiatrists. Or mind sciences people. I wouldn't distinguish them by calling them psychiatrists. Q: So when they got here, what were some of the duties that these Project Paperclip scientists had to work on? A: Werner von Braun was put in charge of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop what Hitler had already developed, the V2 rocket, into something that could carry people or individuals into outer space. Q: Was this propulsion research linked to mind-control? A: We're talking about two separate sciences here, mind-control and propulsion science. Both of them were part of the Hitler war machine. Some of these people were dedicated Nazis. Some of them were Jewish [so that Hitler had continued using Jewish scientists, who betrayed people of their own ethnic background, and whose continued presence in the Nazi structures reveals that the sacrifice of millions of Jews, gypsies and others, was a witchcraft sacrifice masked by an official policy - Ed.]. Some of them were Gentiles. Some of them were Austrian. It was a whole cross-section of people. These were just people. But they we re involved in some of the hi ghest technologies known at that time, which included propulsion sciences and mind-control. Q: So when did the CIA pick upon mind-control and where did it go from there? A: Well the 'CIA' was actually working on it in the 1920s. But there was no CIA in the 1920s. So it was really being done in private laboratories and quite openly, and by 1931 there were a couple of articles that actually hi t the national papers like Dr Skinner's work and him putting his daughter in what was known as the 'Skinner Box'. And, of course, we have photographs of that. The CIA's interest in it became piqued [sic] when, after World War II, they found that more research had been done by Hitler on mind-control of not only the masses, but of individuals too. More research was dedicated to that than even to the rockets. And as a matter of fact, Werner von Braun commented to a reporter [on one occasion] that if the money had been spent on rockets and not diluted in some of these other areas, they would probably have won the war. Q: So Hitler was hugely interested in mind-control. A: [Paraphrase]: He was. Hitler didn't be lieve that a nuclear holocaust was the answer to how to win the war. He did not believe in nuclear weapons [sic]. The V2 rocket was even outfitted with whistles so that it would begin to terrorize the targeted pop-"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 233 illation. It was a psychological warfare weapon combined with an ordnance delivery system that had never been seen before on the planet. So he was overwhelming Northern Europe, particularly Great Britain, with these ro ckets, as a psychological thing, more than because of any sort of damage they could do.... Breaking off here, the Author was brought up partly in London, and remembers the months when we were being bombarded by V2 ro ckets. It is true that once the engine had switched itself off, there was an eerie silence, followed by a sharp whistling sound before the explosion. The eerie silence was by far the worst part. Mark Phillips did not experience this terror, and his comment playing down the physical damage inflicted by V2 rockets is make-believe. In Winnington Road, London N2, where we once lived, most of the houses in the road were empty burned-out shells. The Author and his brother sometimes played around the wrecks of these burnt-out houses. It was a matter of pride to remain in a house which had not been destroyed. The interview proceeded: A: [Continued]: The mind-control aspect of it was a hidden science that Hitler [cherished] steeped in mysticism [Author: i.e., the occult]. He had sent a whole troupe of his scientists all the way to Tibet to discover what [the Tibetans] knew with regard to mind- control.... We've got the videos and the tapes of that trek, sending these [German] scientists up the side of these mountains in Mongolia [sic! Is Phillips' geographical knowledge faulty?]. I mean, this is major stuff - that he would stop right in the middle of the war to send valuable scientists into such an extraordinary environment. Q: [Paraphrase]: What is the status of mind-control research in the United States? A: mind-control research in this country for war purposes, psychological warfare purposes, started out really for the military, and for espionage. So around 1952, the CIA's reporter over in Korea released the term 'brainwashing' to introduce the whole idea and concept to the American people th at there was something else in the arsenal of weaponry of the Chinese. Q: What is it about the mind sciences that make them so appealing to groups who want to dominate and control other people? [A loaded question - Ed.]. A: All wars are won in the minds of the people, not on the battlefield. I believe this is the basis for the United States, as well as fo r other Governments that are actively engaged in mind-control research and applica tions. In fact, that's their belief. Q: What was the thinking behind the CIA's initial desire to create MK-ULTRA? A: I believe that the thinking of the OSS at that time, and the OSI, of course, that became the CIA.... the CIA was given the respon sibility for actually placing individuals out of Project Paperclip, these Nazi and Fascist sc ientists dealing with the mind-control sciences, into the military-industrial complex for further development of this secret technology that Adolf Hitler regarded as the world's most dange rous and absolutely the best war tool that anyone could have for taking over the planet [sic]. Q: What was it called? A: The name for the mind-control research [project] established in this country was MK-ULTRA, and the earliest that we know about [it] through Freedom of Information documents is 1952. Q: Is that the only name for mind-control operations in the United States? A: MK-ULTRA evolved actually [from] Project BLUEBIRD, the first project to spin, and that was in 1947. Actually some people say it was in 1949, but documents prove it was in 1947 [sic]. So it started immediately upon these Nazi scientists being brought into"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"234 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler this country. They immediately dovetail[ed] into Project BLUEBIRD and then it went to MK-ULTRA and then [to] MK-SEARCH. I mean, it's changed its names so many times that nobody knows what it's called now [in short, this Satanic activity continues - Ed.]. Q: Who were the first subjects exposed to MK-ULTRA? A: The first subjects that the CIA was intere sted in were people who were coming out of the battlefield and people who had actually been exposed to primitive forms of brainwashing by the Russians as well as the Chinese, Japanese, and, from my knowledge, then in Korea, of course. In 1952, it w as announced by a CIA news person who was reporting from the front that we had soldiers coming back who were saying what great people and what a great country North Korea wa s. And that was just unheard of at that time.... Q: Who were their next targets? A: Well, I believe that the next targets were people that were incarcerated within penitentiaries and mental in stitutions, as proven by Dr Ewen Cameron's research. Intervention by the Author He is awar e of one case of telephonic mind-control research intervention by US op eratives in the Un ited Kingdom between the years 1985 and 1988, in the context of a dispute between brothers concerning the will of their late mother, who had instructed solicitors on her death bed to exercise her Power of Appointment under an old family trust in favour of the brothers' sister, who was in need of income for her lifetime because of a disability. The intervention, which was accompanied by a physical break-in, involved attempts to ma nipulate the mind of the brother who had facilitated the visit of the solicitors, as a result of which the other brothers t hought that they had been depriv ed of their inheritance. Among eccentric e xogenous interventions, which included scams such as the familiar device of faxed 'confirmations of order' for a very large delivery of coffee beans, and advance delivery advices for goods or services never ordered, were repeated garbled messages left on an office answering machine. In those days, such machines usually had an LED display showing how many messages were retained in the memory. In the evening repe ated instances of the same garbled message, would cause the LED display to reach 40 or 50 messages. When the matter was reported to the telecommunications authorities and law enforcement, after 2,200 such messages, the source of the problem was finally, allegedly, traced to a teenage Sri Lankan living in his parents' home in South London. After a period of several months free from this intervention, the entire syndrome started up again On the second occasion, Scotland Yard became involved, the trouble was traced to the same source, and the intervention ceased. The Author is of course referring to his own personal experience. It was at the end of this ep isode, which coincided wi th the break-in, that the charming Scotland Yard detective on the case told the Author: 'Mr Story, all I can tell you is that it wasn't us'. The garbled voice used a phrase making use of the two generic words in the Author's serials publishing company, World Reports [Limited]. It is quite probable that the story about the mentally defective Sri Lankan was invented in order to provide the Author with an explanation for the failure of the operation. When a CIA operative calling himself Carl Story telephoned the Author in June 2003 and alluded to having been aware of the Author and his work 15 years earlier, the Author was able to connect some of the dots. It would be interesting to know what lessons the reprobate MK-ULTRA-type mind-control freaks thought they had learned from this exercise, which inflicted much gratuitous pain, suffering and anxiety on th e Author and his family. When the Author"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 235 related this story (which has been severely condensed in the foregoing summary) to a certain US MK-ULTRA victim in the Washington DC area in the late 1990s - a victim, who has managed to pull himself out of the mental pit into which the CIA's evil manipulations had deposited him - he laughed and said 'Welcome to MK-ULTRA'. [Mark Phillips' interview now continues]: Q: And how did the Government us e the law to protect themselves? A: In 1947, after the President of the United States told the Pentagon and the US Congress that he'd made a mistake signing this Project Paperclip into law, there was of course an exemption in the Project Paperclip legislation which stated that 'no person who belonged to the Nazi Party could be brought into this country' - which just about eliminated everybody they could have brought in on Project Paperclip. [This is not quite the full story: see below - Ed.]. So, what they did was, they established the 1947 National Security Act, which adopted the rules of ethical [sic] military conduct which the military had been using for years to protect our country's secrets [!!! - Ed.]. [But] what actually happened was that we have never had such cascade of losse s of national secrets, intelligence secrets, technology secrets, since that time. Never. It's been unprecedente d in American history that we have lost this much information'. 'The reality was and is that the National Security Act of 1947... it was just to cover crimes. It was not to cover secrets'. So here we have an admission, from a man identified and labelled as a 'former' DIA officer (but who is also reported to be a CIA operative) who clearly remained -at least until 9/11, and given the failure of the Phillipses to respond to the Author's letter despite the inviting tone of their publicity material, allegedly remains - involved with the intelligence services, that the purpose of the National Security Act of 1947 is to provide the entire intelligence community with carte blanche to commit heinous serial crimes, including those already alluded to in this analysis. This is a view with which the very best independent analysts agree, and with which the Author most certainly also concurs. In order for the Republic to save itself, the most drastic repeal of that legislation et seq is an absolute prerequisite; and of course there is not the slightest indication that this is 'about to happen anytime soon'. PRESIDENT TRUMAN TRIED TO STOP THE NAZI INFLUX... The manifestly sanitised and simplified account by Mark Phillips can be augmented by open domain information. President Truman agreed in September 1946 to authorise Project Paperclip, after the discovery of particle/laser beam weaponry, flying discs (saucer-like vehicles) and other advanced tech nology at German military bases - the War Department having urged that NASA and the CIA must control this technology and the Nazi scientists and engineers working on it. President Truman expressly excluded, though, anyone 'found to have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazism or militarism'. The US War Department's Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) carried out detailed background investigations of the scientists. In February 1947, the Director of JIOA, Bosquet Wev, submitted the first group of German scientists' dossiers to the US State and Justice Departments for review. Most of the dossiers were damning and the visa requests of the first batch were all denied. This infuriated Wev, who wrote a memorandum warning that 'the best interests of the United States have been subjected to efforts expended in \"beating a dead Nazi horse\"' - a state-"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"236 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler ment which contained two errors: first, importing these evil men would, as a senior British intelligence officer warned, prove to have fatal consequences over the longer term; and secondly, the Nazi horse was by no means dead, just feigning tiredness. Meanwhile the Director of Central Inte lligence (CIA), Allen Dulles, whom the Author has already identified as a German (Nazi) Abwehr agent (information derived from British intelligence sources), had formed an unhealthy friendship and partnership with General Reinhard Gehlen, the former Nazi intelligence chief operating in the Soviet Union. Gehlen began by feeding false 'informa tion' to Dulles, and consequently to Truman, which appeared to show that the Sovi ets were poised to attack the West. Specifically, he reported that the Soviet forces in Easter n Europe were comprised of 208 crack assault divisions, most of which were high-speed motorised rifle and tank divisions, Gehlen's data showing that the Communists outnumbered Western forces in Europe by a ratio of ten-to-one. Then, early in 1947, Gehlen informed the newly consol- idated but fledgling CIA that his agents had noticed subtle changes in Soviet billeting and leave policies, and that troops were being re called for some unspecified reason, which he implied could be the start of a preparation phase for the suspected invasion. This was followed by an outright prediction by General Gehlen that the Soviets would move rapidly once all troops and equipment had been activat ed, and that it would not be long before Western Europe suffered a Soviet Blitzkrieg. [See also Chapter 8]. All these reports were calculated disinformation concocted by Gehlen, since by 1946 the Soviet Army was over-extended, under-equipped and exhausted from prior combat. Many of the battalions that had reached Ber lin had arrived on foot. There was not even sufficient motorised transport to move one entire division without depriving another of its motorised assets. Almost 50% of the Red Army's transportation was still horse-drawn! Additionally, US Army intelligence had itself established that the bulk of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe were bogged down rebuilding th e Eastern Zones, reorganising security (intelligence) structures following the 'defection' of Gehlen, suppressing the local populations, and performing official administrative functions. Indeed the US military intelligence estimate was that Soviet ground and air forces would not be combat effective against the Western powers for at least a decade. But, willingly 'duped' by Gehlen, and convi nced by Bosquet Wev's arguments, the Abwehr agent Allen Dulles had the Nazi scientists' dossiers rewritten to delete incriminating Nazi evidence, as a result of which manoeuvre, the Gehlen scientists were delivered to the CIA via the Agency's own airline, Capital International Airways. The Agency subsequently embarked upon a myriad programmes derived from, triggered and inspired by the Nazis' mad research, including MK-ULTRA/ARTICHOKE and OPERAT ION MIDNIGHT CLIMAX. The man most responsible for this carefully planned Nazi 'switch' was Dulles, who became Director of Central Intelligence. During and following the so-called 'collapse' of the Soviet Bloc (orchestrated by the KGB-GRU, with expert US and Western 'Fin ancial Warfare' assistance), a significant cadre of East German STASI operatives mysteriously 'switched' sides and have been monitored 'working for' US intelligence. One of these operatives is a certain Eva Teleki (nee Sturzl). Under instructions from a very high-up US source, she appeared at a jail in which the US intelligence hero Leo Wanta was being illegally and unjustly held, and procured a Power of Attorney over an estimated $69 billion of funds. In 2004 she transferred to London. STASI is cover for DVD. This represented a tran sfer of US funds into the hands of the Nazi Black intelligence agency based at Dachau. Nothing has changed."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 237 TRUMAN WAS DOUBLE-CROSSED BY THE NAZIS INSIDE THE C.I.A. Writing in 'The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ' in 1985, Ms. Linda Hunt, also the author of 'Secret Agenda', wrote that she had examined more than 130 reports on Project Paperclip subjects, and had found that every one of them 'had been changed to eliminate the security threat classification'. The American people, and the whole world, are now paying the price for this millennial error of judgment. Meanwhile President Truman, who had explicitly required the Project Paperclip legislation to preclude the importation of Nazi scientists, was evidently never made aware that his directive ha d been violated, a fact that State Department archives and memoirs from that era confirm. According to another analyst, Clare Lasby, Project Paperclip officials 'covered their designs with such secrecy that it bedevilled their own President; at Potsdam, he denied their activities and undoubtedly enhanced Russian suspicion and distrust' - since the Soviets knew from their own HUMINT sources what was going on. In other words, Stalin thought that Truman had lied to him; and there is nothing that a liar loathes more than being lied to. However what had happened was that Truman's own intelligence structures had doubl e-crossed him and had withheld from him the truth of the matter, which is treason. An example of how the details of key scient ists' backgrounds were sa nitised in this way by the US intelligence services - thereby serving their own interests, and those of the Germans/Illuminati, rather than those of the American people as was required by President Truman - applies to the dossier on Dr Werner von Braun, the most celebrated of the imported German scientists. A US military intelligence report on the German rocket scientist dated 18th September 1946 stated that 's ubject is regarded as a potential security threat by the Military Governor'. But the following February, a revised security evaluation of von Braun stated that 'no derogatory information is available on this subject. ... It is the Military Governor's opinion that he may not [sic!] constitute a security threat to the United States'. Nazi characters admitted into the United States thanks to this egregious treachery, procured by means of Nazi penetration of the US intelligence community - which flew in the face of the wishes and precise intentions of the President and Congress of the United States - were some of the blackest [see also pages 215-219]: Arthur Rudolph: The wartime Operations Director of the previously mentioned Mittelwerk factory at the Dora-Nordgausen c oncentration camps, wh ere 20,000 workers died from beatings, hangings and starvation. Rudolph had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1931. In 1945, a military file on this crea ture had reported: '100% Nazi, dangerous type, security threat!!! Sugges t internment'. By contrast the JIOA's final dossier on him stated that there was 'nothing in his records indicating that he was a war criminal or an ardent Nazi or otherwise objectionable'. So Dr Rudolph, fresh from presiding over those deaths and beatings at Dora-Nordgausen, became a US citizen and later designed the Saturn-5 rocket used in the Apollo moon landings. But in 1984, when his war record was finally re- investigated, he fled to West Germany, which did NOT extradite him back to the United States. Wernher von Braun: From 1937 to 1945, von Braun was the technical director of the Peenemunde rocket research centre, where the V2 rocket, which (contrary to Mark Phillips' flaccid comment) devastated parts of the United Kingdom, was developed. By 1970, this man, whose Nazi past had been 'expunged for the record', was the associate Administrator of the US National Aer onautics and Space Ad ministration (NASA). Kurt Blome: This high-ranking Nazi scientist told US military interrogators in 1945 that he had been ordered in 1943 to experime nt with plague vaccines on concentration"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"238 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler camp prisoners. He was tried at Nuremberg in 1947 on charges of practicing euthanasia (extermination of sick prisoners), and of conducting experiments on human beings. Although acquitted, his earlier admissions were well known, and most observers were of the opinion that this man had participated in Satanic experimentation against humans. Two months after his Nuremberg acquittal, Blome was interviewed at Camp David, Maryland, on issues connected with biological warfare. In 1951, he was hired by the US Army Medical Corps to work on chemical warfare projects. His file made no mention of Nuremberg. Major General Walter Schreiber: According to Ms. Linda Hunt's article for the well- respected Atomic Scientists' organisation, the US Military Tribunal at Nuremberg heard evidence that 'Schreiber had assigned doctors to experiment on concentration camp prisoners and had made the funds available for such experimentation'. The Assistant Prosecutor said that this evidence would have resulted in Schreiber's conviction if the Soviets, who had held him from 1945 to 1948, had made him available for trial. Once again, Schreiber's Paperclip file made no mention of this evidence. So 'The Project' found work for this fellow at the Ai r Force School of Medici ne at Randolph Field, Texas. When the conscientious columnist, Drew Pearson, publicised the Nuremberg evidence in 1952, the resulting negative publicity led the JIOA to arrange a visa and a job for Schreiber in the Nazi state of Argentina, where his daughter was living; and on 22 May 1952, Schreiber was flown to Buenos Aires. Hermann Becker-Freysing and Siegfried Ruff: These two, with Kurt Blome, were among 23 defendants in the Nuremberg War Tri bunal 'medical case'. Becker-Freysing was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail for having conducted experiments on inmates at Dachau concentration camp - starving th em, and force-feeding them sea water that had been chemically altered to make it drinkable. Ruff was acquitted in a close decision on charges that he had killed as many as 80 Dachau inmates in a low-pressure chamber designed to simulate altitudes in excess of 60, 000 feet. As already indicated, before their trial, Becker-Freysing and Ruff were paid by the US military to write reports about their grotesque experiments on human beings. In October 1945, a US Navy technical mission to Dachau concentration camp reported in detail on various Ge rman wartime experiments carried out on inmates, using hallucinogenic drugs. These were directed by th e previously mentioned odious Dr Hubertus Strughold, who was also imported to the United States under Project Paperclip after the War. This ogre's barbaric 'medical experiments' , for which his subordinates were tried and convicted as war criminals at Nuremburg, amounted to 'nothing more than a series of bizarre and unspeakably brutal to rtures. Even so, he learned a lot', wrote the independent US expert, Michael E. Kreca 17 , in 2001, 'about human behaviour and a natural alkaloid found in the peyote cactus called mescaline' (that substance long central to many Native American and Australian aborigine religious rituals). While the Project Paperclip Nazi opera tives were settling down in the United States, General Gehlen - havi ng convinced the Americans than ks to the Nazis' placement of their Abwehr agent Dulles in the 'top slot' that, given his unrivalled knowledge and contacts, he was the right man to rehabilitate the German intelligence community - began re-establishing his presence in West Germany, after receiving the go-ahead from Allen Dulles to establish a quasi-'private' intelligence organisation, to be called The Gehlen Organisation, which became the DVD, based at Dachau. This of course quickly regained control of most of the former agents now based inside the Iron Curtain; and,"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 239 with the help of many of his former staff, Gehlen put many of them back to work. In spite of 'agreeing' with the Americans (not Dulles) not to hire any former Gestapo, SS or SD members, he nevertheless sought them out a nd placed them on the payroll (financed by the CIA, i.e., the CIA's payroll), regardless of hi s undertaking; and of course the by now deeply Nazi-penetrated CIA did nothing to prevent him. A similar state of affairs arose in Iraq in 2004, when the US authorities, lacking adequate (or indeed any worthwhile) HUMINT, re-hired Ba'ath party thugs, military and operati ves, having earlier ruled out any such hirings. This 'came naturally' to certain US cadres, given that the Iraqi Ba'ath regime (like its Syrian counterpart) was modelled upon Hitler's Th ird Reich. The fact that it was s upported by the Soviets, who built a large number of bases in Iraq to 'match' the American military bases constructed in Saudi Arabia inter alia by the CIA's Vinnell Corporation, should not mislead us: for, traditionally, Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) has been extensively penetrated by deep cover German (Nazi) operatives. Heinrich Rupp: Rupp has been convicted in the United States of bank fraud. As a CIA operative, he was deeply involved in th e Savings and Loan scandals and scams masterminded in part by elements of the co rrupted US intelligence community, including allegedly members of the Bush ('Crime') Fa mily. A Federal Grand Jury reported their acceptance of the veracity of testimony that Rupp, the late CIA Director William Casey, who was then Ronald Reagan's Campaign Mana ger, and Donald Gr egg, who became US Ambassador to South Korea, flew in a supersonic military aircraft with George Bush Sr. and other operatives to Paris in 1980, during the election campaign in which Bush Sr. was on the ticket with Ronald Reagan. The testimony in question stated that three meetings were held on 19-20 October 1980 at the Hotel Florida and the Hotel Crillon. It was at this meeting, according to court testimony, that arrangements were made to sabotage President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign by procuring a delay in the release of the US hostages in Tehran until after Mr Carter had been defeated (popular frustration at the hostage crisis being, as predicted, to blame for his defeat). The hostages were indeed released on 20th January 1981, immediately after Reagan and Bush Sr. were sworn into office. Iran had been promised the release of its financial assets which had been frozen by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the basi s for the subsequent Ir an-Contra scandals was established. This effective 'coup d'etat', known as the 'October Surprise', necessitated the transfer of George Bush Sr. from the United States to Paris and back for a scheduled appointment in such a manner that no-one would know he had ever left (a precaution which ended in failure, since extensive details of this operation have since leaked into the public domain). Some $45 million of 'Black Operations' funds was procured to bribe the Iranians to comply with the US political operatives' requireme nts, but only $32 million was paid to them - the rest having been 'misappropriated' en route. The stealing of such secret 'Black' funds goes on all the time. One of the guests at the Inauguration of President Reagan was Licio Gelli, founder of the secret neo-Fascist Masonic Lodge P-2 - a double agent for the CIA and the KGB, identified by Mark Phillips and Cathy O'Brien as 'the central figure in Europe and South America that linked the CIA, [the] Masoni c Lodge, the Vatican, ex-Nazis and several South American Governments, the Italian Government, and several international banks' - key flluminati players of the New Underworld Order. Among Gehlen's 'recruits' were Franz 'Streber' Six and Emil Augsburg, members of an SS mobile Death's Head (Totenkopf) killing squad that had hunted down and murdered Soviet Jews, intellectuals and partisans. Gehlen also re-recruited the Gestapo"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"240 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler Chiefs of Paris and Kiel, as well as Willi Krichb aum, the (Jewish) former senior Gestapo chief for Southeastern Europe. The fact is that, as mentioned, the OSS, a nd its then relabelled successor intelligence organisation, the CIG (Central Intelligence Group), forerunner of the CIA, deliberately chose, thanks to the successful Nazi penetration of US intelligence at the highest level by the Abwehr agent Allen Dulles, to 'believe' Ge neral Gehlen's lies a bout Soviet military capabilities - because his false arguments facilitated their intended annexation of the Nazi scientists, contrary to Presidential and Congressional instructions. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ALREADY IN THE DRIVING SEAT IN THE 1940S It was thus already the case, immediately fo llowing the Second World War (and indeed previously) that the US intelligence community was driving and detenruning US policy, not the other way round, although the intelligen ce cadres were always meticulous about making sure that, for public perception purposes, the Executive and Legislative branches appeared to remain in charge. Today, that process has go ne so far beyond the point of no return that the disconnect between what the American public perceives to be the White reality - that the Republic has a Constitution and a Government that abides by it and serves the people - and the Black actualite', is complete. Nor ca n members of Congress do their job properly: all their Capitol Hill and private office telecommunications are permanently bugged by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Allen Dulles was indeed a traitor to the United States: he knew perfectly well that Reinhard Gehlen was lying through his teeth about the Soviet threat. All veteran OSS agents would have known that the Soviet di visional resources were far less strong in manpower than the US and Western equivalent. A Soviet division was typically one-third as strong as an American divisi on, and its leadership was far less effective. Rather than being able to function in combat with flexibility, with officers able to make on-the-spot field decisions, Soviet officers had to wait for or ders from upper-echelon sources before reacting to any change in the flow-of-battle. Since they retained in their collective memory horrific details of Stalin's purges, they dared not act on their own initiative, for fear of being shot at dawn. This rigidity had at times caused the Soviets grievous losses and defeats; whereas, by contrast, the US and British forces had encouraged battlefield decisions to be made at the lowest levels during the heat of conflict. According to a 'former' CIA officer, 'Gehlen's reports and analyses were sometimes just retyped onto CIA stationery and pres ented to President Truman without further comment'. This represents a remarkable level of outright foreign penetration. If the President had been on his toes he would have queried the absence of commentaries by the CIA sources, but obviously he wasn't that bright. President Truman reacted by ceasing military budget cuts, increasing spending for weapons research, military equipment and the (Nazi-inspired) space programme, and e xpanding the nuclear weapons programme. These decisions led to what became the nuclear ch arade, or strategic deception. The threat of a nuclear winter (assiduously promulgated by He rmann Kahn), and the fact that two nuclear devices cannot be detonated t oo close together in time, has long since made nuclear war 'inconceivable'. President Truman's change of mind, consequent upon the fact that his own intelligence services were purveying General Reinhard Gehlen's lies to him without comment, also resulted in the CIA being at the receiving end of millions of 'Black' dollars for covert operations. In the decade following the end of the War, the CIA consumed a large tranche of funds that it never accounted for."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 241 According to Victor Marchetti, a former ch ief analyst specialising in Soviet military capabilities, and author of a study entitled 'The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence', 'the Agency loved Gehlen because he fed us what we wanted to hear. We used his stuff constantly, and we fed it to everyone else: th e Pentagon, the White House, the newspapers. They loved if. Here is another open admission, into the White world, by an arrogant CIA operative, confirming that, as early as i mmediately after the Second World War, US intelligence was already completely out of control - deceiving the President, the military brass, and the American people via the press, as it pursued its own secret occult-esoteric power agenda. But actually, this agenda hadn't been originated by the US intelligence community at all: it was fed to and grafted onto the US intelligence structures by means of deep penetration, subtle influence-building, agitprop and corruption operations masterminded by the Nazi International from its headquarters initially established in Madrid during the Second World War. How the German Geopolitical Centre achieved this U-turn within the US intelligence and policymaking communities, building on the treachery of their Abwehr agent Allen Dulles, is recounted in Chapter 8. Immediately after making the admission outlined above, Marchetti concurred that Gehlen was a consummate liar and a waste of time and space: 'Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of, so we would give him more money to tell us about it. In my opinion, the Gehlen Organisation provided nothing worthwhile for understanding or estimating Soviet military or political capabilities in Eastern Europe or anywhere else'. That was true: but Marchetti never understood the bigger picture. TRIUMPH OF A COVERT NAZI DISINFORMATION OPERATION For the reality was that the US intelligence and official structures fell victim to a massive German disinformation and strategic deception ope ration, the effect of which was to confirm the transfer of the mentality and certain of the structures of Hitler's Third Reich across the Atlantic, where it is flourishing as never befo re, and where it threatens - and this is no exaggeration - a repetition of the Nazi population reduction and control atroc ities on a far larger scale. The Author believes that he may li ve to see this happening in his lifetime, unless exposure can thwart this catastrophe. The resulting Cold War, fostered by Gehlen's lies and leveraged by the Nazi agent Dulles, which lasted for almost 50 years, cost US taxpayers alone approximately $8.0 trillion. The careful reader will have noticed that, since the US intelligence community knew, from the outset (a) that Soviet military ca pabilities were greatly inferior to US and Western capabilities, and (b) that nuclear wa r was out of the question for the technical reason cited above, the CIA, DIA, NSA, ONI and the rest of these intelligence organisations were deceiving the American public on this crucial issue for half a century. They were doing this, in part, because they had become ho oked on mind-control operations and on searching for the ultimate tec hnologies of political control, ideas which were first developed in both Germany and in Britain, where an early pan-German penetration had taken place into the Tavistock Institute. And th e targets of this nefarious endeavour are the innocent American people themselves. Perfection of such technologies and intermeddling with the occult and the 'Ancient Mysteries', and the culture of lies that their development entails, enable privileged, Satanised intelligence elites modelled along Himmlerian lines, whose crimes are covered by blanket secrecy legislation, and which empl oy official appointments and political office as cover, to practice those very abuses that they condemn for public con-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"242 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler sumption in the White world - money-laundering, stealing public funds, drug-dealing, orchestrating terrorism and the engineering of a classic revolutionary Period of Escalating Violence, for instance - in order to invoke the proliferation of these evils as justification for the enslavement of their citizens, which in turn becomes essentia l in order for the criminalised intelligence cadres' crimes to be covered up.

Hence the United States' Patriot Acts I, and II and III, and Britain's not orious Civil Contingencies Bill, 'guillotined' through the complacent Westminster Parliament in 2004-05, which provides Ministers, whips and any individuals they may designate, with powers to do anything they like, having declared a State of Emergency on the basis of extremely widely-drawn criteria. In other words, both countries have put in place the means to dispense with the annoyances and expense of 'democracy' altogether, in the face of evils or 'Reichstag Fire'-type events for which they are capable of being responsible. The use of the 'Reichstag Fire' m ass traumatisation technique has been deployed already several times in the United States, yielding the desired mass behaviour modification consequences -and in the case of 9/11, providing the authorities with a pretext for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iran in response to the requirements of the oil corporations. CIA IS PROLIFERATING DEMONIC INFESTATION AND POSSESSION As will have been gathered en passant earlier, the Author was privileged to be a personal friend of the late Dr Malachi Martin, the Jesuit exorcist and author of many great works, including 'Hostage to the Devil' [Perennial Library, 1987 and HarperSanFrancisco 1992], in the course of which Malachi informed the Author in general terms about the mind-control and demonic possession deprogramming and exor cisms in which he was periodically engaged. The reader may wonder why, given the searing criticisms of the Jesuits elaborated in Chapter 6, the Author attaches any impor tance to the late Dr Martin's work and insights: and the 'short-form' answer to this le gitimate query is that, to the Author's certain personal knowledge, Malachi was in the proces s of nearing the completion of a lifelong struggle to 'come out of her' 18 (the entrapment of Jesuitism, if not of the Catholic Church itself). It became clear to the Author that this great, late and sadly missed authority - blessed, there was no doubt, by the Holy Spirit when the Author first met him - made no distinction between programmed mind-control (by whatever Himmlerian or Tavistock-related 'technology' it had been procured), and possession by evil spirits. He knew that meddling with the occult, leveraging the Black Magic of the 'Ancient Mysteries', was a trap into which the US inte lligence community had fallen, and that, as is inevitably the case, the consequences of such entrapment are unspeakable. As a Jesuit who understood and knew the evil ways of the Vatican and his own order, and was therefore familiar of course with the Jesuit tradition ('technology') of mind and personality programming and manipulation [see Chapter 6], and as a priest who was nevertheless at times imbued and led by the Holy Spirit, he was in a position to know the truth of this matter. It follows from all this evidence alone that , in failing to take a long spoon to their unending Satanic banquet with the Nazi scie ntists and their Hirnmlerian mind-control experiments, which have proliferated ever since, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies involved in this demented, reprobate activity, have been proliferating demonic infestation and possession all over the United States, and externa lly.

'Religion' now includes every form of pagan abomination under the sun, as any visitor to one of these stores can easily verify. The Author enjoyed a long telephone conversation with Malachi, who was born on 23rd July 1921, exactly one week before his death in New York City on 27th July 1999. On that occasion, the often merry Irish pr iest was full of his usual banter, as well as indulging in very serious conversation with his unworthy interlocutor. The purpose of the phone call had been that the Author wanted to know whether he wished to continue his subscription to 'Soviet Analyst', a publication edited since 1991 by the Author. 'Oh yes, please, you're my lifeline', he said over-generously. Some time earlier, Malachi had told the Author of an incident when he had been thrown by a powerful force from his writing stool, in the small cell-like room where he worked, in his friend's apartment on East 63rd Street. The lady of the house and her daughter had just left to go shopping. Shortly after they left, Malachi was flung to the floor by a force so strong and oppressive that he was unable to get up, and felt he might have languished, badly hurt, until he died. But the two women, who were smokers, had forgotten their cigarettes. So they retraced their steps, rode back up the elevator, and reentered their apartment - whereupon they found Malachi lyin g in a desperate state. 'Their cigarette addiction saved my life', Malachi had quipped. He had been certain that Evil Spirit had objected so strongly to what he was exposing in his books, that it had been unable to tolerate his activities any longer. That event reminds the Author that in the course of preparing this book, as mentioned earlier, the computer program automatically opened up a sequence of precisely 322 blank pages. After relating this story, Malachi explained (as he did in 'Hostage to the Devil') how vulnerable the exorcist is to an attack during exorcism, and how he needs always to pray for protection, in case of such an attack. The Author has it on impeccable personal authority that Malachi suffered his fatal heart attack wh ile in the process of exorcising a severely possessed young girl - exactly one week, as mentioned, after the Author had enjoyed his last conversation with him. In one of his final public interviews, in 1999, Malachi alluded to the exponential increase in occult devilry that was and is permeating North America (and the United Kingdom, as well). 'For the first time in the work we have been doing for 31 years in this corner of the globe, during the last ten years or so, we have found young men and women, thirty-somethings or twenty-somethings, coming forward and saying: 'Listen, I made a pact with the Devil. I wanted this woman. I wanted this man. I wanted this job. I wanted this money. I wanted this, this, and this, and I made a pact and he gave it to me and now I can't get rid of him. He dominates my will. Please liberate me. And then people get to it by means of things like an ouija board, or by spiritual means or channelling'. And by being abused by US intelligen ce mind-control technology and personality- splitting programmes derived originally from the experiments undertaken by Heinrich Himmler's Nazi scientists on concentration camp victims. Referring generally to the Luciferians' a pparent hegemony, Dr Martin elaborated: 'We are now, according to the official doctrine of the Luciferians, in what they call 'the Availing Time'. They have a tradition that in these years they can avail of the time to install the Prince, who is Lucifer, as the greatest power on earth, in charge of human civilization, and adored by men'."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 245 This is that Lucifer, 'that old serpent, ca lled the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world' 19 - the god of Masonry, to which candidates are progressively introduced, as they are sucked deeper and deeper into the false, esoteric world of lies, the 'Ancient Mysteries' and murder which it has to offer, the god worshipped by 'high' Masons who are intelligence officers, by the holders of high office whom they have abused under their nefarious mind-control programmes, and whose children the intelligence services themselves routinely target for paedophilia and mind-control purposes. And since Lucifer is a liar, all those who do or condone these things are, by definition, themselves deluded and deceived: and the pathetic dimension to all of this is that while they know perfectly well that this is the case, they con tinue down this path to destruction and the pit. To repeat: as Paul writes in verse 32 of the first Chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, these evil people 'knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them'. Thus Paul knew, by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, that those wh o do these things, and perpetrate these abominations (a) know that what they are doing will lead them to the pit of destruction (for as indicated earlier, they are not atheists), (b) yet continue with their abominations and (c) obtain satisfaction in doing them and in others doing them, and in enticing others to do them. The Author knows of several instances in which US operatives have threatened each other with death; and since embarking on these enquiries, the Author has himself received seven separate such threats from these pathetic mental defectives, for daring to even think of exposing some of their serial abominations. Malachi's interviewer asked to what end these deluded people were seeking to enthrone Satan on earth, and he replied simply: 'To exalt the power of Lucifer. That's the end in itself. It's the [sole] Luciferian purpose. If they don't do it in these years, then it is put off sine die, without resolution. They are very keen on getting it done'. Authoritatively distinguishing between Satanism and Luciferianism, Malachi also had this to say, as has previously been noted, in part: There is a layer of Satanism, of Satanist ritual which prepares people fo r perfect Luciferian adoption. Th ey [Satanists] have covens and sacrifices and rites. But the Luciferians have no rites, you know.... [Such levels of Satanism are] a preparation for Luciferianism, and there ar e reversals sometimes. You will find a crowd of Luciferians having a Satanic ritual as a reminder of things. But they [Luciferians, who consider themselves 'of a higher order'] have all passed through [the relevant niuminati initiation rites] and that involves three things : the infliction of pain without flinching, the infliction of death without flinching, and the use of fire'. So, bombing the hell out of civilian populations, using the most lethal weapons imaginable, is not an issue for these 'inventors of evil things' 20 . Dropping fragmentation bombs on civilian populations is not an issue for the British or the American military, just as the abominations inflicted by the covert Soviet military in Chechnya and elsewhere are 'no problem' for the Illuminati's operatives in the Kremlin. Sexually abusing defenceless prisoners in the hell-holes of Abu Ghraib, the eight other such hell-holes in Iraq, the CIA control centres in Jordan, at Guantanamo, on the British island of Diego Garcia, and in any of the 23 prison hell-holes the United States has set up in Afghanistan directed from its main base at Kandahar (which, like Babylon and Tripoli just happens to sit on the esoterically important - for the Luciferians - 33rd pa rallel), is not an issue 21 .

This is the same as the US Illuminati concept of 'collateral damage'. If 100,000-300,000 people have been murdered in Iraq, that is 'collateral damage'. When the Author as ked a US operative with extensive experience inside the 'former' USSR what was the difference between the attitude towards murder of the KGB-GRU and of US intelligence, he said: 'Not much. The Russians k ill more'. BRIEF PROFILES OF MIND-CO NTROLLED ASSASSIN-OPERATIVES One purpose of personality-splitting brainwashing operations is to create and maintain a large and expanding cadre of individuals suitable for recruitment as controllable operatives and assassins who will do the really dirty work, in response to instructions from their handlers. These multiple-split personalities have been program med in such a manner that they have been made (through deviant sexual means and ot her ways of manipulating the psyche) responsive to trigger-phrases, often based upon make-believe stories such as 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Alice in Wonderland', as described by the Phillipses in their books. The Author and his associates have been informed repeatedly by US operatives, almost as though their statements represented warnings, that it is standard practice for one's children to be targeted. All children of intelligence officers in the Washington and Virginia areas are targeted, and large numbers wind up ab used, and in various states of mental and physical disarray as a consequence. Some children of 'Illuminati' parents are genetically- bred to function as outstanding psychics. Among these, a number are trained to perform as psychic assassins, possessing the ab ility to induce cardiac arrest or neural dysfunction. It is said that the former Soviet General-Se cretary Yuri Andropov (Lieberman), was assassinated in this manner. Among the more notorious 'lone nutcases' who were in fact MK-ULTRA-type programmed split personalities developed for assassination purposes, and who could be triggered by their hand lers to perform assassinations on demand, were: Sirhan Sirhan: This assassin was programmed at a racing stables in Santa Ana, California by two CIA mind-control specialists - one of them a priest. A co-worker of Sirhan at the stables was Thomas Bremer, w hose mind-controlled brother Arthur, shot Governor George Wallace in 1972. Not many miles from the stables is a Synagogue used for mind-control purposes. Its rabbi is a 'former' O ffice of Naval Intelligence (ONI) officer. It is well known within the ranks of the Los Ange les Police Department (LAPD) that mind- controlled 'patsy' Sirhan Sirhan, in keeping with the 'patsy' who was arrested for the murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin, actua lly fired blanks at Robert Kennedy, in order to misdirect the attention of eyewitnesses. At l east one police officer's eyewitness report was re-written by a senior officer in order to protect the true conspirators. Moreover, police radio communication was disrupted (as in the Princess Diana assassination) thereby preventing the broadcasti ng of the descriptions of other suspects. B ill Kurtis's TV show, A & E Investigative Report, on the assassination of R obert Kennedy, suggested that Sirhan Sirhan was a mind-controlled assassin or 'p atsy' created under Project ARTIC HOKE. This programme was developed in order to create 'Manchurian Candidate' assassins (omega victims), who could be programmed to kill a target and then not even remember they had ever killed anyone at all. Sirhan Sirhan was per-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 247 fect for the job. Angry at the death of his parents during a conflict with Israel, the convicted assassin of Robert Kennedy was said to have been in a trance-like state during and after the shooting. Later, Sirhan Sirhan affirmed emphatically that he did not actually remember anything that happened during the shooting. [This reference to Project ARTICHOKE suggests that it had a specific purpose, so that the earlier references to ARTIC HOKE being one of the precursors of MK-ULTRA may not be wholly accurate. Artichoke rhymes with heart and choke, so it was probably concerned specifically with the training, personality- splitting and mind-controlling of assassins]. William Joseph Bryan, Jr.: One of the drummers with the Tommy Dorsey Band for some time was a certain William Joseph Bryan, Jr. (a.ka. William Joseph Bryon, and W illiam Jenning Bryan HI, etc.). William Joseph Bryan, Jr. was a CIA mind-control creep who programmed people when he was with the Air Force as Chief of Medical Survival Training, which was a covert brainwashing section. Bryan opened up his own Hypnotherapy Institute on Sunset Strip in Hollywood, where he programmed targets for service to the Illuminati. It was this particular Bryan (a familiar CIA false name) who programmed Sirhan Sirhan to kill Robert Kennedy. John Hinckley: This young man who wounded Ronald Reagan is another mind- controlled victim who has been unfairly vi ctimised. Hinckley was programmed in Lexington by an aide to a British Intelligence psychiatrist, who had previously pro- grammed the Son-of-Sam Satanic cultist David Berkowitz, a member of a Los Angeles Satanic cult called The Children, at a Westch ester, NY, mind-control 'facility'. Like Patrick Purdy, who massacred seven Vietnamese children in a Stockton, California schoolyard, Hinckley had associated with neo-Nazis and had been prescribed mood- altering neuroleptic pharmaceuticals. Curt Cobain of the 'musical' group 'Nirvana', was another victim, on this occasion of National Security Agency (NSA) brainwashing, and was 'terminated' by the NSA. Cobain, like Jimmy Hendrix, had started writing clues about the NSA's activities into his music, to communicate some idea of what wa s happening, to his music followers. This was a dangerous departure, given the extensiv e involvement of the CI A, for instance, in the drug-ridden 'country music' industry (which was and remains a key CIA outlet for its drugs). He referred in his music to the NSA as the 'friends inside his head' (i.e., his demon 'familiars'). Once the NSA puts on the highest level of brainwashing pain, the subject expires quickly. Cobain used heroin to numb and otherwise diminish the effect of the brainwashing. [Note: That victim's reference to 'friends inside his head' is typical of classic demonic infestation or possession. At the Gorbachev Foundation/State of the World Forum event in San Francisco in September 1995, the Communist ag itator Barbara Marx Hubbard told an audience that sh e had a 'familiar' called 'John' whom she consulted at all times. Malachi Martin wrote about familiars in his classic work 'Hostage to the Devil']. The Jonestown, Guyana, massacre, a group control experiment: Survivors of Jonestown have testified as to the effectiveness of the group control 'technology' used in Jamestown. After this gruesome experiment in mind-control was terminated with a massacre, large amounts of drugs were discovered. Just one footlocker at Jonestown alone contained 11,000 doses. The authorities prevented chemical autopsies of the bodies to ensure secrecy of the sophisticated concentration camp, which was used for medical and psychiatric experimentation by the CIA.

There was no way to stop th e killings. All members of the cult were programmed to at least 'Level Three'. Only three deaths were attributable to cyanide; the rest died from gunfire. [Again, discussion of demonic infestation 'l evels', or 'alters', is most authoritatively discussed by Fr. Malachi Martin in 'Hostage to the Devil']. David Koresh: This operative/mind-controlled programmed assassin was a long time CIA asset. Waco had been a CIA centre for mind-control ever since the end of the Sec ond World War. Many of the German Nazi mind-control sc ientists were brought to Waco to continue their experiments. The Waco 'sleepers' (of which there were seven in number) had somehow been triggered, and they were preparing to carry out their preprogrammed responses. The 'sleepers' in the compound were created to be programmed domestic terrorists and can be compared to the members of the Japanese cult, Aunt Shinri Kyo, which bombed the Tokyo subway with Sarin gas and kille d and wounded hundreds of people. The seven sleepers in the Waco compound were within days of manufactur ing a nerve gas toxin that would have been powerful enough to kill up to 350,000 people. A total of 86 men, women, and children were murdered in the Branch Davidian compound on M onday, 19th April 1993 -ALL of them at the hands of the four members of a CIA 'wet' team, operating unde r cover of the Delta Force. This atrocity had been preceded by another such event at Ruby Ridge. One message delivered as a consequence of this atro city - which officials justified at the time on the basis that it allegedly prevented a far worse atrocity occurring (the deaths of 350,000 people) - was that the authorities want the American people to know the horror that will befall people who defy the Government, which is of course itself the cause of these Satanic disturbances. Port Arthur Massacre, Tasmania, Aust ralia: On Sunday 28th April 1996, an un known professional combat shooter opened fire in the Broad Arrow Cafe at Port Arthur in Tasmania. In less than five minutes, 20 people lay dead, 19 of them killed with single shots to the head, fired from the right hip of the fast-moving shooter. The awesome display of combat marksmanship was blamed on intellectually impaired Martin Bryant ('Bryan' again) who was held in illegal strict solitary confinement for more than 120 days, until he was 'ready' to plead guilty. But no trial ever took place. He was probably liquidated. Other Tone nutters' (in the United States) who never stood trial include Mark David Chapman, Sirhan Sirhan {see page 246), James Earl Ray, Lee Harvey Oswald and David Berkowitz. A court trial is a nuisance and dangerous for the Illuminists. [Note: Australia is extensively involved in these intelligence operations under secret accords with Britain and the United States. As pects of the New Underworld Order will be run from a vast underground control centre ne ar Alice Springs. This facility houses developments which are understood to have ma de a hardened and cynical US intelligence officer whose identity is known to the Author, to exit the facility as fa st as he could, and to cease work which had involv ed frequent visits there]. John Lennon: Shortly before Lennon's death at the hands of a mind-controlled 'Manchurian Candidate'-type assassin, Mark Chapman, hi red to 'terminate' Lennon who had by then become his own man and w as considered a 'loose cannon', Lennon had had the audacity to 'ouf his mind-m anipulation perpetrators in a Playboy interview, in which he had not only revealed details of LSD's comp letely unforeseen liberating impact upon human society and civilization, but also, even more to the point, had indicated that he was, like Cobain and Hendrix, aware of the extent to which he and other pop musicians had been set up by 'dark forces'- for use as mass sensitisation dupes.

One month, to the day, after Columbine, another similar shooting occurred in Georgia. Such sc hool killings, another of which occurred in Dunblane, Scotland (although this also aimed to cover up a vast high-level rent-boy scandal), are intended to inflame anger and hysteria, as occurred in early September 2004 in the 'former' Soviet Union in the case of the Beslan massacre of hundreds of schoolchildren. In the Un ited States, Great Britain, Australia, and now the 'former' USSR, the media whips up anger and hysteria and keeps it fresh in the public's mind - with continual graphic, around the clock 'overkill' coverage and commentary on the dead and wounded victims, the pain and suffering of the families, and the traumatic scars left on children who watch television all over the world. In the United States, President Clinton, a CIA operative working to instructions of course (although this man is also a very 'high' Mason), exploited the hysteria of the moment to blame guns for the problems in America's schools; whereupon, amid all the hysteria, Congress was pressured to pass more guns la ws. But it gets worse. It is also true, in the US context, that in order to condition the public into supporting stricter gun-control measures - an absolute nece ssity for the conspirators, given America's gun-ownership tradition - mind-controlled children have been programmed to shoot classmates. One of the Columbine High-School shooters, Eric Harris, used to live at Plattsburg Air Force Base, in New York State, with his Air Force officer fa ther. At the age of ten, Harris was allegedly accustomed to complain to his friends that he was being drugged at the base. This base, although officially closed, is known to harbour an enormous underground facility, which is allegedly still being used as a mind-control programming center. One Columbine teacher stated publicly that she was wounded by an adult male, not by a student (four adult gunmen took part). Federal personnel had visited the school earlier. Because of the continuing controversy su rrounding the assassination of President Kennedy - who had demanded that the CIA must cease its drug-trafficking operations, and whom the Nazi International wanted out of the way, which was why he was murdered - the Author has omitted a detailed note here on Lee Harvey Oswald, whose photographs certainly reveal him to have had the profile appropriate for a programmed assassin. Other such MK-ULTRA-spawned assassins have also included, of course, the Satanic Charles Manson, Timothy McVeigh and John Salvi. It is estimated that there are between two and ten million mind-controlled victims in the United States. Victims are usually programmed to slash their arms if their front alter-per-sonality begins to recover memories of the trauma programming. This inhibits further autonomous memory recovery: they occasionally begin to recover memories if their programmer or handler dies. Many have been abused by their parents, a familiar, even standard aberration among Illuminati families. Buford Furrow, arrested for a shooting at the Jewish Community Center, in Granada Hills, California, was admitted to a psychiatric institution after slashing his arm in several places, behaviour consistent with mind-control activity. Significantly, a National Security Council (NSC) e-mail address for a Buford Furrow located at McChord Air Force Base, was deleted after his arrest. Notwithstanding the widespread use of programmed operatives whose handlers can modify their behaviour by triggering their laye red 'alters', colossal blunders costing agents' lives occur quite frequently. On 29th August 2003, US Ambassador Joseph Wilson told a Washington symposium that Karl H. Rove, President Bush's White House 'fixer', had been the person who had leaked to 'The Washington Post' that his wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA operative of 26 years' standing. Her entire overseas team was liquidated."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"250 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler CONFIRMATION OF THE FREE-WH EELING ILLUMINATI AT WORK JANUS, an international Psychological Operations (Psy-Ops) team consisting of high-level scientists, serves NATO and operates from its he adquarters in Belgium, which, as indicated elsewhere, is the financial centre of the Illuminati. In the United States, a group of highly intelligent African-Amer ican women, known as the Black Angels, is maintained by intelligence for Psy-Ops assassination 'wet affairs' (liquidation) work. According to an anonymous and disgusted US intelligence source, a total of 250,000 children in the United States were stolen from the streets over an unspecified period and used for experimentation purposes at 25 intelligence stati ons. The end justifies the means. One of the most notorious manipulative pr ojects of all, called the Montauk Mind- Control Program, was initiated after the Second World War on the old Montauk Air Force Base, Long Island, run by Dr John von Neumann, a pre-war Nazi scientist, and Jack Pruett, an Air Force operative, who was succeeded in due course by Dr Hermann C. Untermann and another Nazi expert (in electronics), Dr Ma tthew E. Zerrett. This project was initially funded by proceeds from the $10 billion worth of Nazi gold captured in 1944 by US troops, in a successful 'Financial Warfare' operation. The last of the Montauk experimental bases was reportedly 'closed down' on 12th August 1983. Dr Von Neumann, who came to the United States, as noted, before the Second Wo rld War, was reported by the US Government to have died in 1956; but in reality he was still alive as late as 1989, and in contact with US intelligence. This penetration suggests that the Nazi apparat had actually engaged in focused penetration ops long before the outbreak of the Second World War. When Hitler's regime had finally been defeated, the German Geopolitical Centre's subtle propagandists fostered the lie that Nazism had perished along with it - a strategic deception operation which has had terrible consequences. The Phillipses have reported, and other so urces concur, that, as has been mentioned, the MR-ULTRA programme, based upon Himmle rian technology, was the 'brainchild' not only of the odious Dr Sydney Gottlieb, but also of Richard Helms, later Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and was intended to complete the development of techniques pioneered by Nazi scientists - including electrical shock, sleep deprivation, memory implantation, memory erasure, sensory modifi cation, psychoactive drug experimentation, and 'many more cruel practices'. 'Project Paperclip', they add, 'ultimately brought in key players involved in the assassination of the Pope, the 'October Surprise' operation - the sabotage of President Carter's peace talks by means of an internal US intelligence- directed coup - 'and a great many other things still classifi ed to this day'. The Phillipses' published research 'shows th at the OSS/CIA that was formed [by] the National Security Act [is] the same agency that [has] employed hundreds of Nazis [and] has been in alliance with the Vatican through various Ag ency connections such as Licio Gelli. The CIA/Vatican alliance that assassina ted Pope John Paul I, John F. Kennedy and dictators of Third World countries, is the Illuminati'. This statement is accurate.

' In the past 150 years, there has been a resurgence of widespread interest in the so-called 'Black Arts' which include Satanism or Luciferian religions . These constitutionally-protected (in the United States) 'religions' use trauma to control the minds of their followers'. ' In 1971, The New York Times reported on ... a report to Congress [which] clearly showed that the CIA was interested in the cause-and-effect clinical findings that occult practices have on t he Black Arts practitioner's and/or the observer's mind. Of particular interest to the CIA were the heightened levels of suggestibility that certain occult rituals produced in the minds of the practitioners. Cannibalism and blood rituals were ranked highest in the order of importance to their research '. ' Linda Hunt, in her book 'Secret Agenda', [cites] decl assified Department of Defense documents identifying Project Paperclip as being the secret importation and relocation of Nazi and Fascist scientists into the United States over a 40-year period. These brilliant criminal scientists were primarily focused on two areas of research, rockets and the mind. They were placed in posit ions of authority in prestigious universities, colleges, industries, and NASA. Over the years, these imported criminals have directly influenced our society with advanced rocket technologies and mind-control applicati ons through US Government-sponsored research.... Nazism, as a philosophy and form of government, is alive and destroying our country, in part, as a result of Project Paperclip'. ' Many US and foreign government secrets and personal reputations were staked on the belief that I could not be deprogrammed and rehabilitated to accurately reveal the crim inal covert [and violently obscene - Ed.] activities in which I (and her daughter Kelly) were forced to participate, particularly during the R eagan/Bush Administrations'. ' Violations of laws and rights, Psychological Warfare inti midation tactics, threats to our lives, and various other forms of CIA Damage Containment practices thus far have remained unhindered and unchecked due to the National Security Act 1947 and the 1986 Reagan amendment to same, which allows those in control of our Government to censor and/or cover up anything they choose ». ' Project MONARCH was a US Defense Intelligence Ag ency TOP SECRET project... a mind-control operation which was [author ma intains use of the past tense, but it's still happening] 'recruiting' multi generational incest-abused children with Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) for its genetic mind-control studies.

To create this \"superior race\", Byrd believed in the Nazi and KKK principles of \"annihilation of underprivileg ed races and cultures\" through genocide, to alter genetics and breed the more gifted - the blondes of this world'.

It is extraordinary that the entirely separate research by this Author, which carefully sought to by-pass and initially to discount the work of Mark Phillips and Cathy O'Brien, because of the unanswered questions that have been alluded to, has culminat-ed in exactly the same conclusion. The separate investigations in other Chapters of this book leave no room for doubt that Nazi 'Black' Intellig ence has successfully leveraged its occult dimension, through systematic influence-building, penetration and the creation of an identity of purpose within US intelligence, as an instrument of Nazi global hegemony strategy. Put another way, the Illuminati fulfil the function of an occultic cover for German intelligence - which is directed by the secret DVD from a town that is sy nonymous with the mass production of death: Dachau. An impeccable, and knowledgeable, US inte lligence source has separately confirmed the accuracy of this assessment. This Author knows, from an intelligence source, that the Pope receives a briefing from the Vatican's CIA Rezident every Friday afternoon. Not least, since Cathy O'Brien traces early stages of her traumatised childhood to abuses inflicted upon her by her Catholic schoolteachers, she and Phillips have concluded that 'the CIA and the Vatican are the Illuminati'. Indeed Rome has been a central lo cus of Illuminism since Grand Master (33rd Degree) Giuseppe Mazzini, a revolutionary terro rist leader, Sicilian gangster, drug-dealer and the founder of the Mafia - a man who authorised thefts, arson and the poisoning of his opponents - divided responsibility for the control of the World Revolution with Albert Pike - taking responsibility for political operati ons, which were to be directed from Rome. The Vatican is the seat of the 'Beast-Lamb' - that is to say, translating John's inspired prophetic vision into our own perceptions, of the man whose number is 666, who stands in the place of Jesus Christ, and who presides over a place where, as Dr Malachi Martin personally told the Author, 'people are not nice at all'. ■ NAZI CONNECTIONS IN FU LL WASHINGTON DAYLIGHT Paul Weyrich, operative founder of the Heritage Foundation, a Melkite Greek Catholic, has a background with ties to Nazi collaborators. In the 1970s, Weyrich helped arrange appointments and political contacts on Capitol hill for Dr Franz- Josef Strauss, of Bavaria, who assisted Nazi collaborators. Dr Roger Pearson, writer and organiser for the Nazi Northern League, joined the editorial board of 'Policy Review', the monthly Heritage Foundation publication, in 1977. Dr Pearson's racist theories have been circulated worldwide by neo-Nazi and White-supremacist organisations. Pearson was brought to the United States by Willis Carto, the operative founder of the neo-Fascist Institute for Historical Review (Holocaust denial) and the Liberty Lobby which published the anti-Semitic 'Spotlight' newspaper, now succeeded by 'American Free Press'. The British Eugenics Society had this ment ion of Roger Pearson on its website: 'Hans K. Gunther, a Nazi anthropologist and eugenicist... was assisted by Dr Roger Pearson of the Eugenics Society, an important figure on the racist journal, 'Mankind Quarterly'. [This] racist journal was still pumping out venom [as of 1994], still influenced by Dr Roger Pearson.

It is pertinent t hat this book was published in Las Vegas, where con siderable high-level US intelligence resources are devoted to th e creation of disinformation films, videos and other media, including the ridiculous footage purportedly showing Osama Bin Laden (the CIA's 'former' asset Tim Osman) in a bathrobe on some moonscape or other. However, much of the information in this privately-published work, the cover of which is illustrated on page 225, is consistent with the entirely independent research conducted by the Author and his colleagues. Specifically, the Author has identified and publicised docu mented evidence of colossal funding operations that have been undertaken independent of governments, raising in 1989-92 an initial $27.5 trillion (which exceeded $65 trillion by the third quarter of 2006I ostensibly for the financing of the so-called Global Security Environment, linked to the Global Security Project headed by Mikhail Gorbachev in the early 1990s. Followin g the framing of the US Go vernment Trustor of these funds, crooked US intelligence officers, intelligence crime family 'barons' and international banks made liberal use of the funds, until the Trustor, whom the CIA had said was 'dead', 'came to life' in 2005. O'Brien and Phillips (who are married) cite, on page 78 of their book, the following accurate statement by Senator Daniel Inouye (Democrat, Hawaii), which inde pendently confirms that the Author's giga-financial researches into the funding of the llluminati's New Underworld Order have been correctly focused. Referring to the New Underworld Or der apparat as a 'secret government', he described it as follows before a Senate Subcommittee: ft is 'a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fund-raising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of 'national interest', free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself. Senator Inouye's description indicated that he saw the 'shadow governmenf as a US phenomenon: but it is in fact a Shadow International Government - the secret structure of the llluminati. 2.

It first emerged as a sub- ideology from the activities of the Frankfurt School, fo rmerly the Institute of Social Research, which was established at Frankfurt University in Germany in 1923, and was relocated to New York City in 1934 1 . By the end of the Second World War, most of the orig inal members of the Frankfurt School had become American citizens, a development which 'opened a new English-speaking audience for focusing on American forms of authoritarianism 2 . From 1930 onwards, the leading members of the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer, Adorno, Fromm and the French philosopher Marcuse, laboured to translate Marxism from economic into cu ltural terms, which they mainly achieved by crossing Marx with Freud 3 . Parallel work and thinking wa s being undertaken at the same time by Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Communist, who was to be incarcerated for nine years under Mussolini. The leading members of the Frankfurt School were all Jewish. The first poisonous doctrine developed by the Fran kfurt School was 'Critical Theory', the basis for the pretentious 'politically correcf 'studies' depa rtments in American Universities. The Institute subsequently developed its so-called 'studies in prejudice'. These manipulative studies, notably as developed in Adorno's influential book 'The Authoritarian Personality', argued for the Revolution that anyone who defended or adhered to traditional Western culture and morality had a psychological problem. It is a well-known characteristic of the 'crimina l' mentality that the perpetrator of a given trespass seizes every opportunity of accusing others of committing the same offence, in order to mask his or her own trespass. Yet the 'PC mentality has itself developed a category of offence which the PC mind is apt to condemn, in knee-jerk fashion, as 'finger-pointing' or 'type-casting' 4 . Both accusations prejudge the thinking and intentions of the accused, and theref ore reveal prejudice in the mind of the 'politically correct' individual who purports to object to language employed by the accused. It can of course never be the PC perpetrator who has a psychological problem - wh ich is of course the reve rse of the truth. Once again, 'political correctness' turns the truth inside out and upside down. That is its Luciferian revolutionary purpose. 'Political correctness' disp lays the classical hallmark of all Luciferian ideologies, in that it 'demands that people live a lie' 5 . In fact, 'political correctness' demands that we must all accept in innumerable lies as the truth. Such lies include the revolutionary egalitarian assertions that men and women are interchangeable; that there are no differences between or among races or ethnic groups (when these groups are taken as wholes, as 'political correctness' requires, so that its lies in this co ntext are based upon empty generalisations); or that homosexuality is normal and perfectly acceptable. As one analyst has explained, the unholy PC trinity that 'political correctness' demands that we bow down and worship consists of racism, sexism and homophobia 6 . The same veteran American intelligence observer an d activist, Paul Weyrich [see box, page 252] has pointed out that all ideologies lead to coercion, dictatorship and thereafter in all probability to genocide 7 : and in many of his pronouncements, it seems as though they verge upon actual predictions, rather than just warnings. This may be because,' ironically', this opera tive came from a Melkite Greek Catholic background rich with links to Nazi collaborators and neo-Fascis t organisations, so he would have known what he was talking about. One of his handlers was an operative called William Lind, described as 'very condescending and arroganf by one observer, who also said that Lind gave the impression of being 'an ageing Brownshirt'. The reason for the tendency towards dictatorship implied by Weyrich was that ideology is bound to fail - pending the procurement of definitive methods of forcing the whole of humanity to think alike (which the Illuminati are heavily engaged in seek ing, but which cannot be achieved). For, since we are all wonderfully made, we are all, each one of us, miraculously different (which was what the Lord intended). Hence none of us naturally thinks in th e same way; and the high priests of 'political correctness' know this perfectly well - which means that they fundamentally know that they are liars. In other words, ideologies presuppose that the st ate or supranational ent ity (in the contemporary context) must adopt them as official ideologies, so that they become enforceable, and are enforced, by"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 255 the state. This is where ideology leads because in the end there is no way to compel people to bow down to and accept lies except by threats of coercion, leading to the concentration camps and the GULAG. The term that the promoters of 'political correctness ' apply to any open defiance of its revolutionary mandates is 'hate' - illustrating that like all ideologies, 'political correctness' has developed its own 'Newspeak'. Anyone who defies any ideology is, as noted, suffering from a psychol ogical problem - that is to say, he is 'nuts'. Hence, of course, the notorious usage of 'psychiatric hospitalisation' in the overt Soviet Union, and to a considerable extent in the United Stat es, as a routine method of ensuring that those who are deemed to have erred in their attitude or thinking ar e 'brought to reason' - a practice which has continued without interruption into the false 'post'-Soviet era. Nor are overt and covert Communist regimes alone guilty of this profound evil today. On the contrary, the use of 'lunacy testing' and other 'psychiatric coercion' techniques is commonplace in the American military, in the intelligence community where handlers decide that their operative needs to be neutralised, as well as throughout the United St ates' penitent iary system, which in many respects carries a close resemblance to the Soviet GULAG. Even so, it was the Soviets who were the first to reveal the central importance of 'political cor- rectness' to the Luciferian Revolution, and to emphasise formally its intentionally coercive purpose. The pertinent pronouncement appeared in the primary co mpendium of Lenin's version of the dialectical Revolution entitled 'The Foundations of Marxism-Leni nism', a compendium first compiled under Stalin and revised and updated after his death. In this document, it was affirmed that 'in deciding other affairs, methods of public influence, the influence of public opinion, will be utilised. Under Communism, public opinion will become a mighty force, capable of bringing to reason those individuals who might not want to follow Communist customs and rules of behaviour of the Community' 8 . It is important to recall that the overt Soviets were in the habit of publishing their revolutionary prescriptions as though they applied primarily to the Soviet Union and its satellite s. In practice, the prescriptions developed and approved for 'domestic' public consumption were like wise sanctioned for international application: thus the essay in which this passage appeared was entitled 'Marxism-Leninism as a Philosophy and World Outlook'. The Illuminati, being schooled and steeped in the occult, have always recognised that the achievement of the global hegemony after which they lust - which has become an international cooperative endeavour that serves (and this is crucial) the German long-range strategy - depends upon their mastery over and control of the human mind. In 1920, the British Amy General J. F. C. Fuller, pronounced farsightedly that the traditional methods of military warfare would be 'replaced by purely psychological warfare, wherein weapons are not used or battlefields sought... But [rather]... the corruption of the human reason, the dimming of the human intellect, and the disint egration of the moral and spiritual life of one nation by the influence and will of another is accomplished' 9 . The Nazi International, and thei r contributing mentors from the Frankfurt School, fully understood that corruption of 'the enemy', by all means to hand, given that for them 'the war never ended' [see Chapter 8], necessitated controlling his mental processes. Lenin, the German Abwehr operative, had exactly the same understanding, as was acknowledged by B. H. Liddell Hart, who wrote: 'Lenin had a vision of fundamental truth when he said that \"the soundest strategy in war is to postpone operations until the moral disintegration of the enemy renders the delivery of the mortal blow both possible and easy\". This is not always practicable, nor his methods of propaganda (to include sophistry, strategic deception, and strategic self-deception) always fru itful. But it will bear adaptation: 'The soundest strategy in any campaign is to postpone battle, and the soundest tactics to postpone attack, until the moral dislocation of the enemy renders the delivery of a decisive blow practicable' 10 . In the passage taken from 'Marxism-Leninism as a Philosophy and World Outlook', the emphasised words 'bringing to reason' reveal the coercive intent underlying revolutionary 'political correctness'. The Illuminist Revolution has no hope of ultimate survival, let alone of triumph world-wide, if it cannot first achieve control over our minds, and assure itself that this control will remain permanent: which of course it can never achieve, which is why revolutions go 'round and r ound in circles' (the revealingly literal demonic meaning of the word 'revolution'). Transferred to the United States because of the prospect of Nazi harassment of its Jewish mem-"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"256 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler bership, the Frankfurt School took care to re-invent auth oritarianism so that it did not, at least for the time being, resemble its European counterpart. Instead of applying the threat of terror and physical and mental coercion, the Frankfurt School now attempted to enforc e conformity of thinking by more gentle means. According to Martin Jay, the most effective of these were to be found in the cultural field. American mass culture thus became one of the central concerns of the Frankfurt School' 11 . In fact, Lenin and Trotsky realised almost from the outset that theatre and film, popular transmission mechanisms of popular culture, had to be brought under reliable revolutionary control, just as Lenin laid down that the press needed to be at the Revolution's service at all times - a lesson that the CIA has learned and has applied with gusto. In the course of a 'spooks' cruise' off the West Coast in 2003, a 'fly on the wall' reporting to the Author revealed that the senior US intelligence officers on board we re particularly proud of their achievement in controlling the press. They have also sought to control the Internet, spawning a large number of deliberately contradictory Information Warfare agitprop websites. An American student of the Frankfurt School wrote in 1976 that'... there was a meeting of American scholars at a conference on religious and racial prejudice in 1944. Over the next five years, a Frankfurt School team under th e direction of Max Horkheimer conducted in-depth social and psychological profiles of Americans under the mentioned project entitled 'Studies of Prejudice'. One of the results was a book entitled 'The Author itarian Personality' by Theodor Adorno, et al, that summarised one of the largest public opinion surveys ever undertaken in the United States. It was published in 1950, and conformed to the original Critical Theory in every respect. As a document that testified to the belief system of the Frankfurt School revolutionaries, it was esse ntially anti-God, anti-Christian, anti-family, anti- nationalist, anti-patriot, anti-conservative, anti-hereditarian, anti-ethnocentric, anti-masculine, anti- tradition and anti-morality. All of these are elements inherent in Critical Theory' 12 , which owes much to the Jewish authors' infestation with the occult mumbo-jumb o of the Kabbalah. The ostensible objective of the Frankfurt School's ac tivities and research in the United States was much more subtle than had been the case in Europe. Their new, US-oriented purpose was education for tolerance, rather than praxis for revolutionary change. Having studied American liberal thought and attitudes carefully, they cleverly adapted their revolutionary rhetoric to suit and merge with the mainstream of liberal Left thought in America, while maintaining intact their cultural Marxist objectives. Their language now came to match more closely the li beral (i.e., socialist)'... New Deal rather than Marxist or radical language' 13 . But of course toleration was in fact the reverse of wh at the Frankfurt School was promoting. Yet, as Dr Gerald L. Atkinson has written, 'the non-authoritarian (utopian) person ality, insofar as it was defined, was posited as a person with a non-dogmatic tolerance fo r diversity. This thought is dominant in today's Boomer generation, the New Totalitarians' 14 . And of course by the end of the century, 'diversity' was the watchword of all US and UK 'politically correct' thinking, having invaded the boardrooms of American and British industry, whence it permeated organisations of all kinds from the highest levels of management to the workforce. A certain US transportation utility spent millions of dollars in the late 1990s and into the new century on elaborate programmes to indoctrinate and brainwash the workforce, introducing one the Frankfurt School's gems - 'affirmative action' - everywhere. In practice what this meant was that whenever a vacancy arose, no matter how qualified a Caucasian candidate for the post might be, preference was always given to the disadvantaged from an ethnic background. As one wag cynically put it, 'if you are an illiterate female Black dwarf who has served nine years in a penitentiary for drug abuse, you may be just the person we're looking for to head up our new public relations department'. Though this 'politically incorrecf example is exaggerated of course, and perhaps offensive to some, such upside-down 'thinking' is much less unusual in American industry and in the employment market generally, than the objective observer may believe. This kind of perversity has brought forth the phenomenon of 'attitude' (or 'attitood'), displayed so often by store assistants, servers etc, whose focus is upon what the customer says and believes (which such people arrogantly assume), than upon providing the requis ite and expected standard of service. It is also consistent with Wundtian 'Outcome-Bas ed Education' which postulates that it is not what the pupil learns that matters, it is his or her 'attitude'. Provided the child or teenager has been sufficiently indoctrinated in the norms of 'political correctness' - for example, to equate animals with humans ('animals rights') or to accept without question the wholly inaccurate assertion that the"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 257 resources of 'the planet' (a 'politically correct', revolutionary environmentalist key-word) are finite, findings such as that the child cannot spell or write a coherent sentence in English and has learned next to nothing (even though what he or she is supposed to have been taught conformed strictly to the anti- nation state 'politically correct' collectivist agenda), are disregarded. What matters is that the child has the right 'politically correcf attitude. This aberrant I lluminati-sponsored abuse of education has spread far beyond the United States to the other main English-speaking countries. 'Cultural Marxism' and the dumbing-down of the higher faculties of man through provocatively sensate or affective miseducation and the blanket infliction of decadent, Satanic popular 'music' upon the population, as preached by the Frankfurt School in the United States, have created a partial mental 'tabula rasa' in the confused minds of glaz ed-eyed, targeted youth, preparing the way for and spawning knee-jerk responses to 'prejudice', 'bigotry' and 'discrimination'. These platforms preceded the destructive concepts of 'affirmative action', 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism' which are now dominant in American and British society, and within the bureaucra tic structures of both countries. Such mental aberrations are the direct descendants of the Institute's study in the 1940s of 'anti- semitism', by which was meant anti-Communism and 'discrimination' (by which was meant in turn support for capitalism). It was that 'study' which inserted the language of 'civil rights' (quite recently joined by 'civil society'), 'discrimina tion', 'women's rights', 'children's righ ts', and other minority 'rights' into mainstream American and, after an interval, into British 'culture'. The situation has long been reached in both countries in which care has to be taken not to 'ups et' the 'feelings' of minorities, when in comparable situations the sensibilities of the majority Caucasians would never be a factor. What is the underlying point of all this garbag e, apart from being an exercise in mass mind- manipulation and control? A key point that has gone unnoticed is that, since the Illuminati strive to obliterate 'religion' (by which they mean the Torah and True Christianity: the false religions, they use), the resulting intended mental 'tabula rasa' is replicated by a spiritual vacuum, as well. So the inculcation of what the supreme Illuminist Mikhail Gorbachev proclaims to be 'common human values' is intended to replace the personal spiritual relationship that the True Christian enjoys with God: for, since the Illuminati are not atheists, but understand very well that spiritual forc es exist, they seek to ensure that the forces in 'common usage' are those provided by their god Lucifer, rather than by God himself. Moreover the resulting general acceptance of this tripe (especially among the young, who have been deprived of access to True Christianity, for instan ce) provides lucrative new opportunities for making money. Thus trashy pop stars and are easily hired to appear in Hyde Park, Central London, in the 'touchy-feely' presence of Tony Blair and this 'licensed' hippie, 'Sir' Bob Geldof, to 'promote' 'aid for Africa' and 'poverty reduction'. The 'Useful Idiots' who contribute to such mass Psy-Ops events by buying tickets or sending relief funds, have no means of veri fying what happens to their money after it has been collected. If they knew that such events were usually massive scamming operations, the scales might fall from their bleary, befogged and misguided eyes. As the American analyst Raymond V. Raehn has explained, 'Critical Theory' as applied mass psychology has led [in particular] to the radical deconstruction of gender in the American culture. Critical Theory required the distinction between masculinity and femininity to disappear. The traditional roles of mothers and fathers were to be dissolved, so that patriarchy w ould be ended. Children are not to be raised according to their biological differences, but should be free to move in and out of existing genders and gender roles, according to their own 'preferences. This reflects the Frankfurt School rationale for the disintegration of the traditional family' 15 which was 'necessary' in order to create the preconditions for a wholesale attack on private property. Property represents power, and the persistence of power centres other than in the hands of the Illuminist elite, is not to be permitted. The Frankfurt School's perverted alumni preached that '... even a partial breakdown of parental authority in the family might tend to increase the re adiness of a coming genera tion to accept social change' 16 . 'Change' is of course a primary keyword of the Revolution, and is routinely used without elaboration - that is to say, its terms are never defined. Whenever the wo rd change is used with no indication of what it means (change from what and to what?), its use and purpose is inte ntionally deceptive and revolutionary. The 'politically correct', indoctrinated revolutionary or unwitting 'U seful Idiot' accepts all 'change' as being by definition desirable, and is trained not to waste time questioning what 'changes' are intended, or where they may lead. As indica ted, the Revolution reveals both the weakness"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"258 C HAPTER 4: The Hex of Himmler of its intellectual underpinnings and its deceptive nature by routinely failing to define its terms, and by shrinking from spelling out what the end-result of 'change' is intended to be. Its actives fear to do so, knowing perfectly that if their true revolutionary intentions were known, the coerced support upon which they rely would all but evaporate overnight. Finally, we need to consider briefly the relevance of Jewish 'mysticism' as a factor in the subversive formulations of members of the Fra nkfurt School. Since all crit icism of Jews by Gentiles is liable to be labelled anti-semitic, the most appropriate way to a ddress the Judaic characteristics of the Frankfurt School is to rely upon criticism by a Jewish author and expert. The most helpful examination of the Jewishness of the Frankfurt School is perhaps to be fo und in an essay entitled 'Georg Lukacs and the Frankfurt School: A Case of Secular Messianism ', examining the contribution of one of the Institute's leading 'lights', Georg Lukacs, by Joseph B. Maier 17 . In this important essay, the Jewish author acknowledged that German Jewry was preoccupied with the mysticism of the Kabbalah, which of cour se is derived from pagan Babylon and denies the existence of any absolute truth. On the contrary, there are, according to one of the Frankfurt School's most important (though not self- admitted) teachers, Walter Benjamin, innumer able variations on any given theme. This utterly Talmudic approach he expressed in the following memorable statement: 'I have never been able to do research and think in a way other than, if I may so put it, in a theoretical sense - namely, in accordance with the Talmudic teaching of the forty-nine levels of meaning in every passage of the Torah' 18 . What this reveals is that, for these people, revolution - going round and round in circles - is Talmudic: for there are no absolutes, only interpreta tions. That is precisely the trap that the Nazi International's greatest project, th e European Union Collective, has se t for the ignorant and unwary non- German Goyim who have accepted that strategic deception device for th e usurpation of national sovereignty, as genuine. In the EU context, there are no fixed truths: everything is debatable, transitory, arguable, temporary, contradicted, ephemeral, or expendable. That just happens to be the essence of Leninism, which has no values except 'the revolution' itself: that is to say, that 'going round and round in circles' is an end in itself. Lenin, as we have repeatedly seen, was a German-hired subversion operative, so it is no surprise that his mad, Talm udic ideas correspond precisely with t hose promulgated by the Frankfurt School, which coexisted with Nazism in Germany, and has prepared the ground for the Thousand-Year Reich to be erected on the ruins of the United States. As for why Jews collaborate de facto with Nazis, this mystery is resolved when one understands that Zionism is Jewish Fascism. ■ Chapter 4: The Hex of Himmler: ADDENDUM: The Frankfurt School 1.

However in the minds of the deranged 'Useful Idiots' who have fallen for this idolatry and have made a pact with him, or who seek, whether knowingl y or not, to do so, there is an important distinction. Satanists, mentally deranged by the use and abuse of drugs, accuse the Lord God (of Christians) of having betrayed humanity. Th ey are not atheists, but openly acknowledge and recognise that their god, Satan, occupies a position super-naturally which, equipped with the 'magickal' powers that they claim to be able to mobilise in response to what they know about the 'Ancient Mysteries', they conspire to evoke - often raising demonic spirits which turn the tabl es and possess them instead. By contrast the Luciferians, initiates of kindred occult rites and of course labouring under strange delusions - because, as discussed earlier, the Being they worship is the king and author of lies and murder - deliberately place Lucifer at the top of their agenda, go about their evil business driven by his 'seeth ing powers', and glorify him as the principle of all that is 'good'. In other words, being idio ts and deluded idolaters, they have fallen for Satan's 'reversal' lie - that good is evil, and evil is good, as Satan, masquerading as the serpent, beguiled Eve in the Garden of Eden. To Luciferians, he is the equal of Our Lord (Adonay), whom they describe as the principle of evil - because He stands in the way of their motto (as expressed by the Satanic Illuminati sect called Ordo Templi Orientis): 'Do as thou wilt'. You want that woman? Take her. You want casual sex? Grab it. You covet that man's assets? Raid them. Accuse him unjustly; deploy false witness against him. Have him flung into jail. You want Iraq's oil? Seize it. Luciferians have 'risen' (i.e. descended) via initiation to the level at which they have exchanged normal human sensibilities, sensitivity and emotion, for a 'higher (= lower) calling', in which they take great pr ide, devoid of all normal human emotion (which is actually spiritual death). The 'risi ng' Mason who is 'progr essing upwards' (i.e., descending) towards the state of 'perfect understa nding' as he is initiated serially into ever more demonic grossness and gobbldegook, acquire s tell-tale ch aracteristics which can be recognised as distinct from those of normal human beings. George Bush Sr., for instance, displays a patrician aloofness and deadness which is typical of such deluded personalities. One of the geomasons' most celebrated authors, Manly P. Hall, describes precisely, in \"The Lost Keys of Freemasonry' [1923] 1 , what the 'requirements' of high Masonry are supposed to be. It should be noted that each sentence in what follows needs to be read as a whole: if parts of a sentence are extracted out of context, the incorrect impression is given. For instance, in the first paragraph, 'simplicity with its accompanying power' fol-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"260 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer lows 'kindness in the face of unkindness'. Simp licity, in the Christian and True Judaic perception is not accompanied by power, but is rather a prerequisite for divine acceptance by itself. In Hall's description of the twisted and deformed 'mature' Masonic personality that emerges from the first th ree (deliberately decep tive) Degrees (the Blue Degrees), all emotions are to be suppressed and overlaid w ith a cold air of innate superiority. The 'calmness' of the 'higher' Mason is derived from the fact that his soul is dead and his heart is stone cold. Since this is the condition into which the initiate is intended to emerge from the first three (Blue) Degrees only, just imagine what a frozen heart initiates of the 'higher' (= lower) Degrees are ordained to acquire. This illuminates the late Fr. Malachi Martin's statement that Luciferians a nd Satanists 'have all passed through in a sense and that involves three things: the infliction of pain without flinching, the infliction of death without flinching, and the use of fire'. In the following excerpts from Manly P. Hall's treatise, lies and reprobate occult advice are represented as desirable: 'The following requirements are necessary befo re the student can spiritually say that he is a member of the Ancient and A ccepted Rite of the Fellow Craft: 1. The mastery of emotional outbreaks of all kinds, poise under trying conditions, kindness in the face of unkindness, and simplicity with its accompanying power. These points show that the seeker is worthy of being taught by a Fellow [witch]Craftsman. 2. The mastery of the animal energies, the curbing of passion and desire, and the control of the lower nature 2 mark the faithful attempts on the part of the student to be worthy of the Fellow Craft. [This deceitfully suggests that candidates are supposed to lead upright and chaste lives as their superiors do: they don't, and neither do their superiors, given the sexual orientation of Masonic ritual and symbolism. But pagan priesthoods purported to be celibate, in order to falsely enhance their 'standing' among the credulous populace - a base negation of human nature that has been disastrously perpetuated by the Roman Catholic Church]. 3. The understanding and mastery of the creative forces 3 [i.e. connecting with demonic forces: see below], the consecration of them to the unfolding of the spiritual nature, and a proper understanding of their physical application, are necessary steps at this stage of the student's growth. [This is all about 'taming' and 'connecting with' or invoking the 'seething powers of Lucifer': again, see below]. 4. The transmutation of personal affection in to impersonal compassion shows that the Fellow Craftsman truly understands his duties and is living in a manner worthy of his order. Personalities cannot bind the true Se cond Degree member, for having raised one point of the compasses he now realises that all personal manifestations are governed by impersonal principles. 5. At this point the candidate consecrates the fi ve senses to the study of human problems [i.e. not the things of the Lord: this is 'humanism', plus a slow-motion advancement towards demonic infestation - Ed.] with the unfolding of sense centers as the motive; for he realises that the five senses are keys, the proper applicati on of which will give him material for spiritual transmutation if he will apply them to th e common divisor of analogy... The Entered Apprentice [First Blue Degree] may be term ed a materialistic Degree. The Fellow Craft [Second Blue Degree] is religious and mystical [sic], while the Master Mason [Third Blue Degree] is occult or philosophical [sic]. Each of these is a Degree in the unfoldment of a connected life and intelligence, revealing in ever fuller expression the gradual liberation of the Master from the triangular cell of threefold negation which marks the early stage of individualization' 4 ."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 261 THE BLUE DEGREES ARE THREE SIDES OF AN OCCULT TRIANGLE So, the first three (lowest) Degrees [see Figure 44 on page 263], the so-called Blue Degrees - hence the widespread application of blue as a symbol of Masonic affiliation, for instance as the colour of the United Nations, the background to the esoteric European Union flag, or as the colour employed by IBM, or 'Big Blue' - are three sides of a triangle, which of course is a primary occult symbol of the Kabbalah. In Manly P. Hall's book, 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry', on the page facing the preceding paragraph, is an illustration of the initiate standing atop the truncated pyramid with his arms outstretched and in his left hand a Tau Cross (a cross with a circle above the cross-beam), which is the Crux Ansata, representing the union of male and female = fecundity [see Figure 45 on page 265]. The caption beneath that picture reads, in the original: 'The Master Mason, having completed his labors [in the Blue Degrees - Ed] becomes a worker on a higher plane than the one in which the ordinary builder is permitted to work'. So the labourers in the 'Blue' Degrees - 'the blue canopy of the Masonic L odge', as Hall describes them on page 61 of his book - are 'ordinary workers' who, as we have seen, are deceived as to the real nature and purpose of Masonry: they represent the vast bulk of the pyramid, from the base up to where it is truncated - as shown on the US $1.0 dollar note, emblem of the Illuminati that Americans use for small purchases without the majority of them having the slightest clue that the note they proffer to the sales person carries images symbolic of this Satanic nexus of cults called Freemasonry [Figure 53, page 334]. And only a select few Americans seem able to gras p that the single eye on the dollar bill, which is replicated from the Great Seal of the United Stat es, is in fact the evil 'All-Seeing Eye' eye of Lucifer [Figure 54, page 335: see Figure 47 on page 281 for the occult Masonic images on both sides of the Great seal of the United States]. When ordinary uncompromised Americans willingly place their opened right hand across the left breast to hear or to sing the National Anthem, they are unwittingly performing the Sign of Fellow Cr aft (viz., the Second Blue Degree) without due guard [see Addendum 10, Figure G, page 737]. Once he is a Master Mason, a candidate is eligible, if selected, to move on up (i.e., down, of course) the much more rarefied ladder of occultic initiations shown in Figure 44 on page 263, which entice the adept towards the worship of Lucifer and to learn some elements of the sorcery and magick of the 'Ancient Mysteries' of Egypt and Babylon, including instructions on how to summon up demons and the Devil himself (in the Rosicrucian tradition). Even so, all those who embark upon these 'higher' initiation stages, are routinely tricked by their superiors, since all Works of Darkness deceive those who indulge in them. Already, the naive 'Useful Idiots' who have embarked upon the so-called 'Blue Degrees' are being purposefully deceived by their peers; for Masonry is a Cult of Darkness that deceives its fellow Masons about the true meaning of its mad symbols and esoteric rituals. That brazen ly ing is of the essence, was made crystal clear by the Patriarch of modern American and 'world' Scottish R ite and Palladian Freemasonry, the sorcerer and necromancer, Albert Pike, when he specifically explained in his tome 'Morals and Dogma' that... The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine [that] he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry....

Masonry is the veritable Sphinx...' 5 . The offensive and sterile cultur e of lies and deception, of the double-cross and of 'bait and switch', which is the norm in US and other intelligence circles, is derived explicitly from this institutionalised geomasonic tradition of deception. Hobbled by compartmentalisation, US intelligence opera tives may be proficient and effective in whatever vineyard of sour grapes they live and have their deluded being, but they have no idea at any given moment who is deceiving them among the intelligence community and sub-community to which they belong - let alon e who of their foreign contacts is liable to scam and double-cross them. Th ese people forfeit true friendships and normal human relationships for the temporary buzz and lif elong uncertainty characteristic of the castle of lies and dirty tricks in which th ey live; and they know that if they 'mess up', they are very likely to be set up, abandoned, or otherwise abused by the ruthless, cold-hearted machine to which they belong. When they target people unconnected with intelligence, they usually blow their cover - because having emerged fro m the darkness, they have no idea how to function in broad daylight. This hellish environment reflects the fact that all intelligence organisations are essentially esoteric secret societies, impregnated with Masonry and therefore Illuminism and, in the case of the CIA and certa in other leading intelligence networks, fatally compromised by their compulsive meddling with the occult. Notwithstanding that all Freemasons are deceived by their peers, 'Blue Masonry' Degrees purport to inculcate the Lesser Mysterie s of the Ancients, wher eby only the exoteric doctrines were revealed. All subsequent De grees, which cannot be accessed unless one has passed through the Blue Degrees, and is invited to 'go on higher', inculcate the supposed 'Greater Ancient Mysteries', incorporati ng Babylonian-Talmudic Kabbalism with the 'Egyptian Mysteries'. On initiation, Masons receive an alias by which name they are henceforth known in the Lodge, as is the case with The Order of Skull and Bones. All Masonry contradicts the Word of Jesus Christ by su bstituting 'help a brother Mason' for the Christian teaching that one should love one's neighbour as oneself, which means helping everyone as necessary, without distinction. The Brotherhood is not the Brotherhood of Man (the whole of Mankind) but of Men (the Illuminati). MASONIC 'LIFE' 'ABOVE' THE BLUE DEGREES The occult initiation stages that may follow passage through the three lowest Degrees of both the Scottish and York Rites of 'Anglo-Saxon' Freemasonry, are all metaphorically crammed within the approach to the 'capstone', i.e., they form the building blocks of the final courses of the Great Pyramid (of Egypt, th e Biblical metaphor for the Darkness and the 'Mysteries' of which, as Manly P. Hall clai ms on pages 102-103 of 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry' 6 , are 'progenitors of modern Freemasonry'). Certain of the 'highest' Illuminati celebrated the millennium at an occult rite at the Great Pyramid -their number reportedly including the alleged controlling Deutsche Ve rteidigungs Dienst agents George Bush (Busche) Sr. and Dr Henry Kissinger. Senior German operatives are conspicuous within the higher ranks, where German is routinely spoken. By the time that Lady Queenborough (Edith Starr Miller), the greate st lay investigator of Freemasonry, was completing her research in the early 1930s, it had become apparent that for any career in the financial sector , membership of a Lodge was an absolute prerequisite 7 .

It is rife, believe it or not, in the reprobate Church of England and other British churches, notably the Church of Scotland and the Presbyterian Church of Wales - which is of course a contradiction in terms, and is de rigeur in local government (which is extremely corrupt in Britain) and to a considerable extent in Whitehall. Masonic initiation is also secretly prevalent, as in the United States, throughout the intelligence community and politics, although UK Members of Parliament are forbidden by their House rules to shake hands with other Freemasons within the precincts of the Pal ace of Westminster. The rationale for this is likely to be an earlier attempt to frustrate Masonic practice, in which brother Masons go to their brother Masons' aid to the exclusion of other considerations. However a former MP has told the Author personally that many of his colleagues would disappear in the evenings for no known reason, gathering for private meetings in the precincts of the House, without ever in viting someone known not to be a Mason into their gatherings, or explaining the reason fo r their frequent absences. Masonry of course wastes a colossal amount of a person's lifetime, so Masonic activity must likewise wreak havoc in a politician's life, given that all politicians are deliberately worked to the bone (so that they have as little time to think and take in the 'larger picture', as can be arranged) 8 . Particularly insidious is the Speculative Society of Edinburgh, to which politicians, judges, police and other members of the control system belong. Freemasons deny that this clearly Masonic secret society has anything to do with Masonry: but as lies are the norm in this milieu, this is meaningless. Indicative of the corrupting influence of Masonry among British country solicitors is the following description by the late Stephen Knight, author of The Brotherhood, who, like Mozart, died suddenly and mysteriously (shortly after his book appeared in 1984): 'The Law Society is one of the most Masonic institutions in the world.... A great many of the sixty-odd members of the Law Society Council as well as a high proportion of the Society's staff and committees: 90% of all male staff above the age of thirty are Freemasons. ... I have thousands of papers on one case... so well docume nted that it can be followed in minute detail. It involves one of the many Masonic members of the Law Society Council, who had personally committed an act of gross negligence which caused one of his clients to lose a £100,000 inheritance. Deliberate action on the part of several other firms of Masonic solicitors - some of the biggest names in the legal profession - acting in collusion with the original solicitor and with each other to cover up the negligence, brought the client to the edge of financial ruin. Having mortgaged his home, spent £15,000 in legal fees to lawyers who deliberately ignored his instructions, wasted valuable time and generated hundreds and hundreds of expensive, unnecessary documents, he was forced to apply to the Law Society, of which his chief opponent was an influential member, for legal aid. Finally, in 1982, after fighting Masonic manipulation of the legal syst em for more than a year, and only after a direct appeal to a senior and non-masonic official in the Department of Health and Social Security, which works in tandem with the Law Society on legal aid applications, he was granted a legal aid certificate - but on extremely onerous conditions' 9 ."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" Figure 45: The Masonic candidate standing on top of the symbolic incomplete py ramid, which Alber t Pike described, with no explanation and without elaboration, as 'the universal symbol of immo rtality' ['Morals and Dogma', page 633].

It is quite extraordinary that the paragraph in question contains a lie, or a denial of the geometry of the pyramid. Specifically, Albert Pike, who has just textually revered the Triangle with its three sides, now writes: 'For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the triangular base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or summit'.

As a result of the newly appointed London solicitor's inter- vention, all the country firms' earlier endless obstructive tactics suddenly ceased. As for the UK intelligence services, absurd denials by British intelligence officers in the 1980s that Masonry exists or is rife inside the UK intelligence community, as is the case in the United States, reported in Stephen Knight's The Brotherhood, are belied not least by the occult-masonic MI5 symbol shown in Figure 1 on page 3. In the early 1980s, British intelligence tried to disguise the well-known Masonic influence with which it had always been plagued, given intelligence research that had revealed the likelihood of KGB penetration of the services through Masonic membership, the KGB and DVD having been well aware that the largest secret organisation in Britain has always been Freemasonry. LURE OF MASTERY OF THE 'SEE THING ENERGIES OF LUCIFER' It has been noted that Luciferians (and would-be Luciferian Masons as they 'rise') are, or run the risk of being progressively 'endowed' with, powers to manipulate (as these 'Useful Idiots' come to believe) the 'seething energies of Lucifer'. The source of this knowledge is Manly P. Hall himself, who, routinely uses the name 'God' when in fact he is secretly referring to Lucifer, and who writes as follows in 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry' [lies shown in italics]: 'Man does not listen to that little voice which speaks to him in ever loving ever sorrowful tones. This voice speaks of the p eace accompanying the constructive application of energy which he must chain if he would master the powers of creation' 10 . Here is Satan calling the candidate/initiate, telling him that he can become like a god, which is what is meant by 'master[ing] the powers of creation'. But it gets worse: 'The lost key... is the mastery of emotion, which places the energy of the universe at their disposal. Man can only expect to be entrusted with great power by proving his ability to use it constructively and selflessly. When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mastery of his Craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy. Incessant vigilance over thought, action and desire is indispensable to those who wish to make progress in the unfolding of their own being.... the firm, kind hand of spirit must curb the flaming powers of emotion with an iron grip' 11 . Satan, in the guise of Masonry, is spinning lies to the initiate, first of all, along the lines (in so far as any sense at all can be derived, for in stance, from Manly P. Hall's extremely confused esoteric writings) that Freemasonry is the custodian of the 'Ancient Mysteries' which only the privileged few have ever accessed because onl y the super-initiated have been equipped down the centuries for reaching the level of 'perfection' needed to become imbued with knowledge of them; and that the natural emoti ons, with which we were all endowed by the Lord, as part of our equipment for enjoyment of the life we have been given, are to be suppressed. Anyone believing such garbage needs a head examination; but several m illion dupes worldwide, who have no idea that they are being deceived, walk headlong into this complex Satanic trap, and encumber their lives as they grope vainly in the Darkness for 'enlightenment'.

Is this the norm, because they have been brainwashed into suppressing their natural emotions? What does this mean? Th at a Luciferian Mason no longer loves a woman for her beauty, her grace, her mind, her personality, her spiritual gifts, the incredible unity of her person, the glory of her presence, but uses her for his own filthy self- gratification, and not her alone, but hundred s of others, too? And such behaviour has proliferated far beyond the self -interested Brotherhood - in conformity with the Illuminati's programme for young people from Britain, w ho are debauched by the foul pop culture inflicted on the country by these Luciferian s, and who flock today to the innumerable Bohemian Groves that have sprung up to enti ce them into Satanic activity, and to consume the drugs produced and dist ributed by intelligence 'services'. According to the late Manly P. Hall's sterile and cynically confused assessment and 'promise', the suppression of emotions is the ke y to placing oneself in a position where one will (according to the Masonic blueprint) be 'entrusted with great power'. Having mastered the emotions, the foolish dupe must then learn 'the proper application of the dynamo of living power' - namely, 'the seething energies of Lucifer', which will become his to use and manipulate. And here is the most egregious lie of all: for, far from ultimately procuring the power to manipulate and control 'the seething powers of Lucifer', the adept will be fortunate if he manages to avoid those demonic powers taking hold of him, to some degree. The Satanic deception is embedded in the enticing lie that the candidate will, through initiation, gain the power to control, manipulate, and use to his own advantage, these demonic powers - whereas the outcome will be that the powers assume control of him, as Satan always intends. In such circumstances, he will discover, far too late, that he cannot shake them off without a supreme exercise of his own will, and certainly assistance from a True Christian outside the L odge. And there is no chance of relief without total repentance on the part of the possessed: he has to want to be rescued, and he has to have faith that the Lord Jesus Christ - the onl y name to which Evil Spirit ever responds and pays respect - can rescue him and restore him to normal life. The Masonic (Satanic) lie that Man is capable, exclusively through Masonic in- itiation, of mastering the 'seething energies' of Lucifer, is derived from the heresy of 'Deism', which merges the existence of G od with the false, manmade concept of a mechanistic world. 'Deism' can be encaps ulated in the phrase 'God sleeps', and its esoteric 'magick' symbol is a circle with a diagonal line through it, which is widely used in public places and for modern road signs. Th is doctrine states that 'God, the Supreme Architect of the Universe, created all things, but then isolated himself from the entire creation and let it operate on its own. He fell asleep and hasn't been on top of the situation. This is the very essence of the teachings of Freemasonry' 12 . By means of this deception, celebrating the building of a stone temple and thus rejecting the Lord's statement that the human person is the temple of the Holy Spirit, preserves the idea that 'God' created the world, while inventing a mechanistic world within which the Illuminati/Masonic 'Chosen' assert that th ey are privileged to reorder Man's affairs. This device enables them to face both ways - to be double-minded."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"268 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer IDENTITY OF THE EVIL ONE REVEALED AT FELLOW CRAFT STAGE Even though Manly P. Hall is actually still talking here about what must happen to the initiate of the second lowest Degree (Blue Degr ee), Fellow Craft, he has, as has been seen, already introduced the name of Lu cifer. So in fact it is at th is lowly level, contrary to the received view, that initiates are introduced to Lucifer, or more specifically to the concept of his 'seething energies' (because in the ceremonies, there is no mention of Lucifer until a much higher level is reached). Therefore, in this se nse, fashionable references to the initiation of the candidate into de facto Luciferianism occurring at 'capstone levels' are inaccurate. It is untrue to suggest that the Blue Degrees are basi cally innocuous. On the contrary, even at the Entered Apprentice level, the candidate is told that his tongue will be torn from his mouth, a revoltingly barbaric, Satanic proposition, if he divulges any of the Lodge's secrets. Nevertheless, as the shape of the pyramid below the truncated shelf shows, the vast majority of Masons belong to the three lower Degrees; and as members of Lodges at those levels, while they may delude themselves that Masonry is all about doing good works ('salvation by works') and having pleasant dinners with plenty of wine flowing, and cigars afterwards - with the 'workings' (ritual ceremonies) just a quaint hangover from some mystical past - in reality their minds are alread y being well and truly infected with elements of Satanism, their hearts hardened (because they must suppress their emotions) and their souls polluted with the smoke of the Evil One. Their minds are progressively filled with esoteric nonsense and make-believe, as can be imagined by reviewing the following passage from Manly P. Hall's invented description of the 'seething energies' in question. The reader of this passage (and of Manly P. Hall's book) has every right to conclude that the study and practice of Masonry, as a 33rd Degree initiate, had sent the late pagan Mr Hall completely mad: 'It is strange how divine powers may become perverted until each expression and urge becomes a ruffian and a murderer. The divi ne compassion of the gods manifests in this world of form very differently than in the realms of light. Divine compassion is energised by the same influxes as mortal passions and the lusts of earth. The spiritual rays of Cosmos - the Fire Princes of the Da wn - which seethe and surge through the unregenerate man, are the impulses which he perverts to murder and hate. The ceaseless power of Chaos, the seething spirals of perp etual motion, whose majestic cadences are the music of the spheres, are energized by the same great power that man uses to destroy the highest and the best. The same mystic power that keeps the planets in their orbits around the solar body, the same energy that keeps each electron spinning and whirling, the same energy that is building the Temple of Go d, is now a merciless slave-driver which, unmastered and uncurbed, strikes the Compassionate One and sends him reeling backward into the darkness of his prison'. After this outburst, the maddened Mr Hall starts waffling about 'the Fellow Craft of the Cosmic Lodge' which exists 'to teach mankind the lessons of self-mastery' 13 .

The frontis piece, which was suppressed in later editions, is rich in Masonic symbols. The globalist Albert Einstein wrote, in his classic study 'Mozart, His Character, His Work' [Cassell and Company Limited, London, 1946-1956] that Mozart and his librettist for Di e Zauberflote, Shikaneder, 'were Freem asons: Mozart an enthusiastic one, and Shikaneder surely a crafty and active one. The latter used the symbols of Freemasonry quite openly in the libretto. The first edition of the libretto [of The Magic Flute] contained something rare in such books, two copperplate engravings, one showing Shikaneder-Papageno in his costume of feathers, but the other showing the portal to the 'i nner rooms', the Great Pyramid with hieroglyphics, and a series of emblems: five-pointed star, square and trowel, hour-glass and overthrown pillars and plinths. Everyone understood this. Moza rt took care, by means of rhythm, melody and orchestral colour, to make the significance of the opera, an open secret, still clearer. He began and ended the work in E-flat major, the Masonic key. The slow introduction to the Overture begins with the three chords, symbolising the candidate knocking three times on the portal; and then in t he climactic scene, Tamino knocks on three different doors. A thrice-played chord follows Sarastro's opening of the ceremonies in the temple. Woodwinds - the typical instruments of the Viennese Lodges - play a prominent part'. Yet nine weeks after the first performance of Die Zauberflote, Mozart died a truly wretc hed and painful death - as though, having in e rror celebrated and arguably mocked the 'magick' of the occult, he was duly rewarded with its sole product (death). The eternal mystery is how, given such secular and occult ic preoccupations, Mozart composed some of the most sublime religious music ever written. It was as though his true 'divinely' inspired spirit kept seeking re lease from the worldly oppression of his financially supportive Masonic peers.

Hall himself as 'Ceremonial Magic and Sorcery'. This subversive Rosicrucian publication co ntains the essence of the Zeitgeist of the Illuminati, as conveyed originally from medi aeval Germany to England and Scotland, via France, and then 'back' to Germany. In 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry', the late Mr Hall betrayed signs of having indeed been clean deprived of his senses by such intermeddling and investigations. Rosicrucianism is appended to the Scottish Rite like a limpet, since the assemblers of ritual, sorcery and magick for Fr eemasonry, led by Albert Pike, sought to include all manifestations of such 'ancient devilry', without exception, in their stinking geomasonic cauldron - so that Freemasonry would become the globally acknowledged custodian of the 'Ancient Mysteries' for all eternity. Huge swathes of Masons' private time are take n up with the rituals, meetings, dinners, and learning the verbal tripe that must be recited at 'workings' - time during which they desert their families; at the same time, consid erable financial payments to the Lodge are demanded, which benefit not so much the L odge itself, but the higher echelons of the Masonic pyramid, where luxurious living is the norm. ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRUTH, AND THE NEED TO 'COME OUT' 'Blue Degree' Masons are already, from the outset of their ill-advised collaboration, sitting in the back pews of the House of Lucifer, even though few of them may realise this. Those who manage to wake up before being sucked further into this gradualist diversionary trap for the unwary, should resolve to make the necessary sacrifice and to take decisive early action on the basis of the Apostle Paul's injunction in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 6, verse 17: 'Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you'. But He won't r eceive the Mason while he is touching this unclean thing: no chance. And in Revelation, Chapter 18, verse 4: 'And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, 'Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues'. While the Mason is sitting in the House of Lucifer he is, by definition, susceptible to infections of which he ma y have no immediate know ledge; and when, if ever, he realises what these are, it may be to o late for salvation (although this is never the case, as the Lord's arm is 'stretched out still: 'For all this' [all the serial sins of the children of Israel] 'his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still' [Isaiah, Chapter 5, verse 25]. By which is meant that although the Lord's anger at the person he loves having followed the wrong path, has not been assuaged , yet he is ready with his hand to pull the misguided, opinionated fool away from the course he has embarked upon, and to encourage him to take the right road - towa rds true, as opposed to fake, salvation, and protection from possession by the 'seething energies' of Lucifer. Since we have quoted Isaiah, the greatest of the prophets (a word which can mean 'he who shows the right way'), let us also rejoi ce in his condemnation of these false prophets of Masonry, who preach lies instead of truth, and call them the truth: 'Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight... Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!'

And no marvel; for Satan himself is transforme d into an angel of light' [see Chapter 6]. Therefore it is no great thing if his minister s also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works'. In other words, Masonry, like other false religions, deceitfully represents that it knows the true source of light, and will lead the candidate towards it. This is a false prospectus which anyone who is not sitting on his or her brains should be able to see immediately: for all groups an d societies pledged to secrecy and demanding initiation before 'progress' are false, deceitful, oppre ssive and abominable both by defin ition and 'in the sight of the Lord'. No initiation and no secrecy is demanded of those who seek the Lord Jesus Christ. He says: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me' [Revelation, Chapter 3, verse 20]. And this offer is open even to some abomin able people whose evil Works of Darkness are discussed in this book if they repent: 'Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool' [Isaiah, Chapter 1,18]. 'But the fearful [of taking the plunge away from evil - Ed.], and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burnetii with fire and brimstone'. [Revelation, Chapter 21, verse 8]. CONFUSION AMONG 'CHRISTIANS', AND THE JEWISH RESPONSE Since Satan is the author of all lies and confus ion, and Lucifer is revealed as the false god that Freemasons hasten to worship (via his guises as the Great Architect of the Universe who went to sleep after his creation, an d JAHBULON), it follows that nothing any Masonic authority has written in the past, and nothing that such people will write about Freemasonry in the future, can be relied upon. We have already seen that Manly P. Hall was apt to write rubbish; and ther e are passages in the works of Albert Pike which read as though the author was stoned on drugs, which may indeed have been the case. On occasion, he all but evokes Lucifer in his wr itings, as in the notoriously revealing passage from his 'Morals and Dogma' tome, which is the Bible of American Scottish Rite Freemasonry: 'Lucifer', he gushes, almost in his familiar sorcerer's invocation mode, 'the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!' 14 . With Lucifer in the driving seat, Masonic writers, deceived of course themselves, face the problem that they cannot be believed. So it is not surprising that the authorities differ concerning the provenance of the sorcery formulae and gobbledego ok that infests the sterile rituals of Freemasonry. As we have seen, Ma ny P. Hall states unequivocally that 'Egypf was 'the cradle of superior culture and most exalted philosophy' and he invokes 'undeniable evidence', which he fails to provide, 'that the Egyptian Mysteries were the progenitors of modern Freemasonry', before la menting that the historical basis for his statement is actually all but lacking. With the benefit of our study of Scripture, we know that Egypt, as indicated, is the Old Testament's primary metaphor for 'the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"272 C HAPTER 5. The House of Lucifer Darkness' (no insult intended to modern Egypt); and, as also indicated, we know that the historical information provided in Exodus is a 'living metaphor' for God's wish to lead us away from the darkness (of sorcery, idolatry, the burden of sin, li es, murder and false witness) into the light 'of His Holy C ountenance'. Egyptian culture was focused upon death, whereas the intended culture of the children of Israel was focused upon 'the living God', who makes his Holy Spirit av ailable to us if we seek him. Later in the recorded history of the children of Israel, the elite and most skilled among them were exiled for 70 years to Babylon, as prophesied by Jeremiah, in Chapter 25, verse 11 (606 BC): 'And these nations [Israel and Judah, the two kingdoms] shall serve the King of Babylon seventy years'. In Chapte r 29, verse 10 (599 BC) Jeremiah adds: 'For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished, I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you, in causing y ou to return to this place' [Jerusalem], which is of course precisely what happened when the prophets Ezra (536 BC) and later Nehemiah (446 BC) returned with large numbers of Babylonian Jews to the long-destroyed City of David. Those among their number of later generati ons who secured the permission and blessing of later Babylonian kings to return to rebuild Jerusalem, returned to the Word of God; but large numb ers remained dispersed 'in Iraq', where they absorbed the magical sorcery and 'Ancient My steries' secrets of their pagan captors and hosts. After the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, when the sacrificial system of Moses ceased and the messianic rolls were destroyed, la ter generations of Jewis h 'scholars' took the most elaborate steps to merge the Torah with Babylonian Kabbalistic sorcery, a process that occupied many centuries - generating the Judaism of today, which is foreign to True Christianity and so incompatible with it as to render meaningless the deceptive phrase, 'Judao-Christian civilisation'. That, for them, there are, say, 49 interpretations of any given Judaic scriptural phrase is itself absurd, and it reveals that for this culture, there is no truth: how can there be, if every phrase of their scriptures has 49 interpretations? The Judaic-Kabbalistic mentality, tr adition and culture is, from the True Christian perspective, sterile - and reflects total the fulfilment of Jesus Christ's prophecy in Matthew, Chapter 23, verses 37-39, that since the Jews would not recognise who He is, and recognise the truth that He offered them, while He was with them , their 'house' would be empty and sterile - the word house meaning their 'religion': 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killes t the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord' [meaning Jesus Christ Himself] 15 . Rather than recognising who He is, the Je ws have wasted tw o millennia fiddling around with the Babylonian Ka bbalah, which their rabbis imported from Babylon and have merged incongruously with the Torah. In the spirit of Caiaphas, they have sought to destabilise and disadvantage Christianity ever since Jesus was executed. And since Lucifer enthroned himself in Rome almost from the outset, as is reviewed in Chapter 6, Jews, like almost everyone else, have confused True Christianity (of which most are entirely ignorant) with the reprobate Catholic Church, which for much of its history has been both conspicuously corrupt and the perp etrator, even, of cr imes against humanity. Other Churches, especially the Church of Engl and which was, of course, born of royal adultery, are 'daughters' of the Church of Rome, and are co mparably reprobate."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 273 In one sense, therefore, one cannot really blame the Jews for their animus against 'Christians', who for the most part were never followers of Jesus Christ. During the multiple outbreaks of the Jesuit-inspired Inquisition at rocities, authorised and promoted by the deceptively tided Pope Innocent III (1198-1216), which resu lted in the murder of upwards of 50 million people over a period of 500 years, certain hapless victims were strapped to a long table known as 'the rack' and stretched by rope and windlass; heavy pinchers were used to tear out fingernails or were applied red-hot to sensitive parts of the body; rollers with razor-sharp knife blades and spikes were used, over which the 'heretics' were rolled backwards and forwards; women were installed in a deadly hollow iron instrument which was the size and figure of a woma n, within which knives were arranged in such a way and under such pressure that the helpless victim was lacerated within its deadly clasp; victims stripped of their clothing had their arms strapped behind their backs with a cord, weights were attached to their feet and a pulley then suspended them in mid-air or dropped and raised them with violent jerks, dislocating parts of the body; and some sensible people who rejected Catholic propaganda had molten l ead poured into their ears and eyes. Many Popes remain notorious for their odious deeds and their gross immorality. Pope Sergius III (904-911) obtained the Papal office by murder. J ohn XII (955-983) is described in \"The Catholic Encyclopaedia' as 'a coarse, immoral man, whose life was such that the Lateran was spoken of as a brothel'; Pope Boniface VII (984-985) maintained his position by distributing stolen funds; Benedict VII (1012-24) 'bought the office of the Pope with open bribery'; and on 31st October 1501, Alexander VI (Roderigio Borgia, 1492-1503), who consulted astrologers and sorcerers, conducted a sex orgy in the Vatican, featuring 50 nude girls for the pleasure of his guests 16 . During the Council of Constance, three Popes, and sometimes four of them, cursed each other every day, calling their opponents (probably accurately), antichrists, demons, sodomites, adulterers and whatever other descriptive insult came to mind. A John XXIII (1410-1415) not to be confused with the modern Pope who curiously adopted the same name and number, was accused by 37 witnesse s of fornication, incest, adultery, sodomy, simony, murder and theft. Innumerable witnesses proved that he had violated 300 nuns, who were kept for the purpose. This particular Pope was publicly referred to as the Devil Incarnate. He taxed everything in sight - including usury, gambling and prostitution. According to 'The Catholic Encyclopaedia' its elf, again, one of the very worst Popes was Boniface VIII (1294-13 03). It states that 'scarcely any possible crime was omitted - infidelity, heresy, simony, gross and unnatural immorality, idolatry, magic.... Protestant historians, generally, and even modern Catholic writers... class him among the wicked Popes, as an ambitious, haughty, and unrelentin g man, deceitful also and treacherous, his whole pontificate one record of evil' 17 . Many other Popes (not to mention one woman who masqueraded as a man but gave birth to a child during a procession from St Peter's to the Lateran, whereupon she died) - were guilty of abominations too numerous to list here. In later years, the Pope, who stands in the place of Christ, was blasphemously pronounced to be Christ Himself. On 20th June 1894, Pope Leo XIII pronounced that 'we hold on earth the place of God Almighty'; and on 9th January 1870, the Vatican C ouncil had proclaimed: 'The Pope is Christ in office , Christ in jurisdiction and power... we bow down before thy voice, O Pius, as before the voice of Christ, the God of truth; in clinging to thee, we cling to Christ'. Given such a dreadful back ground, it is indeed hardly surprising that the Jews have likewise clung over the centuries, in the face of such abominations, to the misapprehensions of their ear lier leaders under Caiaphas."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"274 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer THE JEWISH KABBALISTIC CONT RIBUTION AND DIMENSION Moreover, such, historically, have been the provocations of evil men calling themselves Christians over the centuries, that it is almo st reasonable to sympathise with decisions believed to have been constructively taken by Jewish leaders to undermine what they considered to be Christianity, which they cannot, or refuse to, distinguish from the Word of Jesus Christ - even though ev en a brief examination of Jesus' legacy leaves no doubt that the man-made, organised Christ ian churches are, for the most part, gross, blasphemous aberrations. The issue of Jewish influence within, or of cooperation and annexation via the Illuminati of, Freemasonry has been the subject of debate for a century and a half. On 3rd August 1855, Dr Isaac M. Wise, a Mason, publis hed an editorial in the US journal \"The Israelite', which contained the following 'illuminating' paragraph: 'Masonry is a Jewish institution whose history, Degrees, charges, passwords and explanations are Jewish from the beginning to the end, with the exception of only one by- Degree and a few words in the obligation'. This statement was cited by Samuel Oppenheim in an article 18 published by the American Jewish Histor ical Society in 1910, in which th is Jewish non-Mason elaborated: 'That the connection of Jews with Masonry in the early history of the United States was of benefit to them, as well as that it was to the advancement of The Order, is probably [sic] true, though little has been written on the subject by Jewish historians. An examination of the various publications accessible here [in New York], relating to Masonry, reveals the names of Jews who have often been mentioned in works treating of their race, and who have been representative men in their respective States. Their names appear in lists of members of the subordin ate and Grand Lodges of many of the original thirteen States. They were, however, always a small minority in the few Lodges with which they were connected. Among their fellow members or those with whom they were brought into relation through Masonry were men prominent in the affairs of the nation. Several Jews are known to have been memb ers of the Lodge with which Governor Oglethorpe, of Georgia, was connected. In the Lodge to which Washington belonged, a Jew... was a member. Jews, also, were members of the Lodge to which belonged Edmund Randolph and John Marshall, of Virg inia, and DeWitt Clinton, of New York, all of whom were Grand Masters in their respective States. In Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina, prominent non-Jewish names were likewise met with as members of Lodges to which Jews were admitted. The relationship of Jews to The Order brought them naturally more directly into c ontact with their Christian brethren than would otherwise probably have been the case...' 19 . Note the author's use of the phrase The Order to describe Freemasonry, when he is really referring to The Order of the Illuminati. The use of this phrase by Jesuits, Opus Dei, Ordo Templi Orientis and innumerable others perpetrating Works of Darkness is indicative of the fact that all these organisations are instruments of Lucifer and either collaborate with, or are integrated within, the Illuminati. Three words are purposely omitted from all usag e of this 'universal' phrase The Order', namely 'of the Quest': it stands in fact for 'The Order of the Quest'. The Brotherhood is 'The Brotherhood of the Quest' whic h is engaged in seeking 'ha ppiness for all mankind', without Jesus Christ. If the words 'of the Quest' were added, the various compartmentalised sects would betray that they are of the Rosucrucian Illuminati.

In other words, pagan deities are equated with Jesus Christ - which is to say, gods that represent devils, purport to be indistinguishable from Christ. Satan turns all truth upside down. This familiar lie is repeated ad nauseam today by those who, out of i gnorance or perversity, insist that the various organised 'religions' are all concerned with seeking the same God - so that it is as possible to blaspheme against false gods and prophets, as it is possible to blaspheme against The Lord. Yves Marsaudon (Scottish Rite) praised the so-called 'ecumenism' nurtured by Vatican II, thus: 'Catholics... must not for get that all roads lead to God. And they will have to [sic] accept that this courageous idea of free-thinking, which we can really call a revolution, pouring forth from our Masonic Lodges, has spread magnificently over the dome of St Peter's' 2 . This confirmation that the assault against Chri stianity (both as i nadequately represented by the organised 'Christian' churches and by True Christianity based on the Word) is indeed a Masonic assault (driven in parallel of course by the llluminati penetration within Freemasonry), is supported by numerous insi ders, whose opinionated arrogance has provided yet further ample proof of this dimension of the Luciferian conspiracy. For instance, in Le Catholicisme Liberal [1969, repeated by Lefebvre, (see Note 2), page 100], Marcel Prelot, a French Senator and of course a Freemason, proclaimed that 'we had struggled for a century and a half to bring our opinions [sic!] to prevail with the Church an d had not succeeded. Then came Vatican II, and we triumphed' 3 . In reality, they only 'succeeded' in p enetrating a false repres entation of the Truth. They did not succeed in the true sense: for it is a fact that evil spirit(s) will respond and consent to being cast out exclusively by Jesus Christ - a reality that will be confirmed by any genuine Christian exorcist, and which, in the Author's experience, provides the conclusive, unchallengeable proof of the unique divinity of Jesus Christ. The Author was made definitively aware of this by his friend, the late Dr Malachi Martin; but it is confirmed in Mark, Chapter 16, verse 17: 'And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my Name shall they cast out devils'. Moreover the devils know him. for instance, the man who met Jesus in the country of the Gadarenes 'who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains'; who. with the gargantuan strength of the possessed, repeatedly broke his chains and fetters, and who 'always, night and day... was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones', did something quite remarkable: 'When he saw Jesus AFAR OFF' - not close up but AFAR OFF - he 'ran and worshipped him, And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most High God: I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not' 4 . For, indeed: The devils also believe, and tremble' 5 . Obviously, if devils can be cast out ONLY by the Na me of Jesus Christ, as is the case, they cannot be cast out by the names of Confucius, Buddha , Mahommed, Matreya, or even by the name of Mary. Likewise, 'no man cometh to the Father, but by me' 6 . ■ Notes and references: 1. 'The Menace of Freemasonry to the Christian Faith', Rev. C.

The Jews described in this paper were men of parts and character, and distinguished in the early American annals of their people. Their connection with The Order [u nstated: 'of the Illuminati'/ 'of the Quest'] was no doubt of significant benefit to their coreligionists, as it was to themselves, and brought them into relations with many not of th eir race, prominent in the official and civil life of the country, who were also members of the fraternity. Nearly all were members of the Hebrew congregations in the cities where they resided'. 'Though it is not maintained that [it was] because they were Masons [that] they arranged during 1790 for the loyal addresses of their various congregations in Wash- ington yet the facts presented herein may very well be considered in support of a theory that their connection with The Order made them feel doubly desirous to join in the welcome to the head of the nation, who like themselves was a Mason. The singular fact stands out that in Newport, the Jewish master of the Masonic Lodge delivered, on behalf of his Lodge, the first Masonic Address to Wa shington as President, at the same time that he delivered his address on behalf of his congregation, and that many members of the Hebrew congregations in New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, in Charleston and Savannah which likewise addressed W ashington, were also Masons' 20 . From this singular evidence alone, it is crystal clear that active and overt Jewish penetration of operational (as opposed to dogma tic) Freemasonry in the United States had taken place prior to the country's occu lt Revolution, which was an operation of geomasonic forces based in Europe. For Jews versed in their rabbi nical Kabbalistic literature, participation in Masonic Lodges did not entail any 'culture s hock' or impose any learning curve, especially in the US context, since the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross -Kabbalistic occultists in the English Elizabethan tradition of Jewish alchemy and sorcery - claimed to have been directly responsible for fomenting the American Revolution itself. ROSE CROIX, THE 'ORDER OF THE QUEST' AND THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION Manly P. Hall's extremely rare occult work, referred to above, entitled 'An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Kabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy: Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings concealed within the Rituals, Alle gories and Mysteries of All Ages', contains the following passage whic h needs to be cited before this Author will reveal the Jewish Kabbalistic pedigree of the sect of the Rosicrucians, whose primary 'prophet' was Sir Francis Bacon, the Elizabethan and Jacobean sorcerer and mystic (and the probable author of the works of Shakespeare as is clearly revealed in Hall's cited work): The Fraternity of R.C. [Rosy Cross - the Rosicrucians - Ed.] is an august and sovereign body, arbitrarily manipulating the symbols of alchemy, Qabbalism, astrology and magic to the attainment of its own peculiar purposes, but entirely independent of th e cults whose terminology it employs'. The three major objects of the Fraternity are: 1. 'The abolition of all monarchical forms of government' [with the exception, for varying transitional periods, perhaps, of any 'collaborating monarchies', such as those of Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands - Ed.] 'and the substitution therefor of the ruler-ship of the philosophical elect. The present democracies are the direct outgrowth of Rosicrucian efforts to liberate the masses from the domina tion of despotism'. [This explains why the globalist elite and key Illuminati figures ma nipulate the 'left-wing' and 'right-wing' dialectical 'opposites' to procure the 'democratic' outcomes that they seek, and why they openly regard democracy as a temporary, interim, transitory, dispos-"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 277 able phase which is scheduled for abolition: henc e, for instance, the anti- democratic structures of the corrupt European Union Collective - Ed.]. In his Rosicrucian-Masonic treatise, Hall wrote that 'in the early part of the eighteenth century the Rosicrucians turned their attention to the new American Colonies, then forming the nucleus of a great nation in the New World. The American War of Independence repres ents their first great political experiment and resulted in the establishment of a national government founded upon the fundamental principles of divine and natural law [sic!]. 'As an imperishable reminder of their sub rosa activities, the Rosicrucians left the Great Seal of the United States' [see Figure 47, page 281]. The Rosicrucians were also the instigators of the French Revolution, but in this instance were not wholly successful, owing to the fact that th e fanaticism of the revolutionists could not be controlled and the Reign of Terror ensued' [a phenomenon that was replicated after 1917 in Russia, and to which Manly P. Hall, who was living and writing in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Revolution, carefully omitted to allude - Ed.]. 2. The reformation of science, philosophy and ethics: \"The Rosicrucians declared that the material arts and sciences were but shadows of the divine wisdom' [sic!] 'and that only by penetrating the innermost reces ses of Nature could man attain to reality and understanding. Though calling th emselves 'Christians' [sic!], the Rosicrucians were evidently Platonists and also profoundly vers ed in the deepest [occult] mysteries of early Hebrew and Hindu theology. There is undeniable evidence th at the Rosicrucians desired to re-establish the institutions of th e 'Ancient Mysteries' as the foremost method of instructing humanity in 'the secret and eternal doctrine. Indeed, being in all proba bility the perpetuators of the 'Ancient Mysterie s', the Rosicrucians were able to maintain themselves against the obliterating forces of dogmatic Christianity [i.e. the dogmat ic assertions of the Church of Rome, which th ey confused with 'the simplicity that is in Chrisf - Ed.] only by absolute secrecy, and by the subtlety of their subterfuges. They so carefully guarded and preserved the Supr eme Mystery - the identity and interrela tionship of the Three Selves - that no-one to whom they did not of their own accord reveal themselves has ever secured any satisfactory information regarding either the existence or the purpose of The Order. The fraternity of R.C., through its outer organi zation, is gradually creating an environment or body in which the Illustrious Brother C.R.C. [sic: Lucifer - Ed.] may ultimately incarnate and consummate for humanity the vast spiritual and material labors of the Fraternity'. [Here, Hall anticipates the supremacy and hegemony of the Chief Rosicrucian, identifiably the blasphemous Christ Rose Croix, who is Lucifer - an intention epitomised and accelerated by such abominations as the fo ul revelling in Satanic exhibitionism of the reprobate Finnish 'Lordi', who 'won' the Eurovision Song Contest, a platform controlled by Illuminati forces, on 20th May 2006. We have to proceed now beyond this indication that the Rosicrucians, who are attached to and were the first to infiltrate Freemasonry, consider themselves to be the absolute custodians of the occult secrets of the 'Ancient Mysteries': it has been included here to show that the United States is a creation of the British custodians of Jewish kabbalistic sorcery, who left knowledge of their intent on the Great Seal of the United States - Ed.]. 3. [And because they seek immortality on earth, and seek to prolong human life indefinite ly as they secretly know that, having rejected Christ despite their absurd protestations to the contrary, they are destined for permanent spir itual and physical death - Ed.]: 'The discovery of the Universal Medicine, or panacea, for all forms of disease'.

There is ample evidence that the Rosicrucians were successful in their quest for the Elexir of Life. In his 'Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum', [the Rosicrucian occultist] Sir Elias Ashmole stated that the Rosicrucians were not appreciated at that time in England, but were welcomed on the Continent. He also stated that Queen Elizabeth was twice cured of the smallpox by the Brethren of the Rosy Cross, and that the Earl of Norfolk was healed of leprosy by a Rosicrucian physician... It is hinted by John Heydon [see below] that the Brothers of the Fraternity possessed the secret of prol onging human existence indefinitely.. .' 21 . In another work, entitled The Secret Destiny of America 22 , Manly R Hall stated unequivocally that the United States was meant to be and to procure the fulfilment of the aspirations of The Brotherhood of The Order of The Quest, and he elaborated that alchemists, the Illuminati of Italy (ultimat ely led by Giuseppe Mazzini), the Knights of the Holy Grail in Northern Europe, 'Christian and Jewish Kabbalists' and 'the Rosicrucians in their hidden houses [who] used the Rose of Sharon as the symbol of brotherly love, a simple rearrangement of the letters r-o-s-e becoming e -r-o-s, the Greek God of [physical - Ed.] love, Eros. ...All these groups belong to what is called The Order of the Quest. All were searching for one and the same thing under a variety of rituals and symbols. That one thing was a perfected social order, Plato's commonwea lth, the government of the philosopher-king' 23 [and his self-selected cohorts - Ed.]. Then Hall reveals how the occult Rosicrucians, who, as we have seen, regarded themselves as custodians of the 'Ancient Myster ies' and were dominated in Elizabethan and Jacobean England by Sir Francis Bacon, we re responsible for the conversion of the Masonic (stone cathedral-building) guilds into the co-custodians of occult gobbldegook (speculative Masonry), in th e following revealing passage: 'About the middle of the 17th century [the Baconian sorcerer - Ed.] Sir Elias Ashmole, patron of the liberal arts and foun der of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, was initiated into the guild of the operative Freemas ons of London, the first non-craftsman to be permitted membership. From that time on, the entire pattern of the guilds was changed, and speculative Masonry came to dominate the older form of the craft [i.e., it became witchcraft - Ed.], and the intellect builder came into his own. One veil of the old symbolism was lifted, to reveal in full clarity that the guilds were dedicated to a program social and political. In this way, the old dream of the philosophic [occultic, Luciferian - Ed.] empire descended from the ancient world to modern time. Secret societies s till exist, and regardless of the intemperance of the times, they w ill continue to flouris h until The Quest is complete. For more than three thousand year s, secret societies [synarchy - Ed.] have labored to create the background of [esoteric, Kabbalistic -Ed.] kno wledge necessary to the establishment of an enlightened democracy among the nations of the world' 24 . What was the precise connection between the Rosicrucians and the Jewish Kabbalists? It was manifestly close, both in tellectually and, this Author suspects, phys- ically; for several of their number, including John Heydon (Haydar) and Sir Elias Ash(er)mole, show signs of Jewish extraction. To complete this part of the analysis, it is necessary, finally, to cite a further passage in which the Jewish Kabbalistic-Babylonian"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 279 connection is explicitly revealed; and this pa ssage, too, is taken from Manly P. Hall's 'An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Kabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy: Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of All Ages', which extremely rare document contains the following passage: 'Johann Valentin Andreae is generally repute d to be the author of the 'Confessio' [context omitted here - Ed.]. It is a much -mooted question, however, whether Andreae did not permit his name to be used as a pseudonym by Sir Francis Bacon. Apropos of this subject are two extremely significant referen ces occurring in the introduction to that remarkable potpourri, 'The Anatomy of Melancholy'. This volume first appeared in 1621 from the pen of Democritus Junior, who was afterwards defined as Robert Burton, who, in turn, was a suspected intimate of Sir Francis B acon. One reference archly suggests that at the time of publishing 'The Anatomy of Melancholy' in 1621, the founder of the Fraternity of R. C. [the Rosicrucians - Ed.] was still alive. This statement - concealed from general recognition by its textual involvement - has escaped the notice of most students of Rosicrucianism. In the same work, there also appears a short footnote of stupendous import. It contains merely the words: 'John. Valent. Andreas, Lord Veru-lam'. This single line alone definitely relates Johan Valentin Andreae to Sir Francis Bacon, who was Lord Verulam, and by its punctuation intimates that they are one and the same individual'. From this, it is clear that the remodeller of the (German-originating) Rosicrucians was Sir Francis Bacon himself. The text from Manly R Hall's rare work continues as follows, confirming that the Rosicrucians had adopted and integrated the sorcery of the Babylonian Kabbalah into their 'philosophy', and that John Heydon was one of the primary collectors and integrators of this tradition into the Rose Croix: 'Prominent among Rosicrucian apologists was John Heydon, who inscribes himself 'A Servant of God, and a Secretary of Nature\". In his curious work, 'The Rosie Cross Uncovered', he gives an enigmatic but valuable description of the Fraternity of the R.C. in the following language': '\"Now there are a kind of men, as they themselves report, namely Rosie Crucians, divine [words missing] officers of the Generalissimo of the World [i.e., the Prince of this World, a.k.a. Satan. a.k.a. Lucifer - Ed.], that ar e as the eyes and ears of the great King [Lucifer - Ed.], seeing and hearing all things: they say these Rosie Crucians are seraph-ically illuminated, as Moses was, according to this or der of the elements, ea rth refin'd to water, water to air, air to fire'. He further declares that these mysterious Brethren possessed polymorphous powers, appearing in any desired form at will. In the preface of the same work he enumerates the strange power s of the Rosicrucian adepts: \"I shall tell you what the Rosie Crucians are, and that Moses was their Father...; some say they were of the order of Elias, so me say the Disciples of Ezekiel; * * * For it should seem Rosie Crucians were not only initiated into the Mosaical theory, but have arrived also to the power of working miracl es, as Moses, Elias, Ezekiel, and the suc- ceeding Prophets did, as being transported wh ere they please, as Habakkuk was from Jewry to Babylon, or as Philip, after he had baptised the Eunuch to Azorus [Acts, 8,40], and one of these went from me to a friend in Devonshire, and came and brought me an answer to London the same day, which is four days' journey; they taught me excellent predictions of astrology and earthquakes; they slack the Plague in Cities; they silence the violent Winds and Tempests; they calm the rage of the Sea and Rivers; they walk in the Air; they frustrate the malicious aspects of Witches; they cure all Diseases'\"."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"280 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer 'The writings of John Heydon are considered a most important contribution to Rosicrucian literature. John Heydon was probab ly related to Sir Christopher Heydon, \"a Seraphically Illuminated Rosie Crucian\", whom the late F. Leigh Gardner, Hon. Secretary Soc. Ros. in Anglia, believes to have been the source of his Rosicrucian knowledge. John Heydon travelled extensively, visiting Arabia, Egypt, Persia, and various parts of Europe, as related in a biographical introduction to his work, 'T HE Wise-Mans Crown, Set with Angels, Planets, Metals, etc., or the Glory of the Rosie Cross' - a work declared by him to be a translation into English of the mysterious book M brought from Arabia by Christian Rosencreuz\"'. [M is the 13th letter of the alphabet - Ed.]. The Kabbalistic magick, which is the essence of Rosicrucianism, was thus scooped up along with Middle Eastern Sufism, of which the (very dark) Emirs of Kuwait are custodians to this day. In summary, the following im portant connections emerge: 1. The Patriarch of the Rosicrucians was Sir Francis Bacon. 2. Rosicrucian 'philosophy' incorporates the entire content of the Kabbalah's sorcery, alchemy, divination, astrology and other abom inations [per Manly P. Hall's rare work]. 3. 'Babylonian' Jews appear to have collect ed Kabbalistic secrets for incorporation into Rosicrucian 'philosophy' and to have promulgated the Babylonian dimension of the 'Ancient Mysteries' in Elizabethan and Jacobean England, collaborating with the Rosicrucians to maximise the potential of this connection. 4. Sir Elias Ashmole, a Jew and a leading Rosicrucian, was accepted into the 'guild of the operative' [i.e., practical - Ed.] 'Freemasons in London' in the middle of the 17th century, being the first non-craftsman to be so admitted; and from this position, he spearheaded the conversion of the powerful secret guilds (whic h had remained secret societies since their foundation in the first millennium, so as to preserve their building secrets and thus to be able to maintain desired pricing structures, like a sort of professional cartel -Ed.). By this means initially, Masonry was, from the outset of its new 'speculative' (occult) manifestation, permeated with the sorcery of the Babylonian-Jewish Kabbalah. 5. Jews occupied powerful and influential positions within Masonic Lodges in the United States long before the Masonic Revolu tion, which they welcomed enthusiastically, having been involved in its planning. 6. The Revolutionary United States was founded in a Masonic Lodge in Philadelphia, was later endowed with a capital city which is laid out (as is well known) to replicate various Masonic symbols, is driven by Rosicrucian-controlled Freemasonry, and was provided with a Great Seal which contains the R. C. secrets of its purpose. The Great Seal was imposed upon the new Republic by the Kabbalistic Rosicrucians 'as an imperishable reminder of their sub-rosa activities'. Later the Rosicrucians tried to pull the same trick in France, but initially failed, though a precedent was set for later upheavals. It would appear that the United Kingdom was prevailed upon, coerced or otherwise persuaded to abandon her global Empire as a quid pro quo for the United States' assistance during the Second World War. At some stage during the War, the United Kingdom was made to understand that the Rosicrucian mission of the Revolutionary United States remained to be fulfilled and that a unity of purpose would be essential in order for these plans for global hegemony to be realised. Implementation of the Rosicrucian project for a 'New World' - that is to say, to be New World-driven - Order, which was initiated by Sir Francis Bacon and his secret affiliates on the Continent, especially France, the Netherlands and Germany, was not to be impeded any longer. It was, however, delayed by the Cold War, and is used as cover by the Nazi International dimension of German Illuminism."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 281 THE ROSICRUCIAN GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES CLEARLY PROMULGATES THAT THE NATION'S GOD IS LUCIFER Figure 47: The reverse and obverse of the Great Seal of the United States.

His name, written in his own hand, is to be found in their record ledger, close to that of the Marquis de Lafayette. According to Manly P. Hall, writing in 'The Secret Destiny of America', 'Franklin spoke for the Order of the Quest, and most of the men who worked with him in the early days of the American Revolution we re also members. The plan was working out, the New Atlantis was coming into being, in accordance with the program laid down by Francis Bacon a hundred and fifty years ear lier. The rise of American democracy was necessary to a world program' 25 . Here, then, we have the confirmation that the United States is a Rosicrucian, and therefore Kabbalistic, creation, built upon the foundation of the Christian Colonies, the Christian tradition of which it usurped: hence the US legal prohibition of the teaching of religion (i.e., Christianity) in state schools'. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the Great Seal of the United States, being a devious Rosicrucian concoction, is jam-packed with esot eric, occultic symbolism, which is replicated throughout the US Federal Government, as is illu strated by the familiar US official symbols and logos shown in Figures 48 and 49 on pages 289 and 293. Americans only became aware of what was on the reverse side of the Great Seal when it appeared on the one-dollar bill, in the Series 1935A. The Statue of Liberty, which the whole wo rld thinks of as representing freedom - is not what it seems, either. According to the American Christian analyst, Berit Kjos, 'Torch races date back to the ancient Greeks. A sanctuary in Olympia dedicated to the goddess Hestia, sister of Zeus, housed glowing embers which, every four years, would be fanned into flame by the winning athletes. To preserve the purity and power of the fire, it had to be moved with speed. Soon co mpetitions developed to see which individual or group - a relay - could move the torch the fastest. The winner won the honor of lighting the fire in the name of the patron deity of the city' 26 . Freemasons provided the United States with its occult torch-bearing 'goddess': 'Towering above the shimmering but polluted wa ters she holds in her outreached arm and hand a torch of fire and light.

But London has acquired a similar reputation, with elements of British intelligence engaged, like their US counterparts, in drug-trafficking operations, and thus committing crimes against humanity - specifically, their own people.

Hall's explanations for esoteric sorcery symbolism on the Great seal of the United States must be taken seriously. The following explanations are taken from his book The Secret Destiny of America' [ISBN 0-89314-388-X], 1944, pages 126 et seq.: • Phoenix: In mythology, the P heonix lives for 500 years; only one bird lives at any one time; and at its death its body opens and a new-born Phoenix emerges. The Phoenix thus represents immortality and resurrection (reincarnat ion). It is used as an emblem of power, superiority, immortality. Represents the signature of The Order of the Quest. • The Great Pyramid of Gizeh: The pyramid is composed of 13 (occult number) rows of Masonry, showing 72 stones. The pyramid is without a capstone. 'No trace has ever been found of the cap of the Great Pyramid. A flat platform about thirty feet square gives no indication that this part of the structure was ever otherwise finished; and this is appropriate, as the Pyramid represents human society itself, imperfect, incomplete. The Great Pyramid was believed by ancient Egyptians to be the tomb of the god Hermes, or Thot, the personification of Universal Wisdom. • The 72 stones: This represent s the Kabbalistic mathematical 'power of 72' phenomenon on which the Babylonian fiat money system is based. The 72 stones are also the 72 arrangements of the Tetragrammaton, or fou r-lettered name of God in Hebrew. These four letters can be combined in 72 combinations, resulting in what is called the Shemhamforesh, 'which represents, in turn, the laws, powers, and energies of Nature by which the perfection of man is achieved' [sic]. • Obverse of the Great Seal: The obverse of the Great Seal of the United States has been used by the Department of State since 1782 , but the reverse was not cut at that time because it was regarded as a symbol of a secr et society and not the proper device for a sovereign state'. • The All-seeing Eye: Manly P. Hall writes: The pyramid is without a capstone, and above its upper platform floats a triangle containing the All-Seeing Eye surrounded by rays of light'. Dr Cathy Burns, the US author of 'Masonic and Oc cult Symbols Illustrated' [Sharing, Mount Carmel, PA, 1998] devoted a complete chapte r [Chapter 20] on the All-Seeing Eye, which appears on MI5's symbol [Figure 1, on page 3]. It is one of the most prominent symbols of the llluminati. In Masonry, the eye is used to represent Osiris. Albert Pike, the sorcerer and Grand Patriarch of modern US Freemasonry, stated that the All-Seeing Eye is 'the emblem of Osiris, the Creator' ['Morals and Dogma', op. tit, pages 15-16]. The All-seeing Eye is found in Egypt India and elsewhere in the world, as symbo lic of the supreme occult power. Pike further explained that 'the Blazing Star has been regarded an an emblem of Omniscience, or the All- Seeing Eye.... It has the Kabbalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe' ['Morals and Dogma', op. cit., page 16]. On 15th September 2005, 16 'cooperating' nations took part in a stage of a six-week military exercise called Exercise Bright Star, during which fixed-wing aircraft from the 13th US Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) force and three other c ountries carried out a fly-past (in US English, a fly-by) above the Great Pyramid. A total of 8,000 US troops were operating in Northern Egypt (the PRIZE: see page 231] for the duration of the exercise. Details of this exercise were posted on the US Marine Corps' website, which has a jet-black background. ALL websites with a black background are llluminati sites. Sergeant Justin R. Peterson, of Dearborn, Michigan, was quoted on the website as making the following Masonic observation: 'It was basically a multinational handshake'. The 16 nations taking part in the Exercise were from what the llluminati Rosicruc ian capos of the New Underworld Order project call the 'Functioning Core'. ■"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"284 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer ENGLISH AND GERMAN KABBALISM IN EARLY AMERICA Sir Francis Bacon's Kabbalistic secret Society of the Rosie Cross 'was set up in America before the middle of the 17th century', according to Manly P. Hall, so that by the time of the American Revolution, the True Christia n basis of the Colonies had been severely compromised by this Babylonian-occult infusi on. 'Bacon himself had given up all hope of bringing his dream to fruition in his own country, and he concentrated his attention on rooting it in the New World [HENCE the slogan-phrase: 'New World Order']. He made sure that the American colonists were thor oughly indoctrinated with the [Illuminati's seemingly innocuous] principles of religious tolerance, political democracy, and of social equality. Through carefully appointed representa tives, the machinery of democracy [which the Illuminists need to install in order to be able to manipulate the 'mechanistic' dialectical 'opposite' forces that they crea te - Ed.] was set up at least a hundred years before the period of the Revolutionary War' 28 . The Rosicrucians had meanwhile develope d relationships and virile centres of Kabbalistic esoteric operatio ns on the European Continent, having 'gone international' from their earliest years, as Hall elaborated: 'Bacon's secret society [the Rosicrucians - Ed .] was not limited to England; it was most powerful in Germany, in France, and in The Netherlands, and most of the leaders of European thought were involved in the vast pattern of his purpose. The mystic empire of the wise [sic, i.e. of sorcery] had no national bound aries and its citizenry was made up of men of good purpose [sic! Remember: the De vil turns everything upside down: this should read 'bad purpose', of course - Ed.] in every land. The Alchemists, Kabbalists, Mystics and Rosicrucians [i.e., soothsayers and sorcerers - Ed.] were the incisive instruments of Bacon's plan. Representatives of these groups migrated to the Colonies at an early date and set up their organization in suitable places' 29 . And the German dimension mani fested itself from a very early stage, revealing that the German branch of Kabbalistic sorcery and Illuminism was engaged in America from the late 17th century onwards. Given this background, it is no longer hard to understand how it has come to pass that German Illuminism has such a brutal stranglehold within the US official, corporate and financial sector structures. 'One example', Hall explains, 'will illustrate the trend. About 1690, the German Pietist theologian, Magistar Johannes Kelpius, sailed for America with a group of follow ers all of whom practiced mystical and esoteric rites. These Pietists settled in Pennsylvania and th eir descendants still flourish in Lancaster County. Kelpius for some years lived as an Anchorite in a cave located in what is now Fairmont Park, Philadelphia. The Pietists brought with them the writings of the German Jewish mystic, Jacob Boehme, books on magic, astrology, alchemy, and the Kabbalah'. The Rosicrucians first emerged in 14th century German y, long before Bacon hijacked their occult fantasies. In 1627, Bacon had published his 'New Atlantis', as a kind of appendix to a work called 'Sylva Sylvarum', a natural history of ten centuries. It showed the figure of an ancient creature representing Time drawing a female figure out of a dark cavern. The meaning of this illustration is that through time, the 'hidden truth' shall be revealed. Manly P. Hall explained in 'The Secret Destiny of America' that 'this figure is one of the most famous of the seals or symbols of The Order of the Quest 30 . The document contained a single reference to a secret society and revealed allegorically that Bacon, having despaired of any prospect of establishing an 'ideal' society in touch with 'hidden forces' (demons), had set his mind on 'enlarging the bounds of human empire' 31 in the Americas."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 285 THE SORCERY OF THE BABYLONIAN KABBALAH AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS The Kabbalistic Degrees of 'higher' Masonry ar e in touch with all secret societies, both Masonic and non-masonic. Possession of a Kabbalistic diploma by the member of a non- Masonic Satanic sect enables non-masons to vi sit Lodges and inner shrines of ordinary Masonry in all countries of th e world. This is because the heads of non-Masonic Satanic sects belong to exalted Degrees of the various Masonic rites; and if so requested by sub- ordinates, the heads of such Satanic organisations will provide diplomas or documents providing entry to any Lodge anywhere, on de mand, accompanied by 'sacred' words, and yearly and half-yearly passwords applicable to all the Masonic rites everywhere. All kabbalists indulge in necromancy, the forbi dden practice of evoking the spirits 'of the dead', a component of the 'Ancient Myster ies' which the Luciferians seek to have enthroned as the international norm for all mankind. However since Satan and his demons are the authors of lies and deception, spirits of the dead evoked in Satanic ceremonies or in o ccult seances are never thos e of the dead person in question, but are invariably evil spirits masquerading as such. These truths were even recognised by Carl Hackse, who made an extensive study of occultism under the pseudonym Dr Bataille in Le Diable au XIXe Ciecle 32 : 'According to the teaching of the Christ ian Churches, God allows demons certain limited powers, but they are not permitted to open the Gates of Hell and release a spirit at the request of one who evokes the dead. The dead, even damned, will not show themselves if evoked, nor would evocations be answered by those who had succeeded in attaining the Kingdom of Heaven, but the devils can and do, says the Church, substitute themselves for the deceased. They will impersonate a dead person whose appearance is demanded by invocations'. The Church is correct about this. The Kabbalah is Occult Science itself, the se cret Satanic theology of the initiates. So, when the 'ascending' Mason reaches the Ka bbalistic Degrees, he becomes involved in Satanic invocations - as the Kabbalah, the Baby lonian secret religion which has polluted Judaism and Freemasonry, teaches magic, or the art of intercourse with spirits and supernatural beings. The rare work by Manly P. Hall to which references have been made contains specific instructions on how to summon the Devil himself. Any such activity, which is typically facilitated by drug-taki ng, is extremely dangerous, opening the perpetrator to the possibility of demonic infe station, even possession. Once possessed, the victim can only escape by a stupendous excercise of will and through the acknowledgement of the supremacy, with his or her own lips, of Jesus Christ - the one and only Name to which Evil Spirit will re spond, and of which it is terrified. No human being can fully understand why it is that these spiritual phenomena exist. However this Author realised the truth of thes e matters as soon as he understood what has been stated above - namely, that it is a we ll-attested fact, acknowledged by all genuine, prayerful exorcists, that there is precisel y ONE, and ONLY ONE, means of casting out devils - and that is through the Name and co mmandment of Jesus Christ. Only those who are 'right with Christ can perform exorcisms in safety. Likewise, it is hazardous to confront direc tly those who are driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer'. Precautions have to be taken. For example one should never, ever, accept an invitation to a meal or drinks with any of these 'Dark Actors Playing Games', for fear of suffering the fate of poor, brave A ndy Stephenson, Mozart or David Kelly. The involvement of heads of government in sa nctioning assassinations today is more widespread than most people realise, reflec ting the scale of modern official criminalism."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"286 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer COMMON SORCERY AND DIVINATION TECHNIQUES There are two categories of Kabbalistic magic: divining magic, subdivided into several branches, and operative magic. Subdivisions of divining magic include: • Astrology: Divination of the future by the st ars (the Biblical 'host of heaven'), of which the casting of horoscopes is its most prevalent practice. • Palmistry: Divination of the future by 'reading the hand'. • Oneirocritics: Divination of the futu re via the interpretation of dreams. • Pyromancy: Divination by fire, as intentionally implied by the Psy-Ops Devil in Mark Phillips' Devil-in-the-Smoke, and the CNN image. • Cartomancy: Divination by playing car ds, which themselves carry occult images. 'The first deck of cards was made fo r Charles of France in 1392. King Charles was insane. It is not generally known by card play ers that cards have secret meanings. The King card represents the enemy of God, the De vil. The Ten Spot represents the spirit of lawlessness and is in direct opposition to the Ten Commandments of the Bible. Closely associated with the Ten Spot card is the Club card. When cards were invented, the club was the weapon of the murderer; so the Club card stands for murder.. The Jack represents the lustful libertine who lives off the gains of pros titutes. It represents the moral leper. The Queen card represents the Virgin Ma ry, the mother of Our Lord. In the secrets of cards, she is called the mother of harlots. The Joker in ca rd language represents our Lord Jesus Christ. Joker means fool. Jesus Christ is held up by card players as a fool. And if this is not bad enough yet, the secret language of cards goes further and declares that Jesus (the Joker card) is the offspring of a lustful Jack, and the Queen Mother, Mary' 33 . The best way to consider these diversionary practic es is to treat them with contempt as 'enticements' or 'come-ons' - a fascination for which will be liable, and is intended, to lead the prospective victim towards the 'real thing', which is operative magic, of which the following subdivisions are widely noted: Alchemy and Necromancy, both of which, for instance, are found embedded in the Rosicrucian secrets. When the Author mentioned his awareness of the fact that the rare book by Manly P. Hall contains specific instructions on how to raise 'the Devil', the Catholic expert to whom he was speaking commented: 'Yes, and it works, too'. The Author wondered how he could possibly know this. Other operative magic categories include Magnetic Mesmerism, Theurgy, and various miraculous feats (which are usually frivolous but, if healing is involved, do not yield permanent results). Albert Pike, the Patriarch of American Freemasonry, and the founder of the separate Palladian 'higher' occult Masonic rites, used to boast of demonic manifestations with which he had been associated. Addressing the Supreme Council of Charleston on 20th October 1884, he described what happened at a seance at St Louis: 'We operated the grand rites, and through Sister Ingersoll, who is a first class medium [i.e., capable of invoking evil spirits - Ed.], received astonishing revelations during a solemn Palladian session at which I presided, assisted by Brother Friedman and Sister Warhnburn. Without putting Sister Ingersoll to sleep, we saturated her with the spirit of Ariel himself, but Ariel took possession of her with 329 more spirits of fire and the seance from then on was marvellous [sic]. Sister Ingersoll, lifted into space, floated over the assembly and her garments were suddenly devoured by a flame which enfolded, without burning her. We saw her thus in a state of nudity for over ten minutes. Flitting above our heads, as though borne by an invisible cloud, or upheld by beneficent [sic!] spirits, she answered all questions put to her.... Then Astaroth, in person, revealed himself, fl ying beside our medium and holding her hand. He breathed"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 287 upon her and her clothes, returning from nowhere, clothed her again. Finally, Astaroth vanished, and our sister fell gently on to a chai r, where, with her head thrown back she gave up Ariel and the 329 spirits who had accompanied him. We counted 330 exhalations in all at the end of this most successful experiment' 34 . So nine demons remained. Like all who play around with sorcery, Pike was himself fooled by such displays, in which evil spirits, summoned by his sorcery, demonstrated that they could possess any of his associates at any time in response to being raised, and c ould also be self-expelled by the victim. That is almost unheard of, so the particular deception embedded in this description was the lie that, once possessed, th e victim can 'turn possession on and off' as he or she sees fit. That lie, in turn, created the illusion that there could be nothing especially hazardous about such activit ies - whereas the op posite is the case. True, some people do not realise that they may be partially possessed: the Author knows of one person who is totally oblivious of this fact, but he has heard 'that voice' emitted by the person concerned, in extrem e anger. 'That voice' is always the same, worldwide: it can best be described as resembling the voice of a man speaking from down a drain, and is described by Isaiah [Chapter 29, verse 4, as follows]: 'And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy sp eech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust' 35 . Albert Pike is known to have established the 'high-occult' Palladian Rite, which is allegedly open by invitation only to Masons w ho have reached 'high' levels (= low levels) in their respective Lodges. A note in Lady Queenborough's study states, though, as follows: 'In his 'Cyclopedia of Fraterniti es', Stevens writes that the \"Order of the Palladium\" was founded in 1730 and soon afterwards introduce d in Charleston where it remained inactive until 1886', when Albert Pike rediscovered and revived it. 'It blossomed anew under the name of \"reformed Palladium\" and gave a new impulse to the traditions of High Masonry. Stevens adds that the Palladium is little known as the number of its members is strictly limited and the deepest secrecy surrounds all its deliberations', which have to do with the worst excesses of sorcery and occultism 36 . ALCHEMY AND THE ELEXIR OF LIFE The Alchemy dimension of operative magic, practiced by Kabbalists and at all the Kabbalistic levels of Masonr y, is called Hermetic Science, and has two objectives: (a) Discovery of the philo sopher's stone, a substance capable of converting metals into gold, but also a metaphor for the creati on of wealth out of nothing; and: (b) Discovery of 'drinkable gold' or the Elexir of Long Life, a magic potion endowed with properties capable of prolonging human life indefinitely, or at least of facilitating in old age the facilities of youth. Althoug h some dismiss the importance of these crackpot notions in the Masonic (or any) context, it is a fact that these 'high' Luciferi ans crave, and often experience, long life. Because they know that thei r end will be hellish, and that they are on the fast track to perdition, these people have historically craved a reliable means of defying death and of greatly extending the span of human existence on earth. In 2004, George Bush Sr. celebrated his 80th birthday, and he appeared to be endowed precisely with the faculties of youth. The late Congressman and 'high' Illuminist, Strom Thormund, lived to over a hundred years old, before he finally kicked the bucket. All Skull and Bones alumni are symbolically 'reincarnated' when they rise from a coffin, and Masons are indoctrinated into th e acceptance of the bizarre and erroneous"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"288 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer notion of reappearing on earth as another creature or human being after death - a device of Satan to convince them that what they are building on earth will be theirs to enjoy in their next reincarnation, which is of course a pagan fantasy borrowed from eastern religions. The Frontispiece of Manly P. Hall's 'The Lost keys of Freemasonry' [see Figure 16, page 45] shows a Masonic candidate being raised from a co ffin by a priest wearing the mask of a lion in the 'Pyramid Mysteries'. The Lion is givi ng the candidate the Lion's Paw' grip [see Addendum 10, page 734]. This symbolic nonsense inculcates the idea of reincarnation, which is universally accepted by the 'Useful Idiots' who have allowed themselves to be enticed by this slow-motion introduction to sorcery and Lucifer; but the caption reads: 'By this grip the spirit in man, long buried in the sepulchre of substance, is raised to life, and the candidate goes forth as a builder entit led to the wages of an initiate'. It's all gobbldegook and worthy of the utmost contempt. As for the 'philosopher's stone', which calls for the creation of wealth out of nothing, the secret of how to do this has been perfecte d in recent years, with the (perfectly legal) practice developed among an extremely sele ct community of intelligence financial engineering experts, of generating colossal sums by the exploitation of collateral. This can be done by means of collateralisation and hypoth ecation, or, at a simpler level, by leveraging a substantial financial asset with Foreign Bank A, from which additional funds are borrowed, and then deploying a proportion of the additional funds as collateral with Foreign Bank B, with which the same process is repeated. Certain intelligence operatives have been doing this using stolen US Treasu ry assets, such as the Diamond Certificate worth $1.0 billion, shown in Figures 8 and 9 on pages 26-27. The fact that the Diamond Certificate carries serial numb ers that devolve to 666, indi cating that the issuance was related to the Vatican, reveals the Illuminati status of the 'Holy See'. Another dimension of alchemy has historically been the creation of toxins for poi- soning purposes - poisoning being the method of assassi nation most favoured by the Illuminati. The Alchemists knew about microbe s and toxins long before mo dern medical discoveries. Satanic bacteriological laboratories were working for millennia on cultures of bacilli or solutions with lethal toxic pr operties which, even when, like certain of the most demonic modern poisons, administered in infinitesimal doses, could distribute disease and death whenever judged necessary by the self-appointed 'Masters'. Reiterated historical reports and instances of the administration of poison to targeted individuals, mentioned in classical literature, including Mozart and right up to the 19th century, provide ample evidence of this. In 2 005, the Author was info rmed by a close colleague who has exposed some of the evils being perpetrated by certain dark cadres of the US intelligence community, that a US official with whom the subject of the use of poison was being discussed, had remarked menacingly, as though by way of a deliberate, t hough covert threat: 'Yes, a lot of that is going on'. In the United States, uttering threats is not in itself a criminal offence, contrary to the situation in the United Kingdom. The friend had in mind the poisoning of the activist Andy Stephenson, who exposed the rigging of the 2004 General Election in the United States th rough software manipulation. Figure 48 on page 289 opposite: Being a geomasonic Rosicrucian foundation, a consequence of a Masonic putsch, the United States Government advertises this fact in every possible symbolical way.

Eliphas Levi, a 19th century occultist and author of the hideous image of the goat in Figure 50A, page 297, knew how dangerous these activities are, and was prepared to admit as much: 'The experiences of theurgy and necromancy are always disastrous to those who indulge in them... First giddiness, then catalepsy followed by madness.... the atmosphere is disturbed, the woodwork cracks and doors tremble and groan in the presence of certain persons, after a series of intoxicating acts. Weird sounds, sometimes bloody signs, will appear spontaneously on paper or linen. They are always the same, and are classed by magicians as Diabolical Writings. The very si ght of them induces a state of convulsion or ecstasy in the mediums who believe themselves to be seeing spirits. Thus Satan, the Spirit of Evil, is transfigured for them into an Angel of Light but, before they will manifest, these so- called spirits require sympathetic excitement produced by sexual intercourse on the part of their devotees. Hands must be placed on hands, feet on feet, they must breathe in each other's faces, these acts often being followed by others of an obscene character. The initiates, revelling in these forms of excesses, believe themselves to be the elect of God and the arbiters of destiny. They are the successors of the fakirs of India. No warning will save them' 37 . No warning, it might seem, will save participants in the activities alluded to at Bohemian Grove [box, page 161], which replicate, perhaps on a more lavish scale than at any time in the history of human depravity, those described above. There is no difference whatsoever between the picture painted by the 19th century occultist, and what we know about how the elite behave at Bohemian Grove. Eliphas Levi continued: 'Theurgy is the highest Degree of occultis m. Necromancy is limited to the sum- moning of dead souls [sic!], but the Theu rgists' of the 19th century 'evoked entities described by them as genii, angels of light, ex alted spirits, spirits of fire, etc\". As Bataille wrote: 'In their meetings, scattered throughout the world, they worship Lucifer. The three mysterious letters J.. .B.. .M... that the co mmon initiates see in Masonic temples, are reproduced in the meeting rooms of the Lucife rians, but they no longer mean Jachin, Boaz, Mahabone, as in the Lodges, nor Jacques Bourginon Molay as with the Knights Kadosch; in reality, these letters mean: Jesus Bethlemitus Maledictus. Theurgy is therefore pure Satanism' 38 . Note that Levy, another Frenchman of Jewish extraction - a.k.a. Alphonse Louis Constant - who was frenetically engaged in propagating the Babylonian Kabbalah, professed to know perfectly well that blaspheming the Name of Jesus Christ was Satanic - by which that occultist author meant th at Illuminists believe, as Pike reveals, in Jesus Christ, even if they are Jews. Kabbalists admitted to the 'myste ries' of Theurgy, never mention the word Satan. 'They look upon certain dissident adepts who evoke the Devil unde r the name of Satan as heretics, whose system they call 'Goety of Black Magic'. They name their own practices Theurgy or 'White Magic', which is of course a contradiction in terms 39 . We are considering, in brief outline here, the extreme banality of the 'Works of Darkness', which are ALWAYS characteris ed by lies and deception. Hence the inversion of, for example, Black and White Magic, and the always proliferating confusion to be encountered when seeking to make sense of the innumerable Ma sonic and non-Masonic Degrees, manifestations, traditions, sects, and auxiliary bodies such as (in the United States) the"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 291 Shriners (for men), the youth categories of sub-masonry (De Molay, Job's Daughters and Rainbow Girls), and the auxiliary orders fo r women: The Order of the Eastern Star, Daughters of the Nile, and White Shrine [see Figure 51, page 299]. Nothing of value is gained from studying the aberrations and perverted teachings and activities of these myriad inventions of Lucifer-Satan, as they all reek of spiritual death and bo ndage, and all have one purpose: to entice the candidate, initiate or adept further and further down into the pit. In any case, we are enjoined specifically not to be enticed or interested by Works of Darkness and their perpetrators, so that the object of an investigation such as this must never be more than to inform, expose and reprove: we may know of these things, must we must NEVER know them - not least because they are always sterile: 'And have no fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, but rather reprove them' [Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, Chapter 5, verse 11] 40 . THE PERPETUALLY RELABELLED GNOSTICISM OF SIMON MAGUS Luciferian occultism is nothing new: it was the work of Satan from the foundation of the world, and thus also from the beginning of Christianity; and it was established by him precisely to undermine and pollute it. Its earliest generic title was Gnosticism, and its refounder was Simon Magus, descri bed by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 8, verses 9-10 and 18-24, as follows: 'But there was a certain man, called Simon, which before-time in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one; To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God' 41 , whereas in reality, as a sorcerer, the 'powers' he was demonstrating, for his own perverse glory, were those borrowed from devils. 'And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, Saying, give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost'. It is because of this precedent, that the nefa rious practice of offeri ng spiritual gifts in exchange for money or reward is called simony; and Peter rounded on Simon as soon as he understood what the 'former' sorcerer was asking: 'But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity' 42 . The last we hear in Ads of Simon is the next verse, where he asked Peter to pray for him 'that none of these things ye have spoken come upon me' - whereas Peter, in reproving him, had advised Simon himself to re pent and to pray for forgiveness, which Luke conspicuously failed to record Simon doing. Note that Peter had in fact cursed him, saying 'thy money perish with thee', meaning that both would perish. In bitterness he reverted to his sorcery and, as indicated, is identified as the founder of the Gnostics - one meaning of the G 43 to be seen on Masonic literature and in Lodges everywhere. The Gnostics operated at once as a specifica lly anti-Christian sect - as Simon Magus did not repent, resented being told off by Peter, and set about trying to deploy his 'magic' powers to destroy Christianity. Simon is believed to have founded an early 'Lodge' - a secret council consisting of hi s own initiates who received Satanic initiation. Gnosticism, like the 'Ancient Mysteries', was based upon spiritism, with the Gnostics' mediums giving instructions purporting to be derived from the gods (spirits)."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"292 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer Simon Magus, who was an adept of the Gnostic sect of the Dosithians, taught that his tame harlot, Helena, was the Holy Ghost (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) and instituted, one writer cited by Lady Quee nborough, says, 'certain foul and infamous Mysteries inexpressibly filthy, and had A ssemblies equally filthy to celebrate them, including ceremonies of public fornication. Simon Magus was succeeded, inter alia, by [sorcerers who were named] Basilides, Valentinius, Caprocrates, Marcus, Marcion, Cerdo, Epiphanes, and Montanus. Magus and hi s disciples purported to be Christians, but celebrated communion through copulation. No wonder Peter excoriated Simon Magus, whose repentance in Peter's presence was false (see also below). One authority even states that Simon Magus' Gnostics and their successors considered themselves 'superior to Peter or Paul or any of Chrisf s other disciples'. W ith the benefit of this knowledge, it is clear that Peter had confronted a pioneer adept of the House of Lucifer. The Apostles were given power by Jesus through the Holy Spirit to continue the Lord's great works, which incl uded healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and other wonderful works which always benefited the afflicted, and were never done for the glor- ification of the Apostles, who never boasted of these powers, as they were the priceless gifts of God. Gnosticism then, having the seal of Lucifer, was contemporary with the Apostle Peter, and has persiste d with no discontinuity into the modern era - changing its mask and labelling from time to time 44 , but always promoting the same objective: opposition to Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life, and the provision of a substitute false (Satanic) religion masquerading as the true source of wisdom and light. At different levels of Masonry, candidates and initiates are given different expla- nations for the prevalence of the letter G within the interlaced square and compass - the five- pointed (occult) star (the pentalpha of Pythagoras) which frames it. This emblem appears on entrances to Masonic Temples, on seals, on Masonic literature, on the rituals, everywhere. In the lower grades, Masons are ta ught that the G stands for Geometry. Where women are admitted as members, the mystic letter G is said to mean Generation. But to those found 'worthy' to penetrate in to the sanctuary of Knights Kadosch, the enigmatic letter becomes the initial of the doctrine of 'perfect initiates', namely Gnosticism. Kadosch is Hebrew for 'consecrated'. Hence, 'higher' Freemasons dedicate themselves to the glorification of Gnosticism, or deliberate, provo cative, relentless and insistent anti-Christianity (the spirit of Simon Magus), which Albert Pike defines as 'the soul and marrow of Freemasonry' 45 . There is no difference between the Gnosticism of the earliest years of Christianity and contemporary occultism - except that, as it was absorbed via German Rosicrucianism and through Bacon' s occultic elaborations into Freemasonry, the ancient magic of Simon Magus has been successively relabelled and wrapped in many layers of gobbldegook clothing. As Lady Queenborough explained: 'The fundamental principle of Gnosticism w as the double divinity (dual principle) and this is exactly the theological theory of mode rn occultism. The Gnostics claimed that the good God was Lucifer and that Christ was the Devi l, that what Christians call vice was for them virtue, and to the Christian do gma they opposed Gnosticism, a word Figure 49 on page 293 opposite: Further geomasonic and occult-esoteric symbolism displayed on US Federal Government emblems: (L) US Department of the Army; (M) Peace Corps (occult ying-yang image); (N) The US Department of the Army; (P) The Seal of the Speaker of the US House of Re presentatives; (Q) The US Department of Education (which, like its British equivalent, abuses its power to indoctrin ate and mind-control the young); (R) The General Services Administration, complete with the 13 stars, the Great Pyramid, and an occult Phoenix/Eagle; (S) The Naval Supply Systems Command; and (T) The US Naval War College.

Human, not divine, knowledge: in other words, the source of this knowledge was (the Devil working th rough) Man, not God. Modern humanism encapsulates this perverse spirit, which drives all organisations serving the interests of the implementers of the New Underworld Order. Look in vain for any spirituality in the endless cascade of dry, soulless documents spewed out by the European Comm ission. Seek it in vain in the output of all compromised institutions, including most churches 47 . A critical impulse to the Works of Darkn ess proliferated by Simon Magus and his successors (not elaborated upon here) was the fact that dawning Chris tianity, at the time of the Apostles, was a time of many miracles, since the Holy Spirit had been given to the Apostles so that they were able to continue the great works of Jesus Christ. 'The miracles performed by Jesus Christ bore a distinctive f eature, often overlooked, namely that in every case altruism was the sour ce of their inspiration', wrote Lady Queenborough 48 . And when taunted on the cross to save himself, our Lord chose not to use the powers that he divinely possessed, for His personal advantage - choosing death instead. Had he yielded to that last temptation, he would have fallen to the level of a Simon Magus. The glorious miracles essentially ceased, it is believed, with the deaths or martyrdoms of the Apostles. Peter, who loved the Lord so much, is believed to have refused to be crucified like Jesus, but requested that he sh ould be hung upside down, because he said he was not worthy to be crucified like his Lord. However there is actually no known historical corroboration of this report, whic h in any case has Peter martyred in Rome, which, as the Bishop of Jerusalem, he never visited. To fight the 'competition' from the grea t and wonderful works of the disciples of Jesus, the Gnostics under Simon Magus work ed overtime to mobilise occult powers, using sorcery and having recourse to diab olical marvels, which always produce tem- porary results and are capricious and hazardous. Gnostic 'mirac les' like 'weeping statues', revered by misled Catholics, or like th e Hindu religious rite of Samadhi which i nvolves being buried alive for a time, have no charitable purpose whatsoever: they are spiritually dead and of zero value. Their main purpose is to create wonderment, curiosity, or fables promoting faith in magic: indeed Catholic s addicted to 'weeping statues' call such supposed phenomena 'miracles', notwithstanding that no human being is involved. Failing any altruistic motive, such phenomena are classifiab le under the term Black Magic. Catholics who revere such phenomena deceive th emselves that they assist their worship, just as they argue that statues (graven images) of saints, the 'Virgin' Mary, etc, are not worshipped, but are merely 'aids to worship'. Th is convenient lie or excuse is a delusion, and an explicit contravention of God's injunc tion in Exodus, Chapter 20, verse 4: 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above' [i.e., the Virgin Mary - Ed.], or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth' 49 . All Christians are required to avoid giving heed to fables: 'Neither give heed to fables...' 50 . 'And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables' 51 . On 17th October 2005, 'Spiegel OnLine', the In ternet version of 'Der Spiegel', carried a lead story entitled P OPE B ENEDICT XVI C HANNELS J OHN P AUL II, in which it reported that in the course of the first extensive TV interview of his Papacy, the former Cardinal Ratzinger revealed that he 'sees and talks to his predecesso r'. In the interview, broadcast by a Polish station a day earlier, the German Pope said that, given the late Pope's abiding presence, 'I hear him and I see him speaking, so I can k eep up a continuous dialogue with him'. The Pope is occultically deluded: he is communing with a deceiving spirit."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 295 PAGAN SEX MAGIC CENTRAL TO GNOSTIC FREEMASONRY Secret Gnostic meetings at which sorcery and magic was practiced, 'needing' sexual activity which was and is integral to evok ing demons, were alwa ys associated with Bohemian Grove-style depravity - as the adep ts indulged in every kind of obscenity, often under the influence of drugs such as Indian hemp (cannabis indica) or opium, the medicinal properties of which, when adrninistered under certain ritual conditions, are 'provocative of mediumistic phenomena'. Thus the grotesquely evil drug-dealing activities of certain elements of British, American, German, French, Spanish, Soviet, Israeli, Chinese and some other intelligence services, in addition to representing crimes against humanity, serve the further Illuminist purpose of maximising the potential for occult practices under the influence of drugs. 'Thus debauched, their moral sense weakened, initiates are ready to work. They work, they fall, and as they fall, the occult pow er grasps its prey. Their life, henceforth, is subject to the will of the Hidden Masters who, according to their secret designs, will lead their slaves to power, or a semblance of power, or else to their downfall' 52 . The sexual nature of even the first three (Blue) Degrees belies claims by 'worker-bee' 'ordinary' members of these lower Degrees that the exoteric gobbledegook which they are required to absorb is innocent of any tinge of pagan-phallic orientation. According to a book on French Masonry, cited by Lady Queenborough 53 , the ritual of Master Mason (Third Degree) is explicitly sexual. It would be tedious to reproduce more than a few sentences of the description of the ritual, which remains symbolic at this Degree level: 'The Master holds the mallet, the two Wa rdens each hold a roll of cardboard nine inches in circumference by 18 inches long. These rolls represent the membrum virile'. 'In the middle of the Lodge is a mattress, coff in or ditch, which symbolises the bed... upon which are performed the mysteries of generation'. The fact that these mysteries and his ability to generate, cannot be created by Man, that is to say that he did not make himself, is conveniently and obtusely overlooked by these deluded diversionary occultists. This is a point repeatedly stressed in Scripture, for instance, in the hundredth Psalm, verse 2: 'Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture'. The phallus is used by the Freemasons in th e Degree of Master where it is designated by the word Mahabone (man is 'completed' by the Third Degree of Master'). This fecundation is supposed to take place as follows: In the early pe riod of initiation, the seed of the unfertilised grain is dead. The Candidate, wearing within him this inert seed, is a male as he only wears upon his breast the Compass emblem of the membrum virile. He is stretched upon a mattress, or in a coffin or ditch... Neither the second, nor the first warden can endow him with life. Alone, the Worshipful Master, wearing upon his chest the Square, symbol of the genitalia mulieris, representing the female (the Lodge), can fertilize this seed by leaning over the Candidate, who, representing the male, unites with him by the Five Points of Perfection (originally from Pythagoras' pentalpha five-pointed star). Th e seed is fertilised by the Union of the male and the female, and the Lodge becomes pregnant of the Candidate, which she brings into the world nine months later, as Perfect Master, Fourth Degree, it being established that nine full months must have passed since the aspirant had received the Degree of Master Mason'. What is being mimicked here is the human pregnancy period of nine months, which is a period ordained by God, not Man: and there is nothing whatsoever that these nutc ases can ever do about it. The obviously homosexual (and utterly repugna nt) connotations of the ritual need"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"296 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer no elaboration (thank goodness). Figure 50B on page 297, using a 19th century diagram, shows the 'five points of perfection' as applied in high-level Masonic greetings with the two participants standing up; how the 'Five Points of Fellowship' are achieved in the positions described in the ritual cited, disturbs the imagination. It is unfortunately necessary to complete this exercise, though, in order that the reader may understand that Masonic Degrees are sexually oriented from the outset - contrary to the 'sanitised' as opposed to 'Satanised') impression given to the 'profane' (the Masonic wo rd for the 'White') world, leading therefore inevitably at 'higher' (= lo wer) levels to debauchery and to widespread acceptance of it among the Maso nic-political el ite such as those who 'network' at the Bohemian Grove, when they are in an inebriated state or engaged in sexual excess. Therefore, the book on French Maso nry states that 'the basis on which are founded the first three Degrees of practical ('exoteric') Masonry are as follows: First Degree, Entered Apprentice: 'Tha t the Apprentice, Bohaz (Boaz), the personification of Osiris or of Bacchus, comi ng to search for Truth [a lie - Ed.] in the Lodge, finds that he is a Male-God [i.e., he has for this purpose become a god already! - Ed.] and incomplete for the generation of beings'. Second Degree, Fellow Craft: 'That the companion, Jackin (Jachin), person- ification of Isis or Venus, the Female-God, completes the Male-God by rendering possible the generation of beings'. In shor t, the false god cannot function alone. Third Degree, Master Mason: \"That the Master Mahabone or MacBenac is the Hermaphrodite... son of the sun and the earth\", made full man in this ritual 54 . LIES AND MAKEBELIEVE AS THE FOCUS OF BLUE DEGREE FREEMASONRY As we have seen, Albert Pike, the High Priest of contemporary Freemasonry, admitted that The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he underst ands them'. So the lies begin at once. In the First Degree, the naive candidate is informed that: • 'All originates by Generation, and not by Creation, which is only the simple induction of Generation'. This is the central lie of Freemasonry: that Creation arises because of Generation alone - an idiotic reversal, a childish and ignorant piece of nonsense which of course overlooks the facts that generation could never have started without a Creator, and that creative forces are needed to enable the act of generation to 'work'. The candidate is further lied to with this nonsense: • Corruption or destruction follows Generation in all its works. (But Our Lord Jesus Christ teaches, and the Holy Spirit inde libly affirms to those who have allowed themselves, by one single act of will, to be called, that if we 'die' to sin and are 'born again' through repentance for our sins, we ha ve fellowship with Him, a new life, and the hope of life eternal through His Glory and Grace. This is affirmed in Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 5, verse 17: Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new') 55 . • Regeneration restores, under other forms, the effects of destruction. This is the basis of the false Masonic doctrine, which takes ho ld of the initiate in 'higher' Degrees, of reincarnation, a totally reprobate invention which lacks credibility or foundation. For these reprobates, 'regeneration' is a Godless, mechanistic phenomenon.

The primary Masonic handshakes are named after the first three (Blue) Degrees: • Jakin (Jachin): The Column or the female organ, uterus. • Bohaz (Boaz): The Column, or the male ge nerative organ, or the phallus: the sacred word of the First Degree, Entered Apprentice. • Moabone, Mahabone (Ma-Ha-Bone): This demonic word means completed god; the Hermaphrodite: man is completed by the Degree of Master Mason, Third Degree. Masonry has thus stolen the names of the two special pillars of the Temple for its depraved purposes, confusing Masons in the Lodg e accordingly: see the Second Book of Chronicles, Chapter 3, verse 17, describing Solomon's Temple: 'And he r eared up the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz'. GERMAN JEWISH ORIGINS OF TH E AMERICAN SCOTTISH RITE The 'Ancient and Accepted Sc ottish Rite' originates from the rite called Scottish of Perfection or of Heredom, having 25 Degrees, which was 'worked' in Europe in the 18th century by Masons devoting themselves to occu ltism. Albert Pike says that 'in 1761, the Lodges and Councils of the superior De grees being extended throughout Europe, Frederic II (Frederick the Great), King of Prussia, as Grand Commander of the Order of Princes of the Royal Secret, or 32 Degr ees, was by general consent acknowledged Figure 50A: This notorious drawing of Baphomet, by the French-Jewish Mason Eliphas Levi (Alphonse Louis Constant), stresses the Masonic-Satanic emphasis on sex, the creature being androgynous, with the winged staff representing the phallus.

'On the 25th October 1762, the Grand Masonic Constitutions were finally ratified in Berlin and proclaimed for the government of all Masonic bodies working in the Scottish Rite over the two hemispheres; and in the same year they were submitted to the Jew, Stephen Morin, who had been appointed... in August 1761, Inspector General for the New World by the Grand Consistory of Princes of the Royal Secret, convened at Paris, under the Presidency of Chaillon de Joinville, representative of Frederick (the Great) and Substitute General of the Order.... The 33r d Degree was not then created; and under Frederic the Great, there was no rank higher than the 32nd Degree...' 57 . This statement definitively affirms the supremacy of Berlin as the central authority governing Scottish Rite Freemasonry in both Eur ope and America, and its seniority over the Political Action Centre established by Giuseppe Mazzini, of Jewish extraction, in Rome (The Vatican). Morin travelled to Santo Domingo, where he was joined by two fellow Jews, Moses M. Hays and Henry Andrew Francken, who founded a branch of the rite in Jamaica, while Hays was entrusted with founding Lodges in North America. Hays duly established a 'Sublime Lodge of Perfection' in Boston, of which he constituted himself Grand Master, and charged a fellow Jew and Mason, one Isaac Daco sta, who had founded the St Andrew Lodge in Boston, with the mission of introducing Masonry into South Carolina. On 27 th A ugust 1766, Brother Morin's patent was revoked by the Gr and Body in Paris for 'propagating strange and monstrous doctrines', and handed to a Brother Martin. [But] Morin continued constituting chapters with Dacosta, a full 17 years after his Freemasoni c patent had been annulled. In 1783, he inaugurated 'The Grand Lodge of Perfection' in Charleston, with Dacosta as its Grand Master - this unoffici al, unauthorised behaviour th us accounting for the strange, subsequent 'parallelism' of the ideological ce ntre consolidated in 1870 by Albert Pike in Charleston, after the American Civil War, with its countervailing revolutionary Vatican- based Political Action Centre. Morin was succeeded by another Jew, Joseph M. Meyers. It suited the Jews concerned to continue with the Jerusalem connection, and when the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem was established at Charleston on 20th February 1788, Meyers was one of the Deputy-Inspectors who established it. The two Masonic powers at Boston and Charleston created numerous Lodges and inner shrines in the United States, and each gave themselves the titles of Mother Lodges of the United States 58 . A Lodge at Albany, New York, was transmitting re ports to Berlin, the seat of the Prussian Monarchy, as early as 1770. It is clear th at the Prussians were using the New World's burgeoning Masonic network for espionage operations, and were employing Jews for that purpose. Pope Clement XII had excommunicated Freemasons as early as 1738. But the Jewish Masons, who obviously did not belong to the Catholic Church, continued promoting the cult in the United States in pursuit of their secret Kabbalistic agenda. On 15th May 1781, at a convention of Deputy-Inspectors called by Hays and Meyers at Philadelphia, Moses Cohen was named Deputy Inspector of Jamaica, as Francken, originally appointed by Stephen Morin to found Lodges there, had neglected his mandate. It was not long before another Jewish Freemason, Hyman Isaac Long the son of a Dutch writer called Isaac Long arrived in Jamaica, having derived his 'powers' from Morin. In addition to Francken, Hays and Moses Cohen, there was another prominent Jewish Mason associated with them at the time, called Spitzer.

The common feature of all these diversionary 'Orders' is that they deny the unique divinity of God and promulgate syncreticism. Some, like participants in 'Cedarism', and the Shriners, wear occultic headgear. All consume private financial resources and time, and divert their victims from the Truth. ■ AUXILIARY U.S. MASONIC BODIES 'ORDERS' SUPPORTING MASONIC DECEPTION OPS. FOR MEN • THE SHRINERS, or the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, are an 'Order' 'appendant' to Freemasonry. Up to 2000, it was necessary to COMPLETE the Scottish or York Rites so as to be eligible for Shrine membership. Today, any Master Mason can join. Although known for lavish and boisterous conventions, their strange 'fez' hat and charitable works (hospitals etc), members take a hideous blood oath during a bizarre Masonic-occultic initiation rite. The sole requirement is that the Shrine petitioner must vaguely believe in a 'Supreme Being'. This is another syncretist trap for the unwary. • TALL CEDARS OF LEBANON (Cedarism): 'Brethren' appear in occultic conical hats and use a cross+hexagram (sorcery symbol). •THE ELKS, which began life in North America as the 'Jolly Corks'. Members are 'Brothers' and the network uses the Masonic Lodge sys- tem, with a Grand Lodge. The Elks' Lodges maintained guest quar- ters which were forerunners of modern hotel chains like Holiday Inn. This is a fraternity only, with significant Jewish membership. FOR WOMEN • ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR: A Masonic organisation for women AND MEN which self-proclaims itself to be 'not part of the Masonic institution'. However a published address by a certain Worthy Matron insists:'... yet we are connected with Masonry by intimate and tender ties'. One ritual document reads: 'Ladies, you are connected with Masonry by ties far more intimate and tender than you are aware of, or that I can ever inform you of' - which leaves little scope for doubt as to what was meant. A man must be a Master Mason (+) in good standing, and a woman can only join if she has a dose relative who is a Master Mason. Both sexes must take blood oaths. This 'Order' justifies its exis- tence as a mechanism for enabling certain Masonic secrets to be replicated and perpetuated between the sexes. Detailed inves- tigations reveal that the Eastern Star 'Order' is riddled with familiar Kabbalistic pagan sorcery, rituals, symbols and trickery. • DAUGHTERS OF THE NILE [Egypt = The Darkness]. • WHITE SHRINE • PINK SERPENTS [Ultra-secret informers], FOR TEENAGERS • THE ORDER OF DE MOLAY: Like many sub-groups, open information on this 'Order' disclaims Masonic connections, specifically any links with the Knights Templar. However this is the best-known US 'fishing net' designed to capture naive youth for Freemasonry, and thus to divert their lives towards Lucifer at the earliest feasible age. In the open community, such pressures on young people have been joined by the llluminati-controlled pagan, sex-oriented pop culture. • INTERNATIONAL ORDER OF THE RAINBOW FOR GIRLS: Established by the 'Rev'. Sexson in 1922 as a youth organisation for girls from a Masonic or Eastern Star home. The blurb says that while 'The Order' uses some of Christian Scripture, the only membership requirement is 'belief in a Supreme Being', with Christian lessons used just to show 'basic values integral to many religions'. Subtle, subversive syncretism. • JOB'S DAUGHTERS: A Sub-Masonic Order for girls between 10 and 20, organised into 'Bethels' - like Masonic Lodges.

Thus the claims of Samuel Oppenheim concerning the importance of Jews within early US Masonry, cited on pages 274-276, are indisputable. Isaac Long found his scope for action (subver sion) too restricted in Jamaica, so he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, on the 33rd parallel. While the Mother Lodge at Boston failed to prosper, Long created other Lodges and brought in other rites (such as Royal Arch) under obedience to the Mother Lodge at Charleston. In 1775, Isaac Long travelled back to Europe, and did not return to the United States for six years. When he reappeared, he was clutching a plan to crea te a 33rd Degree rite, which he had developed while in Europe. He presided over the constitution of this rite, aided by the following further Jewish Masons: Dr Frederick Dalcho, Abraham Alexander, Isaac Auld and Emanuel de la Motta, all of whom were Sove reign Princes of Jerusalem, a title they had received from the Grand Master in Europe when receiving instructions to found Lodges abroad. According to Domenico Margiotta (also of Jewish extraction), 'he [Long] constituted this rite, taking twenty- five Degrees of the system of Heredom, six Templar grades in which were merged four Degrees (the 9th, 10th, 11th and 21st Degrees) borrowed from the German Illuminism of Adam Weishaupt, and two grades called Grades of Administration, the last of which supplanted the function of Deputy Inspector (Sove reign Prince of Jerusalem); and took the title of Sovereign Grand Inspector General, 33rd and last Degree. This was his crowning achievement [sic]. Isaac Long gave the institution the name of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites, and the first great constitutions were signed at Charleston on May 31st 1801'. Isaac Long was succeeded by Albert Pike as Sovereign Commander Grand Master: so Pike inherited all the consolidated work ings and rites of his Jewish colleagues and predecessors 59 . In Chapter 17 of her book 'Occult Theocrasy', Lady Queenborough states unequivocally that the 'Ancient and Accepted Sc ottish Rite (America)' and the 'Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (England)', founded 1761 is 'of Jewish origin and has 33 Degrees'. It is of course at Charleston, as noted on the 33rd parallel, that the epicentre of US 'unpatented' Masonry is located, although other key US centres include the overbearingly gigantesque George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria, and the dark Masonic library located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. THE GREAT ARCHITECT, SORCERY, WICKED MEN AND DEVILS IN THE LODGE Albert Pike, the successor of Isaac Long, was to conspire with Gi useppe Mazzini, the Italian Masonic revolutionary and modern organiser of the Mafia and of organised criminal drug-trafficking to procure the consolidation of what was intended to be a geo- masonic power centre, in parallel with Berlin. As Domenico Margiotta elaborated: 'The Mother Lodge of Boston had ceased functioning for some years but that of Charleston, reconstituted according to the ne w Scottish System in 33 Degrees, became the root of the tree which was to spread its branches over the entire world'. However, as Isaiah accurately prophesied [Isaiah, Chapter 5, verse 24], 'their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of th e Holy One of Israel' 60 . To complete the statement by the Italian high Mason, Margiotta: 'The Superior Lodge of the Grand Sovereign Inspectors General, in each country, was to be called the Supreme Council, and it is from the Supreme Council of Charleston that all the others were to emanate. It is thus the first Supreme Council of the Globe'. This conveniently 'forgets' that Mori n's Berlin mandate had been revoked in 1766."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 301 'Such is the origin of this rite which attr acted Mazzini's attention for, during the years which preceded the taking of Rome by the ar my of Piedmont, he could see that the provisions of Isaac Long [in the United States] had been realised. So it was Pike, the successor of Long, himself the Sovereign Commander Grand Master, that the great rev- olutionary conspirator [Mazzini] sought as an ally in his work the object of which was the total destruction of the church'. That we are indeed speaking of the House of Lucifer in the Synagogue of Satan, referred to in Jesus Christ's condemnation in the Book of Revelation, was reconfirmed by another Masonic writer, Blanchard, author of 'K night Templarism Illustrated', cited by Lady Queenborough 61 : 'Let the authoritative teaching of Dr. Mackey [the Masonic writer Dr Albert Mackey] be continually borne in mind, that 'The mission and object of Masonry is the worship of the Great Ar chitect of the Universe'. 'It follows that the Lodges must have something for their dupes to do, called worship [note this crucial open acknowledgement, like that of Albert Pike, that Masonry permanently and routinely deceives its own adepts, so that they are all what Lenin called 'Useful Idiots' - Ed.]. And what could wicked men and devils invent craftier or better suited to deceive the simple, than this very scheme of 'the Ancient Scottish Rite', which now rules the rites of the world' - and which Isaac Long and his Jewish Masonic co-conspirators, followed by Pike himself, scrabbled and concocted together, drawing from multiple sources - especially the Illuminati, the Templars and Jewish Kabbalism. Note that Blanchard openly acknowledges that his Masonic 'Brothers' are dupes and 'wicked men and devils', replicating similar such open admissions by other key Masonic writers, including Albert Pike: indeed, to acknowledge that Masons are the scum of the earth seems to be a standard requirement for su ch authors. One of the most extraordinary features of these people, when they are in their 'right' minds, is that they know perfectly well what is right and wrong; so they fulfil Paul's proclamation that 'knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things ar e worthy of death, [they] not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them' [Romans, Chapter 1, verse 32]. For Paul to have understood this could only of course ha ve been possible through the Holy Spirit, since our rational minds tell us that for someone to recognise what is wrong, to say so publicly, and at the same time to promote what is wrong with the 'seething energies of Lucifer,' is completely irrational: which, of course, even in their 'righf minds, these people, who deceive and lie as a matter of routine, always are, which is just one of many reasons why they are so dangerous 62 . This entirely ersatz, concocted, falsely preten tious and poisonous 'Ancient Scottish Rite', Blanchard calmly concluded, seemingly unperturbe d, 'seizes and appropriates all of religion, but its holiness and justice; and all of Christ, but his truth and his atonement. It mixes things sacred with things profane, till the whole compound is profanity; and quoting the Bible as if it believed it true, which notoriously it does not, it has furnished a dark system, which angels flee from and which devils inhabit. Every Lodge is a Synagogue of Satan and its ritual is Sorcery' 63 . Presidents of the United States are ro utinely 'honoured' by being made 33rd Degree Masons under the Scot tish Rites. Let this be re phrased: Presidents of the United States are routinely invited to engage in ritual sorcery. The 33rd Degree was conferred in the United States upon the son of the late Shah of Persia (Pahlavi), implying that it is intended that he should be restored in due course to his throne.

Of the parallel Masonic status of Colonel Qadhaffi there is no doubt at all. Writing in 1933, Lady Queenborough, who carried out research for British intelligence, stated without qualification that the 'Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites' runs its own Secret Service which cooperates with the national Secret Services of all countries, thus serving the aims and purposes of Internationalism' 64 . This practice is directly descended from the fact, cited earlier, that, from the outset, the Prussians used the New World's burgeoning Masonic network for espionage operations, and we re employing Jews for that purpose 65 . THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY AND OTHER ABOMINATIONS The essence of the internationalist revolutionary geomasonic agenda was exposed by another Jewish Mason, Paul Rosen, who in his work, also cited by Lady Queenborough, 'Satan et Cie', explicitly stated that the House of Lucifer seeks the total abolition of private property - that is to say, what follows clearly demonstrates the Masonic origins of Lenin's Communist World Revolution. Rose n, whose polemic entitled 'Satan and Company' (i.e., and his demons) was yet another of these Masons who are fully dedicated to the implementation of Lucife r's agenda, which of course focuses on the whole world, while at the same time exposing the fallacies of the methodology he is using. When the faux-allegorical garbage alluding to the assassinated Hiram Abiff, the make-believe legend invented by Masonry concerning th e murder of the architect of Solomon's Temple, is stripped away from the associated verbiage here (it cannot be removed from this passage otherwise the language does not flow), the underlying raw intent to grab the assets of the whole world is exposed: Official ritual of the 33rd and last Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites: 'For the Sovereign Grand Inspector Gene ral the 33rd is the last Degree of the Rite. The Order is the Great Avenger of the assassinated Grand Ma ster and the grand champion of humanity, for the innocent Grand Master is Man [not God - Ed.], Man who is Master, King of Nature, and wh o is born innocent and unconscious'. 'Our innocent Grand Master was born for happiness and for the enjoyment of all rights without exception. But he has fallen under the blows of three assassins, three scoundrels have thwarted his happiness and rights, and have annihilated him'. 'The three infamous assassins are Law, Property and Religion'. 'Law, because it is not in harmony with the rights of the individual man and the duties of social man in society, rights whic h belong to all. Duti es are but the immediate consequence of the right inherent in all, for the enjoyment of all rights'. 'Property, because the earth belongs to no body and its fruits belong to all in pro- portion as they are required by each for the needs of his own wellbeing'. 'Religion, because religions are but ph ilosophies evolved by men of genius and adopted by the people in the belief that they would increase their wellbeing'. 'Neither Law, Property nor Religion can be imposed on man and as they annihilate him by depriving him of his most precious right s they are assassins on whom we [sic] have sworn to wreak vengeance, enemies against whom we have declared war to the death and without quarter. Of these three infamous enemies it is on Religion that we must concentrate our most deadly attacks on, because no people has ever survived its religion. Once Religion is dead, Law and Property will fall to our mercy, and we shall be able to regenerate society by founding, on the corpses of the assassins of Man, Masonic Religion, Masonic Law, and Masonic Property'."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 303 So, from several Masonic 'horses' mouths, we can now state unequivocally, without fear of Masonic counterattack because it is the Masons' own spokesmen who have made the preceding statements, that: • Both formal and 'True' Religion are to be replaced by Masonic substitutes, and as has been seen, Freemasonry is sorcery. Therefore all religion is to replaced by sorcery. Note: This is impossible in the case of True Christianity, a fact these people don't 'get'. • Existing legal systems are to be replaced by an international Masonic legal system. Hence the orchestrated revolutionary confusion in the European Union context, where European Law (manufactured by the European Court of Justice, which does not exist to dispense justice, but specifically to further the interests of the corrupt Collective). • Private property is to be collectivised. It is intended that a mere 5% of the world's population will own assets, with the rest (to be culled by population reduction measures) reduced to a form of controlled slavery. It needs to be understood that this is the programme to which 33rd Degree Masons subscribe. They do so even as extremely wealthy owners of private property. Do they seriously believe that in such a destabilised, aggressive environment, they could hang on to their own assets? MORE ABOMINATIONS FROM A HORSE'S MOUTH Ralph Anderson, then a 32nd Degree Mason, sa id as follows in a speech in 1985, in which he mentioned a 'demonic spirit guide' which he called 'the Tibetan': 'A brief word about the future. The Tibetan [sic!] tells us: 'The three main channels through which the preparation of the New Age [of Aquarius, by which they mean after the total destruction of Christianity] is going on might be regarded as the church, the Masonic fraternity and the educational field. All of them are as yet [as of 1985] failing to meet the need and to respond to the inner pressure. But in al l of these three movements, disciples of the Great Ones [referring to 'the gods', i.e. demons] are to be found and they are steadily gathering momentum and will before long enter upon their designated task'. 'He tells us further [i.e., Mr Anderson's familiar, or 'guiding spirit', tells him - Ed.]: 'The Masonic Movement when it can be divorced from politics and social ends and from its present paralysing condition of inertia, will meet the needs of those who can, and should, wield power. It is the custodian of the law; it is the home of the Mysteries [i.e., the Ancient Mysteries of divination, sorcery and magick - Ed.] and the seat of initiation [which, for the Christian, is unnecessary and an abomination - Ed.]. It holds in its symbolism the ritual of Deity and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work. The methods of Deity are demonstrated in its Temples, and under the All-Seeing Eye the work can go forward. It is a far more occult organisation than can now be realised, and it is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists. In its ceremonials lies hid the wielding of the forces connected with the growth and life of the kingdoms of nature and the unfoldment of the divine aspects in Man. In the comprehension of its symbolism will come the power to cooperate with the divine plan. It meets the needs of those who work on the first Ray of Will or Power' 66 . This 'high-level' Masonic Illuminist statement - in which the Masonic sorcerer openly acknowledged that the programme of cultural subversion he is proclaiming was spelled out to him at a top-level sorcerers' seance, where it was 'revealed' to him that the Christian churches (rotten of course from within) would be subverted and then converted into instruments of the World Geomasonic-Illuminati Rosicrucian Revolution, ('The Universal Church of Man') - contained the furt her statement that 'Great Ones',"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"304 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer that is to say, corrupt disciples of Lucifer, who are driven by his 'seething energies' -were already operating deep within the churches, Freemasonry and education. With the passage of two decades since that statement was made, we can see how accurate these predictions, promulgated from a 'spirit guide ', have turned out to be. Churches are in confusion and are wracked by apostacy and scandal over female bishops and homosexuality; the Masonic movement, upon which the Illuminati have piggy-backed since the 18th century, controls all the high offices of state, of the judiciary, the intelligence services, the bureaucracies, politics and all the important levers of power; and the education system has been conver ted into a manipulative mind-personality modification and outcome-based propaganda m achine. Additionally, these sorcerers have commandeered the entire entertainment industry, the media, components of the Internet and the broadcasting organisations, by various means (especially corruption), ensuring that children are bombarded with pornography and are taught deviant sex at an early age. There is therefore nothing that Ralph Anderson's demon predicted that has not come to pass. Brought up in this environment, the minds of most British journalists are concentrated on trivia, the corrosive and sterile celebrity culture, gutter journalism and prurient, obsessive- destructive character-assassination reporting. INCOMPATIBILITY OF MASONR Y WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE Before briefly elaborating on the structure of Freemasonry and especially some of the seats of its administrative centres, a number of findings from our investigation to date are worth summarising at this stage. The Author uses his invented word, Geomasonry, to describe both the open structures of Freemasonry, and the secret societies - composing a global system of synarchy (rule or intended rule by secret societies) - which hide behind it. Authority for this statement is obtained once again from the writings of Lady Queenborough, who, noting that, to her knowledge, 'the last of the Grand Masters of the Rose Croix' operating as a stand-alone secret society was the Jew, Johann Christian Wolff, who, like many hyperactive Jews operating in intelligence on their own or a sovereign's account, carried the name 'Christian' to disguise his Jewish extraction. According to the Grand Lodge of England, proclamation of a document known as the Anderson Constitution under King George II marked and sanctioned the emergence of British Freemasonry into the open 67 . Anderson was one of seven overt 'founders ' of Freemasonry who were all Gnostics and Magi (sorcerers) of the Rose Croix, originally imported from 14th century Germany and elaborated by Sir Francis Bacon. The other six Rosicrucian sorcerers were Theophile Desaguliers (named Chaplain of the Prince of Wales by George II), George Payne, James King Calvert, Lumsden-Madden, and Elliott 68 . These Rosicrucians were heirs of the first sorcerer-gnostic dedicated to rivalry with - and the perversion or destruction of - True Christianity, Simon Magus. Rosicrucianism perpetuates the magick sorcery and mythology of 'the ancients' of the Babylonian Kabbalah, Egypt and the Druids; and it is Jewish. The most interesting mystery of all is encased in the fact that it is also German. Certain power-families operating and competing among themselves behind this screen, for global control, such as the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers a nd the Bushes, are originally from Germany, or else have deep German connections (historically), and are either Jewish or have intermarried with Jews. Once Freemasonry was out in the open, 'it was to be the universal screen behind which all secret societies, whether theurgic or political, would [come to] operate clandestinely' 69 . Since all intelligence agencies are basically occult secret societies - a fact with which a prominent and distinguished British analyst agreed, when"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 305 the proposition was put to him - intelligence agencies must be included among the large number of secret societies which function behind the screen of Freemasonry. \"Thus it came about, Lady Queenborough asserts, 'that all blows dealt to Christianity and [to] States were prepared by the secret societies, acting behind the veil of Masonry' 70 . Accordingly: • It is necessary to understand the 'screen function' of geomasonry in order to perceive correctly how the innumerable secret societies relate to it. Secret societies include not only intelligence services, but organised criminal communities with which they cooperate, such as Mazzini's M.A.F.I.A., the Chinese Triads, the Japanese Yakuza, and the myriad drug-running cartels including those established by US intelligence in Latin America and the two drug cartels controlled or facilitated by the British intelligence cadre GO-2 from within the bowels of that broadly treacherous internationalist intelligence organisation called MI6. Collaboration between intelligence communities, their fractions and controlling barons, and organised crime - since all are typically engaged in clandestine criminal operations (although of course there are many 'White-haf intelligence officers, too) - is one of the gravest and most intractable of the poisonous evils that bedevil our crumbling civilisation today; and since all who matter are corrupted, calls for root-and-branch reform, in such a corrupted environment, fall on stone-deaf ears. • Geomasonry - including of course attached, hidden Rosicrucianism - is the custodian of the Kabbalah, and is indeed a primary component of the faux-Jewish Synagogue of Satan referred to by Our Lord Jesus Christ as twice revealed to John, in Revelation, Chapter 2, verse 9: 'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan': and in Revelation, Chapter 3, verse 9: 'Behold... them of the Syna gogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie'. In order to bring out the 'screening' function of Freemasonry, this Author describes ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS 'OUTER' MANIFESTATION OF A PARTICULARLY REVOLTING ILLUMINATI SECRET SOCIETY The repulsive glorying in Satanic exhibitionism perpetra ted at the 51st Eurovision Song Contest on 20th May 2006 by a Finnish nutcase calling himself Lordi, represented an open display of what the Luc iferians have in mind, and intend. The platform used for this televised display of fi lth is one of many that has been annexed by Dark Actors Playing Games on behalf of the llluminati, as a means of spreading Satanism into the public domain. Over nine million brainwashed and misguided Britons watched this TV abomination, which was welc omed by 'Useful Idiot' talking heads as 'a victory for open-mindedness'. The me ssage here is that we should all open our minds to infestation by demons, and that such preoccupations, like pornography, are respectable 'these days'. One of the myriad secret societies pushing such Luciferian filth is Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O), an operation with German illuminati roots which is dealt with more fully from page 456. This secret society nesting 'behind' Freemasonry and mimicking it for its Satanic rites (it is less secret than it was, as it advertises today for members on the Internet), uses Masonic and occult symbols, including a triangle, sun-rays and the all-seeing eye [see Figure 69, page 457]. A German Jew named Karl Keller founded the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) - in German, Orientalischer Templer-Orden - around the turn of the 20th ce ntury, as a ritual magick cultural control and transformation organisation which has since acquired immense influence within the US military, intelligence community and the US space progamme. It te aches and promulgates sex-oriented magick derived from Greek mythological, Egyptian and K abbalah sources. The British intelligence officer, Aleister Crowley, the self- styled 'Great Beast 666' (who stole this title from its rightful owner: see Chapter 6) , who was called 'the Wickedest Man in the World' by the old British publication, John Bull, attached himself to the organisation and became head of its British affiliate, and ultimately the head of the organi sation - to which the alleged DVD agent George Bush Sr. allegedly belongs. To the heterosexual Ninth Degree Crowley added a homos exual Eleventh Degree, mingling his amendments to O.T.O.'s gobbledegook with the ritual laid down by P. B. Randolph of the US-based Fraternitas Rosae Crucis [see main text]. Crowley 'perfected' this ritual during three ye ars spent (1920-23) in the Abbey of Thelema in Sicily. In 1922, Aleister Crowley succeeded Theodore Reuss, a Jewi sh Berlin-based War Correspondent whose mail was held in London for him by Messrs Henry Klein & Co., at thei r offices in 84 Oxford Street, London. On Reuss's death in 1947, another German Jew, Karl Jo hannes Germer, succeeded to the outer headship of The Order (as of course it calls itself). Germer had operated with Crowley in Engl and, but had returned to his native Germany in the 1930s, despite his Jewish background. ■"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"306 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer Freemasonry alone as the House of Lucifer. In Chapter 7, the geomasonic sect of the Illuminati is described as the Synagogue of Sa tan, because this broader penetrating sect, originating in its modern format in Germany and with heavy Jewish content, consists of crime families and Masonic and non-Masonic memb ers of a large number of these secret societies (such as the Black Satanic sect Ordo Templi (Mentis [see box on page 305, and page 456], originally from Germany [Chapter 7]) free-riding behind the Masonic screen. Both categories recognise ea ch other through the use of secret hand signals, occult phrases and the use of Masonic and occult symbol s (as observed in the symbols of different branches of the US Federal Government, disp layed in Figures 48 and 49 on pages 289 and 293, and in the logos or Masonic colours of large multinational corporations). Nation states such as Nicaragua and El Salvador, and many other countries, which have long since been co-opted into the 'fraternity', have flags and symbols that are overtly Masonic, with triangles, circles, suns-and-rays, the lot. These symbols are deliberately upheld, to inform 'the interested' that the govern ment department, multinational corporation, or nation state in question orders its affairs in conformity with Masonic norms - meaning that it accepts all the 'standards' proclaimed by geomasonry. Since these include the abolition of private property and the degradation of civilised society, such adherence is completely at loggerheads with the interests of the government department, corporation or nation state concerned - an illogical state of affairs that seems to be accepted as 'normal', because such contradictions come naturally to the 'double-minded'. Whether these glaring contradictions reflect ignorance and confusion in the twisted minds of those respon sible for the relevant decisions, or whether they reflect the geomasonic 'secret knowledge' of the tension between the two 'opposing forces' or phanes (the dialectic), is really im possible to say. Who knows what goes on in the confused minds of these certifiably deluded madmen ? What can be said is that it should come as no surprise that these contradictions not only exist, but are openly advertised - since the Prince of this World, Lucifer, is the author of all lies and confusion. These people have eyes, but they cannot see. It will be recalled from page 274 that Dr Isaac M. Wise, writing in 'The Israelite' dated 3rd August 1855, asserted catego rically that 'Masonry is a Jewish institution whose history, Degrees, charges, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from the beginning to the end, with the exception of only one by-Degree and a few words in the obligation'. Other authorities, from Samuel Oppenheim to La dy Queenborough, separately concur. The by- Degree to which Dr Wise referred was NOT the Rose Croix. It follows from the assessments of these authorities alone that Rosicrucianism, encapsulating the sorcery of the Kabbalah, is likewise of Jewish origin. • Geomasonry conducts, in every Lodge, as has been affirmed, the rituals of Kabbalistic sorcery. To cite just one historical provenance of the introduction of overt sorcery into Masonic ritual, Moses Holbrook, the Jewish Grand Master or Sovereign Commander of the Supreme Council of Char leston, had earlier co-formed a project for creating a Satanic rite in which the adepts would be instructed in Black Magic; but Holbrook, who had already composed a suita ble ritual and sacreligious mass called the Adonaicide Mass (Adonay being these reprobates' name for Jesus Christ), had died, retarding completion of the project . Albert Pike fulfilled on a gigantic scale the 'dream of the Jew, Moses Holbrook, to subvert Masonry'. So Masonry was further, and irrevocably, impregnated with the full spectrum of Jewish Babylonian Kabbalistic sorcery, thanks mainly to the delusions of the occultist, Albert Pike 71 ."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 307 Figure 52: In the United States, Freemasonry, which is a slow-motion introduction and enticement to infestation and possession by Evil Spirit and is the road to perdition adopted by large numbers of men (and women} whose ignorance of the purpose of Freemasonry i s knowingly exploited by its controllers*, is separated into three groups. The foolish initiate starts by entering into the Blue Lodge (first three Degrees). He can then select either or both the York Rite and the Scottish Rite method of 'advancement' (Luciferian indoctrination). Later he can petition for membership of the Shrine, although this is now open to a much wider group of applica nts. An especially committed Mason who has wasted much of his life in these activities can be raised by the [witch]Craft leadership to the 33rd Degree. See Figure 51 on page 299 for details of selected US au xiliary Masonic bodies (of which there is a large number). Most people never look below the surface of anything, or prefer not to be troubled with the facts. But the reality is that several of the M asonic founders of the United States, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, were 'Deists'. The primary feature of this abe rration is that while God (whom Masons start by calling the Great Architect of the Universe) created everything, he then fell asleep or is olated Himself from the entire creation and allowed everything to operate on its own - a heresy which is the very essence of the teach ings of Freemasonry. By means of this device, an elite arrogates to itself the 'right', procured by means of occultic initiation rites, to become 'masters' of mankind, ordering its affairs on behalf of the 'Brotherhood of Man', which is code for the fraternity of 'the inte rested', i.e. those who have undergone the necessary secret initiations. Masons who think they can combine Christianity and Freemasonry are sadly deluded, and lost: 'Ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and followed Ba'alim... How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him, but if Ba'al, then follow him' [1 Kings, Chapter 18, verses 18-21]. 'No servant can s erve two masters: for either he will hate the one, an d love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon' [Luke, Chapter 16, verse 13]. Masonic participation is contrived to ensure that this truth is wiped from their mind s. THE STRUCTURES OF OVERT U.S. AND U.K. FREEMASONRY 'It is not intended that the initiate should understand; but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands': A. Pike"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"308 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer • 'Geomasonry' runs its own Secret Service which cooperates with the national Secret Services of all countries, thus serving the aims and purposes of Internationalism'. This Author submits, therefore, that not only are intelligence services occult secret societies, as mentioned, but that they are essentially merged with, complementary to, and impregnated with, Masonic networks worldwide, so that an y 'Chinese walls' erected within national intelligence services that may be intended co smetically to preserve national secrets, are easily penetrated, unreliable a nd vulnerable to being ignored. This means that Masonically- impregnated intelligence services, wh ich are all to a greater or l esser extent interpenetrated by competing domestic and foreign intelligen ce operatives, do not, and cannot, serve the national interests of the governments formally employing them, but can and must only serve the internationalist agenda. This, in turn, is clearly a Luciferian-Satanic agenda that can never be moulded to suit national interests, as nation states are intended by the geomasonic-Illuminati fraternity, which owes allegiance only to itself (leaving aside its allegiance to Lucifer), to be abolished. Given this state of affairs, it follows that all intelligence services pose a grave threat to the integrity and interests of the national governments to which they are supposed to be loyal. As has already been reported, one veteran se nior US intelligence expert told the Author that, when undertaking momentous and hazardous operations overseas on instructions received from the highest levels, he and his colleagues 'did not realise at the time' that they were not actually working for Uncle Sam, but were really working for the Illuminati. This is certainly the mo st 'illuminating' (and honest) first-hand evidence obtained by the Author to corroborate the assessments contained in this book. • Illuminised geomasonry is by definition lawless, harbouring an intention to replace all laws with its own - a fact that accounts for the ready, arrogant and self-acknowledged criminality of elements of certain intell igence services. After all, if a primary l ong-range objective of the geomasonic agenda is to undermine the law, why should we be surprised any longer that the US intelligence community routinely breaks domestic and international laws with relish and impunity, protected behind the barrier of the National Security Act of 1947 et seq.? Why should anyone be interested in the abominable fact that GO-2 controls two drug-trafficking cartels fro m MI6 headquarters in Lambeth, and with the proceeds supervises the illegal distribution of drug-derived money to the controlled British political parties and schools? So, these se cret societies calling themselves intelligence services, which purport to be working for thei r own governments, break the laws of their own and foreign governments - and yet rely upon the laws of their nation states when they want to enforce their own dark interests. One should never underestimate the vituperative venom and ruthlessly determined anger with which criminalised US intelligence operatives, for instance, rush to the law cour ts to proliferate false witness against fellow operatives with whom they are in murderous dispute - or against impertinent outsiders who, their paranoid minds imagine, threaten to disturb the criminalised environment which they are accustomed to exploit for their own personal benefit, as well as to enrich the intelligence community generally so that it operates as an untouchable power fa r beyond the reach and control of the Legislative Branch. • Geomasonry is determined to procure the abolition of all private property. It is accordingly unsurprising that bo th Britain and the United States have placed, and are placing, on their respective Statut e Books, dictatorial legislation providing inter alia for the arbitrary confiscation of private property without compensation: for that is exactly what is intended, once all levels of the oppressive infrastructure have been put in place,"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 309 and Soviet-style Communism (an Illuminati product) is ready to be imposed from above. This is the true Leninist meaning of the Soviet Academy of Leninist Sciences' word 'convergence'. In the United States, bankruptcy laws were overturned with effect from 17th October 2005, so that the authorities acquire d the power to seize the assets of those individuals who would formerly have filed for bankruptcy. • Geomasonry is the ruthlessly determined enemy of True Christianity, and seeks to annexe and reorientate all false and apostate fo rmal religious organisations, not least as one means of undermining the family, which is the key to destroying private property (according to the distorted, brainwashed 'thinking' of these people). Mikhail Gorbachev's reiteration of the geomasonic war on religion, which must be won before 'Communism' can be imposed and consolidated, was summarised in his statement on 15th December 1987 in Uzbekistan: 'There must be no let-up in the war against religion because as long as religion exists Communism cannot prevail. We must intensify the obliteration of all religions wherever they are being practiced or taught'. Gorbachev is a Jew, whose real name is Orbach or Korbach. 'Religion' has to be 'abolished', a nd yet Masons refer to their gobbldegook as the 'Masonic Religion'- revealing yet again the double-minded Satanic lies, chaos and confusion inherent in their own perverted logic, which is based 100% on cynicism and deception. At the same time, it is clear that , since the intelligence services are united and merged with, and duplicated by, geomasonry, a nd are de facto servants of the Illuminati, they are by definition likewise anti-religious and thus inherently ill-disposed towards Scripture, and the Way, the Truth and the Life. Certain US intelligence cadres are interested in 'organised religion' solely as yet another transmission mechanism for 'the transformation of humanity'. • The greatest importance is attached by the 'hidden' Illuminati geomasonic controllers to esoteric preoccupations: At the highest levels, this involves elaborate operations to manipulate the mass consciousness, with a watchful All-Seeing Eye, by means of a network of intelligence-linked organisations and power brokers that were 'described by Walter Bowart in his 1978 classic work, 'Operation Mind-Control', as the \"Cryptocracy\". The Cryptocracy is not a myth; it seeks to transform humanity through an alchemical processing of the mass consciousness or Group Mind which involves various tests and corresponding responses through channels linked to secret societies' 72 - the same synarchy that operates behind the screen of Freemasonry. 'The result is both psychological and cultural control; but, more importantly, transformation. The Cryptocracy has essentially kept the mind of the masses cooking in a cauldron like a Rena issance alchemist, and occasionally tastes, adds ingredients, and stirs' 73 . The consequences of this relentless offensive can be seen by contemplating the truly appalling condition of the British press, which, within the sp ace of just a few months in 2005, descended almost in uni son into the far depths, filling pages with sterile scandal, celebrity 'junk news', salacious gossip, empty editorialising, fatuously superficial argumentation, a sharp reduction of international reporting, open advocacy for the drug culture, and other aberrations too numerous to list - with no diminution of the familiar British journalistic opinionated arrogance. Two further dimensions of geomasonry remain to be considered. First, as a means of gaining an understanding of the heterogeneous make-up of this false 'religion', and showing how its Luciferian progenitors have cherry-picked occult sorcery rites and inventions from several primary occult sour ces, a summary of the origins of the 33 Degrees of just the 'Ancient and Accepted Scot tish Rite' (America) and of the 'Ancient and Accepted Rite' (England), will be helpful.

Secondly, an outline of the global geomasonic control mechanisms, and their locati ons in Europe, not the United States, will shed further light on the 'division of powers' between Pike and Mazzini. Concerning the second point, close advisers of the Author who are in touch with operatives possessing 'the highest clearance' - which means intelligence clearances that are higher than that of the President of the Unite d States, namely occult clearances - are adamant, and the Author agrees, that the primary oc cult geomasonic controll ing power centres are located in Europe, not the United States. This would be consistent with our knowledge that the United States is an experimental cons equence of a German-originated Rosicrucian operation originally spearheaded by Sir Francis Bacon whose ultimate loyalty was not to the British Sovereign. It is also consistent with th e fact [see below] that the primary geomasonic aclministrative centre was and remains Berlin. This reality is paralleled by the importance of the Vatican as a geopolitical centre of the Illu minati, consolidated since Giuseppe Mazzini assumed total control over 'poli tical action' in Rome. Given the involvement of European current and former Royalty, such sources say that 'the Europeans are fighting it out among themselves' - with the Germans prevailing. THE STRUCTURE OF JEWISH SCOTTISH RITE ROSICRUCIAN FREEMASONRY Lady Queenborough provides the following breakdown of the overt 'origins' of the 33 Degrees of the 'Scottish Rite' dimension of ge omasonry. She prefaced this breakdown with the statement that 'John H. Cowles, Supreme Grand Commande r for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, 1929, stated that 'this rite, of Jewish origin, has 33 Degrees' 74 , which are named as follows: • Symbolic or Blue Masonry: The Cr aft Degrees, which are practically the same in the United States as under the Grand Lodge of England, Scotland and Ireland, consist of: 1: Entered Apprentice; 2: Fellow Craft; 3: Master Mason: All of Jewish origin. In these Degrees, candidates are lied to and comprehensively deceived and misled. 'It is not intended that [the Blue Degree Mason] shall understand [the false interpretations]. But it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them': Albert Pike. The overt 'origins' of the subsequent 30 Degrees are indicated in italics where known: • Red Masonry or Chapters: These Degrees are conferred in a so-called Lodge of Perfection, and the presiding officer must be of the 16th Degree, at least. Although, as has been reviewed, both Jewish and Gentile authorities explicitly confirm that the Scottish Rite Degrees and rituals are of Jewish origin, th is origin is technically 'disguised' by intel ligence to the effect that a sign ificant proportion of them are asserted to be 'of Illuminati origin': but this 'comes to the same thing', since the Illuminati are also extensively Jewish and wedded to the Kabbalah. The Illuminati set out in the late 18th century to penet rate and piggy-back on open Freem asonry, as well as to use Freemasonry as a screen behind which to carry out their global he gemony 'mission' wh ich German 'forces' have consistently used as cover for Germany's transnational hegemony objective (the Thousand-Year Reich). Je wish Masons 'worked over' all the 'workings' and con solidated the Jewishness of this elaborate trap set for Christians. As will also be noted, a number of the higher Degrees are of Templar or igin; but the Templars at times controlled Rosicrucian rituals 75 . It can also be seen that all these sorcery strands are interrelated."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 311 4: Secret Master. Of Illuminati origin. 5: Perfect Master.

By contrast, the Kabbalistic 'Tree of Life' that is unfolded to adepts in, for instance, the 18th (Rosicrucian) Degree of the Scottish (Jewish) Rite, is in fact that same Tree of Life that wa s growing in the Garden of Eden, of the fruit of which Eve ate, which teaches how to evoke evil spirits and Satan himself. Since Satan is the author of all lies, the 'truth' purveyed via the 'Ancient Mysteries' revealed by eating the fruit of the 'Tree of Life' is a lie - leading not to lif e, as with Christ, but to the opposite: death. The Tree of Life is itself a lie: it is The Tree of Death.

ASSERTED ORIGINS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SCOTTISH RITE The 'Scottish Rite' emerged, according to the French historian Le Forestier, 'from the Chapter of Clermont, as a development of the Ramsay Rite. Its foundation dates from 1748, at which period it was introduced into Germany by Count de Schmettau 80 . However, as with so much Masonic writing, which deals in lies and make-believe, much of which is floated in order to assist the process of obfuscation (since Masons are themselves routinely intended to be deceived, as Albert Pike argues, by fellow Masons), this is contradicted by a separa te source, which asserts that 'The Premier Conclave of England, which has existed from ti me immemorial, gave rise, it is said, to the foundation of the 'Council of the Emperors of the East and We st', a body which was established in Paris by Chevalier de Bonneville about th e year 1758 and is considered as the parent of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite' 81 . A brief recapitulation of the 'Morin' issue is appropriate here, to show not least how freemasonry thrives amid its own chaos: In 1761, the Lodges and Councils of the Superior Degrees having by then been extended throughout Europe, 'Frederick II (Fre derick the Great), Ki ng of Prussia, as Grand Commander of the Order of Princes of the Royal Secret, or 32 Degrees, was by general consent acknowledged and recognized as Sovereign and Supreme Head of the Scottish Rite' [see pages 297 et seq].

In March 2003, 'Esquire' magazine published an article entitled 'The Pentagon's New Map', by Thomas P. M. Barnett, of the US Naval War College, the Masonic emblem of which is shown in Figure 49 (T) on page 293. This article, which displayed the map in question, indicated that the Pentagon (on behalf NOT of the United States but of the secret Ne w (Under)World Order-lllumina ti remit) has divided the world into two segments. It should be noted that the month in which this article appeared was the same month as the launch of the Second Iraq War which, consequent upon the resistance organised by Sovi et Military Intelligence (GRU), has proved disastrous. It is not known whether, as a resu lt of that reckless and illegal venture, US strategy has been appropriately modified, but the likelihood is that it has not, although the chaos in Iraq has delayed implementation of further steps. • The Functioning Core: Nations that are already functioning within the 'Global System' or which are known to be moving in the intended direction due to past blackmail, bribery and corruption ops; and: • The Non-Functioning Gap/a.k.a. the Non-Integratin g Gap: Countries that are not yet functioning as demanded within the Global System and which are unlikely to do so in the foreseeable future, unless jack- booted into compliance by US (the article adds: 'or European') military forces, or by t he threat of invasion. The clearly inspired article by a US military intelligence officer bragged, ahead of the launch of the invasion of Iraq: 'Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historic tipping-point - the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization'. This globalisation offensive was in fact planned in 1776, but no-one today is supposed to understand this central fact underpinning the reality that the United States is an 'irreversibly' revolutionary power, endowed with instructions from its European geomasonic 'controllers' to impose the 'New World' Order that was to be established initially in the United States, ultimately upon the whole world. When this Rosicrucian scheme, borrowed from Germany, was first elaborated by Sir Francis Bacon and associates in the 17th century, Bacon had despaired of any prospect of its anti-church globalist-esoteric 'ideals' being insta lled in 'old Europe', so they turned their attention to the 'New World' where a New Order, c onsistent with the aspirations and intentions of members of The Order of the Quest' could, they assumed, be rea lised: and these instructions were incorporated into the symbology of the Great Seal of the United States. The first part of the 'Esquire' article contained the familiar disinformation, alleging that 9/11 had 'necessitated' a 'war on terror' which had not been 'necessary' previously, even though the Author's files show that a preoccupation with terrorism has been central to US and other Western Governments' 'strategies' for several decades. The rest of the article, though, revealed exactly where future wars were intended to be waged - in order to jump-start 'N on-Functioning Gap' countries into compliance with the 'New (Under) World Order'. The United States has been instrumental in all wars of the 20th and 21st centuries. The accompanying map identified the 'Non-Functioning Co re' as a huge area of the world spanning part (but not all) of Central America, plus Bolivia and Peru, the whole of Africa with the exception of South Africa, much of East Asia, Taiwan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Kazakhstan (obviously not 'integrated' by 2003) and the Soviet Central Asian states, Iran, almost the entire Middle East Turkey and the whole of former Yugoslavia (implying that the llluminati's odious wars there have not procured the intended outcome). Those c ountries in Central America such as El Salvador and Nicaragua, with their 'in-your-face' geomasonic flags, and many countries in Africa and elsewhere which use Masonic symbols in their flags such as Ghana and Libya, were, in March 2003, evidently still not considered to have been 'integrated'. The article actually listed those countries that the Pentagon, secretly implementing the 'New World' Order plan, considered to be 'Non-Integrating' - namely, the Caribbean Rim, virtually the whole of Africa, the Balkans, the Caucasus (which is odd, given the US takeover of G eorgia), Central Asia and the whole of the Middle East excluding Israel, plus Southwest and Southeast Asia. Of course, such gran diose plans are doomed to failure. But the article stripped the veil from the llluminist mentality prevailing in Washington, which reflected the continuing impact of illusions on the basis of which America was founded. ■"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"314 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer Presidency of Chaillon de Joinville, the representative of Fred erick the Great and Substitute General of The Order, which authoris ed him to travel to America as the Grand Inspector General for the New World. It is Morin, as we have seen, who founded the American dimension of the Scottish Rites. Mori n claimed to have received his authority from the Comte de Clermont, who at the request of a man called Lacorne, had charged him (Morin) with establishing Masonry throughout the world. Apparently Lacorne derived his 'powers' as a consequence of the negligence of the Comte de Clermont who, in 1744, had ceased to take much interest in the Lodges a nd had delegated his authority to this dancing master fellow, and to a Jewish banker calle d Baure (Bauer). Lacorne was evidently a 'dancing master' who sold charters and Degrees to supplement his teaching activ ities. On 25th October 1762, the Grand Masonic Constitutions were finally ratified in Berlin, seat of Frederick the Great, and were proclaimed as th e governing instructions and mechanism for all Masonic bodies working in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry-sorcery, across two hemispheres. In the same year, the Constitutions were transmitted to Morin 82 . According to the analyst John Yarker, 'He (Morin) probably - ignorant charlatan as he was - mistook Frederick II, Grandson of Barbarossa, an actual King of Jerusalem, for his contemporary Frederick II of Prussia 83 . This narrative indicates that Morin's Masonic 'authority' was much less well-founded than he claimed, which was why it was 'revoked'. The history of the French line of Freemasonry is equally confused, due to incessant quarrelling; but somehow in 1766, under the auspices of a newly established Grande Loge de France, subsequently renamed the Grand-Or ient, a form of representative governance was at last adopted in an attempt to curb the constant bickering (which is the norm among crooks and liars). However the quarrels continued, 'with the Grand-Orient and the original Grand Lodge each being 'supported by a separate Rosicrucian organisation besides its own proper Lodges' 84 , revealing the central role exer cised by the Rosicrucian source and tradition of sorcery. To this Rosicrucian dimension was soon added Illuminism itself, given that, according to the later Masonic writer D. Margiotta, Adam Weishaupt, 'founder' of the Illuminati, and his favourite, Baron von Knigge, introduced something called 'the organisation of the Holy Vehm as well as certain legends of Illuminism into French Masonry in 1783'. The Holy Vehm appears to have been some kind of variant of the Inquisition, used in a non-Papal context. Lady Queenborough added, begging many questions, that 'the only persons exempted from the jurisdiction of this terrible court of \"Justice\", the Holy Vehm, were the clergy, women and children, Jews and heathens, and certain members of the higher nobility' 85 . In a revealing passage, Blanchard, who wa s himself a cynical Mason and called his fellow Masons 'dupes' but managed to disc uss his subject accurately, wrote citing the Masonic author Mackey, as follows: 'The one \"mission and object\" of Masonry is kept steadily in view; which is the worship of the g od of this world [= the Prince of this World - Ed.], who is Satan, as the 'Grand Architect of the Universe'; and to accomplish this by inventing a 'religion in which all mankind agree' [pantheism and syncretism: 'The Universal Church of Man' - Ed.]; and this, by putting all earth's religions upon a level, and uniting them together in Masonic worship, which is boldly avowed in rituals, lexicons, and philosophical Degrees. This is (in Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 14) called the image of the beast, made by \"them that dwell on the earth\", that is everybody; every creed, and no creed; all who join the secret Lodges. But this world-religion must have some form, and shape, to hold together; and be taxed; hence, it takes the form, or image, of the beast. Lodge despotism is as absolute as Romish des-"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 315 potism, and is the image of it...'[this being a reference to the fact that the overall 'pretext' for the creation of this syncre tist 'religion' was revulsion at the excesses and dogma of the Roman Catholic Church - Ed.]. 'Note how the Craft, by which this is to be accomplished, viz., Masonry, promises men salvation by ceremonies invented by men, administered by priests, and inhabited by devils. This is the sum and substance of all the false religions on earth, and will ultimately unite them against Christ. But the only opponent Masonry dreads is Jesus Christ, who refused to worshi p Satan, and his followers' 86 . The importance of this last statement cannot be over-emphasised. For this is not a True Christian writing: Blanchard was an avowed enemy of Christians, a historian of Masonry. ASSERTED ORIGINS OF THE YORK RITE, DRUGS AND SEX WORSHIP It will have been observed that ten of the 'higher or Black Masonry Degrees are ostensibly of Templar origin, albeit that, at the same time, all are of Jewish origin, since, as Dr Wise stated in 1855 (and others have reiterated) 'masonry is a Jewish institution whose history, Degrees, charges, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from the beginning to the end...'. Given reports of paedophilia and extreme debauche ry at exalted official levels in Britain and America, it is as well to recall that ha ving forgotten their real purpose and embraced Gnosticism while in Palestine, the Templars, who were in touch with the 'Assassins' and thus with their drug-driven culture, degenera ted and resorted to organised debauchery. According to Blanchard, the cynical Masonic writer whose work is cited by Lady Queenborough, several of the founders of the Templar Order, established in 1118 by Hugh de Payens with 13 Degrees - as has its modern successor, the York Rite - were initiates of the pagan, drug-dealing sect of the 'Assassi ns'. Blanchard reported, in 'Knights Templarism Illustrated', that 'During the Middle Ages, the most eminent warriors and noblemen of Europe entered its ranks. The Knights of the Temple became the bulwark of the Holy Land against the Saracens. France, Engla nd and other countries formed associations (Priories) of Templar Knights, each with its own Grand Master and other officers. Such great wealth was accumulated in the treasuries of The Order [inter alia and probably mainly through levies on pilgrims to the Holy Sites - Ed.] that in the year 1185 its annual income represented a sum equal to thirty millions of dollars. The Templars were bankers' [more accurately, having accumulated such large surplu s, they started lending out their surpluses on usurious terms]. 'But wealth and prosperity naturally led to lice ntiousness, neglect of Templar law and in the end, destruction' 87 . However their destruct ion, not reviewed here, was not permanent, as much recent literature has explained. Under the influence of the 'Assassins', the Templars resorted to the practice of Phallicism, or sex-worship, in accorda nce with the regional tradition, and adopted Satanism, venerating 'The Baphomet', the idol of the Luciferians. The crime of sodomy became a rite of Templar initiation, as is the case in the initiation rites of the Yale-b ased Skull and Bones sect, one of the Templars' successors [see Chapter 2]. The outline of the Templars' formal 'disappearance', which forms the basis of most modern knowledge, was summarised by a source c onsulted by Lady Queenborough thus: 'In the year 1307, the Grand Ma ster of The Order, Jacques de Molay, was arrested in Paris with sixty of his knights and imprisoned upon charges of idolatry and other crimes' levied against them by the Papal Inquisition's instructions to the French authorities. 'Shortly afterwards, all the Knight s Templar in France were put in prison in Paris. On 10th May 1310, 54 of them were bu rned alive. On 13th March 1314, the Grand Master, with three of his most eminent officers, suffered in like manner. The great"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"316 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer possessions of The Order' - which had invested heavily in the property market - 'were now confiscated and the society [was] suppressed both by the Pope and by the leading monarchs of Europe' 88 . In England, the Knights Templar were dissolved in the reign of Edward II, and after the grant of their prope rties to the Knights Hospitallers, these in their turn were dissolved by Henry VIII' w ho got the idea of seizing such properties from his knowledge of the Templar precedent. After the death of de Molay, elements of the Knights Templar fleet st ationed in the Mediterranean sailed through the Straits of Gibraltar and found one protector in King Dinis II of Portugal, who reformed The Order in 1317, relabelling them the Knights of Christ. There is a considerable literature which reveals, in much detail, how the Templars also found refuge and freedom in the Kingdom of Scotland, and in Ireland. A large number of place-names all over the British Isles testify to the Templars' extensive property interests and settlements there. But this investigation is beyond the scope and remit of the present work. It has been rudely asserted that [Masonic history is] a department of history which is not only obscure and highly controversial, but by ill luck the happiest of all hunting grounds for the light- headed, the fanciful, the unscholarly, and the lunatic fringe of the British Museum Reading Room 89 . The overt successor network of the Templars, called the York Rite, has, as noted, 13 Degrees, which correspond to those used by the Templars. These are also the stated original source for ten Scottish Rite Degrees. It is confusing to be told by reliable sources that there are various origins for these Degrees, while at the same time all are Jewish. However, this 'pr oblem' disappears when it is recognised that the Kabbalistic content of the Templar Degrees can only have been procured from the Babylonian Jewish tradition, with which the Templars were in the closest contact during their predatory opera tions in Palestine. THE DIVISION OF LABOUR BETWEEN PIKE AND MAZZINI The two later fathers of 'modern' high Maso nry, who together established the governing structures, were Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian revolutionary, M.A.F.I.A. king-pin and friend of Karl Marx, and Albert Pike, who ap peared to have been Satanised during the American Civil War, when he was a Brigad ier-General in the Confederate Army. As Governor of Indian territory, Pike force-crea ted an army of Indian warriors composed of Chickasaws, Comanches, Creeks, Cherokees, Miamis, Osages, Kansas and Choctaws; and under Pike's command, these Indian hordes indulged in 'an orgy of murder and atrocities so terrible that foreign powers interfered. Representations made by England, threatening intervention in the name of hum anity, finally compelled Jefferson Davis to disband his auxiliary Indian troops' 90 . Mazzini had approached Pike, impressed by Pike's success in consolidating and controlling (unofficial) Freemasonry in the United States, and also impressed by the great power that the late Lord Palmerston, the Brit ish Prime Minister, who had died in 1866, had exercised worldwide, which Mazzini had attr ibuted to Palmerston's personal influence with Masonic chiefs. However since Giuseppe Mazzini surmised that the way Freemasonry was organised was inefficient, he set about studying how to organise it internationally; and in 1870, Ma zzini reached agreement with Pike for the creation of the Supreme Rite. This was to be the supreme, super-secret, controlling mechanism, permeated with and dedicated to occultism - tasting of the 'Tree of Knowledge' (a.k.a. The Tree of Life, a.ka. Tree of Death) and engaged in invoking evil spirits and Satan himself. Under the accord, Pike awarded himself, and was given, dogmatic authority and the title of Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freema sonry, while Mazzini retained executive"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 317 authority with the title of Sovereign Chief of Political Action. Mazzini pressed Pike to draw up the Statutes and the Grades of the new Su preme Secret Rite, which were intended to provide the liturgical bonds for the members of centralised 'High' Masonry. Pike named this manifestation of 'The Order', the New and Reformed Palladian Rite, or New and reformed Palladium. Remember that the Masonic word 'Palladium' means, according to another Masonic authority (cited by Lady Queenborough): 'One ruling like a King the Phallus being a universal emblem of Kings; from Pala, Hindoo for the male organ'. As previously mentioned, 'The Order of the Palladium' was orginally founded in 1730, shortly after which year it was introduced in Charleston, where it remained inactive until 1886, when Pike revived and renamed it as indicated, giving a 'new impulse' (i.e., releasing further 'seething energies of Lucifer') to the practice of 'High Masonry'. The Palladium remains little understood, as the number of its members is strictly limited, and, according to Stevens (cited by Lady Queenborough), 'the deepest secrecy surrounds all its deliberations' 91 . However it is known that among the 'higher' (= of course 'lower' spiritually) Degrees of The Order of the Palladium, as this Rite complex is also called, are 'Adelphos' and 'Companion of Ulysses' for men, and 'Penelope' for women, all with connotations of Hades. According to the cited authoritative 19th century geomasonic author and 'High Mason' Domenico Margiotta: 'It was agreed that the existence of this Rite would be kept strictly secret and that no mention of it would ever be made in the assemb lies of the Lodges and Inner Shrines of other rites, even when by accident, the meeting might happen to be composed exclusively of Brothers having the perfect initiation; for the secret of the new institution was only to be divulged with the greatest caution to a chosen few belonging to the 'ordinary' high grades 92 . To recruit adepts, Margiotta wrote, 'they planned to use some members of the other rites, but in the beginning they meant to rely principally on those among the initiates of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rites who were already addicted [sic] to occultism' 93 . 'It was particularly the initiates of the Thirty-Third Degree Scottish Rites, who, owing to their extensive international ramifications, were privileged to recruit adepts for Palladism. That is why the Supreme Rite [of Palladism] created its Triangles (the name given to Palladian Lodges) by Degrees, but these were established on a firm base, the lowliest of its initiates being Brothers long tested in ordinary Masonry' (i.e., long since Satanised). For the absolute elimination of all doubt that Palladian Masonry elevates Lucifer to the godhead and equates Jesus Christ with the Devil, Margiotta elaborated: 'Palladism is essentially a Luciferian rite. Its religion is Manichean neo-Gnost-icism, teaching that the divinity is dual and that Lucifer is the equal of Adonay (Jesus Christ), with Lucifer, the God of Light and Goodness struggling for humanity against Adonay the God of Darkness and Evil' (Satanic reversal - Ed.). 'In stating this principle of the secret cult of the Triangles, Albert Pike had only specified and unveiled the dogmas of the high grades of all other Masonries, for in no matter what Rite, the Great Architect of the Universe is not the God worshipped by the Christians' 94 . It is important to emphasise the significance of Domenico Margiotta's statement that, in revealing the essence of the 'secret cult of the (Palladian) Triangles', Albert Pike had 'only specified and unveiled the dogmas of the high grades of all other Masonries'. This statement provides 100% further confirmation that the 'Supreme Being' worshipped by ALL MASONIC MANIFESTATIONS, which is to say, ALL the compartmentalised components of the Illuminist Freemasonic synarchy ('The Order'), is 'that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan', and that theirs is an idolatry of pagan occultic sex."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"318 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer THE SUPER-SECRET SUPREME GEOMASONIC CONTROL MECHANISM The super-secret, central controlling power of the Palladian Rite's global network of 'Triangles' was exposed by Marg iotta in the following explanation, which confirms that the Palladian Rite is an, if not THE, apparatus of (Satanic) control: 'For other reasons, these precautions were still necessary, in order to render possible the exercise of a supreme central directing power, reaching all the rites through the personal influence of the Elects and Perfect Initiates, these being invested with privileges, and giving the impulse, which emanated from the source of the highest universal authority. If Brothers, not fully initiated, had suspected the existence of this supreme organization, it is evident that, in the ordinary Lodges, there w ould always have been a tendency to resist the motions of such privileged persons'. 'To ensure the creation and good working of this formidable machine of Palladism, Mazzini had reserved for himself the office of Ch ief of Political Action, nor had he hesitated in bowing to the will of the Patriarch of Charl eston who, by his preponderance in Scottish Rites, could easily penetrate all countries of th e globe with this new institution. That is the reason for Mazzini giving supremacy to the dogmatic [i.e., the jurisdiction of formalised Satanic sorcery and the gobbldegook surrounding such activ ities as the evocation of spirits supervised by Pike - Ed] over the political authority in International Freemasonry'. 'The Holy See of the Dogma for the wh ole [geo]masonic world was set up in Charleston [on the 33rd parallel - Ed.], the sacred city [sic!] of the Palladium. Pike, the Sovereign Pontiff of Lucifer, was the President of the Supreme Dogmatic Directory, composed of ten Brothers of the highest grades who formed his Supreme Grand College of Emeritus Masons. The Sovereign Executive Directory of High Masonry was established at Rome under Mazzini himself' 95 . The CIA Rezident for Vatican City, the smallest sovereign state in the world, briefs the Pope every Friday. Opus Dei [see Chapter 6] a ne farious 'secret Catholic organisation using the Rosicrucian rose as one of its symbols [see Fi gure 62, page 395], with intelligence tentacles, authorised by Pope John Paul II even though previous Popes had refused to sanction its 'legality' (not surprisingly, give n its focus, at the lowest level, on abuses such as flagellation of the body, which the Lord teaches us is th e temple of the Holy Spirit), is extremely influential within the US intelligence community and in Washington DC - where senior spooks take special pride in thei r membership, perhaps because it provides a convenient 'Jesus' cover for their black personal ities and souls. For instance, Robert Philip Hanssen, described as 'the most dangerous double agent in FBI history', delighted in the prestige that his membership of Opus Dei provided him, as well as its 'cover properties'. Mr Hanssen was sentenced to languish as a prisoner for life deep inside an underground bunker beneath special control structures in Denver, Colorado, and it was reported that he would never be allowed out - an indication of the peculiar cruelty meted out by the US intelligence community to its own personnel w ho go astray. In reality, the Author was informed in 2005 that 'all is forgiven' and he is a free man, living on the West Coast. As his biographer, David A. Vise, wrote on the very first page of his book 'The Bureau and the Mole' 96 : 'The Hanssens... relished the church's [St Catherine of Siena Church, Great Falls, Virginia] close ties to Opus Dei, an elite and influential movement within the Catholic Church, and delighted in praying alongside some of the most powerful people in Washington. More members of Opus Dei attended St Catherine's than any other church in the region. And several of its parishioners sent their boys to the Heights School in"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 319 Potomac, Maryland, an Opus Dei academy...' 97 or youth indoctrination centre. As indicated, the headquarters of Luciferi an sorcery ritual dogma for the Palladian control structures governing gl obal Masonry, according to the sources consulted, is based in Charleston, on the 33rd parallel. The executive or administrative headquarters for these structures was established by Albert Pike's European collaborator, Guiseppe Mazzini, in the Eternal City of Rome, the location of the Holy See, the headquarters of Catholicism, which does not faithfully propagate True (Biblica l) Christianity, but in part 'another Christ'. As Paul wrote to the church at Corinth [in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 11, verses 3-4]: 'But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit... or another gospel... ye might well bear with him'. And that is what happened. When Jesus was arraigned before Pontius P ilate [John, Chapter 18, verses 35-36], and Pilate, bewildered, asked the Lord: 'What hast thou done?', 'Jesus answered: 'My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from thence'. It is glorious to read a little further: 'Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice'. Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?' - the most important qu estion in the world, left unanswered: for he was face to face with the bearer of Truth 98 . However Pope John Paul II, for instance, spent his Papacy making pronouncements on the affairs of this world. As a world politician masquerading as the representative of Jesus Christ, and sitting in His place, diverting attention from Him and from from 'the simplicity that is in Christ', Pope John Paul II claimed the right to be at the epicentre of a 'uniting' Europe (even though, on the basis of all non-ideological criteria, the European Union Collective has predictably been a catastrophic failure). In his book, published in 1990, entitled 'The Keys of this Blood', the Author's late friend, Malachi Martin wrote: 'What captures the unwavering attention of the secular leaders of the world in this remarkable network of the Roman Catholic Church is precisely the fact that it places at the personal disposition of the Pope a supranational, supra-continental, supr a-trade-bloc structure that is so built and orientated that if tomorrow, by a sudden miracle [sic], a one-world government were established, the Roman Church would not have to undergo any essential change to retain its dominant position to further its global aims' 99 . Given the worldly orientation of the Papacy, behind its facade of false religiosity, and given the history of papal aberrations and debauchery, it is no accident that the executive seat of the Palladian (Phallic) Luciferian control structure was established by the sorcerer Pike's Luciferian associate, the criminal drug-dealer, revolutionary and mafia godfather, Giuseppe Mazzini, at Rome. However the 'seething organisational powers' of Lucifer had not yet completed the Luciferian control framework that was to be put in place, to confuse matters, quite separately from the later establishment of the super-secret Palladian Rite structures. According to Margiotta: 'The two secret chiefs, Pike and Mazzini, finally completed the organisation of High Masonry, establishing four Grand Central Directories for the whole world, functioning thenceforth to gather information for the benefit of their political policy and dog-"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"320 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer matic propaganda. These were: The Grand Central Directories for North America located at Washington; for South America, at Montevideo, Uruguay; for Europe, at Naples; and for Asia and Oceania, at Calcutta. Later, a Central Sub-Directory for Africa was founded at Port Louis, Mauritius; and following the death of Mazzini, the Supreme Chief constituted a new Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory at BERLIN which ranked in the hierarchy after the Sovereign Executive Directories and before the four Great Central Directories' 100 . This was, of course, the same central co ntrol location as had been confirmed when Frederick the Great, as Grand Commander of The Order of Princes of the Royal Secret, presided over ratification of the Grand Masonic Constitutions on 28th October 1762. So the 'Morin' breach dividing American Scottish Rite Masonry from the authorised European 'line' was finally healed - at the 'High' Masonry Palladian Rite level - by the two evil scoundrels, Pike and Mazzini. Palladism is, however, separated from the administrative functions of the Directories. THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE OF THE SCOTTISH AND PALLADIAN CENTRES The Palladian Rite structures were essentia lly a super-secret 'add-on' which came into being some time after the consolidation of th e main Scottish Rite control centres. But sub- sequently, for practical purposes, the Scottish Rite and the secret Palladian Rite structures appear to have been directed from the th ree main de facto geomasonic power centres itemised below. Certainly, the order of precedence of the structure of geomasonry, intended to be the super-secret global control mechanism, was exposed by the 33rd Degree Italian Jewish Mason Domenico Margiotta, and can be summarised as follows: 1. ROME: Sovereign Executive Directory of High Masonry: The seat of the Sovereign Chief of Political Action: The intended administrative centre of the World Revolution. Note: Notwithstanding Margiotta's observation that Charleston is 'superior to' Rome, the Author has placed the Executive Centre ABOVE the Charleston Dogmatic Centre, reversing the opinion the American 'High Masons' have of their own superiority and importance, for a reason that will become very apparent later in this work 2. CHARLESTON: Supreme Dogmatic Directory, seat of the Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry: The Scottish Rite/Palladian Dogmatic Centre. The Supreme Dogmatic Directory, where rituals of sorcery are supervised and from where they are promulgated, was composed of 'ten Brothers of the highest grades who form(ed) the Supreme Grand College of Emeritus Masons', as already explained. 3. BERLIN: Universal Sovereign Administrati ve Directory: The relationship of the Berlin Directory to the Rome Directory is not elucidated in the literature, but since Berlin ranks in the hierarchy ABOVE the Naples Direct ory, it is certainly more powerful: indeed, it is believed to be of exceptional importan ce, having been so ever since the days of Frederick the Great; and, to this day, BERLIN is the locus of Satanic events involving key geomasonic figures including some internationally prominent political operatives. The Berlin Directory functioned by means of a constantly renewed rotating Committee of Seven [see page 321] taken from the 'Supreme Councils, Grand Encampments, Grand Orients, and Grand Lodges of the World'. Two special delegates are permanently attached to the Berlin Directory, one for Finance and the other for Pr opaganda, both of whom are obliged to live in Germany, and to be in a sufficiently independent position to be able to attend at the seat of the Berlin Directory at a moment's notice. The Finance agent does not actually deal with funds: his task is to maintain a general balance sheet of all"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 321 participating rites, in all countries, with th e assistance of a Brother accountant sworn to absolute secrecy. The Propaganda agent furnis hes intelligence to the Supreme Chiefs in Rome and Charleston. An examination of how his functions are performed provides further fascinating insights into the convoluted decision-making procedures within the European Union structures, which are clearly, on the basi s of this solid evidence alone, of German Masonic origin. No-one outside the 'highest' geomasonic levels has ever identified or understood this connection. To explain this accurately, it is best to begin with the description of the sub-procedures by Bataille, replicated by Lady Queenborough: 'The business of the Propaganda agent is to furnish information to the Chiefs at Rome and Charleston.... He recei ves monthly, by secret messeng er from Berlin, the report of all measures formulated at the Sovereign Administrative Directory relating to means and methods judged useful in spreading the principles of the association [sic]' 'After a meeting he examines, coordinates and frames a report of the decisions upon which, three months later, the seven members of the Berlin Directory will vote. Of these seven members, thanks to the system of rotation explained above, there are always at least two who, having belonged to the Directory at the time of the submission of the Resolution under consideration, are able to furnish commentaries and explanations to the newcomers. Only Resolutions having obtained a favourable vote of five or seven voices can be registered by the Delegate Recorder, and these can be finally adopted only on the second following month, if they pass unanimously. In the event of one or more persons opposing a measure, the matter is referred to the Chief at Rome after which, fai ling its approval, it is settled arbitrarily by the Chief at Charleston, from whose decision there is no appeal' 101 . This implies that Charleston, not Rome, is the very head of the two-headed serpent, and such a deduction may be correct in this context. However, as has been reviewed, the United States has a founding remit, dating from its establishment, which is symbolically represented on the Great Seal of the United States, and which 'obliges' its Luciferian World Revolution implementers to carry out certain global tasks in accordance with European occult Masonic requirements. This framework precedes the esta blishment of the Supreme Administration by Mazzini and Pike, and cannot be negated by 'i mperatives' set up in accordance with their arrangements. The de facto subordination of the United States to the European occult geomasonic powers is, in the Author's opinion, deeply resented by certain informed US Masonic operatives, who may have thought that their country was truly independent; and understandably so. For their part, European s ources, and US sources of European origin, confirm that the occult geomasonic 'controllers' in Europe are wary of the genie they released from their Rosicrucian bottle - which they consider to have become too powerful, alt hough the United States is the military enfo rcement arm of their Revolution. GERMAN GEOMASONIC SIMILARITIES WITH EUROPEAN UNION PROCEDURES The origin of the 'rotating Presidency' of the European Union Collective, and of the even more bizarre 'changing memberships' of the European Council structures, is to be found in the arrangements originated for the Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory in Berlin. The constantly renewed membership of the Co mmittee of Seven operates by means of an ingeniously contrived system of rotation, with the representatives having a mandate for three months only. Each of the existing Rites (Scottish, Grand Orient, et al) send two of their members annually, drawn from any country except Germany which, alone of all the countries represented, is entitled to one member all the time. Indeed, of truly arresting significance is the similarity of these arrangements with"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"322 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer the convoluted decision-making processes which bedevil the corrupt operations of the European Union today. The Presidency of th e European Commission is rotated every six months (on the Berlin Masonic rotating principle). The European Council is a single body, but its membership changes from meeting to meeting in accordance with the subject category under discussion. Thus the European Council meeting in the format of the Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) cons ists of Economic and Finance Ministers and their entourages, together with the equi valent representatives from the European Commission. In 2006, there were 25 members of this political collective (a realisation of Pan-German strategy elaborated inter alia under Hitler in a collection of essays published in Berlin 1942 entitled 'Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft': see Chapter 8); and since each EU Minister brings several colleagues, a total of up to or more than 200 people now attends each ECOFIN meeting: there were over 100 before EU 'enlargement' in May 2004, so a doubling of the numbers must be approximately correct 102 . If, say, the European Council must discuss transportation issues, the attendees at the Council are Transport Ministers with all their official hangers-on and subordinates. Since Ministers and their colleagues come and go, subsequent meetings do not consist of the same people. Such arrangements were designed to serve the interests of an autocracy, namely that of the European Commission, which has Hitlerian powers of privilege to originate legislation. Reverting to the Berlin Directory, after five months (the quarterly mandate period plus the two months for final adoption of resolutions), it is obvious that none of the original members who proposed a given resolution would be present; and five months gives plenty of time for the manipulation of nominees pledged to vote according to the dictates of invisible masters. The rotati ng membership mechanism reveals (a) that the German Masons and their political action collea gues trust no-one; and (b) that the European Union Collective's structures follow the German Masonic model. In summary, it is clear to the Author that the convoluted decision-making mecha- nisms employed by the European Union, which ar e peculiar to that political collective, are indeed of German Masonic origin, given their close similarity to the equally convoluted decision-making arrangements, of a similar char acter, invented for use by the Berlin-based Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory. Another parallel is associated with the 'permanent' membership in the Berlin Directory of one German delegate. This is replicated in the European Union context by the fact that delegates from the European Commission are uniquely present at, and full privileged participants in, for instance, all sessions of all manifestations of the European Council. The Author is therefore fully confident of his conclusion that the European Union Collective and its structures are of German Masonic origin and inspired (and directed) by German geomasonry. It is further concluded fro m this analysis [see also Chapter 8] that German esoteric geomasonry is being and has always been used as cover for the implementation of secret ongoing German ge opolitical global hegem ony strategy. This deduction leads immediately to another revelation. As has been seen, the Great Seal of the United States contains the top-secret Rosicrucian remit of the United States, applicable from its foundation, which it is required to implement. The most senior of all the geomasonic control centres is the Executive Directory that is located in ROME. This was originally the seat of the gangster Giuseppe Mazzini, the Sovereign Chief of Po litical Action. Where has 'political action' 'progressed' to the furthest extent? Answer In Europe, with the development of the corrupt Tower of Babel called the European Union. And where was the first European Collective Treaty signed? Answer: In ROME."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 323 THE REST OF THE GEOMASONIC CONTROL STRUCTURE NEXUS We must bear in mind that the geomasonic Supreme Administration is in control of the whole of Masonry, according to extant intelligence in the public domain. Although it was consolidated a century after the American (Masonic) Revolution when the United States received its secret remit as symbolised on the Great Seal, since the (Nazi) BERLIN centre is in control, it controls the implementation of the United States' secret remit. The other geomasonic control centres, excluding any that may have been established since before the Second World War, are/were the following [see page 320]: 4. WASHINGTON: Grand Central Dire ctory for North America. 5. MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY: Grand Central Directory for South America. 6. NAPLES: Grand Central Directory for Europe. 7. CALCUTTA: Grand Central Directory for Asia . Note: Given the rapid evolution of the economic and political environments in Asia, this Directory may either have been relocated or else may have been augmented by one or more Sub-Directories. Given extensive CIA involvement in Thailand, an important drug-money laundering centre, and where the Thai Royal Family has been financially compromised, the Author speculates that a Grand Central Directory or Sub-Directory may have been established in Bangkok. Tokyo is another obvious possibility, as is Peking, where the changes that have taken pl ace since President Nixon travelled there in 1971 appear to conform closely to geomasonic preferences. 8. MAURITIUS: Central Sub-Directory for Africa. An additional peculiarity is that the Palladian Rite, directed and controlled dog- matically by Charleston, has, as indicated, no share in the functioning of the Sovereign Administrative Directory in Rome: (we are talking here specifically about the Palladian level, with no reference being necessary to the 'separate' Scottish Rite operations at Charleston, which co-exist of course in parallel with the Palladian dimension). This makes it quite clear that so far as the Palladian structures are concerned, all political action actually originates with the Sovereign Administrative Director in Rome, which almost certainly works to political agendas and instructions formulated by the Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory in BERLIN. (The elevation to the Papacy in 2005 of a German Cardinal is highly significant in this context, especially as the sorcerer-Jesuit ('Black') Pope, Count Hans Kolvenbach - who, in February 2006, announced his retirement in 2008 (this being the first time in this manifestation of 'The Order's 500+ year history, that a 'Black Pope' retires) is supposedly of German origin, but 'just happens' to have a Dutch name). That leaves Charleston's Palladian dimension concerned exclusive ly with the management of its Luciferian false religion. Its administrative functions are concerned exclusively with the Triangles, which have a separate budget. The issue of Palladian secrecy remains to be addressed. Since Palladism is 'a Higher' hidden geomasonic 'Ancient Mysteries' power, known only to certain 'perfect initiates', Palladism need not unveil itself and its membership even to the permanent but rotating and therefore constantly changing geomasonic committee of the Universal Sovereign Administrative Directory in Berlin, which is the highest expression of the administrative power of this occult internationalist body; and it doesn't, not least because given the frequent changes of the Berlin Directory's membership, any such revelations would soon reach a widening audience: indeed, one effect of the Berlin arrangements may be precisely to provide Charleston with a definitive incentive to maintain secrecy. Obviously, Charleston's membership is known to the Administrative Political Action"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"324 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer Centre bosses in Rome (inside or very closely associated with The Vatican). Additionally, there are several Masonic countries in which the Symbolic Grand Lodges recognise only the three Blue Degrees, with the highest Degree in such countries being Master Mason. These Lodges, like the others, are entitled to send two delegates from time to time to Berlin. However, ha ving suppressed the 'high' grades for their adepts, these national bodies are 'necessarily' ke pt in complete ignorance of the existence of Palladism. They may be aware of the S upremos in Charleston and Rome, as earnest and active 'Brothers' and fitt ing members of the 'Brotherhood of Man' (that is, of the geomasonic fraternity, not the re st of us, you understand); but they are not supposed to have any knowledge of the Palladian di mension whatsoever. The populist French Revolutionary slogan, 'The Brotherhood of Man', possessed, of course, a deceptive hidden meaning - namely that what was secre tly meant was 'the Brotherhood of Masons', with manifestly homosexual and paedophiliac overtones: hence Palladism. THE PLACE AND PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN GEOMASONIC SORCERY Like all these Luciferians, Albert Pike was in clined, on occasion, to boast openly about his prowess in engaging in practical applications of the knowledge gained from the Tree of Life (Death). Remember that Pike had been Satani sed during the American Civil War. Pike's address to the Supreme Council of Charleston on 20th October 1884, in which this chief sorcerer of the Lucife rians recounted the seance episode [see page 286] during which Sister Ingersoll floated above them in the nude, pr ovides confirmation that pagan rites over which he officiated involved the presence of women 103 . Of Albert Pike, it was also written by one of his contemporaries that 'his reputation as an occultist had overstepped the doors of the Lodges and inner shrines. Everyone knew from hearsay that he gave himself up to Luciferian practices' 104 . His nefarious example has b een progressively and reckle ssly amplified by his suc- cessor Luciferian imitators ever since. In founding the New and Refo rmed Palladian Rite, Albert Pike was not the inventor of Masonic occultism, the orig ins of which, as discussed, go back to at least Simon Magus. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Anderson, Desagul-iers, Weishaupt, Swedenborg, Lessing, Frederick II of Prussia, Mesmer (hence 'mesmerism'), Pernety, Cagliostro, Martinez Pasqualis and his disciple Saint-Martin, Francia (the dictator of Paraguay), Lord Palmerston, General Contreras, Giuseppe Mazzini and many other 'high' Freemasons practised occultism' and the Kabbalah 105 . When the Jewish Kabbalah-Satanist Eliphas Levi, the author of the demonic picture of Baphomet shown in Figure 50A on page 297, was prevailed upon by his friends, Chevaliers Fauvet and Caubet, who both bel onged to the Grand-Orient, to become a Mason, which he did on 14th March 1861, Levi was initiated in the Rosicrucian Lodge Rose Du Parfait Silence, of which Caubet was the Principal. According to a French Masonic author called Chacornac, cite d by Lady Queenborough, the ceremony was performed in the presence of 'many Brothers . Chacornac reported that 'in his reception speech, Eliphas Levi, to the great astonishment of his auditors, little inclined to paradoxes, made the following statement: \"I come to bring you lost traditions, the exact knowledge of your signs and emblems, and in consequence to show you the aim for the attainment of which your association has been constituted\". He then tried to demonstrate to his coreligionists [sic] that Masonic symbolism is borrowed from the Kabbalah. It was time wasted. No-one believed him' 106 . Manifestly, if not even members of a Lodge can understand the provenance of the symbols and actualite of the sorcery that surrounds"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 325 them, we need not be surprised that the 'profane' world chooses to turn a collective blind eye to the source of all contemporary evils, this intended system of occultic synar-chy, or rule by secret societies. Within this system, powerful families and Satanised intelligence cadres compete for influence and control, always at risk of squabbling like rats in a sack. The fact that these people cannot 'agree' indefinitely, and are always potentially and lethally at loggerheads with each other, is one of the reasons why sensible people, remote or separated from these evils, should never despair, even if they do not know Christ. For the end of these reprobates' turmoil is their own sole product: death. The 'Sister Ingersoll' description was Pike's own sanitised version of a decidedly unpleasant and dangerous occult event, complete with a touch of gross sick humour on the part of the evil spirits evoked. Since that report is in the public domain, and is the least offensive of many, it is included on pages 286-287, not for the sake of prurience, but so as to convey the reality of 'Works of Darkness' indul ged in by these 'high' (low) Luciferians who have eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Life (Death). Once hooked on such activ ities, the adept becomes more and more 'bound' and addicted, as happens with pornography. Malachi Martin told the Author that Satanic rituals, involving ritual murder, routinely took place 'within four blocks' of the apartment where he lived on East 63rd Street, New York City. The Author is not in a position to say whether the High Luciferians indulge, at the level just discussed, in such activities, since Malachi implied that after initiation through to the 'highesf levels of Scottish Rite Masonry, those progressing further (i.e., for instance, but by no means exclusively, engaged in Palladian Rite sex-activities), are of such an 'elevated' level, and are so comprehensively Satanised, that, as Luciferians and 'perfectly possessed', they are 'above' such behaviour. But some of the extreme practices known to occur at the Bohemian Grove among the very 'highest' of the Luciferian elite, and the excesses described by Mark Phillips and Cathy O'Brien in 'Trance Formation of America' [see Chapter 4 and Figure 42, page 225] are wholly consistent with these pagan 'Ancient Mysteries' practices. The present account does not describe occu ltic events, including procedures for occultically procuring the 'throwing of the force into the initiate's bodies and centers' 107 , and for evoking evil spirits, because it is enough to allude to such activities an d to affirm that descriptions of them, which have never been refuted, are available in the Masonic literature. Christians are enjoined not to 'go there', and mention of these unspeakable activities as has been necessary, has been minimised. Concerning women it has been noted that they participate in certain male rites, evidence for which has been cited from th e seance description by Albert Pike himself. Certain categories of 'sister Masons', probably su ch as Sister Ingersoll, are called 'Pink Serpents'. These are Luciferian missionaries who are not attached to Lodges, but operate as individuals under conditions of the greatest secrecy. According to the literature, records of the existence of 'Pink Serpents' including financial records, are scarce or non-existent. Many of these women are married, and in the secular context would be available for 'wife-swapping' activities. Lady Queenborough wrote somewhat charmingly of how these women operate: 'In certain cities where Masonic secrecy is less carefully guarded, a part of the Masonic premises is available for the use of the 'profane' public and for daily lectures or instructions by the Brother professors. In these rooms, every evening, accounting, stenography, foreign languages and other popular professional accomplishments are taught [so that] a great activity is thus created around Masonic headquarters, and the entrance of a woman more or less attracts no attention. The sister Masons, however, know to which room they must go and, once past the threshold of the building, it is not to the professorial lec-"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"326 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer ture room that they wend their way' 108 . Albert Pike's formal Masonic attitude to 'the use of women' was summarised in the course of instructions which he issued on 14th July 1898, as Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry, in which he made it abundantly clear that women exist for the perverse pleasure of men, that love and emotion doe s not enter into the equation, and that they are required to be available on demand: 'To the science of Faust (i.e. sorcery and demonic evocation - Ed.), the real Mason will join the impassibility of Job. He will eradicate superstition (by which Pike meant religious, specifically Christian, reservations against fo rnication - Ed.) from his heart and cultivate decision of character. He will accept pleasure onl y when he wishes it (making it plain that he meant not when the targeted woman wishes it - Ed.) and will wish it only when he should do so'. 'We earnestly recommend the creation of Lodges of Adoption. They are indispensable to the formation of Masons who are indeed Masters of themselves. The priest tries to subdue his flesh by enforced celibacy.... The real Mason, on the contrary, reaches perfection, that is to say, achieves self-mastery, by using his zeal in the Lodges of Adoption in subm itting to all natural ordeals. Commerce with women, belonging to all brethren, forms for him an armour against those passions which lead hearts astray. He alone can really possess voluptuousness. To be able, at will, to use or else to abstain, is a twofold power. Woman fetters thee by thy desires, we say to the adept: well, use women often and without passion: thou wilt thus become master of thy desires, and thou wilt enchain woman. From which it must perforce result that the real Ma son will succeed in easily solving the problem of the flesh. It is evidently not necessary that the man whom you are leading towards the high grades be immediately perfect and have understood our secret on his entrance into Masonry. That which we ask you is first to observe him with the greatest care during his apprenticeship and afterwards, when he enters the Lodge of Adoption as Companion, to use that as your criterion, your instrument of infallible control'. 109 The same instructions by Pike contained this further paragraph: 'The Lodge of Brothers which has failed to annex a Lodge of Sisters is incomplete and destined inevitably never to produce anything but Brethren, with whom politics are the chief concern, men who will be chiefly preoccupied with intrigue and rivalry, who will do bad work and whose politics will be incoherent' 110 . But further paragraphs outlined elaborately deceitful procedures whereby all open indications or formal admissions of the existence of female Lodges (of concubines) were to be suppressed, and subject to deliberate stratagems to mislead and cause co nfusion. In many instances where a male Lodge has a female Annexe, the existence of the female appendage is often completely ignored by most of the 'Brethren'. No mutual visiting is permitted at all among the female members of the 'lower' Masonic Degrees, and a 'sister' may only enter Lodges other than her own after she has attained the Fifth Degree. In addition to male General Inspectors on permanent missions, who are in direct comm unication with Charleston, there are women who provide functions as General Inspectresses - 'high-grade' women Masons belonging to some ordinary Lodge or other who, as Lady Queenborough explained, 'while not necessarily addicted to Palladism, serve the purpose of its leaders - their good offices being much appreciated [sic] when they furnis h useful information to headquarters. These women are privileged to enter the Lodges and Inner Shrines of Masonry only, but are not admitted to Palladian Triangles. As for men belonging to an adoptive Lodge where 'Brothers' and 'Sisters' 'work together'"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 327 [sic], they must have at least attained the 32nd Degree (Prince of the Royal Secret) or a corresponding grade in another rote...' 111 As for the precise nature of the Palladian super-rite from which these women are excluded, we have the following summary from Dr Bataille: 'This super-rite, which is Masonic Luciferian spiritism, must not be confused with the machinery of 'High Masonry'. Palladism is the cult of Satan in the inner shrines of a rite superimposed on all the rites. It is a cult, a religion; 'High Masonry' is a supreme administration involving an organisation much more highly developed than Palladism wh ose secret leaders, some of whom are not Luciferian, act in concert and accept a superior central authority in order that their work may be more effective' 112 . It seems as though Pike and selected colleagues lusted after more intoxicating sorcery and sex-oriented pagan 'fixes' than were available in the 'ordinary' Masonic Lodge and even at the 'highest' levels of routine Masonic debauchery. Hooked on their lust, they developed Palladism - a heightened and rarefied form of sexual depravity which could be shared at the 'highest' levels. THE EVIL OF MASONIC OATHS • INCOMPATIBILITY WITH GOOD ORDER The hegemony of Illuminised Freemasonry is a subversive and dangerous dimension of contemporary life, which is impeding good governance, with progressively ever more disastrous consequences for the integrity and survival of our civilisation. According to 'Henderson's Masonic World Guide' (for 1990), 16 years prior to the completion of this study, there were 5,000,000 Masons in 164 countries, with 3,000,000 Masons in the United States alone - the Rosicrucian Masonic foundation originally established as a geomasonic experiment by European forces, to which America still remains (whether its people like it or not) subordinate at the predominant Illuminati control and occult level. The same source identified 33,700 Masonic Lodges worldwid e, with the United States having by far the largest number of Lodges - a total of 15,300. Masonic penetration and influence of these proportions is wholly incompatible with good and reliable governance, given not least the nature of the oaths that Masonic candidates must swear. In varying Degrees, these require the Mason to cover up the crimes of fellow Masons, even at the cost of committing perjury. It is no surprise at all that the United States is perpetually mired, at all levels of governance, in scandals, and that its financial markets are dens of iniquity. Of course Masonry is also wholly incompat ible with True Christianity. 'No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon' 113 . It is also contrary to Christianity to swear at all. As Jesus explained: 'Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven; for it is God's throne; Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool; neither by Jeru salem, for it is the city of the Great King; Neither shalt thou swear by the head, becaus e thou canst not make one hair white nor black But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil' 114 . ALL Masonic oaths 'come of evil'. In no context is this more the case than in respect of the successive oaths that the Masonic candidate swears as he progresses 'upw ards' (= downwards) towards total control by Lucifer. When taking the oath of the Third Degree, the Scottish Rite Mason promises to conceal all crimes committed by a fellow Mason except t hose of treason and murder. By the Seventh Degree, the candidate must swear that he 'will assist a Companion Royal Arch Mason when I see him engaged in any difficulty, and will"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"328 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer espouse his cause so as to extri cate him from the same, whether he be right or wrong'. At the 13th Degree, the oath that the candidate must ta ke requires him to conceal, in perpetuity, all crimes, including those of murder and treason. Therefore, justice is constantly bei ng impeded, since unscrupulous Masons, of whom there are not a few, believe, with 'good ' reason, that their participation not only assists their material advancement in life, but also provides them with a significant and reliable means of protection whenever they 'sail too close to the wind' or take a risk by committing a crime, which serves their own selfish interest s. Masons pay lipservice to 'the Brotherhood of Man', but, like all their other lies, in realit y this (revolutionary) slog an refers, as we have seen, to the venally self-interested 'Brotherh ood' itself, rather than to Mankind generally. Moreover the protection afforded by Illuminised Masonic membership actually encourages venality, risk-taking and criminality. Further, the attraction of Masonry for ev il people is well doc umented. As Lady Queenborough put it: 'Unfortunately, many corrupt and vicious persons seek Masonic protection and it is to the interest of all such aspirants to power thus to encourage vice and corruption through blackmail, using their votari es in the sect to further their own private ends. This is the fundamenta l danger inherent in all secret societies, whatever their reputation, where power is the objective' 115 . All Masonry operates on the subversive b asis of sectarian assistance - with assistance for fellow Masons usurping the Christian teaching that 'thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself' 116 (love and help everyone to the extent that is practically possible). In other words, Freemasonry is a universally subversive synarchy , the persistence of which is fundamentally incompatible not just with True Christianity, but with good governance at both the national and international levels. It represents a dangerously permissive Fifth Column network which is equipped with its own intelligence system, which intelligence communities find extremely useful, on occasion. Most alarmingly of all, it is host to the complex parasitical Illuminati network of conspi ratorial secret societies. The virus of Luciferian and Satanic Masonr y is, as noted, absolutely chronic in the United States. The 15,300 US Lodges, as of 1990, included 220,000 Lodge members in the state of Ohio, where Satanism is so rampant that it is unsafe to enter certain towns at night, 206,000 in Pennsylvania, 206,000 in South Carolina - where Charleston is the Masonic capital, having been the location (on the 33rd parallel) from which Albert Pike achieved geomasonic 'primacy' - 188,000 in California, 146,000 in Illinois, 111,000 in Michigan, 96,000 in Tennessee, 90,000 in Geor gia, and 83,000 in Florida. In the extremely Masonic United Kingdom, there were said to be 8,000 Lodges with 600,000 members; in Canada, 1,600 Lodges with 180,000 members; in Australia, 580 Lodges with 30,000 members; in Italy, 560 Lodges with 24,000 members; in Germany, 400 Lodges with 21,000 members; in Cuba, run by that Jesuit Fidel Castro, 300 Lodges with 20,000 members; and in The Philippines, which US intelligence tried, in the 1980s, to convert into the 52nd US State, 200 Lodges with 15,000 members. And this list, of course, is woefully in complete. Masonic and esoteric symbols are displayed in the Kremlin and on many national flags. In France, and in all the Latin and Catholic countries, it is the Gr and-Orient 'line' of Freemasonry , which is at perennially at loggerheads - confusion and conflict bedevilling all those who follow Lucifer - with the Anglo-American 'Scottis h Rite' line of the 'Craft': and in Latin America, the Grand-Orient deliberately, ruthlessly and persistently seeks to exclude the 'gringo' Scottish Rite 'line' altogether. These conflicts are reflected in the US-promoted drug wars there."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 329 HOW FREEMASONIC ILLUMINATI PRINCI PLES DIVERGE FROM CHRISTIANITY The incompatibility of Masonry with Christianity is not merely self-evident from even a cursory glance at pagan Masonic mumbo-jumbo, let alone from any knowledge of the Degree structure and the system of progressi ve initiation, swearing and esoteric ritual leading to effective demonic possession, in many cases - but also from any systematic review of the false belief system of Masonic indoctrination. To cite just a few instances of how the two diverge, the false deity, called th e 'Great Architect of the Universe' who turns out upon progressive initiation to be Lucife r, can, Masons profess, be worshipped by anyone - Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus or Jews - without impediment or controversy: a statement of fact, since any one in the world can indeed worship Lucifer 117 . However, Jesus instructed his disciple Thomas, and all the disciples: 'I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me' . In his first Epistle to Timothy, Paul says: 'There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ' 119 . And in his First General Epistle, John's word on this central issue cuts to the truth: 'Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also' 120 . The entire atmosphere of the Lodge, in which your correspondent once briefly par- ticipated without initiation, is always grossly oppressive; and no wonder. A clue to the identity (which is later made much more manifest) of the Masonic deity, is provided in the 17th Degree of the Scottish Rite (The Knights of the East and West). After completion of the initiation, the candidate is given the secret password 'Jubulum', and the 'sacred word' 'Abaddon'. In Christ's Revelation, Chapter 9, verse 11, we are taught: 'They [demons, the workers of darkness from hell] had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Appollyon' (viz., Appollo, namely Satan in Greek) 121 . In 'lower' Degree Masonic ritual, the Lodge is concerned, to keep the 'dupes' occupied, with recovery of a lost word, 'presumed' to be the name of God. According to the gobbldegook invented by generations of these liars, it was supposedly lost through the murder of the architect, Hiram Abiff (not mentioned as such in Scripture, because this is an invention, a fable), during the construction of Solomon's Temple. The 'quest' is initially completed duri ng the ritual of the Ro yal Arch Degree ('arch' being Masonically symbolic of the female repro ductive anatomy). It is here that the 'secret' name of the 'deity' of Masonry is revealed, the fake name being JAHBULON. 'JAH' is the short-form for the Hebrew name of God, 'Yahweh' or Jehovah'. 'BUL' is a rendering of the god Ba'al, or Bel, plural Ba'alim, meaning mu ltiple gods/demons; and 'ON' is the term used in the Babylonian and Egyptian mysteries for the deity 'Osiris', the Egyptian god of the dead. This fact further 'illuminates' the deception, since the True God 'is not the God of the dead, but of the living' 122 . As for Osiris, in addition to being the Egyptian god of the dead, it was also the sun god, images of which are seen in the Lodge, normally in the form of a sun with a face and rays. In Thrace and Greece he was Di onysus, the god of pleasures, partying, wine and group sex. In Rome the same demon-deity was Liber, or Bacchus. The Lysians called him Bassareus and in Persia (as well as Rome), he was Mithras. For the Cretans, he was Zagreus, and 'became an underworld divinity who welcomed the souls of the dead to Hades and helped with their purification' 123 . In other locations, he went by all sorts of peculiar names, such as Deouis, Boy Jupiter, the Centaur, Orion, Saturn, Boy Plutus, Iswara, Winged One, Nimrod, Adoni (same as Adonay), Hermes, Prometheus,"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"330 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer Poseidon, Butes, Dardanus, Himeros, Imbors, Ia sius, Zeus, Iacchus, Hu, Thor, Bel, Serapis, Ormuzd, Apollo, Thammus, Tammuz, Atus, Hercules, Shiva, Moloch, and Ba'al. In other words, total confusion reigned as this entity was both the god of death and of sun-rays. In Jeremiah, Chapter 35, verse 35, for instance, the children of Israel were condemned for having adopted the post-natal 'contraception' ab omination of the local heathen, having 'built the high places of Ba'al' (these were tall columns on top of which stood an idol, often grouped in rows of four) 'which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom' (probably meaning 'the son of perdition, i.e. of Satan), 'to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech (Moloch, which is replicated at the Bohemian Grove, where bacchanalian-Satanic orgies are participated in by members of the US 'high elite'); which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin' 124 . It is on page 321 of 'Morals and Dogma' th at the Patriarch of US Freemasonry and geomasonic sorcery, Albert Pike, specifically e vokes Lucifer, as noted earlier, as follows: 'Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light? Doubt it not!' In his cited oppressive esoteric work 'Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy', the 33rd Degree Masoni c US author, Manly P. Hall, has a chapter providing precise instructions on how to summon up the Devil himself. Generally, in Masonry, the name of God is associated with pagan fertility gods such as Ba'al, and with all the sordid rites and evil abominations against wh ich the children of Israel were constantly warned by their Old Testament prophets. By contrast, True Christianity and Scripture affirm the absolute holiness, separateness and majesty of God's name . And numerous further bizarre characteristics of Freemasonry are diametrically opposite to Christianity (which of course Freemasonry exists precisely to destroy). For instance: • Freemasons are linked in solemn, spiritual bondage to one another, irrespective of individual members' creeds 126 . However Christianity forb ids Christians from being 'unequally yoked' with unbelievers 127 . Likewise, it is an absolute abomination for Christians (and for devout Jews of course) that the so-called 'truth' (which is false) is 'revealed' by the medium of successive secret initiations, whic h are absolute anathema. For the 'valuable' truths (lies) of Freemasonry that are bound under the most serious of secret oaths, are available only to a very few. Christianity specifically precludes such secrecy, as does, by very clear implication, the Old Testament. For instance, Jesus Christ tells his disciples [Matthew, Chapter 10, verses 25-27]: 'It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub [= the Devil, associated with and present with Ba'al or Be'el, Bel], how much more shall they call them of his household? Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness [= the darkness of the world - Ed.], that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops' 128 . • Prohibition on teaching and witnessing Christianity to a 'Brother' Mason: A (misguided) 'Christian' Mason in the Lodge is forbidden to witness Jesus Christ to his fellow Lodge members who are 'lost' and 'unsaved' 129 . By contrast, Jesus commands those who love Him to go and preach the Gospel to everyone, from the housetops: certainly, to be precluded by a Masonic prohibition from fulfilling this commandment of Jesus is a direct negation of His instruction and of His Will. This Masonic precept, too, is therefore an abomination and anathema to the True Christian - although given the dev-"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 331 ilish nature of Freemasonry, it would be a contradiction in terms for any True Christian to preach Jesus Christ from within the Lodge, and while he is a Mason 130 . • Freemasons are required to bow down before strange gods: The 'Higher Order' of the 'Mystic Shrine' also requires a blood oath of submission sworn to the Muslim deity Allah, which, as a demon recognised by the Jews, existed long before Mohammed. The oath includes the words: 'And may Allah, the god of Arab, Moslem and Mohammedan, the god of Our Fathers, support me to the entire fulfilment of the same, Amen, Amen, Amen'. The Bible prohibits the believer from bowing down to any other gods, as those who seek to syncretise religion want the rest of us to do. This is the primary commandment among the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt have no other gods but me' 131 . • Freemasons (or should they be called 'feemasons'?) waste a huge proportion of their lives and funds on their sterile and diversionary bl ack activities: They are required to be loyal and to give their time, 'emotions' and spiritual energies to Freemasonry, at the obvious expense of their families, which suffer accordingly and end up sterile and devoid of love. They are also required to contribute financially, mainly for the benefit of 'high' Masons unknown to them: over a lifetime, the amount of money wasted in such activities can be substantial. Furthermore, a Mason is constantly vulnerable to being asked for money and, in order not to displease his fellow 'Brethren' is always under undesirable moral pressure to pay up. This represents an incubus that many could do without, and as they waste more and more of their lives, it begins to dawn on some of them that they are being taken for a financial as well as for a 'spiritual' ride. By squandering loyalties, time, emotional and 'spiritual' resources, as well as their own finances, Masons divert their resources and finances from their families. They also squander time that could be more profitably spent 132 . • Freemasons are required to address their superiors with grovelling titles such as 'Worshipful Master', and to kneel before them 133 : Scripture commands us to call no man Master save Jesus, who uniquely allowed those who recognised who He was, to bow down before Him; and to worship none save God 134 . • Freemasonry asserts that its 'valuable' truths must be bound under grave secret oaths, and be available to only a select few: This is the or igin of the globalist Luciferian elite's erroneous notion that they alone are qualified and privileged to reorder the affairs of the rest of Mankind, an illusion which equates to gross power-idolatry. Scripture does not allow for or tolerate such secrecy, and ritual initiation is out of the question 135 . • Finally, the definitive prohibition against Christians being Freemasons is to be found in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 10, verse 21: 'Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partak ers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils' 136 . You cannot serve two masters, God and the Prince of this World. MASONIC LODGES DESCRIBED IN 594 BC There is, moreover, nothing new about Illuminati Masonic Lodges. In 594 BC, they were described by the prophet Ezekiel in graphic language, including allusions to animal abominations and that ancient travesty, worship of the sun (Osiris et al: see above): 'He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations'. 'And he brought me to the door of the court [of the Temple]; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. Then he said unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. And he said unto me, Go in, and behold"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"332 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer the wicked abominations that they do he re'. And he saw their double-mindedness: 'So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round a bout. And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel... with every man a censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up'. 'Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou se en what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? Tor they say, the Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth...'. 'And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the porch and the alta r, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east' 137 . All Christian churches face towards the East, which is to say, towards the rising sun. This is a pagan relic, since the Holy Spirit resides within us, not geographically. NOT FOR NOTHING IS MASONRY CALLED 'THE CRAFT' Masons refer to Freemasonry as th e 'Craft', short, as we have seen, for 'witchcraft'. Some, who know of, and point to, the existence and use of 'masonic Bibles' - such as the Masonic Bible which is routinely brought to US Presidential inaugura tions - assume in i gnorance that because the book is a 'Bible', Masonry is somehow sanctified. Such a superficial deduction is demolished by reports of former Satanists and witches who have been rescued from the abyss (by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, as true Christians believe, for they could never throw off such bondage on their own). Among a number of influential former sorcerers who have dedicated their lives ever since their rescue, to warning other blind dupes about the dangers of witchcraft, is the American former witch, William J. Schnoebelen. Concerning the deceptive use of the Bible (employing a specially adapted version) in certain Masonic rituals, he has this to say: 'Back in the 1 970s, when I first became a witc h, a very popular how-to book on magic was Raymond Buckland's 'Popular Candle-Burning' 138 . In this book were 'recipes' for magic spells for everything from healing to love spells, to protection spells. On one set of pages of the book would be a spell for healin g, complete with instructions on the burning and movement of certain coloured candles. Th e spell would be a full-blown witchcraft ritual, pagan to the core....'. 'On the following pages would be the same ritual, with the same candles [and] the same instructions. However, the text of the 'spell' would be drawn from the Psalms or [from] other Bible verses. These were provided for readers who were a little too squeamish to actually do a witchcraft incantation, but still wanted results'. 'Now the question becomes: Even though those rituals were full of Psalms, were they still witchcraft? Of course, the answer would have to be Yes. In similar manner, even though Bible phrases and characters abound in Masonic ritual 'work', the presence of those elements cannot somehow 'sanctify' what is ess entially a pagan ritual full of witchcraft overtones' 139 . Masonic rituals are in fact far, far worse than Wicca, which was in fact largely developed by the Freemasons Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley. 'For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft' 140 ; and Masonry is rebellion in spades. So Mr Schnoebelen has meticulously compared Masonic rituals with the witchcraft rituals with which he was familiar and a key participant for 17 years. His expert findings and warnings include the following assessments:"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 333 • Both witchcraft and Masonry are built upon a foundational system of three Degrees. In Freemasonry, these are the three 'Blue Degrees' , with multiple higher Degrees accessible to selected participants later. In Wicca, there are also three basic Degrees, with a few forms of Wicca offering some higher Degrees after the third Degree has been consummated. The Druids had, and retain, three Degrees. When Dr Rowan Williams, the reprobate prelate appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by The Queen on the advice of her Prime Minister, Tony Blair, he attended, shortly afterwards, a Druid ceremony prior to his Enthronement, and was reportedly raised to the 'highest' Druidic Degree. The Druids were associated with Satanic activities, including ritual murder. • Both categories of witchcraft are secret societies - in that in both, the membership lists are secret, and their secrets are withheld from the general public (although massive leakage has taken place in recent years, as these subversive elements have become increasingly uninhibited and brash). Both usually meet in secret - 'in the dark', as described by the prophet Ezekiel. • Both use ceremonial initiations, including sworn oaths, by means of which candidates pass from one Degree to another. This method of acquiring 'knowledge' is anathema to True Christians, to whom knowledge and understanding and wisdom is provided as a Free Gift of Grace through Scripture and the Holy Spirit. The Word of God was not divulged in secret. Nothing was done 'in a corner'. • Both witchcraft and Masonry undertake superstitious ceremonial purgings and purifications of their ritual space before any ritual 'work' is started. • In both, an immense amount of time is wa sted on these ster ile activities, which could be devoted to constructive use. Family life suffers and in Freemasonry, constant demands for money deplete personal and family financial resources. • There are also precise similarities, which include the following: O Candidates are required to strip off all secular clothing. O Candidates are required to be divested of all metal (indicative of the asserted magical management of electrical forces). O Candidates are hoodwinked (blindfolded), and ropes are tied round them cere- monially, signifying that they are to be BOUND by their oaths and by their adherence to the bondage that they have chosen. O Candidates are required to stand in the Northeast corner of the 'Temple' in the First Degree 141 ritual of Entered Apprentice. O In both witchcraft and Masonry, the candi date is challenged by having his naked chest pierced with a sharp instrument Witches use a sword, Masons the point of a compass, which also has other (sexual) significance. O In both witchcraft and Masonry, the candida te is required to swear solemn oaths of secrecy before being given custody of the group's secrets. O In both witchcraft and Masonry, the candida te is challenged using secret passwords, which are demonic in nature. O The candidate is led blindfolded, in both forms of witchcraft, in a circum- nambulation (walking round) of the Temple. Mr Schnoebelen further points out that the oaths required to be sworn by a witch are milder and less gruesome than the oaths which a Freemason must swear. For example, the text of a first grade oath according to the 'Witc hcraft Book of Shadows' reads as follows: 'I [Name], in the presence of the Mighty Ones , do of my own free will and accord, most solemnly swear that I will ever keep the s ecrets of the Arte [= 'Magical Arts'] and"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"334 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer never reveal the secrets of the Arte, except it be to a proper person, properly prepared and within a Magic Circle such as I am now in. All this I swear, by all my hopes of a future life, mindful that my measure has been taken; and may my weapons turn against me, if I should break this, my solemn oath' 142 . All of which sounds ridiculously mild, when compared even with the First Degree oath that was required (until 1986 in England) to be sworn by the Entered Apprentice Mason. This is too long to be cited in its entirety, but it ends like this: 'All this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a firm and steadfast resolution [so as] to keep and perform the same - binding myself under no less penalty than that of having my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by its roots, and my body buried in the r ough sands of the sea, at low water mark, where the tide ebbs and fl ows twice in twenty-four hours, should I ever knowingly violate this my Entered Apprentice obligation, so help me God and keep me steadfast in the due performance of the same' 143 . So we need not really have bothered to explain, even partially, as has been done, why Christianity is wholly incompatible with Masonry, given that the very first oath sworn by the misguided and ignorant candidate, for his very First Degree, is blasphemous beyond calm description. Not only are oaths forbidden for Christians, but here we have an oath which desecrates the human body - which Christ teac hes is the temple of the Holy Spirit - and murders it, while asking for God's help to enable the candidate to adhere to his bloody oath and thus to Satanic threats. How evil is that? IF IT'S AS BLACK AS THIS AT THE OUTSET, WHAT NEXT? But this is just the very 'mild', by Masonic standards, beginning. For this gruesome oath is just the first in a series of ever more horrible oaths which the deluded candidate is required to take as he ascends 'upwards' (= downwards), initiation after initiation. The oaths of the three Degrees of Wicca are lik e a Sunday School lesson, by comparison. Being a Mason, of whatever Degree, means that the duped person is condemned to Figure 53:The image inside the circle is the insignia of the Order of the llluminati, and is taken from the obverse of the Grea t Seal of the United States. It was imposed on the $1.0 bill in 1927 - since when Americans have been exchanging coupons displaying allegiance to the Evil One with every petty transaction. Although this is obvious, the failure of subsequent US Administrations to remove this abomination shows conclusively what Force they have all served. Removing this image would be a true counterrevolutionary gesture, and woul d have immense global consequences."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 335 going through life burdened with an ever-expanding incubus of demonic spiritual baggage weighing down upon him. And the system is merciless. By the time the deluded adept realises what his Masonic 'life' actually entails, it may be far too late, as he has been so spiritually drained and dumbed-down and infested, that he may lack the strength to rebel, not least because of the enormous burden of peer pressure which binds him. Another source of Masonic disillusionment, though, is that the Mason may come to realise that he is being exploited. For Freemasonry is like a pyramid scheme, or Ponzi game, consisting of a selfish hierarch y that lives and leeches off the lower levels. Those at the top of the scheme draw most of the revenues, thanks to the clueless efforts of countless thousands at the lower levels. The Mason must spend considerable sums of his private money to progress through the myriad Degrees, in addition to paying dues every year to every single body he has joined - which may amount to a si zeable amount, depending upon the level of participation. Mr Schnoebelen is not alone in having observed that there was a great deal of money 'sloshing around' in the upper Masonic ranks of which he had knowledge 144 . Other precise overt practical similarities be tween witchcraft and the 'Craft' have been authoritatively identified. They include: • Both have a ceremonial un-blindfolding of the candidate, following his oath, before lighted can dles - symbolising his 'illumination'. • Both witchcraft and Masonry convey to the new initia te the 'working tools' pertinent to the Degree. The use of each tool is explained and taught to the candidate. • In both witchcraft and Freemasonry, there are expl icit ceremonial correspondences to human reproduction, because both are sex-oriented, in conformity with their pagan orientation and origin. • In the higher Degrees, both witchcraft and the 'Cra ft' take the initiate thro ugh a ritual pagan death-and- rebirth (reincarnation) experience, in which the initiate acts the part of the hero (or heroine) of the Craft. • Both aberrations cause the candidate to endure, while blindfolded, being picked up, spun around, carried out, jostled, or struck from person to person. This filthy, violent abomination, is supposed to produce an 'altered state of consciousness'. [For an old depiction of this abomination, see Figure 41, page 221]. • Both witchcraft and Masonry are ope nly referred to as 'the Craft'. THE EVIL 'ALL-SEEING EYE' In 1985, Ralph Anderson, a US 32nd Degree Mason, stated in a presentation that 'The Masonic Movement... is the home of the [Ancient] Mysteries and the seat of initiation... Under the All-Seeing Eye the work can go forward. It is a far more occult organisation than can now be realised, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists' 1 . This Evil Eye of Masonry represents OSIRIS 2 , i.e. Satan/Sun/Lucifer. Albert Pike revealed that the geomas onic All-Seeing Eye is 'the emblem of OSIRIS, the creator' 3 . The symbolic symbol for Osiris and the sun is the point within a circle 4 , which is a phallic symbol 5 , the symbol of Generation, with which Masonry is con- cerned and is permanently obsessed. The occultist, Robert Hieronymus, says that 'the single eye, alone or in a triangle, is used extensively by Freemasons and other secret societies' 6 . ■ 1.

It was disconnected and out of context - i.e., a signal to 'the inter- ested' that The Times is llluminati-controlled. Figure 54: Albert Pike stated that The Blazing Star in our Lodges has been regarded as... the All-Seeing Eye ... representing [the] Guardian and Guide [= 'Spirit Guide'] of our souls. Also known as the 'evil eye', it is defined in 'The Complete Book of Witchcraft and Demonology' as 'the power of the glance to harm others'."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"336 C HAPTER 5: The House of Lucifer THE ADDICTIVE, PAGAN FO CUS ON LICENTIOUS SEX To complete this analysis, several other pertinent realities (among innumerable others, too numerous to elaborate here) are to be noted: • In both forms of the 'Craft' there is an unhealthy focus on loveless sex. Given the almost total hegemony of social power wielded by adepts of both forms of witchcraft, it is hardly surprising that modern Western values and life have been completely swamped by sexualisation - to the point at which our schoo ls now openly seek to sex-ualise their pupils, teaching them all about homose xuality and lesbianism at a tender age. In Masonry, the ceremonial Masonic apron is intended to cover the 'Holy of Holies' of Freemasonry, namely the male groin area - a reality which has been extensively documented by many analysts 145 . • The Masonic Two-Ball Cane tie-pin, available from suppliers to the 'Craft', which Masons proudly wear in the United States, often to church, reflects a play on the words Tubal-Cain (with gross pagan Biblical associations), and takes the form of two balls suspended to a cane, which has obviously crud e sexual connotations: see Figure 55, page 337. This is the very 'image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy 146 . The gods of all the pagan tribes and kings and nations around the Israelites were sexual idols; and at the deliberately- named Bohemian Grove, California, where so many of the high and mighty US geomasonic 'movers-and-shakers' go every summe r to indulge in pagan orgies, the night ceremony beneath that huge idol shaped like an owl, called Moloch, is perpetrated before a sexuality-related idol - Moloch having, as already noted, been the image to which the heathen neighbours of the Israelites, and at times the children of Israel themselves, sacrificed their own unwanted children. • The square and compasses used by Masons , while of course purporting to reflect their mediaeval cathedral-building tools, ar e representative of the generative organs; and, as also discussed earlier, the G that is set in the centre of these symbols stands not for God as naive initiates are left to believe (so that they can then ignorantly maintain that Christianity is compatible with Freemasonry), let alone even for Gnosticism, but in fact for Generativity or sexual potency. The blazing star at the centre of the Lodge is the familiar witch's pentagram, or Pythagorean pentalpha, widely used for Satanic symbolism purposes, and the basic symbol of the god of Satanism, Set. In Captain Morgan's classic work 'Illustrations of Masonry' , published in 1827, for which his Illuminati-Masonic 'Brethren' murdered him, many illustrations of a sun with rays are shown. The sun always has a spooky face. FREEMASONRY PLUGGED INTO THE GLOBAL WITCHCRAFT NETWORK To summarise, the 'authorities' of Freemasonry, notably Albert Pike and Manly P. Hall, both of whom were 33rd Degree Masons and black occultists, agreed that the underlying 'philosophies' of freemasonry are Kabbalism and Gnosticism 147 . Kabbalism is the Babylonian system of Jewish mysticism, ma gic, numerology and so forth, and is con- sidered to be the foundational element of mode rn witchcraft. Almost all the main witches and sorcerers known to have operated in the 20th century were Kabbalists. As for Gnosticism, it is the ancient, un-Christian heresy of Simon Magus which disseminates the base lie that 'one is saved by acquiring secret , unknown knowledge' (Greek: gnosis). All 'mystery religions', like witchcraft and Masonry, are gnostic in character. Both witches and Freemasons seek a form of salvation through 'illumination' or receiving 'the light', which is not the true light but the fa lse light emitted by the Angel"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 337 of Darkness, Lucifer. And both aberrations teach a form of sa lvation by works, not Grace. The Catholic Church, like modern Talmudic Juda ism, follows this heresy, as well. However by no amount of 'works' can we possibly attain justification in the sight of God. True Christians know that they will be saved by the freely-given gift of the Holy Spirit, not by 'works', which is indeed the most ancient of heresies 148 . The occult doctrine and lie of reincarnation is explicitly taught in wi tchcraft, and implicitly in the Lodge. We also have it on the authority of Mr Schnoebelen, a former witch and Mason -as well as from others who have managed to em erge from the same spiritual darkness - and from other written sources, that both witchcraft and Masonry deny the unique character and mission of Jesus Christ 149 . Both of course likewise deny the resurrection of Christ 150 . In each of these key respects, the Wicca share the 'theology' of Freemasonry. Mr Schnoebelen has reported that while he was still deluded by witchcraft and Masonry, he established that all the leaders of his witchcraft groups were Masons, while four of his male witch friends were also in the Lodge. This reflected the fact that Masonry is plugged into a global witchcraft network, a hierarchy of explicit evil which has gained the upper hand in the affairs of men. William Schnoebelen and his wife were members of a Co- Masonic Lodge, which are more openly occult and are controlled by the rite Le Droit Humaine (Human Rights Lodge), which admits both men and women as equals. Co- Masonry is affiliated with the occultic Theosophical Society, and in the United States is headquartered at Larkspur, CO. The progenitor (apart from Lucifer, of course) of the occult Theosophical Society was the notorious sorceress Annie Besant. The United Kingdom is a ho tbed of Masonry, whic h achieved unprecedented hegemony under the Blair Governments, given the large number of Scots holding high posts in the Government - Scotland being a Masonic state; but even so, British Masonry is a form of the 'Craft' that is less obviously 'in-your-face' than is the case in the United States, which is a Masonic foundation - explaining, as the Author has reiterated, the never-ending scandals and sordid controversies which so routinely bedevil (literally) Washington DC. Americans appear to accept this state of a ffairs with equanimity, without apparently realising the folly of having Satanic symbols plastered all over the Federal Government's structures. This is all the more extraordinary, given that so many Americans do believe in God. A belief in God necessitates recognition of the existence of Satan and his demons: clearly, the Workers of Darkness believe in them, as anyone who spends more than five minutes inside any of the chain book and music stores in America can immediately recognise. The proportion of floor space given over to the Works of Darkness has spread so extensively, that the 'religion' sections now consist largely of variants of witchcraft and the esoteric. And every day, when making rou- tine purchases, Americans exchange the insignia of The Order of the Illuminati, without often pausing to consider what this repetitive practice implies. They pass Figure 55: This image, display ed upon tie-pins obtainable from US Masonic suppliers, is called the Two-Ball Cane pin, a word- play on Tubal-Cain. From the US 'Masonic Quiz Book\": Q: Who was Tubal Cain? A: 'He is the Vulc an of the Pagans'. Vulcan was a sun deity associated with fire, thunderbolts and lightning, and at his festival, Vulcania, human sacrifices were offered.

Imagine: The 'All-Seeing Eye', the most prominent occult symbol in Masonry, an ancient image of Satan, sits perched on top of the uncompleted pyramid on the reverse of the $1.0 bill that is taken from the obverse of the Rosicrucian Great Seal of the United States. This constant, daily circulation and reminder of the 'All-Seeing Eye' and of the god of the United States represents nothing less than a ruthless, arrogant assertion by the United States' Rosicrucian founders - and latterly by the United States' Illuminati leadership - of an intention to impose The Order of the 'New World' upon humanity. According to the 33rd Degree Mason, Albert Mackey, the 'All-Seeing Eye' is 'a symbol of the omniscient and watchful providence of God' (by which he meant Lucifer). 'It is a very ancient symbol, and is supposed by some to be a relic of primitive sun-worship.... In most of the ancient languages of Asia, the eye and the sun are expressed in the same word. Among the Egyptians the eye was the symbol of their supreme god, Osiris, or the sun.. .' 151 . 'The Eye, or Uraeus, was to become the effective ruler of the world, and as such was to to be worn by the Pharaohs as a symbol of their majesty and descent from the sun god' 152 . Lucifer dominates the oppressi ve controlling Masonic hierarchy that reigns over the network of Masonic Lodges in the United States, and over the nation itself. The trapezoid (unfinished pyramid on both the $1 bill and on the Great Seal) is an especially significant symbol in overt Satanism 153 . And the 1776 in Roman numerals at the foot of the pyramid are not primarily, as is almost universally assumed, indicative of the year in which the Masonic foundation of the United States occurred, but the year in which the lapsed and aberrant Jewish Catholic-Jesuit occultist, Professor Adam Weishaupt, of Ingolstadt University, a keen student of the Jewish Kabbalistic philosopher Mendelsohn and the 'founder' of the 'Illuminati' in Bavaria, published his blueprint for the New World Order, which he had prepared under contract from the Rothschilds. If the dots that are formed by the stars of the 13 original states are joined, one obtains a Star of David. Freemasonry was penetrated at its highest levels during the 18th century by agents of the Illuminati. They consider their task to be to manipulate the 'mechanistic forces' of 'good and evil' (in which they do not believe) on the model of the later Hegelian dialectic (Thesis, Antithesis), which is a manifestation of th e Illuminati's primary double-minded modus operandi. In this model, from which they never deviate, they seek to impose the Synthesis. According to this model, every mechanistic forc e has a mechanistic counter-force: since these people have become 'gods' in their own eyes th rough initiation (being 'wise in their own eyes'), they seek to manipulate the 'seething energies of Lucifer' to generate the conflict out of which emerges a new situation, their preplanned Synthesis.The Illuminati make it their business always to be present at the Synthesis. It is extraordinary that anyo ne pays any attention at all to Freemasonry. For not only can its assertions and gobbldegook be torn apart and demolished intellectually by anyone with Scriptural knowledge and the patience to grapple with the mad minds of its dead prophets, but its chief dead Patriarch explicitly stated that its policy was always to deceive its own candidates and adepts - or, to borrow the cynical description of Blanchard, its 'dupes'. For it is to be repeated that - on page 819 of his tedious tome 'Morals and Dogma' - the sorcerer and necromancer Albe rt Pike explicitly revealed, fo r the whole world to take on board, that Masonry is a fraudulent system built exclusively"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 339 upon lies (which is quite obvious from even ten minutes' reading of his turgid and deadly text). As he explained, for the benefit of 'the interested': 'The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them' 154 . In closing, let us again reflect grimly upon the misfortune that United States is a Rosicrucian Freemasonic Revolutionary Foundation. Its secretive, aggressive European- implanted remit is described in symbolic terms upon the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. But Masonry - by the open publ ished admission of the acknowledged Patriarch and dead occult supremo of American world Freemasonry, Albert Pike - is a pack of black lies. Therefore, the United States is founded upon a pyramid of lies. Moreover, Freemasonry, the 'Craft', is witchcraft. The United States is accordingly founded upon lies and witchcraft, a fact that its shoppers acknowledge every day. No wonder all teaching of Chri stianity is prohibited in Amer ican public schools. It cannot be taught because the secret god of the United States is Lucifer, and its secret religion is Luciferian witchcraft taking the form of Rosicrucian occultic Kabbalistic Illuminati-penetrated Freemasonry, a primary objective of which is to 'destroy' Christianity. This is a vain and foolish objective, since Jesus Christ, Who is above all, explicitly promised that 'heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away' 155 . As has been acknowledged, of course, the United Kingdom has similarly grave problems with this subversive, arrogant and overpowerful, reprobate witchcraft sect. Both countries, sooner rather than later, will have to shed these evil incubi - or they will both be destroyed, not least because, as we have se en, good governance is incompatible with the self- serving and evil oaths that Freemasons have to swear, and with their corrosive consequences. Britain is in any case scheduled for obliteration by the Illuminati controllers of the New Underworld Order, the latest target date for the realisation of which is 2015. The fact that career progress in both countries is substantially dependent, in key sectors, upon Masonic participation and preferment, is indicative of a chronic state of morbidity. And the reality that similar problems exist in many other countries merely goes to show that we are only too right to fear 'that old serpen t, called the Devil, and Sata n, which deceiveth the whole world' 156 . No wonder that Jesus Christ warned us: 'Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell' 157 - namely, the Prince of Darkness, the Evil On e, the Devil, called Satan, and Lucifer. Paul warned about all this in 65 AD: so we have had the best part of two millennia to understand what he meant: 'Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron' 158 . ■ Chapter 5: THE HOUSE OF LUCIFER Notes and references: 1.

Hall not only confirms that the Egyptian death myst eries were the 'progenitors' of modern Freemasonry, a statement which is of course incomplete since the sorcery of Babylon a.k.a. the Jewish Kabbalah (= Babylon) were of equal importance, but also reveals that the inventers and elaborators of modern freemasonry, meaning primarily Albert Pike, had little information about the Egyptian death cult, and its Works of Darkness - from wh ich the Lord rescued the childre n of Israel, as related in Exodus. The story of Exodus is a living, hi storical parable for the truth that the Lord leads out of the darkness and 'the valley of the shadow of death' into the light of His glory. But the reprobate perversity and ignorance of initiated Ma sons leads them towards the darkness (Egypt) and its menu of abominations. 7.

Matthew, Chapter 23, verses 37-39. T he importance of this understandi ng is such that the entire passage has been given in t he main text. This book would be pointless if it amended the truth in order to spare certain readers' sensib ilities; and for this reason, the Author cannot have cognisance of cultural and organised religious preferences. The interpretation given here is correct, uncomfortable though it is for people of Jewish extraction and faith to acknowledge. The historical failure of the Jews to acknowledge this truth is a great human tragedy, but it is unfortunately their problem to resolve, not the Author's. Instead of recognising where the truth lay and lies, their Rabbis have spent two millennia fiddling around with the sorcery and sterility of the Kabbalah. 16.

Ephesians, Chapter 5, verses 11-14. In this passage, Paul not only commands that we 'have no fellowship with' the Works of Darkness, sorcerers and other deluded evildoers, but even says that it is shameful even to speak of these evil things that they do in secret. The Author by no means dissents from this, and ma kes only the exception that the meaning of the Word through Jesus Christ is revealed more clearly when we 'know our enemy', Satan. It is, obviously, for this reason that throughout much o f this book, wherever the Author's knowledge of Scripture helps to heighten awareness of the evils the world faces, the full scriptural reference and context is given. Paul was teaching that those who seek and know Christ do not waste time discussing the banal (and always unchanged) Works of Darkne ss, since the Works of Salvation are glorious and always worthy of contemplation and discourse. Since Lucifer works with in the bounds set by God, his works never vary: hence their dreary banality. 41. Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 8, ve rses 9-10.

This fo llows shortly after verses 20 and 21 in which those who call evil good and good evil, a s do Freemasons, are destined for perdition and destruction: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness fo r light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and pru dent in their own sight!' 61. Lady Queenborough, op. cit., pages 362-363. 62. The Author has noticed, as have colleagues, exactly the same phenomenon among a certain type of US intelligence operative. They agree with everything you say about, for instance , the United States being in the process of destruction due to the 'seething energies' of the reprobate intelligence services, wh ich they acknowledge are in turmoil (although it may suit some project managers for this to be quite widely perceived); and yet t hey continue to plot behind one' s back, to support and work f or this rotten system, and even to engage in threats of murder - both against their supposed friends and, especially, against fell ow intelligence operatives of whose activities they become insanely jealous or towards whom they suddenly harbour Satanic anger. This is all commonplace, and indicative, in the Author's experi ence, of the Satanisation of the intelligence community - which is hardly surprising, given its serial and recidivist criminality at home and abroad, and against the American people. 63.

But he differs from the brilliant Lady Queenborough in believing that, on the basis of his other writings, Mackey was cynical, like the rest of them. If he had genuinely wished to save fellow human beings from being crushed by this Leviathan, he would have needed to sever his relations with the Lodge, and put up with the material consequences of their petty vengeance: 'Come out of her [ i.e., the great whore], my people, that ye be not partakers of her si ns, and that ye receive not of her plagues' [Rev elation, Chapter 18, verse 4). The Author acknowledges that the insight that the great whore is the reprobate Jewish cabal which (in our contex t here) fronted the imposition of reprobate Freemasonry in the United States, is that of his friend, Des Griffin, of Oregon, and that his inspiration was undoubtedly of the Holy Spirit - bor n of his regular reading of Scripture. 65.

In Masonry, mem bers swear oaths on a Bible, in the name of God, that involve mutilation and murder of human beings [see for instance Malcolm C. Duncan, 'Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor', 1974, pages 224-225 and pages 250-251], But the Bible forbids taking God's name in vain and co mmitting murder: Exodus, Chapter 20, verse 7: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain', and 13: Thou shalt not kill'; and Jesus himself: Thou shalt do no murder' (Matthew, C hapter 19, verse 18). 115.

Matthew, Chapter 22, verses 31-32: To the Saducees, who did no t believe in the resurrection, Jesus said: 'But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the G od of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living'. Mark , Chapter 12, verses 26-27: 'An d as touching the dead, that they rise; have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err'. Luke, Chapter 20, verses 37-38:' Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Ab raham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all liv e unto him'. The fact that Jesus' distinction between the 'gods' of darkness (as in Egypt, where death was worshipped) and the God of life appears three times in the Go spels, is indicative of the importance of what Jesus had to say to all of us on this score. 123.

In verse 33, the Lord said through Jeremiah: 'And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching th em' (meaning I taught them BEFOR E I taught the Gentiles), 'yet they have not harkened to receive instruction'.

For he feared 'lest, by any means, as the se rpent beguiled Eve thr ough his subtle ty... your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ' 2 . Specifically, Paul knew that the new Christians in Corinth had been subjected to spiritual attack (which is the fate of all who receive Christ) and that the 'other Jesus', i.e. Satan's substitute, might suborn and entice many of them away from the Way, the Truth and Life which is the Word of God through Jesus (as only they who have accepted His promise through faith know for certain: there is no room for doubt at all). Paul called the teachers of spiritual lies 'false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ' 3 . Such deceivers represent that they are followers and teachers of the Word, using this false clothing to disguise their real allegiance to the Devil: indeed the clever ones can be indistinguishable, to the unwary (and to those unlearned in Scripture), from 'the real thing'. As Paul went on to explain, in one of his most glorious exposures of Satan's lies: 'And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousn ess; whose end shall be according to their works' 4 . Figure 63 on page 405 features the Rev Dr R obert H. Schuller, who handed over his Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, CA, to his son, Dr Robert Anthony Schuller, on 22nd January 2006. Schuller Sr. is s hown here performing a Masonic handshake with the head of the KGB Continuum, Mikhail Gorbachev (Orbach or Korbach) in the 1990s. In the United States, a secular state where the Illuminati have procured that 'religion' may not be taught in schools, founding one's own tax-exempt church is an enticing 'opportunity'. Such 'angel of light' ventures, of course, are nothing new. On 20th September 1870, the army of the King of Piedmont, who already called himself the King of Italy, entered Rome under the command of the Freemason, General Cadorna. On exactly the same day, Giuseppe Mazzini, the Illuminist Masoni c evil genius, founder of the modern Mafia (evolved from a tradition of scamming and banditry traceable back to at least the 11th century) and the brain behind idea of usi ng the Piedmontese Kingdom as the instrument for the unification of Italy, confirmed his agreement with his countervailing Illuminati associate, the US General Albert Pike, on the division of dogmatic (false doctrine) and political action (revolutionary agitation) powers between them. Specifically, Albert Pike obtained, as discu ssed in Chapter 5, the dogmatic author-"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"346 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light ity over the Scottish Rite 'line' of the 'craft', to mimic the Pope's powers of control over Catholic (as opposed to Christian) dogma - an d acquired the title of Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry, with his seat at the headquarters of the US Scottish Rite system and tradition, located for occult -esoteric reasons on the 33rd parallel in Charleston, South Carolina; while Mazzini acquired or retained the crucial executive authority, with the title of Sovereign Chief of Political Action, based in Rome. In the light of the Author's knowledge of colossal financial transfers of Illuminati funds 'redirected' in 1989-92 under George Bush Sr. into the hands of an Opus Dei agent for the Vatican, the Author understands that the Chief of Political Action is resident in the sovereign territory of the Vatican, the 'Open Friendly Society' division of the Illuminati. 666: THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST: IDENTIFIED AS ROME The Apostle John, writing in Revelation, Chapte r 13, verse 18, states: 'Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast' (the 'angel of light' referred to elsewhere in Revelation as the Beast-Lamb, which means the Evil One masquerading as Christ): for it is the number of a man: a nd his number is six hundred and three score and six' 5 . A pupil of the Apostle John, Polycarp, had in turn a pupil, Irenaeus (Irenius) (probably of Jewish extraction, as the name is close to the Jewish name Ira), a man of understanding, who knew from his teacher (and thus directly from John) that 666 represents the Greek word 'Lateinos', meaning the Latin Kingdom. This is because Kabbalistically- numerologically, Lateinos devolves to 666, as follows: L = 30; A = 1; T = 300; E = 5; I = 10; N = 50; O = 70; S = 200: which if you add the numbers up, comes to 666 6 . Rome is the seat of 'Lateinos', the Latin Kingdom [see box, page 347]. Therefore, 666 refers specifically to Rome 7 , as is evident from the fact that Mazzini, the Illuminati drug-dealer and founder of the modern Mafia, was accorded, by joint agr eement with the black magician-Illuminati- occultist and necromancer Albert Pike, the title (and therefore controlled the substance) of Chief of Political Action. Papal Rome, effectively the reconstituted seat of the Roman Emperor, made Latin its official language. As shown in Figures 8 and 9 on pages 26-27, the US Di amond Certificate worth $1.0 billion has serial numbers, which devolve to 666. This implies that the US Treasury issues these instruments on behalf of , in subservience or obeisan ce to, or in accordance with fundamental understandings w ith, the Vatican - a deduction that is supported by the curious facts that the Pope r eceives a briefing every Friday fro m the CIA Rezident, and that the US Envoy to the Holy See is always of exceptional importance within the highest levels of the US Federal structures. While President Bush Jr. was engaged in delivering his 2006 State of the Union Message, the former US Ambassador to the Vatican was absent, carrying the 'Black Bag' containi ng the President's nuclear codes. The so-called Eternal City is the seat not only of the so-called Holy See, the Vatican, but also of the Father General of the Society of Jesus, often referred to as the 'Black Pope' - the semi-secret organisation within the Catholic Church which acquired extraord inary powers from the outset of its existen ce, and which has understandably been a con stant source of anxiety to successive Popes, not least in its rece nt 'left-wing' years. The Jesuit 'Order', upon which their dialectical 'right-wing' competitors Opus Dei - currently in the ascendant in the Vatican, a nd in receipt of substantial US intelligence funds in 1992 - are modelled, was founded by Don Inigo de Loyola (Ignatius Loyola), a Spanish 'nobleman' and soldier of Jewish ex traction, on 5th April 1541, at the church of Saint Paul without the Walls, near Rome, under the sanction of Pope Paul III. The"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 347 RECONFIRMING THE IDENTITY OF... 666 'Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon In one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold' [1 Kings, Chapter 10, verse 14; 2 Chronicles, Chapter 9, verse 13]. These two references clearly establish a link between the number 666 and great riches. 'Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is: Six hundred threescore and six' [Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 18]. As indicated on page 346, Irenaeus, a pupil of Polycarp, who was in turn a pupil of John, understood the 666 to be derived from the Greek word L ATEINOS , in accordance with the kabbalistic-numerological arithmomancy method whereby letters of the alphabet are regarded as numerals. L ATEINOS means 'Latin Kingdom', and the Pope retained Latin as the Vatican's official language. In his book 'Roman Antichrist [1612], Andreas Helwig stat ed that the Pope's usurped title 'Vicar of Christ has the numerical value of 666. Written as Vicar of the Son of God' in Latin, or Vicarius Filii Dei, the letters with numerical value are: I = 1 (used six times), L = 50, V = 5, C = 100 and D = 500 - which, when counted,, total 666. The original name of Rome was Saturnia, meaning 'city of Saturn', which was the secret name revealed only to the initiates of the Chaldean mysteries which, in Chaldee, was spelled with four letters, STUR. In this language, S was 60, T was 400, U was 6, and R was 200 = 666. Furthermore, the name Romulus, from whom Rome was named, when converted to Hebrew Romiith = 666. L ATEINOS in Greek also means 'Latin man'. Unlike the Greeks and Hebrews, the Romans did not use all their alphabet for numbers: in fact they used only six letters, namely: D, C L, X, V, and I. All other Roman numbers were made up from combinations of these. The six numbers which comprised the Roman numerical system, when added up, come to 666: D = 500; C = 100; L = 50; X = 10; V = 5; and I = 1 (the numbers being those with which the six characters were universally iden tified). [M, which a long time after the Roman era came to be used as a Roman numeral, representing 1,000, was original ly written as CI, with another C turned backwards, to make CIC When squashed together this made a symbol which became M: E . W . Bullinger, 'Numbers in Scripture', page 284.]. The wealth of Solomon, which, as indicated, we are told twice amounted to 666 talents of gold 'in one year' which may mean 'annually', played an important role in l eading him astray, so that he abandoned his wisdom and wasted his substance with 700 wives and 300 concubines. The letters of the Greek word used in the New Testament for 'wealth', which was EUPHORIA , when translated into numerals according to the Babylonian system, totalled 666. Out of all the 2,000 Greek nouns used in the New Testament there is only one other word that has this kabbalistic numerical value - namely, the word PARADOSIS , which means 'tradition', as used in Matthew, Chapter 15, verses 2,3 and 6: Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?... But he answered and said unto them. Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?.... Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition' (referring to the elders' corruption of the commandment: 'Honour thy father and thy mother\"). So, we have two key-words from the New Testament which, when converted numerologically from the Greek, devolve to 666. Wealth and Tradition were and remain the two main sources of corruption in the Roman Church - Wealth corrupt ed honourable behaviour and honesty, while Tradition' has corrupted sound doctrine. Indeed, if one discusses these matters with a Catholic priest he will affirm that Scripture and Tradition are of equal importance and value - which gives rise to multiple fables. The Author was even informed by one Catholic priest at a conference in Hamilton, Ontario in 1999, that 'Mary' said this and that in the year 1603 - referring to some vision of Mary by a saint Such fables, of course, abound, and they provide ample scope for the variation of the Word of God, which was, the True Christian believes, with very good reason, conveyed exdusively through the written word of the prophets, disciples and Apostles. On a sinister note, Aleister Crowley, the British in telligence officer who became the 'Wickedest Man in the World' and the most notorious open Satanist of his day , referred to himself as The Great Wild Beast or TO MEGA QHIRON in Greek. Translated numerically, this phrase totals 666, as well. Given that the Babylonian kabbalistic sci ences are sorcery, with numerology reflecting arithmetical truths (as well as unsubstantiated assertions), there is nothing further to be gained from investigating 666 beyond what has been summarised here. Occultic kabbalistic numerology was, of course, prevalent among the Jews from the time of the Babylonian captivity (roughly 610 BC) onwards. In Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 18, John is informed of the corrupt beast who is a man; 'and his number is six hundr ed threescore and six'. Since the cited derivations using kabbalistic numerology devolve, as a matter of objective fact, to 666, the insight that 666 represents the Pope, a man who pronounced in 1870 that The Pope is Christ in office', despite the appallingly degraded and worldly history of the Papacy, is indisputably correct Pope Urban VIII, a 17th century Pope, who became involved in astrology and occult ritual, used a magical seal with three bees arranged in a triangle. The bee has long been the symbol of the harlot of Mystery Babylon. Popes wear costly, Babylonian crowns, and elaborate garments. Our simple Saviour had no such vanity. ■"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"348 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light Jesuits use pagan initiation, contrary to the purit y, simplicity and openness (affirmed by the absence of any hidden occult secrets or initiation procedures) of Jesus Christ. According to the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica': 'It (the Company of Jesuits) has six grades. These are novices, scholastics, temporal, coad jutors, professed of the three vows, and professed of the four vows [sic], the latter two grades being the only ones which confer a share in the government and eligibility for the offi ces of the society (a.k.a. 'The Order'). Its head, virtually a commander-in-chief, is know n as The General. He wields absolute power over the members who are pledged to blind obedience. The General claims his authority from the Pope'. Both Mazzini and Pike were of course Generals. The General has power, written into the Jesuits' statutes, that enables him, at will, to receive candidates secretly and also to co nceal their admission (secret membership). Another clause, the 'Encyclopaed ia Britannica' states, provides 'for the admission of candidates to the company (of the Jesuits) who are no t themselves members of it.... The General, who should by the statutes of the society resi de permanently at Rome, holds in his hands the right of appointment, not only to the office of Provincial over each of the great districts into which the houses are mapped, but to the offices of each house in particular, no shadow of electoral right or even sugg estion [of it] being recognised'. JESUITS ORGANISED 'LIKE AN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY' In line with other objective published anal yses, the comprehensive study published by 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' reveals the Jesuits to be organised along the lines of an intelligence community, as well as being an occult secret so ciety dealing in Black Magic, as will be revealed shortly. Indeed, it is largely in line with the Jesuitical precedent and in accordance with its blueprint, that modern intelligence communities - which are essentially occultic secret societies - are organised. As the British general literary source states: 'The superiors and rectors of all houses and Colle ges in Europe must report weekly to their Provincial on all matters concerning the me mbers of the society and all outsiders with whom they may have had dealings of any sort'. The Provincial, for his part, must report monthly to the General, giving him a summary of all details that have reached him. But, as a check on him, all Superiors of houses in his Jesuitical Province are to make separate reports directly to the General once every three m onths, and further to communicate with him, without delay, every time any matter of importance occurs, irrespective of any information which the Provincial may have forwarded'. This is of course a deliberately Satanic recipe for the universalisarion and institu- tionalisation of suspicion, distrust, secret hatreds, favouritism, nepotism, conniving, deceit and lying, fear, and innumerable othe r entrapments which could only have been invented by Satan himself. And these evil pr actices are perpetrated within an organisation named after Jesus himself: could there be any more precise illustration of what Paul meant when he proclaimed: 'And no marvel; for Satan hi mself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works' 8 . Did Jesus demand and impose such two-faced secrecy among his disciples? No: everything that Jesus did and said was of cour se done in the open: 'For this thing was not done in a corner' 9 . The whole point of Jesus Christ is that he leads us out of the darkness into the true light. His mission was To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith' 10 ."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Figure 56: The work of the Papal I nquisition in Holland: an illustration from 'Ridpath's History of the World' [Volume 5, page 297].

Certain Popes who are today proclaimed to have been 'great', lived and prospered during the Inquisition decades and centuries, during which period the Inquisition was responsible for an estimated 50,000,000 deaths - more than even the highest total ever attributed to Stalin's repression. Why did these Popes do nothing to stop this abomination? If by any chance you imagined that the Catholic Church has truly repented of it, you would be gravely mistaken. The Rev. Joseph Di Noia, the American-born Under-Secretary of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, so-called 'successor' to the Inquisition, i.e. a seamless continuatio n thereof, admitted in a four part UKTV History Channel series starting on 30th January 2006 that the 'Holy Terror' and its abominable methods of suppressing 'heresy' were 'explicable in the context of the times, when people believed passionately in Heaven and hell' (the implication being that the modern Catholic Church may believe in neither). Prior to his 'election' as Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was head of the 'Congregation'. The TV series drew on research obtained from Vatican files which were finally opened for scrutiny in 1998 (just like the KGB files, which were 'opened', only to be 'closed' a few years later). The programmes highlighted the Papal persecution that began in the 13th century, and only ended in the late 1800s. Interv iewed in 'The Secret Files of the Inquisiti on', Dr. Di Noia said that 'it was a mistake to torture people. However, torture was regarded as a perfectly justified, legitimate way of producing evidence and was therefore legally justified'. Such Black Luciferian sophistry deserves unqualified condemnation.

It was this secretive, manipulative and instrumental tradition, replicated within the Orthodox Church, from which Stalin (who, though of Jewish extraction, named Djugashvili, star ted life in a seminary, just as Karl Marx was weaned from Christianity following a Satanic initiation at his German university) learned the science and application of the devilish mechanisms of intimidation, pressure, harassment, coercion and control. 'Nor is this all. An elaborate system of espionage', the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' article continues,' forms part of the recognised order of every [Jesuit] house, and, in direct contrast to the ancient indictment and confession of fau lts in open conventual chamber [sic], every inmate of a house is liable to secret accusation to its Superior, while the Superior himself may be similarly reported to the Provincial or [to] The General'. 'Nor is the General [even] himself exempt from control on the part of the Society, lest by any possible error he be unfaithful to its interests. A Consultative Council is imposed on him by the General Congregation, consisting of six persons, whom he may neither select nor remove - namely, four assistants, each representing a nation, an admon-isher or adviser (resembling... a military commander) to warn him of any faults or mistakes, and his confessor. One of these must be in constant atte ndance on him; and while he is not at liberty to abdicate his office, nor to accept any dignity or office outside it without the assent of the society, he may yet be suspended or deposed by its authority'. 'Such is the extraordinary skill with which the relations of the Society to the Papacy were originally drafted by Loyola, and subse quently worked [on] by his successors, that it has always remained organically independent, and might very conceivably break with Rome without imperilling its own existence. The Gene ral has usually stood towards the Pope much as a powerful grand feudatory of the Middle Ages did towards a weak titular lord paramount... and the shrewd Roman populace have long shown their recogn ition of this fact by styling these two great personages severally [as] the 'White Pope' and the 'Black Pope'. In truth, the society has never, from the very first, obeyed the Pope, whenever its will and his happened to run counter to each other'. DEVISED AND ESCAPED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INQUISITION This classic survey of the history of the Jesuits elaborates that although they were responsible for the Inquisition - the Satanic, murderous, barbaric, brutal ecclesiastical control mechanism instituted first in Spain - they have always managed somehow to escape censure for it. The Inquisition was an abomination, involving inter alia the per- petration of the lie that, in addition to 'heret ics' - namely, those who saw right through the Pope's lies - those burned at the stake included 'witches'. Historians estimate that in the Middle Ages and Early Reformation Era, more th an 50,000,000 martyrs perished as the false church made 'war on the saints' [= Christians ]: Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 7. The women concerned were labelled 'witche s' to disguise the truth, namely that they, too, perceived the lies, deception and Satanic methodology of the Catholic Church and its so-called 'Vicar of Christ' - apostasy that this worldly geopolitical organisation could not tolerate, for fear that its power base would be u ndermined. And yet, 'the merited odium which has overtaken the Inquisition, usually officered by Domi nicans, has induced the Jesuits, whose own controversial methods had b een different, to disclaim"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 351 all connection with that tribunal, and to represent their society as free from complicity in its acts. But, in truth, it was Ignatius Loyola himself who procured its erection in Portugal in 1545-46, and Father Nithard, one of the very few Cardinals of the Society, was I nquisitor- General of that Kingdom [Portugal] in 1655' 11 . It will have been noticed that Loyola 'procured' the introduction of the Inquisition in 1545 - just four years after the Society's foundation. At the very least, the Jesuits were of a murderous disposition from the beginning. Remember that the Lord bracketed murderers with liars together. When reproving the Jesuits ' predecessors - the Pharisees, in the most logical and necessarily stern terms - Jesus said: 'Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it... He that is of God heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God' 12 . The Jesuits 'were' murderers (witness Loyola's procurement of the Inquisition in Portugal) and liars from the beginning - imposing their own secret pagan initiation cer- emonies, contrary to the openness, simplicity and straightforwardness of Jesus Christ, of whom they were and remain false apostles. Th ese people were, and remain, 'angels of light' - but of the darkness of Lucifer. The Author remembers a Jesuit named 'Father Levy' who was 'up' at Christ Church, Oxford, when he was an undergraduate there. This man had a reputation for alleged louche behaviour and heavy drinking - a state of affairs that caused the Author much puzzlement at the time. The Jesuits were recognisably driven, from the outset, by such 'seething energies of Lucifer' 13 . Their supreme talent has been to clothe their lupine aberrations in sheep's clothing - as false 'Angels of Lighf. SATANIC INITIATION RITES OF THE JESUIT SORCERERS Of Lucifer, Pike wrote, as will be recalled: 'L ucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendours intolerable binds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls [of which he, Pike, was one]? Doubt it not!' 14 . Doubt it not, either, that the initiation rites used by Jesuits are Luciferian, celebrating selected elements of the 'Ancient Mysteries', and consisting of components of the very same sorcery that Albert Pike and his occult Masonic colleagues consolidated and 'consecrated' in Illuminised Kabbalistic Masonry. For, far from being in any way related to Jesus Christ, Jesuit rule 'was' always Satanic in character - with its emphasis upon absolute obedience to The Order first, rather than to Christ, and its indulgence in secret Satanic ritual, as is confirmed by a manuscript in the Library at the Rue Richelieu, in Paris, entitled 'Histoire des congregations et sodalites jesuitiques depuis 1563 jusqu'au temps present' 1709) 15 . To provide the necessary irrefutable confirmation of the Satanic orientation of the Jesuits' initiation rites, as practiced in the early 18th century when the German Illuminati were releasing their 'seething energies', it is necessary to quote at length from this source: 'Initiation: Having in nearly all Roman Catholic countries succeeded in becoming the dictators of the young, they were able to mould the youthful mind according to their secret aims. If then, after a number of years, they detected in the pupil a blind and fanatic faith, conjoined with exalted pietism and indomitable courage, they proceeded to initiate him; in the opposite case, they excluded him. The proofs [i.e., testing of the boy -Ed.] lasted twenty-four hours, for which the candidate was prepared by long and severe"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"352 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light fasting, which, by prostrating his bodily strength, inflamed his fancy, and, just before the trial, a powerful drink was administered to him'. Th us, in addition to having murder in mind and being masters of deception (lies), the Je suits administered drugs to their young male initiates: so they were drug-pedd lers, and in all probability perverted paedophiles, as well. 'Then the mystic scene began - diabolical apparitions, evocation of the dead, rep- resentations of the flames of hell, skeletons, moving skulls, artificial thunder and lightning, in fact, the whole paraphernalia of the Ancient Mysteries'. [Here, the absolute hegemony of the 'Ancient Mysteries' - as is intended to become universal in our own era, if the Illuminati have their way - is plainly confirmed: Ed.]. 'If the neophyte, who was closely watched, showed fear or terror, he remained for ever in the inferior degree; but if he bore the proof [test] well, he was advanced to a higher grade'. 'At the initiation into the second degree (o f Scholastici) the same proofs, but on a grander scale, had to be undergone. The ca ndidate, again prepared for them by long fastings, was led with his eyes bandaged' [exactly as in the Lodge, and during Skull and Bones rituals - Ed.] 'into a large cavern, resounding with wild howlings and roarings, which he had to traverse, reciting at the sa me time prayers specially appointed for that occasion. At the end of the cave he had to cr awl through a narrow opening' [replicated by a similar 'narrow opening' in one of the orgiastic loci at the Bohemian Grove - Ed.], 'and while doing this, the bandage was taken from his eyes by an unseen hand, and he found himself in a square dungeon, whose floor was covered with a mortuary cloth, on which stood three lamps, shedding a feeble light on the skulls and skeletons ranged around. This was the Cave of Evocation, the Black Chamber, so famous in the annals of the Fathers. Here, giving himself up to prayer, the neophyte passed some time, during which the priests could, without his being aware of it, watch his every move and gesture. If his behaviour was satisfactory, all at once two brethren, representing archangels, presented themselves before him, without his being able to tell wh ence they had so suddenly started up... and, observing perfect silence, bound his forehead with a white band soaked with blood, and covered with hieroglyphics; they then hung a small crucifix round his neck, and a small satchel containing relics, or what did duty for them. Finally, they took off all his clothing, which they cast on a pyre in one corner of the cave, and marked his body with numerous crosses, drawn with blood'. At this point, the hierophant with his assistants entered and, having bound a red cloth round the middle of the candidate's bod y, the brethren, clothed in bloodstained garments, placed themselves besi de him, and drawing their da ggers, formed the steel arch over his head. A carpet then being spread on th e floor, all knelt down and prayed for about an hour' (which would have been a complete waste of time: the Lord does not hear those who walk in darkness, unless they repent, which these false 'Christian' priests emulating the Satanic sorcery rituals of pagan priests and yet naming themselves blasphemously after the Lord Jesus were not about to do - Ed.), 'after which the pyre was secretly set on fire; the further wall of the cave opened, the air resounded with strains, now gay, now lugubrious, and a long procession of spectres, phantoms, angels and demons filed past the neophyte like the 'supers' in a pantomime'. 'Whilst this farce was going on, the candidate took the following oath: - 'In the name of Christ crucified, I swear to burst th e bonds that yet unite me to father, mother, brothers, sisters, relations, friends 16 ; to the King, magistrates, an d any other authority to which I may ever have sworn fealty, obedience, gratitude or service.

I swear to yield myself up to my Superior, as if I were a corpse, deprived of life and will. Finally I swear to flee temptation, and to reveal all that I succeed in discovering , well aware that lightning is not more rapid and ready than the dagger to reach me wherever I may be'. No special knowledge of Scripture is necessary to recognise the extent to which the oath (let alone the Satanic sorcery surrounding it) which the Jesuit initiate was forced to succumb to, flies in the face of th e Word of Jesus Christ, and of 'the simplicity which is in Christ' and indeed of the crucial Commandment: 'Honour thy father and thy moth- Figure 574 [top]: The Inquisition's 'Iron Virg in', illustrated here, was a hollow instru ment made to the size and figure of a woman.

Such people were persecuted as 'heretics'. "},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"354 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light er' 16 . Everything that has been described was a nd is an abomination to the Lord: and the fact that these things 'were' done in the name of Jesus represented (represents) blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, for which the Lord st ated unequivocally that no forgiveness is available: 'And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man [Jesus], it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven' 17 . Furthermore, the Lord told those in authority who tried to catch him out in the Temple: 'Render therefore unto Caesar the th ings that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's' 18 meaning that we submit (not mindlessly, but as a practical matter. Otherwise society would disintegrate: and the Devil is the author of confusion, not of order) to those placed in authority over us, as we submit to the Word of God. We are given free will, which the Jesuit initiate is compelled to surrender, contrary to God's will for us - so that the Jesuit controller can exercise his ruthle ss, coercive and unlimited abusive power over his victim. As for the undertaking to flee temptation, this does not 'justify' the accompanying aberrations, not least because its purpose is to gratify the lusts of the controllers themselves. They feel more comf ortable when those under their control are forced to live in an unreal world, ostensibly devoid of temptation - whereas temptation is a daily hazard, part of the human condition, and a circumstance, which the Lord uses to help us to hear his call. The oath ends with the neophyte's pathetic acceptance of the fact that he will be under surveillance for the whol e of his life. He will have no privacy, will be able to form no normal human relationships - c ontrary to the natural order and the will of God for each of us - and will be reduced to the status of a mind-controlled tool of the sorcerers. THE FALSE 'EUPHORIA PERIOD' EXPERIENCED BY JESUIT NOVICES As will be explained, novices experience a 'eu phoria period' during which they exult in the fact that they are in the process of 'renouncing the world' and 'giving themselves to The Order'*. But as this early 'euphoria' gradually wears off, they become progressively more resigned and depressed - with many of th em acquiring peculiar habits, fetishes and preoccupations evidently arising from the wholly unnatural restrictions, lack of true and loving human relationships, and the environmen t in which they are required to live and have their pathetic being. In other words, the novice Jesuit's 'euphoric period' is false - akin to the tricks typically played by sorcerers, or magicians, who may, by evoking occult powers, be able to procure 'healing' or other phenomena. Any such 'healing' invariably turns out to be temporary, and when it 'wears off', the victim is left in a worse state than before - whereas true healing through prayer is always complete, permanent and perfect, in res ponse to the healer's true belief in Jesus' Will. One can scarcely imagine with what disillusionment a young male novice comes in due course to realis e that he has forfeited a normal life, and normal human sexuality, for this Satanic prison of body and spirit, er ected by false 'angels of light' calling themselves by the Name of Jesus. * As previously observed, a significant nu mber of these Luciferian occult entities ope nly refer to themselves as The Order'. The fact that this appellation is so common among them cannot be a coincidence. Not only do Jesuits talk about membership of The Order', but so do members of Opus Dei, and of the Satanic cult founded by a German and taken over by the British intelligence operative Aleister Crowley, before it was handed back to German custody - Ordo Templi Orientis. So why is this? It will be seen from Figure 62 on page 395 that the symbols of Opus Dei, which ought to be called Opus Luciferis, include (a) a circle with a (misaligned) cross within it, which mimics the esoteric symbol for 'the earth' and (b) a rose - which 'just happe ns' to be the symbol of the Rosicrucian sorcery- heresy (and of one of its offshoots, the British Labour Party). The Rosicrucians refer to their 'Order', according to the very rare document by Manly P. Hall cited in this book. Since, however disguised, all these organisations specialise in and practice the same sorcery and have the same globalist, worldly aims, it is perfectly clear that they represent manifestations of the same global organisation specialising in the Works of Darkness, and driven by the 'seething energies of Luc ifer'. One and all are components of 'The Order'."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 355 FROM THE JESUITS' BOOK OF SECRET INSTRUCTIONS One of the Jesuits' specialities has been, from the beginning, a policy of denying all critical reports about the organisation and its members, with the aim of discrediting such reports, and to take the reckless chance that they may be caught lying. The cynical underlying assumption here is that the veneration in which the Jesuits are mistakenly held, and their alleged closeness to the Pope, can always be relied upon to dampen the enthusiasm of any of their numerous enemies, for pressing ahead with exposures. However the Jesuits have been sensible enough not to deny the following information from a Book of Secret Instructions of th e Society of Jesus 19 : The Preface especially warns Jesuit Superiors not to allow it to fall into the hands of strangers, as it might give them a bad opinion of The Order. The Chapters are headed as follows: • How the Society is to proceed in founding a new establishment. • How the Brethren of the Society may acquire and preserve the friendship of Princes and other distinguished Personages. • How the Society is to conduct itself towards those who possess great influence in a state; and who, though they are not rich, may yet be of service to others. • Hints to Preachers and Confessors of Kings and great personages. • What conduct to observe towards the clergy and other religious orders. • How to win over rich widows. • How to hold widows fast and dispose of their property. • How to induce the children of widows to adopt a life of religious seclusion. • Of the increase of College revenues. • Of the private rigour of discipline to be observed by the Society. • How 'Ours' shall conduct themselves towards those that have been dismissed from the Society. • Whom to keep and make much of in the Society. • How to select young people for admission into the Society, and how to keep them there. • Of reserved cases, and reasons for dismissing from the Society. • How to behave towards nuns and devout women. • How to pretend contempt for riches. • General means for advancing the interest of the Society. This catalogue shows that, if any further proof were needed, this reprobate organ- isation, proclaiming the name of Jesus and using it as a cover for its sorcery and world- liness, is interested exclusively in itself (stealing the wealth of rich widows and appropriating their property), and in its intelligence activities (such as obtaining state secrets in confessionals from Monarchs and the highly-place d in Catholic countries). This is not the Society of Jesus, but yet another society of Satan, conforming to Christ's prophecy: Tor many shall come in my name, and shall deceive many' 20 ; or: 'For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect' 21 or: 'And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name saying, I am Christ... and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them' 22 . Given such explicit warnings from the Lord, how come that these reprobates have been able to deceive themselves and the world for so many centuries?"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"356 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light The authoritative source from which the chapter headings cited above are taken, summarises the extremely bad odour in which th e Jesuits have been justifiably held at various times in their history: 'The intermeddling of this society in the affairs political, ecclesiastical and civil, of many countries, is related in numerous works, and repeatedly produced the suppression and expulsion of The Order, though it constantly reappeared with new names. In 1716 the French army was infested with Jesuitical and anti-Jesuitical societies.... They were abolished by Papal Bull in 1773 at the demand of France, Spain, Portugal, Parma, Naples and Austria'. They are, however, 'still to be found everywhere, and they hold considerable property in Engla nd. A modern writer justly calls them the 'Black International''. THE 'MODERN' ILLUMINATI SPRINGING FROM A JESUIT SOURCE It was from the Jesuit College at Ingolstadt that the ev il sect originally known as the 'Illuminati of Bavaria' orig inated, in its modern and now relevant format (although the Illuminati tradition, and the pagan sect itself, is of much older occultic provenance, not addressed other than in passing here, since a separate volume is needed for that purpose). In its modern manifestation, the sect of the Uluminati was founded, significantly, on the Druidic Festival of Beltane, or Walpurgis Night, the second 'highest' day in the Druidic Witch's Calendar, and the Illuminati's second most 'sacred' day (when human sacrifice is required), namely 1st May 1776. Its founder (i n the modern format) was of course Adam Weishaupt, the Professor at the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, who had been educated (indoctrinated and infested) by th e Jesuits. The Illumi nati - which thus originated both in the 14th century and in their revamped manifest ation in Germany, where fascination with the occult was especially rife, having been set a light by emissaries from the occultic Court of the British King James II while in exile in Paris -spawned three classes of adepts, subdivided into degrees, in accordance with the Jesuit initiation system model and as replicated in Freemasonry [see Chapter 5], Using the Jesuit system of Satanic initiati on and degrees, this organisation was thus, from the beginning, as 'Masonic' as the Rosicrucians' Rose Croix (which adheres, like a malevolent limpet, to the ritual progression of the Scottish Rite ), the Templars and the other pseudo-ancient, emerging and proliferating Ma sonic Order manifestations of the tradition of Simon Magus and the 'Ancient Mysteries' wh ich all these 'secret' sex-oriented sorcery societies exist to promote and to recommend to humanity as 'normal behaviour'. Their great 'success' to date is everywhere apparent in modern Britain: for instance, a survey of 1,000 young girls aged 15-19 taken in 2005, found that 63% aspired to be glamour models, that 25% of their number hoped to become pornographic lap dancers, and that 'for many, the erotic lifestyle and look is not seedy but has become aspirational' - a finding indicative of the fast-approaching apparent triumph of the Illuminati's Luciferian agenda 23 . The British gutter (tabloid) press is de voted almost 100% to the degradation of women, pornography and sluttish filth, as th e Author discovered anew when he had to compile a mailing list in October 2005, of political corres pondents. As the avowed feminist journalist Flic Everett justifia bly observed in \"The Guardian'(before it downsized itself into insignificance in the third quarter of 2005), 'the once-concealed symbols and attitudes of hardcore porn are now flooding mainstream 'culture' (in Britain). 'While the Internet and mobile phone services were pivot al in offering easy access, sex-tr ade terminology is standard even on primetime TV' which is now so filthy a nd tawdry in the UK that if s unwatchable. Programmes called 'Pimp"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 357 my Ride', 'Wife Swap', 'Faking It', and 'pop' videos showing lusting rappers groping near- naked girls, are the norm. Shampoo advertisements 'address the product's orgasmic potential'. All this is voraciously consumed by boys, and girls, who have only just graduated from 'The Beano'' (a traditional children's comic). The feminist journalist con- cluded, assisted by her well-honed female intuition, that 'consequently boys are all heading to an adulthood of deeply confused, deeply mysogenist - attitudes to women'. The British tabloid-gutter press, which some 'broadsheet' papers are mimicking, assumes that fornication is the norm and celebrates it with th e sterile emptiness to be expected from such a powerful instrument of the Illuminati's assault on civilisation. For 'public? consumption purposes, Weishaupf s intention, given that he had split from the oppression of the Jesuit environment, was initially to constitute a Protestant organisation to fight Jesuitism (not a Christ-like intention, of course), using Jesuitical methods that he had learned from 'The Order', although in the event Weishaupt accepted instructions provided by Nathaniel Rothschild - with the objective of introducing more extensively than Freemasonry was succeeding in doing, the occult mysteries of the Kabbalah. He was assisted organisationally and doctrinally by a large number of prominent people with time on their hands, including Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733- 1811), behind whom stood Moses Mendelssohn; and behind Mendelssohn, stood the Kabbalistic Jewish Kahal - that is, the Jewish International World Government appa-rat 24 , which is and has been, since Caiaphas saw that Christ had triumphed, bent on the total extirpation of Christianity (True Christianity, that is). As the Illuminati expanded their influence through publishing and propaganda, their ambitions developed such a broad reach that they culminated in a conspiracy to sub- Figure 58: A Torture Chamber of the Papal Inquisition, by Pica rt [1673-1733]. A Papal Bull, 'Ad exstirpanda', issued by the cynically named Pope Innocent IV in 1252 ordered that heretics were to be 'crushed like ven- emous snakes', and formally approved the use of torture (as the US Government has done). According to t he 'Catholic Encyclopedia', this Bull remained 'henceforth a f undamental document of the Inquisition.... The civil authoritie s, therefore, were enjoined by the Popes, under pain of excommunication, to execute the legal sentences that condemned impenitent heretics to the stake. It is to be noted that excommunication itself was no trifle, for, if the person excommunicated did not free himself from the excommunication within a year, he was held by the legislation of that period to be a heretic, and incurred all the penalties that affected heresy' - which meant that non-compliance risk ed torture and being burned at the stake."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"358 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light vert Freemasonry and to focus it on the task of secretly agitating for th e world dominion of the Kabbalah (the Babylonian derivative of the 'Ancient Mysteries') by all means, including, to anticipate one of the German Illuminati's most demonic operatives, Lenin, 'working by other means'. Various agitators proliferated 'cheap and popular tracts ... and, as well as Nicolai, were in close communication with Weishaupt, carry[ing] on with a most reckless violence, and with weapons of a most shameless ribaldry, the warfare against Christianity' 25 . Since of course they confused the Roman Catholic Church with True Christianity, ribaldry and ridicule came naturally. CREATIONS OF THE EVIL ONE PR OGRAMMED TO FIGHT EACH OTHER Let us pause here to unravel the web of lies that Satan had by this stage so expertly weaved. Having, as specifically predicted in Reve lation, usurped the place of Christ and with a history of brutality and Borgia-style debauc hery masked by a false piety, the worldly Catholic Church and its papal 'Angels of Light' give birth to a law enforcement arm blasphemously named after Jesus himself, with the Pope all the while diverting the world's attention from Jesus Christ, as Satan intend ed, by drawing worship and adulation mainly towards himself and the forb idden 'Queen of Heaven' 26 (the female goddess Astarte who has become Mary, the earthly mother of Jesus, and of many other children, who is deceitfully declared to be 'immaculate ' in conformity with the pagan tradition). The new law enforcement arm organises, with in four years of its establishment, the scourge of the Inquisition, a plainly Satani c repression apparatus for which modern Catholics are supposed to have 'forgiven' their Church, or towards which they are induced to turn a blind eye. The Inquisition provides the mediaeval pr ecedent for modern 'population reduction' and genocide episodes - dispensing death on an industrial scale, and using false witness to persecute those with whom it has differen ces as 'heretics', and many genuine intuitive True Christians, as 'witches'. The law en forcement arm, being a black intelligence organisation, uses Satanic initia tion ceremonies, secrecy, oppre ssion, and the 'black arts' to further its own organisational in terests, and to enrich itself on the pretext of spreading the Word of God and supporting the Pope's suppo sed mission - but actually in order to increase, enhance and consolidate its own lustful power. Since the Devil is the author of confusion, none of these Satanic Illuminist ventures can succeed, and all are perennially and perpetually aff licted by scandal, riven by jealousies, rivalries and controversy, and bedevilled by internal tensions which threaten their continued existence. Tensions and resentments within the Jesuit manifestation of The Order generate hatreds such as that harboured by Weisha upt for his former Society: so he devi ses a long- term strategy for the destruction of the Jesuits an d of the Catholic Church itself. The error in which Weishaupt indulged, in common with all collaborators with the Illuminati sect and its manifestations today, was to confuse the corrupt and usurping Catholic Church, its Pope and its errant dogmas, and the Black Society of Je sus, with the real spiritual church of the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ, which has not hing to do with the worldly churches that have sprung up to exploit its legitimate hold on the attention of errant humanity. But from Satan's perspective, this was and remains the best of all possible hells: for, since ignorance about the Word of God prevails, what Satan has actually achieved through these deceptions is his own creations warring against each other - which is what happens, by definition, in all hellish environments. In late April 1981, Pope John Paul II c onvened a meeting at the Vatican, which was"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 359 concerned with the future of the Jesuit Order: whether it shou ld be reformed, or closed down (yet again). The Black Pope at that time was Father General Pedro Arrupe. An extremely detailed description of this mee ting, attended by six Cardinals (the same number of individuals required, under the Jesuits' own internal rules, to be present in the event of censure or other action against the Father General), was published in Malachi Martin's book 'The Jesuits: The Society of Jesu s and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church' (1987) 27 . As will be recalled from the foregoing, all Jesuits are required (on pain of being 'reached' by th at dagger) to report all details of whom they have been speaking with, meeting, and corresponding with, perpetually. THE AUTHOR'S FRIENDSHIP WITH THE LATE FR. MALACHI MARTIN Since Fr. Martin was a very senior Jesuit and Va tican intelligence operative with access to the Pope, it is likely that the source of this leak was none other than the late Malachi himself. Dr Martin, who was of partly Jewish extraction, personally informed the Author of one operation that he undertook for the Pope, which involved the infiltration of Jewish organisations in an attempt to establish the extent to which Freemasonry was being manipulated by militant modern Judaism, and to what extent these forces were as adamant as Caiaphas in their determination to destroy 'Christianity' - which, as previously indicated, is an impossible task since He promises us that 'the Gates of Hell shall not prevail' 28 - and accordingly what approach the Cath olic Church should adopt in the f ace of whatever overall threat Dr Martin could identify. Malachi further informed the Author that, following the completion of his papal remit, he was invited by the Pope to discu ss his future. As it had been necessary for Malachi to function as a layman while engaged in this intelligence operation, the Pope and his advisers were of the opinion that it would be necessary for Malachi to remove himself from the Roman scene altogether, lest his cove r was 'blown'. Given this requirement, the Pope had asked Malachi what he would like to do (basically, with the rest of his life). A brilliant linguist (he had master ed a large number of languages, including ancient Greek and Hebrew), Malachi surprisingly asked if he could be allowed to 'disappear' to North America, and write books. The Pope consented, and Malachi subsequently arrived in New York, almost down-and-out, where he undertook a number of jobs, including working as a stevedore. When he began his wr iting career, he started to reveal what he knew about attacks on the Catholic Chur ch, the Jesuits, and, in a remarkable book called 'Hostage to the Devil', his wisdom on the subj ect of exorcism. Since some have expressed interest in the Author's opinion as to whether Malachi was a True Christian or not, the Author can say with certainty that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ. However by the time that the Author was privileged to become one of Malachi's innumerable friends, in 1995, he had long si nce been granted comfortable, if frugal, accommodation by a great benefactor in an ap artment on East 63rd Street, New York City, where he wrote his amazing books in a small, cell-like room, which he shared with a small dog. On the first occasion that the Author me t him, during which we enjoyed three hours of conversation and Malachi will have formed a poor view of the Author 's grasp of matters such as are being discussed in this book the dog relieved himself and had to be attended to in a somewhat basic manner.

Apart from the information that he provided about certain past intelligence work, he never said anything at all about the Jesu its, as he felt that he had revealed all that he had needed to reveal, in his book on the Society 29 . But it was clear that, had he lived longer, he would have had to heed the urgent call of our Lord, echoing Isaiah, in Revelation [Chapter 18, verse 4]: 'Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues' 30 . THE PAPAL MEETING FAILS TO CUT THE JESUITS DOWN TO SIZE The scene for the meeting in the conference r oom on the third floor of the Palace of the Popes on Vatican Hill in April 1981 was set by Malachi in the following terms: \"The report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the Tiara and Keys. Outside the door, a secretary and two Swiss Guards in trad itional uniform were on duty to block all intruders. Seated at the conference table were the Pontiff of the Holy Roman Catholic Church and six of his most powerful Cardinal s, the movers and shakers of the Vatican, a cameo of its most formidable strength. And the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the Society of Jesus: whether, in other words, The Order headed by Father General Pedro Arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was, or be reorganised and reset according to the often-repeated wishes of three Po pes, or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of Pope John Paul II.. .' 31 . 'By this early spring of 1981... John Paul had already felt the effect firsthand of the enormous power that had accrued over centuri es to the Father General of the Society of Jesus. So great is that power in Rome and in the world at large, and so widely is it recognized, that whoever holds the office of Jesuit General also holds the unofficial title of \"the Black Pope\"...'. 'At the meeting that day, His Holiness sat in hi s white robes at the head of the table like a man whose husky and ebullient strength was scarcely caged, barely restrained from bursting forth. At age sixty-one, this first Polish Pope was a personality in powerful ascendancy, breathing enterprise, cloaked in a personal charisma, already a staple figure of the international news media. With the power of the Papacy behind him, most would have said, what prelate of the Church could stand up to him?' 'The meeting ranged over a wide number of issues, focusing especially upon the serial propagation of Marxism by clerics a ll over the world. The former Bishop of Cuernavaca, Mexico, Mendez Arceo, started hi s Sunday sermons with the clenched-fist salute of the Communist Internationale and shouted \"Soy Marxista\" (I am a Marxist!)... Cardinal Evaristo Arns of Sao Paulo, Brazil, took every opportunit y to scarify rigid cap- italism, and to laud the idea of a redistribu tion of wealth in order to relieve endemic poverty. And what about those French bishops who insisted on placing the birthday of Karl Marx on the official church liturgi cal calendar...? And what about the way the Canadian bishops made use of the Marxist analysis of the class struggle...?' One of the Cardinals, the most powerful, 'shared a d ouble persuasion with John Paul: that Latin America must be saved from Marxism, and that there was little to distinguish between the out-and-out Marxists in Latin America and th e bulk of Jesuit, Dominican, Franciscan and Maryknoll priests and nuns' in this respect. However earlier in 1981, the Polish Pope Jo hn Paul II had conducted an audience with Anatoly Adamshin, the Soviet negotiator - th e second such meeting - in the course of"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 361 which the Pope had given the Soviets a guarantee that no word or action, whether by the Pope or by the Polish hierarchy or Solidarity's leaders, would violate the Moscow-Vatican Pact of 1962. This was a reference to the outcome of tense negotiations between Eugene, Cardinal Tisserant, who had been despatched by P ope John XXIII to meet Metropolitan Nikodim, a senior KGB officer reporting dir ectly to the Kremlin and masquerading as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and who actually represented the Soviet Politburo headed by Nikita Khrushchev. Nikodim eventually obtained a guarantee from the Vatican that the then forthcoming Vatican Council would be issuing no condemnation of Soviet Communism or Marxism, and that the Holy See would make it a rule in future to abstain from all such official condemnation. So it was politely pointed out to Pope John Paul II at the meeting about the future of the Jesuits, who had gone doctrinally off the rails, that it would be inconsistent to take measures against the Jesuits for their Marxist orientation, while continuing to honour the successive undertakings given to the Soviets, to the effect that the Vatican would, contrary to earlier routine practice, utter no condemnatio ns whatsoever agains t murderous, atheistic Communism and Marxism-Leninism. But such arguments, and others, did not prevail. The case of the Jesuit Colegio Anchieta in Porto Alegre, Brazil, was brought up. There, Marxist textbooks were used in classrooms, Marxist principles were inculcated into the students, and the sacraments of Confession and Communion were derided as anachronistic. A report on this subject had been filed away deliberately, and forgotten. Another Jesuit, Father Caprile, had written in the official Jesuit magazine, 'Civilta Cattolica', published in Rome, that the standing requirement that Catholics could not belong to a Masonic Lodge was a dead letter (which was not yet the case, although it is now), so that Lodge membership was open to any Catholic (notwithstanding that Freemasonry and (True) Christianity are incompatible opposites). It was put before the meeting that such rebellious behaviour by Jesuits was quite intolerable. Many other examples of scandals concerning doctrine, Figure 59: The austere wartime Pontiff, Pius XII, proceeds in pomp and maje sty to his papal conveyance, to the salute of his chauffeur, while attendant Fascist troops present arms. The contrast between this arrogant behaviour and the gloriously meek simplicity of Jesus Ch rist is so extreme as to defy description."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"362 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light always with Jesuits at their centre, were mentioned. 'There were pages of documentation in the red damask folders before their Eminences about the Jesuits' teaching and preaching and acting consistently in ways that not merely departed from, but contradicted, the doctrinal teaching of the Church, as well as the explicit views of His Holiness on the most vital issues'. Th ere was no mention here of what Jesus taught. It seems extraordinary, given wh at has long been in the public domain concerning the Satanic initiation practices, for example, of the Society of Jesus, that a meeting discussing such subjects could have been he ld at all. One possible explana tion must be that the Jesuits' standing instruction that all critical reports on its activities must always be denied, had blinded successive Popes to the reality th at the Papacy harboured this reprobate intelligence organisation at its bosom. Another, more appropriate, conclusion would be that since the Vatican is itself a key hidden component of the Illuminati, the anti-Christian practices of the Jesuits, though embarrassing, however watered down to conform with modern preferences, were nothing out of the ordi nary. The standing intelligence rule - 'Admit nothing; deny everything; make counterallegations' - had enabled the Society to elide over open knowledge of its nefarious practices. Besides, the Vatican considered its intelligence services to be indispensable, given their global reach and the Jesuits' unrivalled ability to penetrate at the very highest levels, not least thanks to the Society's confessional services. Even so, the meeting did not go well fro m the perspective of Father General Arrupe, the Black Pope. As Malachi concluded 32 : 'Very soon, Fath er General Pedro Arrupe would have a blow-by-blow account of the meeting. He would know all that had been said.... It would only be a matter of time before the Holy Father would move in on the Society of Jesus, to reform it from top to bottom, or to terminate its existence, possibly forever. In either case, this time Arrupe, who clung doggedly to his persuasion that he and his Jesuits knew better than the Vicar he served what was good for God's Church, would have to go'. ATTEMPTED AND ACTUAL PAPAL MURDERS IN THE VATICAN As previously mentioned (twice), the Vatican Rezident of the Masonically-impregnated Central Intelligence Agency is in the habit of briefing the Pope every Friday. The CIA operative concerned would not have been doing his job properly if he had not procured detailed information about the discussion at that meeting and its uncertain and worrying outcome. On 13th May 1981, within three weeks of the private papal conference, John Paul II was struck by two bullets, not from a Kalashnikov rifle, but from the American- manufactured Browning semiaut omatic pistol of the paid hitman Mehmet Ali Agca. Malachi reported: 'By mistake [sic], as it was later explained, the Pontiff was rushed to the Roman hospital of Gemelli rather than to the special hospital unit organized solely for papal use. He was given blood from the public blood bank; th e private supply kept in readiness was never used. In rapid succession, Pope John Paul underwent two major operations and suffered the consequences of the transfusion of impure blood; he contracted a severe case of hepatitis.... It would, as it turned out, take the Holy Father the best part of six months to get back to anything like a full schedule 33 . In 1978, Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani on 17th October 1912, had been 'unexpectedly' elected Pope after an abnormally brief Conclave. Although his feet were so swollen that he could not wear the shoe s bought for him for the Conclave and his"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 363 state of health was less than satisfactory, he had made no enemies, controversial or radical statements, and was thought of as just a smiling, gentle pastor. When, to his own horror and disbelief, Luciani was elected, he made several quick decisions - being the first modern Pope to speak in singular form, rather than using the royal 'we', and the first to refuse the sedia gestatoria, until the Vatican machine convinced him that he needed to be carried about so that the faithful could see him - the real reason being that officials felt that his awkward, flat-footed walk was 'unregal' and ungainly, and that they were very embarrassed by it. He also suggested strongly to his aides that he was unfit to be Pope, and 'controversially' refused to undergo the traditional Papal Coronation and to wear the Papal Tiara 34 . He had intended to prepare an encyclical to confirm the lines of the Second Vatican Council, and to enforce the Catholic Church's discipline in the lives of priests and the faithful. Formally, Pope John Paul I defended Pope Paul VI's contracep tion encyclical on sexual mores, Humanae Vitae, which restated the Church's opposition to artificial birth control, and which (although it may appear cynical to say so) suited the Church since it facilitated the maximisation of the numbers of the faithful, thus buttressing the global power of the Catholic Church. But this Pope raised concerns inside the Vatican after meeting United Nations representatives who had visited the Vatican in order to discuss the issue of overpopulation in the Third World. This Author believes that it is in part because the Catholic Church has refused to make any concessions on this issue (as Pope John Paul I may in fact have secretly intended) that many voices are heard today calling for population reduction, and that certain Illuminist cadres of international intelligence are content with, and openly discuss, prospects for population culls. Some observers were disturbed when they noted the pleasure taken by George Bush II in October 2005 at a meeting of global pharmaceutical companies, at which the prospects for a global bird 'flu pandemic were openly discussed. One US operative, speaking to a contact of the Author's who is concerned that the black (Nazi) mentality of some of these people is bent on facilitating (and IS facilit ating) population reduction by diverse means, including the use of weather-modification and earthquake-triggering technology, replied, when told that consideration of such policies was an abomination: 'It depends to which part of the population you belong'. One biographer of Pope John Paul I, John Cornwell, author of 'A Thief in the Night', has said that Vatican officials 'treated him wi th condescension'. A senior cleric, discussing Luciani, was reported to have said: 'They have elected Peter Sellers'. His sermons mentioned Pinnochio, in contrast to the learne d discourses of Pius XII or Paul VI. Luciani's own doubts about his suitability for the Papacy, was manifest in his repeated question to people he met: 'Why did they pick me?' He predicted that his reign would be short and that 'the foreigner' - meaning the Pole, Karol, Cardinal Wojtila, who was sitting opposite him when he made this prediction - would succeed him. The Pope's Private Secretary, John Magee, revealed that His New Holiness allowed a large loose-leaf Top Secret document to fall from his roof garden and to blow over the Vatican's rooftops, as a result of which the Vatican's fire service was called to retrieve the hundreds of pages that were blowing about. In a particularly uncalled-for revelation, Magee spoke of finding the poor Pope crying, wh ereupon he advised him to go to bed - later finding him in a foetal position saying the Rosary. If only he had been praying to Jesus Christ instead of to the Virgin Mary (who can do nothing, of course), the poor man might have received the spiritual and bodily su pport he so desperately needed."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"364 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light Many visitors spoke of his isolation and loneliness after his unexpected election. Thirty-three days after his election, Pope John Paul I was reported dead of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). As one account of this assassination tactfully puts it, 'a certain degree of uncertainty accompanies this diagnosis, because no autopsy was ev- idently performed'. In fact what had occurred was that a nun who served him had brought the Pope a glass of champagne laced with poison (probably digitalis). The source of this information is a close relative of the Offici al Representative of the Belgian Government posted at the Vatican 35 at the time. Poisoning is of course the method of assassination most favoured by the Illuminati, as poor Mozart found out in his last hours. During the darkest days of the Borgia Popes in the Renaissance years, papal officials or courtiers hired apothecaries working in the cellars of the Apostolic Palace to prepare cantarella, a poison based on arsenic and putrefied viscera, destined for their rivals 36 . As is invariably the case after Satan ha s provoked murder, the aftermath of this papal liquidation was one of to tal confusion. The first versio n was that a papal secretary had discovered that the Pope had died, whereas acco rding to a later version, a nun, who had found the Pope somewhere in the Papal Househ old, had brought him some coffee, only to find him dead. The Vatican claimed that he ha d been reading Thomas a Kempis' 'Imitation of Christ', even though Luciani's co py of that devotional work had been left at his home in Venice. The Vatican lied about th e time of the Pope's death, an d conflicting accounts of his health appeared - including one suggestion that his ill-health had reflected his heavy smoking even though the man never smoked. Like the murdered Princess Diana, Pope Jo hn Paul I was embalmed one day after his death. The Vatican claimed that a papal post- mortem was prohibited under Vatican law, even though a post-mortem was conducted on th e remains of Pope Pius VIII in 1830. It has been claimed that close fr iends of the late Pope John Paul I were ordered away from the corpse while some form of inspection, even a post-mortem, took place. The fact that no results were subsequently released suggests that the Pope's death was not due to natural causes 'but either due to murder or to an overdose that the Vatican might not wish to make public' 37 . CONFUSION OVER MURDER EXACERBATED BY CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS As this Author has revealed above how th e murder was committed, it may seem super- fluous reviewing here the fi ndings of two lay investigat ors - David Yallop and John Cornwell - who, in their re spective books 'In God's Name' 38 and 'A Thief in the Night' 39 , have advanced competitive explanations of that P ope's death, with Cornwell taking pleasure in debunking all of Yallop's fi ndings. That author was correct in suggesting that Luciano was always in 'potential danger' because he was an innocent who will have become aware, to his undoubted horror, of the stinking corruptio n surrounding the still murky intelligence- linked and organised crime-ridde n scandals associated with Istituto per le Opere Religiose (IOR, Institute of Religious Works, a.k.a. the Vatican Bank). That vortex of corruption involved Freemasonry, Masonic in telligence forces (as has been the case with all such scandals over the past several decades), the Mafia, the dubious banker Mchele Sindona ('St Peter's Banker'), Pope Paul VI, the head of th e Vatican Bank, Bishop Paul Marcinkus, Licio Gelli, the P-2 Masonic Lodge, Franklin National Bank, and Roberto Calvi ('God's Banker') of Banco Am brosiano (found hanging beneath the Masonically significant Blackfriars Bridge in London in June 1982, having been convicted by an Italian court in 1981 for illegal currency transactions). Sindona's financial"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 365 empire was collapsing by 1974 and the related financial empire run by his protege Calvi, by 1978 - both groups having been scammed; and in 1980, Sindona was convicted in the United States on 65 counts of fraud. He was extrad ited to Italy in 1984, where two years later he was poisoned in his cell while serving a life sentence for murder. Roberto Calvi, whose nickname 'God's Banker' had been given to him by the Italian press because of his close association with the Vatican, had fled fr om Italy after Banco Ambrosiano had gone bankrupt under his chairmanship, with debts variously estimated at between $700 million and $1.5 billion. A substantial proportion of these funds had been siphoned off via the Vatican Bank, a.k.a. the 'Institute of Religious Works'. Calvi had belonged to Licio Gelli's secret P-2 Masonic Lodge, an Illuminati operation. The British police, heavily infiltrated with Freemasonry, treated Calvi's death as a suicide, despite evidence to the contrary. Following Calvi's exhumation in 1992, the murder was confirmed. In 1997, Rome prosecutors implicated a member of the Sicilian Mafia, one Pippo Calo, in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, a 'businessman'. Also alleged by prosecutors to have been involved in Calvi's murder were Ernesto Diotallevi, supposedly a leader of the most dangerous Roman Mafia syndicate known as the 'Banda della Magliana', and a 'Mafia banker', Francesco Di Carlo. P-2 (Propaganda Due) appears to have been the Italian Fascist Continuum, a nominally Masonic Lodge which ran Italy from behind the scenes for decades, while the front men traded Cabinet posts back and forth innumerable times to effect 'changes of govern-ment'. With the assistance of the US-born gangster-priest Paul Marcinkus, of Jewish extraction, P-2 ran the Vatican Bank. During the years in question, Istituto per le Opere Religiose was caught red-handed laundering counterfeit paper for the Gambino crime family. The long-term Grand Master of P-2, or cappo di tutti capos, was the veteran neofas-cist and former Mussolini 'Black Shirt' operative and liaison between the Italian Fascist Government and Hitler's Third Reich, leading Gestapo informant and confidante of Hermann Goering Lucio Gelli, who attended the inaugurations of President Gerald Ford (a.ka. Leslie Lynch King Jr., allegedly a top US pornography boss) and of President James Earl Carter, Jr., while also calling himself a friend of George Bush Sr.. P-2's membership 'consisted' of over 1,000 prominent political, financial and Italian Government figures, and the organisation 'had' close links with the Italian intelligence community (including its 'Black' secret intelligence organisation), senior military staff, and key Italian media figures. Four Cabinet ministers and 48 MPs were secret P-2 members, so that P-2 resembled a Fascist 'state within the state', while Gelli was referred to as the 'Puppet Master'. Yallop's book exposed many of the inaccurate statements issued by the Vatican in the days following Pope John Paul I's death, prompting demands from some clerics for an inquiry into the death (which would have been a waste of time, given the Vatican's tradition of holding its multiple dark secrets indefinitely). 'In God's Name' was then partially 'discredited' by John Cornwell, who proposed a 'benign' series of explanations to account for the many discrepancies in the official versions of the death. After decades of controversy, there were calls in the autumn of 2005 for Pope John Paul I to be canonised, and for a fresh investigation into his death to be initiated. The contrarian (and contrary) findings of John Cornwell are extremely sordid, but entirely consistent in principle with the long, dark history of papal murders and deaths. The main problem with the relative whitewashing job that he performed was that the information provided by this Author, and publ ished here for the first time, disproves his 'benign' hypothesis. On top of this, Cornwell seems to have been careless and may have"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"366 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light bent facts to suit his hypotheses. Cornwell did report, however, that John Magee, who became the Irish Catholic Bishop of Cloyne, s poke on the night of the Pope's death to the nuns in the Papal Household about the possibility of the Pope dying that night. This of course is as consistent with Magee's possible knowledge of a murder plot, as with any benign medical explanation. Mr Cornwell also stretche d credulity - and hazarded the integrity of his entire analysis - by claiming that guilt drove the doctors to want to make his death look sudden, so that no blame would fall on them. According to Cornwell, John Paul I died at around 9.30 pm or perhaps 10.00 pm at his desk and was found on the floo r in a foetal position by two priest secretaries. These then (according to Cornwell) moved the body into th e bed and placed it in what is an unusual position for a person who has died suddenly, sitting up, eyeglasses in place, and papers in hand, with no indication whatsoever that he had experienced a fatal attack. Cornwell then stretched credulity to breaking point by suggesting that the two secretaries had done this to try to cover up the fact that the Pope had suffer ed two episodes of acute chest pain consistent with diagnosis of an imminent pulmonary embolism, as well as a severe coughing fit, and that in both instances, the Pope had brushed the doctors off. Cornwell's analysis then goes completely mad, stating that one of the papal secretaries had found the Pope's back and feet still warm when he lifted him. This was incons istent with the stated fact that the body was found at around 5.30 am (according to Cornwell), by which time rigor mortis would have set in. As a consequence, the Pope's knee or his back , or both, had to be broken, as the body was forced into a position suitable for a lying-in -state in an open coffin (a disgusting death- oriented practice still adhered to by the Vatican). Interestingly, Pope John Paul I's tomb under St Peter's Basilica is not one that enables voye urs to look through glass panels at the body (as is the case with many other dead Popes) - anot her manifestation of the Vatican's death cult. This death cult is further displayed for the whole world to see by the use of the crucifix - or cross on which the dying or dead body of Jesus Christ is affixed. This forbidden graven image depicts Christ in agony, whereas the truth of the gospel necessitates affirmation of the reality that Jesus died for our sins once and for all - not every day, as the graven image of his agonised body portrayed by Catholic crucifixes implies 40 . MURDERS AMONG THE VATICAN'S SWISS GUARD On 4th May 1988, the Commander of the Swis s Papal Guard, only just appointed by Pope John Paul II, Colonel Al ois Estermann, and his Vene zuelan wife Gladys Meza Romero, as well as a Lance Corporal, Cedric To rnay, were discovered shot dead in the Estermanns' apartment in the Vatican complex. Five months earlier, Enrico Sini Luzi, a 'Gentleman of His Holiness' - an Order whose me mbers, wearing white gloves and black tails, greet dignitaries visiting the Pope - was battered to death with an antique chandelier in his home, clad only in his underwe ar, apparently during a homosexual tryst with a Romanian prostitute 41 . That murder, like that in November 1849 of Count Pellegrino Rossi, a lay Prime Minister serving the Papal States, took place outside the Vatican. The murder of the Estermanns, which took place in side the Vatican, appears to have been connected with resentment on the part of Tornay at his lack of promotion, but may have had homosexual overtones; a book by the British-French journalist, John Follain 42 , while containing exhaustive research, did not comprehensively unravel the mystery - hardly surprising, in view of the almost (but not quite) impenetrable omerta routine with which the Vatican buries its darkest secrets."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 367 The Vatican's 'line' subsequently was that the Lance Corporal had shot the couple and had then committed suicide in 'a fit of madness' brought on by frustration with the unit's discipline, a conclusion that was reaffirmed after a nine-month official inquiry. However Follain's book shows that the official Vatican report was a travesty, a tissue of suppositions, contradictions and omissions. The author concluded that the Vatican, the oldest and most secretive autocracy in the world, staged an elaborate plot to obstruct justice, and to hide scandals to which it dared not conf ess. Estermann turned out to have links to the overpowerful Opus Dei, which has a passion for the ungodly practice of self-flagellation [see below], and Cedric Tornay may have feared that Estermann had been instructed to impose Opus Dei rules on the entire Swiss Guard. This would have been appropriate, indicating Opus Dei's intent to achieve total hegemony in the 'Holy See' - given the now consummated ascendancy of Opus Dei in the Vatican, with the consecration of the German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinge r as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. John Follain's general conclusions were damning. 'Even today, the conspiracy of silence and the refusal to admit any responsibility prevails', he wrote in the epilogue to his book 'City of Secrets: The Startling Truth Behind the Vatican Murders' [2003] 42 . 'Although the three victims have long been buried, and the Vatican's enquiry - a shoddy affair that lied by omission - remains closed, the files of that enquiry are still locked away' 43 . When the Vatican decided to go onto the offensive, it chose to revile the Swiss Lance Corporal 'from every pulpit with a virulence worthy of the Holy Inquisition, and dismissed [him] as a drugged paranoiac. The Vatican even violated subjudice rules to leak key evidence... when that suited its purpose' 44 . Shortly after the deaths, an East German newspaper, Berliner Kurier, reported that Estermann had been a STASI operative with the codename 'Werder' who, equipped with a Vatican passport, could pass through border controls unchecked. The East German Communist newspaper revealed that during his first four years with the Swiss Guard, Estermann had sent at least seven files to his STASI (i.e., DVD) controllers, depositing them with the Rome-Innsbruck night train. It is no purpose of this Chapter to unravel these particular Vatican murders, not least since, unlike the case of Pope John Paul I, this Author does not possess special intelligence concerning that scandal. Intere stingly, though, John Follain did have a few words of interest to say about Pope John Paul I's sudden death: 'The official version said that the Pope's body was discovered by his secretary, the Irish priest John Magee.... In fact, as the Vatican confessed later, it was a nun, Sister Vincenza, who had discovered the body when, as every morning, she had entered the bedroom to bring the Pope coffee. The Secretary of State at that time, Cardinal Jean Villot, had lied because it was feared that Catholics would be shocked to learn that a woman was the first person to see their Pope in the morning. The Vatican had also lied in reporting that the Pope had the 'Imitation of Christ', a devotional work, in his hands when he died - a crude attempt to create an aura of sanctity around his passing' 45 . 'Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when 'ere we practice to deceive'. The murder of that Pope by a nun who brought him poisoned champagne has been successfully disguised (until the publication of this book) by the familiar technique of floating alternative interpretations which it was intended should remain hanging in mid-air and at loggerheads for eternity. But we can at least note, in passing, how the denial of normal human heterosexual relations to Catholic priests, which is a pagan control mechanism inherited from the heathen traditions of Rome and Greece, 'forces' the perpetuation of lies and deception. The new Pope Benedict XVI is assisted by a fellow German, Georg Ganswein,"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"368 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light from Riedern am Wald, Bavaria. Born on 30t h July 1956, Ganswein was ordained in 1984, and obtained his doctorate of canon law from Munich University. He arrived at the Vatican in 1995 and stepped almost at once onto the fast track there. In 1996, he was asked by the then cardinal Ratzinger to join his staff, and he became a Professor of Canon Law at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, an institution affiliated to Opus Dei. A Vatican source has said of this Opus Dei operative: 'He unde rstands complicated issues within about 10 seconds and can give a clear and immediate answer'. Daniel Deckers, author of a biography of the leading German 'liberal' Cardinal, Karl Lehmann, says: 'I think he's very dangerous. He's part of a small but very powe rful group within the Catholic Church. He will use his power to push Ratzinger in a certain direction'. Deckers is reported to have elaborated: 'He is very eloquent and can be very charming. But he came right up to us and said: \"Oh, you don't like us\". He referred to himself and Ratzinger as 'us', as if the tw o of them were an institution'. Deckers' reference to the Pope being liable to be pushed 'in a certain direction' has special resonance with this Author because Ratzinger, who also comes from Bavaria where he was born in 1927, was brought up in a deeply Catholic environment within which, according to a special source, the Nazi ethos w as considered to be an abomination. This may be hard for some to reconcile with what is known about the central importance of Bavaria as the seat of the 'modern' Illumi nati - until we recall that the primary characteristic of all branches and members of Illuminati Orders is double-mindedness, which is of course the twin of confusion. THE DOUBLE-MINDEDNESS CHARACT ERISTIC OF ALL ILLUMINATI For public consumption, when Benedict XVI 'beat ified' a German priest in the autumn of 2005, he pronounced, with considerable emotion, that the German priest had been 'an intrepid combater against the National Socialist neo-pagan ideology'. Specifically the new Pope declared: 'This morning in St Peter's there has taken place the beatification of Klement August von Galen, Bishop of Munste r, an intrepid opponent of the Nazi regime. In the name of God, he denounced the neo-pagan ideology of National Socialism'. This was reported to the Author on 11th October 2005, a week or so foll owing the beatification, by a Catholic priest who telephoned from Rome with this information. The possibility therefore existed as this book was being finalised that the new Pope's Bavarian origins could not be assumed to imply that he shared the 'world-view' of the heirs of the Third Reich who have all but achieved hegemony within certain intelligence and power structures in both the United States, and secretly behind official facades in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, but that he may be susceptible to such an orientatio n through pressure from Opus Dei. The worst case scenario, though, would be that the Pope's pronouncement concerning the beatified German priest did not reflect Benedict XVI's true perspectives, and that he is in fact, in common with Illuminati tradition, double-minde d. Unfortunately, given the millennia of lies and deception surrounding the Papacy, one can never be certain what any Pope really believes, let alone whom he really worships. This consideration is all the more relevant given that Cardinal Ratzinger served as head of the Congr egation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a.k.a. the 'Holy Office of the Inquisition'. Furtherm ore, Ratzinger joined the Hitler Youth, as young Germans at that time were 'required' to do, although the Vatican's 'line' is that he was not an enthusiastic member 46 . That is a pointless statement, since all Hitler Youth were compelled to be, 'enthusiastic'. Sensitivity over the new Pope's true 'political' orientation is associated, of course,"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 369 with the shadow that hangs ov er the reputation of the auster e wartime Pope, Pius XII, and the Vatican's failure to condemn the Nazis' attempted genocide of Jews, gypsies and others (the Holocaust) [see Figure 59 on page 361]. Likewise, in 1940, after Nazi stormtroopers had entered France, the future Pope John XXIII (s econd manifestation), Mgr. Angelo Ronca lli, did not warn about the dark shadow of the German jackboot enveloping Europe, and neither did he fret over the fate of the French Jews who had just fallen into Hitler's trap. What that Pope, known interestingly in Rome as 'Il Papa buono', implying that other Popes had been less than buono, wrote in one document was that German society was made up of 'alert, strong' men who fully deserved their victory over 'worn-out French democracy'. According to Pier Giorgio Zunino, a lecturer in contemporary history at the University of Turin, the Angelo Roncalli of the 1940s was 'fully at home with the majority Catholic culture: aligned with Fascism, opposed to Soviet Communism, but also suspicious of Western democracy' 47 . THE DOUBLE SATANIC BLACK MASS IN THE VATICAN AND SOUTH CAROLINA In 1996, the late Fr. Malachi Martin informed this Author about what he was about to publish in his new book 'Windswept House'. We were enjoying breakfast at his favourite small Irish Hotel near his adopted home on East 63rd Street, New York. Over fried eggs and sausages, Malachi informed the Author that the Prologue to the new book would describe, in precise detail, 'the Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer' that was effected in the course of a dual Black Mass 'celebrated within the Roman Catholic Citadel on 29th June 1963. The abomination took place in the Chapel of St Paul. The Devil's routine is to turn everything inside out and upside down, so that lies replace the truth, good is called evil and evil good 48 . \"The sacred must be profaned. The profane must be adored. Guilt must be accepted as innocence. Pain must give joy, Grace, repentance, pardon must all be drowned in an orgy of opposites. And it must all be done without any mistakes. The sequence of events, the meaning of the words, the significance of the [Black Satanic ritual] actions must all comprise the perfect enactment of sacrilege, the ultimate ritual of treachery' 49 . Props familiar to sorcerers were assembled into 'the experienced hands of the Prince [of this World's] trusted Guardian in Rome. 'A past master of the elaborate ceremonialism of the Roman Catholic Church, so much more was this granite-faced and add- tongued Prelate a Magister of the Prince's Ceremonial of Darkness and Fire' 50 . He was unnamed. Figure 60: Pope Benedict XVI, elected in 2005, with his Opus Dei aide, Georg Ganswein. Both are from Bavaria, the home of the German llluminati. Der Spiegel reported on 17th October 2005 that the Pope 'channels' his predecessor - i.e., he communes with a lying familiar spirit."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"370 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light Malachi Martin further explained that 'the immediate aim of every [Black Satanic] Ceremonial, he knew, is to venerate \"the abomination of desolation\"' 51 . But now the purpose of the imminent Black Mass was to secu re the ascent of the Prince of Darkness in the Citadel of the Roman Catholic Church, so as 'to supplant the Citadel's Keeper, to take full possession of the Keys entrusted to the Keeper' [the [Pope] by Jesus. If Malachi had lived beyond July 1999, and had maintained contact with the Author, no doubt we could have discussed the errors contained within th is concept. Unfortunately, the Prince of Darkness ascended 'on high' when the Papacy usurped the place of Jesus Himself, calling itself the 'Keeper' of the Faith: it is an article of belief among Catholic priests that, 'had it not been for the Catholic Church, Ch ristianity would not have survived' 52 . In other words, the Catholic priesthood and hierarchy 'take the credit' for preserving the faith - whereas of course the credit and the glory is entirely the Lo rd's and that of His Holy Spirit, which is responsible for quickening the faith of those who take the simple step of faith that is necessary for understa nding and salvation. SORCERY AND DEVILRY SHARED WITH SOUTH CAROLINA CHAPEL The master of black ceremonies, whom Malachi re ferred to as 'the Guardian', saw to it that all the grosser manifestations of devilry would be exported to an 'Authorized Targeting Chapel' in South Carolina. The pentagram, th e black candles and the appropriate Satanic draperies were retained for the Black Mass to be held in Rome. But certain other Rubrics - like the Bowl of Bones, the Ritual Din, the sacrificial animals and the human victim - could not be deployed in Rome: that was considered too risky. Hence the need for a Parallel Enthronement, or Concelebration, in an 'Author ized Targeting Chapel'. Over to Malachi, who was now explaining how sorcery is used to eliminate distance: 'Provided all the participants in both locations 'targeted' every element [i.e. every Rubric - Ed.] of 'The Event' on the Roman Chapel, then 'The Ev ent' in its fullness would be accomplished specifically in the target area' 53 . By 'Evenf was meant the evocation and summoning up of the Devil himself. 'It would all be a matter of unanimity of hearts, identity of intention and perfect sychronization of words and actions between the Targeting Chapel and the Target Chapel..... For a man as experienced as the Guardian, the selection of the Targeting Ch apel was easy. As simple as a phone call to the United States. Over the years, the Prince's adherents in Rome had developed a faultless unanimity of heart and a seamless id entity of intention with the Guardian's friend, Leo, Bishop of the Chapel in South Carolina' 54 . As has been be discussed in Chapter 5, Ch arleston, South Carolina, is the parallel seat with Rome of the Scottish and Palladian Sorcery Rites, established by the sorcerer and necromancer Albert Pike, who assumed total cont rol of Scottish and Palladian Rite ritual and dogma, while Pike's sorcerer-colleague Giuseppe Mazzini, founder of the modern Mafia, assumed responsibility for high-level (g lobal) Political Action. Mafia stands for 'Mazzini Authorises Thefts, Arson, Poisoning' in Illuminist Italian code: ' Mazzini Autorizza Furti, Incendi, Avvelenamenti'(M. A. F. I. A.) 55 . A careful reading of Malachi's Prologue re veals that 'Leo, Bishop of the Chapel in South Carolina' had established this venue 40 years previously: 'In the forty years or so since His Excellency had established his Chapel, the number and the social importance of the Participants he had attracted, the punctilious blasphemy of his Ceremonies and his frequent and ready cooperation with those who shared his point of view [Author: i.e., those who sought or who already manifested demonic possession] and ultimate goals,"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 371 had so established the superiority of his operation that by now it was widely admired among initiates as the Mother [Satanic] Chapel in the United States.... The news that this Chapel [of Satan] had been Authorised as th e Targeting Chapel for such a great event as the Enthronement of the Prince [of Darkness] within the heart of the Roman Citadel itself was supremely gratifying' 56 . When not officiating at Satanic ceremonies, the Bishop of the South Carolina Chapel was an American Catholic Bishop: an 'angel of light'. To 'The Event' in the Chapel of St Paul, the Guardian invited, or ordered the attendance of, 'high-ranking churchmen, and laymen of s ubstance. Genuine Servitors of the Prince within the Citadel. Some had been selected, co-opted, trained and promoted in the Roman Phalanx over the decades, while others represented the new generation dedicated to carrying the Prince's agenda [i.e., the agenda of the Prince of Darkness, Lucifer] forward for the next several decades. All understood the need to remain undetected; for the Rule says: \"The Guarantee of Our Tomorrow Is Today's Persuasion That We Do Not Exist\" 57 . In other words, keeping these reprobate Luciferians' wholesale acceptance of Satan secret was of paramount importance, the corollary being that EXPOSURE of their Satanic obsession and possession would have adverse consequences for 'the agenda'. For the Illuminati know that humanity fundamentally rejects th eir evil prescription. One prominent US intelligence operative, a man referred to in the late CIA cover author Claire Sterling's 'Thieves' World' as 'Mr X', recently went as white as a sheet when evidence was alluded to in his presence that he , too, had helped himself to funds that did not belong to him 58 : fear of exposure drained all the bl ood from his head, in the presence of one of the Author's contacts. When the Devil is really serious, he makes himself invisible 59 : but his adherents know that the Devil, Lucifer himself, cannot be trusted, which is why they are paranoid about secrecy and the constant danger of exposure. Their subsconscious worries routinely entail induced premature ageing as they struggle with the conflicting forces and loyalties competing for their 'cooperation'. The parallel Black Masses were to be coordinated with the assistance of a telephone link, and the occult ceremonies were to be said in flawless Latin. 'During 'The Event', the pulse of every Participant's heart mu st be perfectly attuned to make hate, not love', with the Gratification of Pain and the Consummation being 'perfectly achieved' and coordinated. And Malachi described the objective - the summoning up of the Devil himself, as prescribed in the 'Ancient Mysteries' - in the following obliquely colourful language: 'Finally, if everyone did the needful exactly according to the Rule, the Prince would at long last Consummate his Most Ancient Revenge upon the Weakling [Jesus], the Merciless Enemy who had paraded through the ages as the Most High Merciful One for whom the darkness of darkness was light enough to see all' 60 . Lucifer, who turns everything upside down, was to take the place of Jesus, according to the mad and misinformed intention of the false priests who were really sorcerers - the only problem being that, as is always the case, the followers of Lu cifer are, quite pathetically, themselves invariably deceived by Lucifer and his minions: for Jesus does not reign at the Vatican at all. How could that possibly ever have been the case? The human body is the temple, or vessel, of the Holy Spirit 61 , not the Vatican - where Lucifer has, as the Papacy's sordid and reprobate history [see preceding accounts] proclaims, actually been enthroned all along, ever since its probable foundation by Simon Magus - there being no historical evidence whatsoever that Simon Peter, who was married and served effectively as the Apostle to the Circumcision in Jerusalem, was ever in Rome. No scriptural authority for this obvious fabrication, critical to papal 'legitimacy', exists."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"372 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light SIMON MAGUS VS. THE GREAT AND BELOVED APOSTLE SIMON PETER On the contrary, the Simon Peter of Roman Catholicism is clearly Simon Magus, as is evident not least from the following assertion by the leading Catholic historian, Werner Keller, who had this to say about the death and burial of 'Simon Peter', a.k.a. Simon Magus: 'On the night of his death on the cross, Peter's followers buried his body. As in the case of Jesus on the hill of Calvary, it was wrapped in linen and secretly taken to a pagan burial ground on the Via Cornelia, behind the stone structure of the arena. This pagan cemetery lay on a knoll called vaticanus (Vatican Hill): the Latin word vatis means a 'prophet' or 'soothsayer' 62 . In days gone by, there had been an Etruscan oracle on the spot', although a temple of Mithra s has since been discovered. It will be recalled that Peter, an older, married man, who had once employed the two sons of Zebedee as his fishing hands, was outrun by the much younger disciple, John, to the tomb of Jesus. John outra n him because he was much younger than Peter, who owned the fishing business. As a much older man, Peter was, after the Resurrection of Jesus, well established in Jerusalem, where he had a home - as is amply confirmed in the Acts of the Apostles - and served the new Christians there. No scriptural or any other authority exists for the Catholic myth that Peter was ever in Rome: on the contrary, it is made plain in Acts that a division of labour was agreed between Paul and Peter, with Paul being sent, and agreeing to be sent by the Lord, to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, while Peter remained based in Jerusalem, where he was subjected to the temptation of conforming to the Pharisaical 'law' and had to be severely admonished for this backsliding by Paul - which admonishment the brave and endearing Peter accep ted in humility, before Paul left on his many travels, ending (according to the written record) in Rome. In The Epistle of Paul to the Galatians, Chapter 2, verse 7, Paul states that 'the gospel of the uncircumcision (the Gentiles) was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision (the Jews who had and were to become Christians) was unto Peter' 63 . The other component of this myth - that the Lord told Simon Peter that 'upon this rock I will build my church', and that the 'r ock' or (Greek) petra (a rock as well as a 'peter', a word for priest), was Peter himself, is also false. It is perfectly clear from the full context in Matthew, Chapter 16, that Jesus' use of the word 'rock' here was a reference to Peter's extraordinary faith, and that Jesus meant that it would be upon faith as rock-like as that of Peter that his spiritual church would be built. The Catholic Church takes the text out of context in order to sustain its mythology that Peter is the first Pope and the holder of the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, which Jesus said elsewhere is 'within you' 64 . The full Scripture [Matthew, Chapter 16, verses 13-19] is crystal clear: 'When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some say that thou are John the Baptist; some Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And (the simple fisherman) Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ ('the Anointed One'), th e Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven. And I also say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock (of your wonderful faith) I will build my church; and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against if (meaning that the Gates of Hell cannot extinguish our faith in Him, once we cease to know of Him, and know Him instead). 'And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoev er thou shalt loose"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 373 on earth shall be loosed in heaven' 65 . In other words, the key to the Kingdom of Heaven, which is 'within you', is faith: all we need to do to find Jesus and to be encouraged through the Grace of the Holy Spirit to seek sa lvation, is to give up fighting once and for all, and to accept that the Lord is indeed King of Kings and Lo rd of Lords, and to believe: one simple, genuine act of faith is all that is necessary. THE SECOND CONCECRATION OF LUCIFER IN THE CITADEL OF ROME The Concecration of Lucifer, then, was to be a second coronation for the Evil One in the Rome Citadel, so to speak. On this occasion, as at the beginning, the intention of the Evil One would not be to destroy the (Catholic) Church, but to 'convert' it into an instrument of Satan, or rather, into a more decisive instrument of the Evil One than previously. Just as evil people know and recognise others in a similar state of perdition, so did Lucifer perceive, correctly that the reprobate Vatican could be 'made much better use of, following Lucifer's 'second' Enthronement, which would 'create a perfect covering opaque and velvet smooth, to conceal the Prince (of Darkness) within the official Church membership of the Roman Citadel. Enthroned in Darkness, the Prince would be able to foment that same Darkness as never before. Friend and foe would be affected alike. Darkness of will would become so profound that it would obscure even th e official objective of the Citadel's (i.e. The Vatican's) existence.... In time, and at last, the Goat would expel the Lamb and enter into Possession of the Citadel' 66 . The gathering of notables who attended the Black Mass in the Chapel of St Paul rep- resented, according to Malachi, 'the current harvest of the Prince Tradition (that is, of high Satanists and Luciferians) that had been planted, nurtured within the ancient Citadel over a period of some eighty years' 67 . Subtracting 80 years from 1963, we have the year 1883. 'The Order of the Palladium', founded originally in 1730, was introduced in Charleston but remained inactive until 1886, when Albert Pike, who died and descended to hell in 1891, revived it under the name 'Reformed Palladium'; where upon it gave new, deeply secret, demonic impulse to the 'workings' of 'High Ma sonry'. As Malachi now explained: 'Though restricted in numbers for a time, the group has persisted in protective obscurity as a foreign body and an alien spirit within its host and victim. It permeated offices and activities throughout the Roman Citadel, spreading its symptoms through the bloodstream of the Church Universal like a subcutaneous infection. Sympto ms like cynicism and indifference, malfeasance and misfeasance in high office, inattention to correct doctrine, neglect of moral judgment, loss of acuity in sacral observance, blurring of essential memories and of the words and gestures that bespoke them' 68 . Meanwhile the American Target ing Chapel, a large assembly hall in the basement of a parochial school in South Carolina, the State of the 'Mother Lodge' of the Scottish and Palladian Rites in Charleston, had been prepared for the gruesome parallel Black Mass, with a red-veiled Pentagram flanked by two black candles arranged with a large crucifix pointing north. There was a red sanctuary lamp with its Ritual Flame, and at the east end of the altar a cage, in which sat, terrified, Flinnie, a seven-week-old puppy, mildly sedated for his brief moment of usefulness to the Prince of Darkness. Other accoutrements included the Red and Black Pillars from which hung the Snake Shield and the Bell of Infinity. On the east wall were vials containing Earth, Air, Fire and Water, surrounding a second cage containing a dove. The Bowl of Bones was located on the west side nearest the door. To the east was displayed the Crescent Moon and the usual Five-Pointed Star with the Goat-Points raised upwards."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"J/37 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light In the Vatican Chapel of St Paul, the black-robed and black-dressed Participants 'passed by the Bowl of Bones, dipped in thei r hands to receive small fistfuls, and took their places in the semicircle of chairs facing the Altar. As the Bowl of Bones was depleted and the kneeler chairs filled, the Ritual Din began to shatter the silence. Ceaselessly rattling the bones, each Participant began talking - to himself, to others, to the Prince. To no-one. Not raucously at first, but in an unsettling ritual cadence.... The mumbling cadence swelled from a softly cacophonous susurro. The steadily mounting gibberish of prayer and pleading and bone rattling developed a kind of controlled heat. The sound became angry, as if verging on violence. Became a controlled concert of chaos. A mind-gripping howl of Hate and Revolt. A concentrated prelude to the celebration of the Enthronement of the Prince of This World within the Citadel of the Weakling' 69 . Malachi Martin's book is called a novel: but at the New York breakfast in the Irish hotel, Malachi told the Author that his description of the abominations that took place in parallel in the Chapel of St Paul and the 'Chapel' in South Carolina represented accurate descriptions of what had taken place on that fate ful day in 1963, shortly after the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. In the South Ca rolina chapel, a young girl, drugged for the occasion but fully conscious, was handed to the sorcerer-in-chief by her cold-hearted father and ritually violated before the attending Luciferians while the frightened puppy, which had wagged its tail as it was taken out of its cage, was vivisected alive. CHURCH TO BE TR ANSFORMED INTO 'THE UNI VERSAL CHURCH OF MAN After the ritual brutalities, the assembled priests and notables evoked the Devil, chanting to the Ritual Din, a triumphant profanation of the hymn of the Apostle Paul: 'Maran Atha! Come, Lord! Come, O Prince. Come, Come! I believe in the Only Begotten Son of the Cosmic Dawn... And his name is Lucifer... I believe in the Mysterious One... And he is the Snake with venom in the Apple of Life.... I believe in the Ancient Leviathan': invocations and responses followed in cascades. The main pa rt of the Vatican ritual was then brought to a close with the following proclamation by Bishop Leo: 'I believe that the Prince of this World will be Enthroned this night in the Ancient Citadel, and from there he will create a New Community', to which the response was chanted: And Its Name will be the Universal Church of Man'. In the course of this grisly description - which Fr. Martin, as an accomplished exorcist, was well qualified to write - he pointed out that 'a Prussi an fellow', who hailed from Berlin, had arrived just before the commencement of the Black Mass in the Chapel of St Paul. This German was of exceptional significance, then as in 2006: 'Not yet forty, he was already a man of im portance in certain critical transnational affairs. Even the light from the black tape rs glinted off his steel-rimmed glasses and his balding head, as if to single him out. Chosen as International Delegate and Plenopotentiary Extraordinary to the Enthronement' (of the Prince of Darkness in the Vatican), 'the Prussian carried the leather pouch containing the Letters of Authorization and Instructions to the Altar before he took his place in the semicircle' 70 . Dr Henry Alfred Kissinger, the 'mentor' of George H. W. Bush (Busche) Sr., who advised President Ford to dismiss William Colby and to replace him with Bush Sr., was bom Heinz Alfred Kissinger in Germany on 27th May 1923. He was in fact just 40 when the Double Black Mass Abomination led from the Vatican, took place in 1963. Letters of Authorization and Instructions?

What did this mean? At the end of the Ceremo ny in the Chapel of St Paul, we read in Malachi's text, as follows: 'Only the Authorization, the Bill of Instructions and the Evidence remained. The Guardian looked up from the Altar and turned cheerless eyes toward the Prussian International Delegate who had brought the leather pouch containing the Letters of Authorization and Instructions. All watched as he left his place and strode to the Altar, took the pouch in hand, removed the papers it contained, and read out the Bill of Authorization in a heavy (German) accent: \"By mandate of the Assembly and the Sacrosanct Elders, I do institute, authorize and recognize this Chapel, to be k nown henceforth as the Inner Chapel, as taken, possessed and appropriated wholly by Him Whom we have Enthroned as Lord and Master of our human fate. Whosoever shall, by means of this Inner Chapel, be designated and chosen as the final In-the-Line (i.e. the papal line from 'Simon Peter') successor in the Petrine Office, shall by his very oath of office commit himself and all he does command to be the willing instrument and collaborator with the Builders of Man's Home on Earth and throughout man's Cosmos. He shall transform the ancient Enmity' (of Christians) 'into Friendship, Tolerance and Assimilation as these are applied to the models of birth, education, work, finance, commerce, industry, learning, culture, living and giving life, dying and dealing death. So shall the New Age of Man be modelled'. And the assembled, deluded, worldly fools responded: 'So mote it be!' Turning to the penultimate item on the agenda, the International Delegate from Berlin read out the oath before the Luciferians assembled in the Chapel of St Paul: 'Do you each and all, having heard the Authorization, now solemnly swear to accept it willingly, unequivocally, immediately, without reservation or cavil?' And the fools and idiots cried in unison: 'We do'. 'Do you each and all now solemnly swear th at your administration of office will be bent to fulfil the [Luciferian, worldly] aims of the Universal Church of Man?' And they responded: 'We do so solemnly swear'. 'Are you each and all prepared to signal this unanimous will with your own blood, so strike you Lucifer, if you are unfaithful to this Oath of Commitm ent?' 'We are willing and prepared'. And finally, the International Delegate from Berlin demanded: 'Are you each and all fully consenting that, by this Oath, you transfer Lordship and Possession of your souls from the Ancient Enemy [Jesus Christ], the Supreme Weakling, to the Ail-Powerful Hands of our Lord Lucifer?' And the lost, obtuse, perverted, reprobate idiots, powerful Princes of the Catholic Church and from all the world's corridors of power, responded: 'We consent'. What they consented to with one accord was the immediate launch of the continuing frenzied 'Ritual Din' offensive against the whol e of Mankind, which has been accentuated ever since - as abomination follows further abomination in pursuit of the Luciferians' insistence that we must adopt the Nazi pagan New Age of An tichrist and the 'Do as Thou Wilt' 'Ancient Mysteries', opening the floodgates of the Permissive Society, and unleashing upon civilisation the filthy prospectus of the German Illuminati and their foul vices, in toto. The final demonic ritual, The Evidence, was then performed. As Malachi described this final scene, 'with the two documents positioned on the Altar, the International Delegate from Berlin held out his left hand to the Guardian. With a golden pin, the granite-faced Roman pricked the tip of the Delegate's left thumb and pressed a bloody print beside the Delegate's name on the Bill of Authorization'."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"376 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE ABUSED GIRL CONFRONTED BISHOP LEO Quickly then, the Vatican participants appe nded their pinpricked bloody fingers as well. When every member of what Malachi called the Vatican Phalanx had satisfied the last Ritual requirement, a little silver bell was rung in the Chapel of St Paul. And in the American Chapel, the Bell of Infinity rang its assenting response, while both congregations chanted: 'Ding! Dong! Dell • Thus shall the Ancient Gate s [of Hell] Prevail • Thus the Rock and the Cross must fail • Forever! • Ding! Dong! Dell!' Malachi concluded this detailed description of The Evenf by noting that as 'the members of the Roman Phalanx emerged into the Court of St Damascus in the small hours of the feast day of SS Peter and Paul ... some of the Cardinals and a few of the bishops acknowledged the salutes of the r espectful security guards with an absent- minded cross of priestly blessing traced in the air, as they entered their limousines'. The obvious question arises: was Malachi hi mself present at 'The Event' - the Second Enthronement of Lucifer in the Vati can? In the 1960s, Malachi may have been a 'radical priest'. This was not the case when the Author knew him. He told the Author, before his book was published, that he was a bout to expose this abomination, and he described what the expose would contain. About 18 months la ter, the Author was invited to a luncheon in New York to which Malachi had been invited, but, at the Author's suggestion, had declined to attend (because, as the Author had surmised, the invitation had been extended for a selfish purpose). On that occasion, the Author fell into conversation with a gentleman, described by Malachi to the Author afterwards as 'a man full of Grace', who recounted the following story. He said that he knew the girl, Agnes, who had been abused on the Altar at the Chapel in South Carolina. At a later stage in her life, she had decided (very riskily) to confront the bishop who had abused her during this unspeakable Satanic ritual in 1963. Accompanied by a priest, she arrived at the bishop's private residence. The reprobate Catholic cleric answered the door himsel f. On seeing Agnes, whom he could not possibly have seen subsequent to the abomination and whose appearance would have changed as she was now much older, the bishop let out a demonic tirade of obscenities, blasphemies and foul language which was of such demonic force that Agnes and her priest friend had to retr eat without saying a word. The purpose of the fo regoing is not to condemn the Catholic Church. In case sterile religious bias is at once alleged, the Author adds here that he considers that Dr Rowan Williams, the present Archbishop of Canterbury, who is a graduate of the Author's own Oxford college, Christ Church, is himself a walking abomination, for having allowed himself to be inducted into a High Degree of the Druids, thereby spreading confusion*. *This is the appropriate place to cite the Lord's parable of the tares [Matthew, Chapter 13, verses 24-30]: 'Another parable pu t he forth unto them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his ene my came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeare d the tares also. So the servants of the household came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From w hence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gathe r them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest;: and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn'. Churches rarely explain the meaning of this parable, and for an obvious reason: it is directed against them! The clue as to its meaning is obtained by considering the actual meaning of the word 'tares'. This English word means a weed called darnel, which has the following peculiar characteristic: when it is young, it resembles young wheat, but as it grows its appearance cha nges, so that by the time of the harvest it is distinguishable from the wheat. The point is that for a considerable period, the tares (d arnel) cannot be distinguished from the wheat. We have reached the stage of spiritual understanding at which we can more clearly now distingu ish the wheat from the darnel. The wheat are those who 'know His voice' and who, despite the evil we must confront, seek to order t heir lives in accordance with His Word. These are to be gathered into His barn. The darnel represents all those sorcerers, false pri ests, reprobate ministers, worldly and money-making charlatans who use the 'Jesus' label [see later in this chapter for more examples] as a convenient cover for their nefarious activities. In the present context, the Author cites this parable in order to make it clea r to anyone who may be so concerned, that he is not condemning Catholics, since the reaper will distinguish between those Catholics who ind eed 'know the Lord', despite all the distractions the church places in their way, and those who remain blind."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 377 WHAT DID THAT 'M' ON THE LATE POPE'S COFFIN STAND FOR - SERIOUSLY? The death of Pope John Paul II in 2005 was 'celeb rated' by a globally televised funeral ritual on 8th April, which struck many as representing a celebration not of the late Pope, but of death itself. Reuters called that Event as 'one of the most momentous funerals in history' - which could have meant that more human beings were subjected to this gratuitous death- spectacle than had ever been contrived befo re. The 'Great and the Good' (meaning the allegedly bad and the lost) were assembled from all over the world, to attend a formal religious service at which some of their most prominent number stared with an expressionless, glassy-eyed gaze at the coffin (casket for US readers). The repulsive ritual of showing the dead Pontiff and raising the corpse for the assembled people and the whole world to see, was followed by TV shots of the unusually shaped coffin (casket) taken from above, revealing it to be of trapezoid form, and that it carried an oddly-described cross with the capital letter M - the 13th letter of the alphabet - inscribed in the lower right-hand corner [see Figure 61 on page 379]. The questions ar ise: why was the cross mis-shapen, and what was the meaning of the letter M? Did it refer to Mary, as of course Catholics were tacitly invited to believe, or to Malta (if the late Pope was a Knight of Malta), or did it, by any chance, actually mean Magus? The trapezoid shape of the late Pope's coff in diverged, of course, from the normal coffin shape. The late Pope John Paul II had Nazi co nnections in his early days, and is believed to have been a salesman for Zyklon-B, the deadly gas used in the Nazi gas chambers. An organisation calling itself The Order of the Trapezoid - yet another one of these Illuminati organisations calling itself The Order - has been identified as one of ten 'magickal' Orders loyal to the Temple of Set, based in San Francisco, an organisation of Satanists openly presided over by Dr. Michael A. Aquino, a US mi litary intelligence officer who is notorious in the United States as a perpetrator of Himmlerian US occultic intelligence experimentation. In a response dated 14th November 1990 to criticisms of his activities, Aquino himself described how The Order of the Trapezoid features, along with 'several specialised Orders within the Temple of Set', as a component of its structures 'somewhat analogous to the departments of a university'. The Satanist Aquino continued, revealing the wide range of Himmlerian investigations with which the Orde r of Set was and is engaged on behalf of US 'Black' intelligence, as follows: 'In actuality, this particular Order is concer ned with a great many areas of research, of which North European (including Nazi German) occultism is only one. Others include time/space sciences, proxemics, art and ar chitecture (particularly Expressionism, Art Nouveau/Deco/Moderne), electronics (Tesla et al), film noir, Lovecraftian literature, music and the electromagnetic spectrum, mental sciences et c'. In other words, these - revealingly - are among the areas where intelligence investigators have sought to apply or merge occult skills for secret mind- and personality-control purposes. THE ORDER OF THE TRAPEZOID: FASCINATED WITH NAZI GERMANY Aquino then admitted that the Order of the Tr apezoid is interested in Nazi Germany, while playing down such interest. In reality , Nazi Germany was the second large-scale Black regime to have been established by the Illuminati in the 20th century, its purpose being to provide the missing dialectical foil (the false 'opposite' mechanistic 'force') to Communism, which had been established following the subversive activities of the German agent Rasputin, and the German agents Lenin and (probably) Leon Trotsky (Braunstein). A primary preoccupation among the Uluminati today is to extend what was"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"378 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light learned from the experience of the first two large-scale Black Illuminati regimes - and which was replicated along Jesuitical-Nazi lines in Communist China, Cambodia, Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Syria and elsewhere - to the whole world. According to Aquino, 'to the extent that Th e Order [of the Trapezoid] is interested in Nazi Germany, it is essentially with regard to the very extensive research into occultism conducted by the Ahnenerbe and other groups and individuals during that period'. Aquino, associated with such Himmlerian occult rese arch in the United States, approaches these issues as though the investigations in questi on represent legitimate areas of research - whereas dabbling in the occult is decisively forbidden in Scripture and is anathema to all who know the Lord Jesus Christ, and also to Jews who adhere to the Torah only. In the absence of such knowledge and understa nding, enquiring about, let alone intermeddling with, the occult is to play with fire. The Order of the Trapezoid has a document in which it explains its behaviour as follows: 'The Order of the Trapezoid extracts th e positive, the constructive, the exalted, and the romantic from the Germanic magical traditi on - and just as carefully avoids and rejects those excesses, distortions and cruelties which have made this tradition an object of the most extraordinary fear, condemnation, and suppression in the postwar period. The Germanic tradition is also part of the legacy of the Prince of Darkness, hence is appropriate to an Order within the Temple of Set, which embraces all manifestations of the Powers of Darkness in the world'. The truth, for once, from a horse's mouth. This extraordinary admission reveals, once again, how these deluded fools are themselves fooled by Lucifer himself, whom they purport to revere as God. The notion that an occultist dabbling in Black Magick can pick and choose which element of magick to 'accept' and what is 'unacceptable' or unwise, is disingenuous and fanciful - since the occultist is in severe danger of becoming the possessed, and can never control the dark powers that wind up controlling him or her; and in any case, the le t-out in this context is contradicted by The Order's assertion that its membership within the Temple of Set means that it is part of the Germanic Satanic tradition 'which embraces all manifestations of the Powers of Darkness'. Hence, the claim that The Order selects what elements of magick to accept and what elements to reject, is a braze n lie which is contradicted in its own literature. A second paragraph elaborated on this non-sequitur. 'Nevertheless, the care required in any invest igation into this [German occult] tradition cannot be overemphasized. Magical and research ability are not enough; ethical sensitivity and social discretion are just as important. The prospects for new and wondrous perspectives on the Black Art [sic] are exhilarating, but success will come only if The Order conducts its affairs with the same dedication and nobility that have made The Temple of Set a legend in its time'. Of course, the word 'nobility ' as applied to the foul Temple of Set is an absurdity: for how can anything to do with the pornographic, brutal, murderous, deceitful, lying activities of sorcerers ever contain a shred of nobility? Once again, we are confronted with the ch ief characteristic of these deluded people: their chaotic double-mindedness. Most of th ese people are capable of being perfectly charming, most of the time - and note that the Author has italicised the syllable charm here. A snake-charmer is a sorcerer who casts charms on snakes. The most adept among these people exercise their charm liberally: they seduce targets by being charming to them, so that it is always hard to resist their charming pe rsonalities.

A statement made earlier, in a different context, is reversed later, in a new context. Preferences previously expressed are subsequently overturned. Then, one day, without any warning, this charming pers on switches, revealing the other, nastier, personality masked by the charm. One should perhaps always be on guard against people who suddenly 'come at one' with charm. In the author's experience, this is a danger signal. Excessive charm at the outset of a relationship can be suspect. Double-mindedness is also reflected, as has been discussed, in the maintenance of opposite perspectives or even personalities simultaneously. In a 'worst case scenario', therefore, this would enable Pope Benedict XVI to pronounce, with fervour, his veneration for Klement August von Galen as an intrepid oppon ent of Nazi pagan ideology, while at the same time condoning the Nazi pagan ideology that was re-consecrated in the Chapel of St Paul on 29th June 1963. SECRECY IS A STRAIN: SO THEY DISTRIBUTE CLUES TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE A peculiar feature of secretive, autocratic and Illuminati-related organisations is their propensity to display clues as to their true allegiance. Almost all the oil multinationals do so by the use of corporate logos which cont ain esoteric symbols; and the same goes for many multinational pharmaceutical companie s: such symbols inform 'the interested' among the Illuminati of the corporations' true 'spiritual' alle giance and geomasonic orientation. A US intelligence software spy bundle called 'Illuminable' is pre-installed on new computers (as of July 2006). A study of papal coats-of-arms will reveal the presence of the same five-pointed stars (Pyt hagorean pentalphas) that are familiar on the flags and insignia of nation states and supranational organisations such as the United States, the European Union, Iraq, Libya, Ghana and ot hers. Whenever Saddam Hussein was televised for both domestic and international public co nsumption, he was positioned at a desk adjacent to a large Iraqi flag, arranged so th at the single large five-pointed star was prominently displayed to occupy a good third of the television screen; and Colonel Qaddhafy does the same. The purpose of displaying the five-pointed star is always identical: to inform 'the interested' that the principal, country or entity concerned is a fully paid-up member of the globalist geomasonic Illuminist Brotherhood and network. The trapezoid shape of the late Pope's coffin, and the peculiar M on the coffin lid, were similar examples of this eccentric need to display one's true allegiance. One general supplementary reason for this 'need' is that the occupants of high office are desperately lonely. By 12th October 2005, President Ge orge W. Bush Jr. had visited the New Orleans area no less than eight times - so great, cynics suggested, was his occult interest in that place of death, but more probably b ecause his handlers had ordered him to make these depressing visits, in a vain attempt to buttress this lonely man's battered reputation. Left to his own devices, he would have preferred to stay in the White House. All occupants of high office, having been alternatively enticed by lust for power - Ratzinger certainly made no secret of his ambition to become Pope - find that the downside is desperate loneliness and effective imprisonment in office, with almost all their moves dictated by intelligence handlers. The US President has several handlers and the British Prime Minister likewise. And this, by the way, is al so true nowadays of British and US newspaper editors and their key staff: The focus of news providers, on any given day or hour, results from intelligence agency directiv es, according to reputable au thorities including myriad retired news officials and intelligence officers' 71 ."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 381 A BENEDICT SUPERVISED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SATANIC INQUISITION A contemporary UK Templar, Tim Acheson, to ld a local newspaper in Hertfordshire, England, in April 2005, that Cardinal Ratzinger had chosen the name Benedict because of its association with the Templars. He reportedly informed 'The Hertfordshire Mercury' newspaper cryptically that 'the Pontiff chose Benedict as his papal title, a name with special significance to the Knight s Templar. The Rule of the Templars, which is like a code of conduct for The Order, was originally know n as the Rule of Benedict'. Ratzinger, as previously noted, was head of the contemporary manifestation of the Inquisition -the notorious arm of the Church set up by the Jesuits to investigate, persecute or eliminate its enemies. In December 2004, the Knights Templar, who have a base in Hertfordshire, demanded a papal apology by the year 2007 for their persecution by the Papacy 700 years ago*. This demand, which the Vatican said it was 'seriously considering', made world headlines, after being revealed by 'The Merc ury', appearing in several British newspapers, including 'The Independent' and \"T he Guardian'. According to 'T HE Mercury', before his 'election' to the Papacy, Ratzinger contacted a leading Hertfordshire historian and a records officer at Hertfordshir e County Hall. An anonymous source told 'The Mercury' that the Bavarian Cardinal approached the local history expert Dr Alan Thompson; and it was also carefully and pointedly emphasised that the Pope's homeland, Bavaria, is 'also the homeland of a mysterious secret society, the Illuminati'. 'T HE Mercury's' source also claimed that the former Cardinal telephoned the envir- onmental officer of Hertfordshire County Council, Ms. Alison Tinneswood, who sub- sequently sought refuge behind the UK 'Data Protection Act' and refused to answer any questions 72 . Why would Cardinal Ratzinger have contacted the County's environmental officer, other than to investigate the possibility of a (Templar) exhumation? JESUIT SPY-MANIA - THE MODEL FOR MODERN INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES It is bad enough that the odious Papal Inquisition, a murderous manifestation of Satanic blood-lust, should have been invent ed and established by the founder of those 'Angels of Light', the Jesuits. Another of the Jesuits' legacies to huma nity has been their secret intelligence service blueprint. All inte lligence services today, and most of their nefarious practices, are modelled, to a greater or lesser extent, upon the Jesuit precedent. Under the Jesuit Constitutions, the chief occupati on of Jesuit spies, or 'syndici', is to watch fellow Jesuits, and to send 'informaciones' about them to the local Provincial, or else to the General himself, at the Jesii, in Ro me. Novices are taught the art of official and unofficial spying on their fellow Jesuits, under the rubric of 'm anifestation of faults' -the same technique as was and is employed by Moral Re-armament to strip targeted individuals of all natural personality protecti on mechanisms, and to deprive them of their psychological integrity. Spying is put before Novices as 'a holy and salutary practice' 73 . The necessity for spying is justified by the n eed for 'progress in humility', 'progress in spiritual perfection', and so 'that the Superior may know them better' 74 . As the author of an expose of the Jesuits wrote in the 1920s: 'Naturally, raw recruits, mostly merely boys, do not fully understand what is involved in the denunciatory sys- * Although this Author has little time for Dan Brown and his novels, Mr Brown was correct when he made the recorded statement t hat 'Ratzinger is on record as suggesting that Freemasonry was set up to persecute Christianity, and it is the revenge of the Templ ars that the Church fears, since the origin of Freemasonry is rooted in the persecution of the Templars by the Church'. Of course 'the C hurch' is not to be confused with Jesus Christ and His Word, with which the Inquisition has nothing to do, given that it represented the unrestrained Works of Darkness perpetrated in His Name. A further dimension emerges from Ratzinger's statement here. When the great period of cathedral-building had come to an end, the masons' cartels or trade guilds which had been maintained by the bui lders in order to prevent the Church 'gouging' their price structures, were left without a purpose. So their 'dead' framework was taken over by the Templars."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"382 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light tern thus explained in a pious homily on Ch ristian charity. Neither have they any con- ception what secret government means. They are asked if they are willing to have their faults manifested to Superiors, and if they ar e willing in charity to manifest the faults of others, and they express their consent. They take it for granted that what they have been told is a \"holy and salutary religious practice\", is quite above-board and honourable. They readily agree to the system without understanding what it entails. If afterwards, as often happens, when they come to see its evils and dangers, they make any protest, they are reminded of their acceptance of the system when it was explained to them in the Noviceship' 75 . It is then that they start to realise that they are trapped. The Jesuit espionage system is so comprehe nsive that Headquarters is kept fully informed about every Jesuit in The Order. This is achieved by means of an elaborate reporting system, similar to the endless reports that are routinely generated by the European Commission's corrupt paper-shuffling structures. The first layer of espionage entails a general system of official reports from Superiors, Consultors, Procurators and from special Visitators sent from Rome by the General. Ever y Provincial is required to send each month to Rome a complete report upon the Province under his charge, which means that he and his staff spend most of their time collecting inform ation on all the Jesuits within the Province. Local Superiors must report to Rome four tim es a year about all their subjects. Procurators proceed to Rome periodically - carrying with them their innumerable secret reports about members of their respective Jesuit Provinces. On certain occasions, so-called 'informatores' , four in number, are secretly nominated, and are ordered to deliver secret reports about individual Jesuits. This was the number of Jesuits who attended the session with the late P ope in 1981, described by Malachi Martin. The General and his Secretaries preserve these reports in archives, and a full record of the behaviour of every Jesuit in the world is ma intained at the Jesu. In addition to all these compulsory spying reports, an immense flow of voluntary documents is despatched to Rome by pious meddlers who spend a great deal of their time writing as they are privileged and enjoined to do, denunciatory letters about fellow Jesuits, an d about particular occurrences. These letters are marked 'soli', and they are placed directly into the hands of the General, who in due course acknowledges them personally. It is clear that Mao Tse-Tung's system of communal denunciation during the so-called Cultural Revolution in China was based upon th is Jesuitical system of institutionalised denunciation and reporting. Fidel Castro, a Jesuit-educated terrorist, uses the same Jesuitical procedures. It need hardly be said that such seething activity has nothing to do with the calm peace of Jesus Christ, who displayed 'the peace of God which passeth all understanding' 76 . When Jesus was explaining his mission and purpose to his disciples, in preparation for His Passion, he gave them these comforting words: 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid' 77 . And to the consternation of those who are in league with, or possessed by, the Prince of this World, those who accept His peace are not at all afraid of these reprobates. Manifestly, the gulf between the oppressive control system that the Jesuits institu- tionalised from the outset, and 'the peace of God which passeth all understanding' is unbridgeable, short of total repentance by the reprobates concerned. The Order - like all other Illuminist organisations callin g themselves The Order - is an invention of Satan, and is uniquely responsible for the model of institutionalised Jesuitical espionage and control methodology by criminalised inte lligence communities worldwide."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 383 THE CONFESSIONAL AS A SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR BLACKMAIL An even greater abomination w ithin the Jesuit Order is the ev il system of exploiting the Catholic 'Confessional'. In the Catholic syst em, priests are intermediaries and confession is made to the priest, who acts supposedly as intermediary with God. This is practice is of course a relic of the pagan and also of the Jewish Pharisaical system, both of which prescribed that the priesthood alone possessed the powers and information necessary to provide absolution or to mete out punishme nts for sins committed by the supplicant. 'Confession' is thus simply a device to ensure that the priesthood controls its target population and can levy financial demands upon its members. By contrast, Jesus made it plain that no man on earth (with the exception of one's natural father) is to be called father, since only God is Father 78 , and that Jesus is the sole intercessor with God for the sins of mankind 79 . 'It is Christ... who... maketh intercession for us' 80 . None other. In contravention of this simple instruction, the Catholic Pope is the Holy Father and all Catholic priests and male religious are Fath ers, consistently with the Catholic Church's reprobate practice of picking and choosing what elements of Scripture it will accept, what is to be elaborated, and what is to be igno red. The commensurately reprobate Church of England has of course take n to doing this as well. The Jesuits' oppressive 'Common Rules' prescribe that 'he who knows about the grievous temptation of another must give noti ce of it to the Superior, that he, in his fatherly care and providence, may supply a suitable remedy'. But prescribing remedies, or penances, is none of any human being's business, beyond that of the sinner himself. He has the option to ask for repentance through Jesus Christ, because he has Free Will (of which the Jesuit and other Illuminati Orders seek to depr ive their adherents). A fairly full grasp of the Jesuit Constitutions is necessary to understand the full meaning of the word 'temptation' in this context, and to realise what dire penalties the Superior, in his so-called 'fatherly care' as a hyperactive Angel of Li ght (driven by the 'seething energies' of Lucifer), may in his 'wisdom' de cide upon as 'suitable remedies' 81 . In the 'Instructions for Confessors', issued by the Seventh General Congregation of The Order, the fifth section allocates certain additional tasks to the 'sy ndici, who are appointed in every Jesuit house and college, and among every class of The Order, to watch and send in secret reports to Superiors'. The text reads: 'Let syndici be appointed... who shall watch and report to the Superior about long confessions (p rolix confessionibus), and also a bout protracted conversations in the Church, outside confes sions'. 'There was therefore no place sacred, not even the church [buildi ng itself], against the activities of Jesuit spies. Nor was confession, which good taste as well as honourable principles , shelters from observation, immune from the watchful eyes of the official syndici of The Order' 82 . 'During prayer time in Jesuit houses, that is , three times a day, official spies called \"visitors\" go from room to room, opening the doors without knocking in order to see if the Fathers are at their prayers. They have to keep records of the number of times each Father is absent at prayer time, or late for prayers. The \"Visitors\" report to the Superior at stated intervals' . The Order (that is to say, this manifestation of it) has insisted since the days of Ignatius Loyala upon the absolu te importance of its 'denunciat ory' system. The Jesuits' need for such an abominable control mechanism illustrates, of course, their fundamental insecurity, and the absence of the Holy Spirit among them - since if this Order were 'of the Holy Spirit', no such abom inably repressive control mechanism would be necessary. Significantly, the German Jesuit traditi on has always been especially keen on"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"384 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light denunciation as a primary compone nt of espionage. An official letter from the Bohemian Principal, a Father Bieczynski, cited by a Count von Hoensbroech, which was found in a Library in Vienna, contained the following injunction: 'How great a value we set on denunciation as the true eye of the Society, must be known to everybody.... Nor do those err who suppose that the greater part of the annoyances to which the Societ y is subject spring from ne glect and disregard of denun- ciation. It is therefore particularly enjoined on all, as loving sons of the Society, to pay due regard to a matter of such importance, and putting aside all considerations, in accordance with the spirit of our Institute' [which diverg es 100% from the Holy Spirit] 'truly and faithfully to report to the Superior everything which they judge in the Lord s hould be reported. They may rest assured that they are performing an office both grateful and advantageous to the welfare of the Society' [that is to say, to its own self-interest, which diverges from the interests of its members and from the Word of God], if they zealously strive after that which the safety of our Order requires of all in this respecf . THE PARANOID PSYCHOLOGY OF THE ORDER In other words, this is all about The Order's perpetual fear, given its manifest idolatry of control and power, that it will be undermined and destroyed from within - illustrating that it lacks faith in its own purpose and that it is not guided by the Holy Spirit, but rather by the spirit of the Prince of Darkness, who is the inventor and source of these components of its black, institutionalised system of internal repression and espionage. One historian has described the atmosphere among Jesuits at tim es of heightened Jesuit internal dissension, when the 'inmates' were more than usually seiz ed with the spirit of antagonism, as being bedevilled by a 'system of the most abominable espionage and tale-bearing', characterised by 'disorders attendant on se cret accusations'. According to Ranke, 'It was made the instrument of concealed ambition and of ha tred wearing the mask of friendship'. The historian of the Papacy added this quotation from a Jesuit theologian, Fr. Mariana, who reported as follows: 'Were anyone to read over the records sent in to Rome, he would perhaps not find a single upright ma n.... Universal distrust prevails' 85 . It came naturally to Fidel Castro, a Jesuit, who makes clandestine visits to 'superiors' in the United States, to install an espionage system in Cuba m odelled precisely upon this institutionalised Jesuitical system of espionage and denunciation. Count von Hoensbroech cited Bishop Palafox's report, in a letter to Pope Innocent X in the mid-17th century, in which the entire truth of this matter was exposed: 'What other Order has Constitutions which are not allowed to be seen, privileges which it conceals, and secret rules and everything related to the government of the Order hidden behind a curtain?' - contrary to the Word of God and the teaching of Jesus Christ, which is open and was given to us all openly: as Paul says: 'This thing was not done in a corner . 'The rules of every other Order may be seen by all the world.... But among the Jesuits there are even some of the Professed who do not know the Statutes, Privileges, and even the Rules of the Society, although they are pledged to observe them. Therefore they are not governed by their Superiors according to the rules of the Church, but according to certain concealed Statutes known by the Superior alone, and according to certain secret and pernicious denunciations, which leads to a large number being driven from the bosom of the Society' 87 . At the sixth General Congregation of The Order, any pretence that Jesuits retain any privacy or personal 'space' whatsoever was stripped bare. Specifically, it was pro-"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 385 vided that in 'accepting' the principle of de nunciation, Jesuit subjects 'thereby renounce their right to their personal good name and reputation in so far as such a right stands in the way of denunciation' 88 . Therefore, The Order snatches such natural rights from the naive boys and young men who have been enticed, or despatched by their deluded parents, into this sterile organisation in their innocence - courting the certainty of rampant disillusionment among their number as the scales fall from their eyes, as happens extensively over the years. A Jesuit is very liable to be denou nced falsely by a 'brother' Jesuit, and as a consequence dismissed, without being granted any opportunity to prove his 'innocence'; from which it follows that membership of this demonic Order is actually a precarious existence, lacking any form of security at all. Under modern employment legislation, such terms would be illegal. The diabolical nature of the internal espionage system is illustrated by the following: 'The Superior may, for the improvement of the accused, give him secret warnings and apprehensions; terrify him with threats (terre minis); set spies to watch him; change him from place to place; remove him from office; provide d always in so doing he does not violate the secret. This he must avoid doing by putting forward some plausible reasons as a pretext for the treatment he is meting out to the accused'. In other words, the Superior must lie (all the time) about his motives. Lies and deception are the weapons of Satan, not Jesus Christ, after whose name this Order is labelled. Satan is the Father of Lies, and of murder, his only product being spiritual (through lies and deception) and physical death. As Jesus told the Pharisees: 'Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no trut h in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of if' 89 . To disguise the true reasons for a dismissal so as to preserve the repressive secrecy considered necessary in order to 'protecf th e source, the Superior 'may proceed to the dismissal of the accused from the Order, \" not, however, in such a way that the crime which has been secretly reported to him may be made known to others in kind or species; but as though the dismissal were for other faults, coming to his knowledge from other sources; faults of a kind calculated to appear in the judgment of others a sufficient reason for the dismissal\"'. Of course, the 'dismissed' finds himself a lucky man: for suddenly, he is (relatively) free of the oppressive regime with in which he has lived, although he remains vulnerable to further snide denunciations even after leaving The Order. The author of this Jesuit expose (published in the 1920s) made the same point as this Author - namely, than none of this has anything to do with following Jesus Christ: 'There is, surely, guile enough, equivocation enough, and deception and tyranny enough in all this to justify one in thinking that the government of the Jesuit Order resembles very little Christ's government of his disciples. Yet all this is called \"paternal denunciation\". What is particularly interesting is the delicate attention and the courtesy shown to the informant. His permission is asked for this, that, and the other thing. He is flattered and consulted. He is protected ag ainst any inconvenience, lest he should be unwilling to play the informant again.... Inform ers are held in the highest esteem in The Order, that is, if they are efficient and accurate informers. They are thought to be loyal to The Order, true children of Saint Ignatius [sic!], and zealous about the Order's highest good'. They are in due time promoted, and they enjoy the confidence of Superiors. If, on the other hand, some' [correctly of course] 'cons ider it petty, mean, degrading, and the source of far more harm than good, to spy upon their neighbours, they are looked"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"386 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light upon as obstinate, independent, indifferent to the interests of The Order, and as being bereft of the true spirit of the Society'. Note the further imperative of having regard for the interest of The Order - that is to say, of th is man-made organisation - and the reference to 'the true spirit of the Society', which is of the Devil. Any Jesuit who understands the venal and evil nature of the Jesuit 'spirit of denunc iation' also understands, by definition, that this spirit is of the Evil One, and represents the opposite of the Holy Spirit. THE PECULIAR MAD AFFLICTIONS OF JESUITS Only a brief impression of the repressive nature of Jesuit rule and of The Order's espionage control system has been given. So oppressive is the system that not many Jesuits pass through their training by Th e Order without developing some form of eccentricity. The extreme tension of the Noviceship, especially following the exhaustion of the 'period of euphoria' and early years of study, followed by the steady, daily grind of repression in subsequent phases of the Jesuit's life, almost invariably trigger some pathological characteristic or other. According to one account, 'if one is interested in unusual facial expressions, in peculiar forms of abstracti on, in strange types of \"tic\", in subtle manifestations of hysteria or neurasthenia, or in bizarre obsessions, one should secure the hospitality of a Jesuit house and observe the community closely. If one remains long e nough, one without doubt will also have an opportunity of witnessing some of those s udden violent storms that burst without warning among men, who live at variance with the laws of nature, and in a high tension of internal repression' 90 . It has further been written that 'many Jes uits suffer from insomnia and headaches; many, especially among the younger members, have \"broken heads\" (obsessional neu- ralgia); many are melancholic; many scrupulous, and victims of phobias.... Persecution mania is, as might be expected from our st udy of the Jesuit espionage system, exceedingly common. A Jesuit tainted with this malady believes that everyone is plotting against him; reporting him to his Superior; watching wh ere he goes and what he does; scheming to deprive him of whatever privileges he enjoys; and in general, determined to ruin him. He suspects every one, and retires more and more into himself.... One Father collected huge stones in his room and barricaded himself against all comers, threatening to kill anyone who should try to enter' 91 . And it gets worse: 'Suicidal and homicidal manias are not unknown in the Society, but naturally the victims of these maladies are sent away, or put into mental homes. The praecox tendency showing itself in \"glorified egos\" is frequently encountered. Such Jesuits boast of their blue blood; of their prowess as teachers, orators, athletes, artists and theologians; or of the extraordinary amount of work they do. The Or der attributes their boastings to pride, and takes no cognisance of the activity of subcon scious complexes. There are many forms of cleptomania to be observed, from collecting knives, pins, books and golf balls to incontinently stealing tobacco and other things. One Jesuit... had as a \"fetish\", white linen. When he vacated his room, an enormous quantity of sheets, pillowcases, towels, and so forth were found accumulated under his bed and in cupboards. The \"fetish\" cult as practised in The Order usually takes on a pious form, namely the collection of objects of devotion' [which should of cour se be unnecessary, since the Lord is meant to be the sole object of devotion]. 'Sadism (the torturing of others) and masochism (self-torture) are apparently common in The Order. I have known some Jesuits to lash boys with hard leather straps in a state of passionate excite ment, while the boys writhed in agony, and blood flowed from their hands. These sadistic Jesuits, with flushed faces"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 387 and dilated pupils, seemed to glory in their orgy. As to masochism, I have seen Jesuits invite boys to throw hard balls at them with as much strength as they could; to hit them with sticks; to squeeze their fingers with wrenches until the blood almost oozed from under their fingernails; and to inflict other suchlike tortures upon them. Exhibitionism is, curiously enough, much in evidence in the Order. It may be that it proves to be the most natural reaction against the Rules of Modesty and similar forms of internal repression'. 'When, during vacation time, communities go to the seaside for a brief \"villa\", Jesuits are as unrestrained in their free-from- clothes sportings as i nhabitants of Central Africa. Exhibitionism is seen, too, in senseless feats of daring very common among Jesuits. Some ride down precipitous hills on bicycles devoid of brakes; some roll down the sides of steep heights blindfolded; some swim dangerous channels without an escorting boat. In these and other ways, they give expression to the violent reaction that the enforced restraint of their lives generates' 92 . Unsurprisingly, many Jesuits seize and cultivate opportunities to conduct long, unchaperoned visits to high-born women, a nd it is commonplace for 'sweet and agreeable words' to be exchanged 'that are tinged with carnal lust and carnal feelings' -which is hardly surprising, given the completely aberrant denial of normal human relationships, the central perverse mechanism of control, that prevails in all such societies of men whose human nature is denied in accordance with the control model derived from the pagan priesthoods of Rome and Greece. This regime establishes a masculine environment devoid of the loving intercession of females, the lack of whom fosters an essentially brutalised, harsh and ruthless mentality such as, for instance, gave rise to the Inquisition, and which may be found replicated in all systems using the Jesuit model. JESUITS WHO NEVER BATHE, AND JESUITS WHO ARE ALWAYS WASHING The expose continues: 'There are Jesuits who ne ver take baths, and Jesuits who are eternally washing their hands. There are Jesuits who paste paper over pictures in books that reveal the human figure, and Jesuits who collect pictures of pretty actresses. There are Jesuits who do everything in \"threes\", in devotion to the Trinity, and Jesuits who write all their notes on bits of torn paper out of love of \"Holy Poverty\". Finally, there are many Jesuits who crawl like worms, under the urge of inferiority complexes, and as many others who strut like peacocks, under the full blast of superiority complexes'. The analysis contains descriptions of the hypochondria which grips so many of these poor men: 'Some claim that their stomachs ar e so weak that they need an altogether special diet; some complain of a lack of vitality and are content to smoke and read the newspapers; indefinite and indescribable pains in the head or heart afflict others; fatigue in all its forms is rampant; and from every co mmunity there ascends to heaven an almighty wail of complaints. The only authorised psychotherapy afforded to these numerous victims of neuroses is an increase of pious endeavour , which, as might be expected, is as little efficacious against their mental sicknesses as it would be against gout or gangrene' 93 . Other references to rampan t homosexuality, suppressed or overt, and to the existence of pyromaniacs within The Order, abound. The descriptions, in the cited expose, of homosexual activities, cover the usual abuses, with boys spoken of as \"a suck of Father So-and-So\"; and further nasty detail would be superfluous.

The Jesuit Constitutions are trea ted as 'irrevocable' - just like certain provisions of the European Union's German DVD-derived Maastricht Treaty [see Chapter 8] - and Superiors refuse at all times to admit that they contain the slightest imperfections. All critical comments and judgments on them are attributed to 'bad faith and wickedness'. 'The sick man is hauled up for treatment as a result of denunciation; he is made use of by Superiors as a source of further inform ation; and he is treated as a child, as one incapable of judging things for himself. A \"cure\" is expected from this mixture of dialectics, insults, threats, piety, penances and dishonest statements of facts!' 94 . Most disconcertingly, the Jesuit has to accept whatever in sults are hurled at him in the 'true spirit of the Society', and not least because harsh and evil word s are typically couched in beautifully circumlocutory, elegant language and prose 94 . Particular venom is reserved for Jesuits wh o commit the sin of 'Disturbance of the Peace, and the Sowing of Discords and Quarrels '. Such people are called 'pests' and are informed that their disease en croaches upon the borders of grave sin. These Jesuits, and others considered 'guilty' of comparable 'sins', are required to be publicly reprimanded in the Refectory before the whole community. PERVASIVE REGIME OF JESUITICAL 'INF ORMANTS' IN THE UNITED STATES The treatment of renegade Jesuits procured via the pervasive system of oppressive espionage - which has spawned secular equivalents such as the East German system of informants, organised by the STASI operative Marcus Wolf, who arranged that an esti- mated one-third of the East German population were spying on the other two-thirds (and upon their fellows) - provides, as we have seen, the model for the abuses and organised denunciation fests perpetrated inter alia by the Communist Chinese during the Cultural Revolution (and almost certainly subsequently). It likewise provides the model for the repressive nationwide system of informants that is being erected 'as we speak' in the United States, partly on the basis of advice procured by the US Department of Homeland Security from its 'consultants', Marcus Wolf and Yevgeniy Primakov (Finkelstein), who shared partial cont rol of Soviet intelligence with his KGB boss, Mikhail Gorbachev, as late as 2005, according to special information passed to the Author 95 . Under this system, nothing that anyone says to a stranger in the United States will, before long, be 'privileged', unless the progressive slide towards the consummation of the Thousand-Year Reich on the ruins of the United States, predicted by the Nazi International in the early 1950s [s ee Chapter 8], is decisively arrested. It is also from the Jesuits' centuries-long 'expe rience' of 'treating' those of their members among whom their repressive regime has tr iggered psychological and psychosomatic disorders, that modern Satanic mind-control and personality-modification techniques such as those elaborated by the Tavistock Ins titute and its innumer able related 'offs hoots' and the Himmlerian scientists, are originally derived. In such 'treatment', 'the interest of the patient is quite obviously subordinated to that of The Order' 96 . The repressive regime of the Jesuits is so perverse that it has been known to turn men of the finest character into the meanest and most repulsive of creatures - a pro- gression which may help us to understand how certain rulers become devils.

The author of the expose referred in particular to an Irish Jesuit of his acquaintance whom he described as 'a clever young man full of ener gy and full of Irish fun and humour. He was a good classical scholar, particular ly accurate and exact in his scholarship; and gifted with a nice sense of literary style. He had, I think, the making of an exceptionally good critic, or writer of pungent and thoughtful essays. He might indeed have edited a paper with distinction, or have developed into a distinguished preacher or lecturer. He had great fluency, good judgment in the choice of words, and was possessed with a rich and sweet voice. He was endowed with all the qualities that one considers desirable in a teacher, and had it not been for the mental and moral blight that life in the Society meant for him, he might have become a brilliant Headmaster'. That was 35 or 40 years prior to the mid-1920s, when this expose was being written. That was 'then'. The same individual 'now' was de scribed by the author concerned, as 'one of the most despicable characters in existence. He is such a cr aven coward that he almost fears to cough, lest his coughing should be interpreted as a disregard of the Holy Rule. He has no friend whose secrets he is not on the alert to find out, in order to betray them at once to his Superior. There is no form of pretence, hypocrisy, equivocation that he is not versed in. There is no form of flattery in which he is not ready to indulge in order to please a Superior. There is no act of folly or imprudence of any member of his Province that he has not made himself thoroughly acquainted with, in order to have tales to tell to Superiors when names crop up at consultations'. After he had become a Superior, 'he was th e cruellest and most inconsiderate man I ever met. Many [members] of his Province lay to his charge the sad deaths of two young Scholastics' (as young Jesuits are known) 'who, though advanced tubercular cases, were driven to breaking-point by work that he imposed upon them. One of these tubercular Scholastics, whom I knew very well, was sent back by Fr. X to wade about in a half-frozen pond until he should find a skate that he had lost' (since all items in the Scholastics' possession belong to The Order, naturally). When the time of the Public Examinations arrived, Fr. X, who had kept this poor dying boy' (before the invention of appropriate drugs, of course) 'working at classics until 11 pm every night, allowed him to enter for the exams, although the doctor who had seen him the same day had said that there was no l onger any hope for his recovery and that at most he could last a few months. But Fr. X wanted' (for himself) 'the credit of the brilliant examination results that were expected of him. The results were forthcoming, but also the boy's death a few months later' 97 . The Jesuit Superior and 'Angel of Light' in question 'was preoccupied eternally with the reputation and good name of his company (house) and of himself: appearances were what he was interested in above all, while he was himself a despicable 'whited sepulchre' 98 . The author correctly compared this institutionalised hypocrisy and tyranny with the life and normal, human conduct of Jesus Christ; and in order to illustrate that this Author is far from being, of course, the only observer who has made this necessary comparison, the following passage will illustra te, finally, how far from Christ is this reprobate and odious man-made institution of oppression: 'One cannot of course conceive of any such reactions to repression as I have been describing, occurring in the entourage of Jesu s of Nazareth.

He had friends; \"a beloved disciple\", as well as Martha and Mary. He loved his City Jerusalem, and wept when he thought of its sorrows. No \"ne tangos\" (do not touch) rule prevented him from taking children into his arms. No regulations limiting his visits only to women of noble birt h' (as apply to Jesu its) 'kept him from visiting Peter's mother-in-law. When he wanted to talk to the Samaritan woman, he chose an hour when there would be none to overhear what He said. He was not preoccupied eternally with the reput ation and good name of his company'. 'There was no prudery about his manner of multiplying the wine at Cana's festive board, nor did he shirk hitting hard and angrily when the traders desecrated the Temple with trafficking. When lonely, he called his friends to keep him company. He made what provision he could for his Mother when he was dying, and he did not fear to look lovingly on her dear face.... He was essentially human, and the self-denial that he taught was not the constant goading to desperation of human fe elings and emotions, but the stamping out of that narrow, egotistical selfishness which stands in the way of loving one's neighbour' 99 . Note that 'the constant goading to despera tion of human feelings and emotions' 'just happens' to be the regimen demanding the suppression of human emotions required of the Masonic adept as outlined by the Illuminist Manly P. Hall. JESUITS SPAWNED ALL THE MODERN SATANIC DISEASES THAT PLAGUE US It is, indeed, by studying the Jesuit model that we can discern the germs of all the modern Satanic diseases with which civ ilisation today is afflicted, a nd which are addressed in this book. The institutionalised system of Jesuit espionage has spread throughout North America and the United Kingdom, certainly, so that all telephone calls and emails are liable to be listened to and monitored: indeed, since the mid-1980s, the Author has been aware of his telephone calls being intercepted, and in the case of transatlantic calls, it is frequently the case that when the army of perverse eavesdroppers ta kes exception to what is being said, they make their repulsive annoyances known by me ans of rude and unpleasant interjections, jamming or other electronic abuses. The ab omination of 'denunciations' was applied extensively in Communist China and other regimes erected by the Dark Forces of the Illuminati, and it features today in show-trials and in travesties of justice perpetrated in American courts, concerning certain instances of which this Author has extensive details. The obsession with the idolatry of brazen power* and, in order to gratify it, with controlling minds, altering personalities, and otherwise interfering with the human mind and body in order to maximise the presumed potential for manipulating populations, can be traced directly to comparable obsessions, at the micr o level, applied within the Jesuit houses. Other dubious methodologies developed by the Jesu its are in general use among intelligence communities worldwide, and throughout the European Union's structures. Because of their savage repression, espionage and exposure systems, the cardinal *The lust for power and control, of which such repressive espionage systems are a symptom, is the central driving force of the World Revolution. a.k.a. the 'New World' Order which the revolutionary United States was geomasonically established to implement. The 'seething energies' of Lucifer are relentless and ruthless, by definition knowing no rest - with the world now divided into two segments - recently referred to by a US military source [see box, page 313] as the 'Functioning Core' of countries which are fully signed- up to the 'New World' (a.k.a., the 'New Underworld') Order and the 'Non-Integrating Gap' of countries that are to be compelled to participate by all available means, however Satanic. For this purpose, space-based scalar technology, responsible for instance for the tsunami earthquake of 26th December 2004, and for other earthquakes and weather abnormalities, are being deployed, in an extremely dangerous series of confrontations by means of which competing elements of the global control nexus seek to impose their paradigms on non-cooperating or competing elements and governments. After each man-made catastrophe, advertisements and appeals appear in the newspapers and on US and British talk radio programmes, soliciting donations to assist the homeless and the bereaved - and the donations never arriv e at their supposed destination zones, because the funds have of course been scammed. There are no depths to which these organised Illuminati crook s will not sink - making money out of the kind-heartedness of people who feel disturbed that human beings on the other side of the world have bee n made destitute, being no exception. Indeed, the amounts of money that can be raised by such scams are inexhaustible, providing a sel f-contained motive for scalar and other catastrophe-generating operations."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 391 vice of the Jesuit is pretence and make-believe - unsurprisingly, also one of the most con- spicuous vices of the corrupt European Co mmission. Explosions occur as soon as, for instance, Jesuit Novices are released from their false, repressive, make-believe world, for a recreation period. The author of the expos e explained what happened on one occasion: 'At the instant that the warning bell announced the beginning of recreation, and permission to talk, there was a veritable ou tburst of cries and shouts. Noisy confusion sprang after the heels of holy silence, and de lirious uproar banged the door on demure gravity. As often as permission was given for games, and Novices played hockey, roughness and brutality was the spirit of the game. Cuts, blows and bruises were dis- tributed with the utmost liberality and the angelic faces of the Novices were not infre- quently distorted with immoderate emotions. When, however, the game was over, and the Novices, covered with mud and bathed in perspiration, bleeding, too, perhaps, and limping, thronged directly to the chapel (no time was allowed for change of clothes), peace and prayerfulness reappeared on their c ountenances, as if by magic. Repression was in the ascendancy once more' 100 . But since the cardinal vice of the Jesuit is pretence and double-minded make-believe, this rene wed appearance of piety was false. The Order - or this manifestation of it - specialises in the exploitation and elevation of piety as a control mechanism. It therefore perpetrates an abominable deception upon its originally naive recruits - a deception which they may waste their lives coming to terms with, and which dries up their faith and hope of salvat ion. In a Novice dormitory, the author of the expose heard one of his number, who had left a happy home and had appeared always to be 'very happy in his vocation', talk in his sleep. And what he mumbled in his sleep revealed the terrible prop ortions of the 'decision' he had taken, or had been compelled by peer or family pressures to take. In his sleep, 'suddenly he raised his voice and th ese words, laden with deep import, were carri ed up and down the dormitory, but probably no-one save myself was awake to hear them: \"Oh!\" he cried, \"Oh, if I only knew before I came'\". HYPOCRISY, FALSE MODESTY AND FARCE AT THE DINING TABLES An illustration of how the Jesuits exploit 'virtue' for dehumanising control purposes, causing confusion and deception to prevail among their acolytes, is provided by the fol- lowing observations of life at an Irish Jesuit House. At table, though perhaps ravenously hungry, the Novice has to eat with the utmost modesty. He may only place small morsels into his mouth at a time, even though always ha ving to 'eat against time', and has to take care at all times to mortify himself by denying th e nicest parts of what he gets to eat. He also has to attend to the spiritual reading that is going on, and to derive benefit from it. It is frowned upon to help oneself to anything before offering it to one's neighbour; and the Novice must be constantly on the lookout fo r any opportunity to satisfy his neighbour's needs before his own. Furthermore, any sign of desire for food or drink is liable to be interpreted, and most probably reported, as indicative of moral failure. Mealtimes are therefore especially tense, and provide ample opportunities for reporting backsliding to the authorities, or for being reported. Ordinary little courtesies become a veritable nightmare. Since one of the rules prescribes passing bread, salt and so forth without being asked to do so, so as to anticipate th e requirements of others, the Novice has to watch carefully so as to anticipate the requirements of those beside him. Bearing in mind that one's neighbours are doing the same thing, this leads to extraordinary tension as the Novices vie for the opportunity to pass the bread, salt, or whatever."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"392 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light From time to time, Jesuit houses have what are called 'wine-evenings', which are usually held after dinner in the Recreation Ro om. These may be liable to become more exuberant than intended. Anothe r practice is, or was, the pr ovision of beer at dinner. Everyone is allowed a glass of beer and if th is is desired, is required to push his glass towards the edge of the table, so that the No vice who has the duty for the evening of carrying the barrel of beer (as was the practice in the 1920s) around the dining room table, knows into which glasses the amber liquid should be pour ed. According to the author of the expose, it was, however, frowned upon ever to push one's glass towards the edge of the table, since to do so might be interpreted as a sign of self-indulgence. Accordingly, it rarely happened that glasses were pushed to the edge of the tabl e. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, it was routine for a Novice to enter the dining room carrying a barrel 'of beer' on his shoulder, ready to pour beer into appropriately positioned glasses as required. On one such occasion, a Novi ce, tired of being deprived for years of beer, after weeks of self-doubt, prayer, contemplation, self-examination and so forth, finally decided that he would push his glass to the edge of the table. He therefore arrived at the dinner table in a state of extreme anxiety, his heart beating at double the normal rate, and in a high sweat. When, finally, his nerve did not fail him, and he had summoned up the courage to push his glass to the edge of the table, a ghastly silence descended upon the room. He sensed that every eye was upon him, especially those of the Superior and his authorised spies. The Novice sat rigidly in his place waiting for the beer to be poured into his glass. When the beer-Novice du jour appro ached, the next disaster occurred. He walked straight past the glass that had been pushed to the edge of the table, to the amazed gaze of the Superior and the whole house. The Superior's sidekick promptly ordered him to make the circuit again and to pay attention to the glass that had been proffered. Then the third disaster occurr ed. The Novice carrying the cask 'of beer' lowered it to meet the proffered glass. But nothing came out. The cask 'of beer' was empty! In this manner was the charade of lies co ncerning beer expose d before the entire congregation. For years, it had been a rule that beer could be enjoyed at dinner. For years, Novices had taken it in turns to circumnavigate the dining table with the cask 'of beer'. And for years, the cask 'of beer' had contained no beer at all, to save money. To such mad and hypocritically ludicrous lengths do Jesuit houses go in order to prop up their lies and to sustain the false integrity of their pettily oppressive rules and tiny 'privileges' supposedly granted in alleviation of those rules. One interesting example of how Jesuits react to the meticulously pettifogging rules and regulations that they are required to follow, concerns so-called 'holy poverty'. This requirement is so oppressive that almost all Jesuits develop subterranean methods for securing pocket-money, even th ough, according to the author of the expose, 'they are forbidden to have money in their own or another's keeping' (so that they are effectively prisoners in and of their houses). Strictly a Jesuit should go to his Superior to ask for pocket money even to buy a newspaper or to pay a bus fare. In addition to developing devious means of circumnavigating the ru les of 'holy poverty', any breach of which is regarded as a grave violation of vows, Jesuits react to thes e rules by indulging in extreme wastefulness with community property. 'They break things, throw them around, misuse them with the utmost indifference. And when they receive permission to buy clothes or other items with community funds, they always choose the most costly'. There is an interesting parallel here with the behaviour of Bolshevik apparatchiks. Notoriously, they indulge themselves, maximising their exploitation of collective assets."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 393 OPUS DEI - THE NEW DIALECTICAL 'OPPOS ITE' WITHIN THE JESUITICAL ORBIT Today's world is chock full of organisations masquerading as though they are indispensable for the welfare of humanity - but which, upon closer examination, turn out to harbour chicanery or, at the very least, to be very far from what they seem. One such prominent organisation is the misleadingly named, but today extremely powerful, cult calling itself Opus Dei, which has attached itself, like so many other operations of the Illuminati, to the reprobate Catholic Church. This manifestation of the presence of 'Angels of Light' is clearly modelled according to the Jesuit blueprint, and appears to have achieved total ascendancy within the Vatican. It represents 'the Righf in contrast to the Jesuit 'Left'. In October 2003, Jose Maria (or Josemaria) Escriva de Balaguer, the founder of Opus Dei, who died in 1975, was 'canonised' at the Va tican - i.e., conferred with 'sainthood' - after one of the shortest waiting periods in the history of the Catholic Church. Although the New Testament teaches that all who believe that Je sus Christ is the Son of God are saints, the Catholic Church arrogates for itself the 'right' to confer sainthood. In other words, the label 'Saint' is conferred by man, not by God. Opus Dei (the 'Work of God') is supposed nowadays to have 85,000 adherents, and senior US intelligence officials cover their multiple sins by aspiring to membership of this peculiar 'right-wing' network. The organisation's many critics accuse Opus Dei of many cult-like practices, such as brainwashing adhe rents into slavish, repetitious devotion (not exclusively to Jesus Christ, of course), and blackmailing former members to prevent them from revealing the organisation's dark secrets. Sr Javier Sainz Moreno, who is a finance and tax lawyer at Madrid's Autonomous University, says that Opus Dei 'are a danger to society'. He claims that this organisation has enriched itself by means of a series of murk y transactions, which are easy for 'charitable' and 'religious' organisations to mask, since in most Western countries, they are immune from the disciplines applicable to ordinary businesses. Former Opus Dei alumni have reported that members in Opus Dei homes were required to report every element of their personal lives - who they met, whom they loved, what books they read -to 'spiritual directors', in the same way as Jesuits are re quired to spy on each other and to report on their fellow Jesuits' faults. Some Opus Dei members strapped their b odies with barbed wire and flagellated themselves with lead-tipped whips until they caused bleeding. One Spanish escapee told the Associated Press (3rd October 2002) that 'the first thing they do in the morning is to kiss the floor and say 'Serviam' ('I will serve', in La tin). It is a dangerous and destructive group that eradicates personality and freedom'. The question is: whom do these people serve? If they kiss the floor, they are bending downwards, which reveals those whom they re ally, albeit inadvertently in most cases, worship. Doubtless to the extreme displeasur e of both the Vatican and of Opus Dei's controllers, 'The Chicag o Tribune' performed an invaluable service on 7th December 2003 by publishing a detailed, though necessarily abbreviated, exposure of Opus Dei, which helps us to answer this question. Bear in mind that, as noted, senior US intelligence officials aspire and belong to this shadowy organisation - which may serve as a means of salving what remains of their consciences. It certainly provides them with a convenient 'God' label, or logo, that can be worn to mask their nefarious mindset and behaviour. The organisation was founded in 1928, three years after his ordination, by Escriva de Balaguer, after he had seen a vision in which, he claimed, God had revealed Opus Dei's mission. Those who reorder their lives on the basis of visions or 'voices' (like the"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"394 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light possessed occultist and 'New Age' exponent, Barb ara Marx Hubbard, for instance) need to be on guard that they have not, in fact, been accosted by a force other than that of an angel of God, as is usually the case. President George W. Bush's now notorious assertions that he was instructed by God to invade Afghanistan and then further instructed by God to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq - interventions which resulted in the murder of perhaps half a million people - are of course especially notorious such examples of people 'getting their gods muddled up'. In view of the fact that he is alleged to have been engaged in the past in occult practices, the President of the United States at the time th is book was being finalised may be possessed, or have a familiar spirit, who orders him to do this or that; for manifestly, God would never have issued such an instruction, as the Lord is not in favour of brutality, the use of fragmentation bombs against innocent civilians, the gross, barbaric abuse of prisoners in concentration camps, and all the other abominations perpetrated by the United States, and by Britain, led by its compromised and blackmailed Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in those two countries 101 . It is in any case known that the United States planned the attack on Afghanistan under President Clinton, and that plans for the Iraqi operation were at an advanced stage within days of President Bush Jr.'s first inauguration 102 [see Figure 94 on page 607]. President Bush's assertions that God told him to perpetrate these atrocities were thus demonstrably false, since the military-industrial complex had been planning these attacks for a long time previously. Membership of Opus Dei gives operatives like the disgraced FBI traitor, Robert Phillip Hanssen, a false 'Jesus comfort, or 'secu rity blanket', even as they allow their lives to be hijacked by yet another diversionary Lu ciferian deception - a ruse carrying the name of God, just as the Jesuits conduct their nefarious activities in Christ's name. (Hanssen's 'crimes' in passing secret intelligence to th e Russians were supposed to have been so heinous that he was condemned to spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement in Denver, and was described as the traitor who did more damage than anyone in US history. Yet he has allegedly been released, an d is living on the West Coast). In Spain, Opus Dei runs one of the countr y's two leading business schools, IESE, and also the University of Navarra, which Escriva founded in 1952. In the United States, where the movement is said to have some 3,000 members, it operates 'spiritual retreat' centres, a college and several schools, including the Midtown Educational Foundation located in Chicago. Its influence greatly exceeds the potential of its numbers. The membership of this Luci ferian Illuminist sect consists of three categories: • Numeraries, accounting for about 30% of members, who live in Opus Dei res- idences (men and women separately), are pledge d to celibacy, attend daily Mass and spiritual readings, and wear a sharp band of wire around their thigh for two hours each day, and whip themselves for minutes every week. Inflicti ng pain, whether on one's own body (which, as Jesus taught us, is 'the temple of the Holy Spir if) or on someone else's body, is Satanic, and cannot be justified in a True Chris tian context under any circumstances. • Supernumeraries, accounting for about 70% of the members, who can be married and live with their families, and who volun teer in Opus Dei centres and schools. • Cooperators: A third category consists of supporters of Opus Dei who make financial contributions but who are not memb ers. These people are called 'cooperators'. Opus Dei allegedly recently u nveiled a new 17-storey headquarters building in the heart of Manhattan, at 34th and Lexington, using a pl ot that was left vacant for many years - hardly indicative of a paucity of financial resources."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 395 ROSICRUCIAN OCCULT OPUS DEI Figure 62: A comparison of the symbols used by Opus Dei with key esoteric and Rosicrucian emblems: The following text appears beneath images A and B shown at the right, in 'Beyond the Threshhold: A Life in Opus Dei' by Maria del Carmen Tapia [Continuum, New York, 1999]: 'The Opus Dei Emblem: The cross in the circle of the world; the rose symbolizing Opus Dei women. The rose represents a gilded wooden rose that Monsignor Escriva found upon the ground near a destroyed church during the Spanish Civil War while fleeing the Republican military. M onsignor Escriva often said that it was a sign sent by the Virgin Mary that his escape was God's will'. Thus, despite her es cape from the clutches of Opus Dei, Maria del Carmen remained, as late as 1999, the victim of fables such as the one elaborated by her tyrannical former boss, Escriva. Mary is in no position to 'send signs' to anybody: she is the mother of Jesus and rests in peace in accordance with his Word. All worship of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven - which was specifically prohibited in Jeremiah, Chapter 44, as elements of the recalcitrant remnant of the people of Judah decided to return physically towards the Darkness (namely, Egypt) and spiritually (by the burning incense and the baking of cookies to the Queen of Heaven, a.k.a. Astarte, contrary to the Word of God repeatedly conveyed through Jeremiah) - is also condemned in Revelation as an abomination. Images C and D on the right reveal the real connotations of the two Opus Dei occult emblems, for which Maria del Carmen gives the wrong interpretations: G is the esoteric symbol for the Earth [Source: Dr Cathy Burns, in 'Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated', Sharing, PA., op. cit.,1998, page 396]. This symbol is displayed along with esoteric symbols for initia tion, false wisdom, cosmic con- sciousness, the Tree of Death, the Path of Universality, and multiple other diversionary 'New Age' sorcery symbols.

'Secret Societies', 1967, page 143]. Bees are a very ancient sorcery symbol; and the rose has the reverse of phallic connotations.

It is speculated that members of Opus Dei have reached the highest levels of the US Federal Government, including the Supreme Court and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, in particular, just as they have reached the highest levels of control in the Vatican. Opus Dei's policy is not to reveal who is or who is not a member. Contrary to Scripture, a pledge of secrecy, similar to the oppressive secrecy of the Jesuits, is written into the rules of Opus Dei; and indeed many Catholics themselves see Opus Dei as a conspiracy aimed at capturing the Catholic Ch urch from within, which has already happened at the highest levels. That idea is somewhat fanciful, since, as the late Malachi Martin and others have revealed, the 'Ancient Mysteries' have long since been allowed into the sanctuary, with the proliferatio n of Freemasonic membership and ritual among some of the hierarchy - contrary to Pope Leo XIII's rearguard Encyclical 'Humanum Genus' dated 20th April 1884, in which Freemasonry was roundly conde mned. Concerning the rules of secrecy and deceit which characterises Freemasonry, and which are replicated among the Jesuits, Opus Dei and within other manifestations of the hydra -like Order, that Pope (even though claiming to be Christ: see page 273) had this to say - revealing the Jesuitical imprint upon Masonry, and the methodology of all manifestations of The Order: 'Candidates are generally commanded to pr omise - nay, with a special oath, to swear - that they will never, to any person, at any time or in any way, make known the members, the passes, or the subjects discussed. ... Moreover, to be enrolled, it is necessary that the candidates promise and undertake to be thenceforward strictly obedient to their leaders and masters with the utmost submission an d fidelity, and to be in readiness to do their bidding upon the slightest expressi on of their will; or, if disobedient, to submit to the direst penalties and [even] to death itself. As a fa ct, if any are judged to have betrayed the doings of the sect or to have resisted commands given, punishment is inflicted on them not infrequently, and with so much aud acity and dexterity that the assassin very often escapes the detection and penalty of his crime'*. Many critics are disturbed because, as part of their 'devotional regimen', Opus Dei Numeraries inflict pain upon themselves. Supporte rs respond that mortification of the flesh is, according to the 'Chicago Tribune's' report, 'an ancient and honourable Christian practice that puts them in touch spiritually with the grea t saints of the past'. This is of course a grossly aberrant, Satanic teaching: not only is inflicting pain on one's body a ruse of the Evil One, but all attempts to 'connect' with the dead represent necromancy, which is a forbidden practice of the darkness, and an activity reminiscent of superstitions associated with the worst of pagan occult practices. Sharon Clasen, who these days lives in the suburbs of Wash ington DC, was intro- duced to Opus Dei as a Boston College 'freshman' (apparently, despite rampant 'political correctness' (mass mind-bending), it is still 'O kay' to refer to a female undergraduate as a 'freshman', even though female 'chairs' of US Congressional Committees are ludicrously referred to as 'Madame Chairperson' - Ed.) . The dormitories were full, so a friend recommended an off-campus women's residence called Bayridge, run by Opus Dei. She moved in, was initially attracted by the warm and supportive atmosphere, and eventually succumbed to the pressure to become a member.

Because everyone falls into that category, members are expected to sleep on the floor or on a board one night a week . The whip is called a 'discipline', the leg binding is a 'cilice'. Again, these aberrations ar e wholly contrary to Christian Truth, which provides that all that a sinner needs to do is to pray to the Lord for forgiveness and to repent. Nowhere in Scripture is it laid down that people are required, as a condition for forgiveness, to injure the temple of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, which is the human body. The whole formula is Satanic. Pope John Paul II gave the movement a unique status within the Catholic Church, by making it a 'personal prelature'. This exempts Opus Dei from the jurisdiction of local bishops, a privilege that Opus Dei had long campaigned for and which earlier Popes had resisted. In Chicago, the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin - whom the late Malachi Martin in person told your correspondent was a supremely evil man - gave Opus Dei clerics the control of a Chicago parish - St Mary of the Angels - on the Near Northwest Side, a privilege that Opus Dei enjoys in few other places. The movement's 'success' has provoked resentment and envy in certain other quarters of the Catholic Church locally. According to James Hitchcock, a history professor at St Louis University, a Jesuit school, 'in some cases, it's produced paranoia. There are Jesuits who hear you express conservative religious views, who say: \"Are you a covert member of Opus Dei?\"' The movement appeals, like so many others (Moral Re-Armament, for instance) to the idealism of youth. New recruits are told that they belong to the 'elite guard of God'. However when the scales eventually fall from th eir eyes, victims often report that they were isolated from their families, and that their reading matter was censored - even though Opus Dei officials deny using such coercion. Another Boston College Opus Dei recruit informed 'The Chicago Tribune' that a friend brought her to functions at an Opus De i house. 'What I didn't realise (at the time) was that I was a target for recruitment. When I joined, they said that you should have 10 to 15 friends that you're working on. You had to fill out forms each month and have meetings to develop strategies to get them to join' 103 . OPUS DEI EXPOSED BY THE BRAVE MARIA DEL CARMEN TAPIA The best-known defector from Opus Dei is Ma ria del Carmen Tapia, Escriva's personal secretary and a Regional Director of Opus Dei in South America (where the Grand Orient 'line' of Freemasonry is predominant to the point of virtually excluding the 'Anglo-Saxon' 'Scottish Rite' Tine'). Most Opus Dei members revere their founder. However, in her memoir, entitled 'Beyond the Threshhold: A Life in Opus Dei' 104 , Tapia recalls an Escriva who was not at all as imagined by his ferven t followers. On the contrary, 'the Founder', in her experience, was dictatorial, and threw temper tantrums. The 'Deus' that is invoked in the organisation's title is not, on the evidence of the very balanced and credible exposure published by 'The Chicago Tribune' alone, and on the basis of a considerable portfolio of other recently published materials, the Lord God of Israel, Jesus Christ the Lord. The most damning expose is Maria Carmen's own calm testimony. On the contrary, Opus Dei is yet another of the multiple deceptio ns and creations of the Evil One, a component of The Order, that we can read about in the Book of Revelation (Chapter 12, verse 9): 'And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world'. Therefore, the Deus of Opus Dei is in fact, of course, Lucifer. Its name should read: 'Opus Luciferis'."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"398 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light That this is the case, is definitively confir med by Maria del Carmen Tapia, who, though in love with a fiance perfectly suited to he r, made the fatal mistake of falling for the enticements of Opus Dei. Her unfortunate fiance told her sadly and pathetically, late in their relationship: 'If you were leaving me for another man, I would break his head, but what can I do to a God to whom I kneel every day?' This was a poignant example of how the Evil One 'deceives the whole world'. This young man faced the loss of his beautiful potential bride because both of them were under the illusion that the sacrif ice she was determined to ma ke was for God, whereas she was being entrapped and brainw ashed by the Great Deceiver. She spent years of her life coming to that realisation - although Cathol ics generally have a special problem on this score, because they remain entrapped within the cultural framework of their Church, which mastered the art of indoctrination millennia before any other organisation. Sects require total detachment from family a nd friends - a feature which is replicated within modern intelligence communities, memb ership of which precludes normal outside friendships, since any such relationships are disturbed by suspicions and loyalties to the intelligence community rather than to the friend. Corr espondence from the Opus Dei House to which Maria del Carmen was despatched was solely by letter, and all her letters were opened before leaving the premises, as was all inco ming correspondence. Other characteristics of life among these particular 'Angels of Light' summarised by the unfortunate Maria del Carmen Tapia included the supremacy of comm unal life, the absence of any free time, an excessive workload, daily meditation and mortifica tion, prohibition of all outside influences such as music, TV and film, radio, newspape rs and magazines, a requirement that Opus Dei and the Father - meaning Escriva, of course, not God - are always the primary topics of conversation, and the sole 'goals'; insistence that one's only family is Opus Dei; and a requireme nt to love the Father - Escriva, not God - more than one's own parents. This of course is a direct and blasphemous usurpation of the comparable teaching of Jesus Christ. In other words, Opus Dei, as described by Maria del Carmen Tapia, is one massive posthumous eg o trip for yet another disciple of Lucifer, another False Christ - the late Monsi gnor Jose Maria Escriva. She wrote: 'One facet of Opus Dei's brainwashing was to make its members believe that Opus Dei is perfect because it came from God and that every pronouncement of the Founder was by God's divine inspiration. This was emphasized from the start at the center of studies and in the courses of formation. As in a musical theme, the note was given by the first violin, Monsignor Escrivi; repeated immediately by the second violins, the Opus Dei Superiors; and followed by the string and percussion instruments, called fraternal chat, circles of study, days of recollection, spiritual retreats, fraternal corr ection, and so through all forms of indoctrination that Opus Dei has at its disposal. The indoctrination that we received did not allow us to reflect analytically on anything that we were unable to understand. Any critical thought was an indicati on of lack of unity and a lack of \"good spirit\", which we had to report in our weekly chat as a negative moment in our spiritual life' 105 . These restrictions and distortions of truth, of course, precisely mimic those applied for centuries by the Jesuits to sustain control over their dupes. A milder form of espionage than the oppres sive Jesuit system pr evails within the Opus Dei network, but the sect displays the same sexual obsessions as the Jesuits: for instance, no woman of any age in an Opus Dei residence may discuss spiritual matters with Opus Dei priests outside the Confessional. 'If, for any reason, a priest has to speak to a woman in a parlour, the door must remain wide open' 106 . Writing obviously from"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 399 the female perspective, Maria del Carmen described how young female Novices were trapped into giving up their sexuality, an d how they behaved in the context of the deviant teaching of Escriva concerning the de nial of such a crucial component of their humanity: 'Some (girls) who had joined O pus Dei at a very young age reacted to Monsignor Escriva's words often repeated in meditations: \"We have to love Jesus Christ with our heart of flesh\", unleashing their re pressed sexuality as they kissed the wooden cross in the oratory. That, in my judgm ent, was more dangerous than having had normal relationships with a young man' 107 . THE ANGEL OF LIGHT TRANSFOR MED INTO A RAGING DEMON The true nature of this tyrannical 'Angel of Light', Escriva, was perhaps most succinctly described by Maria del Carmen Tapia in the following dreadful narrative: 'I entered [the sessions room of the Cent ral Government]. Monsignor Escriva was standing and visibly irate, Father Javia Echeva rria and Father Francisco Vives were both on his left, both looking very stern. At the Fa ther's right was the Central Directress, Merceded Morado, the physician, Maria Jesus de Mer, and the Prefect of Studies, Marlies Kiicking. All of them looked furious. I felt terrified at th e scene. The interview went as follows: '\"These people have told me\", Monsigno r Escriva said, pointing his finger at the Central Directress and the other two advisors present, \"that you have received the news that you are not going back to Venezu ela with hysteria and tears\". Beside himself, he shouted at me: \"Very bad spirit! You are not going back to Venezuela, because your work has been individualistic and bad! And you have murmured against my documents! Against my documents, you have murmured!\"' 'His anger affected his breathing, and he held his clenched fist close to my face. \"This is serious! Serious! Serious! I admonish you ca nonically. Let it be so recorded\", he said, directing his words towards Javier Echevarria, who, I insist, had no position whatsoever in the women's Central Government. \"The next time\", continued Monsignor Escriva, \"you are out! Always complications since 1948! Y ou and that other one! Now you come to me with this! And don't cry, because your trou ble is that you are proud, proud, proud...\". Repeating these words, he went through the chalice room, towards the major sacristy. I stood frozen. I did not budge. The Central Directress said angrily: 'What unpl easantness you are causing the Father!'\" However Maria del Carmen had evidently still not then understood that the best thing that could possibly have happened to he r would have been to have been dismissed from Opus Dei then and there - a denouement which was to await her later. But before her final release, she went through several manifestations of absolute hell. For instance, between November 1965 and March 1966, T was held completely deprived of any outside contact, with the absolute prohibition to go out for any reason or to receive or make telephone calls, or to write or receive letters. Nor could I go out for the so-called weekly walk or the monthly excursion. I was a prisoner' 108 . The manner in which lies hide within lies in this mad world of Illuminati-linked sects masquerading as God's work was illustrated by Maria del Carmen when describing an occasion on which an enormous graven image of the Virgin Mary (a.k.a. the Queen of Heaven, proscribed in Jeremiah 109 ) was scheduled to be blessed by Pope Paul VI: 'When we arrived at the chapel (in Rome), the huge marble statue of the Virgin occupied the middle of the nave. The Father arrived giving orders to the men about the"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"400 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light placement of the Virgin or some such thing. The servants had learned that \"for once\" they had to applaud the Pope more than the Father (Escriva). The majority of the women who were going to communion wore white veils and were in the central nave. The Mass moved me deeply. Paul VI lauded Opus Dei and mentioned in the homily that he had worked in the neighbourhood as a priest. When he said that one of the tilings he praised most highly within Opus Dei was the \"spirit of freedom\", I rebelled and wanted to shout out loud: \"Lies, Holy Father, lies!\" I realized that the world press was there and that my shout in Italian would embarrass Opus Dei but felt that in the final analysis it would embarrass the Church. Although I tried not to cry, I wept uncontrollably, my Catholic loyalty being stronger than the oppression of my soul. I could not help but reflect bitterly, however, on the distorted information that the Work's Superiors must have given to the Holy Father' 110 . When the Lord made it clear that the whole world shall be deceived 111 , he included the Pope, one of the arch-deceivers, as well. For those who live lies both recognise, and are deceived by, the lies of others. Maria del Carmen was later subjected to a series of quite appalling interrogations. 'When I returned to my room after each inte rrogation, I observed that things kept dis- appearing. My overnight bag, my academic records, family pictures, addresses, and family dates. They went through everything. I found the closet in disorder, the bed, my pyjamas, even my toiletries such as face cream and toothpaste.... Fu rthermore, the tele- phone. .. was permanently watched by a member of the administration's local council. They did not allow me to do anything in the house, not even cleaning, or going to the dining room. I was confined to my bedroom. They brought me up a tray with my meals. I was completely sealed in.... I began to shake al most constantly as a result of my terror. I was afraid they would take me to a mental institution, as I knew they had done to other members of the Work'. Finally, Maria del Carm en was verbally abused again directly by the Angel of Light, Father Escriva, who invented a jumble of obscene lies which he proceeded to deliver in a torrent of rage out of his evil mouth. As he dismissed her from Opus Dei, he exploded: '\"Don't talk with anybody about the Work nor about Rome. Don't set your parents against us, because, if I find out that you are saying anything negative about the Work to anybody, I, Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer, have the world press in my hands\", and as he said this, he made a gesture with his hands confirming the notion. \"I will publicly dishonour you. Your name will appear on the front page of every newspaper, because I will personally see to it. It would bring dishonour on you before men and on your own family! Woe to you if you try to alienate your family from the good name of the Work or tell them anything about this!\" He went on: \"And don't return to Venezuela! Don't even think of writing to anybody there! Because if you even think of going to Venezuela' (where Maria del Carmen Tapio would be in a position to reveal the true nature of Opus Luciferis), T will assume the responsibility of telling the Cardinal what you are. And it would dishonour you!\" Pacing the room, this 'man of God', this 'Angel of Light' continued, 'shouting at me: \"I was thinking all night about whether to tell you this or not, but I believe it is better that I should tell you'\". 'Looking at me directly, with a dreadful rage, moving his arms towards me as if he was going to hit me, he added at the top of his voice: \"You are a wicked woman! A lost woman! Mary Magdalen was a sinner, but you? You are a seductress with all your immorality and indecency! You are a seductress. I know everything. EVERYTHING! EVEN ABOUT THE VENEZUELAN NEGRO!

And don't ask for my blessing because I don't intend to give it to you!'\". Monsignor Escriva, the 'man of God', that 'Angel of Light', went away towards the (pagan) Relics Chapel. From there he turned round to shout a final insult: \"Hear me well! WHORE! SOW!'\" It was, of course, at that instant, that the scales fell from the eyes of the 'Father's' former secretary, Maria del Carmen Tapia: 'I stood stock still, frozen to the spot. I saw and heard everything as if in a nightmare. I did not cry. I did not blink. Within me, while Monsignor Escriva shouted his insults, I had only two thoughts: one that Christ remained silent in the face of accusations ; the other, that God had liberated me' 112 . OTHER NAZI 'ANGELS OF LIGHT' MASQUERADING UNDER THE 'JESUS LOGO' Spreading out, this Author believes, from the precedents long since established by the Jesuits, and much later by Opus Dei, of exploiting the name of Jesus and/or God as a subtle nameplate, logo and cover for nefarious operations, other 'Angels of Light' have borrowed this idea - especially in the United States. Bene ath the label of 'Jesus', Dark Actors can Play Games and conduct their evil activities while de luding themselves and others that they are actually doing good. In other words, Satan delivers a double-whammy by means of this deception device: first, the 'Jesus' or 'God' label or logo puts almost all observers off the scent, leaving private analysts such as the author of the 'Chicago Tribune' report, and this Author and his collaborators, to lift the veil from the deception, revealing the dark chaos inside the 'whited sepulchre' 113 exposed; and secondly, the Dark Actors adopting these labels are self-deluded into believing that their nefarious activities are hidden from view and exempt from eventual divine retribution. Those concerned may actually believe that God, in whom they profess, for public consumption at any rate, to believe, cannot see what they are up to 14 , or else turns a blind eye to their evil acts, thanks to the 'cover' provided by the label reading 'Jesus' or 'God'. The US intelligence analyst Wayne Mads en, though waging dial ectical political warfare, has recently thrown important light on this further dimension of the 'Angels of Lighf phenomenon. In a report disseminated electronically in October 2005, he assembled evidence to demonstrate the existence of an organised US network of evildoers who, both individually and collectively, use 'Jesus' as cover for their scams and Luciferian activities. This research has exposed in particular the expl oitation of the false 'Jesus' label as camouflage for Nazi-type attitudes and behaviour, as well as for organised criminal operations. Because the importance of the resulting insights can hardly be underestimated, this Author takes the liberty of appending herewith several pertin ent paragraphs from Mr Madsen's exhaustive report (which goes into rather more detail than is necessary for the present analysis). It identifies the existence of a dubious network calling itself Th e Fellowship, or The Family, and it identifies a central headquarters for this operation based, inevitably, in Arlington, Virginia, the central location of the US intelligence community. Both the network and the property in question, called The Cedars, are clearly operations of a branch of the vast US intelligence sector, which is more than cynical enough to seek to co- opt the name of Jesus for nefarious purposes. Specifically, Mr Madsen, whose work is considered generally to be of a high qual ity, even though it is 'inspired', explained:"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"402 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light 'After several months of in-depth research and, at first, seemingly unrelated con- versations with former high-level intelligence officials, lawyers, politicians, religious figures, other investigative journalists, and researcher s, I can now report on a criminal conspiracy so vast and monstrous that it defies imaginat ion. Using \"Christian\" groups as tax-exempt and cleverly camouflaged covers, wealthy ri ght-wing businessmen and \"clergy\" have now assumed firm control over the biggest prize of all - the Government of the United States of America. But first, some housekeeping is in orde r. My use of the term \"Christian\" is merely to identify clearly the criminal conspirators who have chosen to misuse their self-avowed devotion to Jesus Christ in order to advance a very unchristian agenda. The term \"Christian mafia'\" [a contradiction in terms, of course - Ed] 'is what several Washington politicians have used to describe the major conspirators, and it is not intended to debase Christians or infer that they are criminals. I will also use the term Nazi - not for shock value - but to tag properly the political affiliations of the early founders of the so-called \"Christian\" power cult, which is called The Fellowship. The most important element of this story is that a destructive religious movement has now achieved almost total control over the machinery of government of the United States - its Executive Branch, its Legislature, several State Governments, and soon, the Federal Judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court'. THE FELLOWSHIP' OR THE FAMILY' - A 'CHRISTIANAZI' ORGANISATION 'The United States has experienced religious and cult hucksters throughout its history, from Cotton Mather and his Salem witch-burn ers, to Billy Sunday, Father Charles Coughlin, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite, and others. But none have ever achieved the kind of po wer now possessed by a powerful and secretive group of conservative politicia ns and wealthy businessmen in the United States and abroad, who are known among their adhe rents and friends as The Fellowship, or The Family. The Fellowship and its predecessor organization s have used Jesus in the same way that McDonald's uses golden arches [M - the occultic 13th letter of the alphabet -Ed] and Coca Cola uses its stylized script lettering. Jesus is a logo and a slogan for The Fellowship. Jesus is used to justify The Fellows hip's access to the highest levels of government and business, in the same way that Santa Claus' [Satan Cl aws - Ed.] 'entices children into department stores and malls during th e Christmas shopping season'. \"The Fellowship', Wayne Madsen has estab lished, 'has been around under various names since 1935' - that is to say, since the consolidation of Nazi (occult, Illuminati) power in Germany, a factor that gives us a clue as to the pertinence of Mr Madsen's findings. 'Its stealth existence has been perpet uated by its organization into small cells, a pyramid organization of \"correspondents\", \"asso ciates\", \"friends\", \"members\", and \"core members\", tax-exempt status for its foundations, and its protection by the highest echelons of our own Government and those abroad'. The roots of this network calling itself The Fellowship, Madsen has established, 'go back to the 1930s and to a Norwegian immigrant and Jewish Methodist Minister named Abraham Vereide. According to Fellowship archives maintained at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois' [Bill y Graham being a 33rd Degree Freemason -Ed], Vereide, who immigrated to the United States from Norway in 1905, began an 'outreach ministry' in Seattle in April 1935. But his religious outreach involved nothing more than pushing for an anti-Communist, anti-trade uni on, anti-Socialist, and pro-Nazi German political agenda. A loose organization a nd secrecy were paramount for Vereide."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 403 Fellowship archives state that Vereide wanted his movement to \"carry out its objective through personal, trusting, informal, unpublicized contact between people\". Vereide's establishment of his Prayer Breakfast Movement for anti-Socialist and anti-International Workers of the World (IWW or \"Wobblies\") [targeting] Seattle businessmen in 1935, coincided with the establishment of another pro-Nazi German organization in the United States, the German-American Bund. Vereide saw his prayer movement replacing labor unions'. This operation had all the hallmarks of a German Abwehr (secret Nazi Intelligence) influence-building offensive, which is exactly what it was, and is. 'As a student of the un-Christian' [sic!] 'German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, Vereide's thoughts about a unitary religion based upon an unyield ing subservience to a composite notion of \"Jesus\", put him into the same category as many of the German nationalist philosophers who were favoured by Hitler and the Nazis. Nietzsche wrote the following of Christianity: \"When we hear th e ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves: Is it really possible! Th is, for a Jew, crucified two thousand years ago, who said he was God's son? The proof of such a claim is lacking'\". 'One philosophical fellow-traveller of Vereide was the German Nazi philosopher Martin Heidegger, a colleague of Leo Strauss, the father of American neo-conservatism and the mentor of such present-day American neo-conservatives as Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. Strauss's close association with Heidegger and the Nazi idea of telling the big lie in order to justify end-goals - Machiavellianis m on steroids - did not help Strauss in Nazi Germany. Because he was Jewish, he was forced to emigrate to the United States, where he eventually began teaching neo-conservative political science at the University of Chicago. It is this confluence of right-wing philosophies that provides a political bridge between [so-called] modern-day Christian Rightists (including so-called Christian Zionists, a wing of The Fellowship, based in Arlington, Virginia) and the secular-oriented neo-conservatives who support a policy that sees a US-Israeli alliance against Islam and European-oriented democratic socialism'. 'For the dominion theologists, the United St ates is the new Israel, with a God-given mandate to establish dominion over the entir e planet. Neither the secular neo-conser- vatives nor the Christian funda mentalists seem to have a problem with the idea of American domination of the plan et, as witnessed by the pres ence of representatives of both camps as supporters of the neo-conservative Project for a New American Century, the neo- conservative blueprint for America's attack on Iraq and plans to attack, occupy, and dominate other countries that oppose US designs'. Here, Wayne Madsen has alluded, perhaps unw ittingly, to the central finding of this book - namely, that German secret intelligence has leveraged the occult heritage of Bavaria and Prussia, and its hijacking of the Illuminati, in pursuit of Germany's own secret global hegemony objectives, exploiti ng America's 'destiny' as the enforcement arm of the Illuminati. Global hegemony is the primary motivation behind all German covert operations - including its hyperactiv ism in respect of occult initiatives. From the perspective of German secret intelligence, 'Jesus' can be used (as under Hitler) as justification for deployment of the 'iron fist' and the perpetration of atrocities. Discarding all the cloaks behind which the offensive against mankind is being waged, we find two primary conspirators: German Nazis and the Jewish Zionists, both of which powers 'agree' and are of one mind - so much so that the Zionists were content for Hitler's Black Illuminati regime to sacr ifice millions of Jews for geostrategic objectives. After all, both parties are united in their visceral hatred of Jesus Christ."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"404 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light Thus Eichmann, a Jew, was engaged in organising the transportation of Sephardic Jews to Palestine, in an ethnic cleansing operati on designed along eugenical lines to ensure the 'purity' of the gene quality of the population of the intended State of Israel. Since Zionism and Nazism 'agree', and given the Zeitgeist of the period, we need not be surprised at the double-mindedness of Jewish Illuminists who were in fact playing with fire by collaborating with the millennial 'Gentile' Forces of Dark ness emanating from the Black Forest and from the bleak plains and dark woods of Northern Germany. According to Madsen, 'what bound all so-called \"America First\" Movements prior to World War II was their common hatred for labor unions, Communists and Socialists, Jews, and most definitely, the administration of Pres ident Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Vereide's Prayer Breakfast Movement, pro-Nazi German groups like the Bund, and a resurgent Ku Klux Klan (KKK), had more than propaganda in common: they had an interlocking leadership and a coordinated political agenda'. 'Not only was Vereide pro-Hitler, he was the only Norwegian of note, who was not officially a Nazi, who never condemned th e Norwegian Nazi leader Vidkun Quisling a man whose name has become synonymous with the word traitor and who was executed in 1945. Vereide and Quisling were almost the same age; Vereide was born in 1886, Quisling in 1887. They both shared a link with the clergy, Vereide was a Methodist Minister and Quisling was the son of a Lutheran Minister' - further instances of Dark For ces emerging from ecclesiastical quarters. MORAL RE-ARMAMENT LEADER THANKED HEAVEN FOR ADOLF HITLER 'Another pro-Nazi 'Christian' fundamentalist group that arose in the pre-Second World War years was the Moral Re-armament Movement (MRA). Its leader was Frank Buchman, a Lutheran minister from Philadelphia. Buchman w as a pacifist, but not just any pacifist. He and his colleagues in the United States, Brit ain, Norway, and South Africa reasoned that war could be avoided if the world would just accept the rise of Hitler and National Socialism, and concentrate on stamping out Communism and Socialism. Buchman coordinated his activities with Vereide and his Prayer Breakfast Movement, which, by 1940, had spread its anti-left manifesto and agenda throughout the Pacific Northwesf. Buchman seems to have had no understanding of the dialectic. 'Buchman was effusive in his praise for Hitler. He was quoted by William A. H. Birnie of The New York World Telegram', as having stated: \"I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism\" 115 . Frank Buchman also secretly met with Heinrich Himmler, the head of the Gestapo and controller of the concentration camps. Buchman was at Himmler's side at the 1935 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg and again at th e 1936 Berlin Olympics. The predecessor of Buchman's Moral Re-armament Group, the Oxford Group, included Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus. Buchman and Hitler both saw the creation of a one-world religion based largely on Teutonic, Aryan, and other pagan traditio ns mixed with elements of Christianity 116 . Buchman saw Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism as being compatible with his brand of Christianity' [a total aberrati on, of course, since no 'religion' is compatible with True Christianity, including modern Judaism: such notions are routinely generated by individuals and intelligence operatives who are knowingly ignorant of Scripture and who refrain from reading it, since they sense that if they were to do so, they would be compelled to abandon their fanciful inventions - Ed.]. 'Hitler, too, had an affectation for Islam and Buddhism, as witnessed by his support for the"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 405 Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the anti-British Muslim Brotherhood, and Tibetan Buddhists. But Frank Buchman had no sympathy at all for the Jews whom Hitler was persecuting. Thus Buchman told Mr Birnie: \"Of course, I d on't condone everything the Nazis do. Anti- Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitle r sees a Karl Marx in every Jew'\". Such global ecumenicalism is a founding principle for today's Fellowship. With total devotion to 'Jesus' but not necessarily [to put it mildly - Ed.] to His principles at its core, The Fellowship continues to reach out to Moslems (including to Saudi extreme Wahhabi sect members), Buddhists, and Hindus. Its purpose has little to do with religion but everything to do with political and economic influence-peddling and the reconstruction of the world in preparation for a thousand-year Christian global dominion'. In the light of this book's principal finding, this Author must elaborate Wayne Madsen's insight here, so that it reads The Thousand-Year Reich', as proclaimed by the 'Madrid Circular Letter' distributed by the Nazi International from Madrid, and intercepted by the Allies, as explained in Chapter 8: and this connection is indeed made by the Author in what follows. Christianity? Forgeddaboudit. This is an operation of secret German Black intelligen ce; and self-interested US participants in The Fellowship, which is controlled by the German (Nazi) cadre of the US intelligence community, need to wake up from their comfortable, complacent slumber before it is too late. They are dupes, 'Useful Idiots', exploitees in the hands of the Nazi International Continuum. As Mr Madsen further explains, an ideology has been constructed around the 'Jesus' logo by these 'Angels of Light'. 'Post-millennialist Fellowship members believe that Jesus will not return until there is a 1,000-year ' pure' Christian Government established upon Earth. It is this mindset that has infused the [naive] foreign policy of George W. Bush and his Administration. The desire for a thousand-year political dominion of the world is not new. Hitler planned for a \"Thousand-Year Reich\", over the planet. It is not a coincidence that Hitler desired, and the so-called Christ ian Dominionists/recon-structionists now contemplate, a thousand-year reign. The Christian Dominionists are Figure 63: The reprobate allegedly false priest, Dr Robert H.

All of which is indisputable, and Mr Madsen has performed a unique service in bringing this material so succi nctly together in one place; but this Author adds that these people are not so much 'heirs' to the Nazis, as part of the Nazi International Continuum, which is directed clandestinely from Dachau: see Chapter 8. The 'Angel of Lighf Escriva is now effectively ensconsed on the so-called 'Throne of St Peter', assisted by his Opus Dei aide, Georg Ganswein. The Estermann murders were associated with an operation directed by the secret German Nazi Internationa] 'Black' intelligence service, hiding behind its handy STASI label, to penetrate and co-opt the Vatican's Swiss Guard corps for Opus Dei/Lu ciferis. Funds misdirected and scam-med from the giga-financing operation presided over by George H W Bush in 1989-92 were paid over inter alia to Opus Dei, in accordance with Illu minati priorities. 'Vereide and Buchman had important allie s on Wall Street', Madsen elaborated. 'According to Marine Corps General Smedley Butler, shortly after Franklin Roosevelt was elected President in 1932, he was appro ached by a group of wealthy Republican industrialists to lead an anti-Roosevelt Fascist coup against the Government. As with today's Fellowship, Vereide and Buchman were merely front men for anti-Socialist big businesses who hid behind the facade of a Christian 'evangelical' movement'. 'The coup was to be financed mostly by the J. P. Morgan and Du Pont financial empires. General Butler, who had no time for th ese industrialists since his military forays into Central America and the Caribbean as a foot-soldier on behalf of wealthy capitalists, rejected their overtures. Gerald MacGuire , a Wall Street bond salesman and former Commander of the Connecticut American Legion, was the chief recruiter for the coup plot. Butler informed Congress of the plans fo r the putsch. However, Congress was owned by Wall Street, and no charges were ever brought against the plotters. Butler was incensed and went public; but he was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist [the usual resort of those who persist in sitting on their brains - Ed.] . Not until 1967, when journalist John Spivak uncovered a secret Congressional report, was Butler's version of the events validated. In the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Nazi Propaganda Activities in the United States, Representative Samuel Dickstein (D-NY) conc luded that there was evidence of a coup plot by the right-wing against Roosevelt. However, much to Butler's chagrin, no criminal action was taken against the plotters'. 'Butler said MacGuire's plan was for Butle r to force Roosevelt to declare he had become too sick from polio, and to create a powerful new Cabinet position, the Secretary of General Affairs, to run the Government on his behalf. The New Deal, which the US Fascists and Nazis referred to as the \"Jew Deal\", would have to be scrapped. A com- parison between the Secretary of General Affairs and the present Secretary of Homeland Security is striking. If Roosevelt did not agree to the coup plotters' demand, half a million American Legion veterans would march on Washington to remove Roosevelt physically from office. But MacGuire decided that a perception management campaign [Psy-Ops - Ed.] would work, and that an armed force would not be required. He told Butler: \"You know, the American people will swallow that. We have got the newspapers. We will start a campaign [to the effect] that the President's health is failing. Everyone can tell that just by looking at him, and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second...\". Shortly after his testimony before the House Investigation Committee, Gerald MacGuire died of 'pneumonia' at the age of thirty-seven'."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 407 THE CULTURE OF COUPS AND PLOTS - IMPORTED FROM GERMANY 'The perception management [Psy-Ops] campaign to foster the attempted right-wing coup against FDR was a harbinger of more ruses and lies that were to emerge from the same 'right-wing' elements in the United States: that the first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal was suffering from mental illness when he threw himself out of the sixteenth storey of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1949; that John F. Kennedy was killed by a lone, pro-Communist assassin; and that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction' [Author: It did, but the GRU removed them]. The coup plotters involved some of the biggest names in American business and politics, including Irenee Du Pont, of the wealthy chemical company family' (which has been reported to believe that it is descended from Pontius Pilate) 'and the founder of the pro-Fascist Amer ican Liberty League; the J. P. Morgan bank officials, Grayson Murphy and John Davis; General Douglas MacArthur; the old southern segregationist Governor Eugene Talmadge, of Georgia; and, in what represented a sea- change for the extreme American right-wing, two influential Catholics, the former Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith, who had become very anti-Roosevelt, and John Raskob, a senior Du Pont official and a high-ranking member of the Catholic Knights of Malta' who are always involved in these conspiracies. 'The concordat between right-wing Protestants and Catholics presaged the later alliance between The Fellowship and the proto- Fascist Opus Dei movement'. 'Frank Buchman, who was also involved in creating the psychologically abusive Alcoholics Anonymous (which enticed many converts from booze to \"Jesus\", which was the course pursued by George W. Bush Jr., thr ough Billy Graham), created an organization called First Century Christian Fellowship. In 1939, while preaching against life's extravagances, Buchman set up his headquarters in New York's extremely posh Waldorf-Astoria Hotel' (a place where, if one gives the cloakroom lady less than a $10 tip in exchange for handing over your coat, she holds out her hand and grimaces at it as though it was something unpleasant - Ed.). 'Buchman also found common cause with right-wing racist gr oups. In addition to his anti-Semitism, Buchman had no time at all for the civil rights movement. Like Vereide, he rejected women's suffrage and the trade unions. When the United States entered the war in December 1941, many of Moral Re-armament's leaders sought conscientious objector status in the draf t, as \"lay evangelists\". As with today's fundamentalist Christians, Buchman was rejected by his fello w evangelicals and by mainstream religious leaders, including his old evangelical colleague Sam Shoemaker and Dr. Franklin Clark Fry, the leader of the United Lutheran Ch urch in America, who called Mr Buchman's connection with Lutheranism \"minimal\". Af ter Senator Harry S. Truman received the 1944 nomination for Vice President, he, too, dropped his past tenuous connections to Buchman. Reinhold Niebuhr, the famous theologian, and George Orwell, both labelled Buchman's Oxford Group and his successor Moral Re-armament Movement, as \"Fascist'\". They specialised in 'mind games'. 'Meanwhile, Frank Buchman's co-ideologist, Vereid e, made his first entree into the U.S. Congress. In 1942', Wayne Madsen recounts, 'he began to hold small and discreet prayer breakfasts for the U.S. House of Representative s. The next year, the Senate began holding Prayer Breakfast Meetings. Vereide's Pr ayer Breakfast Move ment was formally incorporated as the National Committee for Christian Leadership (NCCL). Its headquarters were established in Chicago. In 1944, while Vereide's friends in Germany were being pummelled by the Allies, especially by the Soviet Red Army, NCCL changed its name to International Christian Leadership (ICL) - an indicati on that Vereide saw"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"408 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light an immediate need to extend his influence abroad in the context of a certain Nazi defeat'. Given what we know about the operations of the Nazi International from 1942 onwards [see Chapter 8], the fact that Vereide's altered tactics coincided with the changed tactics and strategies of the Madrid-based German Geopolitical Centre, is significant. Vereide also made plans to move his headquarters to Washington, DC 'In 1944, his first ICL Fellowship House was established in a private house at 6523 Massachusetts Avenue. In 1945, Vereide held his first joint Senate-House Prayer Breakfast Meeting. In 1945, Vereide quickly put together a group of powerful right-wingers for a prayer breakfast following the death of President Roosevelt, one of the US politicians that Vereide and Buchman had despised most. Roosevelt had not been a President who followed the dictates of \"God's Will,\" a key Vereide and Buchman principle. At the breakfast were Senators H. Alexander Smith (R-NJ), Lister Hill (D-AL), and the World Report publisher David Lawrence. Lawrence was an arde nt foe of the New Deal'. Madsen's analysis continued with details about the 'movement's' intrigues to procure hegemony within American official and politic al structures, to match the dominant position that was in the process of being established collectively by Nazi operatives and Himmlerian occultic scientists within the Central Inte lligence Agency and in the universities. His analysis provided detailed corroboration of the pledges, contained in the 'Madrid Circular Letter' discussed in Chapter 8, that for the Nazi International, 'the war never ended' - and that the German secret globalists remained unswerving in their intention to establish the Thousand-Year Reich - namely, a millennium of GERMAN hegemony - upon the ruins of the United States. That remains the objective and focu s of the Nazi Internat ional Continuum and of its secret 'Black' intelligence services, to this day. Wayne Madsen's analysis is relentless in its exposure of the Nazi Continuum hiding behind its false 'Christian' facade: 'After the war, Vereide took steps to consolidate right- wing groups in Europe. His hated Communists and Socialists had taken over governments across Eastern Europe, and were on the verge of achieving power in Western Europe. Winston Churchill had been swept from powe r by a very leftist-oriented Labour Government headed by Clement Atlee. For the remnants of the Nazi movement in America, an \"SOS\" was being transmitted from Europe fo r assistance. Vereide travelled to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, France and Germany. His ICL made an alliance with the like-minded British Victory Fellowship in Great Britain. He also struck up a close relationship with the German Lutheran pastor Gustav Adolf Gedat. The German clergyman had been a leading anti-Semite before and during the war. In the same year that Vereide began his prayer breakfasts in Sea ttle, Gedat thundered from the pulpit that \"God ordered the Germans to hunt down Jews'\" - the 'god' in question bearing an uncanny resemblance, no doubt, to George W. Bush Jr's 'familiar'. 'Gedat became an apologist for top Nazi offi cials. But at the same time, he covered his tracks by actively disowning Nazi war criminals, such as th e former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, a personal friend of the current Republican Governor of California and fellow Austrian, Arnold Schwarzenegger. It should be noted that Schwarzenegger's father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, was a volunteer in the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA), a.k.a. the Brown Shirts, in Austria, and served in the German Army'. As a member of the West German Bundestag, Gedat brought about the cancellation at the Cannes Film Festival of the showing of a film concerning a family of Jewish refugees from Prague during the Nazi regime. 'At the same time', Wayne Madsen reported, 'Gedat was one of three of Mr Vereide's International Council for Christian Leadership"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 409 (ICCL) representatives in Europe. The other two were also Nazis - Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (who is married to Queen Juliana), and the German Prince, Max von Hohenlohe. This man' - from a prominent IUuminati family - 'served under SS chief Walter Schellenberg and, according to SS documents captured by the Soviets, Hohenlohe engaged in direct negotiations during the war with [the Abwehr agent] Allen Dulles of the OSS. Like Vereide and Buchman, Allen Dulles was a strong anti-Semite who saw Communism and Jews through the same lens'. Through the \"Rat Line\" programme operated by the OSS, then the CIA and the Vatican, such infamous Nazis as Klaus Barbie (the 'Butcher of Lyon'), the Nazi 'mad scientisf and butcher Dr. Joseph Me ngele' (who remained active and served US intelligence for decades), 'the concentration camp vaccine 'tester' Kurt Blome, and SS Commander Adolf Eichmann, escaped from Europe to South America with the assistance of 'Angel of Light' collaborators in the Vatican. During January 1947, Vereide sponsored the first Washington meeting of the International Council for Christian Leadership , welcoming, representatives from the United States, Canada, Britain, Norw ay, Hungary, Egypt and China. In 1949, Vereide sent Wallace Haines to represent International Ch ristian Leadership (ICL) at a meeting of German Christians held at Castle Mainau in Switzerland. Haines later became Vereide's personal emissary to Europe. Haines was re placed in 1952 by the virulent Jewish anti- Communist Nazi, Karl Leyasmeyer. THE 'PRAYER BREAKFAST' MOVEMENT ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE In 1953, Vereide 'made his first entree into the White House when President Dwight Eisenhower agreed to attend the first Pres idential Prayer Breakfast. By that time, Vereide's Congressional core membership had expanded to include such Senators as Republicans Frank Carlson of Kansas and Karl Mundt of South Dakota. Both were virulent anti-Communists who established close ties with Vereide and his worldwide anti- Communist movement. Vereide also became very close to one of the US Senate's most ardent segregationists, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the man who led the Dixiecrat revolt against the Democratic Party in 1948'. Thurmond, an Illuminist who lived to be over 100 years old, 'later became a key implementer of Vereide's strategy to evangelize poor Whites in the South. For Vereid e, this initiative was intended to recruit converts to his peculiar brand of Christianity; for Thurmond, it would bring into the Republican Party former New Deal Democr ats who saw their Party straying from seg- regation, and embracing civil rights. As for the United States, the strategy was calculated to bring a radical form of fundamental zealotry closer to taking control of the country'. Wayne Madsen elaborated that 'Buchman, clearly wishing to obfuscate his pro-Nazi ties before the war, turned his attention to wards Asia, particularly Korea. One Korean Presbyterian preacher, who took an interest in Buchman's Moral Re-Armament principles promoting a universal religion and total personal submission, was Yong Myung Mun from Korea. He later changed his name to Sun Myung Moon and, after being expelled from the Presbyterian Church for preaching heresy, he established a right-wing, strictly nominally Christian sect called the Unification Church'. This 'Church' has nothing, in fact, to do with True Christianity, and is allegedly yet another apostate aberration serving the intere sts of questionable 'Angels of Lighf. Like Vereide and Buchman, Moon started spreading his influence globally. He was probably recruited by Buchman, an operative (of course). 'The Washington Times' is linked to these people and may be financed by South Korean intelligence (KCIA, i.e. by the CIA)."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light THE GLOBAL REACH OF THIS FALSE 'CHRISTIAN' NETWORK By 1957, International Christian Leadership (ICL) had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups operating in Washington, DC alone. 'Around the world, it had set up another 125 groups - in Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Northern Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Ethiopia (where Emperor Haile Selassie provided ICL with property in Addis Ababa on which to build its African headquarters), India, South Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Guatemala, Cuba, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Bermuda'. Given hi s alleged intelligence background, Mr Madsen does not state the glaringly obvious - which is that this nexus of operations was and remains a covert operation of international intelligence - 'Dark Actors Playing Games'. Id's international activities coincided with activities in countries where the CIA was particularly active - an obvious by-product of the close cooperation between Vereide and the CIA's (Abwehr penetration) Allen Dulles and James Jesus Angleton. Angleton and his close associate, Miles Copeland, favoured using private businessmen to conduct operations that the CIA was statutorily barred from undertaking' - this being one of the beginnings of the process of privatisation of US intelligence operations which has led to such disastrous botches and consequences. 'International Christian Leadership fitted the bill very nicely. And although The Fellowship despised homosexuals, that did not stop the [homosexual] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, writing a prayer for Vereide'. Nor does Mr Madsen omit the rather well-know n Nazi associations of the Bush family. He notes that 'the grandfather of George W. Bush had witnessed the assets of Union Banking Corporation, on the board of which he served, seized after the beginning of the Second World War by U.S. Treasury agents. It turned out that Bush's bank was operated by Bush and his boss Averell Harriman on behalf of Nazi Germany. Prescott's father-in-law, George Herbert 'Berf Walker, also represente d Nazi German interests through his Brown Brothers Harriman investment company and affiliated firms with names like American Shipping & Commerce, Harriman Fifteen Corporation, Holland American Trading Corporation, Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation, the Silesian-American Corporation, and Hamburg-Amerika Line, which were all tangled together in a circuitous spider's web [see Chapter 8]. These arrangements represented a collective blueprint for future Bush family/oil and intelligence enterprises involving election fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and political assassinations'. 'Charles Lindbergh also had a run-in with the US Government. After being awarded the Service Cross of the German Eagle medal by Hermann Goering, Lindbergh, an ex-Army Air Force Colonel, was not permitted to have his commission as an officer restored - under direct orders from Roosevelt himself. Roosevelt always believed that Lindbergh was a Nazi. Lindbergh became an advocate for the United States avoiding war with Germany, through his activity with the Am erica First Committee - yet another group sprung from the pro-Nazi 'right-wing' in America', Wayne Madsen explained, but actually an operation directly controlled by the Nazi International. According to Lindbergh's biographer, Laura Muha, Lindbergh said that he was suspicious of American Jews because of 'their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our Government'. However the Nazi International's heirs and the Zionists 'agree'. Their ideology is identical, as the behaviour of the Likud Government in Israel testifies. Many leading Nazi Holocaust operatives were conspicuously Jewish."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 411 WEARING THE 'JESUS' LABEL, MEMBERS CAN GAIN A FALSE RESPECTABILITY With consummate skill, Wayne Madsen weaved in most of the 'big names' that have been causing such concern within the huge American 'underground', and internationally, as the aggressive, 'Amerika First' policies of the Bush Jr. Administration have unfolded. One of the subsidiary points he made was that the 'Jesus logo' provided operatives and politicians with more than just the cover they needed: it also enabled them to be 'forgiven for their transgressions because they had submitted to God (The Fellowship). A number of observers of The Fellowship claim that politicians love to get involved with the group because it is a way for them to escape accountability for their actions'. Mr Madsen's inclusion of this 'advantage' tells us plainly that The Fellowship' is indeed a devilishly subtle control mechanism which has been tailored to suit the 'needs' of German secret Illuminati strategy by expert psychologi cal operatives who, having studied Christianity, are exploiting its 'forgiveness' dimension for nefarious ends. Because members of The Fellowship know that they are liable to be 'forgiven' for any slip-ups or misdeeds, and because few of these people are True Christians (by which is meant, that they read Scripture seriously every day and take Communion), they accept membership with the subliminal knowledge that their fellows can be relied upon to 'forgive' (that is, overlook) any behaviour which falls short of the supposed ideas for which The Fellowship purports to stand. For instance, President George Bush Sr. 'reportedl y held a special prayer with El Salvador's President [Alfredo] Cristiani and the death squad leader d'Aubuisson, in a side room at a National Prayer Breakfast'. Inroads have also been made at US universities, through the related 'Campus Crusade for Christ' (CCC), and within the US military through offshoot entities known as the 'Officers' Christian Fe llowship' (OFC), and the 'Christia n Military Fellowship' (CMF) among enlisted ranks. The international arm is known as the 'Association of M ilitary Christian Fellowships' (AMCF). A well-publicised incidence of this crude confusion of good with evil was a statement in 2003 at a Baptist church in Daytona Beach, Florida, by US Army Lieutenant General William 'Jerry' Boykin, head of the special intelligence branch serving the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfe ld, that the United States is a 'Christian nation' and that, referring to a Somali warlord, 'I knew that my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol'. 'Shortly afterwards', Wayne Madsen writes , 'Boykin's intelligence branch was dis- covered to have been involved with the sexual molestation and torture of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sexual molestation of prisoners included male and female teens being held in Iraq'. The OCF operates 'chapters' at locations such as Fort Leavensworth, Kansas, 'the home of the US military's disciplinary barracks and a prime recruiting and mentoring centre fo r Fellowship members'. It is clear from Mr Madsen's account that 'Christianity' is used for mental management and internal military psychological manipulation purposes. That would be entirely consistent with the 'Heart of Darkness' characteristic of the US intelligence community. And according to Jeff Sharlet, of the Cent er for Religion and Media at New York University, writing in Harper's in 2003, inte rnationally the objective of The Fellowship's separate, aggressive 'Youth Co rps' is 'to groom young leaders for future positions of leadership in countries around the world'. Sharlet wrote that its target is '\"two hundred national and international world leaders bound together relationally by a mutual love for God and the family\". In Fellowship-speak, the \"family\" is synonymous with 'The Fellowship', so this statement has a double meaning, typical of the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: The Angels of Light FRENETIC GOINGS-ON AT 'THE CEDARS', ARLINGTON • CALLING EVIL GOOD The Fellowship is based at a property, now closely guarded, in Arlington called The Cedars, adjacent to which are two further 'group homes' (dormitories) called Ivanwald (a group home for men) and Potomac Point (a group home for women). Local groups have complained of 'certain VIP limousines constant ly speeding through this quiet and residential neighbourhood in North Arlington'. One neighbour has observed that some 80 limousine trips are made to The Cedars per week. A US State Department bus transports foreign and US diplomats to and from The Cedars for what is referred to as an 'Ambassadors' Breakfast' held every Tuesday morning from 7.30 am to 9.30 am, and more limousines arrive at The Cedars every Sunday for another meeting. Perhaps its importance as an international rendezvous point is why several miles of fibre optic cables have been installed at The Cedars by Verizon and Comcast. 'In one instance', added Madsen, 'The Fellowship reque sted permission to build an 'underground chapel' on The Cedars premises. Although the facility was never built, neighbors suspected that it was a bomb shelter'. Whether invitees at The Cedars undergo any mind-bending treatment at this facility is so far unknown: in the United Kingdom, a s ubversive organisation calling itself 'Common Cause', which has links with an office at the centre of government in Whitehall, is reported to be geared to the transformation of the mental attitudes of its targets within the space of 48 hours, using i nput traceable to the sinister Tavistock Institute. It was reported in October 2005 to have 84,000 members across the United Kingdom and was alleged to be involved in manipulative and corrupt activities in many sectors. A parallel organisation of the same name in the United States purports to be tracking corruption, but has a concealed agenda as well. The widespread infestation of both the British and the American political and social systems by such clandestine influence- building, mind-control and false-flag intelligence operations is a matter for the gravest concern - given the hegemony of the intelligence communities, which are both out of control and in control in both countries. Quite apart from any other consideration, given the interpenetration of intelligence communities with cadres and operatives having loyalties to one or more foreign powers, such networks, including the extremely sinister 'Jesus logo' networks which provide cover for Nazi-derived attitudes and for corrupt relationships and transactions, are being leveraged as platforms for deep penetration and subversion operations Summing up the general ethos of the networks of 'Angels of Lighf that he had identified', Wayne Madsen concluded that The Fellowship is an organisation where 'people smile, talk about their commitment to \"Jesus\", and engage in backroom shady deals', while enjoying 'fellowship' with kingmakers and as sassins'. This Author was surprised when a dangerous US intelligence officer offered him various 'Christian blessings'. Making due allowance for the likelihood that Mr Madsen is unsympathetic to 'right-wing' politics, the central point he makes is that 'Jesus' is being exploited by The Fellowship, which is an intelligence operation, for entirely cynical, worldly, and usually nefarious reasons. This practice, as has been seen in this Chapter, is nothing new: it began in Jerusalem and Rome in the First Century AD, and it was elaborated, for instance, by the Jesuits and Opus Dei, to name only two of the most conspicuous perpetrators of such Satanic deception. And for those who do not understand that the labels 'left-wing' and 'right-wing' mask the 'phanes' or 'forces' that the Illuminati and the geo-masonic fraternity believe they can, and possess a right to, manipulate, the existence of a global movement of 'Christians' may seem perfectly acceptable."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 413 But like all other 'Angels of Light', memb ers of The Fellowship are deceiving them- selves and everyone else. Those who are not deceived, of course, are the manipulators - who, since this organisation is based in Ar lington, can only be elements of the Central Intelligence Agency. True to the 100% cynicism which characterises intelligence com- munities everywhere, the CIA operatives runn ing this now massive network are cynically exploiting 'Christianity' for political, intelligence and strategic purposes - just as other branches of the same Octopus have for decades been building upon the Works of Darkness inherited and imported from Himmler's scientific death camp experimental operations, and seeking to leverage mind-bending and person ality-modification programmes, drugs and the occult for the same purposes. For, so far as the Illuminati manipulators are concerned, 'Christianity' is just another, extremely promising, instrument for the fulfilment of their global hegemony project Hitler's Nazis cynically exploited 'Christianity' in exactly the same manner. The obvious scriptural riposte for these pe ople is repeated. It appears in Isaiah, Chapter 5, verses 20 and 21: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!'. ■ Chapter 6: THE ANGELS OF LIGHT: Notes and references 1. The Apostle Paul, writing his Second Epistle to the Cori nthians in around AD 60, was alarmed that the flock he had preached to some years earlier, had been subo rned and corrupted by false priests, 'p reaching another Jesus whom we have not preached'... or 'another spirit which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted': Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 11, verse 4. 2. 'Lest, by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his s ubtlety... your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ': Paul's Second Ep istle to the Corinthians, Chapter 11, verse 3. 3. 'False apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ': Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 11, verse 13. Jeremiah, whom the Lord mentioned (indicating the great importance he attached to that most glorious of Old Testament prophets) had provided Paul with many precedents for this insight. For example: 'Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. They have made it des olate, and be ing desolate, it mour neth unto me': Jeremiah, Chapter 12, verses 10-11. The spiritual captivity of the wayward children of Israel is mourned by the Lord through Jeremiah: 'My soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord's flock is carried away captive': Jeremiah, Chapter 13. verse 17. 4. 'And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers als o be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end s hall be according to t heir works': Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians, Chapter 11, verses 14-15. See Jeremiah, Chapter 14, verses 14-15: Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy in my name: I sent them not, neither have I comman ded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the dece it of their heart.... By sword and famine (metaphorically - Ed. ) shall those prophets be consumed'. In other words, quite obviously, there is nothing new about false prophets - as anyone contemplating the utterly abysmal and abominable condition of the decadent Church of England, headed by the Archdruid of Canterbury, can clearly observe. 5. Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 18: 'Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is: Six hundred threescore and six'. See also: 1 Kings, Chapter 10, verse 14; 2 Chronicles, Chapter 9, verse 13: 'Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold'. See box, page 347. 6. Modern attempts to replicate the Pythagorean-Kabbalistic nu merical value of a word flounder on the problem that only words of Greek or Hebrew derivation can be successfully analysed by this method, and all words to be analysed must be spelled in their most ancient and complete forms. Therefore, Old Testament words and names must be translated back into the early Hebrew characters, and New Testament words into the Greek. The original Pythagorean system of numerical philosophy contains nothing to justify the practice in vogue today of changing the given name or surname in the hope of improving the temperament or financial condition by alterati on of the name vibrations. The system of 'Kabbalistic' calculation in vogue for the English language has no relationship to the Hebrew Kabbalistic system or to the Greek procedure. The fact that Pythagoras used 10 as the basis of calculation, whereas the modern system uses 9, an imperfect number, is in itself almost conclusive. Furthermore, the arr angement of the Greek and Hebrew letters does not agree closely enough with the English to permit the application of the num ber sequences of one language to the number sequences of the others. Under the prevailing fake Kabbalistic system, the lett ers A-l are numbered 1-9, J-R 1-9 x 10, and S-Z 1-8 x 100. Using this system one cannot replicate the fact that in Greek, L ATEINOS devolves to 666. Manly P. Hall states in his rare work (op. cit.) that 'the number of the beast (666) is an interesting example of the use of Qabbalism in the New Testament and among early Christian mystics'. The four separate Greek names given by Irenaeus (pupil of Polycarp, who was a pupil of John) as meaning Antichrist 'all have 666 as their numerical equivale nt'. Remarkably, too the Greek term that sign ifies the lower mind has 666 as its Kabbalistic numerical equivalent 7. Halley's Bible Handbook, Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, page 726, Note on 666, the Number of the Beast. The Author is certain that this interpretation is correct, not least since, contrary to the mistaken assessments of many, all such prophetic allusions in Scripture are of a spiritual nature. This also, applie s, for instance, to the identity of the"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"414 C HAPTER 6: The Angels of Light four kingdoms referred to in Daniel, Chapter 8. The Beast-Lamb is John's inspired description of Satan clothed as an 'Angel of Light', and masquerading as 'the Vicar of Christ' when in fact it is the Pope himself wh o is worshipped and obeyed: he stands in the place of Christ, and accordingly it is no surprise that, through the centuries, the Ca tholic Church has seen to i t that the people receive their 'spiritual instructio n' from priests, which means that the instruction is filtered: they have been lar gely prevented or discouraged from reading Script ure, lest they see through the deception and understand the truth. A Catholic will always say he or she is Catholic, whereas he or she should say that he or she is a follower of Christ (not the Pope) - tha t is, a Christian. A study of the Catechism shows that it diverges sharply from the true scriptural Word of God through Jesus Christ. Moreover it is unfortunately the case that sincere Catholic priests and other 'religious' people insert make-believe an d fables into their accounts of Christ's lif e. For instance, the Author has a tape in which a very worthy and devoted Catholic religious inserts as 'fact' the illusion that Mary Magdalene de layed at the tomb and 'took' the shroud (= the Turin shroud!) in which Jesus had been wrapped, from the tomb, back to John's home, where Mary, the mother of Jesus, had been received, in accordance with one of Jesus' last words on the cross. This gr oss lie, uttered in all sincerity, was intended to 'join up' the awkward fact that the Turin shroud (ostensibly carrying a 'photographic' image of Jesus Christ) suddenly 'appeared' in the Middle Ages and has been revered as a 'relic' by naive Catholics ever since. The cloth has been scientifically examined and found to be of mediaeval date. But more to the point, if it h ad been 'necessary' for us to know what Jesus looked like, we would have been provided with this information from the outse t. The idea that it became available to humanity only in the Middle Ages is preposterous rubbish. This is a prize example of what Paul meant when he wrote, in the Second Epistle to Timothy, Chapter 4, verses 3 and 4: 'For the time will come wh en they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables'. The True Christian is able to discern and to discard the fables, knowing the purity of the truth. 8. See Note 4 above, 9. Acts of the Apostle s, Chapter 26, verse 26. 10.

The Queen of Heaven is the pagan goddess Astarte, and is condemned in Jeremiah, Chapter 7, verses 17-19: 'Seest t hou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jeru salem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. Do they provoke me to anger? Said the Lord: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?' See Jeremiah, Chapter 44, for the denouement, wherein the element of the remnant of Judah who have been displaced by the Babylonian invasion decided that they will go down to Egypt (metaphor for the Darkness) and will defy Jeremiah's warnings, even though he informs them that they will be destroyed (spiritually as well as physically, if they do so). In Jeremiah, Chapter 44, verses 17-19, they defiantly answer Jeremiah as follo ws: 'But we will certainly do whatever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn in cense unto the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then we had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and the famine. And when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our men?'

By which Jesus meant that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against faith in Him. This has been perverted and distorted b y the Catholic Church, which erroneously asserts that the Lord meant that the Gates of Hell would not prevail against the Papacy. The interpretation is illegitimate and is a distortion of the truth of the matter, which is obvious by considering the context. Hence the Author will cite the source in its context, from Matthew, Chapter 16, verses 15-19: 'He saith unto them [the disciples], But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ [the Anointed One], the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon bar-Jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven. And I say also unto thee, That t hou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it'. The Greek word PETRA meant rock, the rock being that of Peter's extraordinary faith, expressed when he proclaimed, through the Holy Spirit: T hou art the Christ, the Son of the living God'. The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against faith in Jesus Christ, who is God and Lord of all - and the ONLY name to which Evil Spirit responds in exorcism (a fact of profound importance and which provides proof of the existence of God as revealed through Jesus Christ. It is also a fact of which the devils are well aware: cf Acts, Chapter 19, verses 13-17, in which the sev en sons of Sceva, Chief of the priests, tried to exorcise demons by calling upon the name of Je sus without any repentance of their sorcery on their part: Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them[selves] to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified'. 29.

Also: Jeremiah, chapter 50, verse 8: 'Remov e out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans'; and Isaiah, Chapter 48, 20: 'Go ye forth of Babylo n, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, the L ord hath redeemed his servant Jacob'. In Scripture, much eternal spiritual truth is re vealed through historic al events and situatio ns. Here, Babylon is literally the ancient regional centre of occultic sorcery to where many of the children of Israel were exiled, and from where they re-acquired habits of sorcery with which their fathers had been familiar in the land of darkness (Egypt), and among the pagan tribes surrounding them in Caanan. The call in Sec ond Corinthians and Revelation for us to 'come out of her' an d to be separated from the Workers of Darkness, in order to be eligible for salv ation, is pertinent to those entrapped in 'Orders ' and false religious organisations masquerading as purporting to teach the Word of God but in reality teaching only 'the commandment s and doctrines of men' [see Colossians, Chapte r 2, verse 22]. The objective of the Illuminati is to procure the renewed hegemony of 'Babylon', a.k.a. the 'Ancient Mysteries'. 31.

Hebrews, Chapter 7, verses 24-26: 'But this man, be cause he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens'. Romans, Chapter 8, verse 27: 'And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God'. The saints are those of us who believe and have faith, securing thereby the grace to grow, learn and understand in the Spirit. Saints are not those who are appointed to be saints by the Pope: beatification is a man-made usurpation of the power of God. All of those, without exception, who accept an d know Jesus as Our Lord and Saviour are sa ints. And intercession is ma de for us by the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ. 80. Hebrews, Chapter 8, verses 34-35: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who i s even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separ ate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?'. The intercessor for sinners is Jesus Christ and his Holy Spirit - directly, not through the Confessional which, as is shown here, is open to abuse - and has historically always been abused by the Jesuit Order, for es pionage purposes. That is one excellent reason why earthly intercession is precluded: Jesus was the greatest intellect that ever lived, and His logic is always perfection itself. 81. 'The Jesuit Enigma', B.

In October 2005, Nabil Shaath, who was formerly Palestinian Foreign Minister, reiterated information that had leaked into the public domain two years earlier, but which the UK and US media now, all of a sudden, treated as a brand new story. In a BBC interview, Mr Shaath said that President Bush had told him that he had been on a 'mission from God' when he ordered the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. According to Shaath, Bush Jr. had said: 'God would tell me, \"George, go and fight those terrorists in Af ghanistan\". And I di d. And then G od would tell me, \"G eorge, go and end the tyranny in Iraq\". And I did'. According to 'The Daily Telegraph' [9th October 2005], 'Saath has since modified his original account of Bush's words during the Israeli-Palestinian Summit at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud Abbas' [a.k.a. the Hamas terrorist operative and leader, Abu Mazen, who has been 'rehabilitated' and repackaged for international public consumption as a 'moderate'], 'the Palestinian Prime Minister and who was also present at the meeting, now say Bush did not claim that he had \"felt God's words coming to me\". The White House has also denied that Bush said anything of the kind'. Official denials aside, the point to be made here is t hat there is no way t hat God would have encouraged Mr Bush Jr.. to murder up to half a million people (and counting). If there was (is) a voice urging the President of the United States to perpetrate atrocities (very likely), it is not that of God, but of a familiar, or possessing demon, who is of course deceiving him. 102.

Bush's first Treasury Secretary - Ron Suskind revealed that a Top Secret document was made available to him within a few days of the President's first Inauguration in January 2001, in which advanced preparations for an invasion of Iraq were revealed. Hence, the invasion was far from spontaneous, preparations for it having preceded President Bush Jr.'s el evation to the Presidency by months, and probably years. Likewise, President Clinton met Russian officials in Washingt on, DC, on 1st and 2nd August 2000, to discuss issues affecting Afghanistan, including a planned invasion of that country. Neither of President Bush Jr's aggressive wars were therefore originally of his making: see Figure 94, page 607. 103. 'Chicago Tri bune', 7th December 2003. 104.

The use of the word Th reshhold in her book title may have been innocent, but to 'the interested', its use has secret Masonic meaning. West German Radio commented: The insights that this book provides into the secrets of the Roman headquarters of Opus Dei - from its secret-service-like membership list to the specific spirit of the founder of Opus Dei - are unique.

Here is the whole of this crucial passage, which reveals that the Catholic Church's de facto wo rship of the Virgin Mary is none other than the same reprobate worship of the Egyptian goddess Osiris, the Queen of Heaven or, in Canaan, Astarte: 'Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt' (remember, Egypt is also a metaphor for Darkness), 'in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not harken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the ci ties of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. And when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men? Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his mind? So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day' [which was hist orically at that stage indeed the case - Ed.]. 'Because ye h ave burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people and unto all the women, hear the word of the Lord, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her; ye will surely accomplish your vows, and will surely perform your vows. Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, the Lord God liveth. Behold... all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by t he sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them'. And indeed, those Jews that had fled into Eg ypt at that stage of the diaspora (caused by their offences against the Word of God that had been revealed to them exclusively) duly vanished from the record, and were heard of no more. 110.

Babylon is the met aphor used in Jeremiah and Revelation for organised, institutionalised religious sorceries. See Revelation, Chapter 18, verse 21: 'And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more ...... And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth'. And Revelation, Chapter 12, verse 9: 'And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the De vil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him'. 112. 'Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei', Maria del Carmen Tapia, The Continuum Publishing Company, New York, 1999, op. cit, page 277. 113. Because of the importance of this, the Author re peats here the scriptural references given in Note 98 above: Matthew, Chapter 23, verse 27: 'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness' - a description highly applicable to the final category of 'Angels of Light' that we are about to discuss here. See again Acts, Chapter 23, verses 1-3: 'And Paul, earnestly beholding all the council, said, men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?' 114. There are many references in Scripture to the illusions of those who either say 'there is no God' [Psalm 14, verse 1: The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God'], or who imagine that He is ignorant of what they are up to. For instance, Ezekiel, Chapter 8, verse 12, cited earlier in this book: Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? For they say, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth'. 115. 'New York World Telegram', 26th August 1936, cited by Wayne Madsen: William A. H.

According to Mr Madsen, one conservative Christian picked up similar notions from George W. Bush's sec ond inaugural speech. Christian commentator John Lofton questioned Bu sh's praise of the Koran during his speech and his giving the Islamic text equal weight to the Old and New Testaments. Lofton also questioned Bush's failure to mention Jesus Christ in his Christmas address a few weeks earlier. Lofton noted: \"Bush failed to mention the name of Christ -yet he honored Ramadan and an Indian holiday that features an eight-legged elephant god\". What many evangelical Christians fail to understand is that as a \"one world religion\" adherent of Vereide and Buchman, Bush only pays lip service to Jesus, while advancing a Dominionist (\"Fascist\") plan for global control. Note: The significance of the Muslim Brotherhood is generall y understated. Hitler didn't ju st 'support' this subversive terrorist organisation. The German Abwehr created it, as a m eans of destabilising British influence in the Middle East. The reasons for the folding of the British Empire include, but are not limited to, ongoing German-inspired subversion. The offensive against Britain and America has continued relentlessly and ruthlessly ever since - with penetrations at the very highest levels in both countries, and German financial interests seizing control over intergovernmental trading. The German 'Black' Nazi strategic Continuum loathes the British even more than the Americans, if that can be imagined. ■"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 419 CHAPTER SEVEN THE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN EXPLOSIONS, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION FROM BELOW On 7th July 2005, 56 people were killed and 700 injured when explosions were triggered on the London Underground and aboard a bus which 'just happened' to be entering Tavistock Square. On 23rd July 2005, a similar terrorist operation which would have resulted in explosions from below was thwarted by elements of the British security services. In August 2005, reports surfaced from San Francisco that explosions had occurred below ground in several parts of the city. On 7th October 2005 , The New York Times reported that officials had stated that they had earlier been notified of a terrorist threat that, for the first time, had specifically identified New York City's underground transit system as the target. The report appeared following th e sudden closure of the Metro as a consequence of the discovery of a bottle out of which was oozing a green liquid. A few days later, there were reports that explosions had been feared in the Baltimore underground transit system. In April 2006, UK intelligence sources informed the Author that a fifth bomb was 'meant' to have been detonated inside the Northern Line of the London Undergr ound transit system beneath the Thames on 7th July 2005, as a result of which the river would have flooded a vast proportion of the system, murdering thousands. About a year earlier, the Author, walking in the Amtrak level at Penn Station, New York City, had noticed a doorway opening from the station area to a passageway in which a large number of garbage bags had been stacked, and which clearly represented a terrorist hazard. On reporting this to the Amtrak Police, he was su rprised when the matter was treated in a manner suggesting less than urgency. The Twin Towers and Building Number 7 were not, as the deliberately unresolved controlled disinformation barrage has implied, brought down by aircraft hitting the tall buildings and by some mysteriously unexplained 'aftershock' which caused the third building to implode suddenly at around 5.30pm, but rather by high-tech explosives, such as RDX or C-4, capable of expanding at 1,000 feet per second and of creating extremely hot temperatures (much hotter than aircraft fuel, which when mixed with air, burns at around 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit). Moreover the two tall buildings collapsed in a controlled and peculiar manner which, honest (as opposed to controlled) experts say, would be consistent with the use of modern explosives capable of causing the crystallisation of building materials, while creating a vacuum that could cause the buildings to implode at a faster than normal speed, and leaving a residue of extremely high temperatures. The North Tower was completely demolished at 10.29 am, one and a half hours after the first alleged aircraft impact, within the space of 8.1 seconds. It fell neatly upon itself and its remains were 'perfectly powdered'. According to the Law of Falling Bodies promulgated by Galileo and still accepted today by scientists everywhere 1 , the total dis-"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"420 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan tance travelled at the end of any specific time in a total vacuum is calculated by the fol- lowing formula: Distance (d) = (32.16/2) x Time in seconds squared. If there is any resistance, then the speed and time of the falling body slows down in relation to the resistance encountered. The No rth and South World Trade Center Towers were known to be 1,350 feet tall, so that the following equation would yield the fastest possible time for a total drop in a vacuum (that is to say, an environment where no resistance exists): 1350 = (32.16/2) x Time in seconds squared. This would yield 9.1627 seconds as the f astest time that these buildings could pos- Figure 64: The seismic activity on 9/11, recorded by Columbia University Seismology Group: Top image A: The seismic data for the North Tower; Lower image B: The seismic data for the collapse of Building #7.

The calculation raises some extremely interesting questions because the South Tower collapsed in 10.4 seconds and the North Tower, as indicated, imploded totally within 8.1 seconds. In both cases, massive resistance 'impeded' the collapses - in the form not least of the massive lower sections of the buildings that were stabilised by over 250 huge interior and exterior steel columns, and thousands of steel trusses. Therefore, the collapses defied the law of gravity. It follows either that the heights of the buildings were in accurate, the times taken for the collapses were inaccurate, the scientific calculation acknowl edged by scientists worldwide for hundreds of years is inaccurate - or something pulled these buildings down at a faster rate. And 'something' caused the delayed implosion of Building Number 7, which only caught fire, in a modest way, at 3.00pm. It collapsed at 5.25pm in what appeared to be a conventional demolition, with the walls falling neatly in on themselves and the rubble being cracked and broken but not pulverised. Neither FEMA nor any other authority published information to explain what had happened to this bu ilding, which had housed a CIA Stat ion, offices of the Department of Defense and the Secret Service, and a $ 13 million 'control bunker' which had been constructed on the orders of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As for Building Number 6, a huge explosion appeared to emanate from the centre sec tion of this building, but it only caught fire later - burning for hours at elevated temperatur es, raising the so far unanswered question as to what caused the building to explode before it caught fire. BUILDINGS DEMOLISHED BY HIGH-TECH EXPLOSIVES The grey cloud that blasted out concentrically from the imploding buildings, as thousands of people (but no employees, for instance, of Morgan Stanley and other organisations 'in the know') were being murdered and billions of dollars' worth of property was being destroyed, which chased thousands of New Yorkers down the Downtown streets, covering the entire area as far as the Author's Midtown Office with a grey sand-like substance, has of course, been analysed. It consisted of crystallised cement and other materials. No blast of jet fu el, mixed with air, could have created this crystallisation, because jet fuel only expands at 208 feet per second, which is not enough speed for the purpose. Nor could a compression demolition ha ve induced such crystallisation, as it would not have created suffic ient latent energy: the cement would have cracked and broken, but it would not have pulverised. The only way that the molecular composition of these materials could have been so scrambled would have been by means of the use of small-scale nuclear devices or high- tech explosives. Although there were reports of 'hot-spots' for many weeks afterwards, unusual readings of radioactivity were neve r reported (although they could have been suppressed of course); and in their absence, the only alternative cau se of the buildings collapsing in breach of the law of gravity would be the use of modern explosives. High-tech explosives such as RDX or C-4 can expand at more than 1,000 feet per second, while creating ultra-hot temperatures. Modern explos ives could cause the crystallisation of the building materials, creating indeed a vacuum that would, in combination, induce the buildings to implode at faster than norma l speed, leaving a residue of extremely high temperatures. The dust from the explosions, which saturated, for instance, this Author's Midtown Office, had a high mercury content as well as radioactivity from smoke alarm detectors and other poisonous toxins all breathe d in by New Yorkers, along with the stench of rotting flesh, which lasted we ll into 2002. As late as March that year, the smell persisted, although New Yorkers seem ed impervious to it."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan All 9/11 investigations, or purported independent analyses, that overlook the use of explosives have been cover-up operations, or ganised 'with malice aforethought' (see below) and designed to confuse the public and to divert attention from any focus upon the demolition of the buildings due to the placement of high-tech explosives inter alia below ground level. Figures 65 and 66 show the scene of the devastation taken from a law office building a few months after the atrocities: note the adjacent upright buildings, with respect to which impact from the explosions was not sufficient to cause more than repairable damage. One further piece of evidence is appropriately included here. On 16th September 2001, NASA flew a special aircraft over the site of the New Yo rk atrocity to take measurements and to create a thermal surface map. W ithin the week since the atrocities, hundreds of truckloads of debris and human remains had already been carried off site, and firemen had sprayed millions of gallons of water on the smoking rubble. The immediate availability of clean-up equipment on such a colossal scale was in itself 'remarkable'. The results of NASA's investigations reveal ed (contrary to the interests of cover-up operatives) that there were indeed several 'hot spots' with temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit on the surface (never mi nd the temperatures far below ground level), while there was one hot-spot at the South Tower that recorded 1,377 degrees. New Yorkers, and this Author, noticed that the area continued to smoke for weeks. The Author's Midtown Office was, as noted, covered in dirty grey particles the following October; and as late as February 2002, the stench of rotting flesh, which New Yorkers (as opposed to part- time New Yorkers like the Author) appeared to have become accustomed to, at times made the Author feel nauseous. Figure 67 on page 425 is a photograph of the Twin Towers taken by the Author's youngest daughter, who had just reached Figure 65: View of the devastation following 9/11 from an adjacent building, taken several months after the llluminati's 'pearl harbor' defining event for the 21st c entury. The buildings were demolished by a cadence of computer-controlled bomb explosions triggered deep underground, in accordance with the final paragraph of Protocol 9 of the 'blame-shifting' 'sib' document called 'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion', which explicitly stated that 'capitals will be blown in to the air' from underground subterranean corridors."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 423 New York on a round-the-world trip: the pictur e was taken from the Staten Island Ferry on the evening of 10th September 2001. Alice and a friend had originally decided to visit the Twin Towers at about 9.00 am on 11th September 2001, but decided on the spur of the moment to do so on the evening of 10th September, which they did before boarding the ferry for a view from the water. That night, Alice could not sleep an d was disturbed by an ominous expectation of the catastrophe which duly occurred at the moment when she and her friend had intended to be among visitors to the Twin Towers. SERIES OF BOMBS DETONATE IN CADENCE Neither tons of jet fuel, nor a compression demolition, have the potential to create the levels of surface heat recorded by NASA, much less to maintain such heat levels for days afterwards; so any impartial investigator would need to have concluded that there was another explanation for such extreme temperatures. Moreover steel melts at about 2,700 degrees, and the vast steel columns at the base of the foundations, some 70 feet below ground, had been melted. When elaborate preplanned cover-up arrangements were put in place ahead of the atrocities, someone forgot to indoctrinate the Columbia University Seismology Group working at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Laboratory.

The pattern registered by the collapse of World Trade Center Building Number 7 was significantly smaller in magnitude, and represented the signature of a conventional explosion. The Author hypothesises that Building Number 7 was meant to have been demolished simultaneously amid the confusion of the destruction of the Twin Towers, but that something malfunctioned and that it had to be demolished separately, as soon as possible, by hastily contrived back-up means 2 . Among almost 3,000 people who were murdered in this abomination were 658 employees of the financial firm Cantor Fitzge rald. Maturing derivatives contracts held by that firm were, as a consequence of the atro city, all of a sudden forgiven. The firm 'dealt with' the aftermath of this matter by dedicating 25% of the partners' profits to the families of the murder victims for five years (ending on 11th September 2006) and providing for medical and welfare costs for the victims's families for ten years. On the morning of 11th September 2001, a custodian and key-holder at the World Trade Center, William Rodriguez, was late arriving at work, having overslept, and was walking to his office in the tunnel which jo ined the Twin Towers. This experienced eye- witness, who knew every coiner of the structures, reports that while in this tunnel he heard blasts from the basement area at about 8.30 am, which was significantly earlier than the time at which the first aircraft allegedly hit the South Tower. As the holder of master keys, he was able to rescue a large number of people from certain death, and his testimony is among that of others who have confirmed multiple explosive charges throughout the buildings which occurred quite independently of aircraft collisions. Mr Rodriguez was to have broadcast his account on the Telemundo TV st ation, a subsidiary of NBC, which is in turn owned by General Electric, an organisation controlled by the Rockefeller family. Commissioned by Telemundo in 2005 to appear in their studios, he was informed at the last minute that the broadcast was to be postponed, ostensibly while the producers sought a witness who would be in a position to put forward a contrary perspective. Naturally, the broadcast never happened. As has been the case with all the delib erately traumatising mass psychological operations (Psy-Ops) events contrived over the years by the Illuminati, the authors of the 9/11 catastrophe, like the perpetrators of the murders of Presid ent Jack Kennedy and Princess Diana, have remained at large. In all these cases, as with 9/11, a vast, preplanned cover-up operation, elaborated by specialist di version operatives, was in place: in the case of Diana, her obituary was written on the Friday prior to her murder. THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION WARFARE DIVERSION OPERATION In the United States, the cover-up team, with unlimited funds at their disposal, acquired immediate control of alternative media perceptions, so that the authorities were able to direct not only the '9/11 Movement', but also the 9/11 issue in the alternative media. The main device used for this purpose was the creation of fake Internet opposition sites - plus the misdirection of websites, the creation of front organisations (see below), the invention of pseudo-activist groups and the mobilisation of Hogging and web journalism liars, all acting in concert to create an 'impenetrable fog'. These people control a vast amount of the deliberately conflicting 'free' information that is available on the Internet, and many such intelligence community-related 'assets' were put in place long before 9/11. Their primary objective in the aftermath of 9/ 11 was to ensure that if any truth about the Illuminati mass murders and atrocities committed on 9/11 were to emerge, it would be 'truth' designed and controlled by intelligence agencies - with CIA"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 425 assets in position (as in the press rooms of the mainstream media) to ensure misdirection, diversion, disinformation and damage limitation. Another device was the igniting of what have been termed 9/11 Movement 'flame wars', in which different intelligence 'assets ' attacked each other in order to undermine their credibility individually and collectively, and to disillusion ordinary grassroots 9/11 truth activists, with whom the United States is richly endowed. In other words, protest at the obvious inaccuracies, lies, diversionary report s and disinformati on surroundi ng 9/11 has been 'successfully' controlled, managed, and defanged by intelligence operatives from the outset 3 . The underlying purpose of this vast damage limitation exercise was to leave the field open for false 'truth seekers' whose real job has been to cover up the corruption, or who belong to rival criminalist gangs seeking to destabilise the organised criminal operatives currently in power. For the perpetrators of 9/11 have everything to lose if they are exposed, and masses to gain if they remain in control. 'Furthermore, 9/11 was not their first crime. Many of them were involved in other crimes that they must cover up' 4 as well. And that's putting it mildly. The Author was himself witness to a 'fake front' operation controlled by intelligence operatives - which, in this case, went badly wrong. The 9/11 atrocities form part of a litany of criminal operations perpetrated by rival yet cooperating Illuminati criminalists stretching back for decades, at least as far back as President Kennedy's murder, but in reality to years earlier. In June 2002, the Author was invited to a presentation by an organisation calling itself Unanswered Questions , run by an operative named Kyle Hence, which purported to represent the interests of the 9/11 bereaved. Mr Hence collaborated with an independent patriotic activist who contributed 50% of the cost of hir- Figure 67: View of the Downtown Manhat tan skyline with the Twin Towers on the evening of 10th September 2001, taken from the Staten Island Ferry by the Author's fourth daughter.

Not long before the scheduled date, the independent activist received reque sts from a significant number of people who called 'out of the blue' asking if they could attend. At the meeting, which was packed, 32 sets of photocopied documents were dis- tributed, all obtained from public domain postings, 'dissident' intelligence sources, the Internet (and all of the above) which included copies of financial and banking transactions relating inter alia to the raising, under President George Bush Sr., of $27.5 trillion from over 200 international banks, the funds to be converted into US dollars, ostensibly for the benefit of a system for sustaining measures to protect what is euphemistically referred to as the 'Global Security Environmenf. The documents showed that for about 18 months in 1989-91, the 'payouts' in dollars were stalled at the Federal Reserve Board, under Dr Alan Greenspan; that colossal sums (calculated in 2005 by the Au thor to have amounted to $742.5 billion, but now believed to have been much higher) were rifled and diverted to recipients including offshore accounts held on behalf of the Bush Family and a lawyer acting for the Vatican and/or Opus Dei. After the US Secret Service Principal of these funds, Leo Wanta, identified and resisted Presidential demands for corrupt payments, he was framed, and deprived of his liberty for an intended for 22 years on fake charges, so that further looting by corrupt operatives and banks could proceed. The 32 files were distributed among attendees at this meeting, which was ostensibly about helping the families of the 9/11 bereaved, but which degenerated into sharp exchanges as intelligence operatives masqueradi ng as concerned activists on the platform argued with each other, wher eupon one of them seized th e microphone from a rival and proceeded more or less to close the meeting. The Author was a recipient of one of the 32 files; and with one exception, all the remaining files were distributed among the many attendees who had suddenly asked to be present. It subsequently transpired that these copies of the files had all been handed to intelligence officers - which meant, of course, that the damning documentary evidence wound up under the control of the CIA at Langley, which meant in turn that it was 'sterilised' and removed from the public domain. Or so the intelligence community believed - until the Author published excerpts from the financial documents in March 2003, followed by a complete exposure of all the relevant Federal Reserve financial transaction documents in February 2005 s . The other set of documents ostensibly not 'collected' by intelligence ope ratives on that occasion wound up in the hands of a well-known journal, whic h had done nothing by this book's press date to publicise the sobering international financial intelligence contained therein. BLOODLETTING, ATROCITIES AND FRANTIC DAMAGE LIMITATION On 26th December 2004, a devastating underwater 'earthquake' caused a tsunami that killed at least 300,000 people (100 times more than those killed in the 9/11 atrocities). Two impeccable intelligence sources, backed by separate independe nt research and supported by advance information provided by a third intelligence source, have confirmed that the devastation in Southeast Asia was induced by the use of satellite-mounted scalar technology. When one of the sources was asked whether the devastating earthquake that occurred in Pakistan in October 2005 was 'natural', the answer was in the negative, augmented by: 'And they know all about it'. This is true of the Indonesians in respect of the tsunami, also. Some idea of the deviousness of the mentality that presides over these deliberately traumatising atrocities can be derived from the following passage by the US intelligence analyst Michael Rupp ert (who has since fled to Caracas),"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 427 referred to earlier, who displays extensive US 'intelligence connections' which naturally places the independent observer on guard for possible disinformation: but in the United States, internal rivalries and tensions within the intelligence community and between its controlled and compromised placemen at the highest levels of government have long since resulted in the exposure of information and assessments which would otherwise never have been revealed, such as Rupert's assessment concerning 9/11 that: 'Within their own mindset and within the parameters of an economic and gov- ernmental system that functioned (as it continues to function) in the mode of organized crime - incapable of transparency, riddled w ith corruption and cooked books, based upon the destruction of life for the sake of net pr ofits and supremacy - these men, led by Dick Cheney, chose what they thought was their only logical option.

'But as all empires learn, once the river is crossed there is no turning b ack. In front of that decision, there lay a continuum of ever more vicious bl oodletting, decline, and collapse' 6 . The tensions between different factions within US intelligence or the Illuminati, or both, lead frequently to ugly scenes, such as an occasion in 2004 when, together on a podium, George Bush Sr. was observed pushing on former President Clinton's chest. At the time of President Reagan's memorial service in Washington, a putsch was foiled which had been intended to result in the assassinations of President George W. Bush Jr, Vice President Cheney, and the two most senior figures from the House of Representatives and the Senate - as a result of which Colin Powell would have been catapulted into the US Presidency. A second attempted coup, which was thwarted by British intelligence, was to have occurred when Air Force One was coming into land at Istanbul Airport for a NATO Summit Meeting. Components for an SA-2 missile battery which were to have been fired at Air Force One as it descended into the airport were discovered in a crate of spare parts, and the information was passed on to US intelligence in time to thwart the catastrophe. Damage limitation and control is such an essential prerequisite for the management of the consequences of intelligence scams, atrocities, abominations and deception machinations, that colossal resources have to be availabl e for deployment in order for cover-up operations to proceed and to be managed in accordance with the perpetrators' intentions. It was noticeable that at the close of 2004, certain known intelligence operatives masquerading as independent analysts with prominent website presence, were telling friends of the Author that the 'phase' of post-9 /11 trauma was 'all over now'. What they meant was that, so far as the controllers were concerned, the volume of sand that had been thrown into the air, and the levels and dimensions of the confusion that had been inserted into and generated within the public domain, had proved more than adequate for what was then the crime of the century (9/11) to have been successfully covered w ith so many false leads, diversionary e nquiries and 'conspiracy theories' that we could now at last all 'move on' -ready to manage the fallout from the next series of revolutionary provocations. So when it came to the scalar attack which generated the freak weather conditions supposedly 'responsible' for the breach of the ancient levees around New Orleans in September 2005, it was only necessary for FEMA (complete with its own pre-installed scapegoat, Michael Brown) to sit and do not a lot (apart from perpetrating such 'mistakes' as deliberately sending trucks with bottled water to the wrong side of the collapsed Mississippi bridge),"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"428 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan to ensure that, as usual, commentators competed among themselves to add to the public's confusion about what was happening. During that crisis, Mrs Barbara Bush was reported to have commented, concerning the poor Blacks who lost everything and were subsequently displaced, that 'they were deprived anyway' - which must have cheered many of those still able to operate battery- driven radios in the filthy Convention Center, or else who found themselves locked up in 'Camp Amtrak', the Amtrak Rail Station wh ich became a Federal prison overnight. And amid the confusion, everyone forgot to report that a resident living close to the main levee had heard a loud explosion at about 4.00am on the night of the hurricane, after it had departed. It later transpired that the levee had been breached at great depth, in a manner that could only have been procured by prepositioned explosives. The second leading Illuminati 'Black' regime of the 20th century, familiar to all of us as Nazi Germany, perpetrated its satanic atro cities in the perverse knowledge that no-one would believe what was happening, should leaks take place. And indeed, even within the innermost councils of the Brit ish Government, hardly anyone in power was prepared to waste time considering what the Nazis' industrialised murder machine was up to.

Immediately following the 7/7 explosions on the London Unde rground, and the explosion aboard a bus triggered by a terrorist who was thought to have been en route to an Underground Station, the Author identified the following text, which appears as the final paragraph of Protocol Number 9 in the notorious 'sib' document (slanted to implicate the Jews: see below) universally referred to as 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion': 'You may say that the Goyim [meaning 'Gentile cattle'] will rise upon us, arms in hand, if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against this a manoeuvre of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail -the undergrounds, metropolitains, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organisations and archives' 7 . It is guaranteed that no intelligence officer anywhere in the world will have been aware of, or interested in, the existence of this text ahead of any of the underground atrocities listed. However it is upon the basis of this text that the Author has advised certain author ities that the cities that are at special risk from these attacks are those which possess underground railway systems. The Author has done this knowing that the authorities concerned are themselves associated with forces responsible for the orchestration of these atroc ities, which are intended to catapult the world into the New Underworld Order. Before addressing the vexed issue of what 'The Protocols' - which are the Illuminati's instructions to 'the interested', slanted in such a way as to ensure that the Jews receive the blame for the atrocities comm itted in fulfilment of the instructions, which was how the Holocaust materialised - it is pertinent to draw attention to several other passages from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which have powerful contemporary resonance: • Protection against (centrally manipulate d) diseases by means of the central control and delivery of vaccines: 'It is indispensable to trouble in all coun-"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 429 tries the people's relations with their governments, so as to utterly exhaust humanity with dissension, hatred, struggle, envy and even by the use of tort ure, by starvation, BY THE INCOCULATION OF DISEASES, by want, so that the GOYIM see no other issue than to take refuge in our complete sovereignty in money and in all else'. Protocol Number 10, penultimate paragraph, op. tit. [see Note 7], pages 178-179. Note that the words in capital letters were capitalised in the original. Recall those contaminated flu jabs from the Liverpool factory of Chiron (the name of an odious underworld creature fro m Greek demonolo-gy) in 2004, and the 'bird 'flu' scare that erupted in the autumn of 2005. • Creation of fear of catastrophic even ts as a pretext for the removal of freedom: 'There is another reason also why they [the Goyim] will close their eyes: for we shall keep promising them to give back all the liberties we have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peace and tamed all parties'. [In the prevailing fake 'war against terror' context, liberties have been, and continue to be taken away, without even the promise of their restoration]. Op. cit., page 180, Protocol Number 11. • Enticement of targeted elites into Masonic Lodges for indoctrination, diversion, perpetuation and control purposes: [This] 'has served as the basis for our organisation of secret Masonry which is not known to, and aims which are not even so much as suspected by, these Goy cattle, attracted by us into the \"Show\" army of Masonic Lodges in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows'. Op. cit., page 181, Protocol Number 11. • Geomasonic interpretation of the word 'freedom' • The future of the press • Control of the media • Masonic solidarity in the press of today: The word freedom... is defined by us as follows: Freedom is the right to do that which the law allows. This interpretation of the word will at the proper time be of service to us, because all freedom will thus be in our hands, since the laws will abolish or create only that which is desirable for us according to the aforesaid programme....

Among those making attacks upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will attack exclusively points that we have pre-determined to alter.... Not a single announcement will reach the public without our control' [Consider the foregoing discussion about the fake, controlled Internet websites, which are listed in Note 4; and consider the situation prevailing in US newsrooms, where decisions as to which stories are to be covered and given prominence are taken on the basis of daily instructions from intelligence officers, a situation which appears to be replicated in the Un ited Kingdom].

All these Lodges we shall bring under one centra l administration, known to us alone and to all others absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders.

This is standard intelligence community procedure].

'. Op. cit., page 176, Protocol 10. This device was used by the Germans fronted by the French, against the British on 7th and 23rd July 2005. Shortly after that event, the Author was informed that instructions for the atrocities had been confirmed from the highest level of the French Government, with electronic traffic monitored from Singapore (where President Chirac had flow n in order to pitch for Paris to be awarded the 2012 Olympics), and later from the Gleneagles meeting of the Group of Eight industrialised countries. Due to the French a ssumption that GCHQ reports to the Secret UK 'Black' intelligence agency operating within MI 6 which in turn reports to DVD, Dachau, Chirac may have assumed that his terror instructions would never be leaked. Due to certain operational mishaps and following forensic analysis, British security authorities discovered the European provenance of the Lo ndon atrocities and demanded an immediate cessation, with an undercurrent of threat that Britain would leave the European Union if its demands were not met. The upshot of all this was that the IRA and its splinters, controlled by German 'Black' intelligence, was instructed by its German controllers to proceed immediately with full decommissioning of its weaponry, which (for public consumption) took place almost at once afterwards. Following the failed terrorist attacks on 23rd July, or perhaps prior to them, foreign 'Black' intelligence is believed to have ordere d the 15 terrorist cells then known by MI5 to be operating in Britain, to cease and desist pending further instructions. It later transpired, as noted, that a devastating fifth explosion was intended to have flooded the Northern Line. • The expansion of weaponry ['inventors of evil things': Romans, Chapter 1, verse 30]: 'The intensification of armaments, the increase of police forces, are essential for the completion of [our] plans. Op. cit., page 166, Protocol 7. • Elevation of economics to the highest profile, as a control mechanism: 'We shall surround our government with a whole world of economists .... Around us will be a whole constellation of bankers, industrialists and cap italists and - the main thing, millionaires - because in substance, everything will be settled by the question of figures'. Op. cit., page 168, Protocol Number 8. • The knowing and deliberate, systematic corruption of all youth: 'We have fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth of the Goyim by rearing them in principles and theories which are known by us to be false although it is by us that they have been inculcated'.

THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE ILLUMINATI'S AGENTUR The debate as to whether the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' represents a document of the Jewish Kahal, serving as a bluepr int for the Illuminati inside Fr eemasonry is still unresolved in the minds of many analysts. A campaign against all mention of The Protocols has continued ever since the proprietor of 'The Ti mes' of London was certified insane, two EXAMPLE OF DELIBERATE LEGISLATIVE COMPLEXITY A UK House of Commons Committee was considering, on 28th October 2005, a small change in the rules governing the fast-track expansion of popular schools. Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 1801, The Education (School Organisation Proposals) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 pr oposed a two- week reduction in two consultation periods, and applied the regulation to all Secondary Schools, not 'popular' ones only. It had taken 15 months to have this change cleared by Parliament. Even the obscure Minister responsible admitted that she was uncertain whether the new rule applied to Primary Schools as well as to Secondary Schools. Writing in The Times', London, on 29th October 2005, Alice Miles commented: The regulation gave a useful insight into t he bureaucracy that British parents... face. The 'Information to be contained in published proposals' began: \"(1) This regulation prescribes for the purposes of Section 28(3)(a), Section 29(3)(a), paragraph 5(2)(a) of Schedule 7 (where the proposals relate to a mainstream school) and paragraph 5(2)(a) of Schedule 23, the information which proposals published under Section 28 or 29, paragraph 5 of Schedule 7 or paragraph 5 of Schedule 23 must contain\".

Such deliberately obfuscatory gobbldegook can only , of course, be deciphered by expensive and, by definition, unproductive lawyers, whose livelih oods are guaranteed by such perverse legislative drafting. At the European Union level, verbal obfuscation has long since been elevated to the status of a refined art form, with dense and contradi ctory language guaranteed to enable the bureaucracy to escape responsibility for whatever superfluous legislative aberration may lurk within the parasitical entity's opaque drafting. Some years ago, Brussels officials brazenly celebrated the fact that their structures had released over a billion documents sinc e this political control mechanism was established in response to the imperatives of secret German long-range strategy [see Chapter 8].

Are we to dismiss the whole matte r without inquiry and to let the influence of such a book as this work unchecked?' 'The Mo rning Post', which was then the most sober and the oldest British newspaper, published 23 articles, also calling for investigation (not acceptance: investigation). Having been certified in sane by an unknown doctor from abroad, the publisher of 'The Times' was forcibly removed from control of his publications, whereupon 'The Times' published an article dismis sing 'The Protocols' as a plagiarism of an earlier French-Jewish work. In the United St ates, Mr Henry Ford, who had caused his 'Dearborn Independent' to publish a series of articles on 'The Protocols' of which 1.5 million reprints were sold, was prevailed upon in 1927 to publish an apology addr essed to a well-known American Jew. The pressure applied to Mr Ford reportedly came from Jewish car dealers upon whom the fortunes of his c oncern depended, just as a new model Ford was about to be marketed 8 . However if all Jewish connotations, angles and slants are removed from the text, it reads precisely as a set of instructions to student members of the Illuminati's Agentur. On this construction, some have argued persuasi vely that this document represents the Illuminati's blueprint for World Revolution, skillfully skewed so that the Jews would receive the blame for the abominations that would follow. Indeed, the Nazi attacks on the Jews, and the Holocaust itself, can be explained as one terrible example of the 'success' of such a diabolical strategy of false witness. As one the British War Correspondent, Douglas Reed, one of the foremost scholars of this subject wrote, in a brilliant posthumous book 'The authors may have been Jewish, non-Jewi sh, or anti-Jewish. That is immaterial.... Only the denouement remains, fiasco or fulf ilment. It is a grandiose plan, and in my estimation [it] cannot succeed. But it has existed for at least 180 years [at the time that Douglas Reed's work was comple ted in 1956, taking us straight to 1776 - Ed.] and probably for much longer, and 'The Protocols' provided one more proof in a chain of proofs [of the conspiracy - Ed] that has since been greatly lengthened. The conspiracy for world dominion through a world slave st ate exists and cannot at this stage be abruptly checked or broken off. [Given] the momentum that it has acquired, it must now go on to fulfilment or failure. Either will be destructive for a time, and hard for those of the time in which the denouement comes' 9 . We live in precisely that time. ISSUE OF WHETHER THE CURSE IS JEWISH OR NOT IS DIVERSIONARY Some brief recapitulation may be helpful here. As discussed in Chapter 5, Jewish authorities themselves state that 'Masonry is Jewish'. Yet despite the categorical and wholly convincing, authoritative statem ent by Dr Isaac M. Wise, cited by Samuel Oppenheim (see page 274) that 'Masonry is a Jewish institution', which is supported by so much objective evidence, the respected Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman disagrees, tracing the 'Jewishness' of Illuminised Freemasonry to the malevolent continuing influence of the 17th century false Messiah, Shabbetai Tzvi, who convinced perhaps half of world Jewry that he was the true Messiah and spawned a vast, pagan, permissive 'Sabbatian' movement. However Rabbi Antelman curiously fails to recall what the prophet Ezekiel witnessed the house of Israel doing 'in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery'. The Grand Lodge in Great Queen Street, Central London, has a large so-called 'Star of David' on the far wall, which dominates the dark chamber, even though, until th e late 18th century, Jews had been barred from the Lodge. But Masonry is also, in part, Rosicrucian,"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 433 as also discussed in Chapter 5. Most of all, it is both - being of the Kabbalah, the foun- tainhead of the poisonous waters of Babylon, seat (or a primary seat) of the 'Ancient Mysteries', which have to do with sorcery, divination, magic, the invocation of evil spirits and, as provided for in the rare Rosicrucian-Masonic book by Manly P. Hall which has also been discussed, the summoning up of the Devil himself, or of demons representing themselves as the Devil. With such Work s of Darkness, no-one should ever even contemplate having any dealings, since their end is always the same (as the Devil has only one product): death, both spiritual and physical. Freemasonry is nothing more nor less than what 'the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of hi s imagery. For they say, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth' 10 . This was part of a vision of the prophet Ezekiel, who was shown by the Lord the abominations co mmitted by members of the house of Judah 11 in the Masonic Lodge of the era. These practices were acquired from Babylon, where men (like the Masons today) were 'girded with girdles upon their loins' 12 , from the unreformed pagan Devil-worshipping tribes of Canaan, and from Egypt (the Biblical metaphor for 'the Darkness'). Ezekiel explains, using the metaphor of two young women, Aholah (identified by Ezekiel as Samaria) and Aholibah (identified by Ezekiel as Jerusalem), how the children of Israel went 'a-whoring' after pagan false deities - lusting after their associated abominations (precisely) of sorcery, divination, magic, and the invocation of evil spirits. At the time of Jesus, the Samaritans were looked down upon by the scribes, the Pharisees and the people of Jerusalem as a mixed race, polluted by intermarriage with Assyrians and other pagan peoples, especially the Babylonians: 'Aholah played the harlot when she was mine' (i.e., the Lord's); and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours... with all their idols she defile d herself... Neither left she her whore- THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGU LATORY REFORM ACT 2006 As soon as Tony Blair was elected leader of the L abour Party, he removed Clause 4 from the Party's Constitution (that is, he rejected nationalisation), courted big business, embraced the cor-poratist- collectivist European Union (having stood in Beaconsfield in 1983 on a ticket of exit from the EEC altogether), and, in power, passed legislation to control elections and electoral funding (with the exception of funding by trade unions). Blair can be described as a corporatist, in the European tradition. No other Prime Minister in history has at tended Parliament so rarely or has exhibited such contempt for the democratic process. This corresponds to the llluminati's underlying contempt for democracy, which is viewed as simply an interim stage towards the objective of the correlation of forces, resources and assets into the hands of the controlling 'brethren'. The most brazen of all assaults on the democratic system in Britain was placed before the Westminster Parliament in the first quarter of 2006, called the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill. This gives Ministers unfettered power to alter any law passed by Parliament. There are two cosmetic limitations: first, new crimes cannot be 'created' if the penalty for them is greater than two years in jail; and secondly, taxation cannot be increased. But any other law can be changed by regulation, no matter how important. All Ministers will need to do is to propose an order, wait a few weeks: and voila, the law will have been change d. Ministers will no longer need to at tend tedious debates in which they have to answer awkward questions. No amendments to th e proposed orders will be allowed. The bill replaces an existing law that 'allows' Ministers to relieve regulatory burdens. Naturally, though, the law enables Ministers to create extra regulation, including new crimes, and to change the structure of Government itself. Any body created by statute, including local authorities, the Courts and even companies, will be liable to find themselves reorganised or even abolished. Since the powers of the House of Lords are defined by Act of Parliament even they are subject to the Bill. The Bill even applies to itself. Under cover of double-minded socialism, the llluminati arranged for a fascist Government to pass its own Enabling Act as in Nazi Germany in 1933. And the business sector was all in favour. ■"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"434 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan doms brought from Egypt', where the object of worship was death. 'And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she (Aholah)': in other words, those of the City of David, which the Lord had chosen to 'dwell therein' as we are told in Scripture, became more corrupt even than those Jews who had intermarried with their pagan neighbours. And to conclude the imagery which conclusively reveals WHY 'Masonry is Jewish', Ezekiel tells us:' Then I saw that she was defiled. And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermillion, Girded with girdles upon their loins... all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity then my mind was alienated from her, as my mind was alienated from her sister. Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt' 13 . In other words, the abominations that the children of Israel learned and participated in before they were 'led out of the darkness towards the light' (the whole story of Exodus being a giant living 'real life' spiritual metaphor), made them inclined and prone to latch on and vulnerable to the abominations, sorcery and devilry that they were surrounded with during their Babylonian captivity, during and after which many of them learned all about, and practiced, the sorcery of the Kabbalah. So the statement that 'Masonry is Jewish' actually means that Masonry has been permeated, polluted and impregnated with the abominations derived by the Jews from the captivity from Babylon, and elaborated by those Jews who have remained spiritually bound in the same satanic captivity to this day - with extremely shallow lip-service being paid in Masonic ritual to the pre-Babylonian Torah of the children of Israel. Those Jews, led by Ezra, Nehemiah and other great followers of the Lord, who returned from the captivity to Jerusalem and, as prophesied by Isaiah 14 , rebuilt the city, are likewise a metaphor for those whom True Christia ns refer to as 'the remnant' - who believe in and know the Lord Jesus Christ. The rest of Jewry sank into the diversionary byways of Talmudic (Kabbalistic) Judaism, which knows no truth since every phrase of the Torah and other Jewish literature is subject to, as rabb inical scholars insist, 49 different rabbinical interpretations - which means that there is no trut h at all, everything is relative, and 'truth' is whichever rabbinical invention or mental exer cise 'satisfies' the 'seeker after truth' at any given point in time 15 . THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH LEADS WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD Thus Freemasonry is 'Jewish' in the sens e specifically and exclusively that it is Kabbalistic, and practices the reprobate sorcery of the Kabbalah. Although there are of course Jewish Lodges and many Jews are Masons (most unwisely, given that, of all peoples, they should know better - so that the punishment they are apt to suffer for such waywardness is always the more painful), Masonry does not have any resonance or affiliation with the revelation of the Word of God; and, as such, it is a false, diversionary a nd exclusively Luciferian invention which exists to intervene in as many lives as possible so as to preclude the lost souls in question from seeking and finding the Lord. In this context it is important, for anyone who is 'listening', to be aware that the Devil is not interested in being worshipped (as some deluded lost souls imagine), since he is interested only in death and destruction. If he were interested in being worshipped, he would not be so keen on destroying his targets, since they become unable to worship him. He can create nothing outside the realm of sorcery: he can only destroy."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 435 Since we know not least that the only Name to which Evil Spirit will respond and of whom it (both singular and plural) is terrified, is that of Jesus Christ, we know for certain that Jesus Christ is true and 'as adve rtised'; and since He is the Way, the Truth and the Life, his enemy, Satan, 'that old serpent', is Death. Satan's preoccupation, apart from delivering his product, is not, therefore, to be worshipped: it is to blight the lives of as many human beings as possible so as to prevent them from seeking, finding, and worshipping the Lord. Those who seek Lucifer and attempt to worship him, find themselves trapped and locked inside the fast train to Hades - which is why it was perversely and tragically logical for Jews to be packed by the Goyim, like cattle, into cattle or goods railcars en ro ute to the gas chambers. Some analysts assert, not wi thout understandable reason, that Freemasonry itself is and represents the Synagogue of Satan - a momentous description used by Jesus Christ, as revealed to his discipl e and Apostle John. This Ch apter will show that this interpretation is probably in complete. Jesus refers to th e Synagogue of Satan twice in Revelation, and on both occasions states that t hose of the Synagogue of Satan 'say they are Jews, and are not'. Specifically, at Chapter 2, verse 9, Jesus says: 'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan' 16 ; and at Chapter 3, verse 9, Jesus refers to 'them of the Synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie' 17 . THE CURSE OF DOUBLE-MINDEDNESS AGAIN Part of the explanation of Christ's allusion to participants of the Synagogue of Satan, which 'say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie' is explained thus by Friedrich Nietsche: The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be at any price: this price involved a radical falsification of all nature, of all naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world, as well as of the outer.... One by one they distorted religion, civilisation, morality, history, and psychology, until each became a contradiction of its natural significance'. Ni etsche could have added that the Pharisees, progenitors of Talmudic Zionist Fascism, demand that 'enemies are to be ruthlessly hated', whereas Jesus Christ teaches ' unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, Bless them that curse you, a nd pray for them which despitefully use you' [Luke, Chapter 6, verses 27-28]. So who, then are 'them of the Synagogue of Satan'? In the careful words of US analyst Craig Heimbichner, the mentality described by Nietsche 'survived as... a religion of the Double Mind, gradually named Ju daism. It gathered European converts from the 8th century Kingdom of Khazaria [see page 473 et seq..), forming the basis of the impostor \"Jews' spoken of [by Christ] in Revelation, Chapter 2, verse 9 - the Khazars who say they are Jews and are not. This racial masquerade complements a Judaic mentality of duplicity and falsification which was then carried into Christendom, sewing the seeds [of] the contradictions which are at the heart of... modern culture'. Jesus Christ expounded against the Jews' habitual double-mindedness, so apparent throughout the Old Te stament. This Jewish tradition of deceitful double-mindedness, most conspicuously first manifested when Aaron himself created the Golden Calf in the wilderness for the Israelites to worship and to dance around naked, even while his brother Moses was on Mount Sinai receiv ing the Ten Commandments from God, has proved infectious and has been spread pe rversely through Freemasonry, the hegem-"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"436 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan ony of secret societies (synarchy) and the co ntrolling structures of Khazarian Illuminist 'New Ageism', to permeate the whole of society. A glaring example is the reprobate, double- minded attitude prevailing in contem- porary Britain towards homosexuality, which is roundly warned against in Scripture (Leviticus Chapter 18, verse 22; Chapter 20, ver se 13; Romans Chapter 1, verse 27; and First Corinthians Chapter 6, verses 9-10). On the one hand, criticism of and opposition to this perverse practice is officially condemned to the point of being considered virtually a criminal offence, while on the other hand the prurient media are in the habit of seeking to expose any politician (and there are many) who seeks vain prominence while disguising his homosexuality from his constituen ts and the public generally. After such exposure, the argument is then routinely inverted, with the 'line' that a person's private life is their own affair and cannot be deemed liable to affect his or her performance as a Member of Parliament. This flexible morality-cum-double-mindedness, worse than hypocrisy, has become almost un iversal, in multiple contexts*. But Jesus Christ taught that 'thine eye be single' (Matthew Chapter 6, verse 22; Luke Chapter 11, verse 34), meaning that we must choose and be consistent in the Word of Truth. DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE 'PROTOCOLS' CONTROVERSY This controversial document entitled 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' was incorporated in a Russian language work published in ar ound 1905 by a certain Professor Nilus, who attempted to interpret 'The Protocols' by refere nce to events then materialising in Russia. In a series of articles published ('notoriously') by Henry Ford in his newspaper \"The Dearborn Independent' in 1920-22, the American industrialist, who had studied 'The Protocols', realised that their provenance was wholly uncertain, not least because they carried no indication of authorship or signatures. He argued (correctly) that 'the internal evidence makes it clear that 'The Protocols' were not written by a Russ ian, nor originally in the Russian language, nor under the influence of Russian conditions' 18 , despite the fact that Ni lus' edition 'gave [the document] a Russian tinge which has been usef ul to Jewish propagandists in this country [United States] and in England' 19 . \"The Protocols' 'found their way to Russia and were first published there. They have been found by diplomatic officers in manuscript in all parts of the world' 20 . Using his acute powers of analysis, to try to understand why this wholly unprovenanced document had remained the object of such widespread attention and interest, Henry Ford elaborated: 'Wherever Jewish power is able to do so, it has suppressed them, sometimes under the supreme penalty. Their persistence is a fact which challenges the mind. Jewish apologists may explain that persistence on the ground th at \"The Protocols' feed the anti-Semitic temper, and therefore are preserved for that service. Certainly there was no wide nor deep anti-Semitic temper in the United States to be fed or that felt the greed for agreeable lies to keep itself alive. The progress of 'The Protoc ols' in the United States can only be explained on the ground that they supply light and give meaning to certain previously observed facts, and that this light and meaning is so startling as to give a certain standing and importance to these otherwise unaccredited documents. Sheer lies do not * For instance, faced with confirmation and proof, publicised by the Author and a colleague in October 2005, that the European Union Treaties have been routinely procured by means of corrupt payments and are therefore null and void under Article 49 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on Treaties, the entire British media, which normally exposes corr uption in order to fill its pages, having been advised in detail of this abomination through the Author's publication International Currency Review (V olume 30, #4], chose en masse (in accordance wi th long-st anding 'instruc tions', to keep the British people in ignorance), to ignore the whole matter. In so doing, the journalists concerned robbed themselves of all residual moral standing and credibility, since they demonstrated by their indifference to these scandals that they have no objection to the rampant corruption of governance, which is the primary product of this crisis. Yet the same journalists are indeed forever frenetically and venally digging up dirt on targeted public and privat e figures to whom they may have taken a disliking, for some ephemeral reason or other.

These 'Protocols' are more alive than ever'. 'The Protocols' would not be more worthy of study if they bore the name of Theodore Hertzl [founder of modern Zionism ]. Their anonymity does not decrease their power any more than the omission of a painter's sign ature detracts from the art value of a painting' 21 . Henry Ford's acknowledgment that the Protocols are anonymous, is important. He states that 'The Protocols' are a World Program - there is no doubt anywhere of that. Whose program, is stated within the Articles themselves. But as for outer confirmation, which would be the more valuable - a signature, or six signatures, or twenty signatures. ..?' There are none 22 . This implies that Ford thought he knew who was behind \"The Protocols', whereas at the same time he admits to remaining baffled. In further argumentation, Henry Ford wrestled with the issue of 'The Protocols\" authorship, noting the distinction made therein between those referred to in the document alternatively as 'the Gentiles' and as Goyim ('cattle'), and 'we', which appears to mean 'we Jews'. Thus, 'We Jews will do this', but 'The Gentiles will be made to do and think these things' 23 . It is \"we\" for the writers', says Ford , 'and \"Gentiles\" for those who are being written about. This is brought out very clearly in the Fourteenth Protocol: \"'In this divergence between the Gentiles and ourselves in ability to think and reason is to be seen clearly the seal of our election as the chosen people, as higher human beings, in contrast with the Gentiles who have merely instinctive and animal minds. They observe, but they do not foresee.... It is clear from this that nature herself predestinated us to rule and guide the world\". But who is 'us'? A copy of this document was deposited in the British Museum on 10th August 1906. On 25th June 1920, Herman Bernstein wrot e as follows in 'The American Hebrew': \"About a year ago, a representative of the Department of Justice submitted to me a copy of the manuscript of 'The Jewish Peril' by Professor Nilus, and asked for my opinion of the work. He said that the manuscript was a translation of a Russian book published in 1905 which was later suppressed. The manuscript was supposed to contain 'Protocols' of the Wise Men of Zion and was supposed to have been read by Dr Herzl at a secret conference of the Zionist Congress at Basle. He expressed the opinion that the work was probably that of Dr Theodore Herzl.... He said that some American Senators who had seen the manuscript were amazed to fi nd that so many years ago a scheme had been elaborated by the Jews which is now being carried out, and that Bolshevism had been planned years ago by Jews who sought to destroy the world\" 24 . MAKES SENSE IF ALL REFERENCES TO THE GOYIM ARE REMOVED The document was thought by Henry Ford and others to represent alternatively a collection of lecture notes for students, which Ford said 'probably dated from 1896, or the year' when Dr Herzl made some public observations about his Zionist project. The first Zionist Congress was convened in 1887. 'In their present form, which bears evidence of being their original form, there is no contradiction. The allegation of Jewish authorship seems essential to the consistency of the plan'. And yet, Henry Ford wrote: 'If these documents were the forgeries which Jewish apologists claim them to be, the forgers would probably have taken pains to make Jewish authorship so clear that thei r anti-Semitic purpose could easily have been detected. But only twice is the term \"Jew\" used in them' 25 . This consideration brought Henry Ford close to unveiling the hidden truth of the matter, for he was correctly dubious that the documents are of Jewish origin: 'Who was it', he asked, 'that first entitled these documents with the name of the \"Elders of Zion\","},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"438 C HAPTER 7. The Synagogue of Satan is not known. It would be possible without serious mutilation of the documents to remove all hints of Jewish authorship, and yet retain all the main points of the most comprehensive program for world subjugation that has ever come to public knowledge' 26 . Precisely. If references to the Goyitn are rem oved, and the questionable assumption that the \"we\" and the \"us\" represent the Jews, the integrity of the document remains unvi-olated. In other words, The Protocols' represent THE CLASSIC INTELLIGENCE 'SIB' OPERATION, whereby a target's reputation is 'Blackened', so that the target itself can be blamed for abominations planned for the benefit of 'others'; and when the target has been fully exploited, its can be destroyed ('the Holocaust'). Yet Henry Ford also vacillated between concluding that the document's authorship was Jewish, and that it was not. It seems that his main problem was that he could not imagine whose the authorship could be if it was not that of Jewish forces: 'Yet it must be said that to eliminate all hint of Jewish authorship would be to bring out a number of contradictions which do not exist in 'The Protocols' in their present form . And so, having perceived (correctly) that if all hints of Jewish authorship were removed, the coherence of the documents would remain unaffected, Henry Ford abandoned the search, and fell back, more or less, on the assumption that authorship of 'The Protocols' must be Jewish. The reason he did so has already been revealed: he found himself, in 1927, under extreme pressure from a group of (Jewish-owned) car dealerships to renounce any suggestion that 'The Protocols' were of Jewish origin, on pain of having his marketing operation for a new Ford car sabotaged. Actually, a moment's thought would reveal that this was an empty threat, since the dealers' own livelihoods would have been adversely affected by any such commercial sabotage: but it is reliably believed that, facing the need for an immediate decision so as not to destabilise the marketing plan, he succumbed, and consequently distanced himself from all his earlier conclusions and research. Had Henry Ford perhaps been more familiar with Scripture in general, and with the Book of Revelation in particular, he would pr obably not have remain ed semi-deceived. For Revelation Chapter 2, verse 9 and Chapter 3, verse 9, provide us with the authority to be able to make the following assertion Jewish antagonists have been partially correct to condemn the documents as a 'forgery', from their perspective. But it would have been more accurate to describe 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' as a blueprint for world conquest and control slanted, as has been proposed, so that the Jews would be blamed, and in order to provide cover for the true perpetrators - our TRUE enemies, the Kabbalistic Illuminati. These are they, indeed, who are 'of the Synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews and are not, but do lie' 28 . These are the Nazi-type \"we\" and the \"us\", who have never had any problem excoriating the Jews, using the Jews as scap egoats, and ensuring that their own appalling sins, scams and abominations are blamed by the Goyim on the Jews. The logic of this deduction (which will be reinforced later) is of course that the Holocaust would have represented no more than 'collateral damage' for these people. It should, accordingly, hardly surprise us that the mind-set which prescribed that the Jews have plotted for millennia against those whom some of them call the Gentiles, the cattle, should have reaped the perennial vengeance of the Goyim themselves, in the fo rmat of pogroms down the centuries, and the Holocaust of the Third Reich. Thus far, therefore, identification of 'The Protocols' authorship as being that of the Illuminati, a collaborative 'cutout' for the Jewish Kahal, seems entirely consistent with the facts. Moreover Henry Ford could take the argument no further, for the reason already mentioned - namely, that he had no other culp rit who could readily be identified as the"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 439 source of the brains behind 'The Protocols'. Instead, Henry Ford found that he could merely point to 'the people against whom the plan is aimed'. The document 'is aimed against the people of the world who are called \"Gentiles\". It is the frequent mention of \"Gentiles\" that really decides the purpose of the documents.... This plan aims at the degeneration of the people in order that they may be reduced to confusion of mind and thus manipulated. Popular movements of a \"liberal\" kind are to be encouraged, all the disruptive philosophies in religion, economics, politics and domestic life are to be sown and watered, for the purpose of so disintegrating social solidarity that a definite plan, herein set forth, may be put through without notice, and the people then moulded to it when the fallacy of these philosophies is shown' 29 . Does this, by any chance, sound at all familiar? Take the language, cited on page 430, about the corruption of children, from Protocol 9, which explicitly states that, even t hough the perpetrators know that what they intend is wrong, our children are to be corrupted (contrary to the commandment of Jesus Christ for whom the corruption of children is a sin so heinous that the perpetrators deserve to have a heavy weight tied around their necks and to be thrown from cliffs into the depths of the sea): 'We have fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth of the Goyim rearing them in principles and theories which are known to us to be false although it is by us that they have been inculcated' 30 . History shows that Henry Ford was an inspired prophet. MORE MANIFESTATIONS OF 'THE SEETHING ENERGIES OF LUCIFER' Which evil minds thought and wrote this, those of the Illuminati authors, or that of Lavrentii Beria? The question is posed rhetorical ly, in order to bring us yet closer to the truth. As previously divulged, Beria was a German operative functioning at the highest levels of the first 'Black' Illuminati regime of the 20th century, that of the Soviet Union, which had been facilitated by the German intelligence agent, Rasputin. Hence, it is no coincidence that Beria's prescription for our our children 'just happens' to be identical to the repulsive assertion of evil intent to corrupt Gentile children contained in Protocol 9. It will be recalled - from page 174 et seq. - that Lavren tii Beria's prescription included instructions such as the following: 'By making readily available drugs of various kinds, by giving the teenager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulating him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol, the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of ch aos, idleness and worthlessness.... The psychopolitical operator can instruct, in an optimum situation, the entire nation in how to handle children - and instruct them so that the children, given no control, given no real home, can run wildly about with no responsibility for their nation or for themselves.... Creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbehavi our and uncontrolled freedom... will with ease bring about our alignment' *. This Illuminati strategy has been relentlessly and ruthlessly applied by the British and American educational authorities as a direct consequence of the hidden penetration of German Illuminati Fifth Column operatives. The consistency of this assessment with the prevailing phase of revolutionary terrorism needs to be considered 31 . As noted, in the 1920s, German intelligence established the Muslim Brotherhood, based in Cairo, as a mechanism for the destabilisation of * From 'Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics', or 'the art and science of asserting and maintain ing dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, structures, and masses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through \"mental healing\"', now referred to as 'mental mapping'; with an address by Lavrentii Beria; extracted from the 'Communist Manual of Instructions of Psychopolitical Warfare', used in the training of Communist cadres in the United States in the 1930s, and exposed by the former American Communist, Kenneth Goff. See also Chapter 3. False 'consensus' training was being disseminated in 2005-06 to cadres of 'Useful Idiots' in Britain through a brainwashing operation directed from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the neo-Bolshevik John Prescott, called 'Common Purpose' (the terms of which are left undefined)."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"440 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan British power in the Middle East, and thus as a means of preparing the ground for German access to the oil resources of the Caucasus (Baku, in Azerbaijan) and elsewhere. The German Geopolitical Centre established by the Nazi International in Madrid spawned other Nazi International Centres, notably in Rome, Buenos Aires and Cairo, from which the Nazis continued and expanded their ongoing destabilisation activities through the Muslim Brotherhood and its clones. Outline details of Adolf Eichmann's secret visit to Palestine in 1936, and its grim conseque nces, are summarised in the box on page 547. With the exception of the extensive Soviet terrorism training and proliferation operations - spun from the Tricontinental Conference sponsored by the KGB held in Cuba in January 1966, which launched a network of terrorism training camps on the outskirts of Havana that were supervised by a KGB Colonel, Va dim Kotchergine - it is a fact that all radicalised Islamic terrorism organisations are the offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood. German and Russian intelligence work 'competitively' together [see Conclusion, page 617]. These Islamic organisations, and the immense revolutionary infrastructure that supports them with destabilisation propaganda (such as Palestinian Radio and TV which is indistinguishable from overt Soviet-era anti-Western hate broadcasting) feast on hatred of the Jews. That this is so, reflects the poison of anti-Semitism sown by the German Illuminati in the text of their 'Protocols' which, as discussed, are slanted so as to appear having been authored by high-ranking internationalist Jews. It is surely not hard to perceive the demonic attraction and force that such propaga nda was calculated to exert in the simple minds of prospective Islamic jihadists whose minds have been prepared for martyrdom by the demonic proposition that they will be rewarded in heaven by the services of 70 virgins. Minds so diverted from reality and the truth by such fairytales, would be equally susceptible to the 'attractive' notion that the usurping Jews, who allegedly control the United States, are the source of all the evils imported from the d ecadent West that are perceived to afflict the Muslim world. And the decadence of the West is itself a product of the Uluminati, against which the deceived, primitive Islamists are comprehensively indoctrinated to react. THE 'PERMANENT REVOLUTION' SI NCE THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST For it is indeed as though Lucifer himself had devised the hellish mixture of pressures and deceptions that have engulfed millions of Is lamic minds. For, as anyone who has eyes to see knows, Jews are universally prominen t throughout the Western 'entertainment' industry, which Muslims rightly identify as an open sepulchre of decadence and filth that is being poured into the minds of people everywhere. Given this prominence, the hate propaganda plotted by the Uluminati, when, to hide their authorship, they skewed their evil blueprint for global control so that it would appear to have been drafted by Jews, 'enjoys' poisonously fertile soil upon which to grow and thrive. Against this background, the seething hatred for Jews which characterises Islam -a product of the 'seething energies of Lucifer' - is perhaps easier to understand, especially since Muslim culture has remained, until scarcely more than a few decades ago, in many respects rooted in the 7th century AD. Nor did the 'ownership' of the Russian Revolution by Jews diminish the popular conviction, as much among Muslims as in ot her communities around the world, that the Jews are the source of all evil. A minority of hyperactivist Jews implemented, both wittingly and unknowingly on behalf of the controlling Uluminati, the horrors of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath - as summarised, in part, in the Author's intel-"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 441 ligence publication Soviet Analyst [Volume 29, #s 8-10], which contained a directory of prominent Jewish revolutionary activists. In this context, the Author acknowledges a debt to Dr Henry Mackow who, in a 2005 analysis of 'The Red Symphony' - the text of a Stalinist Secret Police (NKVD) pre-execution interrogation of Chaim Rakover (a.k.a. Christian Rakovsky), a Soviet Ambassador who had formerly been a very close associate of Rothschild's agent, Leon Trotsky - noted Rakover's assertion that 'Communism ca nnot triumph unless it suppresses the 'still living' Christianity'. This claim was vehemently reaffirmed by the Jewish Illuminist President Mikhail Gorbachev on 15th December 1987, when addressing a group of Communist Party cadres, officials and Soviet military personnel in Uzbekistan: 'There must be no let-up in the war against religion, because as long as religion exists Communism cannot prevail. We must intensify the obliteration of all religions wherever they are being practiced or taught'. Chaim Rackover then referred to the 'Permanent Revolution' - which was always thought to have been the evil Trotsky's invention - as dating from the birth of Christ, adding that 'in reality, Christianity is our only real enemy since... Christianity controlling the individual is capable of annulling the revolu tionary projection of the neutral Soviet or atheist State'. Extracting this statement from its redundant historical context, the crucial truth revealed here is that this late 'Devil' knew who Jesus Christ was - and, moreover, knew that He was 'the enemy' from his birth, rather than from his Crucifixion and Resurrection. To make this distinction require s considerable understanding of the reality that Jesus Christ was and is the enemy of evildoers from the beginning - which Chaim Rakover, though a Jewish Communist friend of the demonic Trotsky, knew perfectly well, not least because he was an educated Jew. And why was this? Because 'the devils also believe, and tremble' [James, Chapter 2, verse 19]. They know, indeed, that 'Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and is come in the flesh' [First Epistle of John , Chapter 4, verses 1-3], but reject what they know and 'confess Him not'. Echoes of Rackover's understanding are replicated by possessed 'High Revolutionaries' today. For instance, Brock Chisholm, a former director of the UN World Health Organisation, pronounced that 'To achieve One-World Government, it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism, their loyalty to family traditions and national identification'. In other words, the natural (divine) order is to be defied, and turned upside down. Chaim Rakover's acknowledgement that the 'Permanent Revolution' began with the birth of Christ is of immense significance and help to us in our search for an explanation of 'the mystery of iniquity' [Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, Chapter 2, verse 7]; indeed, this admission justifies Rackover's bad life. That Christianity - the enemies of which choose not to tell the difference between its earthly perversions and True Christianity, of course, since they mistakenly confus e the decadent and compromised Christian churches for the 'real thing' - is 'the only enemy' of all Luciferians, itself confirms the uniqueness of Jesus Christ and why it is only in His Name, that devils are cast out; and if devils can only be cast out in His Name, other names are not of the Lord, but of Satan: 'But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house di vided against itself shall not stand; And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?' [Matthew, Chapter 12, verses 24-26].

Sensible people trying to live their lives constructively do not devote time and resources without end, in seeking to destroy all 'religion' (meaning Christianity): such behaviour is akin to a form of demonic possessi on. And that is exactly what we are dealing with as we consider the otherwise inexplicable perpetuation of the 'Permanent Revolution' lasting for two millennia so far, which today is driven extensively by the 'Orders' of the Illuminati. To know, from a deceased Communist Jew, that our enemies are well aware that Jesus Christ is the one and only enemy, and has been considered as such since His very birth, is surely a revelation sent to encourage us all. For this statement is not speculative: it was made by the Jew Chaim Rakover as he faced execution. And the fact that this revelation h as been brought to our attention by Dr Mackow, who is himself of Jewish extraction, gives it the greater force: as he concluded in his analysis, 'G od is more powerful than the satanic forces that hold mankind in their thrall. But His Will cannot be done unless men do it. Whatever the cost, the cost of not doing it will be greater'. The present work seeks - by exposing and attempting however inadequately and incompletely - to explain the source of the evils we face, to enable others to resolve to face up to these 'Illuminated' Ones. And here is a remarkable fact: if, knowing the truth, you resist them so that they know you see thr ough them, a remarkable thing happens. They shrink from you. Incredibly, 'get thee behind me Satan' is no idle order. It works. GERMAN JEWISH ROSICRUCIAN ORIGINS OF THE MODERN ILLUMINATI The foundation of the modern manifestation of the sect of the Dlumina ti in Germany is well known to have been primarily the work of the lapsed Jesuit priest, Professor Adam Weishaupt, of Ingolstadt University. Not only wa s Weishaupt a former Jesuit (and therefore Illuminati-trained pupil) of Jewish extraction, but Moses Mendelssohn, head of the Haskalah, or always pre-existing Jewish Illuminati, co operated closely with the Bavarian Illuminati headed by Weishaupt, as well as with prom inent members of the other secret societies aspiring to seize political power. These secret societies, represented within the burgeoning Masonic movement, organised two Great Masonic Conventions in the late 18th century - that held at Les Gaules in 1768, and the Great Masonic Convention, or Convent, of Wilhelmsbad in 1782, at which the delegates voted, in accordance with the demands of their demonic 'spirit guides', we are told, for the death of the King of France. The occult Rosicrucians, who have usurped, conquered and now reside both within and beyond Freemasonry, which has been reorganised several times primarily at their instigation, are central to this investigation. First, these people, sorcerers and alchemists, claimed to be the recipients by tradition of esoteric knowled ge from the ancient Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Magi and the Gymnosophists. Secondly, they rejected the teachings of the Catholic Church, using the understandable revulsion at the Church's abominations and abusive arrogance as their pretext for rejecting Christianity. Thirdly, the Rosicrucians themselves were explicitly called the Illuminati, as was confirmed in the third edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' of 1797, which st ated: 'They [the Rosicrucians] have been distinguished by several names, accommodated to the several branch es of their doctrine. Because they pretend to protect [and to extend - Ed.] the period of human life, by means of certain nostrums, and even to restore youth, they were called Immortals; as they pretended to know all things, they have been called Illuminati; and because they have made no appearance for several years, unless the sect of"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 443 Illuminated [Ones] which lately started up on the Continent derives its origin from them, they have been called the Invisible Brothers' 32 (see below). Finally, the same authoritative source from 1797 asserts that they arose, or first emerged into prominence in the modern era, in Germany: 'Rosicrucians, a name assumed by a sect or cabal of hermetical philosophers; who arose, as it has been said, or at least became first taken notice of in Germany, in the beginning of the fourteenth century' 33 . The sect was formally established in England by Francis Bacon, the author of 'Nova Atlantis' (1624), whom Manly P. Hall asserts in his rare work to be Valentin Andrea, who was appointed preacher to the Duke of Brunswick Wolfebbuttel in 1640, according again to the Encyclopaedia Britannica 34 - leaving us necessarily confused as to whether it really seems likely that a man as influential as Sir Francis Bacon would have accepted such a post, even had he still been alive in 1640. This possible confusion provides an interesting example of the problems facing researchers who have to contend with the reality that these people, seized with the 'seething energies of Lucifer' , were and remain past-masters of deception and secrecy. Indeed, it was formally agreed at the Rosicrucians' Convention of the Seven at Magdebourg on 31st October 1617 that the Brotherhood of the Rose Croix must maintain the strictest secrecy for 100 years. The source for this information is a Rosicrucian book entitled 'Themis Aurea', written in 1616-17 and printed in 1618, by Michael Maier, a Jew who called himself Summus Magister, or Sovereign Master , a title used in Rose-Croix documents preserved in the Sovereign Patriarchal Council of Hamburg, which is the Supreme Jewish Lodge identified by Lady Queenborough as being 'secretly affiliated to Masonry'. That expert states unequivocally, as do others, that the Rosicrucians 'conquered Freemasonry, which was officially instituted in 1717' 35 - that is to say, at the end of the hundred-year period of secrecy that the Rosicrucians agreed upon at their Convention of the Seven at Magdebourg in 1617. Why did they go underground for 100 years? Because they calculated that it would take a century to fulfil the task they set themselves of spawning the secret structures that emerged later as Masonic Lodges. Rose Croix was, all along, 'a medium for the propagation of Gnosticism' - that is to say, for the vehement hatred of and opposition to True Christianity as elaborated first by Simon Magus, and by reprobate successors such as the 17th century false Messiah, Shabbetai Tzvi - 'and a center for political activities'. In an opening chapter to her monumental work, 'Occult Theocrasy', Lady Queenborough linked Rosicrucian and all related and subsequent forms of Gnosticism directly to the apostasy of Simon Magus: 'Luciferian Occultism... is not a novelty, but it bore a different name in the early days of Christianity. It was called Gnosticism and its founder was Simon the Magician. The Gnostics were not ordinary heretics but constituted an anti-Christian sect. To deceive the multitude, they affected disagreement with certa in doctrines of the Apostles, and the chiefs selected from among the initiates those [who were] destined to receive, in secret council, the satanic revelation. Gnosticism is marked with the seal of Lucifer. It is contemporary with the Apostle Peter and has continued, without interruption, down to the present day, periodically changing its mask' 36 . Indeed, this practice of frequent 'label-changing' and reorganisation is its official, institutionalised strategy, as laid down in instructions to the seventh Illuminati Degree of Regent [see Figure 78, page 497]: The great strength of our Order lies in its con cealment; never let it appear in any place in its own name, but always covered by another name, and another occupation'. Given this routine practice, all investigations into the identity of the Illuminati are"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"444 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan deliberately hampered by a confused universe of secret societies characterised by innu- merable reorganisations and changes of title - such as the sudden emergence (page 456) of Ordo Templi Orientis related to, or mimicking, or as an offshoot of, Albert Pike's evil Palladism; or the secret workings, from an office in Switzerland that functions all the year round, of the Bilderberg Organisation, which coordinates the Illuminati's operations. Since the Illuminati have themselves officially/inadvert ently revealed their standard policy of label- changing - the formula adopted by the Soviet Communists in 1989-92, and then by 'New Labour' in Britain, which suddenly emerged as a cover for control-freak Communo- Fastism, and by 'Green Conservatism' under the Illuminati's latest robot, David Cameron - the objective analyst, while seeking the highest possible standard of accuracy, need not be over-concerned that a few threads may not appear to 'tie up'. For 'it is written' indeed that the Illuminati purposely conceal themselves and all their kabbalis-tic occultism and abominations, which they know to be wrong and to represent the certain road to perdition, in order to perpetuate maximum confusion among the 'Goyim'. EXPLOITATION OF JEWISH ANIMUS AGAINST JESUS CHRIST Unsurprisingly, therefore, given that we can precisely identify Rosi crucian sorcery with a Jewish/Babylonian source, it is no surprise to find that many hyperactive Jews were associated with the Ro sicrucians prior to their takeover or merger with Freemasonry, in addition to Michael Maier - including Cesare Cremonini, Richard Simon and Nick Stone, who influenced the Rosicrucian figure Thomas Vaughan to pursue the idea of subverting the guild of the 'physical' Freemasons, an ancient universal fraternity, to Gnosticism and sorcery, given the phasing-out of church- and cathedral-building. At the Convention of the Seven in Magdebourg, 'The Invisibles' had both sworn to destroy the church of Jesus Christ (which they confused of course with the Catholic Church) and 'to transform the fraternity into an association which would carry on more or less open propaganda, while adopting such measures of prudence as might then be deemed expedient by the sect' 37 . Why an oath was sworn to keep these intentions secret for a cen tury is not entirely clear, which suggests an occultic imperative. In the event, the decision was taken effectively to continue the Rosicrucian tradition of secrecy by means of the takeove r-merger with Freemasonry, which enabled the Rosicrucians to spread thei r sorcery and related abominations through Freemasonry from behind their preferred veil of secrecy even though a publication called 'The Rosicrucian' was flourishing in the second half of the 19th century. The last of the known Grand Masters of the Rose Croix, according to Lady Queenborough, was Johann Christian Wolff 38, of Jewish extraction. And according to a source cited by Lady Quee nborough herself, the last Grand Master of Rose Croix, who died in 1750, was another Jew, Brim 39 . Both were German. German Jews have been at the forefront of the Rosicrucian Illuminati for centuries, right down to the alleged triple or quadruple agent Dr Henry Kissinger, clearly identified by the Author's late friend Malachi Martin as the International Delegate and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary to the Enthronement of the Prince of Darkness at the Vatican [see page 374] - the 'mentor' of George Bush Sr., who is allegedly the head of Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD), Dachau, under Heinz Alfred Kissinger's guidance. Both these men allegedly control vast secretly acquired financial resources. Apart from the Rosicrucian manifestation of the perpetual 'seething energies of Lucifer', other secret societies bent upon the elevation of Gnosticism, sorcery and revolution to the forefront of the geopolitical agenda, have included:"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 445 • The Martinists, established by a Portugues e Marano Jew, Martinez Depasqualy, who indulged in magical pr actices united with political intrigue, and included among their members the leading political operatives Salvette de Lange, a Jew, William Law (d itto) and Mirabeau, who fomented the French Revolution - just as the Rosicrucian Illuminati separately prepared the ground for the American Revolution. • The Strict Observance led by Baron Hund und Leucht, of Jewish extraction, who assumed the name of Johnson and several other aliases. This secret society recruited its members from the Lodges and merged occultism with political intrigue, formulating a plan for financial / economic control based on the Babylonian fiat money system. • The Scottish Rite, the Moravian Brothers, the Alta Vendita (and/or anti-church Carbonarism, into which the Je wish Giuseppe Mazzini was initiated in 1827 and with which he merged his Young Italy Movement which shared the same objective of destroying Papal power, and was headed by a mysterious Jew called Piccolo Tigre), and the Egyptian Rites of Cagliostro (Mizraim), ostensibly founded in 1805 with 90 Degrees. Essentially Jewish, this elaborate system involved long and difficult ritual trials based on records of the Egyptian and Eleusinian occult and death myster ies. The Rite of Mizraim had in fact been amalgamated with the Rite of Memphis in 1775, for use in England. According to The Rosicrucian' for January 1871: 'We have great pleasure in announcing that this philosophic Masonic Rite (Ancient and Primitive Rite of Mizraim) has been recently established in England under an authority derived from the Grand Council of Rites for France, and that the Conservators General he ld a meeting at the Freemasons Tavern, on Wednesday, the 28th December. The principal chai rs were filled by Ill. Bros. Wentworth Little 90o; the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Limerick 90o; and S. Rosenthal (of Jewish extraction) 90o; by whom the 'Bective' Sanctuary of Levites - the 33rd of the Rite - was duly opened'. In other words, Mr Rosenthal was in charge. According to Robert Freke Gould, 'The Protocols of the Wise Men or Elders of Zion' were abstracted from a Jewish Lodge of Mizraim in Paris in 1884 by Joseph Schorst, who was later murdered in Egypt. Schorst was the son of a man who had been sentenced in 1881 in London to ten years' penal se rvitude for counterfeiting. The document was said to embody the complete programme of esoteric Judaism. More extended enquiry, beyond the scope of this analysis, would demonstrate the dialectical linkages between the Liberal Conservatism of Disraeli, and the community of ultimate interests between the Rothschilds, the Goldsmids, Karl Marx, Moses Hess and all the othe r players of Jewish extraction mentioned in this book which, Lady Queenborough asserts, 'all point towards the establishment of Jewish power. And although their respective activities seem to stand so far apart, yet they are all linked, all tending towards the same end' 40 . Lady Queenborough also explained why historians had failed to identify Illuminism with the unbroken stream of Jewish Gnosticism, sorcery and political intrigue stretching back to Simon Magus: 'Whereas in Gentile life, there is an unbridgeable abyss between Conservatism and Anarchy, Religion and Atheism, there is no such chasm in the Jewish mentality'. This reflects, inter alia, the fact that Judaism is 'religionised law'. 'There, all currents, no matter in what direction they may seem to flow, are finally united and channelled in one unique direction. It has been somewhat difficult for historians of the French Revolution to see the close link between Judaism and IUuminism; [but] we repeat that no such difficulty exists for the student of the 1848 revolutionary period .... The main difference is that the term 'Illuminism' used in the 18th century is re placed by the wide term Freemasonry which embraces all the existent secret societies', represented therein 41 ."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"446 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan MASONIC 'DUPES' NEVER IN TENDED TO UNDERSTAND The adepts and initiates of the revolutionary and occultic societies were hardly aware of these broader dimensions, let alone that they were all dupes who were and are, to modify the notorious statement by that prize sorcerer and dupe Albert Pike, not intended to understand but to imagine that they understand 42 . All they knew was that they had shaken off the 'yoke' of Christian principles, and that these were replaced 'by the cult of nature, and in almost all cases by licentiousness' 43 . The modern Illuminati heirs of these people have 'successfully' procured the hegemony of licentiousness through the free-wheeling perv ersions and license of all modern forms of 'entertainment', the electronic media and (in the United Kingdom) the conversion of the media into transmission platforms for the wholesale purveyance of decadence, the glorification of fornication an d sexual perversions of all kinds, and the ridiculing of all serious opposition to this avalanche of filth, whic h is epitomised by the reptilian repulsiveness of 'The Stones' - not to mention the British techni que of hiding dissidents such as this Author behind a 'wall of silence'. The Channel Five TV station broadcasts (usually American) filth of such degradation that it must obviously have b een concluded by the Illuminati cells operating within it, that the Goyim have been so anaesthetised that it w ill now accept any foul provocation without protest. In any case, institutionalised mechanisms exist for decisively deflecting and neutralising all criticism. Concerning the imagined 'yoke' of Christian principles, which preclude abom- inations such as the Illuminised Ones' lust after, rejection of burdens imposed by the Catholic Church upon the faithful comes'richly' from Judaic 'prophets' who maintain the Pharisaical system of petty rules and regulations. These dictate, for instance, that when, in 2000, the Author had to attend Beth Israel Hospital in New York (where he incurred a charge of $5,500 for an 18-hour stay ), he was instructed to avoid a certain elevator which, given that it was a Saturday , stopped at every floor because one of the Talmudic Jews' 613 'rules' states that pressing an elevator button on the Sabbath is 'work', which is forbidden on that day (superstition, of course) Alternativel y, an egg cannot be eaten, according to Rabbinical wisdom, on the Sabbath if most of it was laid before the appearance of the second star in the sky. By contrast, the 'yoke' of Jesus Christ is light indeed: 'Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light' 44 . LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT SHED BY BENJAMIN DISRAELI At this point, Benjamin Disraeli comes to our rescue. He does so in his novel 'Coningsby', published 45 in London in 1844, in which he drew a picture, from observed life, of Jews ruling the world from behind thrones - a picture as graphic as is suggested by The Protocols'. In one passage, a Ro thschild (thinly disguised under the name Sidonia) says: 'You never observe a great intellectual movement in Europe in which the Jews do not greatly participate. The first Jesuits were Jews'. Ignatius Loyola, while a student at Salamanca in 1527, was tried by an ecclesiasti cal commission (prior to Loyola's own later establishment of the Papal repression apparat) for sympathy with a sect called 'The Illuminati' or the 'Alombrados', founded in about 1520 - but was acquitted with an admonition. This might explain, then, the perverse fervour with which Ignatius Loyola set about developing the Inquisition, which, as a Jew, he would have known would, over time, trigger such accumulated animosity towards the Church that it would become easier to destroy, or else (as was finally decided) to subvert it from within, en route to its"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 447 conversion into the Universal Church of Man. And Disraeli is enlightening, too, on the intimate connection between Jews and German sorcerers in this endeavour: \"That mysterious Russian diplomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organised and principally carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution (1848)... is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews, who almost mono polise the professorial chairs of Germany; Neander, founder of spiritual Christianity [sic] and who is Regius professor of Divinity in the University of Berlin, is a Jew. Benary, equally famous, and in the same University, is a Jew. Wehl, the Arabic Professor of Heidelberg, is a Jew. Years ago, when I was in Palestine, I met a German student who was accumulating materials for the history of Christianity and studying the genius of the place; a modest a nd learned man. It was Wehl; then unknown, since become the first Arabic scholar of the da y, and the author of the life of Mahomet. But for the German professors of this race, their na me is legion. I think there are more than ten in Berlin alone' 46 . Since the famous Victorian Jewish Prime Minister of Great Britain could hardly be a more impeccable source, a further paragraph fr om 'Coningsby', in which the author talks about Rothschild (Sidonia) criss-crossing Europe to make loans to potentates, and in which he alludes to the 'protective Christianisation' of Jews in Spain, is relevant: 'A few years back we were applied to by Russia [for a loan - Ed.].... I resolved to go to St Petersburg. I had on my arrival an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance, Count Canrin. I beheld the son of a Lithuanian Jew. The loan was connected with the affairs of Spain; I resolved on repairing to Spain from Russia. I travelled without intermission. I had an audience immediately on my arrival with the Spanish Minister, Senor Mendizabel; I beheld one like myself, the son of a Nuevo Christiano, a Jew of Aragon. In consequence of what transpired in Madrid, I went straight to Paris to consult the President of the French Counci l; I beheld the son of a French Jew...'. [Back in Northern Europe, in Prussia]. 'Count Arnim entered the Ca binet [room], and I beheld a Prussian Jew. So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes' 47 . THE EARLIER SPANISH VERSION OF THE PROTOCOLS' In 1492, the Chief Rabbi of Spain, Chemor, wrote to the Grand Sanhedrin, which then had its seat in Constantinople, asking for high-level advice in the face of a Spanish law which threatened all Jews with expulsion. The reply he received, shown in Figures 68A and 68B on pages 449 and 451, was published in a 16th Century Spanish work entitled 'La Silva Curiosa', with the following explanation: 'This letter following was found in the archives of Toledo by the Hermit of Salamanca, (while) searching the ancient records of the Kingdoms of Spain; and, as it is expressive and remarkable, I wi sh to write it here'. The text in question represents an earlier version of a Jewish 'draft plan of action' of which, authorities claim, 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' is a later manifestation: \"Beloved brethren in Moses, we have receive d your letter in which you tell us of the anxieties and misfortunes which you are enduring. We are pierced by as great a pain to hear it as yourselves. The advice of the Gran d Satraps and Rabbis is the following: 1.

Signed: 'Prince of the Jews of Constantinople' 48 . We may now be closer to understanding wh y it is possible to delete all Jewish ref- erences and connotations from the text of 'The Protocols', as translated from the Russian of Nilus, and to conclude that the text represents the blueprint of the Illuminati for the achievement of global hegemony. The point is that, as with the analogy of rats in a sack, these people invariably work at cross-purposes and fall out with each other. Moreover the Jews are themselves woefully divided, ev en though they are bound together by a single Messianic idea and also in certain cases by a ha tred of Christianity which arises from their deep subconscious awareness that they 'mis sed the boat' when Christ was crucified, although large numbers of Jews were converted both then and afterwards: for these people are anything but stupid. But the dear Jewess who told the youthful, naive Author that 'a Jew's greatest enemy is another Jew' , said it all. For the reality is that while the great idea binds them together, they are often permanently at loggerheads with each other along the way. And since this is the norm, it is no surprise that 'The Protocols' were drafted in such a way that, if all reference to Jewish ideas and language is removed, they read like the prospectus for the Illuminati's World Revolution which those who have not studied the matter might imagine is a venture that is entirely 'free-standing'. THE PALLADIAN RITE - A GOVERNING GEOMASONIC CONTROL CENTRE Since the Society of Jesus was indeed founde d by a Jew, and the Rosicrucian conquest of Freemasonry was a Jewish operation, the ka bbalistic sorcery and Satanism which charac- terises Freemasonry is indisputably, as ke y Jewish authorities themselves acknowledge, Jewish. The innumerable recruits to the secret societies in the 18th century, who had de facto abandoned Christianity and had given themselves over to the cult of nature and to licentiousness, were, as thei r heirs are today, dupes knowingly manipulated by hidden (partly Jewish) forces dedicated to the destruction of Christianity (an impossible task) and to the disruption of St ates - forces for whom all the secret societies and Orders were simply recruiting grounds. When the power and influenc e of these secret societies threatened to become uncontrollable, and had grown to such an extent that discipline was judged necessary, the 'Invisible' masters, the mainly Jewish Rosicrucian cont rollers, took steps to impose 'unity' upon the huge numbers of rats that had bred in the sack of iniquity - a step that was achieved when the secret societi es and Lodges were united under the umbrella of universal Illuminism at the Convent of Wilhelmsbad in 1782. Today, many prominent Freemasons are initiates of parallel Orders and hold multiple Masonic ranks, as well as belonging to one or more parallel secret societies hiding behind Illuminist Freemasonry. As a consequence, a stubborn Luciferian interlocking directorate or nexus has long since develope d which this Author believes to represent the single most grievous impediment to peace on earth and the salvation of mankind, and the primary source of corruption, institutiona lised double-mindedness, lies and"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 449 Figure 68A: In 1492, Chemor, the Chief Rabbi of Spain, wrote to the Grand Sanhedrin, which then had its seat at Constantinople, for advice, consequent upon the Spanish Monarchy' s threat that if the Jews in Spain did not convert to Christianity, they would be expelled.

Glimpses of the scope of the interlocking ne xus can be gleaned from the records left by certain boastful initiates. For instance, W illiam Wynn Westcott, an English Mason, was appointed Junior Grand Deacon to the Grand Lodge of England in 1902 and the head of 'Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia'. He was also the head of the subversive 'New Age' Illuminati operation calling itself 'Golden Dawn', as well as being the Secretary of the Rite of Swedenborg, Knight Kadosch of the Ancient and Accepted Sc ottish Rite, Grand Standard Bearer, Royal Arch, Grand Lodge of England, a nd Regent of the Illuminati. In addition, Westcott was on intimate terms with one 'Golden Dawn's founders, the German Jewish 'High' Mason, Theodore Reuss (33o, 90o, 96o). For his part, Reuss included the following among his titles: 'Magnus Supremus in Mundo' (meaning Supreme Magus of the World) of the Esoteric Rosicrucians, Frater Superior and Outer Head in Mundo of the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars (O.T.O.: see page 456), and Sovereign Grand Master for life of the Ancient Rites of Masonry, Memphis and Mizraim Rites for the German Empire and its dependencies. Such 'elevated Masonic personages' would have been 'perfect' candidates for membership of the super-secret (because super-d epraved) Palladian Rite. This organisation was devised both to provide the most senior selected Masons world-wide with a secret forum in which to practice 'high sorcery' and sexual rites, and also as the Illuminati's infrastructure of global cont rol. Its blueprint was devised by the Jewish sorcerer-criminalist Giuseppe Mazzini, who put forward his co ntrol plan in a letter to Albert Pike dated 22nd January 1870, in which he wrote: 'We must leave all the confederations to continue just as they are, with their systems, their central authorities and their diverse modes of correspondence between high grades of the same rite, organized as they are at present, but we must create a super rite, which will remain unknown, to which we will call those Masons of High Degree whom we shall select. With regard to our brothers in Masonry, thes e men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy. Through this supreme rite' - to be used to impose secrecy by means of occult blood-oaths and their accompanying penalty, probably, of death, for any br each - 'we will govern all Freemasonry, which will become the one international center, the more powerful because its direction will be unknown'. In other words, the confusion which the pr esent-day analyst faces, in seeking con- firmation of the infrastmcture and control mechanisms of the Illuminati, was left delib- erately exacerbated - to ensure a perpetual cascade of sand in our faces. The separate identities of the innumerable and always prolifera ting secret societies, and of the innumerable Masonic rites and their counterparts, were instit utionalised, so that future analysts would (they assumed) be unable to work out where the real power lay, and the true source of this devilish cacophony. The Pallad ian Rite was established as the hidden global control mechanism - in the eyes of Mazzini and Pike, and their heirs, at any rate. The Author's earlier nominal attempt to separate Weishaupt from the more obviously Jewish strands of Illuminism can therefore be dismissed now, because it can be seen, and authorities have acknowledged, that Illuminism represented the combined secret operations of the heads of the powerful Jewish Kahal [see pages 453-454] which has always striven for political, financial and economic dominance. The 'open' sect of the Illuminati had indeed been '(re)founded' by the lapsed Jesuit and Je w, Professor Adam Weishaupt, in , the year of the American Revolution and three years after the Jewish Kahal ('centre') in Poland had to go underground when Poland was partitioned.

And in a listing of Jewish influences behind the French Revolution, Lady Queenborough lists Adam Weishaupt himself: 'Upon a close study of Illuminism, we find that the destructive forces which culminated in the French Revolution' were financial, intellectual and anti- Christian, and were all Jewish: # Financial forces: 'In the first class, we co me upon the names of Jewish financiers such as Daniel Itzig, Friedlander, Ceerfbeer , Benjamin and Abraham Goldsmid, Moses Mocatta [and] Veitel Heine Ephraim'. # Intellectual forces: 'In the second categor y, we find Moses Mendelssohn, Naphtali Wessely, Moses Hersheim.... Frederick Nicolai, Adam Weishaupt, Mirabeau, l'Abbe Gregoire, the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbu ttel and Anacha rsis Clootz'. # Anti-Christian forces: 'Lastly, the third class is composed mostly of the group known as the Encyclopedists: d'Alembert, Di derot, Rousseau, Voltaire and of all the Kabbalists practicing magic and among whom we find: Martinez Depasqualy, Leucht, the Magus Count of Saint Germain, Falke and Joseph Balsamo surnamed Cagliostro'. The inclusion in this list of Jewish kabbalis ts of the Count of Saint Germain is of extreme interest, as certain analysts maintain that the Rosicrucian documents identified as having been composed by Sir Francis Bacon, were elaborated or championed by the Count of Saint Germain (1710-17 64), whose other aliases included th e Jewish names of Daniel Wolf and Prince Rakosky (Racoczy). A carefully wove n and concocted veil of 'mystery' has been erected around this character, who is advertised by deluded Masonic illuminati (who profess to 'believe' in reincarn ation) to be a so-called 'ascended master', whose 'service to humanity' goes back more than 150,000 years. Ac cording to various 'magickal' sources, he was born out of wedlock to Queen Elizabeth I, and was named Sir Francis Bacon, and wrote the occult plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Bacon became the leading 16th century proponent of Rosicrucianism. His suppose d 'magick' existence finds him travelling incognito throughout Europe, winding up as Prince Ra coczy of Transylvania (i.e., the Prince of the Jews in that part of the world). Then he transmogrified himself, reappearing as the Comte de Saint Germain in 17th century France. He maintained the same physical appearance throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. His prolonged 'existence' is, of course, a fable fabricated to provide a rationale for the occultic practice of alchemy and of the vain 'q uesf for immortality, in which Rosicrucians notoriously self-indulge. Marie Antoinette's Lady -in-Waiting wrote letters about this, several of which are to be found in The Louvre. The Emperor Frederick the Great, one of the most important of all evil historical Illuminists, referred to the Count as 'the man who never dies'; even at table, when dining with kings, he was never seen to eat. He al so supposedly possessed the ability to transmit himself from, say, Paris to India overnight. Records of St Germain's activities are to be found, allegedly, in French, German, Austri an, Dutch and Danish archives. St Germain was 'last seen' in physical form in around 1822, and these days he works in 'lighter realms', continuing to 'help the world'. (Sources for all such idiocy: a biography by Isabel Cooper-Oakley (Theosophical P ublishing House, 1912; and 'Unveiled Mysteries and the Magic Presence', by Godfre Ray King (St Germai n Press)). So powerful, seemingly, is the residual urge to believe in lies, fabrica tions and magick, that books published on such esoteric inventions actually attract a signific ant readership.

The destruction of Chri stianity and of all Monarchical Governments. Explanations: Christianity has to be destroyed (a) because they confuse and misrepresent Christianity with the Roman Catholic Church's past (and certain continuing) abominations; (b) because the perfect truth of the Word of God through Jesus Christ was rejected by many (but by no means all) of their forebears and they cannot admit they were in error, and also because of ethnic peer-pressure; and (c) more to the point, because True Christianity is completely incompatible with sorcery, magick, astrology, necromancy, the invocation of evil spirits and all the other abominations of Babylon to which their hatred of Christianity has driven them. The destruction of Monarchical Governments is a central objective because they cannot abid e absolutism (although a Monarchical form of control is easy to penetrate, as the 'success' of Rasputin and the American Jewish female guru sent to destabilise Princess Diana seem to have made clear). 2. The destruction of nation states as such in favour of universal inter- nationalism. Explanation: Impe diments in the way of total control are theoretically removed. But in reality, no universal governance system can possibly work, given that all human beings are different - something that irks the Illuminati, who seek by psycho- manipulative, psycho-chemical and social en gineering means to create 'universal man' equipped with a 'common mind'. This endeavour is doomed to failure. 3. The discouragement of patriotic and loyal effort which is branded as narrow-minded prejudice, incompatible with 'goodwill to all men' and the slogan of 'Universal Brotherhood'. Comment: This is indeed the fate of those whom in the UK context for instance, see through the European Union fraud [Chapter 8] and seek to extract the United Kingdom fro m the clutches of this German long-range Illuminati entrapment strategy and systematic coup d'etat by instalments. 4. The abolition of family ties and of marriage by means of systematic corruption. Comment: In the United Kingdom, this process has advanced to the stage at which the young generation lacks all shame and is content to take 'partners' and to shun marriage, with the media constantly braying that marriage has collapsed, and the Masonic Judiciary assisting the process. This is a key objective of the Illuminati, en route to the destruction of private property, whic h marriage is deemed to sustain. 5. The suppression of all rights of inhe ritance and of private property. Comment: As indicated in item 4 above, the destruction of the institution of marriage is intended to prepare the way for the abolit ion of all private property (Communism). Communism by definition implies and intends th e abnegation of private property. Many Jews are naturally Communists because, on balance, they prefer money to property. The progress made by the Rosicrucian Illu minati with their World Revolution was decisively influenced by the history of the European Jewish and Khazarian [see page 473 et seq.] diaspora, which effectively established a 'state within the state' successively in Babylon, Judea (under the Romans), Galilee, Babylonia, Spain and finally Poland in the 1500s, where a Khazarian populati on of millions came into being and the 'centre' of 'Jewish' diaspora governance (the Kahal) was settled. When Poland was partitioned in 1772, this 'centre' disappeared inside Russia . In the 19th century it re-emerged as the Jewish International, with two dialectical wings - Communism and Zionism (Fascism)."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"454 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan In other words, with no firm territorial 'centre', the Talmudic Kahal resolved finally upon internationalism, facilitated by the parallel Judaicisation of Freemasonry consolidated through the merger of the Illuminati with the Lodges. This is The Synagogue of Satan, driven by 'them which say they are Jews, and are not' 50 , which equated the intended destruction of Christianity with global hegemony achieved by financial manipulation. Since nation states and private property (except for the 'Chosen') stand in the way of this agenda, they, along with the very foundations of society such as marriage and the family, are 'legitimate targets' and the 'collateral damage' of this World Revolution. Accordingly: • The secret societies and Masonic Lodges are recruiting devices calculated to separate continuing Gentile Christians, of whatever denomination, from the revealed truth that is in Jesus Christ, and to replace True Christianity with the Luciferian, esoteric 'New Ageism', magick, spiritism and sorcery in which the Synagogue of Satan specialises. • These abominations are derived from the Babylonian Kabbalah, and from the Egyptian and Eleusinian mysterie s which are foreign to the true Jewish revealed tradition, and echo the final decision of the children of Israel and their Khazarian mimics to abandon the Lord of Hosts in favour of the pagan demon-gods against which they were warned throughout their ancient history - in favour of this Synagogue of Satan. • Again, as has been seen (Chapter 5), Je wish authorities specifically assert that 'Masonry is Jewish'. It is the primary mechan ism for the cynical and duplicitous transmission of Khazarian kabbalistic abominations which have no part in the revealed truth of God as taught in the Torah. The Synagogue of Satan is indeed the habitation of devils. • The untutored Goy dupes in the Lodge imagine that they are learning the real truth as revealed to the Jews: indeed, they even use a doctored Bible for the purpose. But they have 'no part nor lot' with the truth of the Lord of Hosts. Since they take blood and other occult oaths, pledging their loyalty to Satan in some rituals, they are partakers of the Synagogue of Satan and either blindly or knowingly abandon any hope of salvation. As Disraeli candidly asserted through the words of one of his characters in 'Coningsby', these dupes do not worship the Lord of Hosts, but rather Lucifer himself. The deepest sense of Christ's condemnation of such people has to do with their knowing confusion of Christ with Lucifer (devilish inversion of the truth). This practice was alluded to by the French 19th century occultist Bataille, in the following passage (remember, crucially, that these practitioners of occult rituals and initiation ceremonies understand spiritual matters better than many so-called Christians): 'According to the teaching of the Christian churches, God allows demons certain limited powers, but they are not permitted to open the Gates of Hell and release a spirit at the request of one who evokes the dead. The dead, even damned, will not show themselves if evoked, nor would evocations be answered by those who had succeeded in attaining the Kingdom of Heaven; but devils can and do, says the Church, substitute themselves for the deceased. They will impersonate a dead person whose appearance is demanded by invocations'. The 'mystery of iniquity' thrives on and exploits confusion, since human beings have free will and, even when blind and living in the spiritual darkness, retain a sufficient knowledge of good and evil never to be powerless to choose between them. This may seem to contradict the theme of this book, which illustrates how the evil people it describes seem to be predisposed always to take the aberrant course. They 'sit in darkness and in the shadow of [spiritual and physical] death', fearful of break ing away - even though the single step of true repentance and faith they must take, can be easy and simple."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 455 PAPAL NECROMANCY AND THE GNOSTICISM OF SIMON MAGUS This appears to be what was happening in the Vatican Palace in 2005. Pope Benedict XVI made it quite plain in a Polish television interview on 16th October, according to 'Der Spiegel', that he is in regular touch with a being that he delusionally believes to be Pope John Paul II [see page 294]. However the dead do not communicate with the living, although evil spirits do. Therefore, what Pope Benedict XVI is 'receiving' from his predecessor will necessarily represent distorti ons of whatever his predecessor may have said and written, whether Pope John Paul II's writte n statements were spiritually correct in the first place, or not. The new Pope told his superstitious Polish viewers that 'my personal mission is not to issue many new documents, but to ensure that his documents are assimilated, because they are a rich treasure. I hear him and I see him speaking, so I can keep up a continuous dialogue with him. His nearness to me isn't limited to words and texts, because behind the texts I hear the Pope himself. A man who goes to the Lord doesn't disappear: I believe that someone who goes to the Lord comes even closer to us'. However Jesus Christ was dismissive of such superstitious, pagan ideas, saying sternly: 'Let the dead bury their dead' 51 . He was stern about this in order to leave no room for doubt that the mystery of the Resurrection is not to be confused with pagan fantasies about life after death. Necromancy is defined as 'the revealing of future events through pretended communication with the dead; sorcery' 52 . That passage by Bataille concluded: 'It is also admitted [by the Christian churches] that fallen angels or spirits will often manifest to people without being called. The theological hagiographa cite many cases of diabolical apparitions to saints, apparitions which these saints have been able to repel and conquer ... but what skeptics and agnostic Christians [sic!] alike ignore is that beside the drawing room mediums, mediums for diversion, there are occultists whose vile practices are veiled in the profoundest mystery. These men, whose moral sense is absolutely perverted, believe in Lucifer, but they believe him to be the equal of God and worship him secretly', as Ezekiel once saw 53 . They do this secretly in the darkness of the Synagogue of Satan - as was revealed to Ezekiel over five centuries before Christ - where they practice, in addition to satanic rites and invocations of evil spirits at certain levels of initiation, the Gnosticism originally espoused by Simon Magus and Albert Pike , based on spiritism, using mediums. According to one authority, 'such was the Excellency of their Knowledge and Illumination, who arrogantly styled themselves Gnostics, that they are superior to Peter or Paul or any of Christ's other disciples. Th ey only, have drunk up the Supreme Knowledge, are above Principalities and Powers, secure of Sa lvation: and for that very reason, are free to debauch women, or indulge in all manner of licentiousness. This knowledge is of itself perfect redemption, and sufficient.... Si mon Magus... instituted certain foul and infamous Mysteries inexpressibly filthy and had assemblies equally filthy to celebrate them.... [Certain of their number]... taught incontinence to be obligatory, as a law; and not onl y lawful, but necessary to salvation; not only compatible with the Saviour's religion, but an essential part of it: and those were the best men, who in common opinion were the most vicious. [These people] grew to that degree of madness, that being unable to conceal their debaucheries, they made incontinence to be a law [teaching that] fornication ought to be open and public, and the use of women common. For which reason, in their feasts, the candles were extinguished, each lay with the women, as chance appointed; and they called this lasciviousness a mystical initiation, a mystical communion' 54 . This louche filthiness is repl icated on Britain's Channel 5 TV station nightly."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"456 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan THE PROLIFERATION OF DEBAUCHED AND REPROBATE MODERN RITES Further manifestations of this same Jewish madness surfaced in other parts of the world. For instance, Emmanuel Swedenborg, the son of Jasper Swedberg who in turn was the son of Daniel Isaakson of Fahlun, Sweden, was initiated at Lund in 1706 and progressed to the higher Templar Degrees as practiced in Sweden. Swedenborg's Rite, founded in 1721, was introduced into England by the Swedish Consul, Springer, and other Swedes, who set up the first Swede nborgian Society in London, known as the Theosophical Society of the New Jerusalem. The Rite was taken to the Americas by a Swedenborgian Minister, Brother Samuel Be swick, who lived at Strathroy, Canada, where he wrote a book on the Swedenborgian Rite, called 'The llluminati of Stockholm'. What is known as the Rite of Swedenborg was another modification of The Order of the llluminati of Avignon, effected by the Marquis de Thome in 1783 55 . The llluminati of Avignon were founded there in 1760 by Antoine Joseph Pernety, a defrocked Benedictine monk, a kabbalist and an alchemist. A modified version of the Avignon Rite was intro- duced in Paris at the Lodge Socrates of Perfect Union under the name of Illumines Theosophiques. The Rite became extin ct, but the Degree of Kni ght of the Sun, founded by Pernety, which was divided into two Degrees, became the 27th and 28th Degrees of the (misleadingly termed) Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite 56 . A further secret manifestatio n of Illuminism, or one of them, was developed by the German Jew Karl Kellner in 1895. After he died in 1905, he was succeeded by the previously mentioned 'high' German Mason, also Jewish, Theodore Reuss, who was the official agent of one of the most active Free masonic Illuminists ever to have lived, John Yarker. This English Mason, a 33rd Degree Scottish Rite initiate, received over 12 patents of 33° of the Supreme Council in various parts of the world, held high initiated offices in Greece, Ireland, Italy (for which he acted as an organising Masonic ambassador), Spain, and other countries, holding the honour of Hon. Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Germany and Cuba, and was a high priest of the 7th Degr ee of Knights Templar priests in Manchester. His agent, Theodore Reuss, was the Delegate of the A. and P. Rite of Memphis from Spain and Bulgaria to Germany, and from Germany to England. ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS One of Reuss's Masonic patents was signed by fellow Jews Franz Hartmann 33°, 90°, 95°, and Henry Klein, 33°, 95°, the powerful Jewish so licitor based in London. These transnational interconnections are of interest, as they illu minate a curious feature of international intelligence operations noticed by the Author - namely, that foreign intelligence operatives have been known to be appointed Ambassadors to third countries by a client state, to facilitate travel arrangements, the penetration of official structures and the completion of clandestine transactions. This methodology is modelled upon the practice of diplomatic appointments and activ ity perfected by the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta. In 1902, Theodore Reuss, the German Jewish lllumina ti operative and agent of John Yarker, named William Wynn Westcott as Regent of the llluminati, thereby establishing or reinforcing the de facto interlocking directorate between th e Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, and German Illuminism. This organi sation remained underground, like so many other manifestations or 'splinters' of 'The Order', until the early 20th century. The resu lting reprobate manifestation of 'T he Order', Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), called itself, maximising Luciferian confusion, 'a body of in itiates in whose hands are concentrated the wisdom and knowledge of the following bodies and Rites:"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 457 Figure 69: At around the turn of the c entury, Karl Kellner, a German of Jewish extraction, (re)founded the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a ritual magick group which ta ught sex magick, and which is believed to be the 'open' manifestation of Albert Pike's Palladian Rite 'tradition' . [Aleister] Crowley joined the O.T.O. and was made the head of its British affiliate. To the heterosexual Ninth Degree he added a homosexual Eleventh Degree. O.T.O. sexual magick is derived from oriental sources as well as from P. B. Randolph of the American-based Fraternitas Rosae Cruris. It was 'perfected' by Crowley during three years (1920-23) at the Abbey of Thelema in Sicily. Crowley succeeded Theodore Reuss in 1922 as Outer Head of the O.T.O.. Upon Crowley's death in 1947, Karl Johannes Germer succeeded to the Outer Headship of The Order'. Germer had been with Crowley in England, but returned to his native Germany in the 1930s'. The family names Kellner, Crowley, Reuss and Germer are all known to be Jewish family names, but the a main focus of interest is the obv ious reality that this satanic Order sprang from the subversive operations of the llluminati in Germany -from whence, as this wo rk demonstrates, the llluminati's assault on civilisation is being directed. In 1904, Crowley 'received' The Book of t he Lav/ which it is claimed was based on instructions largely 'channelled' to him by 'spirit guides' , i.e. evil spirits, during a visit to Egypt (which is metaphorically The Darkness' in Old Testament biblical terms). This so-called 'received' document purportedly 'replaces' Christianity and its 'lav/ of personal sacrifice and overcoming temptation, with the Thelema' of Ordo Templi Orientis - the governing instruction of which is 'Do as Thou Wilt' (modem vernac ular: 'Do your own thing'). In the occultic language used in the O.T.O. context, the phrase 'Concealed Child' represents the 'new Aeon' before its 'birth' in 1904; and the ensuing 'age' is called the 'Age of t he Child', a.k.a. the 'New Age' and the 'Age of Aquarius'. During the 'Millennium Bug' period, computer users around the world learned, in most cases for the first time, that the 'Date and Time' functions built in to the software ALWAYS default to 1st January 1904. Now why was that? Why does computer software not default to 1900, or 1901, or 1960? Why 1904? The answer to this question is that computers and software are essential in struments for the dissemination of t he evil 'values' for which Ordo Templi Orientis stands: so they default to t he birth of the 'New Age'. Hence the deliberate flooding of our computers via the Internet with pornography, dubious pharmaceutical 'cures ', scamming operations and other grotesque inventions of Satan. The accuracy of this assessment was separately rev ealed to a colleague of this Author by a relative who is a high-ranking llluminati operative. The source confirmed it is not for nothing that Bill Gates is known as 'The Gatekeeper', and that it is intended that every computer in the world will 'talk to' the Pentagon, the seat of the enforcement arm of the 'New World Order' - that is, The Order to be imposed by the Rosicrucian (llluminati)-driven 'New World' which is secretly controlled by European Forces of Darkness.

In addition, Ordo Templi Orientis is said to be 'in close alliance' with an Order called Atlantean Adepts (AA), a term which, as is typically the case, is not defined. There is some evidence that O.T.O. existed well before the beginning the 20th century. It is advanced inter alia by Craig Heimbichner, who notes on pages 71-72 of his 2005 book 'Blood on The Altar: The Secret History of the World's Most Dangerous Secret Society' 57 : 'Occult sources indicate that Albert Pike was chartered to run a branch of the Societas Rosicruciana in the United States, a Rosicrucian Order which intersected with both the O.T.O. and the Hermetic Brot herhood of Luxor (light) - both of which initiated adepts in ritual sex magick'. The O.T.O., then, appears to be an overt manifestation of Pike's Palladism. Several 'gaps' in the existence of the O.T.O. are believed to have materialised at various stages in later years, before a further reorganisation which launched 'The Order', driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer', onto its contemporary 'unstoppable' World Revolution path. Details of a hiatus, in the 1970s, are of little interest, and may reflect a subsequently reversed decision to go temporarily underground. In any case, we must not lose sight of the fact that what is known of this abomination may simply represent its 'outer' face. Certain detailed information about O.T.O. has been forthcoming from the former 9th Degree O.T.O. initiate and sorcerer, who later became a Christian, William Schnoebelen, whose importance in expanding our understanding of these matters was alluded to in Chapter 5. According to an edition of 'The Equinox' published in 1919, the Illuminati were reor- ganised yet again, at the beginning of the 20th century. The reorganisation has had spec- tacular consequences. Specifically, 'the dispersion of the original secret wisdom having led to confusion, it was determined by the Chiefs of all these Orders to recombine and centralise their activities, even as white ligh t, divided in a prism, may be recomposed' 58 . In this context, the phrase 'secret wisdom', whenever used by Masonic Lodges and secret societies of the Illuminati, invariably means esoteric 'occult knowledge', namely sorcery"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 459 'The Equinox' elaborated: 'It was [the German Jew] Karl Kellner who revived the esoteric organisation of the O.T.O. and initiated the plan now happily complete of bringing all occult bodies again under one governance'. In a 'Gnostic Mass' printed in the same issue, it is stated that 'saints' include the adepts Karl Kellner and Theodore Reuss. From notes by Reuss and from correspondence between him and Kellner, the fundamental principles and remit of the O.T.O. have become known, and bear out the following: • This complex (now powerful) occult orga nisation was established for the specific purpose of substituting the phallic religion for Christianity. It is nothing less than the means by which the following prophecy of the prophet Jeremiah would be fulfilled: 'As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth' 59 . What this means is that Babylonian kabbalistic sorcery, having trapped those children of Israel who have fallen for its fatal enticements which lead to spiritual death, will likewise entice dupes from all over the world, causing their spiritual death as well. This is a precise prophecy and it should be taken extremel y seriously by anyone with 'ears to hear and eyes to see'. Indeed, with the destruction of residual morality in Britain and the United States, especially, 'anything goes' has become a re dundant statement. In February 2006, the Author accidentally turned on Channel Five (known as 'Channel Filth') late at night. The US-sourced programme was so depraved that he needed to pray specially for the filth he had witnessed to be expunged. Imagine the impact on all who have no belief. And this is going on all the year round, with no respite to the avalanche of ribaldry. THE NEW HEGEMONY OF THE JEWI SH KABBALISTIC PHALLIC 'RELIGION' Since the establishment of the O.T.O. manifestation of the Illuminati, to which George Bush Sr., for instance, allegedly belongs, the phallic 'religion' has overwhelmed almost all public and electronic entertainment, and is the sole focus of the corrupt, drug-ridden and depraved pop and rock industry, which disseminates satanic 'music' globally in pursuit of this Illuminati objective. There is no doubt that Ordo Templi Orientis was indeed established by the two named German Jews. The German publication of this sect was entitled Oriflamme. Given that Theodore Reuss was the agent of the most powerful geomason of his era, John Yarker, both Kellner and Reuss were, among many other associated Masonic parties, in close, continuing geomasonic relati onship with John Yarker, William Wynn Westcott -the Supreme Magus of British occult Rosicrucianism - the Grand Lodge of England and innumerable other manifestations and derivations of The Order. A document confirming that all concerned (a nd all those Orders listed) concurred in the formation of the Order of Oriental Temp lars (German: Orientalischer Templer-Orden) and its esoteric doctrine, is to be found in th e Bibliotheque Nationale de Paris. Dated 1917, it contains the constitution and certain informati on relating to the O.T.O., stating that 'The Ancient Order of Oriental Templars, an organisation formerly known as the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, has been reorganised and re-constituted' 60 . The Hermetic Brotherhood had operated in the past as a conduit for spreading occultic notions and practices among the masses. Heimbichner has a detailed summary of the evolution of O.T.O. under Reuss, who developed instructions for the sect from the Kabbalah of the Rabbis, despite allusions to 'Gnostic Christianity', a phrase which is in an y case a contradiction in terms. 'Kellner fell terminally ill in 1904, and Reuss, excited by the kabbalistic secrets, began recruiting"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"460 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan members of the Scottish Rite and Memphis-Mizraim Freemasonry (also sexual in its advanced Degrees) for a new, emerging Order'. This would appear, as indicated, simply to have been an elaboration or copy of, or substitution for, Palladism reconstituted by Pike as the new and Reformed Palladian Rite, or New and Reformed Palladium, at Giuseppe Mazzini's suggestion, and rescue d from a 'moribund' state at Charleston, having originally been founded back in 1730 as 'The Order of the Palladium'. In a work called 'Cyclopedia of the Fraternities', the author (Steve ns) reported that the 'old' Palladium was little known as the number of its members was strictly limited and the deepest secrecy surrounded all its deliberations. 'Kellner', Heimbichner continues, 'died the following year (1905). By 1906, The Order had crystallised into the Ordo Templi Orientis', which seems indeed to have mimicked Pallad ism with a view to replacing it: we cannot really reach a tighter conclusion on the matter, using open information, than that. 'Soon Reuss's Masonic publication 'Oriflamme' announ ced the O.T.O. Eventually, Reuss claimed that all of the secret knowledge of High Degree Freemasonry had been distilled by the O.T.O. into a system of Eleven Degrees'. 'The first three Degrees were essentially similar to any Blue Lodge. The Fourth through the Sixth Degrees captured the most important and powerful points of initiation in nearly all High Degree systems: the Royal Arch, Rose-Croix, and Kadosh rituals. The Seventh Degree furnished theory for the Eighth and Ninth Degrees, which consist of sex- magick (the Eighth involves \"magickal masturbation\" and the Ninth, coitus -the \"Sanctuary of the Gnosis\")'. 'The O.T.O.'s Tenth Degree confers administration over a country (\"Supreme and Holy King\"), while the Eleventh - the / highesf O.T.O. Rite, code-named 'the Eye within the Triangle', or 'Eye of Sef- incorporates a homosexual anal intercourse version of the Ninth' 61 . All this filth is distilled from the Jewish Kabba lah, a truth that is acknowledged by the Jewish Encyclopedia itself, which asserts that 'Jewish Gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity... Magick, also... was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of Gnosticism, (which) largely occupied Jewish thinkers. It is a noteworthy fact that heads of Gnostic schools and founders of Gnostic systems are designated as Jews by the Church Fathers. Some derive all heresies, including those of Gnosticism, from Judaism' 62 . From his knowledge of the Zohar system of occult integration, Craig Heimbichner identifies Reuss's instructions for the O.T.O. as having been derived from it - as Reuss uses the same language as the Zohar. 'If the youth is mature, then he will complete the first coitus under the direction and instruction of the 'Matrona' (or High Priestess) in a ritual manner and in the form of a \"Sacramental Act\". Just the same will the virgin be introduced' 63 . And Reuss's foul successor, Aleister Crowley demanded nothing less than the elimination of childhood: 'The Beast 666 [as he called himself] adviseth that all children shall be accustomed from infancy to w itness every type of sexual act...'. Such abominable degradation of innocent children, such gross blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, is simply a perpetuation of the abominations committed by the ancient Israelites against which their prophets warned, as well as representing an explicit rejection of the 'peace of God which passeth all understanding' 64 of Jesus Christ, and 'the love of Christ which passeth knowledge' 65 . Furthermore, the 'seething' purpose of the Jewish Kohal [pages 453-454], through these devious, complex and deliberately confusing secret arrangements, to foist the abominations upon the rest of humanity, not only impoverishes and degrades the rest of the world, but leaves Jews and impostor Khazars"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 461 themselves spiritually empty, bewildered, lost and desolate: 'Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord' 66 . The Reuss papers confirm that the O.T.O., which as indicated may have existed under Albert Pike, if it was not an alternative name for the Palladian Rite back then, surfaced in 1902, and that prior to 1917, the official year of its formation, it was an underground organisation, acting as a link between the Scottish Rite and various unofficial international groups. In addition to Kellner, Reuss, Yark er and Westcott, other prominent operatives associated with the es tablishment of the O.T.O. or its manifestation as a new Illuminati instrument were Gregor Mathers, Franz Hartmann and Aleister Crowley, all of Jewish extraction. Crowley's secretary was the Judaic Israel Regudy (a.k.a. 'Regardie'), Figure 70: The reprobate British intelli gence officer and 'high' llluminati Satanist Aleister Crowley, in full Masonic regalia. According to the extremely perceptive analyst Crai g Heimbichner, 'while the Order of Skull and Bones is currently driving the busload of squabbling, dumbed-down 'Goyim', another secret society' (Ordo Templi Orientis, directed for years by the ogre pictured above) 'is processing them, as it processed the 60s generation, and the elite intellectuals since the early years of the 20th cent ury - in the alchemist's beaker known as education'."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"462 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan a founder of The Order of th e Golden Dawn (progenitor of 'New Age' apostasy), the author of such esoteric books as 'The Eye in the Triangle' [Phoenix, Falcon, 1982], 'Gems from the Equinox: Instructions by Aleister Crowley for His Own Magickal Order' (implying that O.T.O. was Crowley's 'personal' organisation) [Phoenix, Falcon, 1986], 'The Golden Dawn: An Account of the Teachings, Rites and Ceremonies of the Order of the Golden Dawn' [St Paul, MN, Llewellyn, 1984], and 'The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic' [York Beach, Samuel Wieser, 1972]. L Ron Hubbard, a US Office of Naval Intelligence operative, Satanist and follower of Crowley, institutionalised many of Crowley's abominations through his Church of Scientol ogy, reviewed earlier, which has been called 'Cro wleyanity'. The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) is among the most lethal and 'Illuminated' of the sub-agencies of the Central Intelligence Agency. One of Crowley's specialities was recruiting into O.T.O. members of 'the Great and the Good'. His most prominent recruit in Britain was Major-General John Frederick Charles Fuller (1878-1966), as his deput y in the AA ('Atlantean Adepts', a.k.a. The Order of the Silver Star). Fuller invented the Blitzkrieg tactic, which Hitler adopted - and the British later implemented over the fabulous Baroque city of Dresden, in one of the most heinous war crimes of the Second World War. THE MOST DANGEROUS GANG OF RUTHLESS REPROBATES IN THE WORLD In addition to its secret phallic doctrine, the O.T.O. agitates in innumerable hidden ways for the revival of Gnosticism, the study of the Jewish Kabbalah (hence the pop star Madonna's infatuation with Kabbalism, which is clearly an orchestrated operation to raise its profile among the ignorant youth of the Goyim), other esoteric fantasies and Indian Yogism. Tt seeks to extract from their combined doctrines the practical application of Eastern sorcery and Western witchcraft, wherein medicine and hypnotism occupy a place of prime importance, serving solely materialistic ends' 67 . A list of alleged Illuminati mass mind-control programmers and sorcerers engaged in maximising the leverage obtainable from drug-dealing, satanic rock and other s ubversive inventions and investments of the Illuminati, is given in the Second Appendix to this Chapter [page 517]. The German Jewish/Khazar origins and continuing derivation and control of O.T.O. are affirmed by all relevant sources. According to the 'Encyclopedia of American Religions', 'around the turn of the [last] century, Karl Kellner, a German [Jew], founded [sic] the Ordo Templi Orientis, a ritual magick group which taught sex magick. [The British intelligence officer Aleister] Crowley joined the O.T.O. and was made the head of its British affiliate. To the heterosexual Ninth Degree he added a homosexual Eleventh Degree. O.T.O. sexual magick seems to have been derived from oriental sources as well as from P. B. Randolph, of the American Fraternitas Ro sae Crucis. It was perfected by Crowley during three years (1920- 23) at the Abbey of Thelema in Sicily [following which Crowley was ordered to leave the country, as his satanic activities met with general disapproval there - Ed.]. Crowley succeeded Theodore Reuss in 1922 as 'outer h ead' of the O.T.O. Upon Crowley's death in 1947, [the German Jew] Karl Johannes Germer succeeded to the 'outer headship of The Order.

Their lethality arises from their ingrained Rosicrucian-derived habit of intermeddling with the Works of Darkness and of communing with capricious forces that they foolishly believe they can control but which, being pr ogeny of the Great Deceiver, deceive them instead. Such operatives have no problem at all, for instance, with the CIA's 'Heart of Darkness' and with the widespread use by the US military and their evil subcontractors of torture methodology which the State Department's respected 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices' has double-mindedly condemned in all countries with the single exception of the United States itself, for decades. On 10th October 2005, The Daily Telegraph 70 reported that the Bush Administration was threatening that the President would veto legislation prohibiting the torture of prisoners by US troops, following an overwhelming revolt by Republican legislators. In one late-night Senate vote, a measure forbidding the use of torture was passed by 90 votes to nine. Led by Senator John McCain, who was himself tortured while a prisoner in Vietnam, the amendment would 'prohibit the cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of prisoners in the custody of the US Defense Department'. In response, the former White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, pronounced: 'We have put out a Statement of Administration Policy saying that [the President's] advisers would recommend that he vetoes it if it contains such language'. Earlier, Vice President Richard Chen ey had gone to the Senate to insist that torture must not be prohibited. The lust to 'inflict pain without flinching' which, as Malachi Martin taught, is among the three darkest consequences of 'high' o ccult-Masonic initiation, was thus yet again exposed, along with its consequences at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, as integrated into the Luciferian mentality of the US Federal Government - which should come as no surprise, given that the US Government is a Rosicrucian foundation steeped in the Black culture of the occult. Heimbichner asserts that 'seething energy' for the prosecution of 'Black policy' is imparted to government not least through the Illuminati hiding within the O.T.O. It was, he argues, 'the British Intelligence Office Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) [see Figure 70 on page 461], the self-styled 'Great Beast 666'... dubbed 'The Wickedest Man in the World' by the [defunct] English paper John Bull, who gave this secret society its most potent modern shape and direction, effectively recreating it in his own bestial image. It has since adapted and grown, taking an increasingly decentralised and laid-back outer form...'. 71 . The O.T.O. today has Lodges and what Heimbichner calls 'power zones' across the world, including Israel, Russia and South America, and still claims to be the 'graduate school' for the old prototypical fraternal order and 'service club' known as the Freemasons' 72 . Clearly, this statement corresponds with the documented facts concerning the amalgamation of Illuminati Orders and secret societies, already described. Throughout this investigation we must of course remain at all times on guard against familiar Illuminati lies, half-truths and diversionary ploys. Heimbichner is well aware of this necessity, as he continues: 'Freemasons would dispute this claim, but we will see that such protests reflect either ignorance or an attempt at deception of the \"Cowans\" (outsiders), including deception of lower-level dupes within their own system of Lodges' 73 . But it is neither here nor there what Freemasons ca re to think, since we have seen, from the pen of none other than Albert Pike, that 'it is not intended that [they] should understand...; but it is intended that [they] shall imagine that [they] understand'. Why on earth join a secret society that boasts of deceiving its own membership?"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"464 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan O.T.O.'S COVER AS A 'F RINGE' OR 'IRREGULAR' ILLUMINATI 'ORDER' Heimbichner goes on to explain, contrary to the impression so far extracted here from the literature, that The O.T.O. is a traditional \"fringe Masonic\" or \"irregular\" Order, a special group structure which exists in a frat ernal relationship with top members of Grand Lodge \"regular\" Freemasonry, minus official sanction, enabling convenient public disavowals and denial of the Grand Lodge when incriminating activities of these 'irregular' Lodges occasionally reach public awareness' 74 . This assessment raises the perennial (and since we are dealing with the culture of dark occult secrecy, effectively unanswered) question of whether O.T.O. is a sel f-appointed 'parallel' outlet and instrument for the dissemination of pagan norms and sor cery throughout contro lling elites and through their influence, into society as a whole, or whet her it really represents the consolidated secret society and Masonic Palladian forces of the Illuminati, as the serious open literature suggests. Certain 'authorities' insist that O.T.O. is a se parate conduit for the promulgation of sorcery and the 'Ancient Mysteries', but the following st atement, couched in typically confused and opaque defensive language, by a past Master of both a Masonic Lodge and an O.T.O. 'oasis' (as The Order's 'Lodges' are apparently called) essentially sup ports the assessment that the Author has derived from the respected literature sources. The statement confirms O.T.O.'s formal relationship with Rosi crucian-propelled Freemasonry: 'Freemasons claim that they arose out of the Masonic (i.e., those who build with stone) guilds of the Middle Ages, and intimate that their actual origins stem from the Knights Templar. By the time they fully revealed themselves to the public (at the for- mation of the United Grand Lodge of Engl and in 1717), they claimed that they had evolved from 'operative' Masons (actual build ers/architects), into 'speculative' Masons (pondering the philosophical morality in the sy mbols of the builders' craft), who derived elaborate ceremonies and morality plays in order to explicate and get the point across, with liberal subliminal doses of qabbalistic symbo lism. The way I see it, the evolution of the Masons was from operative to speculative, but I would say that it was in a Rosicrucian sense rather than a Masonic sense. I see in the rituals of Freemasonry an attempt to infuse classical Rosicrucian symbolism into Masonic initiation in su ch a manner as would not be inflammatory to such as would find it objectionabl e. The rituals of O.T.O. go a step toward tearing down the veil concealing that additional symbol ism... reformulated as a sort of 'new aeon' Freemasonry. However O.T.O. makes no claim to make 'Masons', but rather 'magicians', as a comparison of Degree titles between the two systems would suggest. Similarly, the 'A. A.' [ = Atlantean Adepts: see above: - Ed.] is a reformulation of the traditional Rosicrucian model (i.e., Golden Dawn, AMORC etc) with a 'new aeon spin' 75 . Note that the speaker cited by Craig Heimbichner here is himself a sorcerer, and that he is implicitly perfectly content with the sexual and other abominations with which he is necessarily familiar as a participant in both 'streams' of the occult. Given that he is himself necessarily confus ed, as are all those who dabble, whether naively or not, in these Works of Darkness, it is hardly surpri sing that independent outside investigators are in danger of remaining conf used by the lies and half-truths that these people utter. This Author has, however, th e benefit of access to Manly P. Hall's rare Rosicrucian work 76 which definitively confirms the accu racy of the Rosicrucian engine and dimension of this collective abomination. We can therefore safely suggest that O.T.O. represents, at the least, one of a number of central over t loci of the contemporary Illuminati, as well as providing a more intensive and preposterously decadent kabbalistic outlet for the 'seething energies of Lucifer', beyond even the possibilities provided at the 'highest'"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 465 levels of Freemasonry through the parallel Scottish and York Rites, and the Palladian (orgiastic fornication) Rite. The O.T.O. goes to the extremes of Talmudic paganism. Although, as we have seen, blood oaths, treasonable actions, sorcery, the sum- moning of evil spirits and other abominations are encountered at various levels of Freemasonry, at the lower levels and in the 'Blue Degrees', your regular Masonic dupe can retain a degree of moral integrity by turning a blind eye to what he or she encounters, with 'put-down' generalisations such as 'oh, I only do this because of the dinners, the camaraderie and because I meet interesting people I wouldn't otherwise meet, and if I am honest, because I need the contacts'. Heimbichner is rightly scathing about such people and confirms basically that one cannot make progress within the US official or legal structures outside Masonry - a state of affairs which the Author knows to be true, since the husband of a US contact was approached at a cer tain stage of his career by two Masons who came to the family home and stated baldly that he would make no further progress in his political career unless he became a Mason. 'Like Al Capone with his Chicago soup kitchens, the Masons cover themselves with many charitable activities, usually performed by... the \"Porch Brethren\" (Blue Degree 'Useful Idiots').

The \"Bar association\", the US Court and police systems, the Federal Government, the mi litary and the Space Program, are heavily infiltrated with Freemasons.... The average \"Knife and Fork\" Freemason is a pitiable dupe. He gullibly trades his good name to the Lodge as a member, in exchange for a mess of pottage in the form of a greased career track' 77 . A similar environment in the United Kingdom was first exposed in 1984 by Stephen Knight, in his classic work 'The Brother hood: The Secret World of the Freemasons', shortly after which poor Mr Knight died suddenly and mysteriously a la Mozart 78 . FAST-TRACK PASSPORT INTO A WORLD OF KABBALISTIC DEBAUCHERY It is an obvious but little-stated fact that just about the only people who have time available to waste in Masonic and occult pursuits are members of the legal profession, which all too often specialises in lying and 'economies with the tr uth', and those whose livelihood is paid for in the public sector by the taxpayer (or, in th e case of US intelligence operatives, to some extent from 'Black Budget' sources). It is these people, who regulate and interfere with our lives, who have time to spare and who wittingly or unwittingly dabble with sorcery through their Masonic activities - instead, for instance, of reading Scripture and praying more often, as one of the Author's most remarkable friends in Britain decided to do in 2005. Those of us who have to make our living commercially in order to pay the swingeing taxes that these people impose, the proceeds of which are so conspicuously wasted on our behalf, have no time for such foolishness. Not a ll Masons are parasites, but large numbers are certainly public sector employees. Mr Heimbichner's accurate contention is that the O.T.O. exists in order to bypass the slow-motion ritualistic indoctrination over a prolonged period of time that is provided by the devious Masonic progression process, and to 'plunge headlong' instead 'into the very subjects the High Degree Masons are told are reserved to the core of initiation' [sic]. 'And at the core of these secrets is the embrace of contradiction, of the \"elexir of life\", and of the power of blood....

These secrets also formed the basis of our space program as propelled by O.T.O. leader John Whiteside Parsons, founder of the Aerojet Corporation and co-founder of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California'. Since O.T.O. is of German (Jewish) parentage, it would not be surprising if further deep research into this subject were to reveal direct links between O.T.O. and the occultism of Nazi Germany in general - and associated with the activities of the Himmler scientists, whose two primary fields of interest were space trav el and mind-control operations, in particular. Parsons was leader of the California O.T.O. for several years. As previously discussed, those who seek to be 'as gods' have a desperate 'need' to establish that life forms exist externally to the Earth, since for some reason they assume that this would definitively confirm their mechanistic view of the unive rse and the mad 'God sleeps' fantasy (Deism). However the reality, as mankind will ultimately come to realise, is that there are no life-forms anywhere in the universe except on Earth, which is where the Lord performed His Wonderful Works for His and our benefit. Apparently Parsons regarded his work in laying the groundwork for flights to the moon, as 'an act of ritual magic'. As Craig Heimbichner elaborates, this kabbalistic, occult 'gnosis has shaped Hollywood and American politics, the Catholic Church and modern culture itself, sparking the spread of Wicca and the modern homos exual movement, ultimately ushering the modern world into what initiates call the era of \"Horus the Child\", processing our culture, transforming its vestiges of Christianity into deepening layers of Crowleyanity' 79 . Since 2004 was evidently the centenary of this 'New Aeon' referred to by the Mason and O.T.O. operative cited on page 464, the O.T.O. produced a centenary edition of its odious 'holy book' for the occasion. Certainly, in the hund red years or so since the apparent foundation of O.T.O., the foundations of civilised and Christian society have been extensively demolished, in accordance with the revolutionary principle of the Danish philosopher Kirkegaard, that the most successful revolu tions are those which take place within the framework of the ancien regime. The O.T.O. indulges in utter depravity, and has penetrated the highest levels of Western Governments, presupposing the abom inations committed among the elite at the Bohemian Grove in California. Crowley and Israel Regudy were primarily responsible for pioneering obsessive focus, on behalf of the Rosicrucian core, in the Kabbalah -from which, as has been mentioned, the contemporary explosion of interest spearheaded by the Illuminati's (Jewish) instrument Madonna, is derived. Britney Spears, Eminem and other satanic pop operatives such as the vile, filthy, degenerate and evil-looking Rolling Stones (an allegedly gangster group much favoured by European Black Nobility), do not belt out hatred lyrics and (in the case of Eminem) wear a Neo-Nazi look , by accident many of the top pop singers emerge from an internship within the Walt Disney Empire called the 'Mickey Mouse Club' and are offered stardom and worldly riches in exchange for what amounts to allegiance to Satan, mind-control and of course losing their souls. Lyrics typically advocate despair, violence, suicide and fake New Age 'spirituality' - all of which are familiar statements of Satan's preoccupations. Intended effects of pervasive satanic 'noise ' (deceitfully called 'music') include of course the spreading of disarray, disharmony, co nfusion, jealousy, distress, disfunctionality and disorientation among the young separating them from family and home, and leveraging their anger against authority. This is a contrived consequence of the sterile revolutionary 'educational brainwashing' they have recei ved, which denies their individuality."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 467 THE ILLUMINATI'S MASS MIND-CONTROL PROGRAMMERS Madonna appears on a long list of occult Illuminati mind programmers published by web.archive.org - labelled 'Satanist and Monarch slave' - along with Hillary Clinton, who is labelled 'Illuminati witch and mind-contro l slave handler' (as likewise implied in the Cathy O'Brien/Mark Phillips book, 'Trance Formation of America'), in the company of the late Pope John Paul H (a.k.a. Karol Wojtyla), who was identified as an Illuminati adept and a Freemason (both incompatible with his status as Pope, but in tune with his actual status as late Magus: see Figure 61, page 379). That status in turn reflects the extraordinary background of the late Pope who, in the early 1940s was employed by the I.G. Farben chemical firm to sell cynanide to the Nazi regime for use at Auschwitz, having also worked as a chemist in the laboratories manufacturing the poison gas a nd malathion. After the war, this salesman, fearing for his life, had the bright idea, as did many other Nazis, of joining the Catholic Church, becoming an ordained priest in 1946. One of Karol Wojtyla's close friends was a Dr Wolf Szmuness, who allegedly masterminded experimental Hepatitis B vaccine trials conducted by the Center for Disease Control in New York, San Francisco and four other American cities in 1978-81, which may have been associated with the release of the AIDS virus. The Zyklon-B salesman was ordained as Poland's youngest bishop in 1958. He was elected Pope after his predecessor in the Va tican was assassinated when a nun offered him poisoned champagne.

The late Francois Mitterrand, who was close to the Rothschilds and was a leading Illuminati operative, as allegedly is President Chirac, appears on the list along with other named alleged Illuminati programmers - including King Juan Carlos I, the late McGeorge Bundy, the la te Bob Hope (slave owner and slave handler for intelligence agencies), Shirley MacLaine (actress, author, New Age occultist), Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Dr Michael N. Ryan, allegedl y one of the Illuminati's cover-up doctors who 'patches up' Monarch sex slaves, and Donald Trump (Illuminati). The list is given on pages 517-518. Craig Heimbichner's research has confirmed, inter alia, that, as indicated earlier, 'O.T.O. is indeed related to the Palladian Rite , which he calls 'Freemasonry's inner sanctum'. In other words, it is a direct descendant of the abomination established by Albert Pike in collaboration with Giuseppe Mazzini. This being the case, O.T.O. seems likely to be a means not only of spreading sorcery and phallicism more decisively and extensively into society, but also of ventilating the frustrations of Luciferians driven as always by the 'seething energies of Lucifer' at being 'cooped up' within the inner, inner circles of the Halls of Darkness of their own making. Alfred Kinsey (1894-1956), the 'sexologist' who abused hundreds of children in sex acts connected with his notorious 'research', and whose 'Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male' became the basis of modern corrupting sex education which has compromised traditional morality, acknowledged Crowley, of Ordo Templi Orientis, as among his most important sources of 'inspiration'. He was a guest at Crowley's Abbey of Thelema 'experimental studio' in Italy. In her book, 'Kinsey: Crimes and Consequences', the impec-"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan cable analyst Judith Reisman noted that Ki nsey 'included observational reports on the speed of reaching orgasm in 1,888 boys, aged 5 months to adolescence who were timed with a stopwatch', and '47 preadolescent girls' 80 . In the Talmudic Book of Ketubot 11b, it is laid down that 'If a grown man has intercourse with a little girl less than three years old, all agree that it is not considered a significant sexual act , for having intercourse with a girl when she is less than three years old is like putting a finger in an eye'. The prescription of Jesus Christ against the perpetrators of such abominations is without mercy. THE ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS FO CUS ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH In the Fifth Degree Rite of the O.T.O. ritual called 'Sovereign Prince of the Rose-Croix', a crucifix (a cross carrying the image of th e crucified Christ) is trampled underfoot, without these despicable creatures understanding that what they are actually stamping upon its itself prohibited ('thou shalt make no graven image') and an abnegation of the central Truth of Jesus Christ - namely that he died once and for all, for our sins, so that reiteration of and glorying in His suffering on our behalf by exhibition of his contorted body on the cross is perverse, and prohibited. One characteristic of the O.T.O. to which Heimbichner attaches exceptional importance is that of its 'double-mindedness', to which exte nsive reference has been made earlier. This is explained in the context of its approach to the Catholic Church. Specifically, 'the O.T.O. fosters an alchemically double-minded blend of awe for traditional Catholic ritual, and antagonism towards Rome; while keeping highly in terested in the direction of the Catholic Church and seeking to influence that direct ion wherever possible'. The reason for this particular manifestation of doubl e-mindedness is that it is the objective of the Illuminati, as was discussed in Chapter 6, to convert the Cat holic Church into the Universal Church of Man. With a Pope who communes with his 'predecessor' on the papal throne, O.T.O. operatives believe that this objective is approa ching realisation. After all, the Church of England has been 'successfully' st ripped of its spiritual content. So can the Church of Rome be far behind? In fact the O.T.O.'s focus on the Catho lic Church has always been in evidence, according to Heimbichner. For in stance, in 1903, follo wing the death of Pope Leo XIII, who had pronounced vigorously against Freemasonry, Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro, the Vatican's Secretary of State and a secret me mber of the Masonic Academy [sic], was ail but elected - when a veto was secured by an alert Catholic expert on occult conspiracy, Monsignor Ernest Jouin (Franc e). He managed to convince the Austrian Emperor, Franz- Josef, assisted by Cardinal Jan Puzyna, Bis hop of Cracow, that a veto was essential; so that the Cardinal invoked an ancient law, ca ncelling the election of Cardinal Rampolla. This was not a new experience: direct, confrontational Gnostic attempts to seize control over the Church - which, being a primary component of the Illuminati, has always remained 'mixed' and 'of two minds', torn be tween the Truth of Ch rist and its imposed pagan baggage - had occurred centuries earlier. Valentinus, an early Gnostic impostor, a ttempted to become Pope, fulfilling Simon Magus's ambition, while 'various Popes su ch as Alexander VI and Sixtus V have favoured occultic schemers' 81 , as reviewed in Chapter 6. The Vatican II Council began three weeks before the death of the O.T.O. outer high-priest Karl Germer on 11th October 1952. As it began, the O.T.O. conducted an occult ritual, using Egyptian sorcery, with a view to influencing the outcome of the Council. Heimbichner asserts that the O.T.O. finally 'got not one, but three of their own on the"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 469 Chair of Peter [sic], \"the Johns and the Pauls\" (John XXIII, named after an abominable predecessor for some unexplained and probably occult reason), Paul VI and John-Paul II 82 . That the O.T.O. appears always to have been specifically instrumental in the offensive against the Catholic Church - which the Illuminati consider 'their own' but seek impatiently to 'cleanse' of all remembrance of Jesu s Christ - is associated with its specifically Jewish and Swiss/Ge rman provenance. According to Heimbichner, a key operative in the establishment of the O.T.O. was the 'Jewish refugee' and B'nai B'rith activist, Dr Felix Lazerus Pinckus (1881-1947), a major player in the Zionist movement as President of the Zurich Union of Zionists 83 . The exclusively Jewish B'nai B'rith organisati on within Masonry was established in 1843 by Jewish Masons and by the leaders of other Jewish secret societies, including Isaac Roenbourg, William Renau and Reuben Rodacher. Pinckus became the 'spiritual mentor' of Hermann Joseph Metzger (1919-90), who later be came the head of the O.T.O. in Switzerland and of The Order of the Illuminati, or Ordo Illuminatorum (OI). It seems clear that Pinckus, a Swiss Jew, may actually have been overt head of the Illuminati. This would make perfect sense, since the affairs of the Illuminati are today coordinated by the Bilderberg organisation, based in Switzerland. BILDERBERG AS THE COORDINATING CENTRE Researchers are generally agreed (which ma y be dangerous) that the much-maligned Bilderberg Organisation is either the, or one of the central binding mechanisms serving to unify and coordinate the naturally fissiparous dialectical components of the New Underworld Order movement, that is to say, of the modern Illuminati. However the utmost caution must be reserved in reaching any such judgment, in view of the fact, admitted by Illuminati 'Fathers', that label-changing is routine, to maintain the level of secrecy considered necessary in order for this gigantic conspiracy against humanity not to be 'fatally' destabilised through exposure (which is what this book is all about). The other reason for exercising extreme caution in identify ing the seething core of the Black nexus is that, since the component secret societies and gr oups are criminal organisations or engage in criminal transactions and are the inventions and playthings of the Evil One, they are, by definition, constantly or potentially at loggerh eads with one another, since the Devil - as reiterated throughout this book - is the author of all confusion. ('For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace': First Epistle of Pa ul to the Corinthians, Chapter 14, verse 33). Moreover the scope for tension, envy and lethal competition has grown exponentially in recent years, with the non-stop creation out of th in air of fiat money funds running into the trillions of dollars which it is the central focus of some of the most powerful of the component criminalist groups to control and maximise. The mafia-style culture of omerta and ins titutionalised secrecy, which presupposes the tell-tale double-mindedness of all members of the synarchical Illuminati system, was verbalised by Weishaupt himself in one his more notorious statements to a corresponding secret colleague: 'One must speak sometimes one way and sometimes another, but so as never to contradict ourselves, and so that, with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable'. In reality, these people often take pains to contradict themselves - a particularly fine example having been publicised in 1993 when the former Russian Foreign Minister, the consummate Leninist Andrei Kozyrev, delivered two speeches in Stockholm on the same day, in one of which he ostensib ly spoke for the 'peace pa rty' and in the other for the 'war party'. Given their inherent double-"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"470 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan mindedness, Illuminists, from whatever co mponent of the synarchy, have no problem speaking out of both sides of their faces. More commonly, it is arranged for one collab- orator to say one thing, and for another to say the opposite, so that the public is confused and the truth is therefore deliberately consigned to the realm of speculation. Nevertheless, it is thought that the Bilderbe rg office in Switzerland not only provides a crucial coordinating service for the Illumi nati generally, but also acts as a strategic planning secretariat. Examination of the lists of participants at its annual meetings, leaked to certain researchers probably in order for the 'd ebate' surrounding this organisation to remain fragmented and therefore controlled, reveals that those who attend are invariably people with whom this Author, for instance, could never di scuss any of the issues raised in this book. Revealingly, attendees are bankers, industriali sts, senior officials from international institutions, a few political figures, certain European Royalty and 'Black Nobility' figures (see page 496), as well as 'favoured' entreprene urs into whose hands opportunities routinely cascade that are not accessible by others, and a sp rinkling of left-wing journalists. Some of these dubious characters are in reality 'Fascist s' dressed in left-wing clothing. A common feature of all of them is that their minds are closed - that is to say, their minds are governed by what the CIA calls 'slides' - prefabricated, controlled, dogmatic and 'politically correct' 'takes' on issues which preclude further analysis and consideration. The leaders among them use annual Bilderberg meetings, as well as other fora such as the annual January Davos meetings of the Geneva-based World Ec onomic Forum, established and convened over the years by an operative of Germanic Jewish extraction named Klaus Schwab, allegedly in part to vet and interview prospective or actual new recr uits to the nexus of the conspiracy, or else to familiarise Illuminati veterans with a broader range of controlled contacts. The architect of the Bilderberg organisation was a diminutive and scruffy Polish Jew called Dr Joseph Retinger, a 'High' Mason and the eminence grise who, working with Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands, agitated for structures which would foster the emergence of a United Europe. In 1952, Dr Retinger is said to have approached Prince Bernhard with a proposal for a secret conference to involve NATO leaders in open and frank discussions on international affairs behind closed doors. Such meetings would permit participants to speak their minds freely because no media representative would be admitted, nor would any news bulletin be issued about the topics discussed. In the same year, Retinger approached the Truman Adrninistration and briefed US officials about the pr oposal. Under the Eisenhower Administration, the Director of Central Intelligence, General Walter Bedell Smith, and C. D. Jackson, worked interactively with Eur opean counterparts to im plement 'Retinger's' plan. From the outset, the US promoters were heavily influenced by the head Illuminati family in the United States, the Rockefellers, ow ners of Standard Oil, competitors of Royal Dutch Shell. A Bilderberg draft document from 1989 recapitulated: 'Bilderberg takes its name from the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland, where the first meeting took place in 1954. That pioneering meeting grew out of the concern expressed by many leading citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together as cl osely as they should on matters of critical importance' [the 'cover story' for public consumption - Ed.]. It was felt that regular, off-the-record discussions would help create a better und erstanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations in the difficu lt postwar period'. A better understanding, or a deliberately moulded and skewed interpretati on of events and aspira tions consonant with the Illuminati's agenda?"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 471 In his Foreword to 'Joseph Retinger: Memoirs of an Eminence Grise' by Retinger's Polish sidekick, John Pomian [Sussex University Press, Chatto and Windus, London, 1972], Prince Bernhard attributed the establishment of the Bilderberg Group to Retinger, who mysteriously had the entree to Presidents, Prime Ministers and Royalty. At Retinger's funeral in 1960, Sir Edward Bedington-Behrens said: 'I remember Retinger in the United States picking up the telephone and immediately making an appointment with the President, and in Europe he had complete entree in every political circle as a kind of right acquired through the trust, devotion and loyalty he inspired'. Although of Jewish extraction, Retinger was, for public consumption anyway, a Roman Catholic (the Catholic Church being quintessentially Pharisaical) and was considered by many to be a Masonic agent of the Vatican, liaising in particul ar between the Pope and the 'Black Pope' in charge of the Society of Jesus. Prior to his intensive behind-the-scenes work in helping to leverage the establishment of the Bilderberg Group, Retinger founded the European Movement, which has operated for many years as a 'Fifth Column' network inside the EU 'Member States', undermining residual national sovereignty. His agitation led to the establishment, in turn, of the Council of Europe, on 5th May 1949. This organisation is today one of the main EU engines of socialist collectivisation. A review of who has been in charge of Bilderberg meetings over the years is instructive. According to the already cited 1989 draft Bilderberg document, 'the first (Bilderberg) meeting was convened under the chairmanship of (the former SS officer -Ed.) Prince Berhard of The Netherlands, who served as Chairman for 22 years. He was succeeded by Lord Home of the Hirsel, former Pr ime Minister for [sic: not 'of', but 'for'!] the United Kingdom, who chaired the meetings for four years. At the 1980 meeting, Lord Home turned over the meeting to Walter Scheel, fo rmer President of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1985, Mr Scheel resigned, and was succeeded by Lord Roll of Ipsden, President of S.G. Warburg Group Plc. At the 1989 meeting, Lord Roll turned over the chairmanship to Lord Carrington' - architect of the chaos in Zimbabwe. In this connection, the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list not only contains the names of President Mugabe and his second wife Grace, but also lists at least a dozen of the large farms which were seized by President Mugabe's thugs; and enquiries have revealed that these 'territories' may be located above rich mineral resources. With its headquarters in Strasbourg, the Council's Executive Committee provided Retinger with his first prominent platform for the promotion European unification. The widespread opinion that Retinger was inter alia an agent of the Vatican arose after he had suggested to the French Prime, Minister, Georges Clemenceau, that Austria, Hungary and Poland should be merged as a tripartite monarchy under the guidance of the Jesuit 'Order'; but Clemenceau, suspicious that this was a Va tican-inspired proposal, rejected the scheme outright. Retinger also intermeddled in North American politics -having gained the trust of the Mexican Government after playing a key revolutionary role in the creation of a Mexican trade union movement in the 1920s - by double-mind-edly persuading the Mexican authorities to nationalise US oil in terests in Mexico, and conducting secret negotiations with Washington on behalf of the Mexican Government. Given repeated penetration by activists of the meetings' arrangements, though not of its meetings themselves, the Bilderberg organisation has succumbed to the need to explain itself. Its 'line' is that the meetings are simply a simple forum for the sharing of views by prominent people from many countries, without fear of being reported. The privacy of the meetings just 'allows leading citizens to speak their minds openly and freely'."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"472 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan The former British intelligence agent John Coleman (technically a colleague of the Satanist Aleister Crowley) once asserted that the Bilderberg organisation coordinates the activities and relationships between what he thought were the three strands of the Illuminati - (1) the Communists (sometimes called the Wicca-Masons), (2) the 'Black Nobility', and (3) the Maltese Jesuits/Vatican , each of which component has the occult number of 13 representatives on the 39-membe r Board of the Bilderberg organisation, a command mechanism of the Bavarian Illuminati. Coleman asserted, with some justification given other evidence advanced here, that the Bavarian Illuminati created Bilderberg, which was established not by Retinger, who acted as coordinator, but by the former Nazi SS Officer Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands himself in 1954. It has its headquarters at 1 Smidswater, Den Haag, Netherla nds. Subsequent objective assessments have reconfirmed that the Board has 39 members, consisting indeed of 13 representatives from each of the three main secret groups comprising the Illuminari - but that the three ma in components consist of the (penetrated) Freemasons, the Vatican, and the 'Black Nobility'. It is this 39-member committee that functions all year round from its offices in Switzerland, from where secret financial transactions can be arrange d and monitored as necessary. The committee determines who shall be invited to the annual meeting and what policies, plans and strategies will be revealed there, and discussed. It is believed that every proposal or plan that has ever been discussed at an annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group has come to pass, usually within one or two years following the meeting in question. After Mrs Thatcher voiced her opposition to any further European integration in 1990, it was determined within the bowels of this control organisation that sh e should be removed from office - a task that was de facto duly undertaken by two of her formerly closest colleagues, the Europhile Lord Howe (formerly Sir Geoffrey Howe) and Lord Lawson. According to a British intelligence source, MI6, which has unhealthily close links w ith German and French intelligence, has been determined ever since then to rid the UK of the 'last vestiges' of 'Thatcherism' (for which this Author was partly responsible). Indeed this was revealed to the Author when he confronted the veteran journalist Gordon Thomas, in November 2004 concerning a tissue of lies which the journalist said had been disseminated to the British press about th e Author having been associated with Sir Mark Thatcher (whom he has never met) over the curious Equatorial Guinea putsch affair. The rationale given was that MI6 were 'e xpunging the last vestiges of Thatcherism'. OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS BEDEVILLED BY LIES AND FABRICATIONS Care has been taken by the German, American and British Information Warfare spe- cialists to ensure that discussion of these issues is always contaminated with lies and fabrications. These are easily id entified, and their purpose is to discredit those who are either brave or foolish enough to 'surface' into the public domain with 'opinions' on them. In order not to contaminate this work with such fabrications, two are mentioned here by way of illustration. The first is the perennially recycled lie that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and that their progeny is alive, well, and conspiring 'as we speak'. In summary, the fairytale asserts that Jesus survived the cross, married Mary Magdalene who bore him a son, and lived in seclusion in the South of France. During the fifth century, this lineage is said to have intermarried with the royal line of the Franks, giving rise to the Merovingian dynasty, from which today's 'Black Nobility' is descended. These gross fabrications hang, it will have been noticed, from the single lie that Jesus survived crucifixion, which of course presupposes that the Gospel accounts are them-"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 473 selves partial fabrications, or else contain pertinent disinformation. The lie also presupposes that after surviving his ordeal, Jesus abandoned his Ministry altogether in favour of married life. It is not worth expending time and energy researching these lies, not least because the sane analyst will at once discover glaring revisionist discontinuities, non sequiturs and gaps in any narrative using such material. Su ch analyses are usually devoid of notes and references, which should make the serious analyst suspicious. In short, these, and many related Information Warfare fabr ications, may safely and sensibly be rejected as reprobate, diversionary Illuminati impediments to understanding. A second piece of 'nonsense' to be found in open analyses of these issues is that the Illuminati are cooperating with 'aliens' to bring about their New World Order. Such low assertions are to be found in many sources, and they attract the attention of the unwary. However, in this particular case, the assertion masks a truth that the perpetrators know and seek both to promulgate and to disguise simultaneously. For 'aliens', read 'demons'. With the orchestrated perversion of the education system, so that Scripture is barely taught to children any more, young people know all about demons from the satanic diversionary materials that the Illuminati's collaborators have developed for them to play with - demonic videos, Black games, hellish 'comics', filthy, death- and pornography-oriented pop 'noise', film noir, and all the other grotesque perversions and evil things that the devils have invented in order to pervert and saturate children with the knowledge of evil. When the Information Warfare specialists' collaborators in sert disinformation to the effect that the Illuminati are collaborating with 'aliens', what they mean to convey - since they cannot disclose their evil inclinations - is that they are collaborating with demons. For it must be remembered that these people are not atheists. If they were, they would not believe in devils, and 'tremble' at the Name and power of Jesus Christ. THE REVEALING ISSUE OF THE KHAZARS* Given the intensity of the Information Warfare offensive, which is a primary preoccupation, for instance, of certain 'instructed' US intellig ence cadres, fabrications and lies like these have been deliberately inserted into analyses, with the objective of maximising scope for obfuscation of the issues that this book addresses. Such fabrications are particles of sand thrown into the air to assist the Illuminati with their obsessive imperative of trying to ensure that the leaking secrets of their conspiracy do not see the light of day. Their dissemination is of course facilitated by the deliberate strategy of exploiting the Internet and the 'New Age' of computer universality for Information Warfare purposes. The foregoing preamble was necessary, partly, in order to introduce the somewhat diversionary but perennially related issue of the descendants of the Khazars, as modern co mponents of Illuminati secret societies. The 'debate' surrounding this ethnic group is bedevilled by accusations that the subject is favoured by anti-Semites and other fanatical and hate gr oups and organisations in order to undermine the Jewishness of the Jews. * The information in this section is derived mainly from authoritative Jewish sources, including the work of the Hebrew History Federation, and from Khazaria.com. It is presented exclusively in order to clarify the confusion surrounding the issue of whether people calling themselves Jews r eally are Israelites, given that if they are not, the Khazars could be identified as those whom Jesus Christ condemned as blasphemers in Revelation Chapter 2, verse 9: 'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not but are of the synagogue of Satan'; and Revelation Chapter 3, verse 9: Them of the synagog ue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not but do lie'. If the Khazars are not Jews, it is then easy to extrapolate that these people are those of the s ynagogue of Satan. However it is shown here that the Khazars really are largely Jews. So when the Lord spoke of those who are 'of the synagogue of Satan' he was, as a lways, speaking spiritually, echoing Ezekiel [chapter 8, verses 12-18]: 'Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? For they say. The Lord seeth us not the Lord hath forsaken the earth'. These 'ancients' had 'their faces toward the Ea st; and they worshipped the sun toward the East... Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger.... therefore will I also deal in fury; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them'. These, then, are 'them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews (spiritually and according to the Law), and are not, but do lie'. The Word is always spiritual. The Khazar issue is therefore diversionary- another wave of sand thrown in our eyes."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"474 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan However the reality appears to be that these people are assimilated within the Ashkenazic Jewish population. The hypothesis that many present-day Jews are not of Israelite origin but are Khazars who adopted J udaism as opposed to the alternatives on offer (Christianity and Islam) is disputed by author ities, but insofar as it has resonance it can evidently only apply to Ashkenazim, who belong to one branch of the Jewish population. Khazar origin cannot be attributed to the Sephardim, or to the Teymani, Mizrachi, Bujharan, Indian, Ethiopic and other branches that constitute the other branches of the Jewish population which are undoubtedly of Semitic, Israelite origin. Jewish observers of this 'debate' assume a malevolent intent to split or otherwise compromise Jewry. The Ashkenazim are the heterogenous branch of European Jewry, excluding Jews from the Mediterranean area. Their generic name refers to the Jews dwelling in Mittel- europa, considered to be the land of Ashkenaz, with the term being later extended to dif- ferent Jewish communities including German, Polish, Scandinavian, Russian and Danubian Jews. The Mitteleuropean Jews lived (or sojourned) long enough in Germany, Austria and Bohemia to have developed their own language, Yiddisch, which in due course became a sort of offici al tongue of the Ashkenazim Jews, just as the Spanish Sephardim developed a peculiar language by mixing their own tongue with Spanish.

It controlled one of the most important trade routes between the Middle East and Northern Europe, and its civilisation influenced Eastern European peoples as far as the shores of the Baltic and the Danubian Basin.

Genetic tests have revealed that the As hkenazim are direct descendants of the Israelites, with DNA confirming their ancestry as derived from the Middle East. Such tests have also shown that Ashkenazim Jews are more closely related to Yemenite Jews, Assyrian Jews, Sephardic Jews, Kurdish Jews, and Arabs, than they are to indigenous European peoples, and that scant marriage or conversion has occurred to affect the homo- geneity of Jewish groups over the centuries. That phenomenon, in turn, is attributable by all observers to the 'legalised religion' taught by their Rabbis, the underlying purpose of which was always to maintain the people of Israel as 'a people apart', or 'a peculiar people', as commanded by the Lord: 'For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto hi mself, above all the nations that are upon the earth' [Deuteronomy Chapter 14, verse 2]; 'And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee; and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments [Deuteronomy Chapter 26, verse 18]. But in later centuries, the Rabbis picked and chose what commandments to follow, maintaining the elements of teaching which served their purpose of preserving the racial purity and homogeneity of the Israelites, but polluting the Torah with wayward Talmudic teaching derived from the Babylonian Kabbalah, the superstitions and perversions of Canaan, and elements of the 'Darkness' inherited from Egypt which the Lord had ordered them to discard. The Khazar royalty was descended from the Ashina Turk dynasty. In the ninth century, the Khazarian kings and nobility, as well as a significant proportion of the Khazarian population, embraced Jewish doctrines and beliefs, and actually adopted the hallmarks of Judaism, including both the Torah and the Talmud, the Hebrew script, and the observance of Jewish holidays. The presence of Jewish script in Masonic imagery, and the false 'Star of David' (which it is not) on the wall of the Great Queen Street Masonic Temple in London, for instance, are traceable to this historical background. When the Khazarian rulers converted to Ju daism, they attracted persecuted minorities from Europe and Islamic countries into their territory. Besides the Jewish population that was already living in Khazaria, a large number of Jews persecuted in the Byzantine Empire and other areas, fled into Khazaria, which beca me renowned for its freedom and prosperity - arriving from Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Balkans, Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and even from Western Europe, according to Jewish authorities (al-Masudi, Sa'adiyah Gaon and also the Arab writer Dimashqi), who wrote that these refugee wandering Jews offered their religion to the Khazars who 'found it better than their own and accepted if. Jewish immigrants soon outnumbered the native Jews of the Khazar Kingdom. After the fall of the Khazar Empire [see Figure 71, page 474], the Kievan Rus' took its place, ruling over its territory, which meant that a large number of Jews, bo th Khazars (who had adopted Judaism) and non-Khazars (descendants of immigrant Israe lities) became inhabitants of the growing Slavic-Varangian (Russian) state, and the Russi ans duly inherited most of the social system of the Khazar Kingdom. From the 11th century onwards, the havoc inflicted by the Crusades (which have, as we are all becoming more acutely aware these days, left lasting scars) upon the Jewish communities of Western Europe, induced a stream of German Jews to flee to the comparatively (then) free environment of the Sl avs: indeed, Russia was the most desirable place to live in those years. A further complication arises from the fact that the majority of Jewry which had until the Middle Ages lived under Arab rule, likewise fled eastwards to escape the Church's"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"476 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan satanic Inquisition in Spain, reaching Ukraine, Poland and Russia, where they encountered Jews who had been migrating there continuously since the 11th century. Most East European Jews had migrated, as mentioned, from the West to the East of the Continent, and were not descended from the inhabitants of the Khazar Empire. According to Jewish authori ties, they actually represent a fusion of Balkan-Greek Jews from the Byzantine Empire, Babylonian Jews from the Abbasid Caliphate, Yiddisch-speaking Jews from Germany, Sephardic Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition, and Kh azars. Obviously, all these groups intermarried over the ensuing centuries, so that the Khazar converts disappeared as a di stinguishable ethnic entity, and their descendants became more or less fully Jewish, with Israelite ancestry. THE 'BLACK NOBILITY' AS A COMPONENT OF THE ILLUMINATI To conclude the matter, the historical reality is that after the fall of their Kingdom, which fell in 1016 under assault from Viking armies (branc hes of the marauding peoples who attacked the British Isles and within a few generations had re-emerged as the Normans in France, England and Sicily), the Khazars intermixed mainly with the Kipchak (Kuman) populations and lost their character as a distinct pe ople. Several ethnic groups in the Caucasus (Karachays, Kumyks and Dhagestani tribes) have Khazars among their ancestors. A rebel Khazar tribe, the Kabars, of whom many were also Jewish, emigrated to Hungary and were assimilated by their very closely-related kin, the Magyars. In any case, the Hungarian Duke Taksony (955-970 AD) invited Khazar Jews to settle in his realm. For a while, though, Hungarian Jews did promote the proposition that they were themselves of Khazar rather than of authentic Jewish origin, so that they were hence legitimate Hungarians no less than Magyars; and it is possibl e that it is from this that the muddle over the Khazars originated. In reality , the majority of these people was of original Jewish stock. And it is true that the most strongly Khazar element within the Jewis h population is to be found among Hungarian Jews, descendants of th e last Khazars who fled into Hungary up to the 14th century, where they were, as indicated, received by their former v assals, the Magyar dukes and kings. Hungarian Jews are therefore definitely a fusion of Semitic German Jews, Khazars, Kabars and Sephardic immigrants who arrived in Hungary via Italy fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition, which (as can be seen) has had extraordinarily l ong-lasting consequences for humanity. As for the Jewish communities remaining in the former Khazar territories, they were assimilated by the Slavic-speaking Jews, and la ter by the Yiddisch-speaking immigrants from Central Europe, who outnumbered native Russian Jews - so that, again, the Khazar origin within Jewry was reduced to minority status and later disappeared through intermarriage. It is therefore concluded that there is indeed a Khazar component among many Eastern European Jews, but that it has been rendered irrelevant today as a consequence of intermarriage with the overwhelming majority of Semitic Ashkenazim. The most authentic descendants of the Khazars are found today among modern Hungarians, including many Hungarian Jews, and to a lesser degree, among Bulgarians in the Cau casus region. As discussed in the Note on page 473, the issue of the Khazars and their Jewish identity or otherwise is broadly irrelevant to our ongoing in vestigation into the identity of the Illuminati and the Synagogue of Satan. The confusion surrounding this issue is double-minded: on the one hand, Jewish 'nationalist' pr otagonists consider that the Khazar issue is an invention wielded by anti-Semites to diminish the proportions of the Jewish dias-"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 477 pora community; while on the other hand, proof that the Khazars are Jews would identify Jews as members of the Synagogue of Satan, which might appear superficially to undermine the integrity of the Lord's condemnations in Revelation Chapter 2, verse 9 -'I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan' - and Chapter 3, verse 9. But since Jesus spoke only of spiritual matters, he was of course referring to those double-m inded people who, on the one hand, purported to honour every minute detail of the Pharisaical Law (residual Mosesism), while on the other hand secretly engaging in the abominati ons perceived by the prophet Ezekiel, of sun- worship and perverted sexual and other abominations. Ezekiel's vision [Chapter 5, verses 12-18] is, as we have seen in Chapter 5, of a Masonic Lodge - which holds its meetings at night, faces East, and worships the false 'light' and the sun. There is a sizeable Jewish (Khazar) element within prominent European royal houses. For instance, the House of Hanover has always appeared to be German, but is in fact Jewish, as are other European Royal Houses, such as those of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern. Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands, whom some say is the head of the 'Black Nobility' families, is alleged to possess veto power over the choice of Pope, a privilege arising from his status as the head of the Hapsburg family, descended from the last Roman Emperor -the Hapsburg Frederick UJ having been the last Emperor to have been crowned in Rome: his great-grandson, Charles V, was the last to have been crowned by a Pope. Charlemagne's crown, a replica of which is part of the Imperial Hapsburg Regalia, is said to have borne the inscription 'Rex Salomon', according to the 'Encyclopaedia Brita nnica' [14th Edition, 1972, Crown and Regalia, Figure 2]. While remaining on guard against historical invention, revisionism and disinformatiorv one perception is that the Ha psburg House of Orange originated in France. The Hapsburgs were related through marriage with the Merovingians, thought by revisionists to have been descended from the Israelite Tribe of Benjamin, many of whose members went into exile (according to this 'line') following th e war with the other eleven tribes described in Judges, Chapter 21. In reality, that chapter makes it perfectly clear that the eleven tribes were reconciled with Benjamin, whose families continue d to dwell in their home territories after the reconciliation. Exactly how these distortions arose cannot be ascertained; but the myth of Jesus having married Mary Magdalene and that their offspring engendered the Merovingians is persistent among researchers who do not read Scripture, and who seem to think that the Franks were of Semitic origin. All this, and much more, is typically mixed up with the disinformation surro unding the Khazars. Another line of enquiry allocates the 'Black Nobility's primary derivation from the oli- garchic families of Venice and Genoa, who enjo yed privileged monopoly trading rights in the 12th century. During the first of three Crusades, lasting from 1063 to 1123, the power of the Venetian Black Nobility was established; and the aristocracy had secured complete control over Venice by 1171, when the appointment of the Doge was transferred to a Great Council consisting of members of the new banking and commercial aristocracy, including members of the infamous de Medici family. In 1204, the oligarchic families parcelled out feudal enclaves to their members. The term 'Black Nobility' is de rived from this mediaeval elite's routine resort to dirty tricks, secret assassinations, murder, blackmail, the bearing of false witness, the bankrupting of opponents or commercial competitors, kidnapping, child molestation, rape and all the other abominations that are routine among certain intelligence community cadres today. Although sources do not attribute drug-running to these families, it is inconceivable that drugs were not also among their specialities.

All the listed families are connected with the House of Guelph, one of the original Venetian 'Black Nobility' families. The Guelphs are so intertwined with the House of Hanover that the various connections would take pages to elaborate. Almost all European royal houses originate from the House of Hanover and accordingly from the Guelphs, f ountainhead of the 'Black Nobility'. Without reviewing the issue of rights to rule that 'Black Nobility' families continue to claim, the key point for our purposes here is that these people refuse to recognise any government other than what they historically consider to be their own 'divine right' to rule (handed down in the secular realm in parallel with the apostolic succession in the spiritual realm).

The drawing predicting a united West dates from the very early 1940s. In 1979, M.

Every European royal and so -called noble dynasty, past and present, has a representative on the 'Committee of 300' which, according to Dr John Coleman, was established in the 18th century, although its present form was assumed in 1897. Dr Coleman was unable to bring forward documentary proof of this Committee's existence, perhaps because of fear of assassination. But writing in a publication printed in Vienna (24th December 1921), the Jewish financial adviser to the Rothschilds and Socialist politician, Dr Walter Rathenau, stated that 'only 300 men, each of whom knows all the others, govern the fate of Europe. They select their succ essors from their own entourage. These men have the means in their hands of putting an end to [a ny] form of State which they find unreasonable'. Exactly six months later, Rathenau was assassinated. Among the old-line 'ruling families' which are not actually 'royal' at all but which consider that their Jewish ('Khazar') or Frankist lineage en titles them to ex officio or, at some stage, co- opted membership of the globalist ruling elite, with some still claiming descent from ancient and 'Holy' Roman Emperors, are the following dynasties: Rothschild, Kuhn, Loeb, Lehman, Rockefeller, Sachs, Warburg, Bush, Lazard, Sieff, Goldman, Schiff, Morgan, Schroeder, Harriman, and Du Pont (who actually consider themselves to be descended from Pontius Pilate). Other such families and patriarchs include the Giustiniani family, 'Black Nobility' of Rome and Venice who trace their lineage to the Emperor Justinian; the Hambro banking family; Pierpaolo Luzzatti Fequiz, with lineage dating back six centuries to the ancient Luzzattos, 'Black Nobility' of Venice; Umberto Ort olani, also from an ancient 'Black Nobility' family; the Doria family, financiers of the Spanish Hapsburgs; the French Rothschilds; the late Baron August von Finck; Franco Orsini Bonacassi, of the ancient Orsini 'Black Nob ility' that traces its lineage to an ancient Roman senator; the Agnellis; the Alba family; and Baron Pierre Lambert, cousin of the Belgian Rothschilds. Among these, there is not a single family that is not of Jewish/Khazar descent. The Oltramaire family (Swiss 'Black Nob ility'), owners of the Lombard Odier Bank, Geneva, are reported by a US military intelligence source allegedly to finance, historically and to this day, an a ssassination bureau located in Switzerland. US Amy G-2 records reportedly show this group has been heavily involved in the arms trade to the Middle East, and that it allegedly made no less than 30 attempts to assassinate General de Gaulle, the primary contact man being a certain Jacques Soustelle. He was also identified as the coordinator of the 'governing' Illuminati Committee of 300's transactions and relations with the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla group protecting the European Illuminati's Peruvian cocaine producers. In 1815, Jesuit agents and Freemasonic a llies among the crowned heads of Europe agreed, at the Congress of Vienna which put an end to the geomasonic depredations of Napoleon (a Masonic operative), that the inviolable neutrality of Switzerland, which had been decreed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, would be guaranteed in perpetuity - so that, irrespective of what wars are provoked by the Illuminati in pursuit of their objectives, the funds belonging to the 'Black nobility' lodged in Switzerland, would always remain free from the threat of plunder. This of course is why Switzerland remains in ex istence. The secret bank accounts of 'Black Nobility' wealth-holders have been joined by their 'successors', the crime families which, especially in the United States, have stolen and created (through fiat money multiplication techniques using stolen collateral) billions, if no t trillions, of dollars, and think that they are impregnable from prosecution for all time.

This nexus operates almost exclusively in the shadows, and has orchestrated a number of critical events in history. Its declared objective is the restoration of the Merovingian dynasty and bloodline in Fran ce and elsewhere in Europe, and it exerts pressure from behind the scenes for 'mor e Europe' ('greater ' European unity). Components of the Merovingian lineage, thro ugh dynastic alliances and intermarriages, include the noble and royal families of Blanchefor t, Gisors, Saint-Clair (Sinclair in Scotland), Montesquieu, Montpezat, Poher, Luisignan, Plan tard, and Hapsburg-Lorraine. The Prieure de Sion claims to hold the lost treasure plunde red by Titus in AD 70 from the Temple in Jerusalem, even though this treasure was depl oyed inter alia to construct the Colosseum. Furthermore, Roman Emperors could mint thei r own money and needed no help, after that example of Financial Warfare, from Jewish financial intermediaries. At all events, the 'Black Nobility' families, consisting of Jewish money-lenders who over time usurped the thrones which were inde bted to them, are prominent 'movers and shakers' among the synarchy. The award by Her Majesty the Queen of an honorary knighthood to George Bush Sr., allegedly perhaps th e biggest criminal operative in history, is sadly consistent with this analysis. And one feat ure of this research emerges time and again, to connect with the 'double-mindedness' characteristic of the Illuminati. It is that 'Black Nobility' figures, and their newcomer associates such as the Bush family, profess Christianity, but may secretly despise it. In a treatise on 'The Order of St John of Jerusalem' (1986), Dr John Coleman wrote that 'as an example, we find the atheist Lord (Peter) Carr-ington, who pretends to be an Anglican Christian but who is a member of the Order of Osiris and other demonic sects, including Freemasonry, installed as a Knight of the Garter at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England, of the Black Nobility Guelphs, and head of the Anglican Church, which she thoroughly despises'. Dr Coleman is among those who have argued that the 'Christianity' of these people is false, just as was the professed Christianity of the Spanish Jews who 'converted' in order to save their skins in mediaeval Spain, and that they derive their 'spiritual' intake from occult-Judaic Freemasonry. This is hard to square with the evident humility and devotion to Jesus Christ of Her Majesty, but not hard to recognise, possibly, from the behaviour of certain other prominent members of Britain's Royal Family. The reality of its extensive Jewish antecedents (increased by the Bowes Lyon family of which the late Queen Mother wa s a member) does not, of course, preclude the possibility of members being True Christians , as The Queen appears to be, even though her Anglicanism may perhaps be simple (yet commendable). Not only could Dr Coleman not document the existence of the Committee of 300, but also, likewise, his assertion that The Queen despises the Church of England could never be proven. However given that the Church of England has abandoned its role of instructing the people in the Way, the Truth and the Life, and has gone a-whoring after many of the abominations forbidden by the prophets of the Israelites, this Author would be sympathetic to Her Majesty if she does indeed despise Anglicanism. But supporting Dr Coleman's argumen t is the sad reflection that the serially reprobate behaviour of Anglican clerics has not, apparently, been corrected by The Queen as Head of the Church. Her Majesty has not a ppeared to exercise her authority to reprimand them*. * Indeed, in the course of an interview given in the first quarter of 2006, Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wh en asked point- blank whether he believed in God, responded: 'If by believing in God you mean is he sitting in the chair opposite me as you are , no'. That is not the correct answer, which is: 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and is come in the flesh' - for which statement Christ promises that all who utter it in sincerity are saved. Dr Williams' first act on being perversely 'selected' for consecration as Archbishop by Tony Blair for confirmation by The Queen, was to attend a Druidic ceremony in Wales, in which he was co-opted into the highest Degree of the Druids. Druidism is o f course wholly incompatible with True Christianity, so this man is an impostor."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 481 AN EXPOSE OF ILLUMINATI TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES In 2002, an interview with an unnamed 45-year-old female defector from the Illuminati cult named 'Svali', a registered nurse and freelance writer living in Texas, was disseminated on the Internet. Earlier (in March 2000) 'Svali' had started writing a monthly column for survivors of Illuminati programming ritual abuse, which was disseminated at Suite101.com. This site contains a great deal of weird and esoteric material and for this reason cannot be considered a reliable source. In December that y ear, H. J. Springer, Editor of a separate site, CentrExNews.com. contacted the Illuminati defector and conducted an interview with her by email. On 14th October 2002, Henry Mackow Ph.D. published an article citing excerpts from 'Svali's' comments. Dr Mackow's Internet s ite is listed (in the author's view, incorrectly) among those suspect websites considered by Finton Dunne (www.BreakForNews.com) in Ireland to be directly or indirectly influenced or controlled by intelligence input. Such sites are usually identifiable by the lack of specifics (names, addresses, locations) and properly referenced source notes, a tell-tale feature of many intelligence sites which exist for the purposes of managing, distorting or confusing public perceptions (mass Psy-Ops). Many of them contain little more than 'rants' and dubious research. But Dr Mackow's work is always of high quality, and clearly in pursuit of truth. Even so, Finton Dunne appropriately implies that he and his colleagues are uncertain which websites are directly and which are indirectly controlled, and that some may be disseminating confusion and diversion entirely unwittingly and innocently [see Note 3]. The usual procedure, given today's officially promoted environment of Information Warfare, is for accu rate information to be intermingled with inventions and disinformation. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that intelligence cadres surprisingly exist that rightly consid er the planned New Underworld Order, which is micro-managed by collaborating and competing intelligence communities, to be an abomination, and that these people exploit their own propaganda outlets to issue warnings to those capable of disentangling disinformation from fact, concerning what is intended.

See also Figure 72."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"482 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan With these cautionary observations in mind, this Author nonetheless attaches importance to statements by 'Svali' as diss eminated by Dr Mackow, because they are cor- roborated by separate information, including critic al admissions by the very senior lllaminati rel ative of a US colleague. It is unlikely that Dr Mackow has allowed himself to be deceived, and it is probable - not least because of corroborating information in this Author's possession - that the 'Svali' intelligence is genuine. Indeed it could hardly be otherwise, considering the risks always run by 'traitors' to the ruthless Luciferian Illuminists. After considering all available evidence, especially information provided first-hand from a member of a very well-known generational Illuminati family concerning the behaviour of this satanic caste, the Author is certain of the accuracy of the insights provided by 'Svali'. Quite simply, they are corroborated by separate information. 'Svali', according to Dr Mackow et al, wa s a mind programmer for the Illuminati until 1996, and was ranked as the sixth trainer at the Sa n Diego branch of the Illuminati, in charge of 30 trainers who reported to her. Note that the source speaks directly of the Illuminati as a structured cult, with no reference (anywhere else in her testimony) to any of the other secret societies and sects, such as O.T.O., that we ha ve been discussing. Since we have identified a late head of an occultic entity specifically calling itself Ordo Illum-inatorum (The Order of the Illuminati) in Switzerland, the existence of this organisation, whether under this title or some cover or other, cannot be in doubt. Note the use of Latin, a habit 'borrowed' from the Jesuits and consistent with the practice among other members of The Order. Dr Mackow reported that 'Svali' had risked her life to warn humanity of the Illuminati's covert power and agenda (begging the question, of course, as to whether Dr Mackow's own report might court similar consequences. According to this source (followed by this Author's elaborations where he has something to add): 'She describes a sadistic satanic cult led by the richest and most powerful people in the world. It is largely homosexual and paedophile, [and] practices animal sacrifice and ritual murder. It works hand in glove with the CIA and with Freemasonry'. Crucially, Dr Mackow added here: 'It is Aryan supremacist (German is spoken at the top) but welcomes Jewish apostates.... It controls the world traffic in drugs, guns, pornography and prostitution' 84 . Thus the CIA serves these international criminals. Author: All the statements here are corroborated by the Author's own research and by knowledgeable sources consulted for this work , including the late Dr Malachi Martin who specifically told the Author in 1996 that ritual murders took place 'four blocks from where we are sitting' every other Sunday on New York's East Side. The primary sources of Illuminati funds are pornography (the potential of which has been leveraged via the Internet, in an intelligence-controlled operation based at Boca Raton, Florida), child prostitution, gun- running, the worldwide hire and sale of assassinations, the provision of mercenaries and military training experts, corrupt banking operations, and drug-trafficking. In this context, 'Svali' confirms that the Latin American cartels established by US intelligence, and spearheaded inter alia by Carlos Lender, the son of the Nazi fugitive Wilhelm Lender, as discussed in Chapter 3, were in fact, from the outset, operations of the Illuminati, fronted by the CIA and other elements of the vast US intelligence apparat. This explains, therefore, why William Colby had to inform his successor, W illiam Casey, that he had continued, long after ceasing to be Director of Central Intelligence, to direct certain hyper-sensitive operations in Latin America. It seems clear fr om Casey's Affidavit [see Chapter 3] that he may not have understood that this was an Illuminati operation; and since Colby was subsequently 'suicided' in a tributary of the"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 483 Potomac, his awareness of Illuminati involvement is unknowable. Since he was engaged, before being liquidated, in publishing an intelligence newsletter, his handlers may have decided that he was liable to reveal secrets which might lead to their exposure.

'[The Illuminati Sect] has infiltrated government on a local, state and national level, educational institutions, religion, and the medi a. Based in Europe, it plans a 'World Order' that will make its earlier atte mpts, Nazism and Communism, look like picnics. One other detail: These people are not happy'. Author The 'World Order' that is to be imposed (or rather, we who are not parties to this madness are indoctrinated into believing will inevitably be imposed) is to be The Order imposed by the 'New World' in accordance with the Rosicrucian 'remit' symbolised on the Great Seal of the United States, as envisaged by Sir Francis Bacon et se q. In other words, the United States is the military and occult instrument serving the interests of the European Khazar Dark Forces which relaunched this venture in the 18th century. The Author has encountered unnaturally virulent hatred for Europeans among certain intelligence cadres (members of which have exposed themselves, as these people usually do). Interestingly, this hatred is usually focused either against Britain or else against Germany, often depending upon the ethnic provenance of the Americans in question. The British, it seems, are especially hated: and there may be 'reason' for this. Concerning these Illuminati operatives being 'not happy', that is a consequence of (a) their double-mindedness and (b) the fact that they are (or feel) trapped in their Luciferian hell from which what remains of their 'better selves' would prefer to escape. But Satan is especially adept at setting traps for the unwary: and in the case of these Illuminati dupes, the traps are lethal. The interview elaborated: 'Svali's' courageous testimony explains why our children are no longer taught civic values, why they are being habituated to homosexuality and violence, and why our 'culture' is descending into nihilism and sexual depravity. It raises the possibility that George W. Bush and his Administration are Illuminists...'. Author: Certainly, they are. As for the depr avity that is being taught to children, in defiance of Our Lord's furious warning that those who do these things to His little children should be thrown with a rock tied round their necks into the deep, the perpetrators continue these activities at their peril. Vengeance is exclusively the Lord's; and when it comes, the vengeance that he will certainly reap upon a ll who have and continue to abuse children, will be terrible indeed. Mr Springer checked a number of 'Svali's' statements with e-mail messages from people who have been ritually abused , raped, sexually abused people... some of them confirming to me her story'. Further st atements from the interview included the following: # 'The Illuminati are present in every majo r metropolitan center in the United States. They believe in controlling an area through its banks, local government, the legal profession, and the local media'. Jobs allocated within the cult include those of: Informers (who are trained to observe details and conversations with photographic recall); Breeders (chosen from childhood to breed and have children, often selected according to bloodlines, whose children are rarely used in satanic sacrifices); and Prostitutes, trained from an early age to give sexual favours to one or more adults: according to 'Svali', 'ch ild prostitution is big business for the cult, and training very young children in this role is taken very seriously. Child prostitutes are also used to blackmail po litical figures or leadership outside the cult'); Pornography actors (with Illuminati"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"484 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan children being trained in this role from preschool onwards - the parents receiving payment or favours within the cult in return for selling their child); Media personnel - sent to journalism school and trained within the cult to write books, articles, screen plays or whatever, sympathetic to Illuminism, without ever revealing their true affiliation; Helpers at rituals, who 'clean up meticulously after rituals, scouring and raking the site, and are trained to set up tables, cloths, candles and magick paraphernalia quickly, as well as being taught from an early age to dissect animals (and, 'S vali' says, humans condemned for sacrifices); High Priests and High Priestesses, who administer and lead the local cults, coordinate jobs, organize satanic events, report to higher levels, and officiate at ceremonies; trainers, such as 'Svali' herself, who train local group members in their assigned jobs, and report to the High Priest or Priestess; Punishers, who brutally punish and discipline members breaking Illuminati rules or acting outside their authority ~ such 'punishers' being universally despised by other cult members and normally two or three in number per group; such people will employ any method deemed 'necessary' to prevent a recurrence of the undesired behaviour; Trackers, who track down and keep an eye on members attempting to leave their local groups, and who are taught to use dogs, guns, taser, and all modern tracking techniques; they are also adept at using the Internet to track a person's activities - tracking credit card usage, cheques written, and whatever snooping opportunities come to hand; Teachers, who instruct childre n, to indoctrinate Illuminati cult philosophy, languages, and other areas of endeavour; Child Care specialist s (infant care workers) who look after very young children while adults are at local group meetings - described by 'Svali' as 'usually quiet and coldly efficient'; Couriers, who run guns, money, drugs or illegal artefacts across state and national lines, trained to use firearms to get out of difficult situations; Commanding Officers, who oversee military training in the local groups, and control and coordinate military-related jobs; and Behavioural scientists, who are, according to 'Svali', 'intensely involved in data collection and human experimentation in the name of the pursuit of knowledge of human behaviour in the scientific realm' (Himmlerism). 'Svali' adds that these people 'are almost universally cold , methodical, impersonal people who will employ any methods to study trauma and its effects on the human personality. Their main interest centers around implementing programming and cu lt control in the most efficient and lasting manner'. Concerning the existence of Illuminari groups in larger US cities, friends of the Author have recently confirmed not only the accuracy of this statement, but that the pattern is replicated in smaller towns as well. The Order of the Illuminati literally 't ook off' in the United States with the geomasonic American Revolution, although 15 Lodges of the Illuminati are known to have been established earlier in the 13 Colonies. The Columbian Lodge of the Order was established in New York City in 1785. • 'The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as \"enlightenment'. It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers that their roots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt and Celtic Druidism. They have taken what they consider to be the \"best\" of each, the foundation practices, and have joined them together into a strongly occult discipline. Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as 'El', 'Baal' and 'Ashtarte', as well as Tsis and Osiris', and 'Set'. I do know that these people teach and practice evil'. Author: Confirmed. • Extensive Illuminati mind-control and training takes place at military bases hidden in remote, isolated areas or on large private estates: 'Briefly, each region of the United States has \"nerve centers\" or power bases for regional activity. The United States"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 485 has been divided up into seven major geographical Regions. Each region has its own Regional Council, composed of 13 members, with an advisory board of three elders to each one. The bases are used intermittently to teach and train generational Illuminati in military techniques, hand-to-hand combat, crowd control, use of arms, and all aspects of warfare. Why? Because Illuminists believe that our government, as we know it, and other governments, are destined to collapse... There w ill be a military takeove r, region by region'. The first such 'experiment' occurred in New Orleans in 2005. Author: The kind of mind-control operations referred to includes Himmlerian Illuminati abominations such as those descri bed in Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips' cited work, 'Trance Formation of America'. Concerning the division of the United States into seven regions, we should not be surprised that this breakdown diverges from the Federal Government's division of the country into ten regi ons, a device that neatly hides the 'validity' of the seven Illuminati regions. On the basis of the Federal Government breakdown, the New Orleans area is part of Region Six. The Illuminati Region covering New Orleans includes Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. Following scalar-promoted Hurricane Katrina, a large number of pre-prepared Executive Orders were implemented, providing for the seizure of power supplies, personal vehicles, food supplies, water supplies, the banks, transportation equipment and systems, and even the Amtrak station which was converted into a prison. A US Navy ship sat outside New Orleans, jamming communications, in accordance with one of the Executive Orders. Some weeks after this catastrophe-atrocity, Vice President Richard Cheney paid a visit to New Orleans, in the course of which he uttered the following Freudian slip: 'We are on top of this exercise'. With this statem ent, this top CIA operative and Illuminist blew his and the Illuminati's cover, for the Katrina atrocity provided the pretext for the first regional military takeover - as predicted by the Il luminati defector, 'Svali'. It was significant that Senator Mary Landrieu, of Louisiana, initially supported what the Federal Government were actually 'doing' in her area. However on 28th October 2005, she paid a visit to New Orleans, and appeared on television flanked by four pastors. In the course of her remarks, she criticised the Federal Government multiple times, for its 'criminal' behaviour. In other words, she had become aware that these Illuminati maniacs are actually engaged, 'as we speak', in their progressive region-by-region 'takedown' of the United States - or an 'exercise' to test the programme. FACT In May 2006, it was announced that Cornell University scientists have dis- covered 60 billion barrels - three times more than current US recoverable oil of 20 billion barrels - off the coast of Louisiana, bringing US reserves up to 80 billion barrels of oil, on a par with Venezuela. The reserve is twi ce the size of North Sea oil discoveries. • 'The Supreme World Council exists as a prototype of the one that will rule when the New World Order comes into being. It meets on a regular basis to discuss finances, direction, policy etc, and to problem-solve difficulties as they arise. On this Council, the Rothschild family in England and in France have ruling seats. A descendant of the Hapsburg family has a generational seat. A descendant of the ruling families of Britain and France have generational seats. The Rockefeller family in the United States holds a seat'. • The Illuminati leadership state that they are descended from royal bloodlines, as well as unbroken occult heritage. See, there are two definitions of 'royalty'. Open roy alty that is currently seen now, and 'hidden royalty' of royal lineage and extreme occult power. I never thought of which country/line he ld the most power, since I was just a peon busily doing my job.

Definitely they rule the UK branch under the Rothschilds in the occult realm, even though Parliament rules the country openly. In France, again, descendants of the royal families are also the power in the occult realm, but the French Rothschild s hold the reins over all of them'. Author. The participation of royalty and the high-born in this global criminal activity is at first sight hard to reconcile with the stat ed revolutionary objective of abolishing all monarchies. However one must (a) take account of the fact, yet again, that these people are double-minded; and (b) certain prominent mo narchies were alre ady 'cooperating' Illuminati centres, too powerful to be overthrown and much more useful in situ -although the constant sniping at the British Royal Family may imply otherwise. In that context, the pressure comes from the Grand Orient 'line' of Illuminist Freemasonry, which was responsible de facto for the decision to exec ute the French King; and those concerned have never reconciled themselves to the fact that the British Monarchy has prospered and grown more powerful ever since. This is an interesting example of Illuminist plans going awry or being modified, or abandoned. The British Royal Family is in any case buttressed by both German an d Jewish/Khazar bloodlines. # 'The United States is considered lower, and younger, than the European branch es. Germany, France and the United Kingdom form a triumvirate that rules the European cult The USSR [significantly, 'Svali ' continued to refer to the 'former' USSR as 'the USSR'- Ed.] is considered important , and has the strongest military groups. The USSR has been promised fourth position in the New World Order, BEFORE the role the United States would have, because th e USSR has been more helpful and cooper ative over the years with furthering the agenda........... The USSR is going to get stronger again. It has too strong a military, both overtly and covertly, to sit quietly on the side. All Illuminati military trainers have visited Russia to learn from them. In the New World Order, they will be stronger than us'. Author: Aggressive, Na zi-style US behaviour under th e Bush II Administration may imply that the United States is jealous of this Uluminati pecking order and seeks clandestinely to reverse it. Ot herwise, the statem ents correspond to what the Author and colleagues have been told by several informed sources, including a very 'high' US occult Uluminati source with very clo se ties to Germany. This source warned that 'the Europeans are fighting it out among themselves' and that it would be 'unwise to get in their way'. This insight has resonance in view of the tensions known to exist between Britain on the one hand, and France and Germany on the other, which cam e to the fore after British intelligence intercepted evidence of French (fronting for German) complicity in the 7/7 atrocities. Gerhard Schroder, the outgoing German Chancellor, conspicuously arrived late for a banquet at Downing Street hosted by Tony Blair on 27th October 2005, and arrived half an hour late at an EU conference organised by the British Presidency at Hampton Court during the same visit. His public observations were unhelpful and rude; and even making allowance for the fact that he was leaving the scene, they revealed the irritation of German intelligence at having been 'roughly spoken to' by the British in July - a state of affairs that awaited its possibly dramatic denouement following confirmation that a fifth bomb had been intended to be detonated under the Thames inside the Northern Line Tube tunnel. It is significant that the high-ranking Illuminati cult member who told the Author's contact that the European powers 'are fighting it out among themselves', made this comment following the London atrocities on 7th July 2005."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 487 • In answer to the question: is the Illuminati a Jewish conspiracy? 'Svali' gave the fol lowing initially surprising answer, which pe rhaps fails to take account, for instance, of the backgrounds of many of the Nazi lead ers, or that the Holocaust was associated with venal warfare within the Jewish community which was exploited by the German Illuminati leadership - given that there were at least 155,000 Jews who were in the Wehrmacht, and a significant number of leadi ng Nazi officials, su ch as Eichmann and Wachter, were of Jewish extraction; but 'Svali's' answer is given here to ensure that the context is complete: \"Absolutely not. In f act, Hitler and his people, especially Himmler and Goebbels, were top Illuminists. The Illuminati are racist in the extreme, and as a child, I was forced to play \"concentration camp\" both on my farm in Virginia, and also in Europe at isolated camps in Germany.... There are some very powerful Jewish people in this group. For instance, the Rothschild family l iterally runs the financial empire in Europe. I have also known people whose parents were Jewish diamond merchants in the group, and at every level. But to rise to power in the Illuminati, a Jewish person at night would be forced to renounce their faith, and to give their first allegiance to Lucifer and the beliefs of the Illuminati. In return for this betrayal, they believe that power (financial) and rewards flow; and in one sense they do, but at too high a price' (losing their eternal soul). Author 'Svali' fails to understand that Zi onism is Fascism. Many make this mistake. • 'The Nazi/concentration camp mentality is very strong, though, and I was told that Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and others were high-ranking members of the muminati (Himmler was higher than the other two), and Mengele their paid puppet as well, who later worked as a high trainer of the American branch between his periods of hiding in South America. They honestly believed that they were acting as agents of their 'gods' to exterminate the Jewish race'. Given the clim ate then favouring eugenics and 'ethnic cleansing', and given also that Zionism (Fascism ) is racist, it was sa tanically logical that these ruthless people saw fit to apply thei r 'ethnic cleansing' formula to their own. Author. A system of concentration camps has been in place in the United States since the second half of the 1990s. See the Second Appendix to Chapter 8, page 612. • As to whether these people are all racist: 'Lots of Illuminists have Fourth Reich programming inside [them]. The Illuminati are racist and have a very \"Ayryan\" outlook. They believe strongly in the role of the 'pure' and 'intelligent' by their own definitions, and in their ceremonies; there will occasiona lly be minorities killed in ceremonies'. Author: One of these people, evidently an American CIA operative working from Dublin, where there is a large CIA colony, telephoned the Author out of the blue in June 2003 and proceeded to discuss Scripture. At first, what he had to say was sound and in accordance with the Author's understanding of the Word. But gradually, this unsolicited intervention veered away from the truth. The operative started insisting that Eve had had sex with the serpent and that the product of that union was all the coloured peoples of the world, whom he implied were inferior. When the Author protested and attempted to close the conversation the operative suddenly asked: 'Can you 'speak in tongues?\" Whereupon he started to 'demonstrate'. What came out of his mouth was a stream of unintelligible demonic gobbldegook. He was able to turn this stream of verbal tripe on and off, which he did three times. At the end of these demonstrations, he ordered copies of ALL the Author's publications, shouting: 'I want everything you produce, do you hear me? I don't care what it costs'. There and then, he proffered his Credit Card details. The Author arranged for a large parcel of materials to be sent to him and duly debited his Credit card, as instructed. Presumably all this material was sent to Langley."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"488 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan • 'Genetics: They are trying to breed a 'gen etically superior' race to rule, with their children and descendants.

They believe th at the occult leaders are 'enlightened and intelligent' [Illuminated], while the average person is a sheep, to be led by the nose'. In the text published on the Internet, 'Svali' explained that 'after the military takeover (for which 800+ US concentration camps, capable of holding up to 15,000,000 people have been established: seepages 612-613), the general population will be given an opportunity either to espouse the cause of the Illuminati, or else to reject it, on pain of imprisonment or other penalties, including death. 'These people very much believe that the intelligent, or \"enlightened\" or Illuminated, were born to rule. They are arrogant, and consider the general population as \"dumb sheep\" who will be easily led if offered strong leadership, financial help in an unstable world economy, and dire consequences if the person rebels. Their utter ruthlessness, and ability to implement this agenda, should not be minimised'. Author: Reports of long-term experiments aimed at the creation of life itself, so that God need no longer exist, which have resulted in th e generation of beings with multiple arms and legs that are kept in cages deep undergro und at certain locations in the United States, have proliferated in recent years, following leaks by appalled intelligence observers. All such abominable 'work' is derived from the Sefer Yetzirah, the oldest text of the Kabbalah, highlighted in a German expressionist film of the 1920s by Paul Wegener called 'The Golem' in which Rabbi Loew (a 16th century Rabbi of Prague) consults the Kabbalah, draws a magic circle and conjures a demon to bring a 'Golem' to life. Craig Heimbichner points out that at Brandeis University 'attempts were recently made, backed by DARPA, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to create artificial life, beginning with attempts to \"evolve\" robots. The title of this military intelligence project is: 'The Golem Project: Genetically Organized Lifelike Electro Mechanics'. Other US agencies involved with the Golem Project are NASA, the Office of Naval Re search, the Department of Defense, and the National Science Foundation. Portions of this information have been leaked and featured on National Public Radio (NPR), BBC News, and even NBC and ABC. Leaks of such 'information' test the trance state of the public and deepen it if the public submits without protest to the disturbing signals - an observation which this Author considers to be a coherent explanation, also, of part of the rationale for the publication of Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips' awful book, 'Trance Formation of America', in which detailed descriptions of organised abominations and programming operati ons against innocents, and of the alleged depravity of named senior US officials, is relentlessly described. The search for a Man- controlled key to the creation of life, which would crown Man's usurpation of the place of God, was supervised in the United States by the Satanist and O.T.O. leader of the Agape Lodge in California, John Whiteside Parsons, co-founder of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a.k.a. 'Jack Parsons Lives'), who called himself 'Antichrist Belarion'. He was caught in the homosexual rape of a 16-year-old boy in 1942, and invoked the forces of Chaos before each rocket test. For two generations the abominations committed by the United States in dropping nuclear bombs on Japan have been justified as 'hastening the end of the war'. Parsons' crowning achievement was to attempt to create a 'Mannikin', a vision of Crowley's that was to be representative of life created by Man (but one who was demon-possessed).

According to Downard, Jumbo contained an inanimate body, which was inunda ted with nuclear energy, with a view to creating a real homunculus, an objective of mediaeval alchemy. Heimbichner surmises that foetal tissue will have formed part of this 'Mannikin' or some part of it, given the 'overlapping activities of both Parsons and his government part ners'. Note that such activities parallel the horrific experiments on human beings and with the human mind and human tissue, perpetrated by Himmler's scientists - whose r eception in the United States complemented Black activities already being undertaken by the US Government. • On Freemasonry, 'Svali' commented: 'T he Freemasons and the Illuminati are hand-in-glove.... Al exandria, Virginia [see Figure 74 on page 489], is named after Alexandria, Egypt [which is to be one of the two centers of global control, the other being Brussels']. 'Svali' says: 'A new system of monetary exch ange, based on an international monetary sys tem, and operating between Ca iro, Egypt, and Brussels, Belg ium, will be set up. There is a center in the Washington DC area for Illuminati scholarship and training'.... Author: Which 'illuminates, does it not, a ll those otherwise semi-incomprehensible goings-on at 'The Cedars', Arlington, discussed in Chapter 6. • Are all Masons Dluminati? 'No, especially at the lower levels. I believe that they know nothing of the practices that occur in the middle of the night in the larger Temples' - as was the case in the time of Ezekiel [Ed.]. 'The group help ed to create Freemasonry as a front for their activities'. Author: This is supporte d by research published in this book. • Concerning Illuminati penetration of the US structures: 'The CIA and the FBI are all infiltrated. So are the Mormons [and other cults) . Many of the administrators and directors of the FBI are also Illurninists. Th e CIA helped to bring over German scientists after World War II. Many of these people were also IUuminati leaders in their own country, and they were welcomed with open arms by the US group. They funnelled all the information from their research to the Illuminati.... Th is is truly an intern ational group, and its agenda supersedes any nationalist considerations. There is also a lot of trading back and forth in these groups. A Russian trainer might come to the United States for a while, complete a job, and then go back, or vice versa'. • With reference to Illuminati personnel, 'Svali' explained that 'most of them are w ounded, abused victims, who don't realize that it is possible to leave the group. There is a lot of discontent in the ranks, and there would be a mass exodus if the members believed that it were really possible to get out (and live). Many of the trainers I knew (wicked, torturing paedophiles) were NOT happy with what they did. They would whisper quietly, or give a look, to show that they disagreed with what they had to do. They would resignedly do their jobs, in the hope of advancement. Do you know that one of the biggest carrots offered to those who advance up the group is that you don't have to hurt people any more, and that you can't be abused? It's true: only those higher up than you in the group can abuse you, so everybody wants to move up, where the pool of candidates becomes smaller. Of course, people can choose to abuse anyone beneath th em, and that motivates. The Illuminati are a very political and back-stabbing group, [havi ng] a 'dog-eat-dog' mentality. Everyone wants to move up. These are NOT nice people, and they use and manipulate others viciously. They cut their eye-teeth on status, power, and money 85 [idolatry, and consequent hell on earth - Ed]."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 491 MODERN ILLUMINISM STARTED WITH THE GERMAN ROSICRUCIANS The testimony of 'Svali' concerning the origins and power centers of the Illuminati also checks out with the detailed research presented in this book. She wrote that 'modern-day Illuminism... started with the German branch of the Rosicrucians', 'spread to England, then came to the United States with the first settlers'. 'The Illuminati have three main branches: The Germanic Branch, which oversees the others - confirming the accuracy of this book's analysis; The British Branch, which handles finances; and the French/Russian Branch. All three of thes e Illuminati branches are represented in both the United States and Canada, as well as in every country in the world'. The likelihood is that the 'rats-in-the-sack' syndrome applies, as these evil forces are constantly, and inevitably, being servants of Lucifer, at cross-purposes. According to 'Svali' all Illuminati banking tr ails 'will eventually lead to Belgium, the Illuminati financial centre of the world' - an insight borne out by the presence in Brussels of the main institutions of the German long-range strategic deception apparat called the European Union, and of the handlers of global control finances. 'Svali' also listed the main 'power centers' of the Illuminati in the United States. Noting that they originally entered America via Pittsburgh, PA, she reports that they spread from there all over the country. In the year 2000, there were 18 US cities that were (and are) used as 'power centers' - meaning both practical and occult power, not just 'power' in the usual political sense of the word, including the following cities/areas: Washington DC, and the surrounding area; Albany, New York; Pittsburgh, PA, Winston Salem, Raleigh 'Golden Triangle' area, North Carolina; Minneapolis; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Wichita, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Flagstaff, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; Houston; Los Angeles and surrounding areas; New Orleans; and Springfield, Mississippi. Other cities, adds 'Svali', are important to the Illuminati - funnelling mo ney, conducting research and cooperating with Regional Illuminati Councils. Given that these 'Dark Actors Playing Games' have given themselves up to Satan, the Great Deceiver - so that none of th em can ever trust anything that an y of their Illuminati colleagues say or do, which is why they are frequently at loggerheads with each other, and always w ill be, and why they always make a mess of their Luciferian schemes, as a further corollary of which all their plans will certainly lead to destruction and perdition - an especially revealing feature of these reprobate lost souls and 'self-deceived 'Useful Idiots' is that they usually appear to be charming and perfectly normal, up to a point. As 'Svali' pointed out, they 'never openly disclose their agenda, or their cult activities, since they are often actually amnaesic to them. These may be well-respected, \"Christian\"- appearing business leaders in the community. The image in th e community is all-important to the Illuminist'. Their Jewish-Kabbalistic inspired 'religion' is, after all, as Craig Heimbichner has taught us, 'a religion of the Do uble Mind'. 'Svali' continued: 'They will do anything to maintain a normal , respected facade, and they DESPISE exposure. None of the Illuminists that I have ever known had unkind, or evil appearing, personas in their daytime lives, although some were dysfunctional, such as being alcoholics. The dissociation that drives these Illuminists is their greatest cover. Many, if not most, of these people (by day) are completely unaware of the great evil that they are involved in during the night' - just as the elders of ancient Israel who performed abominations in the dark, reported by the prophet Ezekiel and referred to earlier, were probab ly 'decent' and upright leaders of their communities by day. Nothing whatsoever has changed, apart from the magnitude of the problem."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"492 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan THE JEWISHNESS' OF 'THE ORDER' AND 'KOL NIDRIM' On the face of it, the most problematical issue arising from 'Svali's' testimony concerns her remarks about the key role of the Jews inside the Illuminati. Since, as we have seen, the 'Black Nobility' component of the Illuminati is essentially Jewish/Khazar or with Jewish antecedents, the Illuminati and the penetrated Masonic 'pedigree' and focus that has been described is essentially Jewish (and the furthe r our investigations are developed, the more direct Jewish kabbaJistic influence emerges), why is it that this defector says that this is not a 'Jewish' operation (driven by the 'seething en ergies' of Lucifer')? The answer to this simple question is complex: 1. In the first place, the Jews are divided amongst themselves. 2. The promoters of diabolical occult kabbalism and sorcery are a small minority among the Jews, who in almost all other respects are entirely compatible with the societies within which they live. Any discussion of these subjects among level-headed, intelligent Jews will expose the absolute revulsion of such sober people for sorcery and the abom- inations, condemned in their own Torah, that take place in Masonic Lodges and Temples, and in the secret societies of Jewish-inspired Rosicrucian kabbalistic Illuminism. 3. The tendency throughout the centuries has been for sorcery and related abom- inations to hide behind 'respectable' facades wherever possible: hence, for instance, the self- imposed occult century of secret silence of the Rosicrucian 'line' between 1617 and 1717, and the later penetration and conquest of Freemasonry by the Rose-Croix. The one exception to this tendency appears to have been the establishment of the O.T.O. in 1902/1917. Therefore, a presumption persists that the ch erished image of respect ability (as discussed above) must be retained at all times. The logic of this would suggest that, since the source of these abominations is Jewish Babylonian kabbalism (arising from the 'wrong turn' that the official Jews took at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ), there must be continuing pressure within the Illuminati to mask this provenance, which 'merges' with the intense desire for the cover or respectability. 4. Betraying their faith and pretending that their oaths, vows and undertakings can be overlooked and rendered null and void, are two specialities of some Jews. They did this in Spain, on the advice of the Constantinople Sanhedrin, when ordered by King Ferdinand to convert to Christianity or to leave the country. They evidently, according to 'Svali', do this in the Masonic Temples when participating in abominable rituals at dead of night, in the manner observed by Ezekiel. As for giving themselves absolution for the sins which they know perfectly well they have committed, they have a Jewish Talmudic prayer called 'All Vows' ('Kol Nidre'). It is based on the following declaration in the Talmud, which is itself a perversion of the provisions for atonement laid out in Leviticus: 'He who wishes that his vows and oaths shall have no value, stand up at the beginning of the year and say: \"All vows which I shall make during the year shall be of no value\". The logic of this, of course, is that any vow a Talmudic Jew makes to the Lord of Hosts is, by definition, vulnerable to being decapitated by a recitation of 'Kol Nidre', which means that Talmudic Jews can have NO SPIRITUAL LOYALTY TO GOD WHATSOEVER. On the contrary, such a Jew may consider that he can simply recite 'Kol Nidre' in order to escape from any vows he may have foolishly made to Satan in the darkness of the Masonic Lodge at night - only to discover that Evil Spirit binds him so that he cannot escape, as he thinks he can escape from any vows to God. Originally conceived as a 'backward look' over the failures of the preceding year, 'Kol Nidre' quickly became a forward look anticipating all the deceptions that would be"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 493 deliberately planned in the forthcoming year. This, of course, is the basis of the Bolshevik-Leninist 'line' that any agreements reached with the 'bourgeoisie' (Goyim) can be breached and unilaterall y annulled at any time. In 1919, a more extended version of 'Kol Nidre', for use on the Day of Atonement, appeared in print. It reads as follows: 'All vows, obligations, oaths or anathemas, pledges of all names, which we have vowed, sworn, devoted, or bound ourselves to, from this Day of Atonement, until the next Day of Atonement (whose arrival we hope for in happi ness) we repent, aforehand, of them a ll; they shall be deemed absolved, forgiven, annulle d, void and made of no effect; they shall not be binding, nor have any power; the vows shall not be reckoned vows, the obligations shall not be obligatory, nor the oaths considered as oaths' 86 . This tradition of annulling vows and undertakings before they are even consummated was not, as Jewish apologists have argued, a consequence of the abominable treatment meted out to the Jews under the (Jewish) Je suit-inspired Spanish Inquisition, when they were treated so viciously in the name of the gentle, meek and loving Jesus. On the contrary, a formula to invalidate Jewish vows is found in the Talmudic prayer book of Rabbi Amram Goun, who lived in the ninth century, a good 500 years before the Spanish abominations - although Rabbi Amram's formula was called 'Kol Nidrim' ('All vows and oaths which we shall swear from Yom Kippurim to Yom Kippurim will return to us void'). To be fair, it is NOT the case that all Jews deliberately assassinate their pledged word: but the Talmud and their Talmudic prayer books permit them to so, and advises them how to accomplish the annulment of th eir undertakings, which pre supposes that when drawing up agreements they reserve at the back of their minds the 'right' to renege should they decide that to do so would be in their best interests, and that they can over ride domestic law in some way or another. This, of course, means that undertakings reached generally with Jews following the Talmud cannot necessarily ever be re lied upon - a point exploited by Lenin, who taught his associates that any agreements reached with the 'bour geoisie' (code for Gentiles, or Goyim) could 'legally' be abrogated unilaterally by the Revolution at any time, should the 'correlation of forces' demand such an annulment in the interests of Leninist revolutionary strategy. 5. As an obvious and pertinent corollary to the above, we find ou rselves yet again face- to-face with the primary ch aracteristic of the Illuminati, highlighted by Craig Heimbichner, which provides such an invaluable insight into 'the mystery of iniquity': the double-mindedness of the Illuminati. This is evident from the two-faced behaviour of its members, who present as respectable, even agreeable, citizens 'by day', and as practictioners of evil 'by night'. This double-mi ndedness is associated with the characteristic that has disturbed this Author most, when observing the behaviour of these people - namely, the propensity of some of them to switch suddenly from open-ended charm, to unabridged nastiness, anger, or both. Such 'switches' often occur in a nanosecond - so that the person you thought you were dealing with has changed in an instant into someone from whose presence it becomes imperative to depart. The 'Kol Nidrim' culture is of course wholly consistent with this malevolent schizophrenia, since, by definition, the Talmudic Jew who enters into an agreement knows, albeit us ually subconsciously, that he always has the option to renege on his undertakings. It should not be construed from this that this Author assumes that undertakings with Jewish parties are invariably suspect: but this is a feature of the culture of both Talmudic Jewry and the Illuminati which accounts for the contradictory phenomena encountered in the course of this study. It also, incidentally, accounts for the Soviet Communist literature"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"494 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan on 'contradictions' which may otherwise be inexplicable to students of Leninism: see for example the Soviet compendium 'Foundations of Marxism-Leninism', in which the central role of 'contradictions' in the formulation and 'rolling ouf of strategy is discussed. Synarchy (rule by secret societies) presupposes double-mindedness, and of course highlights the duplicity inherent in the familiar accusation that investigators such as this Author are 'conspiracy theorists' (although, curiously, the Author has not actually faced this accusation). Lenin himself wrote that the Revolut ion - an operation of the Illuminati - is a conspiracy. Since secret societies exist, conspiracy is dearly ubiquitous; so the 'conspiracy theorist' insult is yet another diversionary lie promulgated by the double-minded conspirators themselves. Likewise, over-mighty criminalists occupying official positions believe that their own serial criminality (including their drug and money-laundering operations) can conveniently be masked by posing as dedicated crusaders against crime. PROOFS OF THE CONSPIRACY No expose of the Illuminati, however incomple te (as this necessarily is) can close without mentioning the first two that were publicly distributed - Professor John Robison's 'Proofs of a Conspiracy', published in 1799, and the Abbe Augustin Barruel's four-volume study, 'Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism', published in 1799, some months after the first appearance of Robison's book. Both these observers - one a lapsed member of Weishaupt's Illuminati and Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University, and the other a French priest - writing in different countries and in different languages, without the one knowing the other - covered essentially the sa me subject-matter and came to the very same conclusions. As the Introduction to the American Classics Edition of 'Proofs of a Conspiracy' 87 observes, therefore, 'we have two excellent works which tell us virtually all we need to know about the origins of history's most diabolical, long-ra nge conspiracy'. It is a basic rule of journalism, not always easily realised, that if possible one should have two sources for every statement. Because Robison wrote, of course, in English, albeit necessarily in the 18th century style, English-speaking students have tended to us e his analysis, given the added problems of translating stilted 18th century French into plain language (although the Abbe Barruel's prose is in fact easily absorbed). Robison, disillusioned by his encounter with the Illuminati, possessed what is sometimes referred to as a 'hin terland'. For instance, he was a close friend of James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, who described Robison, at his death in 1805 aged 66, as 'a man of the clearest head and the most science of anybody I have ever known'. In 1783, Robison had been elected General Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: so he was one of the leading intellects of his time. The Order of the Illuminati, formally reorganised in 1775 by Adam Weishaupt, a lapsed Jesuit of Jewish extraction and Professor of Canon Law at Ingolstadt University, Germany, was the front man for the 'Dark Actors Playing Games' of the day - a gopher, who, on instructions from 'high adepts', especially including the then head of the Jewish Rothschild (Red Shield) family, elaborated the strategy of promoting Illuminism through Masonic Lodges, which were protected by sworn secrecy, 'grafting the new Order of the Illuminati, at selected points, onto Freemasonry - like a fungus' 88 . The primary working motto of The Order was that the end (ostensibly the happiness of the human race but in fact the control-lust idolatry of 'the Brotherhood') always justifies the means. That The Order of the Illuminati was intended to embrace the entire world, was evidenced by Weishaupt's own definition quoted in the 'Larousse Grande Dictionnaire' published in 1873, in which he was quoted as having said that the goal of"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 495 Figure 75: The cover of the classic 1798 expose of the Fr eemasons, Illuminati and R eading Societies, by the University of Edinburgh's Professor of Natural History, John Robison.

Neither expert knew each other, but both covered the same subject matter and came to the same conclusion.

The reference to 'diversity' provides c onfirmation of the origin of the mindless imposition of 'diversity standards' by UK and US Government Departments at all levels of governance and official structures, replicated within multinational corporations worldwide. It explains, for instance, why, at a railway station such as Union Station in Washington DC, one is liable to hear announcements read out by a female Hispanic announcer whose accent and mode of expression are so excruciatingl y awful that hardly a single word of what she says can ever be understood. She is employed for that job, despite the fact that she is totally unsuited for it, for 'reasons of diversity' 90 . Weishaupt may have developed his adaptation of the much older concept of an elite cadre of 'Illuminati' from his knowledge of the secret splinter group within the reprobate Jesuitical Order calling themselves the 'Alumbrado s' (the 'enlightened ones') created by the founder of the Society of Jesus himself in Spain, Ignatius Loyola. This splinter society taught another form of Gnosticism, asserting that the trappings of formal religion were unnecessary for those in receipt of 'the light'. This would make sense if 'the light' in question was to be that of Jesus Christ; but evidently these reprobates had 'another Jesus' in mind. The Spanish Inquisition, itself designed by Loyola, actually issued edicts against the 'Alumbrados' in 1568, 1574 and 1623. Weishaupt wrote that, with the rationalisation of his new manifestation of the 'Illum inati', he incurred 'the implacable enmity of the Jesuits... whose intrigues he exposed'. No doubt they hate d him for this, not leas t, because this 'act of exposure' consisted of rank plagiarism : the initiation methodology and Degree system that Weishaupt developed for his revamped 'Illuminati' Order was modelled precisely along Jesuit lines, complete with its regime of oath-bound secrecy and its integral internal system of permanent spying on one's 'brethren'. Indeed, Weishaupt was almost certainly chosen for this remit by the Rothschild family because of his Jesuit training and deep understanding of how that 'Order's Luciferian methodology worked. In a letter dated 1794, Weishaupt wrote that 'the great strength of our Order lies in its concealment. Never let it appear in any place in its own name, but always covered by an other name, and another occupation. None is better than the three lower Degrees of Freemas onry; the public is accustomed to it, expects little from it, and therefore takes little notice of it. Next to this, the form of a learned or literary society (the Thule Soci ety) is best suited to our purpose.... By establishing reading societies and subscription libraries... we may turn the public mind which way we will. In like manner we must try to obtain an influen ce in... all offices which have any effect, either in forming, or in managing, or even in directing the mind of man'. In this passage, Weishaupt confirmed that his Illuminati sect would piggy-back on the 'Blue Degrees' of Freemasonry, for the purpose of absorbing and controlling them and exploiting this penetration in pursuit of its long-range objectives: exactly the method used by the Leninist Communists and, in the United Kingdom today (as of 2006), by the sinister official 'Fifth Column' revolutionary 'mental mapping' organisation run out of a central Whitehall Government office called 'Common Purpose', by a Civil Service Head of Personnel Selection, a Mrs Julia Middleton. She 'moonlights' as head of the enormous"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 497 'Common Purpose' personality manipulation network, which is systematically training a brainwashed revolutionary cadre throughout all tiers of Government, the prison service selected components of industry, banking, and other sectors of the political economy. Members of The Order of the Illuminati were required, John Robison explained, to swear blind obedience and submission to their superiors - exactly as required within the Jesuitical system - with an oath (forbidden by Jesus Christ) that reads in part: 'I bind myself to perpetual silence and unshaken loyalty and submission to The Order, in the persons of my Superiors' (Weishaupt even used the same terminology as the Jesuits); here making a faithful and complete surrender of my private judgment, my own will, and every narrow- minded employment of my power and influence' 91 . To blindly submit one's will to the power of another - in this case, the Evil Force hiding behind the Superiors of The Order - is an act of extreme madness and unmitigated folly, since we were specifically given Free Will by the Lord so that we may exercise it, not least to choose between good and evil. Note the use of the word 'narrow-minded': so- called 'Europhiles' in the United Kingdom, having no intellectual arguments of any validity on their side in favour of their discre dited and redundant support for Britain's satrap status within the German-controlled European Union [see Chapter 8], are apt to resort to sloganeering and insults, one of which is that those of us who believe in national independence and self-determination, are 'narrow-minded'. In addition, 'members were required to sp y on one another and to submit reports and autobiographies which could compromise them, should they decide to leave The Order' 92 . In other words, Adam Weishaupt imposed upon his 'new' reprobate Order precisely the same diabolical control mechanisms and spying incubus as that so notoriously employed within that originating, parallel Illuminati orga nisation, also not coincid-entally calling itself 'The Order'- the blasphemously mislabelled Society of Jesus. Figure 78: Summary of the 'higher Degrees' of the Illuminati as organised by Professor Adam Weishaupt, a reprobate former Jesuit of Jewish extraction, reproduced by Professor John Robison in his classic expose of the Illuminati, 'Proofs of a Conspiracy' [see Figure 77].

(According to Robison, Weishaupt 'created' eight Degrees, but some authorities speak of nine). Each step of the way was carefully plotted and planned by Weishaupt and his colleagues, building on the traditions developed within the earlier versions of th e sect, so that the 'squeamish' and gullible never rose higher than the lowest Degrees, while the bold, ruthless and cynical - all who were ready and willing to dispense totally with the vestiges (as they saw it) of Christianity, morality, patriotism and any other hindrances, rose to the top 93 . [Figure 78]. 'It was through this process of selection and careful inculcati on that Weishaupt, in a mere decade, was able to gather into his Order the cleverest and most diabolical minds in Europe. The true purpose of The Order was to rule the world. To achieve this, it was necessary for the Order to destroy all religions, overthrow all gover nments, and abolish private property. In order to accomplish this, it would be necessary to convince enough people that religion, governments, and private property were the real obstacles to human happiness'. Weishaupt organised the Order of the I lluminati within the Lodge Theodore of Munich, as a secret organisation within a secret organisation. Robison 'examined the state of Freemasonry within Germany, where the Illu minati aberration originated. He describes the schisms within German Freemasonry, the grea t fascination [there] with mysteries [i.e., the occult], the widespread influence of Deism - the philosophy that the universe is creating God, rather than the reverse' (an interesting variation on the Devil's usual trick of turning everything upside down and inside out) 'and such Utopian ideas imported from France as cosmopolitanism, or world citize nship, and finally the strong influence of French Masonic practices and doctrines through the Lodge of Lyons, the mother Lodge of a segment of Masonry known as the Grand Orient de la France' 94 ' Given that the revolutionary doctrines pressed by the Illuminati Order were zealously propagated, the existence of this secret societ y within a secret society (the pattern used by the Illuminati to hide their existence ever since, in one way or another), could not remain hidden for long. In 1783, a Bavarian Court of Enquiry started an investigation into The Order; and much of what is known about the massive conspiracy that Weishaupt fronted, is a consequence of that investigation. The Ba varian Court of Enquiry exposed and banned the Illuminati Order, which then went underground again, emerging as a network of Reading Societies all over Germany. This operation represented the Illuminati's first attempt to control the media - as the literary Reading Room network sought to monopolise editorial work, publishing reviewing and the distribution of all literature, in order to control the minds of the intel- ligentsia. At the same time, the Illuminati exploited the printed word to subvert the minds of 'the masses' - a precursor of its later annexation of film, theatre and today the entire entertainment industry, augmented by the electronic leverage potential through the Internet, for the same purpose. Indeed, the methodology employed by th e Illuminati cadres has never changed throughout this 'final' assault by Lucifer - which is intended to achieve a decisive victory over 'the enemy' as the culmination of the 'Permanent Revolution'. It will certainly fail."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 499 CONTROL OF THE MEDIA INTE GRAL WITH THE CONSPIRACY Independent corroboration of the evil intent of representatives of the Illuminati to annexe and control the Fourth Estate is available, thanks not least to excellent research conducted by Dr Dennis Laurence Cuddy, and published in his book 'Secret Records Revealed: The Men, the Money, and the Methods Behind the New World Order' 95 . Dr Cuddy records that on 9th February 1917 - not uncoincidentally the year in which the O.T.O. emerged into the open and the Russian Revolution occurred, resulting in the establishment by the Illuminati of their first large-scale 'Black Regime' - Representative Oscar Calloway inserted the following statement in the Congressional Record: 'In March 1915, the J. P. Morgan interests, the steel, shipbuilding, and powder interests, and their subsidiary organisations, got together twelve men high-up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press of the United States. These twelve men worked the problem out by selecting 179 newspapers and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of twenty-five of the greatest newspapers. The twenty-five papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy (i.e., control) national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by th e month; and an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit informa tion regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers' 96 . Dr Cuddy further reports that on 24th March 1917, 'The New York Times' published the text of a telegram from Jacob Schiff descri bing the Russian Revolution as 'what we had hoped and striven for these long years'. And on 3rd February 1949, 'The New York Journal- American' reported that Today it is estimated even by Jacob's grandson, John Schiff, a prominent member of New York Society, that the old man sank about $20,000,000 for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Russia. Othe r New York banking firms also contributed' 97 . These references to the financing of the Bolshevik Revolution by New-York based Jewish bankers is included here in order to highlight the parallel relevance of Figure 84 on page 533, in which the signature of Adolf Hitler appears on the same document as that of Max Warburg, the brother of Paul Warburg, who was the chief architect of the Federal Reserve System. The combination of these two pieces of evidence shows how Western Jewish banking funds were used to finance the first Black Illuminati regime, the Soviet (International Socialist) Union under the German agent Lenin, and secondly, the German National Socialist Black Illuminati regime - thus establishing the two sides of a dialectical process ripe for manipulation to procure the emergence of an environment condu cive to the German- Jewish llluminati's mad objective, the establis hment of a 'New World Order'. The question is: is this to be the 'Order' imposed by the 'New World' as envisaged originally, under older German influence, by Sir Francis Bacon and the European controllers of the founders of the United States, or the New World Ordnung, or Thousand-Year Reich, which is what the controlling German Illuminati centre has in mind? In 1928, William Paley established the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and hired a nephew of Sigmund Freud, the Jewish 'Father of Psychiatry', named Edward Bernays, as his main adviser. Bernays published a study entitled 'Propaganda', which"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"500 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan contained this further confirmation that the I lluminati have imposed their grip on the US media - and of course, as is today so glaringly obvious, on the British media as well: Those who manipulate the orga nized habits and opinions of the masses constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of the country.... It remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons.... It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.... As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for in visible government has been increasingly demonstrated...' 98 . Given universally heightened concerns to day at the perennial failure of the open 'mainstream' media in both the United States and Britain to investigate and report the proportions of institutionalised financial, drug-running and money-laundering criminality and theft that has become routine, and wh ich the Author seeks to expose in his serial publications, it is sobering to learn that these anxieties are nothing new at all. HOW THEY HANDLE EXPOSURE: 'NO-ONE WILL BELIEVE IT' The Author experienced at first-hand how the Illuminati seize control of desirable media outlets. In the 1970s, he was in the habit, thanks to the good offices of the then Editor of The Daily Telegraph, the veteran pol itician-turned-journalist W. H. Deedes, of writing extensive Op-Ed Article s which were frequently published in the centre pages of that newspaper. This continued satisfactorily for a number of years: indeed, the Author was instrumental in helping the Conservative Pa rty to understand that the trade unions were labour cartels; and Bill Deedes told the Author one day that 'you taught me that trade unions are financial corporations'. In March 1979, shortly before Mrs Thatcher came to power, the Author was invited to brief the Shadow Ca binet on this subject, where he encountered resistance from one of the darkest char acters who surrounded the incoming Prime Minister, Leon Brittan, and from an accountan t ally of Mrs Thatcher who became Lord Wakeham (subsequently allegedly caught up in the Enron scandal). After some years, Conrad Black bought the newspaper and other titles from the then proprietors, the Berry Family. As is well know n, Lord Black, as he duly became, was, many years later, involved in a scandal over the removal of funds within his complex, Maxwellian corporate structures, which were in part presided over by the sinister characters Dr Henry Kissinger, the German Jew with the Soviet codename BOR, and Richard Perle, the man known in Washington as 'the Prince of Darkness'. Within a very short space of time following Black's takeover of the newspaper, all the Op-Ed writers, including the Author, were 'sacked': or rather, it was made crystal clear that further contributions would not be welcome. But these arrogant I lluminists who perpetrate these scams always forget that it can never be guaranteed that their deeds wi ll not become known, since 'nothing is hid'. The experience taught the Author how the Ul uminati work, and corroborates, of course, the documented evidence published by Dr Cuddy. In the course of her interview with Dr Mackow, 'Svali' noted: 'The Illuminists don't care who prints this stuff, or if they are 'exposed ' - because they are counting on the majority not believing it, having done a pretty good job wi th a media blitz campaign: seen any articles in Newsweek or Time lately, that address [any of] this other than as a laughable conspiracy theory?' 99 . However the days when the control-freak Princes and Powers of The Darkness can rely on no-one believing how depraved they are, may be numbered."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 501 THE PRE-POSITIONING OF CONTROLLED ILLUMINATI OPERATIVES One of the primary methods used over the decades by the Illuminati to advance their conspiratorial objectives has always been to surround leaders by its proteges or advocates - such as Leon Brittan, one of the most evil-lo oking men the Author has ever seen, who was clearly prepositioned into Mrs Thatcher's entourage before she took power. It will be recalled from our examina tion of Jesuit methodology that The Order (Jesuit manifestation) concentrated considerable re sources on befriending potentates, princes and wealthy women (whom they especially cherish, given their expectation that, in due course, they will become wealthy widows who can be encouraged to hand their wealth over to the Order before their death). Exactly the same (Jesuit) grasping and control methodology is deployed routinely by The Order of the Illumi nati. Adam Weishaupt stated plainly that the Illuminati's plan was to surround ruling aut horities with members of The Order so that its representatives would be as close to seats of power as feasible and, through close influence and if possible actual occupation of the highest offices, to usurp such power directly. Thus he instructed: 'These pow ers are despots, when they do not c onduct themselves by its [the Order's] principles; and it is therefore our duty to surround them with its members, so that the profane' (that is, Illuminati- and Freemasonic-speak for the rest of us who haven't been initiated into their evil ways and don't go along with their arrogant plans) 'may have no access to them. Thus we are able most powerfully to promote its interests. If any person is more disposed to listen to Princes than to the Order, he is not fit for it, and must rise no higher. We must do our utmost to procure the advancement of the Illuminati into all important civil offices' 100 . To lay long-term plans as devious as this, one must surely indeed be possessed. THE DETAILED HISTORICAL BACKG ROUND ACCORDING TO ROBISON Robison revealed in his own introduction to his work that the Illuminati survived their 'abolition' by the Bavarian Court of Enquiry, in the following passage: '... abolished in 1786 by the Elector of Bavaria, [the Order of the Illuminati were] revived immediately after under another name, and in a different form, all over Germany. It was again detected, and seemingly broken up; but it had by this time taken so deep root that still subsists' (as of 1798 when Dr Robison's book was published) 'wit hout being detected, and has spread into all the countries of Europe. It took its first rise among the Freemasons, but is totally different from Freemasonry. It was not, however, the mere protection gained by the secrecy of the Lodg es that gave occasion to it, but it arose naturally from the corruptions that had gradually crept into the fraternity, the violence of the party-spirif (i.e., the 'seething energies of Lucifer)' which pervaded it, and from the total uncertainty and darkness that hangs over the whole of that mysterious Association' 101 . Freemasonry originated in England, which has accordingly cursed the whole world by inventing this system of secret Lodges wh ich have been converted into transmission mechanisms for the dissemination of the 'Anc ient Mysteries' and the degradation of civilization. Robison observes at the outset that he had detected indications of extensive intermeddling by Jesuits in Masonic Lodges in the 17th century: 'I have met with many particular facts, which convince me that... at this time' (referring to the English Revolution and the Ci vil War period) 'the Jesuits interfered con- siderably, insinuating themselves into the Lodges, and contributing to increase that religious mysticism that is to be observed in all ceremonies of The Order'. And Robison"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"502 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan had observed, too, that the Jesuits used all sorts of ruses and label-changing tactics to enhance their power and influence: 'This Society is well known to have put on every shape, and to have made use of every mean that could promote the influence and power of The Order' (Jesuit version). 'And we know that at this time they were by no means without hopes of re-establishing the dominion of the Church of Rome in England. Their services were not scrupled at by the distress ed Royalists, even such as were Protestants, while they were highly prized by the Sovereign' 102 . When, following the English Revolution, King James II took refuge in France with many of his most zealous a dherents, his entourage took Freemasonry over to the Continent, 'where it was immediately received by the French and was cu ltivated [there] with great zeal. The Lodges in France naturally became the rendezvous of the adherents to their banished King, and the means of carrying on a correspondence with their friends in England. At this time also the Jesuits took a more active hand in Freemasonry than ever. They insinuated themselves into the Englis h Lodges, where they were caressed by the Catholics, who panted after the re-establishment of their faith, and tolerated by the Protestant Royalists, who thought no concessi on too great a compensation for their services. At this time changes were made in some of the Masonic symbols... which bear evident marks of Jesuitical interference' 103 . This was nothing new, for in an earlier era, 'in all this progressive mummery we see much of the hand of the Jesuits, and it would seem that it was encouraged by the Church' 104 . Lodges held at St Germain's added the Degree of Chevalier Macon Ecossois to the three 'symbolical' or 'Blue Degrees' of English Masonry, providing a connection with the 'alternative theory' that the author of the complex kabbalistic 'mummery' detailed in Manly P. Hall's rare work, cited in Chapter 6, may have been the 'Count of St Germain' - a title sometimes used as an alias of Sir Francis Bacon himself, notwithstanding that Bacon had been dead a good century or more by the time the Lodges were meeting at St Germain. 'It is certain', Robison elaborated, 'that before 1743 ... the Lodges of Free Masons had become the places for making proselytes to every strange and obnoxious doctrine. Theurgy, Cosmogony, Cabala, and many whimsical and mythical doctrines which have been grafted on[to] the distinguishing tenets and pure morality of the [Torah] Jews and Christians, were subjects of frequent discussion in the Lodges', and the ferment in the French Lodges 'fully account for the zeal with which all this patchwork addition to the simple Freemasonry of England was prosecuted in France' 105 . One of the 'daughter Lodges' of the Lodge at Lyons, the Lodge Theodore von der guten Rath, at M unich, a centre of occu lt activity through to the era of Hitler and beyond, 'became so remarkable for discourses dangerous to Church and State, that the Elector of Bavaria, after repeated admonitions during the course of five or six years, was obliged to suppress it in 1786' along with Weishaupt's Order of The Illuminati 106 . Citing the 'Archives Mystico-Hermetiques', Robison notes the subtlety with which gross heresies and sorcery were alluded to, which 'accord with a general spirit of licentiousness in morals, religion, and politics. Although every thing is expressed decently, and with some caution and moderation, atheism, materialism, and discontent with civil subordination, pervade the whole' 107 - against which a student had marked, in the Author's copy of John Robison's work, 'present situation 2004'. In seeking the precise source of these abominations, we are assisted by Robison's important statement about Freemasonry in Germany - bearing in mind that the pagan Rosicrucianism elaborated (according to Manly P.

Freemasonry was imported back into Germany so mewhat later than into France. The first German Lodge that we have any account of is th at at Cologne, erected in 1716, but very soon suppressed. Before the year 1725, there were many [Lodges], both in Protestant and Catholic Germany. Those of Wetzlar, Frankfort on the Mayne, Brunswick, and Hamburg, are the oldest.... All of them received their instituti on from England and had patents from a Mother Lodge in London. All seem to have got the mystery through the same channel, the banished friends of the Stuart Family. Many of these were Catholics, and entered into the service of Austria and the Catholic Princes' 108 . Robison alludes in this context, to the observed German fascination for 'the gross absurdities of magick, exorcism, witchcraft, fortune-telling, transmutation of metals, and universal medicine', and that Germans in the Lodges 'listened with greedy ears to the nonsense and jargon of fanatics and cheats; and though they every day saw examples of many who had been ruined or rendered ridiculous by their credulity, every new pretender to secrets found numbers [of 'Useful Idiots' - Ed.] ready to listen to him, and to run over the same course' 109 . Enter, once again, the Rosicrucians, followed noch einmal by the Jesuits: 'Freemasonry, professing myster ies, instantly roused all these people, and the Lodges appeared to the adventurers who wanted to profit by the enthusiasm or the avarice of their dupes, the fittest places in the world for the scene of their operations. The Rosycrucians were the first who availed themselves of the opportunity... a set of Alchymists.

Rosycrucian Lodges were soon established and became numerous, because their mysteries were addressed... to the curiosity, the sensuality, and the avarice of men. They became a very formidable band, adopting the constitution of the Jesuits, dividing the Fraternity into circles, each under the management of its own Superior, known to the President, but unknown to the individuals of the Lodges. These Superiors were connected to each other in a way known only to themselv es, and the whole was under one General' 110 . ROSICRUCIANS AND JESUITS WORKING TOGETHER So here we have, from this respected academic source, confirmation of the intertwined machinations of the Rosicrucians and the Jesuits - a combination that raises the question: were certain Jesuits (Weishaupt for inst ance) also Rosicrucians? Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no further need to wonder that both the Jesuits and the Rosicrucians used (and use) the tell- tale label 'The Order', for they were truly rats out of the same sewer. When rats emerge from a sewer, no distinction can be made between them: all are brown. Due to such influences, the 'simple' Lodge s adopted the sorcery and alchemy practiced in the Rosicrucian Lodges, many of which overlapped with the \"'regular' Lodges in Europe: 'and, in like manner, exorcism, or ghost-raising, magic, and other gross superstitions, were often held out in their meetings as attainable mysteries, which would be immense acquisitions to the Fraternity , without any necessity of admitting along with them the religious deliriums of the Rosycrucians' 111 . Concerning Weishaupt's Jesuit background , Robison explained that: 'Of the zealous members of the Lodge Theodore [in Munich ], the most conspicuous was Dr Adam"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"504 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan Weishaupt, Professor of Canon Law in the Univ ersity of Ingolstadt. This person had been educated among the Jesuits; but the [temporary] abolition of their Order had made him change his vows, and from being their p upil, he became their most bitter enemy' 112 , probably because of bottled-up resentment at the oppres siveness of the regime from which he had been released, with its environment of univers al espionage and consequent distrust (very similar, unfortunately, to the environmen t prevalent throughout the colossal US intelligence community, and within British inte lligence, as well).... 'I n his first fervour and high expectations, he [Weishaupt] hinted to several ex-Jesuits the probability of their recovering, under a new name, the in fluence which they formerly po ssessed, and of being again of great service to society, by directin g the education of youth... now emancipated from all civil and religious prejudices' 112 . Detailed information about the collective mentality of The Order of the Illuminati that Weishaupt, by now an implacable enemy of the Jesuits, went on to (re)found - on Jesuitical principles - emerged from the Elector of Bava ria's Court of Enquiry, from depositions given in 1783 by four Jewish Professors from th e Marianen Academy, named Utschneider, Cossandey, Renner, and Grunberger, plus two others. According to John Robison, their testimonies revealed that 'The Order was sai d to abjure Christianity, and to refuse admission into the higher Degrees to all who adhered to any of the three (Christian) confessions. Sensual pleasures were restored to the rank they held in the Epicurean philosophy. Self-murder (suicide) was justified on Stoical principles. In the Lodges, death was declared [to be] an eternal sleep; patriotism and loyalty were called narrow-minded prejudices, and incompatible with universal benevolence; continual declamations were made on liberty and equality as the inalienable rights of man. The baneful influence of accumulated property was declared an insurmountable obstacle to the happiness of any nation. Nothing was so frequently discoursed of as the propriety of employing, for a good purpose, the means which the wicked employed for evil purposes [the end justifies the means]; and it was taught, that the preponderancy of good in the ultimate result consecrated every mean employed [i.e., murder and lying are OK if the outcome is deemed 'good' by the perpetrators - Ed.];... [and] the great object of The Order was held as s uperior to every consideration [viz, all is permitted, in pursuit of the interests of The Order of the Illuminati - Ed.]. They concluded by saying that the method of education made them all spies on each other, and on all around them' 113 . In a later document, written by Weishaup t from 'exile' at Regensburg, he con- firmed that Communism was invented and/or elaborated by The Illuminati, and that rulers who belong to the Illuminati must adhere rigidly to its agenda, without deviation. This is an insight of extreme importance, as it explains why, for instance, President Clinton was not ashamed to write, on White House st ationery on 22nd June 1993, to the World Federalist Association on the occasion of its Global Governance Award honouring its past President, Norman Cousins, that he (Cousins) 'worked for world peace and world government... Best wishes for an enjoyable reception and for future success'. It explains why certain contemporary rulers, such as alle gedly even The Queen, go along with the project for World Government while, in do uble-minded fashion, purporting nonetheless, to represent exclusively the interests of their nations: 'Rulers who are members must be promoted through the ranks of The Order only in proportion as they acknowledge the goodness of its great object, and [its] manner of procedure' (i.e., what lies in store for nation states and their rulers, namely that they are subordinated to the New World Orde r scheme and will in due course"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 505 become redundant). Its object may be said to be the checking of the tyranny of princes, nobles, and priests, and establishing an universal equality of condition and of religion' (a universal tyranny). The pupil was now informed 'that such a religion is contained in The Order, is the perfection of Christianity, and will be imparted to him in due time' 115 . This of course was just another brazen lie. Apart from other considerations, the interests of the state - meaning, of 'the Brotherhood' - are placed permanently above that of the individual; whereas of course True Christianity is exclusively about the reconciliation of the human individual, to a personal God, not to the impersonal, cold-hearted state. Everything the Illuminati propagate and perform represents the reverse of what is good and true - from their devious rationalisations, to the abominations that Illuminised intelligence communities routinely commit in ac cordance with their upside-down principle that 'the end justifies the means'. In parallel with this Luciferian doctrine, Weishaupt also promulgated the evil principle - espoused by US intelligence criminalists, for instance - that anything is permitted and there is only one sin: getting caught. 'All men are subject to errors, and the best man is he who best conceals them' 116 . As a matter of fact, the modern Illuminati recognise just one other 'sin' - stealing money (even if the money stolen has already been stolen previously). What this means is that sorcery, Figure 79: Copy of a letter from Repr esentative Bill Heffner dated 24th March 1997 confirming the establishment of a 'Civilian Inmate Labor Program' and prison camps on US Army installations under the Clinton (Illuminati) Administration.

How ironic that if one steals the root of all evil there is no forgiveness among these criminalists! Jesus Christ teaches that there is only one sin that attracts no forgiveness, ever: blasphemy against the Holy Spirit' 118 . The ex-Jesuit Weishaupt also attached special importance to Bavaria as a central source of anti-Christianity. For he wrote: 'I did not bring Deism into (Catholic) Bavaria more than [exists] in Rome. I found it here, in great vigour, more abounding than in any of the neighbouring Protestant states. I am proud to be known to the world as the f ounder of The Order of Illuminati' 119 . U.S. CONCENTRATION CAMP SYSTEM NAMED THE 'REX PROGRAM' The Degrees, ranks and progress of Illuminati candidates or pupils were organised by Weishaupt and his collaborators in accordance with the system shown in the diagram on page 497 [Figure 78). From this diagram, it w ill be seen that the penultimate Degree, and the first of the two Degrees of the Greater Myster ies of the Illuminati is MAGUS, which this Author believes provides the true meaning of that mysterious 'M' on the late Pope's coffin. The second Greater Mystery Degree, and the last of Weishaupt's system, is that of REX. This is the basis for the use of the codename 'Rex 84' to denote the US GULAG prison camp system, elements of which are listed on pag es 612-613, also referred to as the Civilian Inmate Program - the existence of which was confirmed as early as 24th March 1997 by Representative Bill Hefner, a Jewish member of the US Congress, to his cons tituent, of Jewish extraction, Mr Zell Setzer [ see Figure 79 on page 505]. The US concentration camp system goes by the name of the 'highest 7 'Greater Mysteries' Degree or Rank of The Order of the Illuminati, because when the intended US GULAG is brought fully into operation, the Illuminati plan to commit atrocities and crimes against humanity which will leave history to judge that the Holocaust was a mere prelude to what was to follow - as these criminals, driven exclusively by the 'seething energies of Lucifer', implement the full force of their madness against those refusing to go along with their false prospect us and with their ruthless implementation of the New Underworld Order. The Illuminati cadres driving th is project in the United St ates, occupying the highest positions in the country, are arrogantly certai n of their mission, since they are indoctrinated into the knowledge of the Illuminati's past achievements. For instance, well before the establishment, one after the other, of the two 20th Century regimes of darkness, the USSR and Nazi Germany - both of which we re established by German Illuminists -Illuminati cadres had brought about the unification of Germany throug h the destruction of its smaller states: for Weishaupt asserts \"that the German Union was, to his certain knowledge, the work of the Illuminati' 120 , as was the unification of Italy, preside d over by the sorcerer-Mason Jewish Illuminist criminal drug operative, Giuseppe Mazzini. As to the Illuminati's modus operandi, its secrecy and its Jesuitical manner of operating de facto behind-the-scenes and going underground whenever necessary, or changing labels like underwear, Adam Weishaupt laid down that 'there must (a la Jesuite) not a single purpose ever come to light that is ambiguous, and that may betray our aims against religion and the state'. And in language almost identical to that of the German agent Lenin half a century later, Weishaupt added: 'One must speak sometimes one"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 507 way and sometimes another, but so as never to contradict ourselves, and so that, with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable'. To this overt acknowledgement of how th e Illuminati were to operate, Weishaupt tacked on the principle which is extensively used today in the United States (and increasingly in Britain, also), of testing the 'trance state' of the general population. This is done, for instance, by means of 'limited exposures', which may also serve a diversionary purpose. The principle is contained within the following statement by Weishaupt: 'When our Figure 80: Details of US intelligence operations from a primary US intelligence source. The document, which first appeared in the public domain during 2002, confirms inter a lia that the CIA operative and asset 'Tim Osman' is Osama Bin Laden, and reveals extensive details of other connections which would have astonished the 'mainstream' media if their investig ative journalists had ever conducted the necessary research, instead of specialising in doctored misinformati on. George W. Bush Jr. used to 'manage' the Bin Laden family finances."},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"508 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan strongest things chance to give offence, they mu st be explained as attempts to draw answers which discover to us the sentiments of the person we converse with' 121 . This accounts for the Author's unpleasant experiences over the past three decades, especially in the United States - where serious researchers are liable all too often to be befriended by people who turn out to have an ulterior motive, to be untrustworthy, to be double-minded, and/or to be 'working' for on e of the country's innumerable intelligence agencies. The Author feels understandably violated and abused by these people. 'WE SHALL SET ALL IN MOTION AND IN FLAMES' And in his voluminous correspondence, Weishaupt made it clear that there was intended to be no end to the global machinations of the I lluminati, just as the Jesuits (against whom Weishaupt finally had turned with a vengeance, while all along infecting the Order of the Illuminati's structures with their system of discipline, secrecy and mutual spying) had never ceased scheming with and against potentates and heads of gove rnment everywhere. Referring to his overall revolutionary plan, wh ich he maintained is revealed in part through ritual initiation, Weishaupt boasted that 'by this plan, we shall direct all mankind. In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames. The occupations' (within our Order) 'must be so allo tted and contrived, that we may, in secret, influence all political transactions' 122 . It is this secret association of Black Oper atives, driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer' accessed by demonic programming and led by Dark Actors Playing Games, that is responsible for destabilising the whole worl d - inter alia by seizing control of the mainstream and secondary media, by spreading pornography, drugs and confusion via the Internet, by developing and controlling the global drug trade, by rigging the price of oil, by manufacturing and orchestrating, through innumerable cutouts, cynical provocations such as 9/11, 7/11, the East As ian tsunami and the Pakistan earthquake (via satellite-mounted scalar technology), the Madrid bombings and terrorist atrocities in Bali and India, by the systematic infusion of entertainment and all electronic media with their depravity, by the corruption of education, by indoctrinating all levels of government and using its resources to spread their 'New Age' pagan philosophies and false prospectuses, by further corrupting and perverting the already corrupted churches, by commandeering the sciences to develop more and more 'evil things', by the mixing of medicine and pharmacology with alchemical means of deci mating or controlling targeted elements of the population through such criminal acts as the deliberate contamination of vaccines or 'flu jabs', by means of the criminalisation of the banking system, through the relentless promotion of occultism st arting with the 'in-yo ur-face' display of the Illuminati's actual emblem on the $1.0 bill, by corrupting little children, and by perpetrating such atrocities as the devastation wrought in the New Orleans area as an 'exercise', preparatory to the optional military takeover of each one of the seven Illuminati regions of the United States and the progressive implementation of the intended stra tegy of herding recalc itrant objectors and 'non-cooperators' onto death trains and buses en route for the 'Rex-84' concentration camps or replicated Nazi-style death chambers. It is this secret association of Black Oper atives, driven by the 'seething energies of Lucifer' accessed by demonic programming and led by Dark Actors Playing Games that has been responsible for such Luciferian suggestions as that put forward by the top Illuminist Zbigniew Brzezinski in his book 'The Grand Chessboard' (1997) that a new 'potential' enemy was needed 'since the end of the Cold War', and that the 'immediate'"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 509 task would be 'to develop and simultaneously control a \"direct external threat\" to manufacture an attack \"like a new Pearl Harbor\"' . Earlier, on 3rd July 1979, Brzezinski had revealed that, unknown to both Congress a nd the public, President Carter secretly authorised $500 million to be used for creating an international terrorist movement that would spread Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia to destabilise the Soviet Union -a venture known as 'Operation Cyclone', which fostered the likes of 'Tim Osman' (Osama Bin Laden: see Figure 80, page 507) and eventually cost $4.0 billion. The operation financed inter alia Islamic terrorism training schools in Pakistan. Some of the funds were absorbed by the CIA's very own terrorism training school in Virginia, where Al-Qaeda operatives were trained, with some of the trainees being recruited in the United States. In Pakistan, such operatives were directed by MI6 and SAS. This suggests that British intelligence reports about DVD global terrorism culpability, while accu rate, are also motivated in part by the need to cover up nefarious British involvement. With his Pearl Harbor remark, Brzezins ki was, of course, predicting 9/11. What was required was a credible (at least in the public mind) and well-developed enemy. The need for the same kind of attack (provocation) was mentioned by the notorious 'Project for a New American Century' (PNAC) in its September 2000 report 'Rebuilding America's Defences'. Such an attack would then provi de a pretext for massive sequential military intervention to secure the energy supplies of the Middle East and the lesser (but important) oil-bearing regions, including West Africa, Venezuela, Colombia, certain portions of the Southwest Pacific, and any other region with smaller but more readily accessible reserves. The essential thing would be that terrorists or their \"allies\" must conveniently turn up in each targeted area, on schedule. No problem, argued the US intelligence analyst Michael Ruppert. That's what the CIA, Mossad, MI6, and every other major intelligence agency does for a living'. 'DARK ACTORS' IN THE UNITED STATES, AND SATANIC TRAINING Nor should anyone underestimate the sizeable numbers at the disposal of these Dark Actors Playing Games. According to 'Svali', 'when I left the flluminati' (which she did very courageously in 1995), 'approximately 1% of the US population was either part of the Illuminati, sympathetic to it, or a victim of Mind Control (and therefore considered useable). [Some authorities place this estimated figure as high as 2% - Ed.]. While this may not sound like many, imagine 1% of the population highly trained in the use of armaments, crowd control, psychological and behavioural techniques, armed with weapons and linked to paramilitary groups'. The psychomanipulative training techniques used to manufacture niuminati killers (of whom the Author has met at least two, whose main observable characteristic was their tendency suddenly to switch from a placid disposition to one of extreme, uncontrollable anger), replicated by the CIA's MK-ULTRA (Manufacturing Killers Under Lethal Trigger Requiring Assassination) programme, plumbs the depths of satanic depravity, as 'Svali' explained: 'A SSASSIN T RAINING : H ERE IS HOW IT IS DONE ( HOW IT WAS DONE TO ME ): 1. When the child is two years old, place it in a metal cage with electrodes attached. Shock the child severely. [This model was confirmed to the Au thor by an impeccably informed prior source]. 2. Take the child out, and place a kitten (or rabbit) in its hands. Tell the child to wring the kitten's neck. The child will cry and refuse. 3. Put the child back into the cage, and shock it until it is dazed and cannot scream any more. 4. Take the child out, and tell it again to wring the kitten's neck. This time, the child will shake all over, cry, but will do it, afraid of torture. The child will then go into the corner and"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"510 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan will vomit afterwards, while the adult praises it for \"doing such a good job\". 5. This is just the first step. The animals get bigger over time, as the child gets older. The child will be forced to kill an infant at some point, either a set-up, or virtual reality, or in reality. The child will be taught by the age of nine to put together a gun, to aim, and to fire on a target and on command' (Author: which is what Palestinian children have been taught by their Illuminati trainers to do). They will then practice on realistic 'Mannikins'. They will then practice on animals. They will then practice on \"expe ndables\", or in virtual reality. They will be highly praised if they 'do well', and tortured if they don't comply. 6. The older the child or teen, the more advanced th e training. By age 15, most children will also be forced to do hand-to-hand combat in front of spectators (high people who come to watch the \"games\"...). These matches are rarely done to the de ath, usually until one ch ild goes down. They use every type of weapon imaginable, and learn to fight for their lives. If a child loses a fight, they are heavily punished by their trainer, who loses \"face\" . If they win, they are again praised for being \"strong\" and adept with weapons. By the time they are 21, they are well-trained combat/killing machines with command codes to kill, and they have been tested over and over to prove that they WILL obey on command. This is how children in the German Illuminati are brought up, and I went through it myself. This Author would not have published this information if the precise procedure outlined above had not been independently explained to him by a member of a known US Illuminati family, whose members seem to alternate between people of the highest moral calibre and intelligence, and reprobates whos e lives are obsessed with the evils arising from their family's tradition of Illuminati training or associations. 'Svali's' description of how Illuminati children are trained in Germany is identical to the procedure in question, which is believed to have been applied in the upbringing of the offspring not least of certain prominent and notorious US criminalist intelligence families. All those participants in the Synagogue of Satan who practice the extreme abominations against children* that have been summarised here deserve the most implacable condemnation, and a fate at least equivalent to that specified by Jesus. Christ's anger against such evil people is reiterated three times in the Gospels - a sure indication of the extreme severity of these offences: 'But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea'. Matthew, Chapter 18, verse 4. 'And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and [that] he were cast into the sea'. Mark, Chapter 9, verse 42. 'It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these littl e ones'. Luke, Chapter 17, verse 2. Nor is it surprising that these evil people are unhappy, and discontented with their situation. They are trapped in the hell of th eir own and their peers' invention, and by the loathesome oaths they have sworn, and by fear of the ultimate penalty for 'betraying' them. However they - even these Illuminati - coul d escape, like 'Svali', without fear, if they had the courage to acknowledge the only Name that can rescue them from perdition: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me'. Revelation, Chapter 3, verse 20. * The Author knows of a tragic recent case in which it appears that a carefully planned operation was conducted against a targe t by his estranged wife. Knowing the targeted individual's love for his twin grandsons, the ex-wife appeared for a Thanksgiving holiday, after which the entire family fell seriously ill with some passing infection. A few months later, at a critical time for other reasons, one of the twins fell ill again with a grave sickness, and his vomiting became so bad that he had to be evacuated by helicopter to the nearest specialist hospital. He was falsely diagnosed with a brain tumour, a horrendous operation took place, he died, and the surgeon was heard to exclaim afterwards: 'Wh y have I done this?' The probable answer is that at some earlier stage of his life, he took a Masonic blood oath. The Illuminati may call upon the services of their operatives - such as surgeons - just once in a lifetime. They are then required to 'cooperate'. Should they refuse, their own c hildren will be targeted. The wrong operation was performed on a Masonic handshake."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 511 GERMAN SPOKEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE ILLUMINATI German is spoken at the highest level of the Illuminati, because its Germanic Branch is, as 'Svali' has confirmed, the primus inter pares, overseeing the British Branch, which handles the finances - even though Belg ium is, also according to 'Svali', the actual financial centre. The French-Russian Branch, consisting of the two European Great Powers that have experienced modern satanic revolutions to date is, with the British Branch, subordinate to the German centre, based in Berlin and Frankfurt. There is extreme tension between the German and the British Branches, in particul ar. Throughout this investigation, the central importance of the German dimension of the Illuminati has been conspicuous: the overwhelming importance of the German Branch has simply 'fallen out of this analysis'. And in the German context, the central importance of Jewish/Khazar Illuminati has always been undeniable and self-evident. For at the top, the Jewish (Zionazi) and German Illuminati brainwashed mentalities 'agree', and work together. It s hould surely by now be no surprise that the German-Jewish Nazi Illuminati regime slaughtered millions of Jews, or that the industrialisation of the Nazi slaughterhouse was directed by a Jew called Adolf Eichmann. One of the leading Nazi implementers of the industrialised slaughter of Jews, gypsies and others was SS-Brigadefuhrer Dr Otto Gustav Wachter, the Jewish Nazi Governor of Galicia, Poland. Many other senior Nazis were also of Jewish extraction, as demonstrated in a directory of Jewish implementers of the World Revolution published in the Author's journal Soviet Analyst in December 2005 [Volume 29, #8-10]. The behaviour of the militant Israeli Zionis t minority towards their satrap people, the Palestinians, has been indistinguishable from the behaviour of the Nazis in crucial respects - notwithstanding the extreme provocations to which the Israeli people have been subjected. These things should come as no surp rise because, clearly, if such people are capable of abominations such this Author h as had to allude to (and of many which have been excluded so that we do not waste time in the darkness), why would Jewish Illuminati operatives be distressed at the suffering of their own people? Why indeed are flluminati operatives, from whatever background, indifferent to the suffering they routinely inflict upon others and upon their own members who may appear likely to betray the odious blood oaths they have taken? Because they are possessed with the 'seething energies of Lucifer' - that is, they are 'demon-possessed'. But what gives us certain, lasting comfort and perfect peace, is The Lord's assurance, as he parted from His disciples, that nothi ng that these despicable, depraved maniacs can inflict upon humanity can ever succeed, other than temporarily. Children and innocents, as well as brave opponents of these evils, will suffer and die either because they are innocents or because of their resolute determination to resist these evils by whatever means may be open to them. But the Gates of Hell shall not prevail. For 'Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nati ons, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world'. Matthew, Chapter 28, verses 18-20. And there is nothing that The Order of the Illuminati can do about it. Given that they are all, in secret, profoundly discontented, longing for a way out, it may help any of them who read this treatise to start by pondering the wisdom expressed in Psalm 14, verse 1 [and Psalm 53, verse 11: The fool hath sai d in his heart: There is no God'. ■"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"512 C HAPTER 7: The Synagogue of Satan Chapter 7: THE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN: Notes and references 1.

Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the hous e of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with vi olence... Therefore w ill I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and t hough they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them': Ezekiel, Chapter 8, verses 17-18. Scripture clea rly and repeatedly predicted what the fate of the Jewish people was liable to be, as a consequence of their deviation from the Lord of Hosts. 12. Ezekiel, Chapter 23, verse 15: see main text for explanation. 13. Ezekiel's metaphors using the two originally virginal sisters Aholah (= Samaria) and Aholibah (= Jerusalem) is intended to explain to us, in simple language, how the children of Israel never wholly cleansed themselves from the abominations that they learned while sojourning for over 400 years in the land of darkness, and how, despite the partial cleansing occasioned as a consequence of their embracing the Word of the Lord and His Holy Spirit, they nevertheless allowed themselves to become doubly polluted by the sorc ery that was rife in Babylon - although a remnant saved themselves. Like the entire story of Exodus, this 'real-life' metaphor is spiritual (all Scripture is spiritual) and has pressi ng relevance for us today, not least becau se it provides scriptural confirmation and affirmation of the kabbalistic sorcery perpetuated, as of old, in the dark ch ambers which are replicated today in the form of the Lodge. The passages from Ezekiel using the metaphor of the two wayward sisters are taken from Chapter 23. No te, in verse 4, that the two sisters 'were mine' (the Lord's). We should not be surprised or dismayed at the sexual connotations of this imagery: for sorcery, witchcraft, the Craft (Masonry) an d the abominat ions of the llluminati are sexual, as the Devil uses sex, especially deviant sex, as his fastest means of corrupting a target. 14. For instance, Isaiah, Chapt er 35, verse 10: 'And the rans omed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zi on with songs and everlasting joy... they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away'. 15. The European Union is quintessentiaIly kabbalistic-Talmudic, since within its universe, there is zero truth. Lawyers are confounded by it, as they wrestle with the meaning or implications of any give n Article, subsection, s ubparagraph, protocol or statute, all of which are (a) transitory (because they may be amended, deleted, merged, adjusted or otherwise intermeddled with at any time, given that the 'rolling' colle ctive treaty is updated and rewritten roughly every four years; and (b) susceptible to arbitrarily confusing ruli ngs by the European Court of Justice, which exi sts not to dispense justice, but rather to advance the 'cause' and 'interests' of the political collective. 16. In Revelation, Chapter 2, verse 8 (part), John cited Jesus as saying: These things saith the first and the last (Alpha and Omega = Jesus Christ), 'which was dead, and is alive [rose from the dead]'; [verse 9:] 'I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich)' [Masons 'give' to or are taxed by Freemasonry all their lives, so that their families are deprived of some of the Ma son's resource s; but at the highest levels, the fu nds paid loyally by the lower orders of 'Useful Idiots', who are despised by their superiors, although the lower orders do not know this, ensure that the fat cats at the top enjoy access to a li mitless stream of finance] 'and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan'. 17. The second reference to the Synagogue of Satan is found in Ch rist's instruction to the angel of the church at Philadelphia in Asia Minor - the name of the town where the US Declarat ion of Independence was signed in that Masonic Lodge that can be visited to this day: indeed, when the Author exclaimed within the earshot of the official guide: 'It's a Masonic Lodge', the guide said: 'Oh, so you're a Mason, too!', which was of course quite untrue. The Declaration of Independence sealed the Masonic coup d'etat which set the United States on the path to perdition as the home of criminal governance that it has become today, by way of great riches (which Satan gives to many of hi s disciples as they seek in va in to create heaven upon earth (for themselves)). At Chapter 3, verse 7, it is written: 'And to t he angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith h e that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he th at openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth' ; [verse 8:] 'I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut i t...'; [verse 9:] 'Behold, I will make of them of the Synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I w ill make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know th at I have loved thee'. [And verse 10:] Be cause thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon t he earth'. In the mysterious passage leading into and including verse 10, we appear to have here a partial unveiling of the mystery that is the United States: for, though founded as a geom asonic experiment, and polluted with Masonry at all levels of its official structures, and though its land scape is defiled with such monstrosities as the Masonic Temple at Alexandria and th e vast Masonic edifice in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the United States is also the home of the largest Christian remnant in the developed world (albeit existing within and alongside myriad fals e churches). In verse 9, they of the Synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, will be made to 'come and worshi p before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee', a prophesy that began to be fulfilled when Albert Pike consolidat ed what he purported to be the seat of world Masonry in Charleston in 1870. The prophesy seems to suggest that because those of Philadelphia 'have kept the word of my patience' despite the Masonic coup which Luciferians perpetrated over their heads, the good people of America will be 'kept from trie hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world' to test our faith: and it is manifestly the case that despite the perpetual outpouring of decadent kabbalistic filth and the deliber ate proliferation of drugs by the US llluminati cadres who ha ve hijacked governance, the faith and resolution of many good people in the United States remains unaffected. 18.

Apparently, the truth is that a relatively small clique of Jewish banking families and their non-Jewish allies in the leading families of Europe and America have usurped control of money creation, and with it the destiny of the world. This overclass owns or controls most of the world' s largest corporations, media organisations, intelligence agencies, secret societies, universiti es, politicians, foundations, think tanks and NGOs. It also appears to dominate organised crime. September 11, the War on Terror and Iraq are part of an inexorable process by which this overclass increases its wealth and control. The end goal is a world police state in which the masses will be deprived of their wealth, freed om and possibly their lives. US Neo-Cons are really Neo Communist s. They jeopardise the security of their fellow Jews (as well as all Americans) by their evil machinations. Jews must follow my example and repudiate them. The overclass wants us to see it as a 'Jewish problem'. This way it can divert blame onto innocent Jews and dismiss opposition as 'hatred' and 'racism'. The problem is mainly one of money creation (credit) that has led to an untenable concentration of wealth and power in a fe w hands. Jews are not unique. Almost everyone who is 'successful' in society, Jewish or not, is forced, wittingly or unwittingly to align themselves with the overclass.

Illuminati double-mindedness. ■ DEGREES AND MEMBERS OF THE PRIEURE DE SION The Devil has no new tunes - which means that the myriad Orders of the llluminati have no new ideas, either. These Orders are all organised along the sa me lines, exploiting the standard, always unchanged, lie that discernment knowledge and understanding ca n only be obtained by means of initiation into successive 'Degrees'. Initiation is a device of the Devil, as specifically confirmed by his servant Aleister Crowley: \"This serpent, SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; he bade 'Know Thyself, and taught Initiation'. [Source: Aleister Crowley with Mary Desti and Leila Waddell, Magick. Liber ABA Book 4, Parts l-IV, York Beach, Samuel Weiser, 1997]. The Prieure de Sion is no different. It has two effective groups - The Legion, charged with managing 'the apostolate'; and The Phalange, the so-called 'guardians' of the (fabricated) tradition. A hierarchy of nine Prieure de Sion Degr ees ('grades') is known to exist: • In the 729 Provinces: 1. Novices: 6,561 members 2. Croices: 2,187 members • In the 27 commanderies: 3. Preux:   729    members 4. Ecuyers: 243 members 5. Chevaliers: 81 members 6. Commandeurs: 27 members • In the Arch 'Kyria': 7. Connetables: 9 members 8. Senechaux: 3 members 9. Nautonnier*: 1 member * The supreme office of Nautonnier, or Navigator, is symbolised internally by the boat of Isis. • It will be noticed that the number of members of each grade below the ninth is a multiple of three. There are three times as many Connetables as there ar e Senechaux, three times as many Ecuyers as there"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 7. The Synagogue of Satan APPENDIX 3 TO CHAPTER 7: THE JASON SOCIETY OF THE ORDER OF THE QUEST The JASON Society is among the least known and be st disguised components of the US 'caste' of llluminati. Weishaupt and his associates laid down that the llluminati are never to be referred to by that name, so they hide inside innumerable other 'Orders'. The JASON Society, consisting of 32 members (just as th ere are 32 European Union specified 'crimes' for which Europol was created), also known as the JASON scholars , represent a branch of The Order of the Quest, a senior Order of the llluminati. The na me JASON, which reflects the Georgian story of Jason and the Golden Fleece, is always spelt in capital letters. However the members shroud their Order in secrecy. The group will not reveal its membership list and its members refrain from mentioning JASON membership on career resumes. It is administered by the intelligence organisation known as the Mitre Corporation (MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The JASON group is a mainly scientific organisation formed and hired by the JASON Society to 'invent evil things' (Romans Chapter 1, verse 30), having for instance brought together almost every leading physicist to construct the atomic bomb during the Second World War. The group consists mainly of theoretical physicists and is considered to be the most elite gathering of scientific minds in the United States. The JASON group has always been available to provide the US Government with scientific assistance that it cannot find anywhere else, and its members are probably the only group of scientists some of whose members know the true state of the highest technology, which is proba bly 20 years ahead of information available even in the rarefied components of the public domain. A secret control group operates within the JASON Society called Majestic 12 which in turn is responsible fo r 'US Majestic Intelligence and Security'. Each department and its head are designated MJ-1, MJ-2 et c. MJ-3 is responsible for coordinating all scientific investigations. MJ-5 conducts highly sensitive operatio ns about which no open information is available. MJ-6 conducts applied research in new technology fields, trying out new gadgets. No open information is available on the other departments. Majestic 12 is also known, for security reasons, as Majority 12. • Along with the Open Friendly Secret Society (the Illuminati's name for the Vatican, which is the only nation state that does not belong to the United Nation s) and the Russell Trust, th e allegedly drug-running organisation behind Skull and Bone s, the JASON Society and Group are arguably the best disguised components of the llluminati. Equally well 'hidden' are the Knights of Malta, consisting of parallel European and US organisations with threads weaving through busine ss, banking politics, intelligence communities, organised religion, education, the legal profession, the military sector, foundations, think-tanks, the United States Information Agency, the United Nations and numerous ot her globalist-oriented organisations. The Knights of Malta's world head is elected for life with the Pope's approval. Both the European and US manifestations of this Order are sworn to work toward s the establishment of a New World Order with the Pope as its head. The Vatican is today heavily infiltrated and compromised by Illuminati Orders. Knights of Malta have diplomatic immunity (which is claimed by the parallel US Order as well). This means that Knights can slip across national borders without paying duty or customs charges and can be (and often are) used to carry diplomatic documents and special secret messages to Heads of State. On 27th November 1983, the late Pope retracted all outstanding papal bulls against Freemasonry, allowing Catholics, after several hundred years, again to belong to secret societies without fear of excommunication. • A veteran US intelligence officer named Bob Curran was re ported to be so 'big' in this respect that he has been known to present himself at Buckingham Palace a nd to ask to see The Queen - without an appointment (inside information to the Author). This is the kind of access that a Knight of Malta may enjoy. The Knights of Malta are organised along Jesuitical 'initiation' lines, contrary to the teaching of Christ that no secrecy or special procedures are ever required in order for Him to 'open the door' to us. ■ *lt was significant that George Bush Sr's primary 'gopher', James Baker, appeared in Tbilisi two months after MVD General E duard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet gauleiter of Georgia known locally as 'Stalin II', was 'parachuted' in from Moscow to take over the Georgian Presidency after the legitimately elected President Zviad Gamsakhurdia had been forced to flee for his life follow ing three attempted putsches by Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) forces secretly assisted or 'facilitated' by the Americans. Mr B aker delivered a speech from the balcony of the so-called Presidential Palace, but was forc ed by gunfire in adjacent streets to go i nside and stop speaking for approximately 20 minutes, while Shevardnadze' s brutal forces suppressed some demonstrations. When Baker resumed his speech, it was all abou t the Georgian legend of Jason and the Gol den Fleece. No doubt Masonic members of his audience understood what the former US Secr etary of State was saying. US operatives were closely involved in operations to remove Shevardnadze from his pedestal some 12 years later."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 523 CHAPTER EIGHT THE THOUSAND-YEAR REICH OBITUARY OF GENE RAL REINHARD GEHLEN On 11th June 1979, The Daily Telegraph reporte d that 'General Reinhard Gehlen, West Germany's elusive but legendary spymaster fro m 1946 to 1968, has died aged 77 at his Bavarian mountain resort home. He esta blished what was to become known as the \"Organization Gehlen\" [sic] and later the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst), or Federal News Service, West Germany's intelligence agency [which is] di rectly responsible to the Chancellor. He is credited by many as es tablishing and maintaining the best anti- Russian spy network during the 1939-45 war, following his appointment in 1942 as head of the Foreign Armies East Department'. The article, which was accompanied by a photograph of an extremely unpleasant- looking man in a homburg hat and a description of Gehlen as \"a terrifying figure with boundless energy and professional ambition\", contained the of ficially sanctioned intell- igence which had been cleared for the public domain at the time of publication. According to this source, Gehlen's task wa s to evaluate intelligence reports and to assess the intentions of Soviet forces. But in Ap ril 1945, Hitler sacked him, saying that his analysis of the Eastern Front situation was \"c ompletely idiotic\". Presumably this version of events was obtained from the highly unreliable lips of Gehlen himself, after he had approached the advancing US forces. 'They flew him to Washington where he underwent an extensive period of \"debriefing\". His th eories and prognostications on the Russians persuaded the Americans that, despite his days as a \"bad guy\" serving Hitler, he should now be regarded as a \"good guy\" and help fight the Cold War against the new enemy, Russia. With a budget of around $5 million a year provided by the Americans, he set up a spy network comprised of many former Nazis'. In an indication that the material for this article was written by British intelligence, it continued with typically ersatz 'fill-in colour ', along these lines: 'He liked organising from the background, rarely making appearances in public without his identity being obscured by dark glasses or some other guise. Even his children attended school under assumed names'. Following these statements, the newspaper article elaborated: 'In 1968, he was forced to retire, mainly because two of his ai des were discovered to be Soviet agents'. This particular fact appears to ha ve been expunged from subsequent a ssessments of Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen's career. The British newspaper article concluded: 'But three years later he stepped into the limelight with the publication of his memoirs, \"Der Dienst\" (The Service). In them he claimed that he knew about the Berlin Wall be fore it went up; the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia before it occurred; and to have correctly predicted the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War' 1 . Of course nobody could verify these claims which, in any case,"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"524 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich dealt with past events, so that intelligence connected with them could be safely 'burned'. The US intelligence establishment paid far too much in tention to this veteran Nazi strategist and operative, who leveraged his privileged 'turncoat' position to facilitate the perpetuation and implementation of the German Illuminazis' long-range strategy. In London, Guy Liddell of MI5 warned, to no effect, that allowing Gehl en's intelligence organisation to exist itself risked the likelihood that Gehlen was in fact engaged in reestablishing the nucleus of a revived Abwehr, This is exactly what happened: Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, the 'Black' intelligence organisation b ased in Dachau, referred to in greater detail shortly is part of, or the central locus of, the continuing Gehlen organisation, which is the Nazi Abwehr Continuum. The CIA office in Frankfurt (COREA) is believed to be closely allied with German intelligence generally - in contrast to the CIA elemen ts based in Brussels, which, according to the Author's information, are no t dominated by Germans or their allies and penetration agents, but see much more clearly the extreme dangers faced by both Britain and the United States as a consequence of the cumulative 'successes' of the long-range strategies pursued by N azi 'Black' in telligence. GEHLEN TOLD THE AMERICANS WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR Gehlen fed the gullible Americans with as much disinformation as he could concoct with impunity. For instance, in his self-serving memoirs, he claimed that Hitler's Deputy, Martin Bormann, was really a Soviet agent, who died in the USSR in 1979, even though the 'facts' on which he based these asser tions were thin and were dismissed by the large continuing community of 'Bormann hunters' around the world. As a colleague of Dr Josef Goebbels, who is posthumously no torious for his well- known assertion that Figure 81:The large Dining Room in Hitler's Wolf's Lair, the Fuhrer's headquarters in Berchtesgarten, Bavaria. A Masonic black pentangie, identical to the Red Star, and to the stars on the EU and US flags, is displayed prominently above Hitler's chair at the far end of the room. It is of course the same geomasonic-esoteric star as can be seen used in innumerable contexts in the United States, and on national flags such as those of Iraq, Libya and other countries the elites of which are fully paid-up Illuminati associat es and co-conspirators."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 525 if the public is lied to for long enough, it will co me to believe any lie that is fed to it, Gehlen was no slouch when it came to ma king the intelligence fit inadequate facts. Accordingly, to satisfy his new employers, Gehlen realised that he needed to feed them with information that fitted Washington's preconceived 'take' on international affairs. In the judgment of Victor Marchetti, a former chief CIA analyst on Soviet military capabilities and the author of 'The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence', 'The Agency loved Gehlen because he fed us what we wanted to hear. We used his stuff constantly and we fed it to everybody else: the Pentagon, the White House, the newspapers. They loved it'. And Marchetti elaborated: 'Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of, so we would give him more money to tell us about it. In my opinion, the Gehlen Organisation provided nothing worthwhile for understanding or estimating Soviet military or political capabilities in Eastern Europe or anywhere else' 2 . The final result of these cloak- and-dagger exercises was a reputed Cold War that lasted for almost half a century, and cost American taxpayers alone over $8 trillion. The author Craig Roberts has elaborated: 'Peacetime intelligence-gathering had become big business -profitable not only to the growing intelligence organizations, but to the defense industry and the investors who financed both it and the government' 3 . Actually, the intelligence organisations learned both from their connections with the Sicilian Mafia (heirs of Giuseppe Mazzini' s organised criminal operations) and as a consequence of the mass penetration of US intelligence by German operatives and scientists under the postwar 'Operation Pape rclip', how to exploit opportunities for open-ended criminalist operations under the blanket cover of 'national security', both for the progressive enrichment of the agencies themselves, an d for the purposes of lin- Rgure 82: The North Room of the residence of Theodor e Roosevelt, 26th President of the United States, at Sagamore Hill, Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY.

The scale of Gehlen's decepti on operations against the Am ericans was mind-boggling. Reportedly more than 70% of reports submitte d to Washington on CIA stationery were simply Gehlen's own words. One 'former' CIA op erative is reported to have confirmed that 'Gehlen's reports and analyses were sometim es simply retyped onto CIA stationery and presented to President Truman without further comment 4 . As a consequence, President Truman abandoned attempts to curb the military budget, and expanded spending for weapons research ('inventing evil things'), military equipment, aircraft and the Nazi- directed US space programme. Truman also ordered an expansion of the nuclear weapons production and devel- opment programme, and initiated the process of pumping large sums into the intell- igence community's 'Black' budget to finance covert operations - a tradition which con- tinues to this day, even though the volume of funds maintained and exploited offshore and off-balance sheet by the US intelligence commun ity grows exponentially by the day and has long since ensured that the intelligence commun ity is a 'stand-alone' state within the US state, directing the affairs of every importan t department of the Federal Government, self- selecting its own personnel for the highest o ffices including the Presidency and the Vice Presidency, and self-appointing its own 'handlers' so that its covert appointees do as they are told. Already, over the ten years that followed President Truman's acceptance of Gehlen's lies and distortions at face value, the CIA contrived to consume over $200 million that did not need to be accounted for - equivalent to some $4.0 tr illion in today's debauched US fiat 'funny' money. ABWEHR'S SUCCESSORS PAINTED THE U.S.S.R AS DEADLY MENACE US funding for the Gehlen Organisation only ceas ed as late as 1956. In 2000, United Press International (UPI) revealed that the CIA had finally acknowledged its past relationship with Gehlen, in response to an appeal under a Fr eedom of Information Act request by a US researcher, Carl Oglesby, according to a spokesman for the National Archives. The QA had 'pledged' to release its records on General Gehl en in accordance with the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, setting up the Nazi War Cr iminal Records Interagency Working Group (IWG). It started declassifying documents related to the Second World War in 1998, releasing them through the National Archives. British intelligence sources have informed this author that the Dulles Brothers, like key British intelligence figures, were long-term agen ts of the German (Nazi) Abwehr. No doubt this was indeed so, explaining why Genera l Gehlen encountered no resistance to the fairytales that he was retailing for the benefit of the Americans' 'innocenf ears. In the decade following the Second World War, the Americans had little understanding of the Soviets' military capabilities; so Gehlen painted as bleak a picture as he could of the Red Menace - which was real enough, but of cour se represented a dialectical 'threat', as long intended by the Illuminati manipulators. What actually happened was that the postwar scenario did not develop as they may have planned - a deduction that is consistent with information provided privately to this Author from a high-level US source that President Reagan's intention was to terminate, rather than to 'win', the Cold War, because it had been realised (by the Illuminati) th at it had become both unproductive and counterproductive, especially given the elec tronic 'new technology' advances. 'All that Gehlen needed to do was to paint as bleak a picture of the situa tion as he could, and"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 527 to continue creating reports that indicated that the scenario was continually deteriorat-ing. The more bad news he gave Washington, the more money he would have to work with. He knew that in peacetime, the only way to ju stify a large intelligence organization was to make sure there was always an \"enemy at the gates'\" 5 . HOW GEHLEN EXPLOITED THE EMBEDDED FIFTH COLUMN By way of quite well-known examples of exaggerations, disinformation or outright lies fed by this long-range Nazi Continuum agent to the gullible and eagerly expanding US intelligence community, the following examples are often cited: # Gehen's organisation reported directly to Allen Dulles, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and thus to President Trum an, that the Soviets were poised to attack Western Europe. Specifically, he asserted that Soviet forces in Eastern Europe consisted of 208 crack assault divisions, most of which were high-speed-capable motorised rifle and tank divisions, modelled after the Nazi blitzkrieg pr ecedent. The data accompanying these reports suggested that the Communists outnumbered Western forces by about ten to one. # Early in 1947, Gehlen told the newly es tablished Central Intelligence Agency, which succeeded the OSS and its follow-on Ce ntral Intelligence Group (CIG), that his agents had observed subtle changes in Sovi et billeting and leave policies, with leave cancelled and troops being recalled for so me unexplained reason - from which he purported to deduce that these indications might signal a 'preparation phase' for the suspected blitzkrieg invasion, which was in re ality a figment of his cynical imagination. # Gehlen then predicted that the Soviets would move quickly once all their troops and equipment had been activated a nd made ready for the attack. In reality, as a number of analysts ha ve pointed out, the Red Army in 1946 was grossly over-extended, under-equipped and exhausted, consisting of units that had suffered severe combat degradation. And it had certai nly been the case that many of the Soviet battalions had entered Berlin on foot. The reality was that the Soviets even lacked Figure 83: Diverse working in the m uddy River Plate in Uruguay recovered this heavy bronze Nazi eagle from the wreck of the Second World War German battleship Admiral Gr af Spree.

As late as 1946 , almost 50% of the Red Army's transport was still horse-drawn, as at the beginning the century. Also in the public domain is the fact that US intelligence had itself established that most Soviet forces in Eastern Europe were bogged down consolidating Stalin's conquests, rebuildi ng and establishing repression systems in the Eastern zones, reorganising security structures, and carrying out government administrative functions give n the collapse of governing infrastructures. Indeed, US intelligence assessments had confirmed that Soviet ground and air forces would not be combat-effective against the Western powers for at least a decade. Gehlen and his 'believers' within US inte lligence managed somehow to 'confuse with figures'. A Soviet military division was usually one-third as strong as an American or British division, with far less effective leadership, because instead of being able to function flexibly in combat by taking decisions on the battlefield, So viet officers had to wait for orders from on high before reacting to any change in battle circumstances - a state of affairs which had often caused the Soviets ma ssive losses and defeats in the course of land battles. By contrast, US military doctrine encouraged battlefield decisions during the heat of conflict to be made at the lowest levels. (It may well be the case that some of the atrocities committed by US troops in Iraq may have reflected this doctrine -at least, that is what the officer class has encouraged the jaded outside world to believe). THE BETRAYAL OF 'PROJECT PAPERCLIP' Much has been written about President Truman 's decision in 1946 to authorise 'Project Paperclip', under which the late President Roosevelt's policy of allowing Germany to experience the bitter conseq uences of its excesses, was turned on its head - under the influence of the US State Department in general and th e Germany-educated George Kennan (see below) in particular. No doubt th e information in the public domain on this subject is woefully incomplete. But under the policy, selected German scientists were brought to the Un ited States ostensibly to work on behalf of America in the face of the developing 'Cold War'. President Truman expressly excluded any German scientist or intelligence operative initially 'found to have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazism or militarism'. Accordingly, the US War Department's Jo int Intelligence Objectiv es Agency (JIOA) carried out background investigations of the scientists. In February 1947, the JOIA's Director, Bosquet Wev, submitted the first group of dossiers to the US State and Justice Departments for their review. Samuel Klaus, the State Department's representative on the Board of the JIOA, immediatel y argued that the dossiers we re damning and that all the scientists in the first batch were 'ardent Nazi s'; so their visa 'requests' were denied. Several commentators have pointed out th at Mr Wev was furious. He accordingly wrote a memorandum in which he insisted that 'the best interests of the United States have been subjugated to efforts expended in \"beating a dead Nazi horse\". So far as he was concerned, Nazism was dead - a catastrophic error of judgment that has compromised the United States' future and is well on the way to procuring the destruction of the Republic. As part of his argument, Mr Wev suggested that returning the Nazi scientists concerned to Germany, or leaving them there, would expose them to being exploited by the United States' enemies - a state of affairs which presented a 'far greater security threat to this country than any former Nazi affiliations which they may have had or any Nazi sympathies that they may still have'."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 529 Meanwhile General Gehlen, having formed a close relationship with Allen Dulles, who has recently been exposed by British intelligence as a German Abwehr penetration agent, persuaded the Director of Central Intelligence that it would be in the United States' long- term interests to accept the German scientists. Allen Dulles apparently assured Gehlen that his organisation would survive scrutiny. For his part, Mr Wev evidently prevailed upon Dulles to allow him to have the suspect Nazi scientists' dossiers rewritten, so that incriminating evidence was eliminated. As a consequence of this fraud, over 770 Nazi scientists, initially, entered the United Stat es and were incorporated into the m ilitary-industrial complex, the universities an d the intelligence community. Although a similar Nazi penetration occu rred in the Soviet Union, the United States 'inherited' a large number of Heinrich Himmler's 'Black' scientists who had been engaged in gross, Satanic experimentation operations, including abominations against inmates in Nazi concentration camps. Most an alysts are agreed that the myriad 'Black' umbrella projects later sponsored by th e CIA, including MK-ULTRA, Operation ARTI- CHOKE and Operation MIDNIGHT CLIMAX, were encouraged, if not 'inspired', by this corrosive German Nazi influence inside the CIA's 'Heart of Darkness'. THE EXPOSE OF THE NAZI MOLES BY LINDA HUNT Our knowledge that the Nazi scientists' dossiers had been doctored under the German agent Allen Dulles arises mainly from an expose published in 1985 by Linda Hunt, in the 'Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists', in which she said that she had examined more than 130 reports on 'Project Paperclip' candidate s, and had found that 'every one had been changed to eliminate the security threat classification'. This must surely rank as one of the most extensive mass penetrations of Wester n intelligence and structures in history - surpassed only by the mass penetration effected by 'ex'-KGB and Soviet military Intelligence (GRU) officers under the Clinton Administration, which resulted, according to a source with the Wackenhut Corporation, in more than 17,000 GRU operatives being placed as both 'actives' and 'sleepers' all over the United States. Authorities are also in agreement that President Truman, who had explicitly ordered that no 'serious' Nazis were to be ad mitted into the United States and its structures under 'Operation Paperclip', was never made aw are that his directive had been violated. In other words, the intelligence servants of the President of the United States deceived him - a pattern of behaviour which has become r outine, not least given that Presidents are controlled by intelligence 'handlers'. Memoirs of officials from that era, together with US State Department archive materials, confirm that the President was kept in ignorance. Indeed, officials threw a blanket of secrecy over 'Operation Paperclip' and the issues it raised, specifically in order to ensure that the truth of the matter did not leak into the Oval Office. According to an authoritative wo rk by Clare Lasby on this subject , 'Project Paperclip' officials 'covered their designs with such secrecy that it bedevilled and compromised their own President: at Potsdam he denied their activities and undoubtedly enhanced Russian suspicion and distrust' 6 . In the case of the top Hitler missile scien tist, who had inflicted death and destruction over southern England with his V-l and V-2 ro ckets - which the Author remembers struck horror into us when the engine switched off, a signal that the bomb was about to detonate - a report datelined 18th September 1947 stated that 'Subject is regarded as a potential security threat by the Military Governor'. Bu t in February 1948, a 'revised' security evaluation of Von Braun asserted th at: 'No derogatory information is"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"528 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich available on the subject.... It is the opinion of the Military Governor that he may not constitute a security threat to the United States'. Whether the Military Governor was the same person who had provided the earlier advice is not reported. Even so, the new assessment was still conditional: otherwise the word 'may' would have been 'will'. Further information on the mass infiltration of Nazi scientists and practitioners of abominations into the US structures afte r the Second World War was summarised in Chapter 4. One of the worst cases was that of Kurt Blome, the high-ranking Himmler scientist who had told US military interrogators in 1945 that he had been ordered in 1943 to experiment with plague vaccines on pr isoners in Nazi concentration camps. In 1947, this ogre was tried at Nuremberg on charges of practicing euthanasia disguised as the extermination of sick prisoners 'who were going to die anyway', and conducting unconscionable experiments on humans. Incredibly, he was acquitted, but his earlier admissions were common knowledge and it was generally assumed that he had indeed participated in the gruesome experiments. Two months after he was acquitted at Nuremberg, Blome was being interviewed at Camp David, Maryland, on the subject of biological warfare. He was hired in 1951 by the US Army Chemi cal Corps to work on chemical warfare operations, on the basis of a f ile that contained no mention of his trial at Nuremberg. The fate of another leading Nazi scientist, Major General Walter Schreiber, was also reviewed by Linda Hunt in her article. She reported that the US military tribunal at Nuremberg heard evidence that 'Schreiber had assigned doctors to experiment on con- centration camp prisoners and had made funds available for such experimentation'. The Assistant Prosecutor had stated that the evidence would have resulted in Schreiber's conviction if the Soviets, who held him from 1945 to 1948, had made him available for trial. But Schreiber's 'Operation Paperclip' file made no mention of this evidence. Instead, the Americans found work for him at the Air Force School of Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. When the veteran columnist, Drew Pearson, publicised the relevant Nuremberg evidence in 1952, the resulting negative publicity jolted the JIOA to arrange, according to Ms Hunt, 'a visa and a job for Schreiber in Argentina, where his daughter was living', and on 22nd May 1952, he was flown to Buenos Aires. This departure was just one of a large number of Nazi flights to South America. According to Craig Roberts, while the 770 or more 'Operation Paperclip' Nazi (Himmler) scientists were boldly establishing themselves in the United States, General Reinhard Gehlen, acting with the tacit agreement of the Abwehr agent Allen Dulles, was busily engaged in rebuilding his intelligence connections and networks - inside West Germany. The so-called Gehlen Organisation rapidly re-established control over the majority of his former agents within the Ir on Curtain territories, and, with the help of many members of his former staff, put them back to work. Of course, he double-crossed the Americans, since although he had agreed not to hire any former Gestapo, SS or SD members, this pledge (as he knew perfectly well) was wholly unenforceable. Far from refraining from employing such operatives, he systematically sought them out and placed them on the US-financed payroll, while the already deeply compromised and penetrated CIA did nothing whatsoever to stop this process. His recruits included Dr Franz Six and Emil Augsburg, both of whom had been participants in an SS mobile Death's Head murder squad - the model for subsequent 'death squads' all over the world - which had hunted down and murdered Soviet Jews, intellectuals and partisans wherever they could be found. Dr Six was known as a"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 531 'Streber', or 'Eager Beaver', because of the relentless and ruthless manner in which he pursued his human prey. General Gehlen further recruited the former Gestapo chiefs operating in Paris, and in Kiel, Germany. He also hired the Jewish senior former Gestapo leader in southeastern Europe, Willi Krichbaum. NOTORIOUS NAZI JEWS AND THE HOLOCAUST ('SHOAH') This man was far from the only Jew to function at senior level within the Nazi hierarchy. The most notorious of the Nazi Jews who served Hitler at high level was of course Adolf Eichmann, SS Gruppenfuhrer Heinrich Muller's aide and the head of the notorious Department IVD4 dealing with 'emigration and evacuation' under the Gestapo, who epitomised the previously mentioned aphorism that 'a Jew's greatest enemy is another Jew'. This operative was among the most seni or Jewish Nazis who presided over both a parallel programme to expatriate and/or 'ev acuate' certain Jews (who were primarily Sephardim), and the industrialisation of the N azi killing apparat, which followed the Nazis' pre-existing T4 'euthanasia' programme* unde r which 270,000 members of the general population considered to be 'unfit' to con tinue living were arbitrarily murdered. Among Eichmann's senior subordinates were many other Nazis of Jewish extraction, including a Dr Jacobi, of the General Management, Railway Directorate East, in Berlin, a chief requisitioner of 'special trains' for those destined for the concentration camps and gas chambers, who went under the euphemism 'resettlers'; and the notorious SS-Brigadefuhrer Dr Otto Gustav Wachter, the Nazi Governor-General of Galicia, Poland, who was a key member of special intelligence planning sessions which took place at certain departmental levels in the German Military Transportation Command (Kommandatur) in Akademizca (University) Street, Lemburg [Lvov], where, according to an eye-witness - the Jewish SS Lieutenant General Horst Hoyer - details of the 'final solution' were clearly laid out - by Jews, of whom Wachter was the most senior. Wachter was thus a also a collaborator of SS Gruppenfuhrer Heinrich Miiller, the Jewish Nazi SS General in charge of the Gestapo and the concentration camps who clandestinely reported to his fellow Jew, La vrentii Beria, the head of Stalin's MVD (Interior Ministry). Lavrentii Beria was the deepest German Abwehr penetration at the summit of Soviet power - wielded of course by Stalin, whose real Jewish name was Iosiph Viss-arionovich Djugashvili-Kochba, a descendant, like Beria, of Jews/Khazars from Georgia. The success of the Abwehr (secret intelligence) in penetrating Stalin's closest entourage had only been paralleled in the 20th century by the placement of Grigory Rasputin, the demonic semi-literate fake peasant monk and 'mystic', who exercised extrao rdinary and evil power over Tsar Nicholas and his wife Alexandra, and whose drunkenness, nepotism and sexual excesses, accompanied by accurate rumours that he was a German agent, led to his murder by a group of Russian noblemen in December 1916. * In the recent literature, the Nazis' T4 'euthanasia' programme is mentioned, for instance, on pages 101 and 109 of 'Eichmann: His Life and Crimes', by Professor David Cesarani [William Heinemann, London, 2004], thus: The 'police captain' he [Eichmann] met, and whom he described as 'vulgar' and possibly drunk, was almost certainly Police Commissioner Christian Wirth, who had been transferred from the T4 'euthanasia' programme to [SS Brigadefuhrer Oldilo] Globocnik to design and build a mass murder installation' [page 101]; and: 'In October and November [1941 ] murder experts from the T4 unit were loaned to him [Globocnik, who was SS Police Chief in the Lublin area] and work began on Belzec' [ = Belsen] [page 109]. Concerning the T4 'euthanasia 'pr ogramme which preceded the 'Final Solution' operation, Professor Cesarani, of Royal Holloway College, at the University of London, refers to the gassing t echniques employed to murder thousands of the physically and mentally handicapped in sanatoria and asylums in Germany and the annexed areas in 1939-40.... [ In SS circles at this time, against this background] 'the biological destruction of the Jews was now being seen as a viable alternative or adjunct to deportation' [page 94]. In 2006, the notoriety of the US National Security Agency [NSA] was further aggravated, given controversy surrounding detailed indications of NSA spying not only against foreigners, but also against American citizens, under a vast operation referred to obliquely by intelligence officials simply as The Program'. The a ctual codename for this operation is 'The T2 Program'. The labelling of this operation presupposes the existence of a T1 Program, and arguably of T3 and a T4 (et al ) Programs. Given the clear con- tinuing Nazi orientation, being implemented by the Nazi Fifth Column operating at the highest levels in the US structures, the possibility that these people have replicated the Nazi hierarchy of secret control operations and that a US T4 'euthanasia' Program exists, cannot be excluded."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"532 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich According to Horst Hoyer, exclusively Se phardic Jews (exiles of Jerusalem) were removed from Galicia under Wachter's watch, with whole families being flown out by the German Air Force and aircraft operated by its Axis allies, so that accordingly only Ashkenazim (to which group mo st Jews, as discussed earlie r, were thought to belong) were to be targeted for annihilation. Hoye r's own testimony on the detailed involvement of certain key Jews with preparations for the 'Shock' (incorrectly labelled 'the Holocaust') was presented to the West Ge rman Government in connection with the signing of the German-Israel Peace Treaty in 1952, and subseque ntly to the Institute for Post-War German History. The intelligence source for this in formation was published by Grabert Verlag, of Tubingen, in two revealing articles that appeared in a bulletin for researchers and teachers entitled Hochschullehrerzeitung in 1967 and 1968 7 . The translator of Hoyer's material into English was Henning Fikentscher, also of Jewish extraction. Commenting on this intelligence, Professor (Emeritus) Reuben Clarence Lang, M. Theol., MA, PhD, a Christian German of Jewish background, has revealingly stated: 'One must be mindful of the intense inne r-Jewish tension and contrasts, above all between the objectives of the nationally-assi milated Jews and those of world Jewry and Zionism. These divisions are much, much deeper than the relationships between believing and non- believing Jews. As one becomes aware of this, many other factors, that are otherwise incomprehensible, about Jewry, become clear - the most important in this context being that one group of Jews (A shkenazim) fell victim to another, and that, of those Jews who were targeted, few escaped' 8 . HIDDEN JEWISH ETHNIC CLEANSING AGENDA Seen against this authoritative background, the reality that Nazi Jews such as Adolf Eichmann, Muller, Wachter, Krichbaum, Horst Hoyer and many others of senior rank including certain of Hitler's associates and key operatives - Otto Meissner, Walter Funk, Hans Frank, Alfred Ro senberg, Karl Fiehler, Max Amann, and in the Occupied Territories (Reichskommissar), Wilhelm Fric k (Bohemia and Moravia), Karl Hermann Frank (State Minister, Bohemi a and Moravia), Robert Wagne r (Alsace), Erich Kocherich (a.k.a. Koch) (Bialystock), Friedrich Rainer (working in Carinthia and Carinola) and Gustav Simon (Luxembourg) - together with an estimated 155,000 Jews who served in the Nazi military and repression structures [see Fi gure 85, page 534] mainly to procure protection for themselves and - they hoped - their families) from the industrialised pogrom, becomes distinctly less problematical to contemplate 9 . (Certain other top Nazi police and SS chiefs not mentioned so far, such as Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Erwin Schultz, Panzinger and Walter Schellenberg, are also believed to have had Jewish backgrounds). The realisation that cynically heartless and evil Jews sided with the Luciferian German Nazis to exterminate millions of their own race in what amounted to an inter- Jewish civil war and ethnic cleansing operation directed by Germany's Satanic indus- trialised extermination structures, may be a dimension of the 'mystery of iniquity' 10 that we are not called upon to comprehend. However in view of the ghastly fact that the United States is maturing before our eyes as a monster regime that may make the Hitler era look like a golden age, we will need to factor this paradox firmly into our 'hard disks'.

It would even appear that the primary instigators of the 'Shoah' (Holocaust) were Jews. Others named by SS Lieutenant General Horst Hoyer as having planned the minutiae of the 'final solution' at Lemburg included Jews named Walter Sonnenschein, Zuckerhorn, Spitze, Loewenstein, Gregor and Feckler. Hoyer's memorandum also contained the following observation: 'At the time, those Jews [listed as having attended the meetings at Akademizca Street, Lemburg] feared world Je wry, putting me in th eir confidence, didn't they? They pleaded for my help, knowing full we ll that I was utterly helpless in the face of these underhand activities'. Two weeks after the ratification of the German-Israel Treaty, an official Jewish approach was made to Horst Hoyer offering him a large sum of money (DM30,000) for his memorandum on Jewish complicity in the 'final solution' which he had handed to the West German Government. The proposal contained a demand that Hoyer was to sign a document to the effect that the memorandum was fictitious. He refused, and was murdered some years later.

JEWISH SUPPORT FOR THE ILLUMINATI'S 'BLACK' REGIME In the light of the foregoing information on the participation of a ruthless cadre of Jewish Nazis in the subsequently developed mass extermination machine, it is suspected that collaboration along these Luciferian lines between participating Nazi Jews and the German Nazis may have been a feature of th is Illuminati 'Black' regime all along. And given the fashion in those days for 'racial purity' considerations (eugenics), this Author does not consider it to be out of the question that there may have been a deliberate intention by certain controlling Israelite cadres to 'pur ge' the Ashkenazim in order to 'manage' the intended mass emigration of Jews to the planned State of Israel that had been arranged by Chaim Weizmann with the British. Eichmann, t oo, was extensively involved with operations to transport Jews around Europe and to Palestine.

That the Hitler regime was supported by the Jewish financial power is confirmed by Figure 84 [page 533] which shows that the appointment of H. H. C. Schacht as Governor of the Reichsbank by Hitler on 17th March 1933, as s oon as he had achieved supremacy had to be agreed by the international banking community, whose representative was Max Warburg, the brother of Paul Warburg, the chief architect of the Federal Reserve System, which is 'privately' owned by a majority of European financial institutions As for Wachter, he is believed to have made his way to Italy, where he was thought to have been murdered by partisans - having intended to take advantage of the Vatican's 'rat- run' route by means of which Nazis on the run escaped to Latin America. His family members survived. Gehlen's new employer, the OSS, working with the Vatican, not only encouraged but financed an escape mechanism negotiated and set up by Gehlen for his Nazi colleagues. Although the Vatican has always been 'blamed' for developing the 'rat- lines', for which it provided ample cover in its monastic and church establishments (enabling operatives like Karol Wojtila to enter holy orders, an alternative option), it was in fact the so-called Gehlen Organisation which established, with OSS assistance, the underground escape network which Nazi war criminals could use to escape prosecution by war crimes tribunals.

Within a few years of the arrival of these Na zis in those countries, 'right-wing' 'death squads', modelled on the Nazi SS mobile 'D eaths' Head' (Totenkopf) killing squads that had hunted down and killed Jews, intellectuals and partisans in the Soviet Union and parts of Eastern Europe, made their appearance. Among the Nazi expatriate communities were the notorious 'high' Uluminist Dr Josef Mengele, who collaborated with US intelligence and whose speciality had been to conduct crude experiments on Jewish concentration camp inmates - and the infamous 'Butcher of Lyons', the mass murderer, Klaus Barbie. It is believed that James Jesus Angleton, who worked for the Abwehr agent Allen Dulles and who later in life grew orchids - a plant w ith occult connotations - for pleasure, was primarily responsible for providing escaping Nazis with new identities prior to their leaving the detainment camps.

Unbelievably, this ogre was known to have been living quietly in the spa town of Bad Nauheim, close to Frankfurt, which is essentially, with Berlin and Dachau, a primary German locus of Luciferian Illuminati operations. In 1949, he married another doctor, and they had two sons, settling in Baden-Baden, where he opened a gynaecological clinic. The Austrian authorities belatedly started an investigatio n after having collected witness statements from dozens of Mauthausen inmates, and five years later prosecutors in Baden-Baden issued an arrest warrant for him. He vanished shortly before police appeared at his home. It is believed he was tipped off by the organisation of former SS operatives, Odessa, which specialised in providing wanted SS men with papers and funds with which to escape. His wife remained a doctor practicing in Baden-Ba den, and was known to be still functioning as a doctor there as late as the autumn of 20 05. Heim was believed in 1998 to be living in Spain, but there appear to be traces of him having visited or lived in Egypt (a key Nazi locus, not least because of its occultic connot ations.), Venezuela, Brazil - and the United States 12 . STALIN-STYLE PURGE OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES ET AL For a number of years, the US 'underground ', now dominated by the Internet, has spe- cialised in exposes of the alleged leading American intelligence-political 'crime' families, led by the Clintons and the Bushes. During the Clinton years, observers more or less lost count of the number of intellig ence operatives, military officers, drivers, bodyguards and others who had been 'whacked' - to use the intelligence jargon that seems to be in vogue - in the context of a St alin-style purge of those involved with the nexus of intelligence operations and drug-rela ted scams collectively referred to as Tran- Contra'. The similarity to lif e under Stalin can certainly not have been lost on Russian observers and intelligence officers working out of the Russian Embassy in Washington, who were carefully monitoring the endlessly burgeon ing list of 'Iran-Contra' operatives who were found dead, or who wound up in jail on Stalinesque trumped-up charges. Since 2000, the focus has been on the allege d nefarious serial criminality of members of the Bush family, with many respectable researchers highlighting such facts as that President Bush's grandfather, like Jewish bankers and steelmakers, was instrumental in Hitler's rise to, and consolidation of, power. Rather than revisit such secondary and occasionally questionable or carelessly researched sources for this damning background information, the Author prefer s to rely primarily upon decisive confirmation of all this, published in The Guardian on 25th September 2004, which was based upon 'newly discovered' files in the US National Archives proving that Prescott Bush, the Yale Skull and Bones father of George Bush Sr., was a Director of a firm that was involved with the financial architects of the Illuminati's 'Black' Nazi regime. This had been separately alleged in a number of 'underground' analyses; but now we have the concrete evidence. Today, it is allegedly George Bush Sr. who has been single-handedly directing the Illuminati's push for global control, literally telling Bill and Hillary"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"538 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich Clinton and, reportedly, his son George W. Bu sh Jr., what to do; and the 'white hatted' component of the US intelligence community has been intimidated into impotence, in the face of this clique's powers. The controller today of the secret financial dimensions of the Bush Family's alleged criminalist intelligence operations and affairs is allegedly the family member who is least heard of, Eddie Bush, operating out of Toronto, Canada. The Guardian reported that Prescott Bush's 'business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, have led more than 60 years later to a civil action for dama ges bring brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz.... The evidence has also prompted one former US Nazi war crimes prosecutor to argue that the late Senator's actions should have been grounds for prosecution for giving aid and comfort to the enemy'. 'The new documents, many of which were only declassified last year (2003) show that even after America had entered the war and wh en there was already significant information about the Nazis' plans and polic ies, he worked for and prof ited from companies closely associated with the very German businesses that financed Hitler's rise to power'. For analysts who have not taxed their brai ns to unravel how the Illuminati operate - seeking always to place their agents in hi gh places and manipulating both sides of a given dialectic to their own advantage and in th e furtherance of the agentur's long-range criminal global hegemony strategy - this revelation may have come as a surprise. It illustrates that at the highest Illuminati levels, the false dialectic does not apply. PRESCOTT BUSH AND JEWISH SUPPORT FOR THE NAZIS Specifically, the US banking in stitution of which Prescott Bush was a Director, Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH), acted as a US base for the German Jewish industrialist Fritz Thyssen, who helped finance Hitle r in the 1930s before ostensib ly falling out with him at the end of the decade. Supporting allegations reiterate d in the secondary sources, 'The Guardian's' analysis confirmed evidence that Prescott Bush was also a Director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation (UBC) , which represented Fritz Thyssen's US interests, and that he continue d to work for the bank even after the United States had entered the war. Furthermore, Prescott Bush was on the board of at least one of the corporations that formed part of a complex multinational network of front companies, which enabled Thyssen to move assets around the world. Thyssen owned the largest steel and coal company in Germany, and grew wealthy from Hitler's rearmament programme between the Fi rst and Second World Wars. As one of the primary corporations in Thyssen's intern ational corporate network, UBC worked exclusively for, and was controlled by, a Th yssen-controlled bank in The Netherlands, (which has always been a centra l locus of Nazi Illuminati fundi ng: hence the alleged prominence today in this context of Dutc h banks). Prescott Bush also maintained close links with the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), lo cated obviously in Silesia, which is rich in minerals, on the German-Polish border. During th e war, this company made extensive use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration cam ps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau. Documents declassified in 2004 from the National Archives li nk Prescott Bush to CSSC, although it is not clear whether he and UBC were still involved with the company when Thyssen's American assets were seized by the US authorities in 1942. The National Archives are maintained at the University of Maryland, but some of the documents seen by The Guardian were made available for scrutiny by the Library of Congress. The British newspaper cited three sets of documents:"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 539 1. The Harriman papers at the Library of Congress: These show that Prescott Bush was a Director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen, the Nazi steelmaker, who, as indicated, was of Jewish extraction. 2. The second batch of papers, located in the National Archives, is contained in Vesting Order Number 248, which records the seizure of the company's assets. The files show that on 20th October 1942, the Alien Property Custodian seized the assets of the Union Banking Corporation, of which Prescott Bush was a Director. Having gone through the books of the bank, the authorities made further seizures against two affiliates - starting with the Holland- America Trading Corporation. By November 1942, the Silesian-American Company, another of Mr Prescott Bush's ventures, had also been seized. A Memorandum written by Homer Jones, chief of the Alien Property Corporation's Investigation and Research Division, stated that the stock in UBC is held ... 'solely as nominees for the Bank voor Handel, Rotterdam, Holland, which is owned by one or more of the Thyssen family, nationals of Germany and Hungary. The 4,000 shares hereinbefore set out are therefore beneficially owned and held for the interests of enemy nationals, and are vestable by the APC. Jones recommended that the assets should be liquidated for the benefit of the Government, but in fact UBC was maintained intact and was eventually returned to the US shareholders after the war. 3. The third batch of documents, also located in the US National Archives, was contained in files concerned with the German chemical corporation and notorious manufacturer of Zyklon-B, I. G. Farben. A report issued by the Office of the Alien Property Custodian in 1942 stated, concerni ng the companies, that 'since 1939, these (steel and mining) properties have been in possession of and have been operated by the German Government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country's war effort'. The Union Banking Corporation was specifically established by Averill Harriman, the wealthy son of the railroad magnate E.H. Ha rriman and Prescott Bush's father-in-law, George Herbert Walker ('Bert'), whose daughter Dorothy, Prescott Bush had married in 1921, after emerging from World War I as an artillery captain. Averill Harriman was an Illuminati opportunist who squandered a considerable proportion of his inherited railroad fortune trying to exploit raw materials in Soviet Georgia, only to have his assets there confiscated under Stalin's regime, which handed him worthless paper certificates in exchange. Since 1990, many latter-day Harrimans have followed his example. NAZI MODEL FOR HIDDEN INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SCAMS The model for gigantic, ruthless cross-border raw materials and fina ncial warfare trans- actions with criminalist overtones, which has become the norm at the hidden intelligence and intergovernmental levels today, was thus established in the 1930s, as the following background information reveals. August Th yssen-Bornemisza, Jewish founder of his family's dynasty, had made his money during the First World War, and as a direct consequence of the requirements generated by that conflict. After having contributed extensively to Germany's war efforts, he and his sons Fritz and Heinrich set up a network of overseas banks and corporations so that their assets and funds could be removed offshore, if they were to be threatened by political developments at home. In our own era of money-laundering and drug-trafficking, it is usually forgotten that a primary purpose of offshore accounts is to hide funds from acquisitive, greedy, grasping governments and their penal taxation regimes, which support uncontrolled spending."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"540 C HAPTER 8; The Thousand-Year Reich By the time Fritz Thyssen inherited the business empire in 1926, Germany was in severe renewed economic diffic ulties. After hearing the Illu minati's carefully selected Adolf Shicklgruber (Hitler) speak, Thyssen was duly mesmerised. He joined the Nazi Party in 1931. In his autobiography entitled 'I paid Hitler', he admitted backing the Nazi leader when the National Socialists were still a radical fringe party undergoing IUuminati training. In 1928, Thyssen bought the Barlow Palace, Briennerstrasse, in Munich, which Hitler converted into the Brown House and set up as the National Socialist Party's head- quarters. Funds for this purchase were obta ined from the Jewish Thyssen's Rotterdam- based Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart. By the late 1930s, Brown Brothers Harriman, which claimed to be the world's largest private investment bank, and Union Banking Corporation, had bought and shipped millions of dollars' worth of gold, fuel, steel, coal and US Treasury bonds to Germany, thereby feeding and financing Hitler's war preparations. Between 1931 and 1933, UBC bought more than $8 million worth of gold, of which $3 million was shipped abroad. 'The Guardian' saw documents confirming that after UBC had been set up, it transferred $2.0 million to Brown Brothers Harriman accounts, while between 1924 and 1940 the assets of UBC averaged ar ound $3.0 million, falling occasionally to $1.0 million These data need to be multiplied by, say, 4,000 times to approximate current degr aded fiat currency equivalents. NEW REVELATIONS FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL ARCHIVES Thyssen's partner in United Steel Works was th e Jewish steel magnate Friedrich Flick, who also owned part of IG Farben. Flick's plants in Poland made heavy use of Jewish and other slave labour from the concentration camps in Poland. According to a 'New York Times' article published on 18th March 1934, Friedrich Flick owned two-thirds of the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC) while 'American interests' held the rest. The Guardian' reported that the released US National Archive documents reveal that Brown Brothers Harriman's involvement with CSSC was more than simply holding the shares in the mid- 1930s. A former US Attorney who prosecuted Nazi war criminals in the 1970s, John Loftus, stresses the importance of the cover-up: 'How could it have gone on so successfully for half a century, and does that have implications fo r us today? This was the mechanism by which Hitler was funded to come to power. This wa s the mechanism by [means of] which the Third Reich's military industry was re-armed; this w as the mechanism by which Nazi profits were repatriated back to the American owners; this was the mechanism by which investigations into the financial laundering of the Third Reic h were blunted. The Union Banking Corporation was a holding company for the Nazis, for Fritz Thyssen', Mr Loftus told 'The Guardian', without referencing Thyssen's Jewish back ground - but presumably knowing that he was telling a British newspaper what cannot yet be published in the United States, given US subservience to interests subject to the evil powers exercisable by the criminalist Illuminati 'families'. 'At various times, the Bush family has tried to spin it, saying they were owned by a Dutch bank, and it wasn't until the Nazis took over Holland that they realized that now the Nazis controlled the parent company, which is why Bush supporters claim that when the war was over, they got their money back' - Prescott Bush having reportedly been able to sell his shares for the then gigantic sum of $1.5 million. But the American Treasury's investigations and the intellige nce investigations in Europe completely belie that; it's absolute horseshit. They always knew who the ultimate be neficiaries were'.

As"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 541 a former Federal Prosecutor, I would make a case for Prescott Bush, his father-in-law (George Walker) and Averill Harriman [to be pr osecuted] for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. They remained on the boards of th ese companies knowing that they were of financial benefit to the nation of Germany' 13 . Some intelligence analysts have (as of the first quarter of 2006) moved considerably beyond noting glaring comparisons between the behaviour and mentality of the Nazis and those of the Bush Family and the Bush II Administration. The similarities today are obvious. To begin with, the intellectual and information environment has been deliberately and provocatively contaminated by the US Information Warfare apparat with lies, distortions, diversionary red herrings and deception - through maximising the poten tial of the Internet and the controlled 'mainstream' media to promulgate lies and generate confusion, almost to the point at which all controlled reports and analyses have become counterproductive because the decibel level of deception 'noise' is so great that no-one knows what to believe, clearing the way for lies to become embedded as truth. To this more sophisticated environment of Goebbelsism is perversely added a streak of ruthlessness, a self-evident absence of any mercy, an official environment of arrogant and opinionated self-regard, and abundant evidence of the 'Heart of Darkness' inadvertently revealed by intelligence sources [see page 2], reignited at intervals by further Abu Ghraib- type revelations and images*. In mid-February 2006, the Australian public television station SBS showed more abominable pictures from Abu Ghraib itself, with injured Iraqi prisoners, an apparently dead prisoner, and sexual abuse. These pictures were broadcast less than a week after the release of video footage showing British troops behaving not unlike the barbarian Americans, kicking and beating Iraqis in the southern city of al- Amarah in 2004. A Pentagon official had the temerity to inform 'The Times' (London) that the Australian broadcast threatened to exacerbate an already tense situation, with the usual cover 'line' that 'the release of these images endangers the lives of US soldiers and in the case of Iraq not just American soldiers'. While that statement was obviously accurate, there was of course no hint from the Pentagon that the pictures would not exist if the grotesque abominations had not been officially sanctioned and taught, in the tradition of Himmler, in the first place. At no stage since the barbarism of the Americans, evidently to some extent copied by the feckless British, became notorious around the world, has any indication ever emerged of a determined intention to obliterate such behaviour from the intelligence services and military units involved - for the simple reason that these abuses are indeed taught and officially sanctioned. Intermittent broadcasts and print reproduction of these gross atrocities serve the Illuminati's hidden purpose of sensitising the whole world to brutality - which is exactly the way the German Nazis behaved. 'The Times' reported as follows: 'Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya aired footage, in cluding video of a man repeatedly bang- * On 11th March 2006, The New York Times' led its front page with a report about Ali Shalal Quaissi, who claimed to be the Iraq i in the notorious photograph of US Nazi brutality which became iconically symbolic of the United States' officially-sponsored no-holds-barred arr ogance and barbarism, in which a hooded Abu Ghraib prisoner was shown standing clad in a blanket on a box with his hands attached to elect rical wires. In a follow-up report published in the same newspaper on 18th March 2006, it was ambiguously implied that Quaissi was not the pris oner in question, even though in the same article, the paper reported Mr Quaissi as saying, in tears: 'I know one thing... I wore that blanket, I stood on that box, and I was wired up and electrocuted'. According to Mr Quassi's lawyer, Philadelphia-based Susan Burke, who was representin g Mr Quaissi and other former prisoners in a lawsuit against civilian interrogators and translators at Abu Ghraib, 'the sad fact is that the re is not only one man on the box.... Haj Ali [Mr Quaissi] is but one of many victims of the torture'. 'The New York Times' 11th March article contain ed the following unbelievable paragraph: 'A spokesman for the American military in Iraq declined to comment saying it would violate the Geneva C onventions to disclose the identity of prisoners in any of the Abu Ghraib photographs, just as it would to discuss the reasons behind Mr Quaissi's det ention'. The reader need hardly be reminded that throughout the period 2003-06, the whole world was treated to the spectacle of US legal officials competing wi th one another to elaborate reasons why the United States is not bound by the Geneva Conventions in the context of the so-called global 'War on T error'. Now, all of a sudden, the US military was relying on the Geneva Conventions in order to cover up information of legitimate public interest, not least given the preceding routine official denial that the United States is bound by the Geneva Conventions - a classic example of the double-m indedness of the lluminati and their suckers."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"542 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich ing his head against a wall, photos of a hooded man in his underwear and of a naked figure lying on the floor next to what appeared to be a pool of blood. Other pictures shown on the SBS current affairs programme 'Dateline' included those of a man whose throat had apparently been slit, a group of men being forced to mastur bate in front of bloodied Iraqis who had been shot, and prisoners with burns and weeping wounds'. 'Although just a handful of the images were leaked in 2004, causing perhaps the worst US public relations disaster since the invasion of Iraq, hundreds more were kept secret by the Pentagon'. 'They are now the subjects of a legal battle in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued for their release. And the whole matter is before the courts. A spokesman for Dateline declin ed to say how the programme had obtained the images, but said that SBS was 'confident of the credibility of the source'. A Pentagon official confirmed last night that the images were authentic' 14 . Of course, Baghdadis, who had lived under a Nazi (Ba'ath) regime since 1958, have known all along what kind of occupiers invaded their country. 'Nothing is new to us', Muhammad Shati, 34, a Baghdad telecom engineer, told 'The Times'. 'Those are the Americans we know already. They should stop giving speeches on fighting for freedom: an army of terror cannot defeat terror' 15 . However the Nazi mentality of the US repression machine, disagrees. The United States is accustom ed to the 'death penalt y culture', given the persistence there of a mediaeval tradition of state revenge at the official level, notwithstanding mounting revulsion among ordinary Americans at this revolting practice. On 22nd February 2006, it was reported in the US press that the execution of a prisoner was cancelled after jail officials in California could not find a doctor or nurse willing to administer the lethal injection; and similar reports are not infrequent. A film by Michael Winterbottom, reconstructing scenes of torture and abuse at Guantanamo Bay Cuba - and who has joined others, led by the UK Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs spokesman of the day, William Hague, in calling for the concentration camp there to be closed - shows prisoners being beaten, manacled to floors and subjected to deafening Satanic 'music' in solitary confinement. These are all pr actices that 'Svali ' would recognise. NAZI-STYLE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY U.S. AND BRITISH CADRES The de facto US Nazis were reported in early 20 06 to be paying no attention whatsoever to any criticism of their barbaric behaviour, and actually to be engaged in expansion of the Guantanamo Bay 'facility' so that more pris oners could be housed and abused. However in March 2006, it was abruptly announced, w ithout explanation, that Abu Ghraib - which was, after all, the most notorious of all Saddam Hussein's torture and execution prisons, a tradition that the US 'replacement' Nazis seamlessly perpetuated -was to be closed. A few days later a US intelligence source informed this Author that the Gantanamo Bay 'facility' was also soon to be closed down, but that this hadn't yet been announced. These developments, when considered in the context of certain other setbacks experienced by 'black hats' among the US criminal intellig ence classes, s uggested the possibility of at least a period of consolidation among the Illuminati - along the Leninist lines of 'one step forward, two steps back'. Perhaps there is even a limit to how much bad publicity the thick-skinned intelligence- criminalist thugocracy can handle. For, as we have seen, it is not exactly keen on its acknowledged 'Heart of Darkness' being revealed.

On 16th March 2006, George B. Mickum, a partner with the Washington law firm of Keller and Hackman, who represents Bisher al-Rawi and Jamil al-Banna, two of eight British residents held in Guantanamo, published an extended front-page report in 'The Independent' (London) in which he described th e betrayal of these men by the British Government and their degrading treatment at the hands of the CIA and the US military, which models its barbaric behaviour on German Nazi practice. Mr al-Banna was reported to have said: 'When they came and arrested a nd handcuffed me, they were all wearing black. They even covered their heads black'. The men were taken to the notorious 'Dark Prison' in Kabul, Afghanistan, where they were 'imprisoned underground in isolation and darkness and tortured over [the space of ] two weeks. They were held in leg shackles 24 hours a day. They were starved, beaten, dragged along floors while shackled, and kicked. Round-the- clock screams from fellow prisoners made sleep impossible. Subsequently they were transferred to the US Air Force base in Bagram, Afghanistan. Although they were chained hand and foot and hooded, while waiting to be tr ansported, their captors beat them.... In Bagram, they were imprisoned and tortured for another two months. They were beaten, starved and sleep deprived.... Mr Al-Banna has repeatedly refused offers of freedom, money, and passports in exchange for false testimony. Ultimately, both men', Mr Mickum elaborated, 'were transported to Guantanamo, a trip so harrowing that a government informer, who was posing as a prisoner and had to be transported and treated the same as other prisoners, stated in a television interview that, at the time, he wished someone would shoot him. Forced to wear darkened goggles, face-masks, and earphones, chained at the ankles, handcuffed behind their backs with thin plastic that caused incredible pain, and, in some cases, lasting damage, starving and sick prisone rs who had been deprived of sleep were forced to maintain a sitting position, legs forward and chained without moving for nearly 24 hours.' 'If they moved, they were beaten, kicked , hit with blunt objects....

Congress voted to ban torture by an overwhelming majority in December 2005, but President Bush signed the bill into law with a clarifying \"signing statement\" that allows him to ignore it whenever he chooses.

In response to the Detainee Treatment Act, the US Government moved quickly to dismiss all of the habeas corpus cases filed by prisoners at Guantanamo, including those filed by Mr al-Rawi and Mr el-Banna. Neither man can return to the UK because their visas have expired. The British Government adamantly refused to reissue them visas or allow them to return home on humanitarian grounds.

AN 'IN-YOUR-FACE' ESOTERIC MILITARY SYMBOL ON DISPLAY On 19th March 2006, The New York Times car ried a front-page article entitled 'I N S ECRET U NIT ' S 'B LACK R OOM ', A G RIM P ORTRAIT OF U.S. A BUSE '. The 'Black Room' was a com- ponent of a temporary detentio n site at Camp Nama, the secret headquarters of a shadowy military organisation known as Task Force 6-26 , but which changes its name regularly to enhance its anonymity (starting out as Task Force 121 when formed in the summer of 2003, and now operating under a different designation again).

Placards posted by soldiers at the detention area advised: 'NO BLOOD, NO FOUL'. The slogan, as one Defense official explained, reflected an adage adopted by task Force 6-26: If you don't make them bleed, they can't prosecute for it\". 'The New York Times' article was accompanied by an illustration of the image on the placard [see Figure 87, page 5 45], which showed a black triangle with a white hole in the centre along the lines of which were displayed the words NO/BLOOD/NO FOUL. What the newspaper failed to point out, of course, was that the triangle is the primary occult geomasonic Illuminati symbol, and that the fact that it was solid black except for the 'game hole', signified the Black nature of th e abominations being routinely committed in this Black environment - where Black is universally emphasised, denoting the enduring 'Heart of Darkness' of the US intelligence community and the military. The abominations at Camp Nama 'were' replicated 'at small field outposts, in Baghdad, Falluja, Balad, Ramadi and Kirkuk.... At the outposts, some detainees were stripped naked and had cold water thrown on them to cause the sensation of drowning'. One of Saddam Hussein's bodyguards 'was forced to strip... was punched in the spine until he fainted, put in front of an air-conditioner while cold wa ter was poured on him and kicked in the stomach until he vomited'. The narrative elaborated: 'Army investigators were forced to close their enquiry in June 2005 after they said Task Force members used battlefield pseu donyms that made it impossible [sic] to identify and locate the soldiers involved', as though the abuses were unauthorised from above (an implied lie). 'The unit also asserted that 70 percent of its computer files had been (conv eniently) lost'. The newspaper reported that, imitating the Nazi tactics used by their Nazi Ba'ath pr edecessors, 'in early 2004, an 18-year-old man suspected of selling cars to members of the Za rqawi terrorist network was seized with his entire family at their home in Baghdad. Task Force soldiers beat him repeatedly with a rifle butt and punched him in the head and kidneys'. 'The New York Times' attributed its research to an examination of declassified docu- ments and interviews with more than a dozen military and civilian Defense Department and other US Federal Government personnel, some of whom 'agreed to speak about their experiences and observations out of what they said was anger and disgust over the unit's treatment of detainees and the failure of Task Force commanders to punish misconduct"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 545 In Secret Unit's 'Black Room,' A Grim Portrait of US.

The story of detainee abuse in Iraq is a familiar one. But the fol- lowing account of Task Force 6-26, based on documents and interviews with more than a dozen people, offers the first detailed description of how the military's most highly trained counter-terrorism unit committed serious abuses. It adds to the picture of harsh interrogation practices at American military prisons in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as well as at secret Central Intelligence Agency detention centers around the world. The new account reveals the ex- tent to which the unit members mistreated prisoners months before and, after the photographs of abuse from Abu Ghraib. we re made public in April 2004, and it helps belie the original Pentagon assertions that abuse was confined to a small number of rogue reservists at Abu Ghraib.

It was hardly surprising, therefore, that these young men, once further brutalised by the US military, treat prisoners like the animals they are themselves.

The Muslim Brotherhood was originally an operation of the German Abwehr, its purpose being to destabilise British power and influence in the Middle East. As early as 19209, Al-Husseini instigated a pogrom against indigenous Palestinian Jews. After being convicted in absentia, he was pardoned by the British Mandate Governor, the British Jew, Herbert Samuel. The Governor then proceeded to elevate Al-Husseini as Mufti of Jerusalem, thereby establishing the extraordinary tradition whereby Western leaders prefer extremists over moderates - as, for instance, in the case of the elevation and 'coronation' of the veteran Hamas terrorist Mahmoud Abbas in the context of the Palestinian Authority (the only extenuating circumstance being that Hamas is reliably reported to be controlled by Israeli intelligence - another example of this epidemic of double-mindedness). In 1936, al-Husseini met Adolf Eichmann, one of the Jewish masterminds of the ethnic deansing offensive and shoah against the Ashkenazim Jews. The meeting took place in Palestine, where Eichmann visited for a few days. As a result of this meeting, Al-Husseini was then put on the Nazi payroll, and received Nazi funds which he used, in part, to instigate the Arab Revolt of 1937-39, according to testimony from the Nuremberg and Eichmann trials transcripts. In 1941, Al-Husseini played a key role in instigating a pro-Nazi putsch in Iraq. This was the first of three Nazi Abwenr/Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst-spo nsored coups d'etat in Iraq, designed to procure German access to Iraqi oil and to weaken the British. The business dealings between Donald Rumsfeld, President George Bush's Defense Secretary, originally of German extraction, and George Bush Sr. on the one hand, and their intelligence client Saddam Hussein on the other, proceeded seamlessly in this context - until the parties double-crossed each other, as criminalists always do. Following the collapse of the Nazi coup in 1941, Al-Husseini - one of the most hyperactive Arab intelligence provocateurs in history - helped to instigate the Fahud, or the murder campaign against the indigenous Jews of Iraq, a campaign that has been compared to the kristall-nacht in Hitler's Germany. The Jews of Iraq, very few of whom remain, are of course among the oldest inhabitants of that country, dating at least from the Babylonian captivity of around 590BC. In November 1941, Al-Husseini travelled to Berlin to take operational orders directly from Hitler. During his visit Al-Husseini was treated like a head of state. He then spent the remaining war years in Nazi Germany, where he was officially recognised as the Head of State of a Nazi-Arab government in exile - Hitler having promised him that he woul d be appointed the chief administrator of the Arab world following the Nazi 'liberation'. While in Nazi Germany, this top Arab nazi operative participated directly in in the Holocaust by preventing the exchange of Jews for German PO Ws, thereby ensuring their delivery to the crematoria. Al-Husseini also led the operation to train Bosnian Muslim brigades and other Muslim terrorist groups in Europe, who were involved in mu ltiple atrocities. Al-Husseini distributed monies from the Sonderfund, representing funds looted from Jews en route to the concentration camps, sending funds to the Middle East for use in promoting Nazi and anti-Jewish propaganda. After the war, Al-Husseini escaped to Cairo ahead of indictment at Nuremberg. This Arab Nazi spent the rest of his life agitating against Israel, and died in Beirut in 1974. ■"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"548 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich peremptory note from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Stephen A. Cambone ordering his deputy, the 'fake Christian' Lieutenant General William G. Boykin, to report back to him immediately on allegations of the abuse of detainees at Camp Nama, adjacent to Baghdad International Airport [see Figure 88, page 546] , was of course calculated to imply that senior officials were opposed to these abominations - a 'line' that lacks all conviction, given the pervasive culture of abominable conduct that is not merely condoned, but inculcated into the military, and 'permitted' by the CIA's outsourced 'contractors' tasked with giving new meaning to its self-acknowledged 'Heart of Darkness'. Nevertheless, as 'Svali' informed her debrie fer, the Illuminati and their collaborators are usually (but, as may have become the case by the spring of 2006, not universally) indifferent to exposure of their 'Black behaviour'. She elaborated that the reason for this usual pattern of indifference is their knowledge that the general population will always be reluctant to believe abominations that lie so far beyond their own experience. Certainly, the Author found few signs, during discussions in the United States in March 2006, of any general revulsion at US military and intelligence excesses in this context -given the bombings, atrocities and killings of US personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, for most people interviewed, provided a convenie nt rationale for the appallingly barbaric conduct of their military. A few people seemed uncomfortable when the subject was raised; but the usual response was to change it. Wi tnessed in parallel was something even more sinister: relative US official indifference to the 'public relations disasters' consequent upon the exposure of past atrocities. A similar syndrome was observable in London. This indifference reflects the sinister reality that, as alr eady explained, such exposures actually serve the Illuminati's evil purpose - of desensitising the entire world to abominations, death and destruction, which is their sole enduring speciality, and with which they are permanently preoccupied. After all, those who follow Lucifer are, by definition, bound to the force of death and perdition. Their 'Heart of Darkness' ensures that death is their only product. 'As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pur-sueth it to his own death' [Proverbs, Chapter 11, verse 19] and to the deaths of others. Having learned nothing from history, if they know any, the new generation of Nazis, spiritual and physical children of the 'Operation Paperclip' scientists, intelligence officers and Himmler cronies, are possessed by the same 'seething powers' as their predecessors - but are far more dangerous because of the immense accumulation of physical and (fake) fiat financial power that they control (or think they control) , and because so many of them are personally compromised through blackmail. Because of their own spiritual corruption, they may believe that they have 'no alternative' but to continue with their mad project to consolidate the global hegemony of the self-appointed Illuminati elites whom they serve, and to whom they are allied, and to whom they are often bound by Masonic blood-oaths. So, comparing the Bush II regime's tactics with those of Hitler and documenting connections between Prescott Bush and the Nazis, is nothing like enough to explain why the United States is being transformed into a Fascist police state - even if this process ma y appear briefly, at times, to be halting or on the verge of being postponed or reconsidered. The mystery is deepened by the curious reality that President George W Bush is himself said to be far from enamoured with his father's German-oriented manipulative behaviour. However talk of a split between the senior Bu sche and his son cannot be confirmed, and may represent disinformation, given repeated indications of German (DVD, Dachau) influence at the highest levels in Washington - the appointment of General Mike Heyden, who reports to John Negroponte, who allegedly reports to Bush Sr., being a case in point."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 549 SOVIET JEWISH COMMUNIST-F ASCISTS SERVING UNCLE SAMUEL To help them impose the Fascist model, the US proto-Nazis notoriously invited two 'for-mer' KGB Generals, Oleg Kalugin (the poisoned um brella expert, of Jewish extraction) and Alexander Karpov, former KGB Rezident at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, to join the consultancy payroll of the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. They were subsequently joined by KGB General Yevgeniy Primakov (Finkelstein), the former head of Russian external intelligence, Gorbachev-era Prime Minister, Supreme Soviet official and top intelligence and Middle East expert, who publicly rejoiced at this opportunity to come aboard the US 'gravy train'. Specifically, the Author's intelligence publication Soviet Analyst 16 reported in April 2003 that 'the appointment of Yevgeniy Primakov as a 'consultanf to the US Department of Homeland Security' was among the most alarming developments to have been monitored since President Bush Jr. came to office. 'The former KGB chief, who of course allegedly has blood on his hands 'in spades', will, am ong other things, provide the United States with the benefit of his unparalleled population control experience in connection with the development of a State Secu rity (SS) Citizen Threat File, recently set up under the auspices of the US Department of Transportation (because the Transportation Department's budget was raided to finance the purchase of the computer hardware and software that was needed)'. 'Data processed through this equipment will be disseminated to a division entitled the Office of Internal Security - established by and serving the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Department of Homeland Security, and several other agencies. This agency, under the previously disgraced, since rehabilitated and dubiously-pedigreed Admira l Poindexter, is coordinating a colossal operation to establish 'Citizen Threat Files' on every citizen of the United States. The resulting database will incorpor ate credit files, me dical files, political and religious affil- iations, military histories, attendance at anti-Government rallies, and other dimensions of human existence. When questioned about what personal information the US authorities would actually be liable to access, the Depart ment of Homeland Security replied that it would defeat the purpose of the programme if it were to reveal what kind of information would be sough?. 'Assisting General Primakov in the installation of this US version of the Soviet-style repressive control apparat will be General Aleksandr Karpov, the former KGB station chief (that is, Rezident) in Washington. The two Soviets, who of course continue serving the covert Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will draw substantial remuneration for their 'services'. In a recent interview, Primakov said amid cynical laughter that he couldn't wait to join the 'Pay Corps', and that a large number of 'former' KGB Generals and Colonels were lining up to join the rush to be signed up for their Ameri can official pay checks. After all, Khrushchev Jr. works for the Washington-based Heritage Foundation'. 'General Primakov, who personally spearh eaded arrangements for the implementation of the GRU's global terrorism 'work' using ignorant and brainwashed Islamic radicals, was voluble when asked what all this was supposed to be about. The establishment of the State Security Citizen Threat File was just one of many steps being prepared by the US Government to tighten security in view of the te rrorism threat - of which he failed to remind his interviewer that he was one of the chief Soviet architects.

'Primakov thought that was very funny, and laughed. He elaborated that he also found it highly amusing that 'all these righ t-wing flag-wavers' who were so anti-Com- munist, were now supporting a state policy involving the introduction of 'internal passports' (his words). Yes, he reiterated that the State Security Citizen Threat File and NICA were among measures being developed in order to sensitise the US population to new kinds of documentation and to the carrying of identity cards, pursuant to America introducing the Soviet policy, as he put it, of 'internal passports'. Meanwhile the former KGB Chief, who remain s a top Soviet strategist, continues to assist the GRU in prosecuti ng the Party's revolutionary global terrorism sub-strategy' 16 . His knowledge of what is going on in the United States is sufficiently well-honed for him to have understood that Fox News seems like a propaganda organ of the Bush Administration. In an interview in July 2004, Primakov joked: 'We had [sic] Pravda. Your Republicans have Fox News'. In June 2004, Primakov stated in a separate interview that the Bush II Administration was engaged in 'the Sovietisation of America and that when the full provisions of Patriot Act II became law, the auth orities would be 'allowed' to establish an American GULAG'. As indicated in Appendix 1 on pages 612-613 the structures for the US GULAG have been in place for some years. The language of Patriot Act II said to be almost identical to that of the 1965 Soviet Internal Security Enhancement Act. PRIMAKOV AND FRIENDS JOIN UP WITH GENERAL RICHARD SECORD In yet another interview conducted (in early 2006), KGB General Primakov - whose code-name means that he is the primus inter pares - noted that he, Karpov and Kalugin, had joined the former East German secret police (STASI) chief, General Marcus Wolf, also of Jewish extraction, to run a newly established corp oration based in downtown Sophia, Bulgaria. Sources say that the new entity's title appr oximates Trans-Global Security Consulting Group Limited, and that General Richard Secord, likewise of Jewish extraction, is on the firm's board. Marcus Wolf had further been co -opted as a consultant to the Department of Homeland Security where, according to misinformed or deliberate ly obfuscating British intelligence sources, he was supposedly being 'deb riefed'. Wolf's speciality, while in charge of key components of the East German repres sion apparat, was to convert an estimated one- third of the population into spies - against each other, their families, and everyone else. The objective of the Sophia-based organisation, Primakov told an intelligence-con- nected interviewer, is to provide ongoing tr aining for the heads of the vast new political organisation, linked to and spawned by close a ssociates of George Bush Sr., to be known as the Neighbourhood Watch Associati on network. Training will al so be provided to assist the development of the new Civilian Defense Force (CDF) when fully funded. In the fam iliar tradition of Leninist 'candour', General Kalugin, who knows what he is talking about, is on record as having said that the intention is to form a new Gestapo in the United States. As will be reviewed again later, the STASI was and still is used as long-range cover by the successor 'Black' intelligence agency to the Abwehr, a.k.a., the Gehlen Organisation, a.k.a.

The organisation he had put together on instructions evidently issued by Republican Party cadres has received funding from the American Freedom Association, which must not be confused with a legiti mate organisation of the same name. The Foundation was said to be providing an initial $5.0 million annually to finance this 'free- standing' embryonic domestic spying network. The objective is to establish a 'private' Gestapo in the hands of the globalist criminalist Illuminati cadres who have long since seized control in the United States, but whose d ecisive grip on permanent power is not yet (as of 2006) 'irrevocably' cemented into place. Th e spy network is to be 'privatised' in order to separate it from any question of official control, and from any restrictions, in terms of what kinds of people are employed to man this sinister 'fifth column' network, such as gangsters and operatives from the criminal unde rworld with which the organisers are very familiar.

What ever the outcome, the models for all this frenetic secret activity are the Illu minati's Nazi and Communist formulae. The choice of Bulgaria as the location fo r the 'Trans-Global Security Consulting Group Limited' was suspicious. Bulgaria is a sm all, poor, and totally corrupt country and, since the 1980s, has been the primary external seat of Russian, Turkish and other organised criminal enterprises, of which Bulgaria's own KINTEX is a notorious example. The country is an important transit link between 'Heroin Number 4' exports from Afghanistan to Europe - greatly boosted as a direct consequence of the American invasion, which resulted in heroin production soaring from a 'negligible' 100 tonnes under the Taliban in 2001, to over 4,500 tonnes in 2004, in conform ity with the Illuminati's greed for drug- related 'pipeline' funding - to Europe and th e United States . Deals are usually arranged between the Turkish Mafia intermediaries and Italian Mafia traders, who buy heroin from the Turks and ship it to Europe. They also make extensive use of the Polish port of Gdansk, assisted by Italian Mafia operatives resident in Poland 17 . For any Soviet-US 'security consulting' group to be located in Sophia theref ore smells of further intelligence preparations for the proliferation of New Underworld Order corruption, even suggesting that the real purpose of the intended Neighbourhood Watch Association arrangements is actually to provide cover for unimpeded dr ug-trafficking, and pre-emptive precautionary structures against any official operations designed to disrupt this burgeoning criminalist activity. For make no mistake: the hegemony of the Illuminati, which is still not inevitable and which, in any case, will fail, after wreaking historically unprecedented death, chaos and destruction, presupposes the unhindered prim acy of open-ended criminalism in every corner of governmental and 'free-standing' components of society. Why else was the corrupt British 'New Labour' Government engaged, in 2006, in establishing gambling houses in British provincial cities, if the intention was not to provide a bridge into Britain for US organised criminal gangs and further outlets for drug- and organised crime-related money-laundering? The point here is that the new US Reich is built and motivated by corruption, which m eans that the structures that its progenitors develop will corrupt themselves, as happened in Nazi Germany. REPUBLICAN PARTY CONNECTIONS WITH THE NAZIS In the 1930s, the US Republican Party paid for Nazi broadcasts and employed German Nazis to assist with the formulation of election campaigns. Herbert Hoover, of German extraction, reportedly conspired with top Nazi officials in Berlin to unseat President Roosevelt in the General Election held in 1940. When George Bush Sr. was Chairman of the Republican National Committee, he set up ethnic heritage groups within the Party as havens for former Nazis. He also em ployed known Nazi criminals on his campaign staff. Moreover, in the United States, as in Germany, Nazism has crucial Jewish connections, beyond the Jewish background of prominen t figures on the political st age today. One of the most important Jewish influences on the US Nazis a nd so-called 'neo-cons' (who are almost all Jewish, and whose philosophy is akin to Trotskyism in many respects) was a certain German Jewish Fascist posing as a 'refugee', Leo Strauss. The Zionist mentality and the Nazi-Fascist mentality are identical, being pr ogeny of the same genes; and there has always been a close and sinister association between Zionism and the Nazis, as is implicit in the preceding Chapter. The Zionists actually a ttempted to limit the choices available for European Jews to two: emigrate to Palestine (under the provisions wrung by"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 553 Chaim Weizmann and his colleagues from the Br itish Mandate) or perish in the (intended) Holocaust. This reality 'illuminates' does it not, the suppressed collabor ation between senior Nazi Illuminati Jews and the German ethnic Illuminati Nazis over the industrialised mass murder 'ethnic cleansing' abomination. This collaboration was much more extensive than has yet been reported, with new glimpses of what was going on surfacing from time to time. For instance, in 1951, a Jewish doctor then employed in the Tel Aviv municipal hospital, was accused by several witnesses of brutal acts comm itted at Vlanow camp, where he had acted as 'assistant to the German camp commandant'. A female witness said he had beaten her unconscious, and when she had recovered, she had found her three sons, aged 12, 15 and 18, shot dead. Two weeks earlier, she said, she had seen the accused order the Ukrainian camp police to remove 30 prisoners, including her husband, who were then shot. On 8th May 1948, the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported that 'the verdict in the trial of 23 guards at the Breendouck concentration camp in Antwerp, one of the lesser-known Nazi hells, was announced here yesterday. Among the guards are three Jews, Walter Obler, Leo Schmandt and Sally Lewin. Obler and Lewin have been sentenced to death and Schmandt to 15 years' imprisonment'. Many such reports are believed by researchers to have been 'censored' by intelligence or Jewish-linked ce lls attached to press rooms. As a student, Leo Strauss studied Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Schmitt, the philosophers who provided the basis for Fascism - a concept developed by one of the Two Karls' (see page 558), Professor Karl Keller, of Frankfurt University. As his studies progressed, Strauss's views became increasingly Fascist, focusing his thinking on the necessity of totalitarian government. He rejected all principles of international law and believed in maintaining the masses ignorant and in general servitude - which is being Figure 90: Two Rosicrucian symbols that employ the 's pread-eagle' symbol adopted by the Nazis. As Figure 91 on page 555 shows, this symbol is borrowed from the ancient Egyptians. Egypt was and is the Biblical metaphor for 'Darkness', an 'honour' which it shares with Ba-BeAon, where Baalim (demon-gods) were worshipped. Other Rosicrucian occult symbols include a large number of Masonic images, notably one beneath which is inscribed the words: R OSICRUCIAN I LLUMINATI .

Leo Strauss was one of the most important Nazi agents of influence to have pen- etrated the US structures, having left Nazi Germany in 1934 with the warm commendation of the Nazi jurist and philosopher, Carl Schmitt, who was personally responsible for arranging, in 1934, a Rockefeller Foundation sch olarship for Strauss. This enabled him to leave Germany, to study first in France and th en in Britain. Strauss arrived in the United States from England in 1937. After a brief spell as a research fellow in the Department of History at Columbia University, he then became a member of the graduate faculty at the New School for Social Research in 1938, whic h he infected with some of his weird and sick Illuminazi ideas. ILLUMINAZI IMPERATIVE TO CO NTROL THE 'MAINSTREAM' MEDIA The New School of Social Research was founde d in 1919, a year after Willard Straight, the father of Michael Straight, who was associated with the 'Cambridge Five' (see page 560) had died during the post-First World War influenza pandemic. Straight Sr., who had been a partner of J. P. Morgan, thought that the Un ited States' security depended upon the British fleet, and that it was in the United States' best interests to enter the First World War. Naturally, he also saw the war as a brilliant opportunity for US bankers and industrialists, as always, to make substantial gains inter alia at Britain's expense. In 1915, Straight Sr. had left the Morgan empire for a position within the American Inte rnational Corporation, which was affiliated with National City Bank. A year earlier, Straight had founded and funded the 'New Republic', a left-wing current affairs magazine which his son Michael was to edit years later. J. P. Morgan became obsessed with the media dur ing the First World War - emulating Lenin's parallel obsession with publishi ng, newspapers, film and thea tre as propaganda vehicles - and willingly helped to finance the journal, for three interesting reasons which typify the thinking of the 'Illuminati'. First, the journal would keep him informed of the thinking in left-wing circles, given the assumed i mminent ascendancy of Communism , which he seemed to know all about: he even financed an agent inside the US Communist press. Secondly, Morgan believed that a journal such as Straight's 'New Republic' would allow the Left (component of the Left-Right dialectic) to blow off steam, thereby providing a safety valve. Thirdly, his calculation was that sponsorhip of the journal would give him the power of veto over any plans originated from the Left. Illurninist J. P. Morgan's sponsorhip and control of the 'New Republic'- an operation remarkably similar to the British Rothschilds' interest in 'The Economist', the Fabian journal, complete with its red masthead, which sells its elf as an objective journal of international affairs - was only one of the steps he took to procure control over the media. In 1915, he brought 12 newspapermen together (12 newspapermen + J. P. Morgan = a Council of 13) and commissioned them to determine how the US national press could be brought under control; and his panel decreed that all that was necessary was to achieve control over 25 of the most influential papers. Morgan's imme diate response was to send agents to BUY the editorial policies of the 25 selected and targeted newspapers. Morgan also used his deep pockets to finance the American Legion and to craft it into a trade union-busting and agitprop organization of hired thugs who ran amok"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 555 during the 'Red Scare' of 1919, terrifying and murdering countless trade union leaders and leftists. Of course, these details of the United States' early Nazi/Fascist 'brownshirt' history have been conveniently 'forgotten' and are never mentioned in 'polite society'. It is usually asserted that the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is an offshoot of, or 'controlled by' (or both) the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), Britain's premier globalist think-tank. This is a remarkably long-lived piece of disinformation. In reality it began as yet another Morgan (Illum inati) front group, aimed at influencing the American population. It emerged specifically during the First World War from the Rhodes Roundtable Group. Most of the earliest members were Morgan employees who had met their British counterparts during the Paris P eace Conference. The CFR was meant to be a bridge between the Morgans and the Rockefellers, with the Rockefellers providing much of the necessary finance. As the Rockefellers' fortune began to outgrow that of the Morgans, the Council on Foreign Relations came to be more dominated by the Rockefellers. The links between the Morgan and Rockefeller dynasties were further promoted by the Yale Skull and Bones 'patriarch' Percy Rockefeller, one of the darkest US Illuminati grandees of his age, who served on the Board of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Meanwhile Leo Strauss remained at the Morgan-connected New School of Social Research for ten years. In 1948, he accepted a position at the University of Chicago, founded by the Rockefellers, which became the source of the theory of 'monetarism', a mechanism for the 'control' of the expanding fiat money supply. Significantly, this 'economic philosophy' did not 'take off' until after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, which gave rise to the uncontrolled expansi on of the US dollar money supply. It first gained a foothold in the United Kingdom, not least as a consequence of detailed coverage published in successive issues of 'Internationa l Currency Review', and became the dominant theme of Mrs Thatcher's Governments. In the United States, monetarism was preached by Milton Friedman, and his teachings fell on decidedly receptive Federal Reserve Board ears, given the need for an intellectual 'discipline' to govern and control the expansion of the fiat money supply both domestically and internationally. In the event, the expansion of fiat money has been hidden from general public view because it has ta ken place primarily in the intergovernmental sector, the banking system, and with the use of offshore corporations, banks and accounts - which is where the New Underworld Order of the Illuminati has achieved its most profound impact and where it has sown the seeds of its own destruction. Figure 91: The Winged Globe of Egypt. This symbol, which appears over the pylons or gates of many ancient Egyptian palaces and temples, is emblematic of the three persons of the Egyptian Trinity. It can thus be seen from Figures 89 and 90 that (a) Nazism is the dialectically opp osite 'wing' of Communism and (b) it was/is an illuminati operation deriving its occultic symbology via Rosicrucianism from Egypt (= The Darkness') . Hence, the Rosicrucians launched the 'New World' Order, Communism and Nazism as mechanisms for the prosecution of their global hegemony objectives.

The Rockefellers' Fascist credentials are extraordinary. For instance, the Rockefelle r-owned Standard Oil Company did business with the Nazis during the Second World War; while it was the Rockefeller Foundation that provided the funding for much of the Nazi regime's research into eugenics, including funding for the occultic research into twins conducted in the concentration camps by Dr Mengele and his co lleagues. The German Himmlerian scientists' fascination with the minds of twins is among the most sinister of the Nazis' Luciferian preoccupations, which has long been transferred to the United States. Leo Strauss's legacy within the ideological intelligence and 'neo-con' communities in the United States is extensive. For quite simp ly, Leo Strauss passed on his fervent Fascist totalitarianism to a generation of figures who duly achieved positions of influence and power, and whose Nazi mentality is in the as cendant. Many 'neo-cons' serving in the Bush II Administration or in the American Enterprise Or ganization, which funded the notorious Project for the New American Century (PNAC) which promoted unilateral military intervention in defiance of international law a nd public opinion, were students and followers of Leo Strauss. It was during Strauss's tenure at the University of Chicago that David Rockefeller and David Ashcroft received degrees from the University of Chicago. THE CHICAGO SCHOOL AND AN ECONOMIC POLICY OF RUIN The Rockefeller family not only funded Strauss but have been instrumental in helping to destroy Third World economies. Several resp ected analysts have concluded that the Rockefellers have used the Un iversity of Chicago and their various family foundations to promote what, in the Third World context, has often led to an economic policy of ruin. The laissez-faire economics promoted by the Chicago School has failed numerous times in the past, and was one of the leading causes of the 1929 stock market crash and the resulting Great Depression. Such economic polic ies only lead to global Fascism and corporate rule, considered objectives of the Rockefeller and other Illuminati families. One of the most successful operations spons ored by the Rockefellers and their allies fostering a latent Fascist mindset in the Unite d States and Britain, has been their effective control over economic thinking. During the 1 920s, the German-speaking Jewish academics Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. Hayek, who became well-known economists, rose to prominence assisted by Rockefeller funding. Von Mises toured the United States in 1926, thanks to sponsorship by the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Foundation, and successfully promoted the views of the Austrian (to become the Nazi) School of Economics. Von Hayek personally tutored David Rockefeller in econom ics, and in 1950, Von Hayek was brought to the United States to teach at the University of Chicago, as Professor on the Committee of Social Thought. One intelligence report states: 'This was an exceptionally dangerous position for a man that held the views Hayek held'. In 1945, Hayek's poorly written book 'The Road to Serfdom' openly attacked the concept of the nation state. Lo and behold, this 'right-wing' tutor was teaching the same doctrine as Lenin - a fact that s hould come as no surprise to us, given that Leninism and Fascism are simply two dialectical FALSE 'opposites' manipulated and controlled (behind the curtain like the Wizard of Oz) by the Illuminati -just as the so-called right-wing capitalist bankers J. P. Morgan and the Rothschilds financed left-wing publications. Von Hayek argued that the nation state was a hindrance to peace, while socialism presupposed totalitarianism; so he proposed a"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 557 form of totalitarianism to take the place of the nation state, namely a supranational authority or World Federation consisting exclusively of the (corrupt) financial elite. In case the governing structures of the ex isting nation states and even of the insti- tutionally corrupt European Union Collective should fail to advance such a prospect with sufficiently decisive momentum, the 'financial elite' have long since resolved to drive towards this outcome on their own initiative - which explains why so many shadowy new financial networks and structures are springing up and being developed, that have only tenuous relationships with the nation states within which they are being established. These networks, which dispose of and ha ndle flows-of-funds that dwarf the Gross National Products of many nation states, cons ider themselves to be 'stateless'. They are 'needed', inter alia, to distribute the vast and ever-accumulating flows of secret funds that are being generated by the drug-trafficking sector and as a consequence of clever untaxed exploitation of the Babylonian fiat money banking system. As this hidden process proliferates, centres of financial strength are developing within the framework of existing political structures which command buying and financial distribution powers placing them effectively in a higher echelon than the nation states in which they operate. THE MALEVOLENT MINDSET OF FRIEDRICH VON HAYEK In 1947, Friedrich Von Hayek created the Mont Pelerin Society, consisting of members the European financial elite, as a first step towards the realisation of the supranational authority he had written about in his book 'The Road to Serfdom'. This 'wholesale' organisation has, over the succeeding years, created numerous 'retail' 'conservative' think-tanks that promote free-market, laissez-fa ire policies on behalf of the Establishment (i.e., in the shadows, the Illuminati). Among such 'retail' think-tanks it has spawned have been the Heritage Foundation (1973), wh ich behaves like a m outhpiece for CIA policies, the Fraser Institute (1974), the Manhattan Institute (1977) and the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research (1978). It is very likely that the London-based Centre for Policy Studies, founded by the late Sir Keith Joseph, Mrs Thatcher's in-house guru, and direct ed for a time by Sir Alfred Sherman, a former Communist, has a similar origin. Since 1969, most of the Nobel Prizes for Economics have been awarded to promoters of laissez-faire economics - despite its spectacular Third World failures, and its bu ilt-in tendency to expand the loan portfolios of the Illuminati-friendly banks. The connection between the Un iversity of Chicago and Fascism was vividly illustrated in Chile, when the 'boys from Chicago', di sciples of Milton Friedman, destroyed the economy and reduced Chileans to near-serfdom under President Pinochet's version of the Nazi utopia - where dissent was eliminated by 'death squads'. It is not yet clear, but soon may be, how far away from such a Fascist ou tcome Britain and America were when this book was being finalised in 2006: but that both countries had moved far down the same road was becoming evident to a widening public as both Governments floundered amid the chaos they created, to begin with, in the former Nazi state of Iraq. Friedrich Von Hayek's prescription requires corporations to assu me effectively the status of sovereign nations, while the underlying nation states are reduced to the standing of quislings of the corporate state and enforcers of the laws that they require. Many powerful US 'Trotskyite' 'neo-cons' linked to the official structures are cloned with the mindset of Von Hayek, due to the fact that they beli eve in Mandeville. Never heard of him? Von Hayek rejected the truth that Man is created in the image of God 18 , and traced his philosophical ancestry to the early 18th century Satanist, Bernard Mandeville."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"558 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich THE DIALECTICAL WORK OF GERMANY'S 'TWO KARLS' Two 'rival' but instrumental 'philosophies' were developed by the Illuminati controllers in the 19th century, to assist with the acceleration of their mad plans. At the very same time that Karl Marx (Moses Mordecai Levi) was writing the 'Communist Manifesto' under the direction of one group of Illuminists, the Jewi sh Professor Dr Karl Ritter of Frankfurt University was developing the Antithesis unde r instructions from another cadre of the Illuminati - so that those directing the long-range strategy at the highest levels could, in accordance with the perverse logic intended, exploit the differences between these two opposing 'mechanistic forces' to divide larger and larger components of the human race into opposing camps so that they could be armed and then enticed to destroy each other, along with their political and religious institutions. The evil work started by Professor Karl Ritter was continued by the nihilist German Illuminati Magus and philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900), and by Heidegger, and Schmitt, and was elaborated into Fascism en route to National Socialism, thus providing the controlling elite with the desired 'Black Regime' tools for the fomentation of the First and Second World Wars. Figure 89 on page 551 shows definitively that Nazism and Communism are two gross manifestations of the same Luciferian 'Black' abomination. The early Nazi Labour Day emblem shows a youthful Karl Marx, a hamme r and sickle, and a bird with its wings outstretched perched on an orb inside which is engraved a Nazi swastika. Figure 90 on page 553 illustrates two Rosicrucian symbols that employ the 'spread-eagle' symbol used by the Nazis; and Figure 91 on page 555 reveals the original source of the 'Winged Globe of Egypt', displaying the actual derivation of these occult symbols: they are taken from 'The Darkness'. It was out of 'The Darkne ss (symbolised by ancient Egypt, where the civilisation was in thrall to the cult of death) that the children of Israel were led towards 'the land of milk and honey' - symbol for the light of the true God, away from and the opposite to, the darkness of Lucifer. According to Professor Rev. Sir Henry Chadwick 19 , the 'milk and honey' metaphor would have been easily understo od by the Israelites, since it was used in contemporary pagan mystery rites. The 'Exodus' from 'The Darkness' towards the 'land of milk and honey' is a living, real-time historical metaphor for the work of God in leading each of us towards the Truth, if we so wish. Between 1859 and 1871, the Americ an Satanist and Magus, Albe rt Pike, who was certainly 'possessed' and was able, as we have seen, to summon up evil spirits, elaborated a 'Blueprint for Global Revolution' involving three massive, successive upheavals or rev- olutions, which he thought would catapult the Illu minist conspiracy to its final stage during the 20th century. In the event, everything of course went badly wrong - with the possibly unintended Cold War stand-off, for instance , seriously undermining the timetable of his maddened successors; so a catastrophe was launche d at the beginning of the 21st century in order to reignite and re-kick-start the World Revolution and to restore it so that it would conform more closely to the Blueprint. The 9/11 attacks were designed to set the agenda for the whole of the 21st century; and given the purported Islamic connection, clearly represent a Luciferian determination by the conspirators to genera te the conditions for Pike's 'third conflagration'. Most of Albert Pike's evil planning work was conducted in a 13-room mansion that he had built in Little Rock, Arkan sas, which 'just happens' to have been the seat of the Clintons before Bill Clinton was elevated (by the Illuminati, of which he is a key member) to the US Presidency. Little Rock is also the home town of the Rose Law Firm, which is allegedly a continuing hyperactive servant of the secretive US Illuminati structures."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 559 THE THREE CALAMITIES PLANNED BY ALBERT PIKE As the episode involving Sister Ingersoll (see page 286) makes clear, General Albert Pike was certainly 'possessed' - a condition brought about by the scale of the slaughter over which he presided during the American Civil War, and by his repeated indulgence in occult seances and the summoning up of evil spirits at Masonic events. Pike concentrated his evil brain on developing practical pl ans for replicating the slaughter he had generated and witnessed during the Civil War, on the world stage. Experts believe that Pike was actually communicating with evil spirits when he deve loped these plans; but this Author would go further, suggesting that he was reflecting the intentions of Satan himself. According to his Blueprint, the third and so-called 'decisive' Luciferian conflict was to be fomented by deploying the 'actives' and agentur of the Illuminati to pit the Jews against radicalised Islam, so that these two opposing forces would destroy themselves. Alt hough Pike appears not to have been of Jewish extraction, Giuseppe Mazzini, his partner in global criminality, certainly was: so here we have another extraordinary piece of evidence that a small minority of controlling Jews seem to have ' no problem' when it comes to plans for the partial destruction of me mbers of their own race*. Today, we can see clearly that much of the residue of Pike's first two calamities, which certainly 'changed' the world beyond recognition, have ostensibly been dismantled - and the dark forces and 'Dark Actors Playing Games' associated with them duly redeployed in preparation for Albert Pike's third, and 'final', intended global cataclysm, through the manipulation and leveraging of the differences between Zi onist Jews and that parallel Luciferian invention, Islam. This e xplains the deliberate exploitation and further mobilisation of Islamic 'terror' and the artificially and instrumentally fomented tensions that are plaguing the world today. Within and behind this framework, the Nazi International intelligence strategists based at Dachau comp ete or collaborate to leverage their long experience of mobilising the Islamic fanaticism th ey have evoked, in the interests of long- range Pan-German hegemony strategy, whic h complements that of the Khazarian Illuminati and may for all practical purposes be at times merged with it. On 15rd August 1871, Albert Pike inform ed his revolutionary colleague Giuseppe Mazzini that after the Third World War of glob al upheaval has ended, those who aspire to undisputed world domination will provoke the gr eatest social cataclysm that the world has ever known. The letter in which this demonic curse is spelled out is held in the British Museum library, and reads, in part, as follows: 'We shall unleash the Nihilists and Atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the true effect of absolute atheism, origin of slavery an d the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilisation, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity (the True manifestation of which cannot be destroyed), wh ose deistic spirits will be from that moment without compass, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light *Most Jews would be horrified to know this, and rightly so: but the evidence of th is destructive Levitical/ Pharisaical/radical Rabbinical mentality is well documen ted, albeit kept under wraps. It was most abhorrently summed up by Maurice Samuel in the following ghastly 21 words: \"We Jews, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers forever... Nothing that the Gentiles do will m eet our needs and demands' ['Maurice Samuel: 'You Gentiles', 1924, cited by Douglas Reed, 'The Contro versy of Zion', Veritas Publishing Company Ltd., Western Australia, page 107]. Although this statement directs vituperative hatred towards non-Jews, minds and souls that contain such hatred cannot be relied upon not to vent it upon their own people, as well: which is unfortunately what a significant number of Jewish Nazis did during the barbaric Third Reich period."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"560 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out into public view, a manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and terminated at the same time'. (Note this clear, perverse affirmation that Luciferians are not atheists - Ed.). A direct link between Lenin and Albert Pi ke, which proves the Illuminist-Masonic origins of Soviet Communism (evident enough from the multiple Masonic symbolism visible in and around the Kremlin) can now be presented. A passage in Lenin's 'Collected Works', which were of course compiled and publi shed before the First World War, reads as follows: 'The World War (i.e., as it turned out, of 1914-1918 - Ed.) will see the establishment of Communism in Russia; a Second World War will extend its control over Europe; and a Third World War will be necessary to make it worldwide'. The central phase of Lenin's forecast was almost fulfilled by the outcome of the Second World War, after the secretly revolutionary American controllers had deliberately permitted the revolutionary Soviets, originally funded by Khazarian Wall Street m oney, to extend the frontiers of Communism to the middle of Europe. With the removal of the Berlin Wall and the iron Curtain, and subsequent events, the Leninist strategists took 'one step forward, two steps back', to clear the way for preparations for the third intended conflagration envisaged by both Pike and Lenin - two rats out of the same sack. One of most encouraging features of the bl eak picture painted hitherto is that the flluminati are reliably reported - inter alia by 'Svali' - to be unhappy with their situation. Buried within that finding is the reality that, notwithstanding the brainwashing and Satanic abuse that so many Illuminati cadres have suffered in the past, the mind manip- ulators appear, on the basis of anecdotal evidence, to have been unable to obliterate the consciences of their victims, however dulled they may be. The Author has had personal, direct experience of one such victim, whose 'MK-ULTRA' personality had been deliberately split so many ways, that one had to be permanently on guard that his 'handler' would not 'trigger' a violent reaction on demand, or that a given word or phrase might have the same consequence. This deeply damaged criminal in telligence operative clearly retained a vivid sense of right and wrong, even though, when triggered or drugged, he would always show signs of intending to pursue the aiminal, evil course 20 . In the same way, the offspring of Illuminati figures often come to understand, at least in part, the error of their parents' ways - and are even, as in the case of Michael Straight, the son of Willard, able to attain a degree of belatedly valuable discernment, MICHAEL STRAIGHT AND THE CAMBRIDGE 'APOSTLES' Writing in his autobiography 'After Long Silence' 21 , Michael Straight reported that in the autumn of 1936, he was introduced to a secret society calling itself the Cambridge Conversazione Society, whose members were known as The Apostles. Straight reported 22 that this secret society - like Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key et al at Yale (and similar secret societies designed to corrupt youth at other US universities) - had been founded in the nineteenth century. 'Its members included most of the University's great men'. The source of this information (about German flluminati pe netration at Cambridge) was an undergraduate contemporary of Straight's called David Champernowne. 'I asked if I might be told the names of some of the members of the society. David pledged me to secrecy, then told me that Keynes was its most influential member. Denis Robertson was a member; so were Sir John Sheppard, the Provost of Kings; G. M. Trevelyan, the histo-"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 561 rian; the novelist. E. M. Forster; and the philosopher. G. E. Moore. Some of my friends were members, David added: Victor Rothschild, for example, and Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt'. Burgess and Blunt were of course members of the notorious 'Cambridge Five' ring of moles, hitherto always assumed to have been agents for the Soviets. But as will now be revealed, they had 'other roles', as well - just as, in the later historical context, the STASI has provided deep cover for Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD). Michael Straight then revealed that to join 'The Apostles', candidates had to take the equivalent of a blood oath. In Britain's more refined society, the pagan ritual initiation rites associated with Skull and B ones appear either not to have been de rigeur, to have fallen out of use, or never to have been instituted; alternatively, Michael Straight has not revealed the full extent of the necessary occult pagan rites for initiation into The Apostles. But he did confirm that members were bound by a ghastly oath: 'We met in Keynes' rooms. I held up my right hand and repeated a fearful oath, praying that my soul would writhe in unendurable pain for the rest of eternity if I so much as breathed a word about the Society to anyone who was not a member. It seemed a bit harsh, but Sheppard' [WHO WAS PROVOST OF KINGS, REMEMBER - THUS REPLICATING THE PARALLEL DIRECT AND CORRUPT INVOLVEMENT OF THE GOVERNORS OF YALE COLLEGE IN SKULL AND BONES] who carried a cushion with him wherever he went [sic!], patted me with his free hand and told me not to be alarmed. \"You see\", he explained, \"our oath was written at a time when it was thought to be most unlikely that a member of the society woul d speak to anyone who was not Apostolic'\". 'I asked Sheppard how he would define the term Apostolic. He beamed at me in his childish way, \"One must be very brilliant and extremely nice!\" he said' 23 . Straight's subsequent prose leaves no doubt that the reader is expected to understand the homosexual overtones prevalent in this milieu - not least given that the occult ceremony took place in the rooms of John Maynard Keynes, a notorious homosexual. So, IN CAMBRIDGE AS AT YALE, a secret society, es tablished in the 19th century, had been engaged for generations in corrupting young men and binding them together for lifetimes of worldly, self-interested communion, on the basis of ghastly, occult oaths (and in the United States, at least, a prolonged series of abominable pagan rituals). Such oath-taking is forbidden by Jesus Christ in explicit terms: 'Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths; But I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne; Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil 24 . Michael Straight elaborated that 'one of th e Apostles who came back to Cambridge for our meetings was Guy Burgess.... As an unde rgraduate, Guy had been a member of the Communist cell in Trinity. I did not know that. He had broken with his Communist associates in 1934 in a manner that some of his friends found bizarre. That was also unknown to me. I knew only that he lived in London [and] that he was working for Captain Jack Macnamara, a Right-Wing Member of Parliament who had close ties to the Nazis. In a sidelong phrase, Guy would joke about the homos exual encounters he had taken part in with Macnamara and his Nazi friends. In a moment of elated intoxication, he would hint that he had learned something of importance through the indiscretion of a Nazi diplomat'."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"562 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich 'There was a suggestion that Guy was up to something; but what? He was close to the Rothschilds; were they supporting him? Jews were deeply concerned about the developing ties between Hitler's agents and th e Conservative Party. So were others. For those ties were of immense potential significance. If the Conservatives were resolute in resisting German expansion, p eace might be prolonged. But if a Conservative Government established secret ties to Hitler...'. The Anglo-German Link, established by.. . Admiral Sir Barry Domville, was too dis- reputable to sponsor an alliance that was in the making. The Anglo-German Fellowship, in contrast, was led by powerful men. The Prince of Wales was known to favor closer ties with Germany. The Cliveden Set sh ared his views, and it included the hard core of the Conservative Party. Its aims were never discussed in public, but the opposition of students like myself to rearmament stemmed in part from an intuitive sense that the Government was rearming not to resist Hitler's armies but to di vert them to the East.... What was Guy really up to? No-one asked him. Most of us were intere sted in politics; he had to wedge his way to the center of the political stage. Some of us were ambitious; he had to obtain power to satisfy his fantasies. He dreamed of using power for his own, capricious ends'. 'In his guise as Captain Macnamara's secretar y, Guy pointed to Fascism as the wave of the future. He voiced no such opinions in the meetings of The Apostles. In any discussion of ideas, he was always ready with an apt quotation, an amusing anecdote, a suggestive analogy, a mocking riposte. If the question before the society was political, he spoke in metaphors that were distant and obscure. If he was challenged to state his own convictions, his bright blue eyes would widen. He would look at the challenger with a beguiling smile, and then speak of other things' 25 . Burgess et al were Nazis. 'CAMBRIDGE FIVE' EXPOSED AS ABWEHR AGENTS In the autumn of 2005, the Author was informed by a British intelligence contact that elements of MI5 had reached the conclusion that Burgess, Maclean, Blunt and other British traitors, hitherto always believed to have worked for the Soviet Union, were in fact long-term agents of the German Abwehr who had found themselves 'stranded' following Hitler's de facto repudiation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. According to this interpretation, the British traitors Burgess and Maclean were thrown as a consequence upon the 'mercies' if Lavrentii Beria, Stalin's MVD secret police chief, who has been exposed by British intelligence as a long-term Abwehr mole working at the highest level of the Soviet Government. Beria s ought supreme power immediately following the mysterious death of Stalin, but was arrested at Khrushchev's instigation during a risky operation in June 1953. According to a report from the US Embassy in Moscow, on the afternoon of 27th June 1953, 12 armoured personnel carriers, 36 motorcycles, twenty T34 tanks, 23 SU 100 self-propelled guns and 12 maintenance vehicles could be seen moving along Bol'shaia Sadovaia Street' 26 . The reason for this deployment was that Khrushchev and 'the coup plotters, improvising as they went along, were in considerable danger for the ne xt few days, until the Beria forces could be subdued, and any potential challenges resisted. Although they tried to keep the arrest top secret, word was doubtlessly getting around and they could not be sure what the repercussions would be'. Khrushchev could not rely on colleagues in the Praesidium and effectively 'bounced' it into going along with the move against Beria, who may have been shot in June. Accounts of his death vary and have never been clarified, and neither have analysts yet focused upon Beria's long association with the Abwehr - hints of which emerged when the Praesidium of the Soviet"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 563 Council of Ministers was shown a document on 2nd June 1953, drafted and signed by Lavrentii Beria, entitled 'Measure s to Improve the Political Situation in the GDR' which made the following recommendations to the East German Communist leaders: '(1) Abandon the policy of forced construction of Socialism; (2) Work for the creation of a united, democratic, peace-loving and independent Germany; (3) Stop forcing the creation of agricultural cooperatives, which have met with great resistance from the peasants; (4) End the policy of eliminating private capital, which is premature, and draw private capital into key areas of the East German economy, including the agricultural sector; (5) Introduce broad steps to improve the financial system ; and (6) Take broad measures to ensure individual citizens' rights and put an end to unjust and cruel judicial treatment; review those already in prison' 27 . Implementation of this document would have represented a radical dismantling of overt Communism and therefore a threat to the power structure in the Soviet Union itself, as well as throughout Eastern Europe. In other words, Beria attempted to implement the strategy finally unveiled more than a generation later under the cold eye of Beria's fellow Illuminati Khazarian, Mikhail Gorbachev, believed to have remained in charge of Soviet global intelligence strategy as late as 2005. Given the Abwehr's penetration of Stalin's structures at the highest level, it would have been extraordinary if similar penetrations ha d not occurred within the supreme structures of other Great Powers, es pecially the United States and Britain. In the United States, the Abwehr secured the services of innumerable agents, from the Dulles Brothers and corrupt intelligence officers to the Nazi scientists brought to the United States under 'Operation Paperclip' and in subsequent years. But German influence and penetration of US structures should realistically be traced back at least to the foundation of Skull and Bones at Yale in the early 1830s; while any definitive analysis of it would have to include the activities of the Bush Family and of the academic penetrations by Von Mises, Von Hayek and Leo Strauss, already mentioned. It would also need to take account of the previously mentioned indications that Dr Henry Kissinger, despite his known Soviet codename BOR, is alleged to be a primary US handler for Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, Dachau, as well as occupying a high occult Illuminati status - not least as the 'mentor' of George Bush Sr., and the official who 'per- suaded' (ordered?) President Ford (Leslie Lynch King Jr.) to remove William Colby as Director of Central Intelligence, and to re place him with George Bush Sr., affirmed by intelligence sources to be nothing less than the head of DVD. This and other sensational findings were reportedly established when a team of operatives attended the Munich Beer Festival in October 2005, aided by a satellite positioned overhead. Their real purpose was to identify visitors and personnel entering and leaving the nearby DVD headquarters. GERMAN PENETRATION AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN BRITAIN In mid-October 2005, 'International Currency Review' exposed the late Sir Edward Heath, the British Prime Minister who died on 17th July 2005, as having been a long-term Abwehr agent. The expose revealed that 'within a matter of days of Heath's death on 17th July 2005 at the age of 89, the Editor of this service received two separate confirmations, both from British intelligence sources, that Edward Heath was a long-term agent of German (Nazi) intelligence. In fact Edward Heath betrayed hi s country for 60 years - the longest penetration in history. To remain undiscovered for 60 years is an achievement without parallel in the sordid history of geopolitical intelligence'.

Roy ('Woy') Jenkins (subsequently, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead) later became the Chancellor of the Excheque r in Wilson's Labour Government and thereafter the President of the European Commission (EC) , while Geoffrey Rippon was the co-signatory together with Edward Heath of the United Kingdom's Treaty of Accession to the European Communities in January 1972, which led to Britain becoming a member of the EEC on 1st January 1973. Notwithstanding this, in February 1972, the Second Reading of the EEC legislation in the House of Commons was approved by a majority of only eight, 'in an atmosphere that degenerated into fisticuffs'. 'Arnold Toynbee's recruitments became the most successful German intelligence penetration operation ever directed at the United Kingdom, with three members of the Oxford Ring playing central roles in forcing Britain, predominantly against its will, into the German-sponsored European po litical and economic collective', which, as is partially reviewed on pages 567 et seq., is a hotbed of corruption. 'Both Edward Heath and Geoffrey Rippon received secret payments in exchange for their signatures on the accession document, setting th e scene for subsequent corrupt payments for similar services rendered by some of their successors. For the odious intergovernmental system of secret, intelligence-managed 'Black Op erations' geopolitical 'facility fees' or special corrupt payments, was already well established at the beginning of the 1970s'. According to (he Author's ongoing researches, it has become the norm. 'Edward Heath was a German (Nazi) agent who became Prime Minister of Great Britain. As soon as he was unexpectedly voted into power in 1970, he immediately set about to fulfil his secret instructions to bamboozle the British people and the House of Commons (which he did by perpetrating a number of gross lies that have since been exposed) into pleading for and accepting membership of the secretly German-sponsored political collective. And the initiators and director s of this project were the superior brains at the Madrid-based Nazi International, a.k.a. the German Geopolitical Centre, reviewed below' [see pages 573 et seq.]. 'The Author remembers actually standing inside Downing Street, as it was possible to do in those days, and watching the newly elected Prime Minister entering Number 10 in triumph on the day of his election, 18th June 1970, after securing a narrow victory over the Labour Party led by Harold Wilson, having started at a clear disadvantage in the opinion polls. The so-called 'Conservatives' won office with an overall majority of 30 seats'. 'Heath first entered the Westminster Parliament with a tiny majority of 133 votes in the then marginal seat of Bexley, which he held until he belatedly retired from the House of Commons in 2001. According to the obituary published on 18th July 2005 in 'The Daily Telegraph', 'in his maiden speech 29 , he attacked the then Labour Government for its very negative response to the Schuman Plan to cr eate a single European market in coal and steel'. When Harold Macmillan became Prime Minister some 13 years earlier in 1957, he celebrated his victory with Edward Heath over a dinner of oysters and champagne at the Turf Club; and in 1960, Macmillan brought Heath into the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal, responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom's first application to join the European Economic Communities.

'The DVD is so secret that its finances ar e hidden (that is, it is financed by 'Black Operations' resources) and there appear to be no traces at all of this service being funded by the German taxpayer, precisely becau se it is funded clandestinely'. 'And what will cause very great astonishment outside intelligence services around the world is the location where the DVD is based: DACHAU, the town that gave its name to the notorious concentration and Holocaust extermination camp'. 'While ostensibly visiting the Salzburg (music) Festival in 2003, Sir Edward Heath travelled to Munich and Dachau, where he was alerted by the DVD that his life-long service to Germany's covert Nazi intelligence community had been uncovered by British investigators. A UK intelligence source reports that he literally blew a fuse when this warning was delivered - which is to say, he suffered a pulmonary embolism'. 'Plans to interrogate Heath were blocked at Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) level and by Number 10 Downing Street '. One of the Author's special friends commented: 'No surprises there' - given that MI6 is headed by an operative allegedly considered to be an asset of French and German intelligence'. It has since been established that this also, in mid- 2006, applied to the head of MI5. Like most of his post-war predecessors, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was alleged to have been compromised on several levels. 'The super-secret covert Black Nazi DVD acts with the approval of the German Government, and 'owns' the German Chancellorship, beginning with the postwar Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was an asset of the German Abwehr before its collapse. It follows that the German Government is, at an y point in time, actually the instrument of the secret Nazi International Establishment, the main blueprint of which was intercepted by the Allies in the early 1950s'. (It is also a fact that the 'overt' or 'White' German foreign intelligence service, Deutsche Bundesnachrichten Dienst, reports directly to the German Chancellor, as well). This has all been covered up as a consequence of the extensive penetration of the CIA and, indirectly through the French c onnection, of MI6, in later years'. The Author's International Currency Review report elaborated: 'When the members of the Nazi Oxford Ring were recruited, the Master of Balliol College, Oxford (Lindsay) entertained certain nagging suspicions. It is understood that he was initially tipped off by the College's Head Porter; at al l events, the Master reported the members of the Ring to MI5, which 'then' maintained a recruiter (for British intelligence) based at Oxford University, and had become well aware of increased German intelligence activity in the Oxford area during the months prior to the Munich Conference, from which the Prime Minister, Mr Joseph Chamberlain, returned from his fatal meeting with Herr Hitler in premature triumph in 1938'. 'The future British Prime Minister was by then already on the Nazi external intelligence payroll. He is reported by one source to have complained about encountering problems in repaying a loan from the Kent Education Committee, even though as indicated he was already on the German payroll and was initially being paid more than £250 annually, which was a very large sum for a pre-war university student'."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"566 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich 'After the war, MI5 arranged for Master Lindsay to travel to the British Occupation Zone in Germany, where he met the British c ounterintelligence officers working on the so- called De-Nazification Programme, which was a borted when the already penetrated OSS, parent of the American CIA, reversed its po licy under intense pressure from the US State Department led by George Kennan, and commenced the process which led to the importation and resettlement of at least 770 prominent Nazi scientists who had all been working on Heinrich Himmler's Black Satanic experiments and operations - including the development of occult psychopolitical personal and mass psycho-manipulation and personality modification techniques, and on rocket science and space travel innovations'. 'One source believes that Lindsay met with Brigadier Lathbridge, a senior British intelligence officer working in the British Zone . Lathbridge is reported to have been unaware of the continuing Nazi International secret intelligence service DVD, although he is also believed to have suspected the existen ce of a powerful Nazi organisation that was engaged in the protection of high-ranking Nazis and overseas Nazi intelligence assets who had been left in place in 1945'. 'One of these was Edward Heath. Further enquiries were reportedly blocked in London and by assets of the DVD within the Nazi-penetrated OSS, which controlled access to Munich, to which location Edward Heath's Abwehr (German external intell- igence) file had been transferred from the German Abwehr headquarters in Berlin'. 'Today, the London Station of the continuing Nazi International's DVD is shared with the overt German intelligence service , BND (Bundesnachrichten Dienst)'. It is accordingly clear that both Britain and the United States - jointly 'the Main Enemy'- have been continuously targeted by German 'B lack' Illuminati intelligence, and that it is Germany/France who are the 'Main Enemy's' dialectical antagonists. THE MURDER IN NUMBER 11 DOWNING STREET In the first quarter of 2006, a former Cons ervative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Tony Barber, also died. Shortly afterwards, the Au thor was informed by UK intelligence that Barber had also been an Abwehr agent. Th e outline information provided was as follows: 1. On being voted into power, Edward Heath appointed Ian Macleod, a highly res- pected colleague, to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer. 2. Ian Macleod duly reported to the Treasury Building, where he met his Permanent Secretary. The conscientious Whitehall manda rin proceeded to brief him in detail on the unsavoury consequences of the Euro-centric po licies which Heath intended to pursue. He showed Macleod, with the aid of statistics and charts, that membership of the European Economic Communities would, over the medium term, prove a disaster for the British economy, and would inter alia lead to the de-industrialisation of the country. 3. Macleod reported back to Mr Heath what he had been told, said that he would be unable to implement the policies that Heath had in mind, and requested fresh instructions. 4. Shortly thereafter, Ian Macleod dined with a certain Dr Foster, whose identity was not unknown to certain sections of the intelligence services. 5. Not long after dining with this Dr Foster, Ian Macleod died suddenly in Number 11 Downing Street. Having provided this information, the sourc es described this intervention as 'a murder in Number 11 Downing Street'. Ian Macleod was immediately replaced by To ny Barber, who proceeded to implement Heath's policy of integration into the European Economic Communities with zeal and to the letter. The British intelligence source s then provided the Author with a few"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 567 details about Tony Barber's background. It transpired that he had flown a Spitfire, equipped with Britain's latest 'spy-in-the-sky' camera, into Germany, where it had been handed over to the German authorities. He was imprisoned but betrayed his fellow prisoners over the famous 'Wooden Horse' episode. The briefing ended with a categorical statement that this former Chancellor of the Exchequer, like Heath was an Abwehr agent. CORRUPT 'PAYOLA' PAYMENTS 'FACILIT ATE' E.U. COLLE CTIVE TREATIES It is troublesome, but entirely consistent, apparently, with British pract ice, that traitors holding, or who have held, high official pos itions and are subsequently unmasked, are often left unprosecuted, but are exposed after their deaths. The Author believes this practice to be mistaken, since these people have invariably caused immense damage to the nation and society - and none more so than Edward Heath, whose si gnature (along with that of his colleague Geoffrey Rippon) on Brit ain's European Accession Treaty, is actually null and void. This state of affairs was now explained in the special analysis and exposure published in 'International Currency Review', as follows: 'The European Union Collective is without any doubt illegal - a point that the Author put to a very senior US intelligence source, intimately familiar with intergovernmental financial corruption, who immediately responded: 'I know'. The EU is illegal inter alia because: 1. Britain's Accession to the European Economic Communities was procured by fraud: Specifically, the two signatories, Edward Heath and Geoffrey Rippon, were not only paid Abwehr agents but received corrupt payments in exchange for their signatures on the UK accession documents. 2. British agreement to the Maastricht Treaty was allegedly procured through fraud: Specifically, the Prime Minister of the day, John Major, is alleged by intelligence infonnants to have accepted his 'facility payment' or payments. The documents were signed by Douglas (now Lord) Hurd and Angus Maude, who later became a senior figure in the 'Conservative' Party and, like his father, is very 'sympathetic' to Germany. 3. The European Constitution was procured by means of the distribution of corrupt payments, although following the French and the Dutch Referenda, it cannot be ratified. Specifically, $5.0 billion was set aside to procure completion of the European Constitution Treaty, the funds derived from a 'Black Operations' account in Switzerland called the 'SBC Charcol account. It holds or held at leas t $470 billion, built up originally from Nazi resources and continuing 'Black' financial operations, hidden 'high-yield investment programmes', and probably scams, with the funds made available for disbursement from a Credit Suisse account. 4. Of this $5.0 billion, $2.5 billion was to be distributed on completion of the Inter Governmental Conference (July 2004), and the second tranche of $2.5 billion was to be distributed on ratification. The funds were payable in Euros, of cour se, with $100 million equivalent allocated for each of the 25 EU countries in th e first tranche. This had to be distributed to the corrupted politicians and officials on completion of the Inter Governmental Conference (IGC) in July 2004. The Author obtained information about three of these sub-tranches: • The corrupt 'IGC facilitation' funds allegedly remitted to the (former) Italian Prime Minister, Sig. Silvio Berlusconi: Specifically, the Italian ex-Prime Minister was allegedly paid and accepted a total of €75 million. He could 'get away with' this b ecause his political rival, Sig. Romano Prodi, who became Italian Prime Minister after"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"568 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich narrowly 'defeating' Berlusconi in the 2006 General Election and who had been President of the European Commission at the relevant ti me, also allegedly received 'his' 'facilitation paymenf of €75 million. That is how 'busine ss' is routinely trans acted in the corrupt German-dominated European Union Collective. # The corrupt 'IGC facilitation' funds allegedly paid to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair: An equivalent allocation of €75 million was allegedly paid into a bank account with the Prime Minister as ultimate beneficiary in Belize. A sudden jump of $114.81 million in the foreign exchange reserves held by the Central Bank of Belize was noted in March 2005, perhaps signifying that the alleged corrupt payment was taken into the reserves so that the funds were either in the process of being 'laundered' through the Central Bank, or else had been seized. The local Central Bank would have been entitled to do this. THE 1969 VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES Intelligence sources had not, by the closure of this book, seen fit to furnish the Author with outline information about the corrupt payments made over to 'facilitators' for the 23 other EU countries at the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, but it is understood that the full $2.5 billion was duly paid out in Euros as arranged. Since these funds were 'never actually paid' - for public consumption purposes - they are de facto non- refundable and have been 'lost' to the controlling 'builders of Europe'. However, in conformity with the European Union's familiar corrupt and deceitful modus operandi, the institutions provided fo r by the 'Constitution Treaty' were being implemented anyway, notwithstanding that the Constitution Treaty could not be fully ratified due to the negative outcomes of the French and Dutch referenda on this issue in 2005. Concerning the second $2.5 billion originally derived allegedly from the 'SBC Charcol account via Credit Suisse, the fate of these funds remained unknown outside the intelligence community. Some of the EU countrie s have rushed to ratify, and in these cases, the second €100 million tranches will have been 'payable', explaining why certain EU countries ratified so quickly. In the cases of France and the Netherlands, the corrupt respective recipients of second tranche 'facilitation' fees were reported to be angry and disappointed that their enrichment had been delayed or scuppered for ever (as they may not be around when the next collective treaty enters the IGC stage). There is also known to be much covert wailing and gnashing of teeth at the fa ct that large sums have been squandered on a collective document that cannot be collectively ratified, as all 25 EU satrap Member States must ratify for the (illegal) treaty for it to acquire 'legality' -which, as indicated, is an impossibility since some of/all of the earlier treaties and the Constitutional Treaty were procured corruptly and thus illegally. Under the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, there are two key provisions which authorise a signatory power to abrogate a bilateral or multilateral treaty unilaterally, without giving the stipulated notice: 1. Where corruption has been demonstrat ed in respect of proc uring the treaty in th e first place, or in respect of any dimension of its implementation. The European Commission (EC) and all its offshoots permit, and are associated with, proven corrup tion on a monumental scale, while Britain's Accession Treaty was signed corruptly by two paid Abwehr agents. 2. Where there has been a material change of circumstances. A material change of circum- stances has surfaced into the daylight, to begin with, following the death of Sir Edward Heath. It has been revealed that he was an agent for a foreign power, accepted corrupt payments for his services, and lied to the Britis h people - and that he did all this on behalf"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 569 of a foreign power secretly driven by 'Bl ack' Nazi Continuum intelligence strategists. An even more disturbing material change of circumstances has arisen as a conse- quence of the bombing of the London Underg round, and of a bus, which took place on 7th July 2005 - and the attempted explosions perpet rated two weeks later. The situation in the weeks immediately following was so serious that the British Civil Contingencies Secretariat had been in the process of drafting, or has drafted, legislation providing for the British Government to abrogate its false international treaty 'obligations' towards the European Union Collective. The subsequent discovery that a fifth bomb was meant to have blown a hole in the Northern Line runnel beneath the River Thames, flooding the Underground and murdering thousands of Londoner s, was still being suppressed in mid- 2006, but was the subject of extreme unease and anger in certain London circles. In February 2006, an oil storage depot owned by the French energy corporation Total exploded at Buncefield, in Hertfordshire, outside London. The explosion and resulting fire was the worst conflagration in the United Kingdom since the Second World War. The 'mainstream' media immediately concluded that the catastrophic event was an accident, latching on to disinformation stories to the effect that a smell of petroleum had been noticed by local residents for weeks beforehand. In reality, this explosion was the work of the wholly bogus Al-Qaeda network a ssisted by the GO-2 British 'Black' inte lligence agency resident within MI6 (which it has ex tensively penetrated), and which 'reports' unofficially to the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst in Dachau. Although this atrocity was almost immediately hushed up, it hardened the resolve of 'white haf cadres within elements of the British intelligence community which have been fighting German/French penetration of the UK structures, to procure Britain's final exit from the German-sponsored long-range deception operation known as the European Union. GERMANY'S COVER: HIDING BEHIND THE SOVIETS Integral with the German-French operation to procure the total submission of the United Kingdom within the European Union Collective - the main purpose of which is to subdue and decapitate Britain, the senior component of the 'Main Enemy', once and for all - is a seamless continuation of the classic deception device whereby the Nazi Continuum hides behind a left-wing mantle. The European Union is a political collective, as Mikhail Gorbachev himself acknowledged during a brief visit to London on 23rd March 2000, when he concurred that the European Union is 'the new European Soviet'. But just as Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt* disguised their German Nazi sympathies and connections behind their supposed Communist fellow-travelling affiliations, and just as STASI operatives such as Marcus Wolf and Eva Teleki (who procured access to colossal funds transferred to her under Powers of Attorney, before allegedly failing to honour any of her obligations under those documents), maintained their STASI labels as their working cover long after the orchestrated 'collapse of Communism', so has German secret manipulation of the European Union been consistently masked by the left-wing, collectivist and manifestly Leninist structure of the EU Collective. Both Marcus Wolf and Eva Teleki were using their STASI backgrounds to * Anthony Blunt was believed to have been an illegitimate son of George V, and thus a half-brother of Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, whose Nazi predisposition was the underlying rationale for his {'enforced') abdication. Mrs Wallace Simpson was a German-financed operative, maximising t he potential of the long- implemented German espionage device, modelled upon Jesuit and llluminati practice, of positioning a 'psychopolitician' alongsid e key targeted figures, for subversion and intelligence purposes - earlier examples being Grigori Rasputin and the Abwehr operative Lavrentii Beria himself , who taught these techniques to foreign revolutionaries. Princess Diana was targeted in a similar manner. The slight problem that this Author has with the allegation concerning Anthony Blunt is that the Author's drawing master at Eton was none other than Anthony Blunts older brother, 'Willie' Blunt, who certainly resemb led Anthony Blunt physically except that his frame and build were much heavier. Willie' Blunt was a much-loved art teacher and an Eton 'fixture', who taught boys w ith talent how to paint, and haunted the somewhat remote Art Schools."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"570 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich hide the alleged reality that they actually work for Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, in furtherance of the long-range Nazi strategi c deception agenda in collaboration with the German-oriented segments of the CIA, including the Nazi-oriented CIA operation based in Frankfurt, with its Gehlen Organisation background. As this book was being finalised, the Au thor discovered that GO-2, the UK 'Black' intelligence agency (which is supposed, like the Nazi Continuum DVD, not to exist) controls two drug cartels in Britain, each of which 'services' the financial requirements of the main political parties, with the Liberal Democrats engulfed in comparable financial disarray surrounding dubious financing sources. The financial scandal surrounding the 'New Labour' Government led by Tony Blair which came to a head in March 2006 concerned loans extended secretly 'below the radar' to the Labour Party by a dozen or more big- headed industrialists, bankers, venture capitalists et al which were allegedly financed by the following mechanism. A self-important figure was cornered by Blair's 'financial gopher', Lord Levy, and persuaded to make funds available (for instance, for the 2005 election) on loan, with an unspoken implication that the 'lucky lender' would become eligible for a life peerage. In 1925, following the scandal over the sale of peerages (real, ongoing ones) by David Lloyd George - also a corrupted supporter of German hegemony plans, it has recently transpired - the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act was passed forbidding the practice. Under the legislation, it is an offence to take money as an 'inducement or reward' for procuring an honour for someone else, or even attempting to do so. The definition of 'reward' is not confined to money, but includes any 'valuable consideration' which would appear to cover an interest-free loan or indeed a loan at a commercial rate of interest. It is also an offence for a person who 'buys' an honour to give anyone money or a valuable consideration as an inducement for procuring an honour for him or anyone else. The maximum penalty under the Act is two years in jail*. Following a formal complaint by Angus MacNeil, a Scottish Nationalist MP, to the Metropolitan Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions in mid-March 2006 about disclosures that several 'wealth/ individuals were nominated for peerages after extending large loans to the Labour Party, the Metr opolitan Police announced (on 21st March 2006) that its Specialist Crime Directorate was looking into three complaints of alleged breaches of the 1925 law, associated with the secret loans policy run - according to the 'mainstream' media - out of Number 10 Downing Street. Other extraordinary corruption discoveries concerning the Labour leadership were surfacing in mid-2006. Such corruption is consistent with the system of unfettered secret 'payola' rewards which is the preferred method developed by the DVD as a means of furthering the European Union agenda. Behind the scenes, th e GO-2-controlled drug cartel 'attached to' the Labour Party is or was a primary source of slush funds, in a pos ition to channel funds to offshore accounts held in the names of the assorted big-headed in dustrialists, brokers, venture capitalists etc, considered to be lusting after a life peerage. Thus, in exchange for extending a loan of, say, £1.0 million 'to help Tony win the election', a deposit of £2.0 million would 'replace' the £1.0 million on loan, in an offshore account -which, if repaid, would net the corrupt lender £2.0 million plus interest. Behind this * Further, a seller of honours who has received a gift, money or consideration, may be ordered to forfeit it to the Crown. It was under the 1925 Act that a Mr Maundy Gregory was convicted of selling honours in 1933. He was fined £50 and jailed for six months. Gregory, an intelligenc e officer and friend of Lloyd George, had been ordered to obtain information on an MP called Victor Grayson, who was believed to be a Soviet agent and who wa s also enquiring about corruption and the honours system. When he found out that he was being watched, Grayson denounced Lloyd George at a publi c meeting for selling honours. He said: The sale of honours is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street, and to a monocle d dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man and one day I will name him'. The 'mo nocled dandy' was the intelligence officer, Maundy Gregory. Gra yson was subsequently beaten up in the Strand, and then disappeared. It was believed that he had been murdered, although his body was never found.

This of course explains why the 'Eurosceptics' in Britain, who flattened the 'Europhiles' long ago with their arguments (an operation with which this Author is closely associated), were never able to induce even a hint of any change of policy within the compromised and corrupted Conservative Party. Heavy penetration of all the UK political parties by Trilateralists' affiliated with the Trilateral Commission, founded as long ago as 1918 as an instrument of, and front for, German intelligence, also predisposed the main British political parties never to question the treacherous secret German policy of national suicide via EU integration. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), seen as a threat by the penetrated and compromised British Conservatives, was penetrated from the outset by agents serving the strategy of GO-2, and thus of the Dachau-based Deutsche Verteidigun gs Dienst. The first leader of the embrionic version of this Party, a young man known to the Author who possessed all the best leadership qualities and was a person of great integrity and magnetism, died suddenly and quite unexpectedly for no apparent reason in his early thirties, leaving his young wife devastated. This man was of such a high calibre that he would certainly have threatened the programme of the criminal elements in the intelligence services and elsewhere who were controlling the German integration strategy. The next leader, Alan Sked, narrowly escaped death when he was shot at. The Party was taken over by ineffective leadership, and the leader 'elected' in 2006, who has a German wife (from Berlin), was observed during a meeting giving what looked like a Hitler salute. ANGELA MERKEL 'DOES NOT WANT A THIRD WORLD WAR' Wholesale review of Britain's EU membersh ip followed the realisation within certain British intelligence and other circles that th e 7/7 and subsequent attacks in 2005, and the Buncefield oil depot catastrophe in 2006, amounted to acts of war against the United Kingdom, and that the foreign powers behind this activity are ultimately controlled by the Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (with collabora ting French 'Black' intelligence) from Dachau, the successor organisation to the Abwehr, N azi Germany's main external intelligence administration. The Nazi regime and its Stalinist dialectical counterpart were both Black Illuminati regimes. The Al-Qaeda operation is an extension of the same Black tradition, and is ultimately controlled, like the ERA (until very r ecently), by the DVD out of Dachau. In March 2006, a senior UK intelligence source told the Author that Angela Merkel - the German Chancellor - 'does not want a Third World War'. The implication was that this operative, born in Hanover but mysteriously educated in East Germany at the East German Academy of (Leninist) Sciences, is not as enamour ed as her predecessors (including Gerhard Schroder, also from East Germany) with the Nazi Continuum and global hegemony strategy directed from Dachau. However this assessment was contradicted by the Buncefield catastrophe, traced subsequently to Al-Qaeda acting as proxy for the DVD. Since that event - again controlled by French 'Black' intelligence which works hand-in-glove with the DVD - was interpreted as an act of war, although hushed up, there seemed, by June 2006, to be no concrete evidence that the arrival in power of Frau Merkel had led to any change of strategy. It is understood that Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst 'informs' the German Chancellor of what it is doing and what operations it may be planning, which strongly implies that it is a power unto itself"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"572 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich - a 'state within the state', like the CIA and its affiliates, not least since DVD is not funded by the taxpayer. It has its own criminalist funding sources, of course. Specifically, it specialises in heroin distribution, while the French and Spanish 'Black' agencies handle cocaine - Spain having become the alleged favoured European outlet for Bush Sr.'s drug operations focused on US/DVD-developed Latin American sources. In the summer of 2006, following exposure by this Author, the Spanish authorities ordered Bush Sr. to leave Spain and allegedly told his people to 'take your dirty money with you'. Detailed accounts of the European Union's corrupt 'payola' system, and of the recipients of certain corrupt remittances, were published in International Currency Review' in October 2005, in the supplementary service 'Economic Intelligence Review' in December 2005, and again in 'Global Analyst' [2006Q1] [www.worldreports.org]. In addition, a summary of the intelligence concerning the traitor Edward Heath and his British homosexual Abwehr contemporaries, and of the illegality of both Britain's EU membership and of the EU Collective's treaties, has been maintained on the Author's websites' easily accessed permanent Archive. In the December 2005 issue of 'Economic Intelligence Review', a list of all the journalists in the UK 'mainstream' media who ignored the fo regoing intelligence was published, in order to highlight the feckless incompetence of the media and that Illuminati financial control of the press and broadcasting is as comprehensive in Britain as has been the case in the United States since J. P. Morgan procured press control almost a century ago. The reason for mentioning these mundane facts is that not a single denial or refutation of any of the intelligence in question was forthcoming from official or private circles as a consequence if these damning exposures, during this period. On the contrary, British intelligence sources told the Author that no denials have been forthcoming because everything that the Author published is true. Further, given the camaraderie that exists among intelligence officers serving different governments at the professional level, elements of British intelligence have been congratulated, believe it or not, by their German Nazi Continuum (Abwehr-DVD) counterparts on the excellent counterintelligence job performed by 'white hats' in MI5 in establishing and exposing the facts. Instead of seeking to impose their wayward occult Dluminati will by force, as during the Second World War, the Nazi long-range pl anners changed their geostrategy and opted for a more gradualist, subtle and corrupt a pproach, which has basically entailed conquest by open-ended bribery. For what the European Union, planned from 1941 onwards, does is to collect colossal fees from its satrap (bribed) Member States, and to redistribute the proceeds effectively as bribes, in fu rtherance of its geopolitical objectives. E.U. DELIBERATELY MODELLED ALONG LENINIST LINES Since, as we have seen, German long-range strategy deception strategy hides behind left-wing labels when this is considered to be the best cover, the fact that the European Union is modelled along Leninist lines* should not be taken as indicating an incorrect strategic diagnosis on the Author's part. It has already been demonstrated that Communism and Fascism are two controlled ideologies that were deliberately concocted (initially by the 'two Karls') in order to provide the Illuminati manipulators with 'opposing dialectical forces' (Thesis, Antithesis) that could be mani pulated in the interests of the self-appointed globalist Illuminati elite to yield their 'Synthesis' of global control. The early Nazi Labour Day emblem shown in Figure 89 on page 551 displays both the Communists' hammer and sickle and the Nazi occultic swastika. * Governance is duplicated, and dec isions are taken collectively, although the weas el word used to mask this is 'cooperation'."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 573 But when we consider this disguise more carefully, it is even more striking. For what has emerged from this study is that throughout the long years of the overt Cold War, and continuing to this day, the long-range strategists within the Dachau-based DVD hid behind the STASI (East German security). This has recen tly become evident from observation of two key STASI operatives already mentioned - Marcus Wolf, and Eva Teleki (a.k.a. Sturzl). As has been reviewed, Marcus Wolf has been 'advising' the US Department of Homeland Security (although a different version has it that he was be ing 'debriefed' by them). He has also been seen dining in gentlemen's clubs in London, accompanied by several British intelligence officers. He was suddenly not available in Berlin when he became aware that an intelligence contact of this Author was intending to visit him there, several months after the Author publicised DVD penetration in the information detailed above. As for Ms Teleki, this STASI operative is known to have been working during the 1990s and certainly into the present century in cooperation with US intelli gence. She has access to substantial f unds repatriatable to the US Government, and was reported to have been resident in London from 2004 onwards, and therefore during the period of the atrocities that took place in July 2005. Intelligence experts on both sides of the Atlantic agree that as noted earlier, Sturzl, like Wolf, is indeed a DVD officer. She has Hungarian connections. THE GERMAN GEOPOLITICAL CENTRE To understand the significance of all this, it is necessary to recall that the Nazis established a high-level central planning organisation in Madrid in 1943, called the German Geopolitical Centre (or Deutsche Geozentrale) . On 13th December 1944, the Associated Press reported that Heinrich Himmler had initiated plans for the establishment of an underground network at the end of 1943, and that propaganda and related warfare operations were to be carried on 'by some 200,000 Nazi followers in Europe and elsewhere'. The news report, clearly based on reliable Alli ed intelligence, assert ed that many Nazi Party operatives and members had equipped themselves with double or even triple identities, and that the preplann ed Nazi agitprop operations we re intended to set the Allies against each other. The Nazi Geopolitical HQ in Madrid was funded for many years by financial and bullion resources, and doubtless by 'Black Ops' funds, exfiltrated into Spain long before the collapse of the Third Reich 30 . For years it was known that the Nazi headquarters in Madrid operated an international organisation called 'Die Spinne', meaning 'The Spider'. Related Nazi organisations were and are known by various exotic cover names, such as Edelweiss, Konsul, Scharnhorst, Sechsestirn, Liebwache and Lustiger Bruder, while the covert organisation of the Nazi Elite Guard operated under the name Odessa. THE 'MADRID CIRCULAR LETTER' On 29th May 1951, a correspondent for 'The New York Times', Mr C. L. Sulzberger, reported on the existence of an operational group which had 'revived' what he then called the Fascist International, and was functioning in various c ountries stretching 'from Malmo to Tangier, and from Rome to Buenos Aires'. There were likewise reports in the early 1950s that Hitler's Deputy, Herr Martin Bormann, 'shuttles between Spain and Argentina trying to work for unity and cooperation among Fascist-mi nded bodies', stated one report 31 . In September 1950, the German Geopolitical Centre in Madrid distributed a secret Memorandum to its many subsidiary centres around the world, including key German covert Nazi continuity circles in Bonn. The document, known as the 'Madrid Circular Letter',"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"574 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich which was intercepted by Western intelligence or leaked to an Allied intelligence service, represented a German General Staff plan for a revised German approach to procure the division and conquest of the world. At the time, UK/US observers realised that the policies outlined in the document coincided remarkably closely with the direction of those being quietly pursued by the Adenauer Government - which was hardly surprising, since before the Second World War, Konrad Adenauer, who became an Abwehr officer, had been Mayor of Cologne and was close to Hitler's favourite German bankers, Jewish gentlemen by the names of Abs and Pferdmenges. Before Adenauer became German Chancellor (and remember, the Chancellorship, we now know, is in the hands of the DVD in Dachau), he told the German Reichstag: 'We must move very cautiously. We ought not to give the impression, either in Germany or in the United States, th at we shall collaborate in any way with the Russians' - even though orientation towards Russia was secretly central to German strategy, as had always been the case, beginning with the disruptive operations of the German agent Rasputin in the Tsar's court and the recruitment of Lenin by German intelligence at the beginning of the 20th century when he was living in Munich. Likewise, Lavrentii Beria, Stalin's odious Inte rior Ministry police gauleiter, with almost more blood on his hands than Stalin himself, was, as has been discussed, a long-term German Abxvehr agent - a fact reflected not least in his move, immediately following Stalin's curious death, to initiate a settlement with West Germ any. As a result, Beria's service to German intelligence was used against him, and he was promptly executed 32 by Stalin's successors who, like Boris Yeltsin and (we understand) also Vladimir Putin, worked hard to exclude or diminish the influence of German intellig ence inside Soviet structures. Yet President Chirac was Chairman of a Tril ateral Commission', prior to b ecoming President of France, consisting of France, Germany and Russia - so that any Russian anti-German house- cleaning may have been less than comprehensive. 'FUR UNS IST DER KRIEG NIEMALS VORBEI' The West failed singularly to penetrate, let alone understand, the clandestine negotiations that proliferated between Bonn and Moscow, even though many statements in the German press suggested that Bonn's ultimate objective, following the establishment of the Adenauer Government in West Germany, wa s a far-reaching, long-range agreement with Moscow. Two years of secret negotiations between Berlin and Moscow preceded the Rapallo Treaty dated 16th April 1922, which was fa cilitated by the little understood fact that Lenin was also a German agent, whose original job it was to destabilise Russia in order to relieve the pressure on Germany from the Eastern Front. The Rapallo Treaty was concluded by a Jewi sh leader of German 'liberalism', Dr Walter Rathenau. Fifteen years later, when We stern statesmen, led by the naive British Prime Minister, imagined that they had pu rchased 'peace in our time' at Munich, the Germans yet again entered into secret negotiations with the Soviets, culminating in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (Mark I: see page 610 for Mark II) of August 1939. In 1953, T. H. Tetens, the remarkably prescient author of 'Germany Plots with the Kremlin', elaborated: 'The lightning that flashed throughout the world when Berlin joined hands with Moscow in 1939 is striking again and the ultimate target of the Germans is the USA' 33 . With the destruction of Berlin and the death of Hitler, the West generally assumed that the Nazi threat had ceased to exist - an illusion that arose due to the erroneous identification of the Nazi Party with Hitler, even as the identification of"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 575 the Iraqi 'enemy' with the image of Saddam Hu ssein led the Americans to assume, just as erroneously, that the Iraqi Ba'ath Party (modelled along Nazi lines, as it was a direct outgrowth of Nazi anti-British operations in th e Middle East), would cease to exist or have any substance with the arrest of Saddam. But the German Geopolitical Centre saw to it that Nazism and its worldwide idolatry would not merely survive the destruction of Hitler and the loss of the war, but would be strengthened as a consequence of deploying ne w, much more subtle 'Third Way' psycho- techniques, with additional stress on bribery. The Nazi International further instructed its outlets and cadres that, so far as the Geopolitical Centre was concerned, the war had never ceased, and would continue until complete victory was assured: 'Fur uns ist der Krieg niemals vorbei'. The Geopolitical Centre also boasted that it had successfully duped US policy planners. Thus the 'Madrid Circular Letter' explained: 'Germany has emerged from the Cold War as th e chief beneficiary. That is our great asset in the ledger ... since Potsdam. For the first time in the history of nations, it has been proven that clever propaganda, especially when it is camouflaged and directed through other channels, accomplishes far more than the mightiest army or the best diplomatic service of a smoothly functioning state. It is a great mistake to assu me that Western Germany recuperated so quickly thanks to America's sympathetic concern for us . We repeatedly encounter, especially as expressed by some politicians in Bonn, the idiotic opinion: 'But the Americans have put us back on our feet, should we th erefore not show our gratitude?' To this our answer is as follows: The Americans put us back on our feet, not purely for altruistic reasons but for their selfish interests and on the basis of clever calculations. It must not be our worry, but thei rs, if in the last resort their calculations prove to be abysmally stupid. We are not wholly innocent in [respect of] the shift of America's postwar policy 36 '. 'For us the war has never stopped [Fur uns ist der Krieg niemals vorbei'] and, as is well known, in war every ruse is permissible. We cannot repeat too often that Germany has never ceased to carry on the war with political wea pons and propaganda, with economic sabotage and other means'. 'In order to protect Germany against total destruction of all its military and economic potentials, as [in due course was] planned at Yalta, we [at the outset of the Second World War] blueprinted a bold plan and created a flexible and smoothly working organisation 35 which, during the first months of the war, provided the pre-cond ition for all the gains that by necessity emerged for Germany out of the chaos of the postwar period' [compare the Illuminati model of 'Order out of Chaos']. In other words, the long-range planning undertaken by Nazi planners and perfected by the German Geopolitical Centre in Madrid represented 'Plan B'. 'Today, five years after Potsdam, we can look back with pride on our accomplishments. By no means was the political and military leadership of the Third Reich skidded into the catastrophe [of the Second World War] in an irrational manner, as so many blockheads and ignoramuses often tell us. The various phases a nd consequences of the so-called 'collapse' (of the 'Zusammenbruch') were thoroughly studied and planned by the most capable experts' ('faehigsten Koepfen'). Nothing occurred by chance; everything was car efully planned. The result of all this planning was that, already a few months after Potsdam, the coalition of the victors went on the rocks'. In other words, the German long-range planners had judged their enemy correctly, even though they knew that it belonged, at the highest levels, like them, to the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"576 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich EXPLOITATION OF POSTWAR CHAOS AND THE SOVIET 'MENACE' The essence of the subtle deception strategy developed by the Nazi planners was to alarm the Americans about the imagined 'Soviet menace' to stability in Europe - seeds of deception that fell on fertile ground because of the scale of the long-term, and recent, penetration, of the US policymaking and intelligence structures by Nazi moles: 'The machinery which we had prepared so carefully in advance, had very con- sciously brought about conditions and situa tions after the collapse, which confronted America's leaders with the stark choice of accepting chaos and Bolshevism throughout Germany, or adopting a constructive programme that would save Germany and the whole of Europe. Such a plan and such a bold programme could only be successfully carried out by a political schooling that is now proved to have been of paramount importance'. It was only necessary to warn of the danger of Communism taking hold in Germany after any collapse by referring to the brief localised experiments with Bolshevism attempted in Germany after its defeat in the First World War. And the central importance of the clandestine Geopolitical Centre in Madrid was now clearly revealed: 'When we take into consideration under wh at tremendous difficulties and dangers the organisation had to work in an underground manner and directed from abroad without any protection or backing by any state, carefu lly watched and persecuted by agents of a revengeful enemy, then the successful outcome seems like a miracle'. The 'Madrid Circular Letter' boasted, therefore, that the Nazi geopolitical apparatus organised Germany's postwar chaos: 'In order to bring the Americans b ack to reason and away from Potsdam, we organised chaotic conditions in a thorough and systematic manner ('haben wir mit grundlicher Systematik das Chaos organisiert'). 'It was', the 'Madrid Circular Letter' continued, 'a very subtle political resistance, seemingly unorganised and seldom visible, but nonetheless having a deadly effect. The peasants were delivering almost next to not hing to the cities; no coal was being brought up from the pits, the wheels of industry were not turning; the people came near to starvation; the monetary system was disintegrating: there remained nothing for the Yankees to do but to give up and scrap the Potsdam program...'. 'Five years after Potsdam, the Yankees are stuck deep in the mud; they are now seeking the advice of our generals whom they formerly called criminals; they come pleading for our help against Russia. That of which we could never convince the world, namely, the injustice of the policy of revenge, was finally accomplished by the Americans themselves who, speculating on German help, have pro pounded the necessity for a revision of policy towards Germany. They have even convinced the French and the English of this'. Concerning Germany's geopolitical orientation, this crucial document, which rep- resented a blueprint for covert Nazi polic y for years to come, had this to say: 'The policy of orientation towards the West has lost all political meaning or sense. A conscious policy of neutrality, going hand-in-ha nd with close economic cooperation with the East would, from a long-range point of view, supersede a mere ly pro-Soviet orientation.... We must not forget that Germany has always considered orientation towards the West as a policy of expediency, or one to be pursued only under pressure of circumstances. Such was the case in Napoleon's time, after 1918, and also after 1945. All our great national leaders have constantly counselled the long-range policy of close cooperation with the East: thus, Frederick the Great, the Count von Stein, Bismarck, von S eeckt, and Brockdorff-Rentzau, and, in over the past 30 years, all our leading geopoliticians...'."},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 577 Thus the Nazi experts working out of the German Geopolitical Centre and its off- shoots revealed their clear understanding of the Illuminati's dialectical method of creating 'opposing forces' and manipulating them in pursuit of the strategic 'synthesis': 'We must never let ourselves become befogged by Washington's stupid and mean- ingless slogans about the so-called 'Struggle of Democracy versus Communism'. The so- called American democracy does not deserve the sacrifice of the bones of even a single German soldier. In the age of regimented and militarised economy [sic], the US babbling about democracy and so-called 'free enterprise ' is such nonsense that we do not need to squander a single moment in refuting this American propaganda swindle'. 'What Germany needs in the future is no t democracy but a system of statecraft similar to that of the Soviet dictatorship which would enable the political and military elite in Germany to organise the industrial capacity of Europe and the military qualities of the German people for the revival of the German race and the re-establishment of Europe as the power centre in the world'. This statement included a clear indication that German intelligence considers itself to be the power behind the Soviets and Soviet intelligence - a state of affairs that has prevailed since even before the days of Lenin and Ra sputin, their agents. German intelligence has been working covertly behind the false Communist red flag, with Britain and the United States always their main targets. The mentality of this postwar Nazi International blueprint document, and the intentions contained therein, are self-evident. The European Economic Communities [the EEC] were organised covertly by German 'Black' intell igence in accordance with the 'Madrid Circular Letter' blueprint - buttressed in January 1963 by the signing by the Abwehr agent Konrad Adenauer of the Tr eaty of the Elysee, which is of indefinite duration, with President de Gaulle. That key Treaty provides that Germany and France must 'achieve a common position' in advance of all internati onal conferences, meetings, and consultations and in all international forums, in which they are represented. Specifically, the Treaty lays down in international law that 'the two Govern ments will consult before any decision on all important questions of foreign policy and, in th e first place, on questions of common interest, with a view to reaching as far as possible an analogous position'. Mutual interpenetration of French and German intelligence cadres is sanctioned. DEER CORRUPTING PENETRATION BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE The ghastly problem faced by both Britain and the United States is that loyalties within their intelligence communities are divided, reflecting deep, long-range foreign penetrations - with competing US intelligence groups fronted by powerful 'barons' owing allegiance, for various penetration, blackmail and other reasons - to foreign powers. The key sources of these tensions are penetrations by German, Soviet, Chinese, Japanese and French intelligence - with the Germans in the driving seat, given their long- established postwar penetration of the CIA. Cadres loyal ultimately to the DVD constantly denigrate the British. The German Ge opolitical Centre located in Madrid, with its satellite planning centres in Barcelona and Seville, which developed the postwar covert Nazi blueprints and organised the penetrations of components of the British, French, Canadian and US intelligence communities, operated for years as well-camouflaged commercial enterprises, or a lternatively as German relief organisations. According to public domain German press reports 36 , the primary Nazi International centres were established in Madrid and also Rome, from which locations control was projected and maintained over an exten-"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"578 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich sive network of intelligence operations in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America, North America via the CIA, Africa, the Far Ea st, both Germanys, and also the Soviet Bloc. Subsequently a further Nazi International Centre was opened in Cairo, to direct anti- Western activities in the Arab world - resulting in due course in the neo-Nazi regimes established in Baghdad, Damascus and, for a time, Egypt itself. Egyptian Presidents Nasser and Anwar Sadat were both agents of German intell- igence, as the British Prime Minister of the day, Sir Anthony Eden, well understood. But he was himself surrounded by assets of German intelligence, and was double-crossed by General Eisenhower who, given both his military intelli gence knowledge and his German origins, must certainly have been aware that Nasser was a ke y Germany (DVD) asset. It is now more clearly understood that President Eisenhower betrayed Britain and France, prior to the capitulation of General de Gaulle to the Abwehr operative Dr Adenauer in 1963. Sir Edward Heath, as we have seen, was recruited by the Abwehr, was controlled for six decades by Nazi intelligence (DVD), and wa s only made to face up to his past in 2003, when he was visiting Salzburg ostensibly for the music festival, but in reality en route to Dachau - where the DVD delivered their warning that British intelligence were a bout to unmask him (which duly happened internally). After the end of the Second World War, the US State Department and the British Foreign Office made no serious attempts to smash the vast Nazi geopolitical network, although the US Assistant Secretary of State, Spruille Braden, tried to smoke out these covert Nazi conspirators. But he was blocked at every turn, just as the Joint Intelligence Committee and Number 10 Downing Street prevented the interrogation of Sir Edward Heath, which would have yielded crucial intelligence, not least relevant to the prevailing wave of terrorism attacks. As for the Pentagon, its policy towards Mr Braden's efforts was typically myopic, with General Patton being on record as making the ridiculous - yet Freudian - statement that 'the Nazis ar e the same as Democrats and Republicans' 37 . Within no more than half a decade, leading pan-Germ an journalists and Nazi officials who had served Dr Joseph Goebbels' propaganda machine, together with experienced Nazi diplomats from von Ribbentrop's Nazi German Foreign Office, were designing B onn's foreign policy, under guidance from Dachau, in Dr. Adenauer's Government. NAZI PERSONNEL FAN OUT INTO WEST GERMANY The main contacts of the German Geopolitical Centre staff in Spain and elsewhere were reportedly with people holding influential positions in West Germany, especially the Bonn Government's Foreign Office. During a debate in the Bonn Parliament on 16th October 1951, the 'former' Abwehr operative, Dr Konrad Adenauer, admitted that 134 'former' Nazi Party officials who had previously served under Ribbentrop in the overt Nazi Foreign Office, now held senior positions in the new Government's foreign service. Other well-known Nazis and specialist pan-German geopoliticians slid seamlessly into top positions at leading German newspape rs, broadcast outlets and magazines. As a consequence, a steady stream of information and instructions flowed between the Madrid Geopolitical Centre and its collaborators in Germany and elsewhere in the world, including inside the CIA, and vice versa. A careful examination of the entire 'Madri d Circular Letter' reveals an iron deter- mination to achieve realisation of the Nazi Thousand-Year Reich, even if it takes a thousand years to achieve. In the European theatre, the German geopoliticians envisaged the creation of a united Europe under German domination."},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 579 In order to achieve this object ive, the document elaborated: 'We have placed our confidential agents, observers, and representatives for special assignments in all groups and parties - ev en among Communist organisations and their fronts. The greater the number of organisations controlled and influenced by us, the more effective will be the results of our work' - c ode for the massive penetration of Western, including US, organisations, think-tanks, parliaments and intelligence services. And several of these agents were to become Prime Ministers of Great Britain. For his part, Edward Heath set about immediately to implement the German Geopolitical Centre's plan to neutralise and decapitate British power once and for all. The process had started with the Boer War, when the Germans instigated the Boers to fight the British; and it has been going on ever since, extended subsequently to the United States. Canada has its own problems, with the French DGSE causing endless confusion. The foregoing statement was accompanied by more boasting about the efficiency of the German Geopolitical Centre in its direct ing of postwar operations and the worldwide clandestine affairs of the Nazi International: 'Even after the collapse (in 1945), the National Socialist Party continued to work in a camouflaged way ('getarnt') inside dozens of se emingly innocuous societies and groups, in order to keep alive and undiluted the National outlook of the German people. In just the same way as many small brooks go towards making up a mighty stream, the various nationalistic and radical groups in the Zonen-Reich implemented, almost without exception, worthwhile and powerful propaganda. Each of these groups had its special task and had to adjust its work in line with certain situations and circumstances'. 'However, it was of chief importance to direct the underlying trend of the patriotic propaganda towards the identical objective. The more diverse and unconnected that all these groups appeared to be on the surface, the less they were apt to arouse suspicion that they were directed and influenced by a central organisation' - which they were. THE GERMAN 'MISSION TO LEAD THE WORLD' ['Fuhrermission'] As for the ideological imperative embedded in these instructions from Madrid, it was epitomised by the following ruthless, merciless, hardnosed Nazi assertions, which are identical to the training received, to this day, by special Illuminati cadres, including US intelligence officers whose alle giances diverge from the interests of the American people: 'The future of the world will be decided by the conquering force of political ideology. 'Democracy' is a wishy-washy term.... No Germ an is willing to fight and die for democracy. The German people, well trained and steele d under National Socialist leadership, are dominated by two sovereign ideas: the concept of a German Reich, and Germany's mission in the world ('deutsche Fuhrermission in der Welt'). These two ideas have given our people a powerful driving force for the dynamic execution of their world mission'. 'The mystical element and the religious tradition embodied in the concept of the Reich, sparks our political mission'. Translation: 1. The concept of a German Reich' = The European Union Collective 2. 'Germany's mission in the world' = Projection of global influence and power by clandestine means, as described throughout this book. 3. 'Mystical element' = Interaction with, a nd impregnation of strategy and behaviour by, the occult, as developed under Himmler, in line with German Illuminati practice. 4. 'Religious tradition' = The orientation of German Catholicism, especially, in the service of continuing German (covert Nazi) strategy, embracing idolatry."},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8: T H e Thousand-Year Reich Living comfortably in Spain and working in their plush Madrid offices, the Nazi intellectuals had no day-to-day responsibility for the direction of affairs - just as the underlying covert Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) now spends 100% of its energies and resources on planning. The Geopo litical Centre likewise devoted all its extensive financial and intellectual resources to planning for the survival and eventual physical realisation of the Thousand-Year Re ich - funding its operations by criminal activities. For instance, the paymaster of the 2005 London bombing attacks is believed to have been a 'former' STASI (DVD) operativ e who moved from the United States to an apartment in London after acquiring access to vast US Government offshore funds. The 'Madrid Circular Letter' then concluded with the following bombastic flourish, which represented a defiant challenge to the whole world: 'The convulsive effects of the military defeat have not broken the German spirit. The national tradition is carefully fostered among the youth and the veterans. The biological substance of the German people remained unshaken in its foundation'. 'Our people are ready to be called upon for historic decisions.... National training and political schooling have also conditioned the German people as a first-class instrument for the execution of world politics on a grand style. No other people on earth has such political maturity, fanatical faith, such iron-clad willpow er and tactical flexibility - not merely to overcome defeat, but also to start again from scratch. German tradition and belief in a world mission uplifts the whole German nation. Everyone senses within his deepest consciousness that the great national task - the struggle for world domination - will ultimately be crowned with victory'. This makes it clear that the Illuminati's 'project' for global hegemony, which, as has been explained, is directed from Germany, provides deep cover for long-range German global control strategy (Deutschland Uber Alles). Whether the German covert 'Black' Nazi Continuum intelligence establishment at Dachau is 'free-riding' aboard the Illuminati's programme, has hijacked it for its own purposes, or is fully and historically integrated within the Dluminati framework and agenda is, for the time being, a frustratingly unanswered conundrum. Whatever the truth of this vital question, the practical reality is that the United States is plagued by a German-oriented Illumi nati Masonic Fifth Column which has spread its poisonous occult influence with ruthless persisten ce at least since the establishment of Skull and Bones at Yale College in the 1830s - consolidating the geoma-sonic penetration for which it was originally responsible with the very founda tion of the Masonic Republic in 1776. This is not a healthy state of affairs; and to begin the arduous process of pu tting their decaying, corrupted house in order, US patriots could do a lot worse than to initiate a campaign for the removal of the emblem of the Illuminati from the $1.0 bill, together with all the other occult symbols displayed thereon. Such a development would give the Illuminati conspiracy a profound and long overdue shock. THE SECRET ALLIED 40-YEAR OCCUPATION AGREEMENT Notwithstanding the decisive differences that indeed opened up within months of victory among the Allies, President Truman's Secretary of State, James Byrnes, suggested that the four occupying powers should enter into an agreement to occupy Germany for 40 years. Secretary Byrnes' proposal bridged the two approaches to the management of postwar Germany - President F D. Roosevelt's assessment that the victors should seize Germany's material assets and should preclude a ny resurgence of German nationalism and industrialism; and the prospectus advanced by the allies of the pan-German Nazis,"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 581 led by George Kennan at the US State De partment, who peddled the notion that Germany should be converted from a heavily defeated power into an ally of the United States. Of course the people who were pushing this dangerous idea were either Abwehr recruits, or else were beholden later to the secret Nazi intelligence organisation, DVD. These people became increasingly influential and as a consequence, the rehabilitation of Germany and the mobilisation of its manpower became US policy. When James Byrnes was replaced by General Marshall, with hi s Plan, and George Kennan then became Chief of the US State Department's Policy Planning Division, the Pentagon's planners, and the political blueprint of the appeasers, achieved hegemony - while the de- Nazification operation was abandoned, and large numbers of Himmler's scientists were transferred to the United States and integrated at once into the US intelligence, scientific and academic communities, and into what Dwight Eisenhower had referred to as the military- industrial complex. All caution was thrown to the winds, and any anxieties surrounding the long-term objectives of the 'surviving' Nazis were abandoned, while the notion that they and their heirs might still be capable of long-term planning, was dismissed out of hand. Moreover the popular impression that the death of Hitler represented the de facto end of Nazism achieved respectability within the US policymaking and, for its own self- interested purposes, the intelligence communities. Even so, Secretary of State James Byrnes' proposal survived his replacement, and Germany was indeed occupied for a further period of 40 years - which was why the Berlin Wall was pulled down only in 1989 - under the direction of GRU officer, Vladimir Putin, who was bribed and further promised $30 billion of US 'set-aside' funds for his pains. He was pressing for payment of the $30 billion outstandi ng as late as October 2006, and the Author was instrumental in urging th e point that he needed to be paid, given the Bush II Administration's designs on Iran The vengeance of a woman spurned may prudently be assumed to be nothing to that of a Soviet GRU Officer double- crossed by US intelligence. THE PRINCIPAL TARGET: WASHINGTON In the 1940s, the pan-German Nazi strategi sts had calculated that by exploiting the antagonism between Stalin's USSR and the West, the Allies would in the end be left with no choice but to rehabilitate Germany; and their behind-the-scenes campaign to procure this outcome proved brilliantly successful. The en tire operation was fronted in Washington by George Kennan, who, like Heath, had been recruited by the Abwehr and/or by Nazi intelligence during his visits to the country before the war. As US News and World Report explained in 1949: 'George Kennan , the No. 1 brain truster in the State Department, has a new [sic!] idea that the US had better put its faith in Germany, rather than in France, as the bulwark against Russia' 38 . In the following month, the secret Nazi Abwehr operative, by now the German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, was openly asserting that Germany would regain its military power: 'Konrad Adenauer of Western Germany, is crossing up [sic] high Allied officials in Germany with his open talk about the re building of German military power. That subject was supposed to be kept under cover' 39 . And the German strategists rejoiced in the vast input of finance that the United States was pouring into German y's rehabilitation. In Septem ber 1951, the United States News reported that the United States had transf erred $9.0 billion into Western Germany and that 'the Germans took it for granted' 40 . That was exactly as the Nazis intended. From all this it can be seen that the recruitment by Nazi intelligence of Edward"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"582 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich Heath in Britain repres ented no more than one key penetration - albeit arguably the most sensational intelligence penetration in modern history, if one excludes such penetrations as the KGB's control over the West German Chan cellor Willy Brandt, which may have been tied up with the interpenetration of the Soviet and German intelligence communities; or the eastward orientation of Hans-Dietrich Gens cher, the long-serving West German Foreign Minister, who shadowed KGB operative Andrei Gromyko (Katz) as Soviet Foreign Minister. Genscher hailed from Hesse, East Germany, which he or his wife visited once a month, even while he served as Foreign Minister. From the German Geopolitical Centre's perspective, the penetration of US intelligence and its ultimate control by Nazi cadres was a far greater challenge and imperative. Those few, including this Author, who have been suggesting in recent years that 'the Third Reich has installed itself in Washington DC , guided by the pan-German neo-Nazis, with their brutal, occultic Illuminati mentality within the CIA and its subsidiary agencies, have only to re-read the statement by that brilliant American analyst of the early 1950s, T. H. Tetens, to understand that he saw, well over half a century ahead of events, what would happen: 'The Germans intend to build their new world empire on the ruins of what today constitutes the greatness and power of the United States. Whether these professional plotters will help the Soviets destroy America by military means, or whether they will attempt to subjugate us some day through an 'inside job', is of no relevance'. 'The fact that the German planners regard the United States as doomed becomes clearly visible from the writings of the [Naz i] geopoliticians. The schemers in the Madrid Geopolitical Centre have quite openly described how the United States will be thrown onto the rocks. They are dreaming of building up a new Third Power bloc, and they declare that 'this new power combination would plunge the United States down from its dizzy heights', and they boast that it would depend entirely on their \"diplomatic and propaganda finesses when and how we would take over an Ameri ca enfeebled by its foreign and domestic policies'\" 41 . THE 'COUP D'ETAT BY INSTALMENTS' MODEL The heirs of the German Nazi geopoliticians hold such sway in Washington 'as we speak' that a sizeable constituen cy of observers has concluded that the country is on the verge of slipping into th e clutches of a dictatorsh ip. The intention, indeed, is to change the US Constitution and political structures from within. It was on 23rd March 1933 that newly elected members of the German Reichstag met in a Berlin opera house (the Kroll) to review the passage of the 'Ermachtigungsgesetz' (Hitler's Enabling Act), the official title of which was 'Law for Removing the Distress of the People and the Reich'. There were many o pponents of this drastic proposed legislation, which those who suspected that Hitler was beyond dangerous, feared would give him the dictator ial powers that he was lusting after - and would remove necessary constitutional protections against tyranny. The Reichstag members had to meet in th e Kroll Opera House b ecause their building had been attacked and set on fire on 28th Febr uary 1933 - the Reichstag Fire - which had resulted in Hitler exerting pressure on the rapidly ageing President Hindenburg to suspend Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution - allowing the suspension of constitutional protections and liberties during emergency conditions. The privacy of postal and electronic commun ications, the states' rights of self-gov- ernment, all protections against unlawful searches and seizures, freedom of the press"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 583 and assembly and property rights, were all susp ended, and the so-called 'Enabling Act' was passed shortly afterwards. The staged putsch was part of 'a coup d'etat by instalments' 42 : and many concerned observers see exactly the same pattern unfolding today in both the United States and Britain: 'Only by banning the Communist deputies and by resorting to intimidation and mendacity did Hitler secure on March 23 [1933] the necessary two-thirds vote in the new Reichstag for an Enabling Act that transferred legislative authority to his Cabinet, ostensibly for four years. Waves of Nazi purges followed, as one institution after another was subjugated. Arbitrary rule replaced gove rnment by law in what has aptly been termed a 'coup d'etat by instalments'. 'By the summer, all parties except the Nazis had been dissolved, Hugenberg had been forced out of the Cabinet, and Hitler had relegated Papen to insignificance by winning the trust of the President. Even earlier, Goring had wrested from von Papen control over the Government of the largest state, Prussia. Well before the Nazi leader [had] assumed the powers of the Presidency upon the death of Hindenburg in August 1934, he had become the dictator of Germany . It was Hitler's very close associate Hermann Go ring who proclaimed that 'the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger' 44 . Shortly after the London atrocities on 7th July 2005, the American Congress made haste to proceed with renewal of the USA Patriot Act, minus its crucial sunset clause. Furthermore Congress designed to eliminat e or nullify the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, which would open the door for President George W. Bush to become permanent President (dictator) of the United States 45 . No bill followed, but it will be recalled that during the run-up to the 2000 General El ection, George W Bush Jr. pronounced (or 'quipped'): 'If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator'. In mitigation, George Bush Jr. was reacting to an unreported and failed attempt to assassinate him. The former, Chicago School-educated US Attorney General, Mr John Ashcroft, defended the USA Patriot Acts, which perfor m largely the same functions as Hitler's 1 933 Ermachtigungsgesetz, with the following warning: To those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve' 46 . THE NEW 9/11 'REICHSTAG FIRE' EVENT It was demonstrated at the beginning of Chapter 7 that the New York Twin Towers were demolished by means of explosives located below ground level - consistently with the Dark Forces' statement in Protocol 9 of 'The Protocols', cited earlier, that 'the undergrounds, metropolitains, those subterranean corridors which, before th e time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air...'. Following the Underground explosions in London on 7/7, explosions occurred below ground level in central San Francisco (in August 2005), and elsewhere. On 3rd June 2006, 17 people, mainly of Islamic origin, were arrested in connection with a conspiracy which would supposedly have included attacks and explosions in the Toronto Subway System.

The Twin Towers were brought down by an 'inside job' (see Chapter 7 and below), which is why the Author and others are justified in referring to 9/11 as a 'Reichstag Fire' event - intended as the catalyst to kick-start the Illuminan's uncontrolled offensives and open-ended aggression against humanity for the 21st century. This murderous provocation facilitated the passage of the USA Patr iot Act at lightning speed, even though Congressmen had had no opportunity to read it. Since it is impossible to generate such a complex and lengthy piece of le gislation in a matter of days, the draft text had been prepared long in advance, which provid es further evidence of pre-planning. The original USA Patriot Act authorised (a nd its sequels permit) US officials and agents to conduct arbitrary searches of private homes and businesses, and to search through personal belongings without informing the target or victim and without a court order, while agents can arrest and detain individuals and hold them indefinitely, without them having to be charged with any crime and with no access at all to an attorney - so that Habeas Corpus is a freedom of the past, and the Fourth Amendment protections against illegal searches and seizures, as in Nazi Germa ny, have been expunged.

BOREN, GEORGE TENET: COVERING FOR THE DVD, DACHAU? In March 2006, the Author discussed key 9/11 issues with a certain impeccable source with special connections, located in the United Stat es. The informant confirmed the main outlines of independent research on 9/11 that has appeared on the Internet and in book format. He referred specifically to the 9/11 operation by its codename of 'Able Danger', and mentioned that key implemented allegedly included the former Democrat Oklahoma Senator (1979- 94) David L. Boren, subsequently President of the University of Oklahoma, (who was allegedly forced to resign on 15th November 1994 in the context of a homosexual scandal, although this was not revealed to his constituents or his close associates at his home town, Norman, OK); George Tenet whose mentor was David Boren, who reportedly convinced incoming President George W. Bush Jr. to keep Tenet en poste as Director of Central Intelligence (CIA); and Vice President Richard Cheney, who 'interfaced with Operation 'Able Danger'. Some details of former Senator Boren's background w ill be helpful before the Author's conversation is related. Boren graduated from Yale University in 1963, having spent his final year being brainwashed as a member of the occult-esoteric 'crash course' for prospective high-flyers, Skull and Bones. He then followed the usual path of the 'chosen' as a Rhodes Scholar at"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 585 Oxford University, from which he is said to have graduated in 1965, even though degree courses at Oxford last for three years. He subsequently attended the University of Oklahoma Law School, in his home town of Norman, from which he graduated in 1968, when he was admitted to the Oklahoma Bar. He was elected a member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1967-75, and was Governor of Oklahoma from 1975 to 1977. In the following year he was elected as a Democrat to the US Senate, and was re-elected in 1985 and 1990, resigning four years later, having served as the Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. He b ecame President of the Univers ity of Oklahoma in 1994. According to Professor W. Scott Thompson, of Tufts University, a member of Boren's Rhodes Scholar class at Oxford University, in 'The Price of Achievement' [London, Cassel, 1985], 'I was aware that David [Boren] was gay before I was aware of my own homosexuality, and our scout [O xford University servant] confirmed it.... His homo- sexuality was never too far from the surface' . Thompson has also mentioned 'rumours of trouble with page boys at Oklahoma Capitol', during Boren's time as State Legislator, and believes that Mr Boren's surprise resignation in 1994 from his US Senate seat was 'almost surely prompted' by fears of 'a deeper degree of outing'. The same source has also referred in print to 'reasonably well-attested stories of continued gay imbroglios on Capitol Hill'. According to the Norman (OK)-based analyst, Michael Phillip Wright, one of the very best in the business, 'in 1993, 'Queer Nation' activist Michael Petrelis began publicly to accuse Boren of sexually harassing his male staff members. While allegedly concealing this from his constituents in Oklahoma, in 1994 Boren announced his resignation from the US Senate and allegedly leveraged his political influence to have himself appointed President of the University of Oklahoma. A considerable amount of further information on Boren's alleged homosexual predilections exists in the public domain. Michael Wright, who lives in Norman, Boren's home town, implictly linked this orientation to Boren's political affiliations, with which they were complementar y, writing as follows in his excellent self- published article entitled 'CIA Support for Bin Laden: Who's Responsible?' [September 2001]: 'The current crisis calls for Americans to investigate the records of all Congress members who approved of any legislation enabling US support for the Afghan rebels during the 1980s. Those who supported this hideous adventure deserve severe judgment' - not least, this Author would like to add, because US intervention hardened the cynical Leninist resolve of the Soviets to prosec ute the war in accordance with the Leninist method of proceeding 'by other means'. All of a sudden, Moscow folded its war in Afghanistan, but did so with the clear intention of gaining the upper hand later ('one step forward, two steps back': Lenin). For when the Soviets left, they took with them between 40,000 and 50,000 young Afghani males, many of whom had been seized from their homes at night, and were never seen by their families again - at least, not for many years. It is believed that these youths and boys underwent rigorous 'jihad' indoctrination and training as Islamic terrorists, while being educated in various terrorism training centres all over the USSR and the Communist Bloc, including East Germany, Poland and Hungary; and that the 'graduates' from this pool of rootless young Afghanis surfaced as the radicalised, controlled Islamic maniacs we know and loathe today. Mr Wright continued: 'As an Oklahoman, I am particularly interested in the record of former Senator David Boren, whose close ties to the CIA are well known. He was appointed to the Intelligence Committee in 1985, and later became its Chairman. Boren' - whom, it will be recalled, served in politics as a Democrat - 'also has close ties to the"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"586 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich extreme right. Political Research Associates, a group whose purpose is to expose the threat to democracy presented by right-wing groups, includes Boren as a member of one of the organizations which they have targeted for concern'. 'Boren was co-chairman of the Congressional Division of the National Coalition for Peace through Strength (CPTS), a creature of the American Security Council (ASC). The CPTS believed that the USSR and Communism were the greatest evils in the world'-thus sharing the opinion of Bill Ca sey on this score, and accordingly tending to downplay or even turning a blind eye to other contemporary evils and abominations. 'Other CPTS members included Ronald Reag an, Phyllis Schlafley, and Jesse Helms. Organizational members have included the American Conservative Union, the American Legion, Citizens for Reagan, Young Americans for Freedom, and Young Republicans. Political Research Associates also says that emigre groups with a history of association with Nazis were included in the CPTS membership'. 'One of the more prominent ASC members was Major General Milnor Roberts, Chairman of the Committee for a Free Afghanistan (CFA). During the 1980s proxy war, the CFA promoted US support for the Islamic militan ts whose successors are now being accused of the September 11 attack'. Depending upon which dialectical delusion a person entertains, you can therefore take your pick: are today's Islamic terrorists the successors of the militants trained and exploited by the US military and it s intelligence aborninators, or are they the Afghan graduates and their successors from th e Soviet Bloc terror schools which flourished intensively following the Soviets' exit from Afghanistan, or the thousands of Iraqis transferred to the United States following the Fi rst Gulf War? And to what extent are today's terrorists the successors and heirs of the Nazi terror squads and organisations spawned by the German intelligence operation established in the 1920s to destab ilise the British in the Middle East, the Muslim Brotherhood? Welcome to the subterranean world of the Illuminati, whose modern 'refounder', Adam Weishaupt, it will be recalled, decreed th at 'there must (a la Jesuite) not a single purpose ever come in sight that is ambiguo us, and that may betray our aims against religion and the state. One must speak sometimes one way and sometimes another,... so that, with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable'. DOUBLE-MINDEDNESS, DOUBLE -SPEAK, 'BAIT AND SWITCH' Double-mindedness and double-speak - replicated in the two-faced, criminalised elements of the intelligence community as 'bait and switch', when 'Mr Nice' abruptly becomes 'Mr Nasty' - is of the essence, spawning the fretting deception methodology of the dialectic, and the practices of speaking out of both sides of one's mouth, supporting opposite causes, working on both sides of any divide, and appearing pleasant and normal during the daytime, but bestial and depraved at nigh t; with a schizophrenic propensity to switch temper suddenly from a pleasant demeanour to, say, hideous, obscene anger. Integrated with this sick mentality and split-personality norm of behaviour is Weishaupt's Jesuitical law that the sect of the Illuminati must always operate under false flags, must always reside within, and piggyback upon, other organisations, and must never allow itself to be 'surfaced' as a 'tangible' organisation (which, however, is exactly what it is). As Weishaupt himself revealed, The Order of the Illuminati a ppears as an accessory to Free Masonry. It is in the Lodges of Free Masonry that the Minervals are found, and there they are prepared for Illumination. They must have previously obtained the three English [i.e., the"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 587 'Blue'] Degrees' 47 . The penetration method is especially relied upon, in accordance with Weishaupt's Jesuit background, to secure control over the levers of power - the preferred method being to place evil personalities and operativ es with serious blemishes, who are in bondage to vice and corruption, who have stolen money, whose private life is notoriously a mess and, most of all, who indulge in the vice of paedophilia. A disturbingly sizeable proporti on of legislators, rulers, Prime Ministers, Presidents and other holders of high office are gripped by this heinous Illuminati vice - which is am ong the very worst that the Evil One has devised. This phenomenon is easily explained in a spiritual context, given that the human body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and that little children are innocent and by definition unviolated. Since, as Jesus made explicitly clear, forgiv eness is normally unattainable for those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, those hold ers of high office and others who practice paedophilia, perversion and corruption of children are, by definition, beyond forgiveness. Such people, who have almost always themselves been abused in childhood by relatives, but have failed to assert control over their gene rational vice, are destined for perdition - and probably know it. Their unending despair at their own condition may drive them to ever more heinous behaviour. Given the disproportionately large number of such people holding positions at the highest levels of Government these days, it is hardly surprising that the despairing leaders of the Government s concerned are behaving irrationally and with increasing barbarity, while posing as messengers and implementers of 'democracy' - for instance, in Iraq. For the Illuminati, 'democracy' and 'freedom' are no more than empty slogans which mask the underlying evil intent that 'democracy' must be controlled (by vote-rigging, electronic voting scams and 'false-flag' politi cal gamesmanship), while 'freedom' is to be provisional, legally delineated, and arbitrarily controlled in accordance with the demands and requirements of the flluminati's elite and their handlers. GEORGE TENET THANKS 'SPECIAL PERSON' DAVID L BOREN To revert to the Boren case, the occultically-named 'The Texas Triangle' [14th July 1993, pages 1 and 11] cited a 'Queer Nation activist', Michael Petrelis, who had started publicly to accuse Boren of sexually harassing his male staffers. With a startling lack of ambiguity, W. Scott Thompson wrote that Boren had been referred to implicitly in a book called 'Queer in America' [Random House, New York, 1993, pages 170-182] by a certain Mr Michelangelo Signorile. Michael Wright elaborated in an analysis dated August 2003 that 'with these words, Thompson was allegedly hinting strongly that Boren is guilty of sexually harassing male Senate staff members'. Wright's analysis elaborated that when Ge orge Tenet was sworn in as Director of Central Intelligence in 1967, he used the o ccasion to thank some very 'special' people, including Boren, whom he described as 'my friend and mentor for whom I have the highest personal regard and affection and without whom I would not be here today' - remarks that were posted on the CIA website. Writing in 'The Washington Post', Dan Balz and Bob Woodward provided a now famous account of the notorious leisurely breakfast that Tenet and Boren were enjoying on the morning of 9/11. Time' likewise reported that Boren and Tenet were having a 'leisurely breakfast' in a Washington Hotel on the morning of the 9/11 attack. Wright added that 'in January 2001, Boren had called Bush and persuaded him to keep Tenet as CIA Director'. 'USA Today' also de scribed Boren as 'Tenet's patron as he rose to the top of the intelligence community'. At the breakfast, Tenet had said to Boren,"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"588 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich following news of the first aircraft crash: 'I wonder if it has anything to do with this guy taking pilot training'. But not mentioned by Balz and Woodward was the fact that Massaoui' (the terrorist in question) 'who had been much on Tenet's mind, had spent several months in Boren 's own community at Norman, Oklahoma, where he had attended the Airman Flight School for three months in the spring of 2001'. In a complex and meticulous analysis, Mi chael Wright demonstrated that Boren allegedly an operative, allegedly interfaced with, and may have supervised preparations involving, the following 'Jihad' terrorists who spent time in Oklahoma, Boren's State: # Two 9/11 hijackers, Mohammed Atta and Marwana al-Shehhi, who toured the Airman Flight School at the local Westheimer Airport in July 2000. Mohammed Atta and another man thought to be Al -Shehhi met Zacarias Moussaoui (a.k.a. Shaqil, a.k.a. Abu Khalid ad-Sahrawi) in an Oklahoma City motel in August 2001. # Moussaoui, reported by French intelligence to be a high-ranking member of Al- Qaeda, was in Norman, OK, from February to Augu st 2001. He was enrolled in the Airman flight School until May, and lived for part of the time in Oklahoma University housing. # The Wall Street Journal reported that Moussaoui had persuaded the Oklahoma University engineering student Hussein Al-Attas to join the Jihad' in Chechnya, where the Soviets train terrorists clandestinely Al-Attas drove Moussaoui from Norman to Minneapolis to attend another flight school, and Al-Attas subsequently admitted that he was aware of Moussaoui's 'Jihad' activities. # Two 9/11 hijackers listed home addresses in Tulsa, OK. Specifically, Fayez Ahmad gave his home address as the Spartan School of Aeronautics, while Mohammad Al- Ghamdi listed his home address as an apartment comp lex in Tulsa. # The 9/11 hijacker Nawaf AI-Hamzi visited the Oklahoma Al-Qaeda cell in April 2001 and was cited for speeding on Route 1-40. He also attended an Al-Qaeda meeting held in Malaysia in January 2000. # An unidentified Al-Qaeda member or collaborator bought an airline ticket for one of the 9/11 hijackers on a public computer terminal at the Oklahoma University Library. Mr Wright's analysis concluded as follows: 'While in Norman, Moussaou i was receiving funds from Ramzi bin Al-Shibh, a key member of the Al-Qaeda cell in Germany' [source: Rohan Gunaratna, 'Inside Al-Qaeda: Global Network of Terror', Columbia, New Yo rk]. In September 2001, Wright had written, in an Internet posting, that former Senator David Boren's 'close tie to the CIA is well known. He was appointed to the Intelligence Committee in 1985, and later became its Chairman. Boren also has close ties to the extreme right Political Research Associates (PRA), a group whose purpose is to expose the threat to democracy presented by extreme right-wing groups, includes Boren as a member of one of the organizations which they have targeted for concern'.

David Boren was an enthusiastic supporter of Gates and helped push through his nomination as CIA Director'. Hence Boren was the 'mentor' of TWO operatives who became Director of Central Intelligence - Robert Gates and George Tenet. This surely provides ample evidence of Bonesman Boren's exceptional continuing importance - to the German Illuminati Fifth Column operating deep within the corrupted US intelligence structures. Exaggerating the strength and malevolent intentions of the Soviets was of course merely an extension of that same strategic deception ploy that General Reinhard Gehlen used to deceive the American s during the years immediatel y following the Second World War - yet another indication that there has never been any discontinuity of German deception strategy towards the US co mponent of the dual 'Main Enemy'. 'In a speech available online at the CIA we bsite, Gates boasted about CIA success in Afghanistan, where it supported the anti-Soviet Mujahhedin. He admits that the CIA funnelled billions of dollars in supplies and weapons to the Mujahhedin'. Oddly enough, he forgot to mention the notoriously damning fact that that Osama Bin Laden was the CIA's controlled asset and operative whose alias was 'Tim Osman'. The Author concludes that the 9/11 mass murder cover-up operation was orchestrated in secret collaboration with French and Ge rman 'Black' intelligence using DVD-sponsored Al-Qaeda cells, by highly-positioned, blackmailable homosexual Fifth Column Illuminati 'Nazis' buried inside the United States' structur es, where their true loyalties were masked by a convincing veneer of 'loyalism' and the 'pub lic service' ethic. This view is also held (independently of this Author's input) by 'white hat' sectors of Br itish intelligence, whose influence has increased marked ly since the atrocities committed against British citizens and installations in 2005, were traced promptly to Al-Qaeda cells controlled by French and German 'Black' intelligence. Although, in the circumstances, this came as no surprise to the intelligence investigator s concerned, what was new was that certain of their number were finally prepared, out of frustration, to leak such findings to exposure professionals such as the Author of the present work. 'ABLE DANGER' - CODENAME FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY 9/11 PROVOCATION The informed US source mentioned on page 584 implied that the US authorities were responsible for the murder of around 3,000 people on 9/11. The source independently asserted that the primary figures allegedly implicated were Boren and Tenet: Author: 'We haven't discussed 9/11'.

Hitler embarked upon pre-emptive attacks against peaceful countries, justifying his behaviour on the basis that such attacks would make his country more secure - just as George Bush Jr. has done. Similar developments are evolving in the United Kingdom, where the Metropolitan Police have adopted the Is raeli 'shoot to kill' policy and, on 24th July 2005, openly acknowledged that innocent people would die as a consequence, because the danger of mass deaths was greater than the accidental deaths of a few innocents. The press failed to point out that the underlying principl e here was enunciated by Weishaupt on behalf of the Illuminati over two centuries ago: The end justifies the means'. BRITAIN COULD NEVER PARTICIPATE IN EMU ANYWAY Some Germans have been unable to contain thei r pleasure at the sight of the enemies of which they have always been so jealous, in the plight that they are in today. This is what a spokesman for the 'New Europe', emailing w ith foul language from Germany, saw fit to write in September 2004 to a British website specialising in highlighting the destructive and adverse consequences of Britain's failure to understand that 'Fur uns der Krieg ist niemals vorbei' means what it says: 'You seem to be **** scared [sic] of German expansion. Unfortunately I have to tell you that expansio n cannot be stopped. And soon you British will have to pay with Euros and in a few years English will be abolished and you will be forced to speak Germanic. I will not shed a tear for y ou lot'. And the senior figure who sent this email signed off with a reference to Church ill: 'With blood, sweat and tears'. The curious feature of this venomous mini-tirade is that Britain cannot, in fact, participate in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) for many reasons, the most important of which is that the City of London is the seat of the International Petroleum Exchange, which of course trades exclusively in US dollars. This is because the US dollar system is based upon the oil (and drugs) standard which was cemented into place in collaboration with the Saudi Arabian Royal Family in the early 1970s. In any political collective, all dimensions of existence must logically be collectivised, since if areas that are 'uncollectivised' persist, they will challenge and 'degrade' (in the eyes of the controllers of the collective) the overall integrity of the collective itself. It is therefore an 'impossibility' for Britain to be integrated further into the European Union's structures - which means that it has finally been realised, in the Foreign Office and in parts of the intelligence services,"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 591 Figure 92: The front cover of 'E uropaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft' ['European Economic Community'], a compendium of lectures by senior Nazis given at a sy mposium in 1941, and published in book format in 1942 by Haude & Spenersche Verlagsbuchhandlung Max Paschke, Berlin.

It is pathetic that such patchy official understanding has emerged four decades after the United Kingdom was betrayed by Abwehr agents, and that this betrayal was hushed up by the intelligence services themselves - a policy to which the entire Civil Service has consistently adhered. The apparent policy of al lowing traitors to do their dirty work and only revealing the proportion of their treachery after their deaths, bord ers on the treacherous itself. One reason for its application in the case of German long-range strategy is that the Conservative Party has always contained a pro-Ge rmen element, traceable back to the likes of Captain Macnamara. It is this traitor element that has sustained the party's disastrous stance over Britain's participation in the European Union which, as has been shown, is a long-range strategic deception and entrapment operation of the Abwehr and its successor 'Black' intelligence agency, Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, based at Dachau. The outline plans for this corrupt and corrupting supragov-ernmental edifice were laid out in a Nazi compendium published in Berlin in 1942. 'EUROPAISCHE WIRTS CHAFTSGEMEINSCHAFT' That the European Union is indeed a long-range DVD deception strategy was exposed by this Author in 1993, in an Occasional Pa per published with International Currency Review 48 in which the contents of a compendium of lectures arising from a high-level Nazi seminar held in Berlin in 1941 were examined in relation to the subject-headings of the EU's Maastricht Treaty of 1992 - and were found to be almost identical. The lectures were published by Hauder & Spenersche Verlags buchhandlung Max Pashke, Berlin, in 1942 under the title 'Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinsch aft' ('European Economic Community'). Figure 92 on page 591 displays the front page of the copy lodged with the (Preussische) Staatsbibliothek in Berlin. Another copy exists in the British Library, London. The compendium was issued by the Association of Berlin Business People and Industrialists [Der Industrie und Handelskammer zu Berlin] in collaboration with the Berlin School of Economics [Wirtschafts-Hochschule Berlin]. 'Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft' cont ains a 1942 Nazi Party blueprint of the European Community which is indeed almost identical to the structure of the European Economic Community, now the so-called European Union. This became apparent when the Author translated certain selected passages, and the Index, of this document, having tracked it down in the Reading Room of the British Library. The resulting English translation of the Table of Contents, displayed in Figure 93 on page 593, is given on pages 595-597. It confirms that the Nazis planned the establishment of a European Economic Community - complete with a common agricultural policy, a common exchange rate system and monetary policy, common industrial and trade policies, trans-European networks, and a powerful European Central Bank dominated by Germany. When in 1993, the Author made this straightforward and easily verifiable information widely available, including to the dumkopfs in the London-based media, no-one took any notice. Reasons for this include the fact that both main British political parries rely on 'payola' corruption and on drug-money flows laundered via 'benefactors' through offshore accounts for their survival, in accordance with the standard EU-DVD methodology, while the national newspapers have geopolitical and/ or Illuminati axes to grind. For instance, certain newspapers, while ostensibly affecting wa ll-to-wall British patriotism, have historically belonged to the treacherous wing of the Cons ervative Party which has German affiliations.

He had deduced that Hitler was organising his conquests into the United States of Europe as early as 1941. The pre- dominantly industrial Reich had been enlarg ed by the annexation of The Netherlands, Luxembourg, parts of Belgium, Alsace Lorraine, Northern France as far as the Somme, and Western Poland. To feed this industrial heartland, food was to be conveyed from the outer periphery of Europe, which was mainly agricu ltural. All European production was to be regulated in minute detail from Berlin, from wh ere Soviet-style central planning was to be directed; and all trade was to be controlled by means of a regional multilateral clearing system which Germany had already established among about a dozen states. But the system was fragile, since not all the annexed states were compliant; while its greatest weakness was a lack of raw materials. At the Congress of Europe held in Rome between 14th and 20th November 1932, the Nazi Alfred Rosenberg had outlined ideas for th e economic restructuring of Europe. These ideas were heavily promoted under the Nazis by the newspaper 'Die Deutsche Volkswirtschaft' ['The German People's Eco nomy'], which campaigned for what one of the contributors to the compendium, Professor Dr Heinrich Hunke, called 'the concept of the German economy becoming self-sufficient in a new political sense'. Another influential advocate of a 'New Europe' reorganised eco nomically and politically to meet the 'requirements' of the German Reich, was a German Ambassador, Daitz, whose selected speeches and essays were published in 1938 under the giveaway title Veutschland und die Europaische Grossraumwirtschaft' ['Germany and the Greater European Economy']. Close attention was also paid by the Nazi leadership and by the Reich's planners to a speech by the prominent leader of the powerful German agricultural community, R. Walther Darre, in the course of a seminar held at Munich in January 1939 on the following subject: 'Market organisation of National Socia list agricultural policy as a pacemaker for a new foreign trade organisation'. So much, then, for the widespread belief that the market- rigging Common Agricultural Policy of today is a 'French ramp'. Paris knows, but conveniently keeps up its sleeve, that the socialist organisation of agriculture in Europe was first proposed by the Nazis. Addressing the Bertelsmann Forum on 3rd April 1992, former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl confirmed that the German Government was openly promoting the estab- lishment of a United States of Europe. Dr Kohl said: 'At Maastricht we laid the foundation stone for the completion of the European Union. The European Union Treaty introduces a new and decisive stage in the process of Eu ropean union which within a few years will lead to the creation of what the founding fathers of modern Europe dreamed of following the last war: The United States of Europe'. Given the behaviour of his country during that war, Dr Kohl was perhaps under- standably economical with the truth on that o ccasion. For it was not the 'founding fathers of modern Europe', meaning the post-war politi cians, who developed the scheme and who first attempted to establish a United States of Europe. It was Nazi Germany, and its pan- German predecessors, working behind th e deep cover of the German-spawned Illuminati. This is perfectly clear from the Na zi book 'Europaische Wi rtschaftsgemeinschaft'. In order to prove that 'Europaische Wirtschafts gemeinschaft''contains the precise blueprint of the European Community project as confirmed by the convoluted Maastricht Treaty and its successor variants, it is unfort unately necessary to reproduce so me of the Nazi thinking and rhetoric contained in this document.

Even the British Prim e Minister's staff described the Treaty text as 'a can of worms' - on the basis of which remark, the Author commissioned the cartoon shown below. The main headings of the Maastricht Treaty - whic h has been updated every four years or so since - a cynical Talmudic technique which procures that what was collectively imposed at the pre ceding Intergovernmental Conference is liable to be superseded at any time - conform predsely with those of the Nazi compendium dating from 194 2 entitled 'Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft', meaning European Economic Community, reviewed in these pages. Notwithstanding this easily acces sible evidence that the EU is modelled on the Nazi blueprint, bribery and corruption prevailed. ■ 'If you open up this can of worms everything comes out': a Downing Street official on the Maastricht Treaty, 10.2.1993."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"598 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich BRITAIN STOOD IN THE WAY According to Professor Dr Heinrich Hunke, Great Britain and its European economic hegemony stood in the way of the promotion of European economic and political un- ification. 'The route and extent of Europ ean economic unity', he insisted, 'remained problematical, as long as it was possible for the Fuhrer to hope that he might be able to follow the path of peaceful conciliation with England'. And he added triumphantly that, after the events of 193940, this option was finally excluded. The Nazis understood that the project of 'Europaische Grossraumwirtschaft' would be unattainable while 'the Anglo-Saxon economic system' remained in tact. Thus Professor Hunke, one of the Hitler regime's leading economists, writes in the compendium of 1942: '...Europe may not be... a market [area] in terms of a reduced world economy, in which... the old structural laws of the Angl o-Saxon world economy apply, but [rather] the European Economic Community must be shap ed in accordance with the new political categories and will consequently appear different from the economy of the pasf. As for the meaning of 'Grossraumwirtschaft', this was identical with that of the familiar slogan 'Lebensraum', which Hunke he lpfully described in the following passage: 'By its Lebensraum Germany means: (1) Sufficient space [for Germany] to be able to live and grow in an enclosed settlement in Europe. ['Europaische Grossraumwirtschaft' would not look outwards]. (2) The remodelling of the German econ omy along centralised state lines. (3) Acknowledgment of the development of a Continental European Economic Community, permitting both the utilisation of domestic economic powers [and] fur- thermore ensuring that the economic capacity of friendly neighbouring states is mutually complementary and accessible [by Germany] in time of need; and: (4) The development of a colonial economic supplementary area, as is customary and possible elsewhere in the world'. The Nazi treatise is held together by a peroration attributed to the same Professor Dr Heinrich Hunke, Chairman of the German Economic Promotion Council in 1942, who appears to have had the task of summarising the papers. From this section, two passages are worth noting: 'At the turn of the year 1939 -40, the main part of Europe was still under the spell of the English concept of economic organisation, whether Europe was aware of this fact or not. But in the course of recent years, this concept has been swept out of the Continental European countries in political, military and economic terms. In political terms [Europe has been reorgani sed with] every people and every area... living together as neighbours according to the ideals of a new peoples' order. In military terms, the foundation of English economic practice, the doctrine of the balance of power, has been utterly overturned. And in ec onomic terms, as a result of the political and military developments, a revolution has been initiated.... The transformation taking place in our presence must be placed alongside the greatest economic revolutions in history ... signifying fundamentally a turning-back by European economies to the time prior to the formation of the English Overseas Europe'. 'Much is owed to the newspaper 'Die De utsche Volkswirtschaft' for having initially taken up these questions at the Congress of Eu rope [held] in Rome between 14th and 20th November 1932], for having put the argume nts again and again, and for having main- tained... with dogged persistence... the concept of the German economy becoming self- sufficient in a new political sense'. So Mazzini's Political Action Centre in the Vatican turns out to have been the guiding hand be hind 'Europaische Wirt schaftsgemeinschaft'."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 599 A NAZI EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY These and innumerable other documented references confirm the direct lineage of the European Union Collective from Nazi Germany. It is nothing less than a classic long-range strategic deception operation - controlled fr om Dachau. When considered against the background of the contemporaneous deep-cover Nazi Continuum offensive against the United States, we have a classic 'scissors' dual strategic deception. At the conclusion of 'Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft', Professor Hunke drew together the themes set out in the book by Reichswirtschaftsminister und President der Deutschen Reichsbank, Walther Funk, who expostulated on 'The economic character of the New Europe'; by Dr Horst Jecht, from the Berlin School of Economics, who anticipated the development of the new 'European Economic Community'; by Dr Emil Woermann, a Professor from the University of Halle, who described 'The New European Agricultural Order'; by Dr Anton Reithinger, from I. G. Farben. Berlin, who spoke about 'The New European Industrial Economy'; by Dr Philipp Beisiegel, Director of the Reich Ministry of Labour, who gave details of 'The New Labour Order', with emphasis on the rigging of labour markets, the movement of workers in accordance with inter-state agreements, and the direction of labour; by Gustav Koenigs, a State Secretary, whose paper discussed 'European Traffic Questions' - the Nazi blueprint for the EU's so-called 'Trans-European Networks'; by Dr Bernhard Benning, the Director of the Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft A.G., Berlin, who discussed 'European Currency Questions', including: The harmonisation of European rates of exchange', 'The future form of the European Currency System' ['Die Zukunft des europaishes Wahrungssystems'], and 'The European Currency Bloc' - all collectivist concepts which became familiar in the early 1990s; and by Dr Carl Clodius, the Manager of the Foreign Trade Centre based in Berlin, who described 'European Trading and Economic Agreements', touching upon: 'Principles of European Cooperation', 'The European Regional Principle' (the precursor of the EU's Common Regional Policy), 'Internal requirements of the European Economic Community', and finally 'Methods of European Cooperation'. With the single exception of the chapter on the Common Labour Policy, with its emphasis on the direction of labour, all of these chapter and section headings would be entirely fam iliar to followers of European Community intrigue and politics today. THE NEW EUROPE PLANNED BY THE NAZIS The Nazi Professor Dr. Hunke philosophised thus: 'The ultimate manifestation of the European Economic Community would be as follows: Initially the utilisation of the productive powers of the peoples will initiate a general change in what is produced in terms of its expansion. No longer will there be only that produced which the world market price permits and offers, but that which the forces of the people and of the area make possible. It might very well be possible to say that freedom of labour replaces freedom of the economy. In practical terms, this then means the end of the national mono-cultures, to the extent that they have been determined by price. There is no sense in putting together all European countries by means of a Customs Union just in order to reconstruct for practical purposes a reduced form of the English world economy with precisely the same faults. Customs Unions are the means of eliminating excessive difficulties between two peoples' economies of the same level, and in such cases are necessary. However, any elimination of all Customs restrictions in present-day Europe overnight would only disturb and endanger unnecessarily the natural growing together of the European peoples' economies' (i.e., this Utopian collectivism cannot actually work)."},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"600 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich 'Secondly, the aim of future economic coope ration is community of living space, i.e. it should not be the task of the new economic policy to destroy mono-cultures only to replace them by impossible insularities. For example, the German Empire has in recent years redirected its economic focus back towards the state sector by means of a considerable degree of self-sufficiency, because this was the political prerequisite for the economic independence of Europe.... In 1932 [at the Rome Congress] Sering correctly pointed out that the power of the American economy would collapse on the day that high Customs barriers were erected at the borders of each of the 48 States of the North American union, as is the case in Europe. But the European States would run the risk of becoming economically overwhelmed and losing their political independence if trade barriers were removed all at once, unless one day a new organic association were to replace the economic impoverishment of the individual States'. 'In this European Economic Community two phenomena will be fundamentally new: full employment and the coverage of essential goods from within the domestic area'. [Author's Unavoidable Note: Experience, as predicted in articles by this Author, Peter Jay and others, has of course demonstrated that these predictions were 100% incorrect].'There can be no doubt that the experiences of the German people of having reached the stage of full employment from their own resources or on the basis of new economic awareness, will provide the other peoples with the means for better employment, and the execution of European tasks made necessary by the development of large portions of the Continent will at the same time employ resources to an extent imagined by only a few people today. In this way the European peoples will... free themselves from the condition of a proletariat wit hout rights, and will build for themselves a new life'. In the even t, the European Union experiment has been associated with sky-high unemployment and economic stagnation - demonstrating that Nazi economics was make-believe, as Third World countries encumbered with the formulae preached by the German Chicago School have discovered. 'Exactly the same economic political impe rative will require that goods which are essential must also always be attainable; for what could the true meaning of the term Lebensraum be other than that of access at any time to essential goods.... It is accordingly clear that the European Economic Community will initiate an entirely new epoch for Europe. But it is just as evident that the practical implementation of the new principles will have to overcome many hindrances... [especially] difficulties which lie in the minds of Europeans, and not in the world of goods'. 'For example, I recall the problem of the clearing surplu ses. One can understand why today there are still people who regard the clear ing surpluses with considerable mistrust... What I have stated here in regard to th e problem of the clearing surpluses applies fundamentally as regards all phenomena in the New Europe. The importance of German economic power is the prerequisite for the game which has now commenced, for all housekeeping is a form of compensation. But only that person who has the appropriate facilities can balance the books. Over and above this, reorientation of one's way of thinking, and familiarity with the new world of [European] ideas, is the necessary prerequisite for the further implementation and development of the European Economic Community...'. Making maximum use of the Le ninist jargon word common, used by Communists and Nazis alike. Professor Hunke concluded: 'So let us not be diverted from initiating the Lebensraum Community by the small hindrances along the way. And as we progress along the path towards the New Europe, we find that we have reached the following unusual position. Common need enabled us"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 601 to recognise common European problems. From the Congress of Europe [Rome, 1932], which took place at the invitation of the Ital ian Academy in November 1932 at Rome, to deal with the issue of the 'E uropean Crisis' and to consider the question of Europe's spiritual unity, the economic division of power and Continental cultural issues, up to the Anti-Comintern Pact held in Berlin in the autumn of last year - what a powerful imple- mentation of the biological resources of Europe in a struggle to maintain our European culture and the European peoples these occasions were! There can be no doubt that ulti- mately no people on the European Continent will be able permanently to refrain from the decision being fought about today'. Note that the Italian Academy fronted for the Political Action Centre, as sponsor of the little-remembered but crucial Congress of Europe. 'But what is more important is that common need not only permitted the recognition of common problems, but allowed above all like-minded spiritual and political movements to be created in the most different countries of Europe... In the meantime, the most important countries have also given a new image to the State...'. 'Harmony goes so far that today the single-party in contrast to the old multi-party system may be regarded as typical of the new political form in Europe. A similar unity is revealed in the field of economic direction. Not surprisingly, in this state of collapse, in the common emergency, in pursuing our common defence, we recall also more and more our common past. Thus the common cultural foundation will grow slowly into a new European consciousness'. 'However, the decisive event on the path towards a new future for our old Continent will be common work [a.k.a. a Fascist form of collectivism].... I believe... that... the common future work of the European nations... will like nothing else promote and structure the European Economic Community. Much of what European people once created overseas has been lost, never to be recovered. That which fa te has left to us, our homeland, our family and our place of work, we are now defending on the C ontinent. It is now up to us, whether we again construct a New World from the European spirit and from common European blood and thereby ensure for ourselves a new life and a new prosperity. The outlines of this new world are in front of us within our reach. Whether we succeed in building the New Europe ourselves is up to us; it depends upon our will, our development of resources and our use of resources'. INTERVIEW WITH AN O.N.I. OPERATIVE IN CANADA In May 2003, the Author interviewed a US Of fice of Naval Intelligence (ONI) operative in Canada, at his suggestion, to discuss various dimensions of what the Author had published in 'International Currency Review', Volume 28, Number 4, issued in March 2003 49 , in which aspects of the subversion of the United States by corrupt, penetrated US intelligence cadres with their own agendas aligned to foreign powers driven by their Illuminati obsessions, were reviewed. In the course of this interview, the operative confirmed (paraphrased) that factional warfare within the vast intelligence community 'has been going on for a lot longer than I have been alive. It started with Germany, and the penetration by German Nazi intelligence which has been perpetuated by the children of the original Nazis brought to the United States. The main troubles in the world today are caused by these Nazis and their operations. Their activities are directly related to the world's troubles toda y'. The US operative, moreover, had no qualms in pointing the finger at George Bush Sr, whom he insisted 'IS THE GOVERNMENT'. He is directing strategy. He told and tells Bill and Hilla ry, George Bush Jr. and Cheney what to do'."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"602 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich When the Author asked a question to the fo llowing effect - 'how far do these peo-ple intend to go with their programme to establi sh the Thousand-Year Reich on the ruins of the United States?' - the ONI operative told him: 'All the way'. And he then drew attention to the specia l trains which were being constructed % move people out of the way who are going to give them a hard time'. At that stage, the Author had only heard about these US 'death trains' from various 'underground' sources and was exercising his journalistic right and duty to be sceptical. Were these trains associated with the network of concentration camps that has been established in North America [seepages 612-613], he asked. The answer was: 'Absolutely'. 'The Author also asked for and obtained, hard confirmation of the revelation that the Amtrak 'repair' facility in Indianapolis, which will 'take out' 26,000 religious and political prisoners arrested under Martial Law every 24 hours, had been converted to a gas extermination depot According to persistent reports, Amtrak containers with ceiling fittings have been designed to be connected to gas pipes so that a gas comparable to Zyklon-B can be administered to those held in the container trucks, ready for transportation to disposal areas. This was the technique used by the Nazis in Hungary, Latv ia and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Opponents were shot inside a special train, which stopped to pick up victims in the same way that a normal train picks up passengers. The victims were disposed of inside the train trucks and conveyed by the train for di sposal - so that, when the death trains moved on, traces of the mass murders were not left at 'liquidation' scenes. CONFIRMATION OF THE AMTRAK DEATH FACILITY Al Cuppett, at the Pentagon, is reported to have been among those who have confirmed the existence and purpose of this industrialised death 'facility'. He is stated to have confirmed that 'it is a gassing/crematory facility where large former 'repair barns' can hold four prisoner boxcars at a time, while deadly toxic gas is released into the barn and the boxcars'. Some of these boxcars contain, according to several eyewitness reports, guillotines imported from Japan and China installed in th em. They all have shackles installed for the retention of prisoners, as separately confirmed to this Author by the Office of Naval Intelligence source. One type of container, imported from China, is 40 feet long, equipped with shackles and a modern guillotine at the front end. For all practical purposes, the boxcars appear to be 'normal' Chinese trade cargo co ntainers marked HANJIN, COSCO etc that can be piggybacked on train flatbeds or trucks. A ccording to one report, 20,000 of these boxcars were ordered under secret contract from China. The model for these Amtrak gas containers was described by Gertrude Schneider, who was deported on 6th February 1942 from Vienna , cited by Dr Martin Gilbert in 'The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy '[Fontana Pr ess/HarperCollins Publis hers, London, 1987]. Dr Gilbert explained that 'the Viennese tr ansport reached Riga on February 10. It was met at the station by Dr Rudolph Lange, one of the Jewish Nazi officials who had been present at the Wannsee Conference' fwhere the definitive arrangements were made for the 'Final Solution' under Adolf Eichmann]. Gertrude Schneider later recalled how Lange told these latest arrivals that those who we re 'unwilling or unable' to walk the seven kilometres to the ghetto could make the jo urney on trucks which had been especially reserved for them. 'In this way', he said, 't hose of you who ride can prepare a place for those who walk'. Gertrude Schneider's graphi c account continued: '\"It was an extremely cold day - forty-two degrees below zero, to be exact - and so the majority of the hapless, unsuspecting Jews from Vienna took his advice and lined up to board"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 603 the trucks. They did not know that those greyish-blue trucks had been manufactured at the Saurer Works in Austria especially for the implementation of the 'Final Solution'. These trucks were the gas-vans, which were used fro m time to time despite the fact that the SS did not especially like them because th ey always had mechanical problems' 50 . The 800+ prison or concentration camps in the United States today are all fully or prospectively operational, and re ady to receive prisoners. By la te 2005, there were reports of large numbers of (deliberately) displaced Blac ks from the New Orleans area being held in prison camps, while the Amtrak Station in the city was still, as late as June 2006, being used as a prison. According to reports, the camps were to be operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, financed initially by Illuminati drug money) and since subsumed within the Department of Homeland Security (a.k.a. the Ministry of State Security) should Martial Law need to be implemented. All that would be necessary would be a Presidential signature on a proclamation, and the US Attorney General's signature on a warrant, to which a list of names would be attached. Associated or integrated with the US concentration camp and prospective 'death train' infrastructure is the previously mentioned 'Rex-84' program, which uses the name of the highest 'Degree' of the Illuminati (see Figure 78, page 497). The rationale for the establishment of this programme, for public consumption purposes, was reportedly that if a 'mass exodus' of illegal aliens were to cross the Mexican/US border, they would be r ounded up and detained in 'Rex-84' detention centres by FEMA. It was under the 'Rex-84' Program that many US domestic military bases were closed down with the so-called 'end of the Cold War' and turned into prisons or concentration camp 'facilities'. MORE ABOUT THE AMERICAN DEATH CAMP BOXCARS The US Nazis are certainly 'on top of prepar ations for the confirmation of the Fourth Reich. The equivalent of the Saurer Works in Nazi Austria is Gunderson Steel Fabrication of Portland, Oregon, which is assisted by other boxcar and associated manufacturing companies around the United States. Gunderson, working with Bethlehem Steel, obtained a contract to build 107,200 full-length railroad boxcars, each with 143 pairs of shackles. A total of 11 contractors were reported in 2005 to be involved in the manufacture of these death boxcars. It was also reported in 2005 that mobile prison units had been seen on train flatbeds in Georgia. According to Michael Maholy, allegedly a veteran of 20 years in the CIA and the Office of Naval Intelligence, and as confirme d independently by the alleged former CIA assassin, Elaine Knost, the Nazi-Illuminati establishment has a clear idea of who 'the enemy' from their perspective is to be. 'Oh, all of us in the intelligence community know about the concentration camps and their purposes. We all know that they are to terminate the resisters to the New World Order under Martial Law'. The existence of the concentration camps a nd death train complex, and their purpose, was separately confirmed to a US intelligence contact of the Author's by General Alexander Haig. And during this Author's interview in May 2003 with the Office of Naval Intelligence operative, the death trains were independently described as providing 'standing room only.... Shackles out of the ceiling... Same pr inciple as Hitler's trains'. The operative referred to a military intelligence officer, know n to the Author and colleagues by name, who has 'actually been on the trains'. He added that a train tunnel has already been constructed beneath the Bering Strait, and that prisoners able to work 'will be' exported in such boxcars under the Strait to work in covert Soviet labour"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"604 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich camps - joining up the intended American Nazi GULAG with the continuing Soviet GULAG, details of which are given in Appendix 2 to this Chapter [page 614]. It is usually the case that explanations are concocted for public consumption, in order to 'manage' public perceptions and reaction when a strategic intelligence pro- gramme surfaces into the public domain, as ALWAYS happens in the end, since 'nothing is hid, that shall not be known' 51 . This routine practice may explain the surfacing of information about the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel and Railroad Group, reports of which suggest that this is a project for th e future - whereas the intelligence operative interviewed by the Author in May 2003 specif ically indicated that the tunnel had been completed and was in use; and furthermore, that a veteran known to this Author had actually travelled on the trains and through the tunnel. For public consumption, the Bering Strait Tunnel and Railroad Group is a small, private, non-profit group of individuals from around the world who share the objective of constructing a rail and tunnel line connecting the Western with the Eastern He mispheres, so that the North American rail system is connected with that of Ru ssia. According to public domain information available in 2003, this was to be done by ex tending the existing lines, with the construction of about 4,800 miles of additional track, and building a tunnel across the Bering Strait at Wales, Alaska, and connecting at approximately Uelen, in Russia. 'Resisters' to the 'New World Order' - the 'Order' of the Illuminati which is to be imposed by the 'New World'- include Christians who are Bible believers (such as this Author), Constitutionalists, Patriots, US gun-owners wh o refuse to relinquish their Second Amendment rights, anyone foolish enough to adhere to th e notion of national sovereignty and the US Constitution and who rejects the Luciferian ideal and intended reality of World Government, and all unreformed authors, broadcasters, l ecturers and clergy (pastors) who are not enamoured of the hell that is thereby intend ed. Also targeted of course are those who understand that, since this mad 'Permanent Revolution' is born of corruption, the global control apparat cannot fail to manifest itself as the New Underworld Order - characterised by the overflowing of the filthy, stinking underg round River Styx from Hades up to the surface, where it is swamping the structures of civilised and orderly governance. SINISTER ASSOCIATED REPRESSION PROGRAMMES Two sinister sub-program mes, named Cable Splicer and Garden Plot, will be implemented once the 'Rex-84' Program is initiated for its proper purpose. Cable Splicer provides for the 'orderly' takeover of state and local governments by the Federal Government, while Garden Plot is a programme to control the population, no doubt in part through the unofficial 'privatised' arrangements which were being put in place (as of 2006) such as the new Neighbourhood Watch Association domestic spying system (prop: Marcus Wolf). The concentration and prison camps all have railroad infrastructures as well as roads leading to and from the detention 'facilities', while many also have a local airport nearby -convenient for use by a greatly expanded manifestation of the existing arrange ments for the non-stop transportation of prisoners around the count ry by a fleet of planes operated by J.P.A.T.S.

They include: Executive Orders 10990 (allowing the US Government to take over all modes of transportation); 10995 (a llowing the Government to seize and control the communications media); 10997 (allowing th e Government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals ope rations and resources); 10998 (allowing the US Government to seize all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports and waterways); 10999 (enabling the Government to take over all food resources and farms); 11000 (permitting the Government to mobilise civilians into work brigades under government supervision - that is, Nazi direction of labour); 11001 (allowing the Government to take over all health, education and welfare functions); 11002 (designating th e Postmaster General to operate a national registration index of all persons); 11003 (allow ing the Government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft ); 11004 (allowing the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public fund s, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations, exactly as occurred in New Orleans in 2005); 11005 (allowing the Government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities); 11051 (specifying the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and giving authorisation to put all Executive Orders into effect at times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis); 11310 (granting authority to the Department of Justice to enfo rce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, a nd to advise and assist the President); 11049 (assigning emergency preparedness functions to Federal Departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a 15-year period); and 11921 (allowing the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages and salaries, credit and the flow of money in US financial institutions in any undefined national emergency environment. This Executive Order also provides that when a State of Emergency is declared by the President, the Co ngress cannot review the President's action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, now buried within the Department of Homeland Security, has broad powers in respect of every dimension of national existence. The Chief of FEMA's Civil Security Division, General Frank Salezo, stated at a conference held in 1983 that he saw FEMA's ro le as 'a new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"606 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as the prevention of dis- sident groups from gaining access to US opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis'. FEMA's powers were consolidated by President Jimmy Carter to incorporate (a) the National Security Act of 1947, which, in add ition to covering official criminal oper-ations under a blanket justification of 'national security', allows fo r the strategic reloca-tion of industries, services, Government and other essential economic ac tivities, and to rationalise requirements for manpower, resources and production fa cilities; (b) the Defense Production Act of 1950, which gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy; (c) an Act of 29th August 1916, which authorises the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportati on system for transporting troops, materiel, or any other purpose related to the emergency; and finally: (d) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which enables the Presiden t of the United States to seize the property of a foreign country or national. All these pow ers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979; but it appears that lines of communication 'broke down' during the New Orleans 'Katrina' crisis, which should have been handled by FEMA, as required by these consolidated Acts. As a consequence of the 'Katrina' crisis, land previously the location of Black housing has been acquired by the authorities for clearance and probably oil sector development. The main levee was breached far below the waterline as a consequence of an explosion, heard by local residents at 4.00 am on the morning of the disaster. The land on which Black housing stood may overlay a large oil reservoir, implying for many analysts that this 'emergency' was contrived - as implied later by Vice President Cheney when he made the cynical comment: 'We are on top of this exercise'. THE OUTCOME IS NOT INEVITABLE: FAILURE IS A CERTAINTY In the view of many jaded observers of these developments, the promoters of the New Underworld Order are 'out of the gate' and uns toppable. But there are sound practical reasons for knowing that this resigned attitude is mistaken. In the first place, rival domestic and foreign sectors are competing desperately for control of the New Age of Man - which means that this demented project is certain to fail and collapse: 'A house divided against itself cannot stand' 52 . The furiously competing cadres within the vast US intelligence community are themselves the misguided instruments of European powers which are at loggerheads with each other for the same reason - and for control over the United States. A US intelligence expert adds that 'we underestimate th e Japanese in all of this' - an insight with which the Author readily concurs, given the historical links and similarity between the German and Japanese corporate (Fascist) systems. Secondly, the reality is that 'the Gates of He ll shall not prevail' against the Word of Jesus Christ 53 . These gates are wide open, enticing the unwary in vast numbers to perdition. For that is where they are headed: as Jesus, whose logic was always perfect, warned, 'if the blind lead the blind, BOTH shall fall into the ditch' 54 (an obvious truth). Because they know this, both categories of 'the blind' are riven with hatr ed against those who refuse to go along with them to keep them company. Th e 'seething energies of Lucifer' w ill not leave them alone. 'Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it' 55 . If we chose the narrow way, rejecting Lucifer's enticements, we have the comfort of Christ's eternal promise: 'And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world' 56 ."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 607 From: 'The Price of Loyalty: George W.

Second Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, Chapter 2, ve rse 7: 'For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way'. This is a most significant verse, which few understand. The 'mystery of iniquity' is clearly a reference to the fr equently unfathomable deviousness and subtlety of Satan, his legions of demons working through those he and they control and whom they possess, and his Works of Darkness. It precisely meets our naturally anxious need to grasp what motivates the perpetrators of evil, and why they so often seem to command hegemony. But consider also the second part of P aul's statement: 'only he who now letteth' - Satan who is running wild and 'walking to and for over the earth'* and appears to have little resistance. And look at the words 'already' and 'now' in Paul's statement - meaning, that Satan was 'already', and 'now', since the birth, passion and resurrection of Christ, working overtime with his 'seething ener gies' to destroy and defeat the Word of the Lord and the reality of the living Christ, who is 'the Way, the Truth and the Life'. So what Paul was actually saying here fully supports what Chaim Rakover told his MVD interrogators, as elaborated so beneficially by Dr Henry Mackow. Paul was telling the Thessalonians (and us) that the \"permanent revolution' spok en of by Rackover was already under way. He concluded his statement by assuring us that he (Satan) will 'be taken out of the way'. That is a promise we must never forget; for if we believe, then of course it is manifestly true (something that no-one who does not yet understand how the living Christ \"works'\" in us, cannot understand.

Note in this text, the important and overlooked comma nd that we must not swear by the earth, 'for it is His (God's) footstool'. To the mind of the Author, this provides confirmation of his belief, or rather certainty, that there is no life anywhere in the universe ex cept here on earth, and that it was on earth that the Lord performed his great works. This becomes obvious when one consid ers this statement more clos ely: if the earth is 'the Lord's footstool', then by definit ion Mars, Pluto, Jupite r and numerous moons and planets ar e NOT his footstool - that is to say, the place where the Lord performed all his great works. T he search for life among the planets and in outer space, is a delusion descended from and directly linked to the occult preoccupations of astrologers, magicians, the death-oriented Egyptians, and Babylonian sorcerers. 25.

Yuri Nosenko, a KGB operat ive sent to Washington to neutralise strategic revelati ons by the Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, has described the exec ution of Lavrentii Pavlovich Beria in terms which suggest that he himself was the executioner. Beria was described as begging fo r his life in floods of tears, to no avail. 33. T. H. Tetens, 'Germany Plots with the Kremlin', op. cit., page 9. 34. This is a reference to the devious means by which the German Nazi geopolitical planners managed to contrive a comprehensive US policy U-turn. While President Roosev elt remained alive, the policy in Washington had been to devastate Germany to such an extent that it would never recover industrially. A fter Roosevelt's death, however, a group of Germanophiles, just like Edward Heath, who had lived in Germany before the war, found t hemselves with sufficient influence to procure the reversal of the policy. The group in question was led by George Kennan at the State Department, who exploited the emergence of Stalin's USSR as the 'new' enemy, and promoted the idea of rebuilding Germany as a 'bulwark against the East', a strategy which ignored the secret German policy of orientation towards Russia and the penetration of its intelligence and Party structures by German agents. Kennan influenced President Truman and was also instrumental in procuring the effective abandonment of de-Nazification, thereby facilitating the importation of a cadre of 770 top warfar e scientists who had been working for Himmler in connection with occult mind- and personality control and manipulation techniques, rocke t science, space travel and other programmes. These high- ranking Nazis penetrated the OSS, which became the Central Intelligence Agency, and have been associated with the promotion and exploitation of the occult and with some of the darkest programmes of US intelligence, such as MK- ULTRA. The Nazis are llluminati and their central locus is Dachau, a place which is associated for all eternity with their 'Final Solution' mass murder apparatus. It is little surp rise that the United States, which is today in grave danger of developing into a Nazi-style dictatorship , has constructed a large number of concent ration camps: see Appendix 2 to this Chapter, pages 612-613. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 provided for Congress to strip away the Judiciary's jurisdiction over certain areas of law. The dictatorial l egislation made citizen dissidents subject to arrest as enemy combatants (determined solely by secret military tribunal), allo wing for their indefinite detention, and removing any Habeas Corpus right to demand that the Government must show cause for holding them as a prisoner. So the concentration camps may soon fill up. 35. A reference, obviously, to what became the German Geopolitical Centre, or Nazi International, Madrid. 36.

C ONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF S OVIET AND G ERMAN EXPERTS ON THE GEOPOLITICAL PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL EUROPE : GENEVA , SEPTEMBER 1990 • The Federal Republic of Germany demands [Nazi language - Author] compensation from the USSR for annexed Eastern Prussia and for the area east of the Oder-Niesse. • The Federal Republic of Germany demands the withdrawal of Soviet influence in the Bohemian-Moravian region. The USSR has no intention of tolerating in the vicinity of its borders the Czechoslovak Federal regime, which did not accept the Soviet gesture by means of which Husak's Socialist regime was allowed to fall. The Governme nt of the CSFR persists in its anti-Soviet agitation and is making the position of the Sovi et Government and President difficult. The Governments of Poland and Hungary, by cont rast, behave differently. • The USSR will not impede the division of the CSFR beca use of insufficient guarant ee of political stability in Central Europe, and insufficient state-formation by the nationalities of Czechoslovakia. • The Soviet Union agrees to the eventual incorporation of the Bohemian-Moravian region into the German sphere of economic interests and to the political incorporati on of this region into Germany over 12-15 years. • The Federal Republic of Germany will make [due] compensa tion for the losses this [i.e., such a transfer -Author] causes to the Soviet Union. • In the event of a drop in the popularity of the leaders of the CSFR, the Federal Repub lic of Germany will prepare as an alternative political teams predisposed towards Germany that are at the same time acceptable to the USSR. Members of these alternative political teams [to be set up if necessary in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, if 'cooperation' is not forthcoming from the incumbents there - Ed.] will come from left-leaning parties as well [sic]. The Federal Republic of Germany will do this without visibly affecting the image [Czech: 'profilace'] of the po litical parties concerned [Author: = Intelligence operations]. • With regard to the willingn ess of Hungary to maintain political and economic stability in the Danube region, the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany will not impede the re-establishment of a Hungary within the original borders in accordance with the Trianon Treaty. The Federal Republic of Germany will increase its political assistance to Hungary so that the standard of living in Hungary will be raised above that in Slovakia, so that joining Hungary becomes attractive to Slovaks. • The USSR has no objections to the establishment of a German University and high schools in the Bohemian- Moravian region, or to the funding by Germany of these schools. • The USSR has no objections to the division of Yugoslavia. It agrees to the shifting of Croatia and Slovenia to the economic sphere of the Federal Republic of Germany. • The Soviet Union has no objections to the use of vehicles of political destabilisation. • The Federal Republic of Germany will not involve itself in the questions of the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and will not consider these to be areas of economic interest beyond an acceptable level. • The USSR will not impede the separation of the Transcarpathian Ukraine in the event of destabilising activity on the part of Ukrainian nationalists and thei r incorporation into the Hungarian Republic. • The USSR has no objections to the gradual colonisation of the Czech bord er regions by Soviets and Germans. This text was faxed to the offices of 'P olitika'. Having interviewed the Editor at his house outside Prague, a contact of the Author was certain that this document was indeed simply fa xed to the paper, which proceed ed at once to reproduce it. A close examination of the structure of the sentences and language by a Czech language expert in Prague revealed that the text is unlikely to have been translated into Czech from the Russian. On the contrary, it was originally written in German. This is apparent not least from the opening German 'demands'. Another reason for this conclusion is the use of the Czech word 'profilace', for which no comparable word, in either Russian or English, exists. However the German word 'profilierung' - image - is appropriate in the context. 'P olitika' was, at the time of the article's publicatioa a well-known, controversial, sm all weekly paper selling several thousand copies , available on central Prague newsstands, and widely read by officials and the intelligentsia. The accord provides further evidence of German hegemony ambitions - directed by Deutsche Verteidig ungs Dienst from Dachau. ■"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"612 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich APPENDIX 2 TO CHAPTER 8: THE NORTH AMERICAN ILLUMINATI GULAG CAMP SYSTEM The following directory of the North American Na zi-style concentration camp system has been compiled from open domain sources, but is based upon 'Humint' observation and is incomplete.

CONTINUING GULAGS AROUND THE WORLD The world appears to be almost wholly indifferent to the existence of GULAGs. There has been considerable international shock at the discovery, following the attack in Iraq in 2003, that the United States has erected a system of Guantanamo-style concentration camps around the world, and that the amoral and cowardly US authorities routinely fly people they arrest without trial, to countries where torture is permitted (formally, it is not legal in the United Stat es, although it does take place). This now notorious CIA abomination is called 'Extraordinary Rendition'. When the Author published detailed informat ion about the continuing and expanding Soviet GULAG under the fake 'non'-Communist regime of Boris Yeltsin, complete with street addresses of the camps and other identifying data, nobody took the sli ghtest notice - perhaps because it was already known that the 'freedom-promoting' US authorities were contemplating the same practices. But few seem to care about the vast GULAGS in China, Burma, North Korea etc, either. ■"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"614 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich APPENDIX 3 TO CHAPTER 8: THE CONTINUING SOVIET ILLUMINATI GULAG SYSTEM LABOUR CAMPS IN RUSSIA, UKRAINE & KAZAKHSTAN The following GULAG institutions were positively identified by sources in Russia and Ukraine, and separately by a Western intelligence source, as being operative in 1995 and 1996. List reprinted from Sovi et Analyst: www.sovietanalyst.com. 1. A forced labour camp containing 1,000-1,500 prisoners in the town of Pyatikhatka, Ukraine, located 10-15km North of the railway st ation, adjacent to the Dnepropetrovsk metallurgical plant. 2. A large camp, containing an estimated 2,000 prisoners, at Bartas on Lake Balkhash, Kazakhstan. This institution serves as a labour pool for el ements of the space dime nsion of the military- industrial complex located there. A colossal explosion occurred at Bartas in 1989, but the number of prisoners who lost their lives on that occasion remains unknown. 3. In Alma-Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, continuing MVD labour camp Number AK-160, for teenagers, provides forced labour for timber plant workshops. The concentration camp complex is located on Tashkentskaya and Seifullina Street. 4. 'Medical City' is located within the compound of t he Institute of Biophysics, Moscow. It is accessed via Tram Number 6, Trolleybuses numbers 12 and 14 , and via Buses Numbers 23 and 30. This complex is a special department supervised by the 'successors' of the KGB in which various physical experiments are undertaken on prisoners brought in from camps elsewhere in the 'former' USSR, who have been working in the lethal uranium mines. About 500 prisoners are reported to be undergoing such experiments and evaluations at any one time. The purpose, given further confirmation in Russian military spending estimates, that the elite continues the construction of a colossal bunker complex at 'Evil Mountain' in the Urals, is obvious: to assess the prospects of human survival in high radiation and fallout conditions such as will necessarily prevail following nuclear war. 5. Near the town of Kopiesk, in the Urals, is Camp Balandino, which has 2, 000 prisoners. At this long-established concentration camp, the forced labour pool is employed at the Cheliabinsk tractor plant, which also produces tanks. 6. A large camp complex (Cheliabinsk-40, Cheliabinsk-60 and Zlatoust-70) has been identified at the town of Zlatoust in the Ural Mountains, some 190km from Cheliabinsk. This camp sends prisoners for secret tasks in the 'closed cities' of the region. The camp complex is controlled by the General Camp Authority. 7. Similar camps are to be found in the towns of Satka, Kusa, Bakol, Ust-Katai, Miniyar and Asha. In each of these camps, there are reported to be between 500 and 800 prisoners. 8. A forced labour camp for 1,500 children is located in the town of Atalian, not far from Zlatoust and Mias. Forced child labour is employed in an automobile plant. 9. An agricultural camp containing about 1,000 pris oners is to be found in the town of Troitsk. 10. A concentration camp holding 1,200 forced labour work er-prisoners is located at Plast in the Urals. Prisoners work in the gold mines. 11. Camp Number 14 located at at Magnitogorsk, which caters for 1,500-1,600 prisoners, supplies forced labour for a military plant producing tanks. 12. Camp Number 78, also at Magnitogorsk, directs 30% of its prisoners, of whom there are a bout 1,500 in all, to work in conditions lethal for human health. 13. In the Autonomous Republic of Buriatiya, two large military installations are under construction at the town of Gusinoozersk (at construction site Number 1) , at which some 2,000 forced labourers from three separate camps are employed. [Information: mid-1990s]. 14. In the region of Chitinskaya oblast, a camp is to be found in the village of Chara. It houses 800 prisoners, who were reported to be controlled by one MVD Colonel Taranskiy. These prisoners were engaged the construction of hidden emplacements/silos for ballistic missiles. 15. At the town of Mogocha, in Chitinskaya oblast, two 'strict regime' camps supply 1,200 pris oners for work on the construction of secret military installations. 16. At the town of Baley, also in Chitinskaya oblast, a 'strict regime' camp provides a forced"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 615 labour pool to work at a plant producing electrical c ondensing devices for t he continuing Soviet military-industrial complex. 17. At the town of Borzya, Chitinskaya oblast a forced labour camp provides up to 2,000 prisoners for work at a timber goods plant which manufactures wo oden buildings for the Soviet military and for the space programme. 18. At the town of Zapocrovka, Chitinskaya oblast, is to be found a 'strict regime' camp for 1,200 prisoners employed in the local uranium mines. 19. At Priargunsk, Chitinskaya oblast, a strict r egime camp provides a forced labour pool for hard labour in lead mines and at a refining plant. 20. At Angarsk, Irkutskaya oblast, a camp employs 600 prisoners producing military tents. 21. In Yakutia, a 'special regime' camp located in the village of Svetlii contains prisoners who do not work. This is an especially harsh establis hment, designed exclusively for punishment. 22. At Sosva in Sverdlovskaya oblast, there are three forced labour camps. Some 1,500 prisoners are employed at the timber-cutting enterprise 'Lespromkhoz'. 23. A large number of forced labour camps are sca ttered around the Siberian and Ural taiga, where prisoners are employed in the felling and cutting of wood. The number of prisoners employed in these camps is unknown, not least because some of these camps are moved when the local timber resources have been exhausted. These 'moving camps' are not to be confused with camps, prisons and psychiatric jails the location and addresses of whic h are moved by the authorities from time to time in order to conceal t heir existence from the West. 24. At six or seven plants in the city of Kiro v, prisoners alone are now employed. So-called 'free workers' are unwilling to work at these locations, given the extremely low wages on offer. The relevant forced labour camps have all been established within the perimeter fences of the plants in question. Between 300 and 350 prisoners work at each plant. 25. In a special secret zone located some 18km from the town of Chernogorsk (Krasnoyarskiy Krai) is a large chemical plant. Since t he plant environment is extremely damaging to human health, the plant employs unremunerated forced labour prisoners only. At least 2,000 prisoners are reported to be working there. 26. At Krasnoyarskiy Krai, some 1,200 prisoners and ex iled ex-prisoners are also forced to work at a plant in the aluminium town of Sayanogorsk. 27. Concentration camp Number 9, for children, is located in the town of Ust-Abakan, also in Krasnoyarskiy Krai. Between 800 and 1,000 child prisoners were held there when this intelligence was being gathered in 1996. They are employed making wooden formes for use in the aluminium plant at Sayanogorsk. 28. Also located at Ust-Abakan are forced labour camps Numbers 5 and 22. The prisoners at these camps are employed in timber-felling and cutting operations. 29. Concentration camps Numbers 16 and 39 are to be found close to the town of Minusinsk (Krasnoyarskiy Krai). Each contains between 1,200 and 1,500 prisoners - again, all employed in timber-related activities. 30. A prison with the name Butirskaya', located in Moscow, has an average of 200 prisoners in cells originally constructed to house 25 people. The pris oners in this establishment cannot sit down. They take turns to sleep standing up, for three or four h ours at a time. Prisoners are reportedly kept in cells like these for up to three years. INFORMATION ABOUT 'POST'-SOVIET LABOUR CAMPS IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA • The authorities do not attempt to hide the existence of the GULAG, and indeed openly display the fact of its continued existence on Russian television. In doing so, they rely, with good reason, upon Western ignorance and complacency, and upon their deep understanding of compromised Western intelligence. Because the existence of the GULA G system, and the nauseat-ingly obscene horrors of life in the prison camps, are so alien to the experience of Western observers, detailed information on the subject is, the Soviet planners recognise, always likely to be rejected in the West - and certainly never talked about in politically correct or polite circles. This is the psychological safeguard on which they rely generally to mask human rights abuses from the West's consciousness. Yet detailed information in our own files concerning the sufferings, since the 'collapse of Communism', of named individuals in Georgia alone who have, since 1992, been tortured and raped, and who have experienced unspeakable abuses - including"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"616 C HAPTER 8: The Thousand-Year Reich enforced lack of sleep, being run over by armoured vehicles on purpose, lack of food and water, and electric shock - would necessitate many further pages of analysis. • A feature film showing the conditions at 'Butirskaya' prison in Moscow, described briefly above, was shown on Russian television in 1995. On 26th March 1996, Russia's TV Channel 25 broadcast a programme about newly constructed GULAG prisons and labour camps. And some years ago, the Russian magazine 'Ogonek' published a series of articles by a certain V. Eremin in which the total number of GULAG prison camps known to exist in the Komi Autonomous Republic was reported to be 250. This total was revised downwards by Soviet Analyst, to 246 camps. • The late Israeli-Russian GULAG survivor, Avraham Shifrin, reported a total of 36 GULAG camp addresses in Komi A.S.S.R., in a Guidebook, first published in 1980. According to Eremin, 200 of these Komi camps belong to the 'strict regime' categor y, in which prisoners starve. In some of these camps, prisoners were reported by Eremin to b ear tattoos on their cheeks or foreheads carrying inscriptions such as 'Slave of Communism', 'Slave of the KGB', and so forth. OTHER REFERENCES TO NEW GULAG CAMPS • THE EXPERIENCE OF BRITISH MPS • In January 1990, Avraham Shifrin reported, in an open letter entitled 'A Performance: Glasnost and Perestroika', that some 2,500 camps were now, under the enlightened President Gorbachev, holding an expanded population of 7 million inmates. In subsequent statements he insisted that many new camps had been constructed throughout the 'former' USSR, in addition to the existing network of GULAG establishments. In 1995, the Russian hum an rights activist and Duma delegate, Sergei Kovaliov, drew international attention to the existence of what are known as 'filtration camps' in Russia. Mr Kovaliov was supposedly arrested on 27th December 1994 and thrown in the KGB's Lefortovo prison, after visiting KGB Colonel Anatoliy Trofimov to plead for some incarcerated individuals. On 17th January 1995, Trofimov was appointed by Yeltsin's Decree Number 285 to be FSB [KGB] Chief for the City of Moscow and the Moscow region. Given t hese 'circumstances', it is likely that Kovaliov was a controlled 'human rights activist' whose primary task was to demonstrate the freedom of Russians to protest about such disagreeable matters as prison camps, while also performing the function of deflecting other criticism and reassuri ng Western observers that there is 'vigorous opposition' to the nefarious camp system. There is, of course, nothing of the kind. • According to the distinguished German analyst a nd former Bundestag member, Hans Graf Huyn, Kovaliov said that 'innocent inhabitants of the Chechen Republic are tortured and mistreated in 'filtration camps' [KZs]. We have reason to state t hat the situation in these camps is more than worrying. People are being beaten and maltreated when arrested, and also throughout their entire time spent in internment'. Graf Huyn further reported that the head of the Institute for Soviet Studies [ISOS] in Frankfurt, Professor Dr. Nikolai Nor-Messe k, pointed out in the 7th April 1996 issue of Welt am Sonntag' that in the European segment of Russia alone, there were more than 44 so-called 'filtration camps'. •A further twelve such camps are located in the North Caucasus region, and this expert's estimate was that these particular camps contained at least 80,000 people. He added: 'How many of those in prison have to date died is not precisely ascertainable. In Moscow human rights circles, however, the talk is already of many hundred deaths, while what is going on is being compared with the establishment of concentration camps in Hitler's Germany. Accordi ng to the information available, these camps are situated in deep caves in the ground, in former mi nes, in the operations rooms of Russian partisan bands, and in former silo installations of the Russian rocket forces'. Professor Dr. Nor-Mesek concluded: 'In these places, people taken prisoner are treated like cattle before being transported away to KZs. Many do not get as far as the camps due to exhaustion and starvation. Those arrested are tortured with such methods as el ectric shock treatment'. • At the height of 'Gorbymania', when the Western media was prepared to absorb and broadcast any fairytales fed to them by the Information Warfare outlets controlled by international intelligence cadres, a delegation of British MPs travelled to Mo scow by invitation to see one or more 'former' Soviet GULAG concentration camps which had been specially emptied for international public con sumption purposes. After three days of uncertainty, visits to the Bolshoi Theatre, banquets and sim ilar distractions, they discovered that it had been ordai ned that no visits were going to take place. One by one, therefore, the party split up and the MPs returned to London, having seen nothing. •A comparison with the data in Appendix 2 will of course reveal the Luciferian nature of both political regimes."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 617 CONCLUSION THE SCISSORS STRATEGY DARK ACTORS PLAYING GAMES AND FACING BOTH WAYS The hand that slays must lift the fallen, while the lips given to cursing must be taught to pray. The heart that hates must learn the mystery of compassion' 1 . This cynical affirmation of the central characteristic of all who have pe rmitted themselves to become trapped inside the living hell of illuminised (i.e., penetrated by the Illuminati) Freemasonry - two-faced double-mindedness - was written by one of Masonry's most 'illustrious' writers, Manly P. Hall - the author of numerous esoteric and occult Masonic and Rosicrucian works promoting the 'New World Order' 2 . The passage appears on the same page as Manly P. Hall's confirmation that the 'force' with which brainwashed Illuminised Fr eemasons connect, is demonic. The text, cited before in this work of course, because of its central importance, reads as follows: 'When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his [witch]Craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy' 3 . The most brilliantly explicit contemporary description of how the 'seething energies of Lucifer' have been exploited is to be found in Craig Heimbichner's book 'Blood on the Altar: The Secret History of the World's Most Dangerous Secret Society' 4 - which he identifies as Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), driven for many years by the British intelligence officer and Satanist, Aleister Crowley, and to which George Bush Sr. is alleged to belong. This would appear to be the 'open' manifestation of Albert Pike's revived occult Palladian Rite. Heimbichner's analysis of how this demonic force has leveraged the 'seething energies of Lucifer' so that the whole world is deceived , is of unparalleled excellence, and it would therefore be invidious for this Author to add to Heimbichner's study. With consummate skill, he shows how the various strands of Gnosticism dating from the very birth of Christ interconnect and relate to each other, and how witchcraft and lies are today being accentuated in part as a consequence of the Luciferian operations of O.T.O., a branch of the llluminati. The present work shows that the llluminati provide deep cover and an unparalleled global network for the never-e nding pursuit of German (Nazi) long-range global hegemony deception strategy, encapsulated in the slogan, foolishly thought by the West to be dead and buri ed: Deutschland Uber Alles. Whether German long-range intelligence strategists have hijacked the llluminati, or vice versa, remains, on the face of it, impenetrable. Whatever the truth of this matter, if it is ever capable of being disentangled, it is a certainty that the European llluminati powers are 'fighting it out among themsel ves', like rats in a sack, all over again - with the 'Black Nobility' divided among themselves a nd far from comfortable, in many cases, with the ruthless German global hegemony agenda. Citing the malevolent importance of the French con-man Pierre Plantard (1920-"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"618 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy 2000), Heimbichner shows inter alia how the Illu minati's chief characteristic of duplic-itous double-mindedness is capable of infinite va riation, by citing Plantard's cynical contribution to the lies about Jesus Christ disseminated globally, most recently, by the reprobate New Age author Dan Brown, th rough his devilishly effective publishing phenomenon, 'The Da Vinci Code', ten million copies of which were already in print when Heimbichner's book appeared in 2005. With the publication of 'The Da Vinci Code', the primary feature of the underlying strategy of certain Illuminari cadres has assumed global proportions. What is that strategy? It is almost impossible to describe what is intended without incredulity at the subtle deviousness of Satan. 'Plantard was the 20th century godfath er', writes Craig Heimbichner, 'of the fake Prieure de Sion (P riory of Sion) mythos which claims that certain royal families of Europe are the descendants of an invented sexual union between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene'. There is of course absolutely zero scriptural foundation for the 'base lie' it self, let alone for the pyramid of lies which rest upon its foundation. In order for the lie to 'work', Jesus Christ needs to have survived His Crucifixion, to have recovered from His trauma, and to have swerved away from His whole Ministry, which would have been left 'dangling in the wind'. Quite apart from the ludicrous stupidity of this lying invention, anyone who studies the New Testament receives irrevocable confirmation of the accu racy of the Gospels, and of the Holy Spirit's inspiration of all the other New T estament books, which could not have survived had Christ abandoned his unique Ministry as is falsely alleged. Nor could the Epistles of Paul, Peter, John and James have be en written against such a background. THE PURPOSE: TO RESTORE THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS What is the purpose of such ignorant drivel? It is, of course, to enable the so-called 'Black Nobility' to assert a false 'Divine Right' to rule, by claiming that their 'bloodlines' are descended from the Son of God himself. But as has been discussed in Ch apter 7, the 'Black Nobility' are Khazars, of Jewis h ancestry and Kabbalistic Juda ic background. So here we have the very Jewish descendants of thes e wandering people - whose ancestors were almost certainly Jewish moneylenders who became so powerful that, in the course of time, they actually seized monarchical power themselves (as in the case of Captain Stradholder, a.k.a. William of Orange) - claiming to be descended from Jesus Christ, even though by definition (unless conver ted) these people deny Jesus Christ and deny that 'he is the Son of God and is come in the flesh' 5 . Can any more cynical and blasphemous instance of Illuminati double-mindedness be imagined? Heim bichner's analysis thus identifies 'the emergence of an organization that would have an authority so divine [that] it could not be resisted by any believing Christian' (except, the Author insists, by those who actually read Scripture, a minority). 'The lure of this halluci nation to occultists seeking to impose totalitarian rule is nearly irresistible. Their modern agent in this regard was Pierre Plantard, the supposed [sic] scion of the ancient Merovingian king, Da gobert II' It may be objected that Jews have always been at the forefront of revolutionary destabilisation operations, as for instance in the context of the Russian Re volution and control of the Soviet and fake 'post'-Soviet Empire thereafter - until, of course, the objector recalls that such dialectical antagonism can have 'no problem' coexisting with the lie that Jesus married Mary Magdalene, el seq., since it simply reflects the fundame ntal characteristic of all components of the Illumina ti: double- mindedness. As for Plantard, his false-front network operated 'wit hin both Conservative Catholic and anti-Jewish (Nazi) circles, while also organising and inspiring (Judaic) Kabbalist and \"goddess\" affiliates' 6 . In other words, Plantard was an 'illustrious', devious implementer of Illuminati two-"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 619 faced dialectical strategy, a double-dealing Ja nus deception operative 'par excellence'. Explaining in greater detail how this double-minded scam has invaded vulnerable and ignorant minds worldwide, Heimbichner elaborates: 'The macabre irony is that the Priory of Sion, the \"order of chivalry\" allegedly created in 1099 by the \"Crusader Godefroy de Bouillon\" has become, via the Catholic Pierre Plantard and the New Age Dan Brown, the transmission mechanism for the revival of the witchcraft cult of Isis, the black magi c of the Kabbalah and filthy Talmudic sexual libel against Jesus Christ'. 'Perhaps now the reader is beginning to gain insight into the utility of the O.T.O.'s speciality, what Dr Carl Gustav Jung termed Mysterium Coniunctionis (the synthesis of psychic opposites in alchemy). The O.T.O. does not wish to direct only the Left-wing \"progressive\" drive for \"modernization and reform\" and leave the Right-wing opposition in the hands of its enemies'. IT MUST CONTROL BOTH SIDES AT ALL TIMES. As Heimbichner confirms: 'Rather, the O.T. O. is always and everywhere determined to impose the Kabbalistic paradigm by c ontrolling the opposition'- the essence of Leninism. 'The O.T.O. appeals to elite standards of culture and taste [in the Catholic context] in upholding the classic liturgies, even as Vatican agents inspired by the O.T.O. Zeitgeist outlawed these rites fo r general use'. And continuing his analysis of one of the primary means whereby the 'smoke of Satan' has further corrupted the fallen Catholic Church, Heimbichner elaborates how the double-minded att ack has 'succeeded' (for those who believe that the Catholic Church is the appointed guardian of Christian Truth, a proposition from which, of course, this Author dissents): 'In this limited sense, the conspiracy has been quite successful. Tridentine Mass attendance is nowadays limited to small pockets of Catholics who, as targets of occult infiltration, are more susceptible to penetration than a mass movement consisting of millions of believers would be'. 'Here we are reminded of the ancient alchemical dictum' (alchemy of course being one of the preoccupations, for instance, of Rosicrucian Kabbalists and 'higher' flluminised Freemasons), 'Solve et coagula' (\"break down and reform\") - the standard Illuminati 'order out of chaos' routine and the cynical approach being applied, for instance, to the British Conservative Party by the revolutionary mind-controlled operative David Cameron in 2006. Break everything up ('chaos out of order') prior ostensibly to creating 'order out of chaos', which is the 'public consumption' motto of the flluminati (the hidden motto being its converse).... 'The hundreds of millions of people devoted to [the Catholic Tridentine Mass] were - with remarkable dispatch - stripped away almost in the twinkling of an eye, with the long-term objective of creating a new, much more circumscribed Tridentine Mass movement rigidly controlled by the occult' (a Christian Kabbalah). In April 2006, rumours began circulating that the Church of England may be moving towards allowing all forms of worship, without reference to truth, in its churches (the Maoist Illuminati trick of 'let a thousand flowers bloom'). As matters stood at Easter, the Author was unable to find a church conducting a Holy Communion Service according to the revered, accurate Book of Common Prayer, which is certa inly sanctified by the Holy Spirit -wit hout driving for many miles into the countryside, where a small, ancient church was found to be conducting its service in accordance with it. The point of revisiting all this here is to emphasise the DUALITY of Illuminism, in ALL its manifestations and formats. Those who CANNOT GRASP THIS, are condemned to remain forever confused by these evil manipulators. The Soviet literature is full of essays on 'contradictions' in Marxism- Leninism - because double-mi ndedness, pursuing opposite policies simultaneously, is its essence. That is likewise the case with every variant of The Order, and with the 'profane ' who are, wittingly or unwittin gly, its duped collaborators."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"620 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy THE TWO-FACED STANCE BREAKS DOWN AS LUCIFER IS REVEALED Part of the complex recent history of the process whereby the 'smoke of Satan' has entered the Catholic Church' - a process paralleled by th e equally 'successful' degradation of the other 'Christian' churches - was unveiled by Malachi Martin (see pages 369 et seq.). Craig Heimbichner has added extensive fresh analysis to what Malachi published, and to what we know about Satan's constant attacks on organised, man-controlled 'Christianity' from the outset. Craig Heimbichner's special contribu tion has been to demonstrate the exceptional demonic importance of O.T.O., the Eighth Degr ee of which describes Jesus Christ's True Church - the tiny minority of authentic Christians, the 'saints' who are 'in the Word' and who are not conditioned by the aberrations of diversionary and semi-paganised 'organised religion' - as comprising the 'foul demons of the Christians' 7 . Satan turns all truth upside down. And Heimbichner confirms that 'in spite of the s ophistry and rationalisations of Freemasonry's diabolic orientation, truly initiated Freemasonry - even in a mainstream version such as the Scottish Rite - culminates in an embrace of Lu cifer as teacher and the serpent of Genesis as Savior' 8 : the reverse of the Truth. The Catholic Church in any case dispenses at least 48 'dogmas' which diverge from the truth as explicitly revealed by the Word of God in Scripture. To take just one example here, nowhere is there any scriptural support for the invented concept of 'purgatory' - a device that enables the hierarchy to earn fees by se lling gullible Catholics indulgences, and deceiving them into the crass belief that remission from purgatory for a certain number of days can be obtained by saying the (pagan) Rosary a stipulated number of times, or praying to Mary, which is also of course contrary to Jesus' teac hing that He alone is the sole intercessor with God the Father. That Man has no 'second chance' (as prescribed by the lie of purgatory) is specifically explained in Jesus' words [L uke, Chapter 13, verse 24 et seq.]: 'Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know not whence ye are: then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou has taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth...'. Although the Lord's parable of the tares 9 applies when considering the duplicity and reprobate behaviour of organised 'Christian' churches, the double-mindedness which characterises all dimensions of the Illuminati networks, including the 'Open Friendly Society', is so conspicuous today as to be recognisable even to brainwashed Catholics themselves. For instance, at Easter 2006, considerable publicity was given to official Catholic pronouncements linked to the so-called '14 Stations of the Cross'. This ritual, being an invention of the hierarchy, promulgates descriptions of events leading up to the Crucifixion which, once again, are not reported in Scripture. For instance, nowhere in the Gospels is it stated that Jesus Christ fell to the ground on the way to His Crucifixion: it is make-believe. But in this ritual, at the Third Station, Jesus falls 'for the first time'. At the Eighth Station, Jesus allegedly 'meets the women of Jerusalem'. He does not, of course, 'meet' them, as though he were out shopping. Luke says simply that 'there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children' 10 . There is no need whatsoever for any elaboration of Luke's always simple account. The women did not 'meet' Jesus at the 'Eighth Station', but rather followed him, with their men, bewailing the terrible injustice they were witnessing - as we should bewail the Church's duplicity today."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 621 PAPAL PRONOUNCEMENTS DEVOID OF ALL HOPE AND SPIRITUALITY At all events, it was reported that Pope Be nedict and his associates attached public pronouncements to each Stati on of the Cross, of which the following were examples: 'Society is in the grip of a kind of \"anti- Genesis\" described as \"a diabolical pride aimed at eliminating the family\". [The Pope prayed] for society to be cleansed of the \"filth\" that surrounds it\" and for the family to be 'restored to purity and freed from \"decadent narcissism\". The author of the special prayers for the Stations of the Cross, Archbishop Angelo Comastri, Vicar-General at Vatican City, allocated the following prayer to the Third Station (at which 'Jesus falls for the first time', which is not recorded in the Gospels, as indicated): 'Lord, we have lo st our sense of sin. Today a slick campaign of propaganda is spreading an inane apologia of evil, a senseless cult of Satan, a mindless desire for transgression, a dishonest and frivolous freedom, exalting impulsiveness, immorality and selfishness as if they were new heights of sophistication'. Yet these accurate statements of reality are attached to a piece of unscriptural make-believe. Other 'Stations of the Cross' spelled out an equally bleak, hopeless message, pro- viding a clue concerning the nature of the 'spirit' behind these papal assertions. For instance: 'Lord Jesus, our affluence is making us less human, our entertainment has become a drug, a source of alienation, and our society's incessant, tedious message is an invitation to die of selfishness'; or, when Jesus Christ, 'at the Eighth Station', 'meets the women from Jerusalem': 'Rivers of tears shed by mothers, mothers of the crucified, mothers of murderers, mothers of drug addicts, mothers of terrorists, mothers of rapists, mothers of psychopaths, but mothers all the same'; and finally, implying that the Pope himself is faithless: 'Where is Jesus in the agony of our own time, in the division of our world into belts of prosperity and belts of povert y... in one room they are concerned a bout obesity, in another, they are begging for charity?' The Pope then added a warning against steps that are being made to 'modify the very grammar of life as planned and willed by God', leading prayers against 'insane, risky and dangerous ventures... to take God's place without being God', a reference to genetic engineering experi ments and by implication to the diabolical experimentation in the creation of hybrid beings reported to be taking place at secret locations in the United States 11 . What should have been noticed from these papal pronouncements is their total lack of inspiration, hope and promise of forgiveness, rede mption and salvation - the truth of Jesus Christ. Instead of uttering these statements of the glaringly obvious, amounting to affirmations of an apparent acceptance of the triumph of evil, Pope Benedict should have read the following passage from the Apostle Paul, who encapsulated every single point made in these papal pronouncements with the authority unique to him as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ (text repeated here because of its central, eternal importance): 'For the wrath of God is revealed fr om heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth [to reside in] in unrighteousness.... Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools' 12 . 'For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature; and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.

SEEING THROUGH THE FACADE OF DOUBLE-MINDEDNESS The Catholic Church, or the 'Open Friendly So ciety' (not to mention the almost totally reprobate Church of England) cannot even maintain the facade of it s Illuminised dou-ble- mindedness, since even its fo rmal 'spiritual' pronouncements, such as those cited here, no longer disguise the fact that it is actually dispensing the hopelessness of Lucifer: where, in those papal Good Friday pronouncements, again, was there any faith and hope in Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life? Clearly, at an advanced stage of decay it typically becomes less and less necessary for the cynica l two-faced discipline enunciated by Manly P. Hall ('The hand that slays must lift the fallen, while the lips given to cursing must be taught to pray') to be sustained. Satan then tr uly appears as an angel of light - as the inversion of the truth is no longer hidden, so that the notorious pronouncement of the lying Satanist Albert Pike, in which he predicted our geom ason-ic-dominated future in which rulers, Kings and Popes are selected and imposed by the self-appointed Luciferian Illurninati- Masonic synarchical contro lling elite, is affirmed: 'The Occult Science of the Ancient Magi was concealed under the shadows of the Ancient Mysteries: it was imperfectly revealed or rather disfigured by the Gnostics: it is guessed at under the obscurities th at cover the pretended crimes of the Templars [sic); and it is found enveloped in enigmas that seem impe netrable, in the Rites of the Highest Masonry.... LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange a nd mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light? Doubt it not' ... The world will soon come to us for its Sovereigns and Ponti ffs. We shall constitute the equilibrium of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World' 14 . It is manifest that both Albert Pike and Giuseppe Mazzini were Illuminati first and Freemasons second - and that Pike laboured for many years to invent, elaborate and 'illuminate' US Scottish Rite Masonic initiation ri tuals so that they could be relied upon to propagate the agenda, secrecy, spying preo ccupation, perverse occult focus and World Revolution of the Illuminati within the orbit of the Rosicrucian Order of the Quest - and, with the establishment of the Palladian Rite, of which Ordo Templi Orientis is a 'broader' derivation, to prepar e for the advent of the 'New Age' of Aquarius in which, so Pike imagined, 'the foul demon of the Chri stians' (according to the Illuminist Aleister Crowley) will have been 'permanently' exorcised, so that no further impediments to 'Do as Thou Wilt' would survive. Illuminised Freemasonry, as Heimbichner so succinctly explained, 'is a nursery of Luciferianism from which promising candidates are selected, while others are left forever in the dark, content to exploit their old-boy connections, play their charity charade and exchange ar cane hand-signals with judges, la wyers and jurors for mutual benefit of the guilty' 16 . This 'in-your-face' tempor ary 'supremacy' of occult Masonic Illuminism in the United States is replicated many times daily as Americans handle their $1.0 bills, or travel by train past the gargantuan, monstrous Washingt on Memorial Temple at Alexandria. The image on the $1.0 bill is the insignia of the Illuminati, containing the 'eye in the triangle', the esoteric meaning of which is the Eye of Set-Sothis-Shaitan (Satan) represented astronomically as Sirius and anatomically as the anus . [Heimbichner, op. cit., page 138]."},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 623 THE DIALECTICAL METHOD IN TEGRATED INTO THEIR PSYCHE The double-mindedness central to the twisted mentality of members of all components of the ffluminati synarchy is related directly to the dialectical methodology developed for modern consumption by Friedrich Engels, applied with particular rigour by the Illuminist Lenin and his associates, heirs and successors, and extensiv ely employed both by the Nazis and by the US authorities. The classic formula of Thesis, controlled Antithesis, Synthesis, is described by the intelligence and New World Order analyst David Icke (not a source often used by this Author) as Problem, Reaction, and Solution. The essence of this standard ffluminati methodology is, as discussed, the control of all opposition; and the central double-minded initiative which has 'worked' so 'well' for the conspirators has been the conflicting work of the 'Two Karls' - Professor Karl Ritter, 'o riginator' of the mindset that emerged via Nietzsche as the phenomenon of Fascism, and Karl Marx, author of the 'Communist Manifesto'. The launch of these two poisonous 'philosophies' by the Illuminati, allegedly directed by the Rothschild ('Red Shield') family, established the broad dialectical canvas (Thesis versus Antithesis) ready for manipulation in what the Illuminati consider to be our mechanistic world. The Thesis (Lenin's Communi sm) was developed in parallel with Nazism (Antithesis), which matured two decades or so later. And the same dialectical pattern is now standard in respect of all contemporary issues. In the terms used by David Icke, the Illuminati strategists develop the Problem, perhaps by funding, training and assembling an 'opposition' group to stimulate turmoil in an established political context - the evolution of which they intend to manipulate -thereby generating a conflict that the ffluminati themselves have manoeuvred into existence. Control of the opposition forces, central to the Leninist methodology, is in fact applied universally by Illuminati cadres. Typically, both within and outside the Soviet context, controlled 'opposition' groups will be identified by the compliant media as 'freedom fighters' or 'liberators' - an example being the criminalist drug-running Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Finance for such operations is derived from 'Black' budgets, funded by drug- trafficking or by 'funny money' banking transactions, which take place at the intergovernmental and inter-intelligence sector levels on a gargantuan scale. 'Freedom fighters' are not infrequently a ssembled from a local criminal element -in the case of the KLA, from Communist-era mafiya clans running drugs through the Balkans. In conformity with standard Machiavellian ffl uminati deception 'principles', the same New Underworld Order Illuminati strategists will likewise be involved in arming and advising the leadership of the existing established power as well - with the added prospect of the Illuminati benefiting by lending money, rearming and supplying all sides in any conflict they have generated in pursuit of their Luciferian objectives. In the course of such typically cynical op erations, controlled allies - such as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Colonel Qadhafy, et al - may be abruptly dumped and converted into an enemy overnight, having been double-crossed by US intelligence, scammed, or targeted for 'tak ing out' because they have scammed the Americans or their intelligence cadres. In this rat-riddled sewer, former controlled operatives - like 'Tim Osman' - may either change sides in acco rdance with altered circumstances following some double-cross or other, or else will be ordered by intelligence cadres to switch sides. This was the case with Osama Bin Laden - whose wealthy family's assets, as we have seen, George W. Bush actually managed at one stage of his career. Switching sides, treating former friends and allies as enemies, speaking out of both sides of one's mouth, playing 'war' and 'peace' simultaneously, using charm on people one moment and dropping fragmentat ion bombs on their countrymen next , comes naturally to the double- minded geomasonic Illuminised operative instructed by a 'god'."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"624 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy LAUNCHING THE CONTROLLED CONFLICT ONTO THE WORLD STAGE The conflict in question will be coaxed onto the world stage by controlled media outlets using pictures and videotape reports of horri fic and bloody atrocities suffered by innocent civilians. This elicits the intended 'something has to be done' response, which is the Planned Reaction. The manipulators then provide the preplanned Solution - for example, by sending in United Nations 'peacekeepers' (in Bosnia), or a United Nations 'Coalition Force' (the First Gulf War), or NATO bombers followed by ground troops (Kosovo). The sustained aggression and bombing of Belgrade and parts of Yugoslavia by NATO was a criminal abomination - not least given that in 1990, when this Author complained that the combined effect of bilateral treaties that the USSR was signing with targeted West European countries would be to neutralise NATO, he was told that this could not be the case since NATO was a 'defensive alliance' [see box on page 625]. The underlying purpose of these Illuminati operations is to have New Underworld Order-controlled forces and structures in all key countries or strategic areas where significant indifference or resistance to the New World Order is expected to be encountered. Having used Milosevic as a financial and trading partner, US intelligence then double-crossed and demonised him, when the Illuminati's strategy changed ('bait and switch'). The standard procedure when it has been decided to demonise the leader of an established power, is to describe him as 'a nother Hitler'. This point was stressed in an Internet posting on this subj ect updated on 31st December 2005, by Ken Adachi. In April 2006, President George W. Bush was reported in the British press to be in the habit of referring to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran as 'another Hitler'. Given this confirmation of the accuracy of his assertion, it is clear that Mr Adachi's underlying analysis in this connection was correct. Once installed, the 'peacekeepers' never l eave (Bosnia, Kosovo, Korea, East Timor), thereby undermining the 'host' state's integrity, in line with the tired dogma that all nation states are to be replaced by supranational governance in the hands of the 'Brotherhood'. Publicity surrounding the operation is often driven by newspaper articles placed by controlled think-tanks or agitprop organisations with an axe to grind, like Human Rights Watch - allegedly an Illuminati front group, as the Author discovered when he visited their messy Washington, DC offices some years ago. The fundamental rule that the Illuminati manipulators follow, whatever cover they may be using at any given point in time, is, as has been reiterated, always to control both sides of the dialectical tensions that they establish - so that the two 'opposing' 'phanes', or 'forces', can be 'creatively' manipulated in accordance with their global strategic requirements. This basic rule never varies. Observers of current affairs who 't ake sides'are themselves victims of the double- minded deception in question. The model for this modus operandi has been described - especially by the veteran Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn - as the Scissors Strategy. This metaphor is used because it illustrates very pr ecisely how the Illuminati (whether the Soviet strategists, the covert Nazis, or US intelligence) operate. In accordance with this model, one hand opera tes the scissors, but the instrument has two blades. These blades can either be moved away from each other, or else moved towards each other until they join - having cut a swathe through everything th at stood between the blades. To an outside observer, the blades appe ar to be separate forces, since the guiding hand cannot be seen (it is behind the curtain). This model can be applied, obviously, to any environment. Once this simple model is understood, it becomes possible for the observer to stand back from the pressure to 'take sides' - enabling, for instance, the idiocy of British and American controlled 'democracy' - or de mocratism to use its appropriate Soviet description - to be seen for the farc es and cynical deceptions they are."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 625 HOW THE BRITISH MINISTRY OF DEFENCE DEALT WITH THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT THAT SOVIET BILATERAL TREATIES WITH TARGETED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY UNDERMINED NATO At the beginning of the 1990s, the Author argued in print that a series of bilateral treaties, all drafted by Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) and present ed to targeted European countries for signature, were all designed to neutralise NATO. Some of t hese treaties contain 'Molotov-Ribbentrop' clauses, providing that if either party felt threatened by a third party (state or axis), neither party to the bilateral treaty could provide any assistance whatsoever to t he third party. This might mean, for instance, that Spain would have to refuse US aircraft access to bases on its territory, as Madrid might fear that Moscow might construe such a development as an actual or potential threat - so that the bases could not be made available to the Americans under the new 'post'-Soviet era Russian-Spanish bilateral treaty. The Ministry of Defence dismissed the Author's arguments inter alia on the ground that they did not apply, since NATO was a defensive organisation. Within a few years, NATO had effectively scrapped its defensive orientation, and embarked upon naked aggression - illustrating that the MOD's response was disingenuous. An excerpt from the official response is shown in below [Figure 96]: Northern Iraq, both of which were extremely successful. Having taken advice form the Naval staff and the FCO may I provide you with our background thinking on the assumption that the main thrust of Mr Story's argument is that when taken together, the various bilaterals with USSR undermine NATO's raison d'etre. My first point concerns the general theme of non-aggression pacts and recognition of existing borders. Although the MOD and FCO would not wish to be drawn into commenting on other nations agreements, I differ with Mr Story in believing that the provisions in the bilaterals are fully in line with those in the Helsinki Act - as reaffirmed in last year's Charter of Paris. My second point concerns the public impression of such agreements. Bilaterals of this nature run parallel to CSCE and NATO in contributing to the political process of improving East-West relations. NATO, which is after all a defensive organisation, has played its part with its positive statements in the 1990 London Declaration and the more recent NAC Communique after the Copenhagen Ministerial. My final point is that the provisions of such non-aggression agreements do not, in our view, undermine NATO as a political, security and defence agreement. Non-agression treaties are political acts that are effective up until the act of aggression. Thereafter the Washington and Brussels Treaties for NATO and WEU provide for the appropriate military response in self defence. While no one could doubt the political aspirations implicit in a non-aggression pact, history has not been kind to such agreements - NATO can both provide the ultimate reassurance in security terms and, at the same time, contribute politically to the atmosphere that goes with such agreements. In conclusion, we believe that NATO fits satisfactorily into the present framework of political, security and defence agreements. Further, it is NATO that provides for a collective security that includes USA and Canada in a way that these bilaterals do not. Figure 96: Excerpt from a Ministry of Defence response to the Author's arguments to the effect that the Gorbachev-Yeltsin bilateral treaty offensive target ing key European countries was designed to neutralise and defang NATO. The MOD said this couldn't be the case because NATO was a strictly defensive organisation. Not when it starte d serving the llluminati's purposes by unleashing barbaric bombing offensives against the former Yugoslavia, it wasn't."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"626 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy GERMAN INTELLIGENCE NO LONGER ABLE TO USE SOVIETS AS COVER In the US context, so wedded to the 'Founding Fathers' ideology of democracy are the American people, as a consequence of successful indoctrination in the past, that it has become 'necessary' for the controlled dialectical 'opposite forces' to manipulate the outcome of elections by electronic vote-rigging devices (see Addendum 1, page 662) - a cynical ploy since adopted inter alia by the Italians. For the Illuminati, the slogans 'democracy' and 'freedom' are devoid of all content, since their intend ed democratic arrangements represent controlled dialectical manoeuvres, while the 'freedom' they have in mind is circumscribed by the rules, regulations and circumstances that th ey intend to control and dictate. Throughout the Cold War years, the Nazi C ontinuum and its intelligence community hid behind the cover of the Soviets. In other words, in the intelligence context, the blades of the scissors remained tight shut together (whatever external perceptions prevailed to the contrary). But after the Illuminati's planners, le d by President Reagan, had concluded that the Cold War was counterproductive and should be 'closed down', the stage was set for the German Abwehr's deep Soviet intelligence cover to be withdrawn, although this did not become apparent until some years later. B ecause President Reagan and his controllers decreed that the Cold War must be terminated, US intelligence operatives, using Financial Warfare and bribery techniques and drawing upon colossal 'funny money' resources, cooperated with bribed Soviet intelligence officers such as Mikhail Gorbachev (KGB) and Vladimir Putin (GRU), to activate the phenomenon or illusory provocation of 'collapsible Communism' - orchestrating those successive operations to destabilise the East European countries successively one by one (as TV cameras could not be concentrating on more than one revolution at a time, in the interests of maximum global impact). In 1989- 92, US financial operatives orchestrated the largest private placement in history, raising a targeted $27.5 trillion from 200+ international banks, for use by the elite's financial controllers, for the purpose of equilibrating the 'Global Security Environment'. M assive looting of the funds by criminalist cadres within the warring factions inside US intelligence sectors took place during 1989-92 (facilitated thereafter by the orchestrated 'takedown' of the US Financial Warfare operative Leo Wanta) allegedly under the supervision of Dr Alan Greenspan, whose reputation as a 'revered' monetary guru has always reflected only one side of that Illuminist's evidently dark, doub le-sided nature. The vast financial assets of the 'Global Security' funds, however alienated and dispersed, were believed to aggregate an estimated $70 trillion by the time this book went to press, representing unlimited funds with which those who diverted the giga-funds thought they could continue enriching themselves and set the agenda for global control for the whole of the 21st century. A separate giga-store of ma nipulative 'funny money', worth at least $206 trillion, but probably by now, given frantic ongoing 'hidde n' financial sector leverage, up to $450 trillion, is, according to financial sector intelligence sources, at the disposal of cadres reporting to George Bush Sr. (alleged DVD). Bribery of officials to keep them quiet after leaving office, or to co-opt their services in pursuit of German Illuminist global hegemony strategy, is accordingly routine. After all, this method 'costs nothing', since the funds used at the intergovernmental level for such purposes have been conjured out of thin air through clever hypothecation and leverage operations exploiting the characteristics of the global fiat money system, and the willingness of the co-opted banks to accommodate such operations. As a consequence, certain institutions have become giants in the space of less than a decade. As this book was being finalised, a red-hot intelligence war was in progress, inter alia over the disposition of these giga-funds, amid a growing danger of open warfare should appropriate settlements fail to be completed."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 627 In other words, ample funding to lubri cate the secret German/Illuminati global hegemony project for the whole of the 21st century, has been accumulated. The sums are so large that the mishandling of this situation could destroy the US dollar and in any case might well precipitate the Third World War. The 9/11 atrocity was engineered specifically in order to provide a 'common' and 'lasting' pretext for aggressive intervention operations by the Illuminati's enforcement ar m - the United States - for th e next 50 years, at least. America's remit, specified on the reverse of th e Great Seal of the United States, is for the 'New World' to impose its 'Order' on the whole of humanity - on the instructions of the 'Order', which is controlled by the three groups of 13 'Orders' - the Vatican, the Khazar 'Black Nobility', and Illuminised Communism, all operating behind the smokescreen of, or in an environment obfuscated by, Illuminised Free masonry and myriad secret societies, which are themselves fractions of The Order. It is recognised that this structure may not adequately describe the full scope and potential of the 'Dark Forces playing Games', but it is a largely accurate even though necessar ily an incomplete picture. The Vatican-based Political Action Centre, established by Giuseppe Mazzini, has either delegated operations to Frankfurt and Berlin, or else has been obliged all along to coexist with them, given the pre-existence of the modern Illuminati sect's proliferation in Europe and into North America via the German Masonic Lodges and the networks consolidated by Adam Weishaupt and his associates. The Pike-Mazzini axis was established almost a century after Weishaupt's activities, both as a consequence of them and in accordance with the methodology and imperatives laid down by Adam Weishaupt. Logically, therefore, the Pike-Mazzini axis, and division of powers, may be considered to be junior to the pre- existing German Illuminati control centres - one of many reasons for the incessant tensions and rivalries between European 'Principalities and Powers' that are in evidence today, just as they have persisted at least since the 17th century. THE FOUNDER OF MODERN GERMAN AND RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE Arguably the most influential 'alumnus' of the 19th century German Illuminati was the father of the modern German secret service - W ilhelm Johann Carl Eduard Stieber, who served Bismarck and developed the intelligence and strategic deception principles and methods that were brought to fruition bot h by the Nazis and, because Stieber later reorganised the Tsar's secret intelligence servi ces, the Soviets. It was Stieber who prepared elaborately for military invasion by planting agents years beforehand on the intended line of march. He used 'Black' funds to buy up newspapers in France, so that they would spread pacifist ideas, while distributing press information in Prussia promoting militarism (double-mindedness in action). Under Stieber, German espionage was integrated into a special service, for which he prevailed upon the Reichstag to grant huge budgets. Later Stieber became an agent provocateur among Berlin's many revolutionary clubs (modelled along French Revolution lines and backed or spawned by the Lodges). While secretly in the pay of the police and well known to King Frederick Wilhelm himself, Stieber became one of the most zealous leaders of the Berlin crowds . In 1850, Stieber was appointed Polizeirath, with immediate control over the Sicherheizpolizei (public safety police). After falling from grace when King Frederick Wilhelm descended into imbecility, Stieber obtained employment in St Petersburg, organising the Tsar's secret service. Stieber evidently first came into contact with Russian officials in Berlin when they employed him to suppress a scandal that had arisen in connection with the wife of one of the Russian employees. His services proved so useful that he appears to have been given a sweeping letter of commission - to seek out Russian counterfeiters and lawbreakers who had sought refuge in Germany, and to identify 'demagogues' and polit-"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"628 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy ical offenders. He accordingly organised large networks of agents in Berlin and other cities, and police officials throughout Germ any were ordered to place themselves at Stieber's disposal in respect of all Russian affairs. It was under these conditions that intimate relations developed between the Russian secret service and the Prussian Government. As one 19th century analyst elabor ated, 'one can well imagine that little of interest which Stieber discovered as a Russian agent failed to reach the ears of that other person - Stieber, the Prussian agent' 17 . In 1863, Stieber was introduced to Bismarck, who in due course assigned him the task of preparing for the invasion of Bohemia by supplying Bismarck with comprehensive topographical information. Accordingly, Stieber himself toured the region, disguised as a pedlar selling cheap religious statuary and in decent pictures. During the war against Austria, Stieber accompanied the Prussian military as head of what he called the 'Political Police', which he distinguished from ordinary military police guards. Bismarck subsequently authorised Stieber to extend the scope of the Political Police force's operations. He took action against spies (counterintelligence) and established control over letters and telegrams, while also controlling all printed material and newspaper correspondence from the front (censorship). He also organised the distribution to the Prussian military of information about the enemy. At the end of the Austrian War, Stieber laid plans before Bismarck for setting up a Central Information Bureau, which provided the Government with extensive intelligence and controlled the media. Stieber also deployed his honed intelligence skills to guide the outcome of the subsequent Franco-Prussian War. Stieber's organisation of both the Prussian and the Russian secret services provides a pragmatic explanation of the close intelligence relations between Russia and Germany that have persisted ever since. Because such operatives alternately fall out and collaborate with each other, given that the Devil is the author of confusion, the apparent severance of relations when the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact collapsed, represented no intelligence discontinuity. In reality, the presence at the highest level of Stalin's con- Figure 97: View of a US concentration camp today, belonging to the Rex 84 Program.

This remains the case. TWO BLADES OF THE SAME CONTROLLED PAIR OF SCISSORS The reason for this is that, thanks initially to Stieber, the two intelligence communities were, and remain, the two blades of the common pair of scissors manipulated by the German Illuminati. Why else is it reliably reported by US intelligence contacts of this Author that GRU-President Vladimir Putin, whose wife is on record as having referred to her husband as a 'vampire' 18 , allegedly surfaces from time to time in Germany to attend occult ceremonies at Dachau, the seat of the Ge rman 'Black' intelligence successors of the Abwehr, Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD)? Finally, and most crucially of all, we can see the 'Scissors Strategy' at work with astonishing 'success' in respect of defeated Nazi Germany's long-term revenge against its two 'main enemies', which are considered to be one - Britain and the United States. The Author is certain that the European Union is a long-range strategic deception operation of German 'Black' intelligence (DVD), designe d to subjugate the whole of Europe, and especially the primary European target, Britain, within a German sphere of influence and control. Germany's main ally in this venture is (Vichy) France, the two countries being bound together under the 1963 Treaty of the Elysee, wh ich is of indefinite duration. Under this Treaty, the two Governments are obliged to reach a 'common position' in respect of all inter- national issues and relations that concern them individually, and must present this common stance at all international meetings in which they participate 19 . It is axiomatic, therefore, that intelligence relations, both 'White' and 'Black', between the two countries are always close. At the same time, Germany and France are bound to Russia by interlocking SCISSORS STRATEGY SHOWING THE GERMAN/FRENCH-SOVIET DIALECTICAL MODEL This model presupposes massive long-range Germ an penetration of US structures and the internal corruption and skewing of US intelligence by the DVD: see also page XXXIII. Note: For practical reasons, this book does not address the Chinese and Japanese elements of the long-range strategic offensive against the 'Main Enemy'. Including them would necessitate the placement of Japanese intell- igence on the up per blade, and Chinese intelligence on both blades of the scissors. Chinese intelligence works closely with German and French intelligence, and always with the KGB and the Soviet GRU.

Britain, which is struggling behind the scenes to extricate itself from the EU Collective, has been caught in this Nazi trap, and defanged - and its military class and military-industrial complex semi-collectivised. The other blade of the German Illuminati's scissors has cut a swathe since the Second World War through the United States' corrupted institutions, installing a Nazi Fifth Column at the highest levels of Government , within the intelligence services, and in the military. At least 32,000 German agents were known to be opera ting in the United States even before the 1939-45 War. As the Nazi authors of the 'Madrid Circular Letter' proclaimed to their intended recipients, 'For us the War never ended' ('Fur uns der Krieg ist niemals vorbei') and 'We will build the Thousand-year Re ich on the Ruins of the United States'. They have made, and are making, stunning progress. If we overlook the Illuminati dimension momentarily, we can indeed see clearly that this Scissors Strategy has be en crowned with 'success'. But when we restore the invisible hand to the scissors, we make the unpleasant discovery that the Illuminati cadres in both countries (Britain and the United States) ar e secretly collaborating with their German Illuminati associates in pursuit of the idolatrous objective laid out and rationalised by Adam Weishaupt: unfettered globa l control. And the pivot pin on which the blades of the scissors move is the alleged DVD agent-strategist, George Bush Sr.. BUT A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND But before we scare ourselves to death, let us take comfort from the following reality. According to a US source at the highest level of the controlling Illuminati cadres there, the struggle for hegemony is indeed being waged by European powers which are at loggerheads with each other. The Author was to ld, by proxy, to leave these evil powers to fight it out among themselves, and not to get caught in the cross-hairs. So we can take comfort from Jesus Christ's logical statement that a house divided against itself cannot stand 20 . For it is clear, from this Author's close observations, that the Illuminati cadres are permanently riven with rivalries and hatreds that can never be reliably repaired. Individuals and cadres among them may imagine that they can reach accords, and that trust can be established; but since all these Da rk Actors are Playing Games, by definition, none of them can ever be trusted; and not only do they distrust each other, but they are liable at any moment to be at each others' throats and to resort to threats, blackmail and murder in pursuit of their reprobate 'Quest'. Temporary accommodations are typically reached among the different competing national and international factions; but the hatr eds, rivalries, 'bait and switch' mentality and propensity to double-cross, always gain the upper hand. In accordance with the Jesuit principle, everyone spies on every one else (a horrifying discovery, when one interacts with these people in the United States), US intelligence operatives threaten each other all the time, and nothing most of them say can ever be believed (providing many with a form of Satanic 'cover'). They are also hampered by the rigorously applied system of compartmentalisation, which precludes serious strategic analysis at all times. Compartmentalisarion is integral with internal spying. The demonic Jesuitical spy system was installed from the outset in or der to assure The Order of control over its membership. The idolatry of control and power was paramount from the outset. The lust for control is what underlies the culture of internal spying characteristic of intelligence communities, 'bait-and-switch', institutionalised lying, and back-stabbing. This is no basis on which to build a house that can survive. And it can't."},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 631 WHY WE SHOULD BE OF GOOD COURAGE Since both domestically and internationally, interpenetration, double-dealing, turmoil, jeal- ousies, threats, lies, internal spying, hatreds, compartmentalisation, scamming, double crossing and 'bait and switch' trickery character ise the hellish world in which these people live and have their stunted being, it is obvious that, no matter what horrors the warring Illuminati synarchy intelligence and other cadr es may be planning and have in store for humanity, they can never consummate their evil objective. This is obvious, if one applies rigorous concluding logic to the situation. Just suppos e that the muminati were actually to succeed in establishing their lusted-after global dictatorship - in 'consummating their idolatry'. How could such an edifice possibly survive, given the turmoil which characterises the hell within which these creatures all operate? Would envy and jealousy suddenly be abolished under cover of their mad utopia? Because they fear that they would not, the idea is to brainwash populations so that the whole world is of one mind, while those who refuse to conform and to be 'brought to reason' will simply be eliminated. General Alexander Haig personally confirmed to a US intelligence contact of the Author's that the concentration camps listed on pages 612-613 do exist and that plans for the 'treatment' of targeted com ponents of the population include the designation of troublesome elements by a colour-coding system: Red, destined for immediate liquidation, for instance in gas vans en route or at the alleged Amtrak Indianapolis gassing facility; Blue, destined for 'rehabilitation' (= 'bringing to reason') in the concentration camps; and Green, destined for mild er but unspecified coercive treatment Figure 97 on page 628 shows views of US Rex-84 concentration camps readied for such purposes - awaiting, no doubt, instructions from members of the 'highest' Illuminati Degree of REX. The existence of Rex-84 was confirmed during the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987, being subsequently reported in the Miami Herald on 5th July 1987. The use of the codename Rex-84 has everything to do with the 'highest Degree' of the IUuminati. To suggest the contrary would be tantamount to suggesting that the 'M' on the late Pope's coffin represented 'Mary'. During the 1980s, Diana Reynolds summarised the official Tine' with regard to Rex-84, in language that immediately contains a clue: the use of the word 'Alpha'. The letters of the Gr eek alphabet are used by Illuminati cadres, especially the mind-control sectors, to denote stages of operations -with 'omega' triggering liquidations (exterminations). According to Ms. Reynolds: 'The Rex-84 Alpha Explan (Readiness Exercise 1984, Exercise Plan), indicates that FEMA in association with 34 other Federal civil departments and agencies conducted a civil readiness exercise during April 5-13, 1984. It was conducted in coordination and simultaneously with a Joint Chiefs exercise , Night Train 84, and a worldwide military command post exercise (including Continental US Forces or CONUS) based on multi- emergency scenarios operating both abroad and at home'. 'In the combined exercise, Rex-84 Bravo, FEMA and DOD led the other Federal agencies and departments, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Secret Service, the US Treasury, the Federal Bureau of Investig ation, and the Veterans Administration through a gaming exercise to test milita ry assistance in civil defense'. 'The exercise anticipated civil disturban ces, major demonstrations and strikes that would affect continuity of government and/or resource mobilization. To fight subversive activities, there was authorisation for the military to implement Government-ordered movements of civilian populations at State and regional levels, the arrest of certain unidentified segments of the population, and the imposition of martial rule' 21 . This is the 'pragmatic' explanation for the existence of US concentration camps. But it represents just a statement about past 'precauti ons', not about what is intended. Contingency planning in the hands of duplicitous operatives is extremely dangerous."},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"632 C ONCLUSION : The Scissors Strategy THE INTENDED CLOSURE OF TH E BLADES OF THE SCISSORS For the Rex-84 Program, with Operations Cable Sp licer and Garden Plot, anticipate the closure of the blades of the Scissors - representing the triumph of the German Illuminati cadres buried within the US structures, which is to correspond with the final decapitation of British power within the EU. The 'hidden' hand in the scissors is that of the Illuminati, which serves as deep cover for naked German long-range global hegemony strategy encapsulated in the slogan: 'Deutschland uber Alles'. But because the 'hand in the scissors' is, by definition, a collective hand (manipulated by 39 elements), and because the Devil is the author of confusion, the House of the Order of the Illuminati is unavoidably divided against itself. This means that the hand, though violent and ruthless, is also hesitant and afraid.... The aforementioned warning by proxy to the Author from the 'highest' level of the 'Illuminated Ones' in the United States, to the effect that 'the European powers are fighting it out among themselves' rings ominously true. Especially as the veteran person concerned is of German extraction, and is therefore perfectly informed. The geo-masonic source in question further confirmed 'Svali's' reve lation' that German is alwavs spoken at the highest levels of the Illuminati.

We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines [including] restorating monarchists, dem agogues, socialists, Communists and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form or order. By these acts, all States are in torture; they exhort to tranquillity, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace; but we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our international S uper-Government and with submissiveness'. Page 220 'The allusions to the permeation of universities in particu lar, and of education in general, also spring directly from Weishaupt, or from whatever earlier source he received them: \"We shall emasculate the universities.... their officials and professors will be prepared for their business by detailed secret programmes of action from which they will not with immunity diverge, not by one iota. They will be appointed with especial precaution, and will be so placed as to be wholly dependent upon the Government\". This secret permeation of universities (which are centres for the spreading of mental confusion and indoctrination, and - for the 'chosen ones ' - for infestation with a demonised mentality of double-mindedness [Skull and Bones at Yale, The Apostles at Cambridge])... was successful in German universities in Weishaupfs day... and was very largely successful in our generation' [actually, several generations earlier, as Chapter 2 of the present work shows]'. Page 220 'Republicanism, too, is to be a \"cover\" for the conspira cy. The Protocols' are especially contemptuous of Republicanism, in which (as also in Liberalism) they see the weapon of self-destruction forged out of \"the mob\";'... then it was that the era of republics became possible of realisation; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government by a President taken from the mob*, from the midst of our puppet creatures, our slaves. This was the foundation of the mine which we have laid under the peoples'. *Interesting use of the word 'mob' here: The reader is supposed to believe that what the anonymous conspiratorial 'Protocols' writer meant was the 'crowd', as in the French Revolution. But the American version of the word 'mob' has a double meaning -namely, the organised criminal dasses (mafia). Note that the President is 'taken from the mob'. Page 220 'The term \"utopian dreamers\", used more than once, is applied to Liberals, and its original source probably resides in the Old Testament allusion to \"dreamers of dreams\" who, with \"false prophets\", are to be put to death. The end of Liberalism, therefore, would be apparent to the student [provided he reads Scripture! - Ed.] even if 'The Protocols' did not specify it: \"When we introduced into the State organism the poison of Liberalism, its whole political complexion underwent a change. States have been seized with a mortal illness, blood-poisoning. All that remains is to await the end of their death-agony.... We shall root out Liberalism from the important strategic posts of our government on which depends the training of subordinates for our State structure''. Page 220 Disraeli, the 19th century British Prime Minister, was among the very large number of Jews who were (and are today) aware of the Talmudic takeover of Judaism, and that it is a disaster both for Jewry and for the whole world, since the Talmud teaches the opposite of the revelation of the Truth m ade available to the children of Israel as described in the Torah, thus recommending every abomination under the sun - with special emphasis on paedophilia (which, as th is Author states elsewhere, is ar guably the worst of all crimes, as little children are innocents and vessels of the Holy Spirit in which the Torah Jews of course also believe). Disraeli warned as follows in his 1846 novel Coningsby. • That mighty revolution which is at this mom ent preparing in Germany [NOTE, IN GERMANY] and of which so little is as yet known in England, is developing entirely under the auspices of the Jews'. And in 1852, Disraeli returned to the subject, telling the House of Commons: • 'The influence of the Jews may be traced in the last outbreak of the destructive principle in Europe. An insurrection takes place against tradition and aris tocracy, against religion and property. The natural equality of men and the abrogation of property are proc laimed by the secret societies who form prov isional governments and men of Jewish race are found at the head of every one of them\".

As mentioned in the main text that this is the situation, was revealed to the Author by an American colleague whose elderly relative is initiated to the highest llluminati level - and who added: 'Don't get caught in the middle of it'. The source of this advice was not however, a Christian, and so could not see the picture from the perspective of the Author and his US colleague - which is that we have a duty to share what we know about 'the mystery of iniquity' with friends, and to provide, if possible, guidance as to how it may be understood, confronted, and overcome. The Author has suggested, in passing, that one pos itive way in which this mystery can begin to be addressed in the US context would be for patriotic and understanding Americans to begin a determined agitation for the removal of the emblem of the llluminati, and other occult images, from the $1.0 bill. This ought to have happened many decades ago. Indeed, as an 'honorary American', the Author is surprised that this outrage does not offend ordinary, decent Americans, as it should. Of course, such a campaign would be addressing only a symptom of the Republic's malady, rather than the cause. But it would be most effective, for the following reason. As this study has shown, the Il luminati-Freemasons are obsessed by symbology, using goofy hand signals, esoteric logos and signs as an integral dimension of their secret society system. Their distorted 'truths' are 100% contained within their symbols and emblems. The placement of the llluminati's actual emblem on th e $1.0 bill represented an arrogant 'in-your-face' assertion by the self-serving synarchical elite that the United States is indeed a revolutionary, 'llluminised' power, founded by European geomasonic 'Dark Actors Playi ng Games' to serve their weird, obsessive and idolatrous interests, rather than those of the American people. This is why US Governments are distanced from the people: they are not serving them, but rather the geomasonic llluminati's crooked agenda. Even to demand the removal of their emblem from the US $1.0 bill would signal to these evil synarchists that 'we, the people' have had enough. For they aren't used to being contradicted, and would be astounded that their standard lies are failing. Their primary fatuous lie, which this study has decisiv ely debunked, is, of course, that there is no such tiling as a conspiracy. On the one hand, the conspirators have for a century spread the lie that there is no such thing as a conspiracy (even though Lenin specifically, in writing, identified the Revolution as a conspiracy). On the other hand, the Author has been informed by an impeccable source that cadres buried deep within the US Information Warfare bureaucracy specialise in proliferating multiple conspiracy theories in order to procure the following outcomes: • The escalating discrediting of 'conspiracy theories' and 'conspiracy theorists', so as to maintain the unimpeded 'Right of Way' to which the Master llluminati Conspiracy arrogantly believes it is entitled on the World Revolution Motorway. • Realisation of the potential for causing ma ximum permanent confusion in the minds of researchers so that they follow false, dead-end leads. So, here we have perhaps the Grandfather of all examples of the llluminati's routine double- mindedness. There is no such thing as a conspiracy. So they distribute all kinds of false leads, fairytales and fantastic make-believe conspiracies, via the Internet in order to sustain this illusion. The due to discernment is understanding their duality. Far from being perceived as a threat to the hegemony of the criminalised classes within the official structures, the Internet has been seized upon as an unprecedented, millennial opportunity to confuse all issues, to distort reality, to plant disinformation st ories and to manufacture fals e conspiracy theories in order to pull the wool over the disoriented public's eyes, so that the llluminati and their agentur can continue with their corrupt geof inancial and geopolitical operations. Is there a secret community of interests between Ge rman Nazi Continuum 'Black' Intelligence, hiding behind the deep cover of the llluminati, which provides its most comprehensive Fifth Column inside the largest component of the 'main enemy', the United States, and the Talmudic Khazar Jewish interests represented within or served by the three wings of t he llluminati's structures - the Vatican (where Mazzini's Political Action Centre is located), the 'Black Nobility' and the Freemasons: or are these two 'forces' destined ultimately to fall out among themselves? The answer, given that there is reported to be extensive Jewish participation within the Dachau-based Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, is evidently in the affirmative. This book in any case allows of no other conclusion. ■"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 661 ADDENDA NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER INSIGHTS SELECTED ARTICLES ILLUSTRATING NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER DIMENSIONS The features on pages 662-738 illustrate dimensions of the New Underworld Order in greater depth than the space allocated for them in the main text.

The United States, being a key revolutionary power, conducts Financial and Economic Warfare against its enemies, even while, for public consumption, calling them 'friends'. By collaborating with the Soviet criminalists, US intelligence has maximised opportunities for Soviet black mail, which is the technique that Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) and the KGB Continuum routinely deploy against their high-level US and Western targets.

This in itself is ex tremely dangerous for the Republic, making an outright abandonment of democracy (which is in fact 'dem ocratism') and the Constitution likely. 2: The Death Education Agenda: Exposes the teaching of death-related subjects in our schools, a dimension of the Illuminati's operations to accustom the population to their speciality - death. 3: Cerberus Capital Management: Exposes one 'hedge fund' operation and the active role of George Bush Sr.'s Vice President Dan Quayle, as he circles the globe seeking out opportunities for 'investment' of the flows of funds that such hedge funds manage. No mention of source of funds. 4: Bush on the Couch: A comprehensive precis of 'Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President' by the leading US agnostic psychologist, Dr Justin Frank. MD, Regan Books, HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., New York. Dr Frank subjected President Bush Jr. to analysis using standard procedures. 5: Corruption at Harvard: Outl ines the lawsuit brought against allegedly corrupt Harvard Professors who sa w opportunities for personal enrichment attached to a misguided programme of 'educational' initiatives for the 'former' USSR sponsored by USAID on Congressional instructions. 6: Covert Soviet Financia l Scams: This essay is included in order to ensure that it remains well understood that the Soviets have been conducting 'blowback' Financial and Economic Warfare through criminalism aimed at destabilising an d maximising financial flow s from Western economies, and realising the full potential of their global drug- trafficking operations and drug offensive against the West. 7: US Criminalism Exposed: This report gives outline details of an astonishing lawsuit brought by a Russian intelligence corporation against CIA operatives including the Director of Operations himself. 8. Exposure Document: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case: A US Court document that exposes how the Soviet criminalist intelligence underworld functions, and some of its US assets. 9 & 10: Presentations on the widespread use of Satanic hand signals and of geom asonic handshakes. The hand signals are used openly to signal the presence of Satan: the handshakes are secret signals. It is said that 'pictures speak louder than words'. These tell-tale Illumin ati pictures are deafening. ■"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"662 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 ADDENDUM ONE: International Currency Review 30, 2/3: February 2005 THE STOLEN ELECTION OF 2004 THE ILLEGITIMACY OF GOVERNMENT Democratic legitimacy, however decadent, depe nds upon the perception that the decision of the electorate, however ill-informed (as it usually is), is both valid and sovereign. Likewise, the legitimacy of a currency depends upon the perception that the Government and structures that underlie it are legitimate, and have not usurped power fraudulently. The dollar has been in free-fall, for reasons which include the serial corruption and frenetic movement of giga-funds implicit in the details exposed in 'Int ernational Currency Review'. Other reasons for the US dollar's extreme crisis, and for the concomitant safe-h aven escalation of the price of gold, include the accurate perception that the 're-election' of President Bush Jr., followed by so many pending resignations that officials were (we were reliably informed) told not to leave all at once, implies that this Administration's known disregard for fiscal prudence, and its free-spending habits, will continue indefinitely. On 16th February 2004, a senior US official was reported in 'The Times' (London) to have observed: 'I've never seen any Administration spend money like th is... The money is flying out the door.... They give away money on phone calls. No documents, no budget'. In other words, coming from a common intelligence community background wh ere the pipeline of 'Black money 7 is in such plentiful supply that hedge fund-like entities managed or advised by senior intelligence operatives have had to be mobilised to launder and place it, Administration officials from the President down treat the formal Federal Budget in the same profligate manner as they may have been accustomed to do for so long in respect of the vast avalanche of financial resources controlled off-off budget by the free-wheeling US intelligence community. Indeed, knowledge of this non-stop high-yield off-balan ce sheet financing has made US officials cynical and careless about their stewardsnip of the Federal Government's finances. And yet another reason for the US dollar's crisis, is that the Rest of the World does not regard the second Bush Jr. Administration to be unequivocally legitimate. Reasons for this scepticism have proliferated in the underground media ever since, and prior to, President G. W. Bush's signature of the Help America Vote Act [HAVA] on 29th October 2002. This paved the way for the widespread adopti on of electronic voting equipment and other mechanisms which, as has proved to be the case, are wide open to surrepti tious manipulation. U.S. MEDIA TOLD TO SHUT UP The American 'mainstream' media we re universally instructed not to cover the many recounts which took place across the United States following th e General Election on 2nd November 2004, although some instances - such as the odd announcement very late on 24th November that a Republican Governor of Washington State had been 'elected' after a recount with just 42 votes! - could not be suppressed: your correspondent saw this report on ABC News, rebroadcast in Britain on BBC News 24 in the middle of the night, ahead of Thanksgiving. [A condensed advance report on the dangers of electronic voting was published in International Currency Review Volume 29, Number 2]. It was argued there that HAVA was subliminally or actually predicated upon the pretext provided by the Horida 'chad' fiasco in December 2000, which we and others consider to have been a controlled provocation, organised by intelligence operatives, to pr ovide precisely the pretext needed to persuade the US Congress to approve voting 'reform' legisla tion, of which HAVA was a subsequent component. Even so, it was clear, at least from an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times on the eve of the Presidential Election, that the media knew perfectly well that the voting was to be rigged. This was obvious from information the newspaper revealed on 1st November about the pre-election measures that had been taken to preclude large numbers of Americans from being able to vote. As the newspaper explained: 'That people are dying by the tens of thousands in a war that did not have to be fought- a war that was launched by the United States - is mind-boggling'. 'Also mind-boggling is the attempt by Republican Part y elements to return the United States to the wretched days of the mid-20th century when ma ny Black Americans faced harassment, intimidation and worse for daring to exercise their fundamental right to vote. A flier circulating extensively in Black neighbourhoods in Wisconsin carried the heading \"M ILWAUKEE B LACK V OTERS ' L EAGUE \". It asserted that people are not eligible to vote if they have voted in any previous election this year; if they have ever been found guilty of anything, even a traffic violation; or if anyone in their family has ever been found guilty of anything'."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 663 '\"If you violate any of these laws\" [details of course unspecified], the flier says, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you'\". The New York Times' Op-Ed article added: 'In Philadelphia, where a large vote of Blacks is essential to a Kerry victory in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, the Republican speaker of the Pennsylv ania House, John Perzel, is hard at work chal- lenging all Democratic voters. He ma kes no bones about his intent, telling 'U.S. News & World Report': \"The John Kerry campaign needs to come out with hum ungous voter numbers here in Philadelphia. It's important for me to keep that number down\"'. 'That's called voter suppression, folk s, and the G.O.P. [the Republican Party] concentrates its voter- suppression efforts in the precincts where there are large numbers of Afro-Americans. And that's called racism'. Given the gratuitous murder of large numbers of Iraqis and Afghanis, and the globally publicised US atrocities at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, the newspaper concluded that 'these are days of shame for the United States'. VOTE STOLEN IN ADVANCE For those with eyes to see, there were indeed plenty of indications of prior intent by the US Administration that, one way or another, the national vote on 2nd November 2004 was always required to yield the 'intended' result. After all, George Bush Sr. had, probably by prior design, 'allowed' his co-members of the 'Box Gang' [intelligence operatives working dialectically together], led by Bill Clinton, allegedly the son of Winthrop Rockefeller, to 'win' the Presidency in 2 002. Since Clinton remained in office for two terms, there was never any doubt that the Bush Jr. regime would be 'allowed' two terms by its competing- cooperating 'Box Gang' associates, as well. But officials nad also put in place a number of initiatives which suggested to many that one or more alternative scenarios existed which were intended to ensure that 'Box Gang fairness' would indeed be forthcoming. Specifically: # The frequency and intensity of official references to and hints of one or more terrorist outrages ahead of or during the General Election (scareism): For instance, five weeks ahead of the election, counterterrorism officials were said to be 'obsesse d with reports from multiple sources that terrorists hoped to disrupt the election campaign'. The perverse intensity of official warnings and the constant references to the prospect of heightened terror alerts put sceptical observers on guard that the authorities were trying to leverage 'scareism' for electoral purposes. A top terrorism o fficial even told Time magazine [of 26th September 2004] that 'nobody can give you a date, time or place, but everyone is ab solutely convinced we're going to get hit'. Incredible, isn't it? Of course, given that the United States wa s not 'hit', nothing has been heard of any of these 'warnings' since. Earlier, the then Homeland Security Secretary, To m Ridge, had openly stated that plans did exist for cancelling the election. On 11th July, Newsweek reported that the US Administration was actively investigating the possibility of cancelling the Presiden tial Election. Specifically, 'Ridge's department last week asked the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to analyse wnat measures would be needed to permit the postponement of the election were an attack to take place. Justi ce was specifically asked to review a recent letter to Mr Ridge from DeForest B. Soaries [see below], Chairman of the newly created US Election Assistance Commission. Soaries noted that, while a primary election in New York on September 11th, 2001, was quickly suspended by that State's Board of Elections after the attacks that morning, 'the Federal Government ha s no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a Federal election'. • A parallel Congressional Research Service (of the Library of Congress) report to Congress dated 14th July 2004, entitled Executive Branch Power to Postpone Elections, which concluded: 'Traditionally, all voting - whether Federal, State or local - occurs in local precinct polling places, and State or local authorities have a significant role in re gulating such voting. Congress, however, also has power to regulate elections, and that authority may va ry depending upon whether the election is for the Presidency, the House, the Senate, or for State or local offices. While the Executive Branch has significant delegated authority regarding some aspects of election law, this authority does not currently extend to setting or changing the times of elections... Under a variety of possible scenarios that could arise as a result of terrorist attack before or during an election, either the Congress or the States might pass legislation which would affect the timi ng of these elections'. 'The suggestion has been made, however, that the Executive Branch might have some role in determining whether an election is to occur or whethe r it can be cancelled. While the Executive Branch does not currently have this power, it does appear that the Congress may be able to delegate this power to the Executive Branch by enacting a statute'."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"664 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 • Heavy hints that in certain circumstances, the US election might be cancelled or postponed: For instance, Associated Press (which is so close to the in telligence services that it has to be considered their instrument: viz., all enquiries to AP concerning the details surrounding the 9/11 atrocities must be directed to its Washington, DC, bureaucracy), report ed on 1st July 2004 that Mr DeForest B. Soaries, appointed by President Bush in 2003 to head the Fe deral Electoral Assistance Commission, which turned out to be so starved of funds that it could do nothi ng had pleaded with senior Administration officials for Government guidelines on cancelling or rescheduling elec tions 'if terrorists strike the United States again'. He said he had written to the then National Security Adviser, Dr Condoleeza Rice, and to the Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge about this matter and 1 am still awaiting their respons e. Thus far we have not begun any meaningful discussion'. In other words, whethe r to postpone or cancel the elections was hardly an issue that this minor cosmetic official was allowed to be concerned with, since any such decision would be taken at the highest level on the spur of the moment, depending on the circumstances. But Mr Soaries added the aforementioned interesting fact - that 11th September 2001 was a local election day in New York City (as well, we add, as being the anniversary of (a ) the birth of the notorious founder of Lenin's Cheka and (b) precisely the 30th anniversary of the day when th e first work started on building the Twin Towers on 11th September 1971). ELECTION REMAINED 'UP IN THE AIR' From all of which the following facts were apparent prior to 2nd November 2004: 1. Whether the election would actually be held or not remained 'up in the air' until almost the last moment, since it will have depended upon a high-level Ex ecutive Branch decision which, in turn, will have depended upon assessments oi whether measures to ensure 'Box Gang fairness' were going to prove successful, or not. 2. The United States has no unified el ectoral legislation, and election arrangements vary between the myriad layers of governance and between States and geographical areas. This chaotic state of affairs, which may well be unique among developed politi cal economies, may have been judged highly advantageous from the perspective of would-be election manipulators, as the detailed information provided below would appear to indicate. What is not widely known is that, in certain circ umstances, key political figures featuring in the 2004 General Election may have been targeted for Soviet-style liquidation, dependi ng on the circumstances at the time. For instance, John Edwards, John Kerry's non-Masonic running mate for Vice President, was scheduled to speak in Dubuque, Iowa, in October, when an operative working for the Office of Naval Intelligence was present in the vicinity. This operative may have been, as he claimed to an intermediary, tracking five terrorists at the time ; but his handler could have altered the implanted psycho-manipulative 'trigger' message to procure his coop eration in respect of a different outcome. We do not necessarily believe this to have been the intention, but it is an interp retation heard from certain sources. Equally poorly reported was the fact that Vice President Dick Cheney visited the crucial State of Iowa many times during the run-up to the election. Finally, an Israeli-linked source has stated as fact that John Kerry received a substantial allocation of gold in exchange for conceding the election, which he appears to have done prematurely, judging by news from Ohio and Florida. In all probability, Mr Kerry may have been encouraged to concede the election all along knowing that voting tallies would have be en 'switched to opposite columns' in accordance with the pre-arranged requirement that 'Box Gang fairness' must prevail. By this we mean that the Republican dial ectical component of the intelligence-controlled elements supposedly 'competing' for power and the Democratic elements pre-agree in advance which component is to be in charge for the next four-year period. [The Bush and Clinton cadres work together 'in opposition' and are collectively referred to as 'the Box Gang']. CYNICISM ABOUT VOTING ABUSES It stands to reason that with such information and al legations rife preceding, during and following the 2004 US Presidential Election, something must be radica lly wrong about the management of the US electoral process. At the very least, large swathes of the US population have adopted a cynical approach to the system, with cynicism about vote-ri gging and manipulation now commonplace. The identical phenomenon is developing in the United Kingdom, where, for instance, it is believed that Robert Kilroy-Silk, who has disrupted the UK Indepe ndence Party (UKIP), using Communist-style wrecking tactics, may be an intelligence officer, operating on the basis of instructions that UKI P is never to be allowed to gain genuine electoral traction, which it has threatened to do following its remarkable success in the European Parliament elections held in June 2004. Any su ch intervention by MI5 would be consistent with deep UK intelligence policy, given German (DVD) penetration. On 4th November 2004, Dick Morris, the former a dviser to President Bill Clinton, and a seasoned authority on elections, explained in the influential Capitol Hill journal 'The Hill' why he suspected that"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 665 the Presidential Election had indeed been rigged. Specifically, he observed: 'By now it is well-known and a part of the 2004 election lo re how the exit polls by the major TV networks were wrong.... Exit polls are almost never wrong. Th ey eliminate the two major potential fallacies in survey research by correctly separating actual voters from those who pretend they will cast ballots but never do, and by substituting actual observatio n for guesswork in ju dging the relative tur nout of different parts of the State. So reliable are the surveys that actually tap voters as they leave the voting places that they are used as guides to the relative honesty of elections in Third World countries'. 'When I worked on Vincente Fox's campaign in Mexico, for example, I was so fearful that the governing PRI would steal the election that I had the campaign commission two US firms to conduct exit polls to be released immediately after the polls closed, to foreclose the possibility of finagling with the returns. When the polls announced a seven-point Fox victory, mobs th ronged through the streets in a joyous celebration within minutes, making fraud in the actual counting impossible'. 'But this Tuesday [2nd November 2004], the networks did get the exit polls wrong. Not just some of them. They got all of the Bush states wrong. So, acco rding to ABC-TV's exit polls, for example Kerry was slated to carry Florida, Ohio, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada and Iowa, all of which Bush carried. The only swing State the network had going to Mr Bush Jr. was West Virginia, which the President won by 10 points'. 'To screw up one exit poll is unheard of. To miss six of them is incredible. It boggles the imagination how pollsters could be that incompetent and invites speculation that more than honest error was at play here. The mistaken exit polls infiltrated all three networks and the cable news outlets and had a chilling effect on the coverage of election night. While all anchors re frained from announcing the exit-poll results, it was clear from the context of their comments that they expected Kerry to win and wondered if Bush could hold any key state. 'The exit pollsters plead that they oversampled wome n and that this led to their mistakes. But the very first thing a pollster does is weight or quota for gend er. Once the female vote reaches 52% of the sample, one either refuses additional female respondents or weights do wn the ones one subsequently counted. This, dear Watson, is elementary.... so the possibility of biased exit polling, deliberately manipulated in order to try to chill the Bu sh turnout, must seriously be considered'. 'At the very least, the exit pollsters should have to explain, in public, how they were so wrong. Since their polls, if biased or cooked, represented an at tempt to use the public airwaves to reduce the voter turnout, they should have to explain their errors in a very public and perhaps official forum. This was no mere mistake. Exit polls cannot be as wrong right acro ss the board as they were on election night I suspect foul play'. It is important to bear in mind that Dick Morris, though a key Clinton election engineer, subsequently distanced himself from the Democrats and effectively switched political allegiances. This makes his early post-election protestations all the more credible, which of course they are anyway, given his recognised professional expertise in this area KERRY WIN EXPECTED ON ELECTION NIGHT Your correspondent himself went to bed on Electi on Night in New York convinced, from anecdotal information and broadcast reports, that President Bush Jr. would not be re-elected. So he was astonished when, at not long after 10.00 am on 3rd November, the opposite outcome was being taken for granted. It should be added, in case it might be thought that Mr Dick Morris is biased, that he is the author of 'Rewriting History', a pointed rebuttal of Senator Hillary Clinton's memoir. He also cited, in his article for \"The Hill', 'the forged documents that sent CBS on a jihad against Bush's National Guard service, and the planned '60 Minutes' ambush over the so-called mi ssing explosives two days before the polls opened - thereby indicating that he really was reporting objec tively for the benefit of Congress, drawing from his deep experience as a manager of election campaigns and as a formidable nit-picking expert and stickler of absolute electoral process integrity. Mr Morris will surely not have been aware, when he wrote his article for 'The Hill', that John Kerry allegedly instructed his attorney to destroy all evidence of electoral fraud. This information was fed to highly respectable, genuine election integrity actives known to this service, on or about 24th November 2004, by a high-level US intelligence officer, indicating that elem ents of the US intelligence community are actually themselves outraged by the degradation, manipulation and defrauding of the US democratic process by 'Box Gang' intelligence operatives. Open reports implying that the Presidential Elec tion outcome on 2nd November 2004 was fraudulent, surfaced briefly but subsequently 'died' - given the ed ict to the media (enforced by the intelligence cells resident in or attached to every US press room). Not that we ourselves would have been in any way amused by a Kerry victory, you understand: please do not shoot the messenger. We are talking here about the integrity of the US electoral process and concerning whether the out-"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"666 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 come was fraudulent - which is what, on 24th Novemb er 2004, the outgoing US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, accused Ukraine of perpetrating. Seen in the broader perspective of the harsh reality that the United States operates its own form of fake 'democratism' akin to the Soviet model, none of this is, of course, in the slightest surprising: but the wall-to-wall fudging and abuse of 'democracy' that is now the norm, needs to be much better understood. In the United States, as in the 'former' (i.e. currently covert) Soviet Union, it is neither here nor there who wins elections, as the in telligence services always win. In the covert Soviet context, the intelligence services are interchangeable with and indistingu ishable from the Party apparat, following the interpenetration of the Party and the intelligence services which was reconfirmed in 1959-61, when the Soviet long-range 'decommissioni ng strategy' was being finalised Therefore, in the covert Soviet context, the statement above can be rephrased as follows: it is neither here nor there who wins any elec tion, as the Communists always win. To remind us all of this permanent fact, of which US intelligence cadres themselves may have only recently become aware, The New York Post carried a report on the post election mee ting in Chile between George Bush Jr and President Putin - a top Soviet military Intelligence (GRU) opera tive, who was paid $1.0 billion by US intelligence in exchange for his 'services rendered' in facilitating the orchestrated 'collapses' of the overt Communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe. According to the US newspaper, 'in a lengthy exchange with Bush, Putin explained that his goal is 'the creation of a democratic style consistent with Russian hist ory', the official said. We have of course italicised the word style, which is what this is all about, here . Need we further explain that the covert policy is to perpetuate the long-established KGB-Party deception of 'democratism', a Stalin-era word which, translated, means 'the creation and maintena nce of the illusion of democracy'? BRAZEN U.S. HYPOCRISY OVER UKRAINE We wrote much about 'democratism' throughout the 1990s: here, thanks to 'The New York Post', is final corroboration that this Leninist device to ensure the in stitutionalisarion of false 'democratic legitimacy' is unsurprisingly being impl emented, as in the past, by George Bush's 'friend', the sinister GRU officer and murderer Vladimir Putin. ('I love him, actually', is what the US President said of Putin after he had left Crawford, Texas, during the first Bush Jr. term). It mu st have amused this hands -on, cynical Leninist GRU operative no end, to have to explain to George W Bush Jr. - who as discusse d in this analysis, had just himself stolen his second General Election - that, yes, in the covert Soviet Union, too, 'we steal elections: we know what it feels like'. Likewise, the corridors of the Kremlin will have echoed on 24th November 2004 with the loud, cynical, hollow laughter, like the sound of brass, of KGB-GRU operatives marvelling at the brazen cheek of the outgoing US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, pontificating to the world about the 'unac-ceptability' of the election 'outcome' in Ukrain e - not least because th e supporters of the 'legitimate' winner, the intelligence operative posing as 'democratist', Viktor Yushchenko, were filmed waving red banners displaying the standard portrait of Che Guevara. It is indeed difficult to imagine how much more ri diculous the American State Department could have made itself appear before the international commu nity. No wonder US press rooms were, as revealed above, instructed not to report the disgraceful fi ndings of US election fraud- watchers, such as the information provided in this analysis below. DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF U.S. VOTERS On 22nd September, Reuters reported that 'millions of US citizens, including a di sproportionate number of black voters, will be blocked from voting in the November 2 Presidential Election because of legal barriers, faulty procedures or dirty tricks. The larges t category of those disenfranchised consists of almost five million former felons who have served prison sentences and have been deprived of the right to vote under laws that have roots in the post-Civil War 19th century and were aimed at preventing Black Americans from voting. But millions of other votes in the 2000 Presidential Election were lost due to clerical and administrative errors, while civil rights organisations have catalogued numerous tactics aimed at suppressing Black voter turnout. Polls cons istently find that Black Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats'. According to the US Commission on Human Rights, 'there are individuals and officials who are actively trying to stop people from voting who they think will vote against their party, and that nearly always means stopping Black people from voting Democratic'. A field o fficer for People for the American Way, Vicky Beasley, told Reuters that 'in elections in Baltimore in 2002 and in Georgia last year, Black voters were sent fliers saying an yone who hadn't paid utility bills or who had any outstandi ng parking tickets or were behind on their rent would be arrest ed at polling stations. It happens in every election cycle'. In other words, of course, US election fra ud is nothing new. But what appears to be new"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 667 is that it is being directed from the highest level. In the course of a mayoral election in Philadelphia in 2003, people pretending to be plainclothes police of ficers stood outside some polling stations asking people to identify themselves. There were also reports of mysterious people videotaping voters waiting in line to cast their votes in black neighbourhoods. Mr Sp encer Overton, who teaches legal studies at George Washington University, informed Reuters that mi nority voters might be deterred from voting simply by election officials demanding to see dr iving licences before handing them a ballot paper, despite the fact that the Federal Government does not require people to produce a photo ID unless they are first-time voters who registered by mail. Mr Overton added: 'African Americans are four to fi ve times less likely than Whites to have a photo ID'. Mr Courtenay Strickland, for the American Civil Liberties Union, testified to the US Commission on Human Rights in September 2004 that at a primary elec tion in Florida held in August, many people were wrongly turned away when they could not produce identification. In a report published earlier in 2004, the Commission observed that in Florida, where President Bush won the bitterly disputed provocation- election in 2000 by 537 votes, Black voters had been ten times more likely than non-Black voters to have their ballots rejected, and were often prevented from voting because their names were erroneously purged from registration lists. Florida is also one of 14 US States that prohibit ex -felons from voting. A total of seven percent of the electorate but 16% of Black voters in Florida are disen franchised. In other swing St ates, 4.6% of voters in Iowa, but 25% of Blacks, were disenfranchised in 2000 as ex-felons. In Nevada, the numbers were 4.8% of all voters but 17% of Blacks; and in New Mexi co, 6.2% of all voters by 25% of all Blacks. The Commission on Civil Rights added that 13% of all Black men in the United States are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. These details raise another issue of immense importance for the future of what remains of the battered American Republic. Digging around for further such evidence, we have found a report by the Advancement Project, which seeks to ensure 'fair multiracial elections'. This lobby organisation recently confirmed that regist rars across the United States 'often claimed not to have received voter registration form s, or else rejected them for tech nical reasons that could have been corrected easily before voting day if the applicant had known that there was a problem'. Large numbers of voters who had registered comparatively late in 'swing States' reportedly found that their names were not shown on the electoral rolls when they showed up to vote. REPUBLICANS CAN NEVER WIN LEGITIMATELY AGAIN: THAT'S THE PROBLEM The underlying theme here is clear to anyone who has not already fallen asleep, given all this detail. The combination of open-ended immigration from Third World countries (a Marxist ploy to mix the races, on the theory that, eventually, all national loyalties b ecome so confused that the nation state becomes redundant: that is the Illuminati's intention), and the much higher birth rates among such immigrants and their communities, implies that the United States no w has a permanent majority of voters who, if allowed to vote and the elections were not rigged, woul d ensure that the left-wing party (of the political dialectic) would invariab ly win elections for the indefinite future. The clear prospect, accordingly, is that permanent US election-manipulation is 'the wave of the future' - assuming that it is not replaced by an overt dictatorship. Even in a deceptive 'democratic' environment where manipulation of the results may be taken for granted among the cynical, jaded political establishment, the post-manipulation voting data have to be kept looking 'reasonable', so as to minimise post-election protests and disturbances. But by 2008, the proportion of 'left-wing' Democrats will be much higher than is the case today, so that only three courses will remain open to the 'right-wing' dimension of the po litical dialectic: (1) To face medium-term political annihilation, en route to an actual one-party state by that route (which, as previously elaborated , already exists de facto, alt hough few Americans yet realise it); (2) To ratchet up the wholesale institutionalisation of 'covert election fraud across the board; or: (3) To impose a de facto dictatorship, presupposing the abandonment of the US Constitution, and to 'refashion' 'democracy' in accordance with the globalist 'New World Order' model. From these basic considerations, the outlines of a US political community of interests with the 'former' Soviet Union - separate from the well-known US economic greed and en vy for access to Soviet energy supplies - begins to emerge clearly into view. The United States cannot hope to remain a 'democr acy' in which there will be any place at all for the Republican Party, which can only hope to survive by institutionalising electoral fraud - a course which, over the medium term, will enlarge the disenfranchised segment of society to such an extent that the consequence (especially given the brutalised, fissiparous tendentiousness of US 'street' culture) will lead to revolutionary upheavals in the streets. These in turn will be repressed by the burgeoni ng powers and forces of US repression, which Yev-"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"668 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 geniy Primakov and his colleagues are helping the Department of Homeland Security (a.k.a. the developing US Ministry of State Security) to devise and implement. For its part, the covert Soviet Union has no intention of ever embracing democracy, even as fraudulently defined today by the US State Department - preferring instead the standard Lenini st 'style' of democracy as revealed by Putin. This is of course the classical, unaltered Le ninist deception method ology, exposed by the genuine Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, of 'controlled democracy', or 'democratism'. Which just happens to be the stage arrived at by the United States, while most people sleep. GRADUALIST PATH PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL It is not the intention of the present pro-active US Republican intelligence-leadership to follow the 'gradualist' path outlined - that is, option (2) above. Waiting for demographic pressures for US electoral fairness to become more and more intense, would be only an interim solution to the Republicans' problem. [It being you understand, a dilemma for those w ho still do not seem to understand that controlled 'democratism' is just a classical form of the Hege lian dialectic (Thesis: Republican, or 'right'-wing'- label control; Antithesis: Democratic, or 'left-wing'- label control; Synthesis: it being neither here nor there which controlled party is in control, because the same (devious intelligence) forces always win. For, even within their 'Box', the players in this cynical game of 'democratism' really do hate their dialectical enemies' guts (just as rival mafiosi, th ough often collaborating likewise hate and liquidate their rivals when threatened)]. Hence, we predict that the Bush Jr. II Administra tion will have been tempted to choose option (3) - namely, the final abandonment of the Constitution and the imposition of a de facto dictatorship control mechanism, either via the ongoing coup d'etat by instalments, or else by means of a further atrocity- provocation, or 'Reichstag Fire' event, representing a 'Great Leap Forward' facilitating the putsch. THE SURVIVAL LOGIC OF THE COUP D'ETAT It is easy to see the logic behind this cynical intenti on, of which so many clue s have emerged into view (including the finalisation of the North American GU LAG camp system, details of which were published in Volume 29, Number 2 of International Currency Review [see updated list in Appendi x 2 to Chapter 8 of this volume]. If our demographic-oriented an alysis is correct, this is the last Republican Administration to have gained power by means which it purports to represent as having been 'normal' (and we have already seen just how abnormal George W. Bush's 're-election' has been). It is already extraordinary enough, both among thinking Americans and to the Rest of the World, that the US is represented to have re-elected a man whose word s routinely emerge in mangled format from his lips, as though he's either brain-damaged or else possessed as the result of a Satanic event (as some well-informed Americans insist), or, as his remote psychoanalyst asserts, is chronically dyslexic [see page 681]. If policy is being formulated on the basis of staccato instructions from Mr Bush that confuse even the names of nation states, such as the following verbiage spouted by the President on 13th March 2001, long before 9/11, the world is in for a period of extreme darkness: 'But the true threats to stability and peace are these nations that are not very transparent, that hide behind the - that don't let people in to take a look and see what they're up to. They're very kind of authoritarian regimes. The true threat is whether or not one of these people decide, peak of anger, try to hold us hostage, ourselves; the Israe lis, for example, to whom we'll de fend, offer our defenses; the South Koreans'. On the same morning that Gulf War II was launched, George Bush Jr. was caught on the internal White House video feed, punching his clenched fists in to the air and pronouncing: 'Feels good, feels good' - a delighted smirk on his face. So, one fa ctor that the financial markets must now be prepared for is that this man may become progressively more ir rational and unrestrained (which may be one reason why so many of his top officials were leaving in late 2004, along with numerous leading CIA operatives who were rightly fearful of the anger of the new leadership of the Agency ('peak of anger'). In other words, the sad observation of a female operati ve, vouchsafed to a US frie nd of ours in July 2004, makes perfect sense to us. 'Enjoy the Fourth of July: it will be the last' (it wasn't). Considering that General Tommy Franks, the 'victor' of the invasion component of the latest Iraq War, knows a thing or two about the way the holders of power today in Washington think, his notorious warning published in an issue of the surprisingly influential journal 'Cigar Afficionado' in 2003, also makes perfect sense. The General wrote that in the event of a further catastrophic attack or event in the United States, the Government will abolish the US Constitution and will have no choice but to impose a military government. Now given the scale of the corruption revealed, for instance [in successive issues of International Currency Review] it may be wondered whether the Republic does not actually need a dictatorship in order for the giga-corruption to be addressed. A moment's thought will tell us that any such development will inevitably be associated with the opposite effect, since the power derived from control"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 669 over off-balance sheet trading is so vast, that financial patronage (bribery) comes with high office; and, in any case, key US military personnel are all 'high' Masons. Nevertheless, there are those who, having long si nce understood that the corruption (now including electoral, as well as financial, corruption, of course) ha s gone too far to be reversed, do take the view that the only solution to this truly millennial crisis of the Republic may be for the military to arrest the primary perpetrators en masse overnight, to impose military discipline for the time being on the nation, and to preside over the process of 'bringing these people to justice', as George Bush Jr. typically says of Al-Qaeda terrorists, for instance. Will this happen? The an swer is, probably not - since success in the m ilitary is usually dependent, in part, upon Masonic 'justification'; and all Masons serve the 'Brotherhood' (themselves), under cover of serving 'The Brotherhood of Man'. Even so, th e gravity of the situation is such that, even within their Masonic number, there may be plenty of generals (as there are of senior officials) who have had 'enough'. [Note: This was written in 2004]. CARELESS TELL-TALE MISTAKES In preparing to steal the 2004 General Election, the pe rpetrators slipped up many times. For instance, in mid-October, Associated Press ( dubbed 'Associated Propaganda' by one visceral Internet analyst), released a report to the effect that President Bu sh Jr. had won the November election. When this revealing error was picked up, Associated Press concocted the interestingl y ludicrous line that the story had been released as a 'test'. On 7th November, Mr Thorn Hartmann, a syndicated columnist reported as follows: 'Election night, I'd been doing live election coverage fo r WDEV, one of the radio stations that carries my syndicated show and, just after midnight, during the 12.20 am Associated Press Radio news feed, I was startled to hear the reporter detail how Karen Hughes (the President's aide) had earlier sat George W. Bush down to inform him that he'd lost the election. The exit polls were clear: Kerry was winning in a landslide. \"Bush took the news stoically\", noted the A.P. report'. Why did Mr Bush take this 'bad news' without reacting? Because he knew that the real results were in the process of being manipulated in his favour. Ho w interesting, isn't it, that not even Karen Hughes knew about this scam. Yet, notwithstanding the instru ction to the 'mainstream' media not to report the serial electoral fraud which actually occurred, the authorities have been unable to hide altogether the extent to which the General Election was stolen, once again, as in 2000. For instance, a UC Berkeley campus research team has reported that irregularities associated with electronic voting machines may have awarded betwee n 130,000 and 260,000 or more excess votes to President George W Bush Jr. in Horida in the November 2004 election. Their detailed study revealed an unexplained discrepancy between the votes for President G. W. Bush in counties where the new electronic voting machines were used, versus counties using the tradi tional voting methods. The research team, led by Professor Michael Hout, stressed that discrepancies this large or larger, rarely emerge by chance, the probability being less than 0.1%. In the Horida counties which continued to use optically scanned paper ballots, fed into a central tabulator PC and thus vulnerable to hacking, the results contained such extreme anomalies that they lacked all credibility. For instance, in Baker County, which had 12,887 registered voters, 69.3% of them Democrats and 24.3% of them Republicans, the vote was only 2,180 for Kerry and 7,738 for Bush - the very opposite of what was seen everywhere else in the count ry, where registered Democrats voted for Kerry. On a tour of the United States earlier in the year, a prominent US voting procedure activist and analyst, reported privately that he had observed anecdotal evid ence that if the voting was not rigged, there would be a landslide for Kerry. Yet in locations like Dixie County, Horida, with 4,988 registered voters, 77.5% of them Democrats and just 15% registered as Republicans, only 1,959 people voted for Kerry and 4,433 voted for Bush. In other words, the total number of votes cast for the two main candidates was 6,392, which meant that 1,404 dead people or phantoms cast their votes. It appears that in Horida, the main voting scams took place in counties where the optical scanning process was used. Thus in Fr anklin County, where 77.3% voters were registered as Democrats, 58.5% of the votes cast were for Mr Bush. In Holmes County, where 72.7% of the voters were formally registered as Democrats, 77.25% of the votes cast were for Mr Bush. This fraudulence is qualitatively indistinguishable from th e practice in Shevardnadze's Georgia, where, time and again, ballot boxes were brought, ready pre-stuffed with the pro-Sh evardnadze ballot papers , to the polling stations, which were themselves guarded by heavily armed militia. The prominent voting practices activist, Bev Harris , the Seattle-based grandmother, probably with intelligence connections, appeared on a CNBC tele vision programme nosted by Howard Dean several months before the election. With deliberate care, she 'walked' Howard Dean through a simple procedure in which she proved that the results of a test electio n using the GEMS software supplied with Diebold touch-screen voting equipment could be reversed using the central (but normal) Win-"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"670 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 dows PC desktop. After demonstrating how computer-based election fraudulence c ould be achieved, she sat up straight and told the live TV show [check the clip on www.votergate.tv]: 'We just edited an election, and it took us 90 seconds'. Beverly Harris added that the manipulation had left no tracks whatsoever. It would be nearly impossible for the election software, or a County election official, to know that the vote database had been altered. This brings us back to the article by Dick Morris in 'The Hill', which is read by every political junkie in Washington. His theory, as discussed, was that the ex it polls 'were sabotage' so as to induce people in the Western States not to bother voting for Bush (exploiting the time difference), since the networks would 'call' the election based on the exit polls for Kerry. In real ity, the TV networks, having had their fingers badly burned in 2000, did not do this, and never intended to do so. According to Jeff Fisher, a Democratic candidate for the US House of Representatives from Florida's 16th District, who told the FBI on the 6th November that he had evidence that the Florida election was 'hacked'- and of who hacked it, and how - it makes much more sense that the exit polls were right (they weren't done on Diebold PCs), and that it was the vote itself that was 'hacked'. Moreover, Mr Fisher alleged that not only was the Republican Presidential candidate favoured, but that this phenomenon adversely affected him (namely, Mr Fisher himself) and almost every other Democratic candidate for national office in the most-hacked swing states. It has already been asserted here that the 'mainstream' media were instructed to 'cool if by their in-house intelligence cells. By 6th November 2004, the only 'mains tream' outlet to have come at all close to reporting the truth was a TV show featuring Keith Olbermann, who noted on the evening of Friday 5th November that it was curious that all the voting machine irregularities so far uncovered seemed to favour Mr Bush. As for the other media, one commentator wrapped up as follows: 'In the meantime, 'The Washington Post' and the other media are now going through single-bullet-theory-like contortions to explain how the exit polls had failed'. The significance of all this is that election fraud on such a colossal scale implies the failure of the Republic, which is why this development is of such millennial importance to the international financial markets. Before elaborating this point, for th e elimination of all doubt, let us firs t reveal the extent to which US elections are manipulated (see pages 671 et seq.), thus further highlighting the extreme hypocrisy of US intelligence 'democracy' intermeddling abroad, under the fashionable guise of displaying an impartial interest in 'helping civil society'. Everyone knows of course that innumerable elections in the 'former' Soviet Union have been manipulated to an extent which reversed the result - early cases being the successive fiascos in Georgia, Boris Yeltsin's constitutional referendum in 1993 and his re-election in 1996, not to mention the 'festivals' of nepotism in grim places like Azerbaijan. But, as we have seen, the United States is no better than these 'post' -Soviet states - which its intelligence services are engaged, under the current Phase Two of the 'bringing down' of the USSR strategy, in trying to pull decisively into its geopolitical orbit. We now predict that the continuation of this danger ous, reckless strategy under this headstrong Bush Jr. Administration will lead the world towards the Third World War - which, as noted on page 40 of the preceding issue of 'International Currency Review', a senior Iranian official said in May 2004 'has already begun' in Iraq. The Vice President of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), Mr Ali Samsam Bakhtiari, told the Berlin 'Peak Oil' conference in May: 'The crisis is very, very near. World War III has started. It has already affected every citizen of the Middle East. Soon it will spill over to affect every single citizen of the world. Syria's oil production is in terminal decline. Yemen is following. Majo r Middle East producers, including Saudi Arabia, will peak soon, or have already peaked'. [Note: peakoil.com is a 'controlled' intel site]. Interviewed after his peroration, Mr Bakhtiari repeated: 'The present war cannot be confined to the Middle East. It will shortly spill over to the rest of the world'. That is perfectly accurate, not least since the Iraq insurgency has been and continues to be directed by cells of Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU), and DVD. It should be recalled that we published this observation in August 2004 - and that in November 2004, a very senior US official specifically confirmed to us that this is 'accurate'. THE ILLUMINATI'S VIEW OF DEMOCRACY For the llluminati, 'democracy' is a means of collectivis ing decision-making - replacing the rule of autocratic monarchs (in the 18th century), whom they found hard to manipulate. 'Democracy' has the immense advantage from the llluminati's perspective th at control can be exercised 'invisibly' by targeting and recruiting the implementers of democracy - which is what the Bilderberg Group's meetings are all about. At such gatherings, prospective llluminati implementers and t heir servants are vetted and selected for high office - or rejected, as the case may be. Elections are reduced, therefore, to personnel changes. ■"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 671 THE EPISODE OF THE FLORIDA GARBAGE BINS We must now tell you what Bev Harris and her colleagues found in some Florida garbage bins. This is a verbatim account filed to the Author under the headline: 'S TINKING E VIDENCE OF P OSSIBLE E LECTION F RAUD FOUND IN F LORIDA ' by the investigator Thorn Hartmann , dated Thursday 18 November 2004: 'There was something odd about the poll tapes. A \"poll tape\" is the phrase used to describe a printout from an optical scan voting machine made the evening of an election, after the machine has read all the ballots and crunched the numbers on its internal computer. It shows the total results of the election in that location. The printout is signed by the polling officials present in that precinct/location, and then submitted to the county elections office as the official reco rd of how the people in that particular precinct had voted. (Usually each location has only one single optical scanner/reader, so that it thus produces only one poll tape)'. Bev Harris of www.blackboxvoting.org [another 'cont rolled' intelligence site: see page 512], the investigator of electronic voting machines, along with people from Florida Fair Elections, showed up at Florida's Volusia County Elections Office on the afternoon of Tuesday, November 16, 2004, and asked to see, under a public records request, each of the poll tapes for the 100+ optical scanners in the precincts in that county. The elections workers - having been notified in advance of her request -handed her a set of printouts, oddly dated November 15th, and lacking [the requisite] signatures'. 'Bev pointed out that the printouts given to her were not the original poll tapes and had no signatures, and therefore were not what she'd requested. Obliging ly, they told her that the originals were held in another location, viz. the Elections O ffice's Warehouse, and that since it was the end of the day they should meet Bev there the following mo rning to show them to her'. 'Bev showed up bright and early the morning of Wedn esday the 17th - well before the scheduled meeting - and discovered three of the election officials in the Elections Warehouse standing over a table covered with what looked very like poll tapes. When they saw Bev and he r friends, Bev told me in a telephone interview less than an hour later, \"they immediatel y shoved us out and slammed the door\"'. 'In a way, that was a blessing, because it led to the stinking evidence [herewit h revealed]. 'On the porch was a garbage bag', Bev said, 'and so I looked in it an d, and lo and behold, there were public record tapes [inside]. Thrown away. Discarded. Waiting to be hauled off'. \"'It was technically stinking, in fact\"', Bev added, \"because what they had done was to throw some of their polling tapes, which are the official records of th e election, into the garbage. These were the ones signed by the poll workers. These are something we had done an official public records request for\"'. 'When the elections officials inside realized that the people outside were going through the trash, they called the police and one [of them] cam e out to challenge Beverly Harris'. 'Ms Kathleen Wynne, a www.blackboxvoting.org investigator, was there. \"We caught the whole thing on videotape\", she said. \"I don't think you'll ever see anything like this - Bev Harris having a tug of war with an election worker over a bag of garbage, and he held onto it and she pulled on it, and it split right open, spilling out those poll tapes. They were throwi ng away our democracy, and Bev wasn't going to let them do if\". 'As I was interviewing Bev just mo ments after the tussle, she had to get off the phone, because \"two police cars just showed up'\". 'She told me later in the day, in an on-air interview, that when the police arrived, \"we all had a vigorous debate on the merits of my public records request\". The outcome of that debate wa s that they all went from the Elections Warehouse back to th e Elections Office, to compare th e original, November 2 dated-and- signed poll tapes with the November 15 printouts [that] the Elections Office had submitted to the Secretary of State. A television camer a crew from www.votergate.tv met them there, as well'. 'And then things got even odder. \"We were sitting th ere comparing the real [signed, original] tape with the [later printout] ones that were given to us\", Bev said, \"and finding things missing and finding things not matching, when one of the elections empl oyees took a bin full of things that looked like garbage - that looked like polling tapes, actually - and passed by and disappeared out the back of the building\"'. \"This provoked the investigator Ellen Brodsky to walk outside and check the garbage of the Elections Office itself. Sure enough - more original , signed poll tapes, freshly trashed'. '\"And I must tell you\", Bev said, \"that whatever they had taken out [of the back door] just came right back in the front door and we said: 'What are these polling place tapes doing in your dumpster?\"' 'A call on November 18th to the Volusia County Electi ons Office established that Elections Supervisor Deanie Lowe was unavailable and nobody was willing to sp eak on the record with an out-of-state reporter. However, 'The Daytona Beach News' (based in Volusia County), in a November 17th article by staff writer Christine Girardin, noted that 'Harris went to the De partment of Elections' Warehouse on State Road 44 in DeLand on Tuesday, to inspect certain original November 2 polling place tapes,"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"672 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 after being given a set of reprints dated November 15. While there, Harris saw November 2 polling place tapes in a garbage bag, heightening her concern about the integrity of voting records'. ''The Daytona Beach News' further noted that '[the Elections Supervisor] Lowe confirmed on Wednesday [that] some backup copies of tapes from the Novemb er 2 election were destined for the shredder, but pointed out that, according to Lowe, that was simply because there were two sets of tapes produced on election night, each signed. 'One tape is delivered in one car along with the ballots and a memory card', the 'Nexus' reported. 'The backup tape is delivered to the elections office in a second car'. Suggesting that duplicates don't need to be kept, Lowe claims that Harris didn't want to hear an explanation of why some signed poll tapes would be in the garbage. \"She's not wanting to listen to an explanation\", Lowe told the 'News', speaking of Mrs Harris. \"She has her own ideas'\". 'But the action in two locations on two days was on ly half of the surprise that awaited Bev and her associates. When they compared the discarded, signed, original tapes with the recent printouts submitted to the State and used to tabulate the Florida election winners, Mrs Harris says [that] a disturbing pattern emerged: \"The difference was hundreds of votes in each of the di fferent places we examined\", said Bev, \"and most of those were in minority areas'\". 'When I asked Bev if the errors they were finding in precinct after precinct were random, as one would expect from technical, clerical, or computer errors, she replied: \"You have to understand that we are non- partisan\", she said. \"We're not trying to change the outcome of an election, just to find out if there was any voting fraud\". That said, Beverly Harris added: \"The pattern was very clear. The anomalies favored George W Bush. Every single time\"'. 'As Bev told me on her cell phone while driving toward their next destination, \"We just put Volusia County and their lawyers on notice that they need to continue to keep a number of documents under seal, including all of the memory cards to the ball ot boxes, and all of the signed poll tapes'\". 'Why? 'Simple', Mrs Harris concluded. \"Becau se we found anomalies indicative of fraud\"'. DOUBLE STANDARDS The British press is saying with good reason, that Am ericans appear to care noth ing about the pain they inflict on others, but only about the pain they suffer themselves. Generalisations are odious, but the hideous events in Iraq bear out the reasonableness of this observation. The British press has not so far added that the United States is quite content to pontificate about the need for 'post'-Soviet states to 'accept democracy', while drawing a dark veil over the reality that its own elections are rigged, just like 'post- Soviet' ones. This is one of the mu ltiple reasons why the serial voting fraud surrounding the 2004 General Election in the United States is being covered up by the 'mainstream media', on instructions from the intelligence community. It is the identical syndrome as applies to human rights abuses: the United States, which maintains a vicious and barbaric prison system (or GULAG), publis hes, via the US State Department, the invaluable compendium entitled 'Country Reports on Human Rights Pr actices', of which we hold a complete set going back to 1977. The only territory (with a few exceptions) not covered by this gigantic document is of course the United States itself. Yet there are 6.1 milli on people languishing in custody in America. A huge number of these people work for organisations with close US intelligence community con- nections, producing a wide range of products need ed by the American military-industrial complex, exactly as in the 'former' USSR and China. The vast population of this GULAG is maintained by arrests and incarceration of street drug abusers and trafficker s, whose products are supplied inter alia, by cut-outs working for the Central Intelligence Agency and its criminalist Illuminati cadres. ELECTIONS AND THE 'MECHANISTIC VIEW' We now, finally, revisit th e primary disguised issue which emerges from the finding that both the 2000 and 2004 US Presidential and General Elections were rigge d and fraudulent. Power is shared between the controlled dialectical 'opposites', or 'phanes', of the US political firmament. As in th e covert Soviet space, it is theoretically and in practice neither here nor there which party wins, since the intelligence services always win. That is the theory - based upon the old Hegelian dialectical method, which is itself the poisoned fruit of the occult Freemasonic fantasy of the 'orphic egg'. Wh en broken open, out 'fly' three 'forces', or 'phanes' - the (at this stage) undefined overarching presence, the so-called force of Evil and the so-called force of Good. However as the Masonic dupe 'ascends' (i.e., for the Christian, descends) the stages of Masonic initiation, which is an invention of the Devil (unlike the Christian, who needs no initiation of course, since the gift of Grace is Free), he is progressively impregnated with ev er more corrupt perceptions, or 'lines', so that he comes to believe, through the progressive brain-wash ing to which he so foolishly allows himself to succumb, that he has joined or is about to join the eiite whose privilege it"},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 673 is to 're-order' the world for the good of 'the Brotherhood of Man', which is a lie si nce it really means 'the Brotherhood' of the Masonic adepts. It is impossible to begin to understand what is happening without being aware that Freemasonry, then, is a deliberately slow-m otion induction into the 'ancient mysteries' and the worship of Lucifer - 'the great dragon... that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world'. Because we know and must teach this, to those who have eyes to read and ears to hear, the forces of darkness hate us: but we speak the truth. The fact that the ultimate object of worshi p is demonic is extensively revealed in many geomasonic writings, but one quotation, often cited, is of special importance. It is from 'The Lost Keys of Freemasonry', by the 33rd de gree Mason Manly P. Hall [1923], page 48: 'When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft ['craff of course being shorthand for 'witchcraff - Ed.]. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply [Luciferian] energy'. The fact that this open acknowledgement is surrounded by language implying the need for compassion etc., is irrelevant: the core intention, as is very evident from Masonic Rosicrucian documents containing instructions on how to summon up the Devil himself, is Luciferian. One dimension of this slow-motion 'c oup d'etat by instalments' of th e soul is 'the transmutation of personal affection into impersonal compassion' [on page 51 of the above-mentioned Masonic work], which of course induces the misguided adept into denying the God-given miracles of his personality, the very characteristics which should make him lovable and different from every other human being alive and who has ever been born. After serial initiations, the Masonic adept becomes remote and - if perfectly possessed - completely devoid of any indication of emotion altogether. He becomes spiritually dead while still alive. The reason for including what may appear to be this diversion here, is to prepare the ground for a reiteration of the basic explanation for the always amoral behaviour of these people which was explained in 'International Currency Review', Volume 28, Number 4, and which explains why they could not care less about the serial scams they perpetrate, believ ing that they are 'protected'. We refer now to the way this Luciferian elite perceives the world. Dan Quayle, the former Bush Sr. Vice-President, has been touring the United States explaining to selected audiences of financiers and investors how the Luciferian elite intends to re-order the global financial sector, driven by hedge funds. What are these, and where do their open-ended pipelines of money come from? Source of funds is never stated. The point is that this Luciferian elite, about which more and more is becoming known today, believes (is brainwashed into believing) that its membership of adepts has the unique privilege of re-ordering the whole world. Of Tony Blair and his Fabian associates and the Islington set, it is rightly said that these people have 'solutions for every problem in the world' . They know how to solve every problem. This is why the British Prime Minister was forever coming up with mad hare-brained schemes to solve this or that intractable social problem that has been exacerbated by the negligence, the ignorance of, and the wrong- headed legislation promul gated by, the House of Commons over the years - schemes which squander taxpayers' money and come to nothing. For instance, four years ago, the British Fabians poured money into a Strategic Rail Authority, paying colossal salaries to largel y useless, unproductive employees, in the na ive belief that the Authority would be empowered somehow to convert Britain's Third World railway system into a modern integrated transportation network. Now the Authority is to be a bolished and replaced by a sub-department within the British Department of Transport: yet another Downing Street Plan which has gone pear-shaped, because the inept 'Useful Idiots' in charge of policymaking sought to 'do something' about an intractable problem, for short-term gain. The directors of the New Underworld Order elite li kewise believe that they are privileged and duty- bound to re-order the whole world in accordance with their own interests. And the world, according to their demonic and therefore inaccurate, misguided perception, is a wholly mechanistic world, since Man is in charge. Man is god: the ancient delusion of the serpen t. Lucifer, the author of this delusion, 'allows' this lie to prosper in the hands of the deluded and misguided adept. The 'forces' which these people seek to manipulate are therefore mech anistic forces. Over 100,000 people have di ed in Iraq, according to 'The Lancet' (the leading British medical journal) [as of the date of this article - Ed.]. Human life, for these evil people, is expendable. They are indifferent to deaths thousands of miles away, given the success of Tavistock Institute mass programming. So, they say that the United States is inflicting pain around the world? They hurt us first and who cares. Within this mindset there lurks th e following related extrapolation. The number of Americans voting Democrat exceeds the number of Americans willing to vote for the Republican Party (GOP), by an ever- growing order of magnitude. A growing population is necessary for economic growth (reversal of the Nazi racial purity 'ethic'). How can the voting bias of immigrants be offset?"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"674 A DDENDUM 1: The Stolen election of 2004 'SCRAP THE CONSTITUTION' One answer has already been provided: dispense permanently with US 'democracy', even the rigged and manipulated decadent version thereof that is currently in place. Organise another 'Reichstag Fire', and scrap the Constitution. Activate the GULAG concentration camps that have been prepared specially for the purpose. Stick two fingers up to the Rest of the World. In other words, the Nazi component of the intelligence community shall prevail. And let's st art with the equivalent of 'Die Verordnung des Reichspraesidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat' [The Ordnance of the President of the Reich for the Defence of the People and the State] which followed the actu al Reichstag Fire set by Goring, and for which the convenient Dutch Communist, Marinus van der Lubbe, was hanged (false witness). In a most revealing comment, the (compromised) would- be Presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, said some time before the November 2004 election that 'you'll be freer with us'. What she meant, of course, was that if the country were to elect a Democratic Ad ministration, there would be less need for American freedoms to be destroyed and replaced by a dictatorship. She must certainly have known that George Bush Jr.'s fellow Skull and Bones operative, Senator J ohn Kerry, was selected so that he would deliver 'Box Gang fairness', i.e. a second term for George Bush Jr., following the two terms 'served' by the CIA operative William Jefferson Clinton. Nor may she have been aware of the terms of th e deal which, according to a sensitive source, allegedly included, as indicated earlier, the deliver y of a sizeable quantity of gold bullion to accounts in favour of the Kerry family. And, as we have also revealed, another, high-level intelligence source, alarmed and disgusted by the de facto institutionalisation of election-stealing in th e United States, has revealed that Senator Kerry allegedly instructed his attorney and legal staff to destroy all evidence of electoral fraud. Finally, when a contact spoke, ear lier in the election campaign, to John Kerry in person about the prospect of such fraud taking place, the candidate ap peared in no way 'phased' by the suggestion - as though he knew that the US Presidential election of 2004 would be thrown, all along. REPUBLIC IN ITS TERMINAL PHASE? The message for the international community in general is sombre. It must factor in the likelihood that the Republic is on its last legs and that the second Bush Jr. Administration may be preparing to scrap the American Constitution. How they plan to manage th e transition from false, decayed, decadent democracy to the dictatorship they have planned, is hard to discern. But desperate men resort to desperate deeds, and these people - who are driven not merely by the demographic considerations reviewed above, but also by the imperative (from their perspec tive) that the serial corruption we have explored must 'never come out', as one US operative put it, are desperate indeed. ■ • On 1st December 2004, 'The Guardian' filled in for the controlled US 'mainstream' media with a report headlined 'V OTERS TO CHALLENGE US ELECTION '. The report confirmed Internet postings to the effect that voters in Ohio, dissatisfied with the curious decision by Senator Kerry to concede the overall election by agreeing that George Bush had a margin of 136,000 votes, were engaged in challenges to the outcome. Despite (the more than justified) claims of technical glitches, Mr Kerry decided that the acknowledged voting errors were not substantial enough to affect the result conceding the election on 3rd November. But the lawyer representing voters challenging th e Ohio result, Cliff Arnebeck, claimed that new analyses of various anomalies claime d that the election was rigged. It should be noted that our foregoing analysis was prepared before 'The Guardian's' report appeared on 1st December 2004, and before the recount was duly confirmed on 3rd. 'We'll be calling for a reversal of the result based on evidence developed in the course of litigation', Mr Arnebeck told 'The Guardian' on the 30th November. 'Exit polling and substantial irregularities excluded votes that should have been counted. There is evidence that votes cast for one candidate were moved to the column of the other candidate'. Mr Arnebeck, representing a group calling itself the A lliance for Democracy, said that the 'contest of election' lawsuit was to be presented to a judge fro m the Ohio Supreme Court on behalf of dissatisfied voters, and that other voters and organisations were expected to join the case. The Ohio Secretary of State, Kenneth Blackwell, had not certified the result, which had to be completed by 6th December 2004, although his spokesman, Carlo LoParo, told the Associat ed Press that 'there are no signs of widespread irregularities' - which, translated into the vernacular, meant that 'there are clear signs of irregularities'. Clearly, with the recount ordered to be proceeded with, the authorities had to eat their words. The US lawyer told 'The Guardian' that hearings held in several Ohio cities had brought to light new evidence of malpractice. He said that one operative belonging to a pro-Republican group who had been caught in the act of destroying Democratic registration document s in Nevada before the election, had also been operating in Ohio. An electronic voting machine in Ohio had been found to have been credited with 3,893 extra votes"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 675 in a suburb of Columbus where only 638 people had voted, although State officials had said that those votes would not be included in the final certified totals. So the actual outcome of the election in Ohio had not been certified (i.e., finalised) by early December, raising a huge ques tion mark over the sudden decision by Mr Kerry to concede the election. Did Mr Kerry allegedly fancy that he would be a fool to walk away from such a large consignment of gold? John Kerry, allegedly a 'former' Offi ce of Naval Intelligence agent, and a fellow initiate of the Yale-based occult Skull and Bones secret society with George W. Bush Jr, whose father is the high patriarch of Skull and Bones, is also allegedly a former Vietnam Phoenix Program (genocide) operative - as were/are the former chief of the CIA's Far Eastern Division and later Director of Central Intelligence, William Colby, who 'drowned' mysteriously in the Potomac River while out canoeing, William Casey (who later became DCI and, according to an impeccable intelligen ce source, committed suicide in hospital 'to protect President Reagan', contrary to the received 'line' th at he died of a mysterious brain haemorrhage), Tom Ridge (the head of the Department of Homeland Secu rity, who confirmed his resignation from that post on 30th November 2004), and the Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. Hence, Senator Kerry was an insider's insider, so that assessments that he allegedly collaborated for reward with the Bush camp to ensure that the election was delivered into their hands, cannot be dismissed as in any way fanciful. On the contrary, such an out come would be entirely consistent with the controlled dialectical modus operandi of the Illu minati. There are other deep connections in this context that confirm the likely accuracy of this interpretation. 'The Guardian' report elaborated that 'there have also been complaints focused on punch card ballots, of the type which caused chaos in Florida in 2000. In the 68 Ohio counties where these ballots were used in November, vote counters were unable to determine a vote for the President, but registered votes for other offices'. By Christmas, the websites covering the vote scam had been closed down. ■ ADDENDUM TWO: Global An alyst 2,2: March 2005 THE DEATH EDUCATION AGENDA THE 'SEETHING ENERGIES OF LUCIFER' 'The Craft', as Freemasons call thei r abomination is short for 'witchcraft' - which, being the invention of the Devil whose 'end-product' is exclusively death, is al l about death (both spiritual and corporeal). A primary sub-strategy of the Illuminati who celebrate their he gemony so openly today, is to teach children about witchcraft and death. Death is the central preoccupation of key members of th e Illuminati, whose emblem is the all-seeing eye, to be found in the truncated upper component of the pyramid on the $1.0 bill, symbol of the geo-Masonic origins and entire basis of the United States of Am erica - a political experiment organised the European Illuminati and driven by the Political Administration Centre, established by Giuseppe Mazz-ini in Rome, which is the central locus of Illuminism, with delegations to Germany. It is perfectly evident that, whatever diversionary explanation may be fashi onable at any point in time, the single all-seeing eye is the symbol of Lucifer, the god whom Masons are progre ssively indoctrinated into worshipping. Because of the lies (of course) surrounding Freemasonry it is appr opriate to be reminded of the accuracy of this statement. G. Mazzini's co-occul tist and geomasonic conspirator was The Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite, Albert Pike, the 'Pat riarch' of modern US Freemasonry, who operated from Charleston, South Carolina - which remains of course the central locus of the US 'Scottish Rite' line of Freemasonry and of Pike's own creation, the phallus-or iented Palladian Rite, which links very senior self- selected Freemasons for occultic purpos es. Charleston is on the 33rd parallel. On 14th July 1889, Albert Pike circulated the 23 Supreme Councils of the Illuminati, established by Professor Adam Weishaupt, a renegade Jesuit cleric, pursuant to a contract placed by the Rothschilds in 1770. Albert Pike's letter c ontained the following passage: To you, Sove reign Instructors of Grade 33, we tell you: you have to repeat to the brothers of the inferior grades that we worship only one god to whom we pray without superstition. It is we, Initiated in the Supreme Grade, that are to keep the real Masonic religion preserving the pure Lucifer doctrine'. Writing in 'The Lost keys of Freemasonry' 1 , the late 33rd degree US Mason and Rosicrucian occultist, Manly P. Hall, explained to Masonic adepts that they are to embrace the 'seething energies of Lucifer'"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"676 A DDENDUM 2: The Death Education Agenda - the 'energies' which drive the misguided men who have been unleashing mass murder upon defenceless populations, as in Iraq , where the real death toll may be approaching 300,000+. To repeat: 'When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft (= w itchcraft). The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward (t hat is, downward), he must prove his ability to properly apply (demonic) energy'. TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT DEATH Teaching children about death, human atrocities, witc hcraft and abominations, is a central preoccupation of the Illuminati and their indoctrinated disciples and cadres, such as those who have taken over the British and American educational structures. Since these people are all influenced or driven by the 'seething powers of Lucifer', it is only to be expected that they are focused on teaching our children all about their specialist subject: death. Since, as indicat ed, their end-product is death, they no l onger, given their view that Satan has been well and truly un leashed, bother to hide their curriculum. The lovely teenage daughter of a US friend of the Aut hor reports that her child was acting in a play about the Holocaust. What a perfect subject, from the 'Black' perspective of the relevant US State's clearly perverted educational bureau cracy, for a school play. Acting is of course a highly efficient, and preferred, pathway for introctrination. The friend has reported that her daughter now has a fu ll grasp of the horror of the Holocaust, and that her brain is, as a consequence, chock full of statistics about how many Jews and others were gassed and murdered by other means, in Auschwitz, Belsen, Sachsenhausen a nd all the other Nazi chambers of hell. Do these schools teach the children scripture? Sorry we asked. No Christian teaching is permitted in American public schools, and the school boards' standard line is that such teaching is 'a matter for parents'. But the real reason is that, as discussed elsewh ere, the god of the United States, fr om its foundation, has always been the Freemasons' god, by their own admission, namely Lucifer. Some months earlier, this conscientious USparent had protested when her daughter was being asked by the same school to act in a play called The Black Cat, adapted from a work by that dark American author Edgar Allen Poe. The characters in this play are: Pluto (= the God of the Underworld of course, wearing black tights, leotard, ballet shoes, and a half-mask covering the eyes ; A Fiend (wearing a turtleneck shirt, tight pants, socks, jazz shoes, all in greys, black and touches (of course) of red, reflecting himself as the companion of the Demon); Demon (murky red turtleneck shirt; black, tight-fitting (of course) pants; red socks; black shoes; medium length black cape lined in red); Perverseness, a sly destructive spirit (turtleneck top; tights; a flowing skirt; ballet shoes; all in greys, black and touches of red, reflecting herself as the evil companion of the Demon and countering the Fiend); a nd Black Cat (black tights; ballet shoes; half-mask covering eyes and black leotard with white front). The stage set was to consist of five black music st ands, five black sound scripts, greyness, blackened lighting for gallows with a hanging noose ('gallows with hanging may be a gobo or else an actually constructed set piece'). The play is all about murder, cutting the corpse into pieces, and disposing of the body. The State in which this play was being taught in schools is Iowa. When American and British children go home, they play video games. Almost without exception, these are all devoted to the works of Satan - witches, wi zards, witchcraft, necromancy, divination, vampires, magic arts and spells, murder, warfare, intergalactic garbage (elaborating on the Luciferian lie that there is life on other planets), and other abominat ions out of the same Satanic sewer. When we discussed this issue recently with a politic ally active parent in Brita in, she knew all about the current standardisation of the death theme in British schools. She reported that when parents protested locally about a poetry competition on the Holocaust given to pupils in one school, the t eacher changed the subject of the poetry class to 'bullying'. Not to anything pleasant, harmonious, constructive, creative or beautiful: but always to another manifestation of evil. It appears, therefore, that the mentality and souls of elements the public teaching profession in both countries have been systematically invaded by Satanic themes, which is to say effectively by demons, instructing them to teach the culture of death. And no-one who is in authority (in the United Kingdom) cares a damn - or is doing anything whatsoever to staunch this flood of Satanic filth which is demonising our children. On 25th January 2005, there was a ripple of cons ternation in London when a UK police document revealed that 25% of boys in the United Kingdom ag ed between 14 and 17 years had a criminal record - which is to say, 1.7 million youths. This finding was ba sed upon the results of an extensive survey in which teenaged boys were asked inter alia whether they ha d committed up to six crimes within the preceding year: evidently some 25% of the youths interv iewed said that they had, even though"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 677 many of their crimes were minor. These are not children of God, as used to be the case when the society was at least nominally Christian in the sense that parents fe ared God, but are called kids - of the goat. A goat's head is one of the symbolic imag es and worship objects for sodomites, Satanists and Templars - and all witchcraft practitioners. NO KNOWLEDGE OF GOD These children have, moreover, been brought up without any clear understanding of the difference between right and wrong, and with minimal, if any, knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. The United States is a paganist, geomasonic f oundation, in which the teaching of Christianity in public schools is strictly forbidden - as befits a 'kingdom' founded by disciples of Lucifer. But the United Kingdom is not supposed to be a nation without any spiritual guidance, given that HM The Queen is head of the Church of England - albeit a Church that was founded in sin and now sinking in its own self-generated sewer of filth and decadence. But instead of being taught about Jesus Christ, and to read Scripture - as we were in our youth, being required to 'search the scriptures', every Saturday evening at school, ready for a test on Sunday morning - British 'kids' are brought up on on Satanic videos and thei r natural corollary, the witchcraft books of J. K. Rowling, who, as a consequence of her extended s upping with the Devil, delivered via her [Tavistock Institute-spawned] Harry Potter books, is reputed to be a billionairess 2 . This figures, indeed: Satan can make life extremely comfortable for those who obey hi m. By contrast, as one of our dearest US-based friends is in the habit of sayi ng, there is no money in truth. The deliberate orientation of school teaching, an d of materials for 'kids' towards the works of darkness is - like bearing false witness - among the most heinous of all spiritual crimes, and one which the Lord condemns in wholly uncompromising language; which He also used, to teach us all to be humble and of a contrite and tender heart, like the little child he held in his arms as he spoke to His disciples: 'And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in th e midst of them; And said, verily, verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me'. 'But whoso shall offend one of these little ones wh ich believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea'. 'Woe unto the world because of offences [such as corrupting little ones]! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!... Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones... It is not the will of your Fath er which is in Heaven, that one of these little ones should perish' 3 . AN UNFORGIVABLE OFFENCE The appropriate fate of those wh o pollute and corrupt the minds and souls of children with Satanic teachings, death-oriented indoctrina tion, occult video games, the Goth culture and other related abom- inations, is the product in which they deal so expert ly and with such callous ruthlessness: spiritual and corporeal death. Their spiritual death has of course already occurred. Jesus prescribed that they should all suffer the fate of being thrown over a cliff into the sea, with a millstone hung around their neck, and drowned, like the herd of swine into which he released those Gadarene demons. For Jesus Christ to have uttered such an uncompromis ing statement reveals to us that the sins all these people are committing against our little ones are abomin ations against the Holy Spirit, worthy of no forgiveness. For the Lord specifically warned us that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable. These evil educational bureaucracies and those elements of the 'teaching' (read: Satanic indoctrination) profession committing and orchestrat ing these abominations, are eligible for no forgiveness. Obviously, their consciences have long since been 'seared with a hot iron'. Their guiding principle is clearly that children should be introduced to the works of darkness at the earliest possible age, the objective being that impressi onable young people's souls should be seared from the outset by the handiwork of Satan. Thus, they ferven tly and eagerly anticipate, succeeding generations will be all the more steeped in the occult - hastening the day when the true objective of the Illuminati, and indeed the main purpose of 'One World Governance', will ha ve been achieved: namely, the hegemony of the 'ancient mysteries' of Lucifer, all the works of darkness, the summoning up of evil spirits, spiritism, divination, sorcery, necromancy, an d every manner of pagan abomination. For the perpetrators of all these ev ils know that they are themselves lost and en route to perdition. They are not atheists: they believe in Lucifer and his angels. Because of this spiritual awareness, their own knowledge of the horrible end th at they will be suffering motivates them to try to corral the rest of humanity towards the same destiny of perdition - the crude calculation being,"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"678 A DDENDUM 2: The Death Education Agenda believe it or not, that they will be 'less lonely'. Among the Illuminati, those who practice witchcraft, and the Freemasons, an even more ludicrous delusion pr evails: the idiotic lie of reincarnation. This is one of the Evil One's most egregious and fantastic deceptions - the idea that when we die, we are sure to return as someone else, later. The supposedly illuminated ones (who are guided by the false 'light' of the Prince of Darkness), and who specialise in lies for consumption by their 'brethren', actually believe this Satanic lie themselves. In the meantime, their cadres are hyperactively seeking to corrupt our children, both to enlarge the population of occultists and the numbers of young ones available for molestation, and the overall scope of the kingdom of darkness - and to alleviate the dull, perpetual discomfort they feel as they waste their own lives in the byways of darkness, seeking by all means known to their masters, to destab ilise and wreck the lives of the next generation. In addition to which, the population of the United States alone is estimated to be some 50 million less than would be the case if abortion had not been legalised: in which case, open-ended immigration and the mixing up of the races on today's scale there, would never have become 'economically necessary'. This Author belonged to the generation - probably the last generation - to have been taught, in his earliest years, from childhood books th at rejoiced in beautiful things, bo th physical and spiritual, one of which contained the following litt le poem, read to us by our beloved Australi an child minder: 'If Jesus came to my house And knocked upon the door I'm sure I'd be more happy than I've ever been before'. This reflects the words of Jesus: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, an d will sup with him, and he with me' 4 . How can our little ones open the door the Him, and en joy 'the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him' 5 , when their false, deceitful teachers feed them the spiritual food of Lucifer? Given this abomination of desolati on, it is amazing how many of our beautiful children somehow emerge relatively unscathed from the Satanic onslaughts to which they are subjected nowadays fr om such a tender age, as a consequence of the temporary hegemony of these hate merchants. ■ References and Notes: 1.

DR ALBERT HOFMANN, THE 'FATHER OF LSD' When Richard Cheney, the US Vice-President, needed to check into a hospital in Colorado, on 24th June 2005, he reportedly gave his name as Dr Hofm ann. This was no accident: Cheney was a llegedly in charge of the CIA's MK- ULTRA mind- and personality-control and behaviour modification program and/or its successor(s) at one stage of his long intelligence career. So his choice of name for hospita l check-in purposes was significant as all these high-level operatives are 'Dark Actors Playing Games', and this would have been considered a dark joke, as well as having another connotation - which might have been that the Vice-Pre sident was not ill at all, but that 'Red Alert' conditions suddenly necessitated that he check into hospital. This is an old intelligence community tri ck: when in danger, you check yourself into a hospital (although the Author woul d have thought that given the reputation of certain US hospitals for not curing, but de liberately worsening, the physic al condition of targeted perso nnel, this might not always be a sensible move). The real Dr Hofmann was 37 years old when, on 16th April 19 43, in the laboratories of Sandoz in Basle, he was conducting research into the properties of rye fungus, in a search for a cure for migraine. In the afternoon, he began to feel peculiar, and went home to lie down. 'With eyes cl osed', he wrote, 'I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, ka leidoscopic play of colours'. Unwittingly, Dr Hofmann had taken the first-ever acid trip - having synthesised lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from the fungus, and had absorbed the drug through his fingertips. Cheney's choi ce of the name of the scientist who discovered this hallucinogen reveals that his hospital visit was an illusion. It was arranged in order to provide a ve nue for certain top- level secret discussions, given the presence of key intelligence cadres in Colorado. ■"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 679 ADDENDUM THREE: International Cu rrency Review 30,1: July 2004 CERBERUS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT A HEDGE FUND NAMED AFTER THE GUARD-DOG OF HADES The Editor/Author was happily perusing his favourite newspaper, 'Nihon Keizai Shimbun' [12th July 2004] when his eye alighted upon an interview with Dan Quay le, the former Bush I era Vice President. What was the man who notoriously spelled 'potato' with an 'e' doing featured in this respected organ of Japanese business? The answer surprised us (momentarily), and may surprise you, too. Dan Quayle, it transpires, is the 'sh ill' (front man) for yet another US international investment entity calling itself Cerberus Global Investments LLC. Accordi ng to Mr Quayle, as cited by the Japanese paper, Cerberus has invested $7.0 billion in the Japanese economy over the past seven years, and has 'a long-term commitment to Japan'. The former Vice President added: 'People were sceptical several years ago when I said that. Now they firmly believe it. Because we are still here and we are going to continue to be here'. Leaving aside the implication that su ch investment firms 'come and go', it further transpires that Cerberus had acquired a 61% stake in the Aozora Bank, presid ed over by Hirokazu Mizukami, who was formerly with the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation. At a shareholders' meeting held in Tokyo on 29th June 2004, several new directors were appointed, as a result of which Americ ans and other non-Japanese executives gained a majority of the seats on the Bo ard. Among these are Lawrence Lindsay, President Bush It's former Chief Economic Adviser (who left the Whit e House in tandem, more or less, with the former US Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, whose experien ces and sceptical observations were the subject of a biography by Ron Suskind: see Figure 94 page 607). 'We have six official Board Meetings a year - five in Tokyo and one in New York', added Mr Quayle help fully. So these board meetings are his 'cover' for frequent visits to Japan. Mr Quayle, the 44th US Vice President, comes from Indiana, having graduated from Huntington High School in 1965, after which he attended the obscure DePauw University. In July 1971, Dan Quayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Di vision of the Indiana Attorney General's Office. But his time beating the streets didn't last long: within months, he was an administrative assistant to the Indiana Governor du jour, Edgar Whitcomb. In 1973-74, he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. He also served in the Indiana National Guard, during which time he earned a law degree at Indiana University. Af ter receiving his degree in 1974, Mr Quayle worked as an associate publisher of his family's local newspa per, The Huntington Herald-Press', and practiced law with his wife in Huntington. It is interesting to note that this city was, at the time, and has reportedly remained, a notorious centre of occu lt activity and Satanism. In 1976, Dan Quayle was elected for the Fourth Congressional District of Indiana to the US Congress. He won re-election in 1978 by the largest percentage margin ev er achieved to that date in that district. In 1980, aged just 33, Mr Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the US Senate from the State of Indiana. He was re-elected in 1986. At the Republican Nationa l Convention in New Orleans (August 1988), George H. W Bush (Sr.) called upon Mr Quayle to become his Vi ce Presidential candidate. It is believed that his electoral success, record and photogenic popularity helped Mr Bush Sr. to win the election, having at the time of the Convention been traili ng 15 points behind the Democrats, according to opinion polls taken prior to the Convention. Throughout his time as Vice Presiden t, Mr Quayle was widely ridiculed by the media and some of the general public as a mental lightweight who was prone to verbal gaffes (as was and are George Bush Sr. and Jr.), reflecting (we suspect) the fact that such operatives reach high status only after MK-Ultra-type mind-manipulation. The most notorious of these gaffes was Mr Quayle's correction of a pupil's spelling of potato, to read potatoe, at an elementary school sp elling lesson in Trenton, NJ, on 15tn June 1992. When this story is related, it is usually omitted that Mr Quayle was relying upon a spelling card on which the word had been (deliberately?) misspelled by the semi-literate teacher. Another remark that has been attributed to the former Veep is that, when he heard that he was required to travel to Latin America, he exclaimed: 'I knew I should ha ve boned up on my Latin'. Dan Quayle is styled an 'adviser' to Cerberus Ca pital Management, according to biographies, whereas the Japanese paper and other sources refer to the company as Cerberus Global Investments LLC (as indicated). 'The Nation', of 3rd April 2003, described Cerberus Capital Management as 'a US investment fund that has spent more than $2.0 billion snatchin g up bankrupt Asian enterprises, and [that] recently opened a Washington office to invest in homeland security companies'."},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"680 A DDENDUM 3: Cerberus Capital Management Cerberus has been variously described as a 'vul ture fund' which specialises in acquiring near- bankrupt companies, and the 12th-largest hedge-fund management firm in the United States, with $9.0 billion worth of assets. It employs Quayle & Asso ciates, based in Scottsdale, AZ, through which the former US Vice President provides his advisory services. According to Craig Whitney, Executive Vice President of Quayle & Associates, Mr Quayle provides strategic advice to Cerberus 'and has the title of Chairman of Cerberus Global Investment s' ['Detroit Free Press', 23rd June 2004]. On 19th July 2004, the 'Sacrament o Business Journal' reported that GenCorp Inc., of Rancho Cordova, was selling its automobile parts business, GDX Automotive, to Cerber us Capital Ma nagement LP for $147 million in cash. The publication asserted that 'Cerberus is a hedge fund that has made or explored investments in a very wide variety of industries, fro m airlines and media to mobile homes and financial services. A 'Business Week' report last week called it the 12th-largest hedge fund and put its value at $9 billion' which we believe to be a gross underestimate. 'Some have char acterised the fund as a \"vulture capitalist\" for its penchant for swooping down upon distressed companies as investment opportunities. A judge overseeing the bankruptcy case of Air Canada ha s approved a plan for a unit of Cerberus to buy a 9% stake in the airline for $189 million, pending the approval of credito rs. Cerberus is also one of a cluster of investment groups said to be eyeing United Airlines'. The newspaper report continued: 'Cerberus is rumoured to be the investment company with which Lord (Conrad) Black is negotiating over the fate of Hollinger Inc., the Toronto-based ne wspaper company in which he owns a controlling interest'. ['Business Week' further reported that] 'Cerberus has been among the most active hedge funds in lobbying against new proposals to regulate the industry, including moves that would allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to review their investment strategies and check on whether they are following securities laws'. Cerberus was reported have hired the politically conn ected law firm of Patton Boggs LLP to lobby for it in Washington. 'Sacramento Business Journal' added th at 'Patton Boggs reportedly arranged a meeting held on 10th June between the Chairman of the Secu rities and Exchange Co mmission [SEC], William Donaldson, and former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is the chairman of the hedge fund's private- equity arm, Cerberus Global Investment'. A separate 'Business Week' report [of 19th July 2004] stated that 'Cerberus, with the help of Patton Boggs, even attempted to persuade the House Appropriations Committee to tie William Donaldson's hands completely' - a reference to the new rules which wo uld require the SEC to review all hedge funds' investment strategies and to evaluate th eir compliance with the SEC's regulations. It transpired that in June, Cerberus sought to have a restriction attached to the SEC's fiscal 2005 budget that would prevent the SEC from using tax dollars to enforce the intended new rules on hedge funds. The report noted that the US Senate Banking Committee Chairman, Richard C Shelby, had received $133,000 from hedge funds and their law firms 'in the cu rrent electoral cycle', at least $79,500 of it from Cerberus officials and their spouses. The report adde d that in mid-June, the House Financial Services Committee Chairman, Michael G. Oxley, whose committee oversees the SEC, 'got wind of the manoeuver and fired off a letter to the appropriations panel ar guing that it was not right to bypass him on such an important matter. The restriction wa s never formally proposed, but hedge funds may still try to block Donaldson when the Senate acts on the Commission's budget. Cerberus officials and Patton Boggs did not return repeated telephone calls asking for comment'. So what has been going on? PLACEMENT, AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED No-one ever asks what the original sources of these hedge funds' financial streams are. The question should always be asked: What is the source of funds? You will have noticed that any proposed 'regulation' of the funds that has been mooted would not ask that question, either. All the SEC appears to be concerned about is whether investors in these funds use accepta ble strategies, and whether SEC rules are adhered to. Even so, it might be most uncomfortable to have US officials crawling all over the books. Suppose the sources of investment flows-of-funds may, sha ll we say, be of an 'unsavoury nature'. If that were so, then the main consideration governing their management would be placement, not the rate of return. Hence the quality of a given asset would matter less than the 'investment opportunity' itself. The problem facing controllers, e.g., of drug proceeds, is always how to launder the cash as fast as possible. If we were talking about the placement of underworld flows, then Cerberus would be the perfect name for a conduit suitable for such a purpose. For Cerberus was the monstrous watch-dog with 50 heads and a voice of bronze (that is to say, a voice like one who is possessed with devils) who guarded the hideous gate of the Kingdom of Hades, in Greek mythology.

The truly unprecedented uncertainty into which the whole world has been thrown by developments in the United States, and by the conversion of Britain and America into disturbers of the global peace in stark contrast to the previously received international perception of these two leading nations as paragons of 'democratic virtue', is further exacerbated by controversy surroun ding the character of the President of the United States himself. Since your correspondent has the highest regard for the intuitive capabilities of certain women, it is appropriate here to record that wh en George W. Bush Jr. was first 'e lected', a married female American friend of the Editor expressed extr eme dismay and concern, notwithst anding her Republican and Texan roots, indicating her fear that Mr Bush may turn out to be dangerous, or worse. Your correspondent had earlier been impressed by Laura Bush's statement in a pre-election interview in which she had been asked about her husband's 'religion', that 'in 1988 a friend gave him a 'One-Year Bible' (viz., a Bible in which the readings are divided into 365 sessions, one for each day of the year) 'and he has been reading it ever since'. Given the gross, pagan debauchery characteristic of the Clinton period, this seemed to your correspondent to represent a considerable improvemen t. However it appears that the Editor's friend was much more perceptive. Work on George W. Bush's personality and psychological make-up has been carri ed out remotely by an American psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, Dr Justin A. Frank, and presented in his book, published many months prior to the 2004 Presidential Election, 'Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President' [Regan Books, New York, NY 2004]. Dr Frank's careful and candid analysis of the President's mind concludes that this man displays and has exerted an innate ab ility and tendency 'to exert his destructive power on the world', and that he may turn out to be extremely dangerous. THE PRESIDENT'S ALLEGED INTERNAL CONFLICTS Dr Frank interprets Bush's mentality by reference to an endless internal battle that he perceives the President endures trying to cope with his anxieties. The author is not a Christian: in fact it is clear that he is, as one might expect, an atheist. He therefore excludes altogether any reference to possible occult influences in this President's life - a serious omission, given that open reports indicate that they may permeate the family from which he sprang. The gravity of this omission is all the more seriou s given allegations that George W. Bush Jr. was allegedly present at an occultic event years ago at which a number of the participants lost their lives. Nor is there any reference in this work to voluminous evid ence of alleged criminal wrongdoing by members of this powerful family, let alone to wide ly alleged paedophilia and homosexuality. Among the characteristics of this nevertheless engaging President's b ackground and psychological make-up which Dr Frank highlights, are these: • The influence of the privileged, secretive family into which he was born, and its decisive impact on his view of the world, including a very simplistic Ariosophist division of the world into good and evil. • The lasting influence that early fantasies and hurt feelings may have had on his precepts. • The prevalence of aggressive tendencies, and the sometimes sadistic ways they are unfortunately expressed in his behaviour. • His attempts to seek escape from his internal tu rmoil through substance abus e (mainly alcohol in the past), exercise and pre-packaged 'religion'. • His relationships with authority figures, both individual and institutional. • Impaired abilities to mourn, to admit responsibility and to know himself, all of which Dr Frank says are necessary for psychological growth. • His unwillingness to be, let alone to admit to being wrong, or to consider divergent perspectives. • Inconsistencies between his words and actions. • Inconsistencies between his words and truth. President Bush seems to recognise that he is an oddity, as he is on record as having remarked: 'Don't spend a lot of time trying to figure me out... I'm just not into psychobabble'. Much the most commendable characteristic of Dr Frank's book, however, is the clarity of the plain English in which it is written, and thus the absence of psychobabble, which makes it instantly accessible."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"682 A DDENDUM 4: Bush on the Couch THE EARLY BEREAVEMENT Indicative of George W. Bush's impaired psychologic al background is what happened after George, who was the eldest child, discovered retrospectively that his little sister, Robin, who had been diagnosed with leukaemia in the spring of 1953, had died. Unaware that Robin was ill, he was simply ordered not to play with the sister to whom he had become close, on her occasional visits home from long, unexplained absences. After Robin had died in New York in October 1953, her parents spent the next day golfing in Rye, and then returned to Houston. Ther e was never any 'closure' for George Bush. Mrs Barbara Bush has evidently written revealingly about her experiences as both a mother and a child, so that Dr Frank possessed ample information about he r history. Referred to by her offspring as 'the Enforcer', Barbara Bush has by her own admission always been the family disciplinarian. Called \"the one who instills fear\" by a close family friend, she woul d boldly break up fights between her sons, \"bust them up and slap them around\", accord ing to a brother-in-law. In later years, Mrs Bush has not lost her willingness to display her own aggressive tendencies before the whole world. For instance, many observers, including Dr Frank, were stunned when she told viewers during an interview in 2004 on the prime-time US TV show 'Larry King Live' that 'you can criticise me, but don't criticise my children and don't criticise my daughters-in- law and don't criticise my husband, or you're dead'. Sensitive US observers whom we respect most, and your correspondent himself, did not believe this outburst to be a mere figure of speech. In Britain, it is a criminal offence to utter threats. Apparently this is not the case in the United States - a fact which illustra tes a telling distinction between the two civilisations. (We all thought she really meant it). The author reveal s that Mrs Bush was herself treated harshly by her 'striking beauty' of a mother, who paid little atten tion to the normal aspects of maternal life associated with traditional nurturing. The impression gained is that of distance between mother and daughter, a condition that Mrs Bush clearly passed on in her own family. (There is evidence that Barbara Bush may be the illegitimate daughter of Aleister Crowley, as not only is her physical resemblance to Crowley striking, but her wayward mother is known to have strayed from the family home and stayed with that ogre in France. This would explain the \"cold blood\" in her veins). A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT GEORGE W. BUSH Dr Frank relieves all the initial gloom by observing that 'there's a lot to like about George W. Bush. Even his detractors during the 2000 campaign praised his humour, humility and general affability. His playful friendliness and informality have often disarmed his many critics and charmed the media; he winks and kids around, jokes with reporters on the campaign trail, and peppers his unprepared remarks with great humour'. The psychoanalyst's own researches suggest that children who lose a sibling may react by taking it upon themselves to cheer up their grievi ng mother, whose hair turned white during the years after the loss of Robin, and whose pain at the child's loss, Dr Frank believes, was conveyed in spades to George through a stern, restricting facial expression. George Bush Jr. was known as 'Bushtail', always on the go - a condition that today would arouse suspicions of hyperactivity. This ma y have reflected, in part, the child's need to externalise his own unintegrated anxieties. 'Com plex thinking cannot take place if the ch ild is unable to regulate his feelings. The child [who is] consumed by negative feelings, or distracted by the enormous effort required to handle them with merely primitive psychological tools, ca n't get beyond his desperate need to manage his unmanageable anxiety; thus overwhelmed, the child may experience any external input as excessive. The premium placed on internal order may thus leave no room for growth'. Attention Deficit Hy peractivity Disorder (ADHD) ranks to day as the most common neurobehav- ioural childhood disorder, according to the American Academy of Paediatrics. Dr Frank noted 'that much of what we know of the adult Bush's work habits a nd mental practices conforms to various indicators of ADHD. The two worst problems fo r adults with this condition are impulsiveness and craving. 'Impulsive behaviour is often mistak en for decisiveness, but in reality the quick decision is often made because the individual is too impatient to sustain his attention long enough to read all the information, or else too uncomfortable at the prospect of complex th ought to weigh things sufficiently. A 'U.S. News and World Report' mentioned Mr Bush's aides during his firs t term as saying that he 'never agonises over decisions, preferring to gather informa tion, make a decision, and move on'. The psychoanalyst notes that the President 'is known for keeping a strictly regimented daily routine, in which short, heavily scheduled workdays with brief mee tings are punctuated by regular breaks for exercise. Some would praise this as eviden ce of a disciplined mind, but it points equally to a desire to minimise the impact of a short attention span, and to avoid the impulsive behavior that can otherwise result. As the commentators Eric Alterman and Mark Green have both reported, Mr Bush's 'advisors have admitted that the staff usually limits him to just three or four 30- to 45-minute 'policy time' sessions per week, about what Bill C linton engaged in per day. Then, more often than not, the President sloughs off responsibility with the admonishment, \"You guys decide it'\"."},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 683 STICKING OUT HIS TONGUE The book has a mass of revealing information about Bush's impulsive behaviour. As Governor of Texas, having summoned a Forestry Service official to the podium to talk about forest fires by shouting 'Tree man, get up here!', Bush looked round at the journalists while he talked, 'stuck out his tongue and made a funny face by puffing up his cheeks like a blowfish'. The author points out that such impulsive, hair-trigger responses to real and perceived threats are comm on with people with ADHD, who often act before determining whether the threat they perceive is in fact genuine. They also tend to do the opposite - responding to feeling threatened by choosing to hide or to escape. Thus Bush dabbled in many things before arriving at Harvard Business School, by which time he 'had a taste of many different jobs but none of them ever seemed to fit'. In his examination of the President's personality, the author stresses that his be haviour is highly relevant because of the political ramifications - which, we would add, the whole world is about to see. 'His defensive measures not only reflect c onflicts within his character; they can also cause serious problems that can have a severe impact on the quality of his leadership - and on the quality of our lives'. People who have known Mr Bush in the pa st have often said that while he appeared to be affable, in fact his affability hides a distance. 'As an intelligent person whose access to his intelligence was hampered by disabilities, Bush compensated for his flaws by developing other talents, such as his sense of humor and his uncanny ability to memorize names and faces. People with un treated ADHD can have difficulty functioning as members of a social group, because they find it hard to follow substantive discussion and social interaction', as Mr Bush's first Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, discovered whenever he appeared for his weekly briefings with the President. Mr O'Neill noticed at once that Mr Bush was not in the slightest interested in anything he had to say, and that he suffered from EGO (Eyes Glaze Over) thr oughout their meetings. Thanks to the diligence of Dr Frank, we now know that Mr O'Neill's experiences with the President reflected Mr Bush's short attention- span associated with his ADHD. The author elaborates: 'Finding it too hard to grasp though ts coming from multiple directions', ADHD su fferers 'often resort to telling jokes and disrupting the proceedings; they content themselves with being one of a group of fun-loving people, and avoid more serious interaction'. So, as a consequence, Paul ONiell was asked in December 2002 to 'activate' the presigned resignation letter which every high office-holder in the United States is required to sign as a condition of his appointment. An ambitious child with ADHD has to be a leader in order to be a group member, otherwise he can't be heard, since in a subordinate position no-one would take his outbursts seriously. And indeed, with this man, they need to. Sometimes, it appears that it is not George W. Bush, but something else that is speaking. For instance, on 11th May 2001, he pronounced in Washington that 'there's no question that the minute I got elected, the storm clouds on the hori zon were getting nearly directly overhead'. The Author would agree. And on 13th August 2002, speaking at Waco, Texas, Mr George Bush Jr. remarked:' T firmly believe the death tax is good for people from all walks of life throughout our society'. Reverting to the child-rearing dimension of nis stud ies, Dr Frank speaks of the importance of the breaking and repairing of bonds, which is an essential and normal component of child rearing. 'In healthy relationships, a patter n is established where the mother understands the pain and shame she has caused, helping the child to regulate his own feelin gs over time. But hyperactivity can get in the way of this process. Bush's attitudes suggests that his childhood involved little experience of breaking and repairing; his inability to express contrition, or admit wrongdoing, bespeaks a profound need to deny the possibility of his shame'. The basic rhythm of 'breaking and repairing' also teaches the child that a negative experience can be followed by something positive; in the process, the chil d learns to tolerate the bad without having to react violently. But, says Dr Frank ominously, 'this also seems to be missing from Mr Bush's repertoire. When a child doesn't experience relief from his distress, he fr equently reacts by defiantl y denying outside help or influence, developing a false, grandiose sense of independence'. GRANDIOSITY AND CARDBOARD FIGURES Enter the condition of grandiosity which, along with shame, Dr Frank says are symptoms of the learning- disabled person's inability to construct an internal world that reflects the complexities of life. 'Such a child's inner world must be simple, because complexity cause s anxiety; when shame is unresolved, compensatory grandiose self-images are allowed to thrive, and magica l thinking spawns unrealistic notions that flourish unchallenged'. Accordingly the material world is simplified to conform to the person's internal worldview. This oversimplified grasp of reality implies that th e President's world is popul ated by cardboard figures who are either enemies or friends ('doing a good job'). Bush's notorious references to GRU-President Putin - a ruthless military intelligence office r - have been alarming. Specifically, the Pres-"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"684 A DDENDUM 4: Bush on the Couch ident said that he had seen into Putin's soul when lo oking into his eyes, as a result of which experience his impression of Putin was positive. However anyone looking into Putin's soul had better beware; and looking into his eyes would probably be ill-advised, as well. Bush wrapped up this assessment by asserting that Putin was 'willing to wear a cross', the implication being that this covert Leninist liar must be a 'good ma n' if he's wearing a cross. In fact, wearing crosses is one of the more grotesque mini-deceptions perpetrate d by the covert Soviet Leninists who have been masquerading as 'reformed' characters these past 15 years. Thus the late Raisa Gorbachev wore a very large cross, even though she and her husband were professed agnostics, and Gorbachev is a Jew with a family name of Orbach or Korbach. Stalin II, as MVD Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet gauleiter of Georgia, was referred to, had himself christened 'St George', for some reason no-one could ever fathom. The false churchman doing the 'christening' was the Catholic os-Patriarch Ilya II of Georgia, who has been a prominent KGB operative since 1962. An alarming corollary to Mr Bush's habit of gro ss oversimplification when judging between 'enemies' and 'friends' is that this characteristic was integral with the Ariosophical outlook which formed a key component of the psychological environment within whic h Nazism took root and thrived. Hitler's early years in Vienna were disturbed by his dislike of the chaotic polyglot capital city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where so many minorities and Jews cohabited. The antithesis to that thesis was the 'pure Aryan' Germany across the border. President George W. Bush has demonised the Iranian Islamic regime, which is [as was the case at the time] controlled by an Azerbaijani (President Khatami), mas querading as an Iranian, just as Tehran has demonised the United States as 'the great Satan'. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, may die as a consequence of these dangerous ove rsimplifications. THE FORMER ALCOHOLIC Dr Frank next tackles the question of Bush's 'former' alcoholism, beginning with the question: is he still drinking? The author is uncertain about this, noting a number of occasions when the President's speech has sounded slow and excessively deliberate, in the way that certain secret drin kers sometimes talk to hide their inebriation. Just before the start of the Iraq War, Tom Shales wrote in The Washington Post', astonishingly, that 'the President may have been ev er so slightly inebriated'. On other occasions, the President appears to have made up stuff (confabulation); and exampl es are mentioned. Confabulation 'is a common phenomenon among drinkers, as is perseveration, which is evident in Bush's tendency to repeat key words and phrases, as if the repetition helps him to keep calm and stay on track'. On balance, however, Dr Frank comes to the conclusion that President Bush is what is known in his trade as a 'dry drunk' - someone whose alcoholism has not been treated, but has been supplanted by another addiction. Dr Frank asserts that in President Bush's case the 'replacemenf addiction is 'religion', which Mr Bush 'got' after a walk with the 'Rev' Billy Graham (allegedly a 33rd Degree Mason!) on the beach at Kennebunkport in 1985. Whether this 'conversion' has any basis in reality we strongly question. Evangelism is ngt the way to find Christ. The Billy Graham way of suddenly committing oneself to Jesus Christ has been found to be almost wholly useless: apparently less than 5% of those who 'choose for Chrisf at Billy Graham-type sessions, remain committed in their new faith. True commitment comes though Fait h, leading to Grace, which in turn leads to the reading of Scripture and thence changes in attitude and way of life. In Mr Bush's case, it is much more likely that th e 'born-again' religion that he supposedly clings to represents the replacement addiction for his alcoholism. The fact that as Governor he presided over more executions than any other Governor in US history is entirely inconsistent with True Christianity, even though Texans often justify this behaviour as being authorised by the Old Testament. But in reality, the Old Testament was torn up when the veil of the Temple was rent in twain, and was replaced by the New Testament, or Will - which no more sanctions the ta king of human life than do the Ten Commandments. Under any circumstances. On the other hand, there is nothing inherently unnatural about Mr Bush's reported reliance on his faith for 'protection'. According to the atheist Dr Frank, 'the faith that comes from identification with an omnipotent figure restores a sense of inner peace, protecting the believer from feelings of helplessness or powerlessness'. This cynical observation is included here merely becau se it forms part of Dr Frank's diagnosis: as an atheist, he has, of course, no knowl edge of 'the peace of God which pass eth all understanding' [Philipp-ians Chapter 4, verse 7]. In this crucial respect, his analysis fails to encapsulate or to reveal the full truth about George W Bush and his background. Thus, Dr Frank's refusal to take account of the spiritual dimension ensures that he overlooks the crucial influe nce of Skull and Bones upon the menta lity and inner makeup of all the key Bush males. Given that the Senior Year for 'Bonesmen' consists primarily of a crash course of indoctrination into Luciferianism, risking infestation or possession, this is a serious omission."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 685 TERRORISM - THE REVOLUTIONARY ALIBI The world of invisible terrorist threats, from a cyni cal, bogus international intelligence fabrication called Al-Qaeda, lends itself to the kind of grotesque mental oversimplifica tion which Dr Frank diagnoses as characteristic of the President's mentality. It doesn't matter who the enemy is - the 'former' CIA operative 'Tim Osman' morphed into Osama Bin Laden, the sp ooky scourge of humanity posing in a bathrobe and a beard whose appearance in planted vi deos made, it is alleged, in Las Vegas, is reiterated whenever the scareism propaganda needs to be ratcheted up to mask a particular nasty incident associated with the global gang warfare called the intensified intelligence war; or Saddam Hussein; or terrorists in general. No matter, Mr Bush Jr. is enabled by his faith to see himself as the force of light against darkness. The problem with this chronic delusion is that the President presides over a regime of pitch darkness, elements of which are re-exposed in this presentation. No-one who has been exposed to the swirling lies, evasions, barrages of di versionary \"lines\" and disinformation surrounding 9/11 and the 'war on terrorism' - which was being 'waged' internationally three decades and more ago, after the Soviets relaunched the global terrorism dimension of the World Revolution - believes a word that the US authorities have ever said about Osama Bin Laden. The President no longer mentions him, of course, because, as Michael Ruppert, a US police and intelligence investigator and author, says, in his book 'Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire and the End of the Age of Oil' [New Society Publishers, Gavriola Islands, BC, Canada, 2004, ISBN 0- 86571-540-8], 'Bin Laden was, and remains, a CIA/US Government/Wall Street a sset. That would explain why he has never been caught. There are still wars to fight'. 'He can't be caught for a variety of other reason s, including his family's enormous and diverse financial connections to the same elites that contro l the United States' financial system, and his close interrelationship with a Saudi ruling class that could pull the plug on the US economy.... Osama Bin Laden also knows way too much, and without him, the Bush Administration would have had no excuse for any of what it has done over the la st four years. From a strategic poin t of view, Osama is Dick Cheney's best friend'. Some 40,000 people did not turn up for work at th e World Trade Center on 11th September 2001, unless far more people lost their lives (were sacrif iced) than we have been told. Your correspondent discovered in late October 2001 that the smell of ro tting flesh was nauseating even as far away as our Midtown Manhattan offices, so there remains a suspici on in his mind that the numbers actually murdered were far larger than reported. Our attempts to obtain a list of the tenants of the Twin Towers from their owners, Silverstein Properties, were unproductive. And did you know that the damage inflicted internally at the World Trade Center in 1993, when th e first 'Reichstag Fire' operation at the huge office complex was attempted, was never repaired? On the contrary, the da maged basement area was left unattended, placed out of bounds by a police cordon. Someone had evidently decided that it would be a waste of money to repair the area. We wonder why. It is extraordinary (though typical of al l US political scandals) that the perpetrators of this 'Reichstag Fire' even t have succeeded, with impunity, in orch estrating the presentation of events so confusingly, and despite so many 'smoking gun' cl ues that there was inside official complicity. NEW LIES FOR OLD: SCIONS OF THE LAW WHO THINK THEY TRANSCEND IT So far. We need not reiterate here the wealth of ope n information about the large Bush family's allegedly 'dodgy' background. Dr Frank covers this point well in a single sentence (although he does nave much more to say on this subject): 'Bush was bom into a family that was simultaneously of the law and above it, steadily accruing power to legislate even as its actions moved further from the law'. And the family's true attitude to opposition was encapsulated in the threat uttered by Mrs Barbara Bush during that notorious televised interview on 'Larry King Live'. Innumerable works have been published which explore the Bush 'crime' fa mily's background. But the US historian Kevin Phillips has summarised all this in his book 'American Dynasty', described by Dr Frank as 'a damning and invaluable historic al look at the familial influences on our President's psyche'. 'Four generations of building to wards dynasty', Mr Phillips observes, 'have infused the Bush family's hunger for power and practices of crony capitalism with a moral arrogance and backstage disregard for the democratic and republican traditions of the US Governme nt'. Well, of course: if one's primary preoccupation as an alleged hyperactive serial criminalist, apart from the further accumulation of wealth, may be to guarantee one's own protection against arrest, indictment and disgrace, who cares a bout the United States' traditions or the Constitution? Several authors have concentrated on this President's inability to distinguish fact from fiction, i.e. his propensity to lie, which has been reviewed in a number of recent books. David Corn (who may be an intelligence operative, representing here an anti-Bush faction), the author of one of them, 'The Lies of George W. Bush', writes thus: 'So constant is [Mr Bush's] fibbing, that a history of his lies offers a"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"686 A DDENDUM 4: Bush on the Couch close approximation of the history of his Presidential tenure'. Mr Corn says that the President's tendency to be 'economical with the truth' is or was masked by the 'honest-man routine' which characterised his election campaign in 2000: but 'a candidate who ri ses to power by denouncing the lies of others, warrants more attention when he hims elf engages in dishonest behavior'. [Author This is 'rich', coming from an alleged intelligence operative whose own background in US intelligence will have been dominated by the culture of lying which is at the root of all the United States' myriad problems. Moreover all CIA operatives know perfec tly well that occupants of the highest positions are controlled operatives, with intelligence handlers who tell them what to do, and what lies to disseminate, and when. President Bush Jr has been observed listening to his handler speaking into a hidden micro-microphone, or reading prompt cards prepared by his handlers]. When Dr Frank looks into this dimension of the Pr esident's behaviour, we discover something else disturbing; that he evidently doesn't care -just as he doesn't care about the [now 650,000] Iraqi dead, the untold numbers of dead Afghanis, and the 150+ Texans for whose executions he is responsible. 'The ease and frequency with which Bush misrepresents the truth', writes Dr Frank, 'gain new resonance when seen in the context of a personality that considers itself exempt from the laws that govern others. Why doesn't he tell the truth? Because he doesn't have to. Mr Bush gets away with lying not because he is good at it - he's not - but because in his formulation there's nothing to get away with: the laws of accuracy mean little or nothing to him'. In this respect, there is of course little to choos e in this respect between the lying former President Clinton - his fellow 'Box Gang' operative - and George Jr. But it gets worse: 'In this light, his simplified worldview is especially important. His capacity to identify and convey the truth relies upon a mental a pparatus so primitive and misguided that he may well be unable to recognize his li mitations and mistakes. Though there's no way of knowing for sure - even for him - we have seen enough of his personality to su spect that he may actually believe many of his own dubious claims; encumbered by a self-serving, unde rdeveloped way of seeing the world, he simply lacks the tools to differentiate telling lies from speaking the truth'. Or, in other words, he 'can't help if. The analysis then considers some of the large litany of instances in which President Bush has defied the authority of truth. The author cited the instance of his military service and his profitable sale of Harken Energy stock in 1990, allegedly with the benefit of insider information. 'He compounded his dishonesty by offering conflicting expl anations and ultimately misrepresenting the conclusion of his run-in with authority, daiming to have been exonerated in correspondence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that specifically said this was not the case'. The technique of offering a large number of conflicti ng explanations to explain an act of wrongdoing appears to have been learned from his own father, George Bush Sr. According to analysts, Mr Bush Sr. used this device following the 'Odober Surprise' operation, under which the Iranians accepted $35 million in bribes (after some $27 million of the CIA's br ibery cash had been stolen by US actives engaged in the scam) in exchange for their agreement not to release the 52 American hostages captured in Teh ran on 4th November 1979 until after the US Presidential Election scheduled for exactly one year later (4th November 1980) - in order to guarantee the humiliati on and defeat of the then-Democratic President Jimmy Carter, and the vidory of Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. The analysts say that Bush Sr. had, by August 2003, offered as many as seven different and conflicting explanations as to where he was during a 'missing' 18-hour period, when he was flown to Paris for the negotiations and returned by supersonic aircraft to the United States before his absence could be noticed (which, however, it was). INFLICTING PAIN WITHOUT FLINCHING In a terrifying chapter called 'The Smirk', Dr Frank e xposes the President's sadism. 'Long before he led our nation into war, George W. Bush exhibited an appetite for destruction. As a child, Bush inserted firecrackers into the bodies of frogs, lighting the fuses and blowing the creatures up. As President of his fraternity at Yale, he used a brandi ng iron to maim young pledges'. This was, in fad, a reference to the fad that initiates of the occult secret sode ty Skull and Bones at Yale are branded in the small of the back with the letter 'D', which stands inter alia for the Greek o ccultist Demosthenes, who committed suidde at an altar there in 322 BC (322 being of course the occult ka bbalistic number of Skull and Bones - as well as (significantly) the area code for Brussels, the financ ial seat of the Illuminati, and the home of its invention, the European Union Collective, cont rolled by the German Nazi Continuum -Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, Dachau. The Author holds financial several transaction documentary records for the Illuminati which are distinguished by codes that include the numerals 322. Bush Jr. charaderised the hazing operation of 'bra nding each initiate just above and in between the buttocks [sic] with the red-hot tip of a wire coathanger' as equivalent to 'only a cigarette burn'."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 687 Dr Frank's findings on this score can be summarised as follows: 'As the Governor of Texas, he was observed smirking over the executions of death-row inmates, many of whom were later found to have received inadequate legal protection'. 'Bush's tendencies toward sadism now play out on a bigger stage, with more resounding results. He orders bombings in Baghdad and proudly shows off the horrifying photographs of the bodies of Saddam's sons - almost daring the world to look away. He gets an even larger audience for the video footage of Saddam Hussein's humiliation in captivity, and then demonstrates a very personal sense of triumph at his capture, and glee at the prospect of his execution'. The US President's trademark smirk, writes Dr Frank, 'makes his sadism easy to spot. In the Presidential debate of 2000, he displayed pleasure at the prospect of three Texas criminals being put to death: 'Guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death'. This odious public remark, made wi thout flinching, further illuminates Mrs Barbara Bush's threat to Larry King, doesn't it? At once arrogant and coward ly, that comment, accompanied by the smirk, put the whole world on notice that the act of inflicting pain - and the 'good' fortune of having a job that allowed him to do so within the laws of the State - brou ght Governor Bush a certain pleasure that he was unable to prevent himself from expressing. Why then, has there been such surprise at the he inous atrocities perpetrated by CIA operatives and Agency contractors in Abu Ghraib (and in innumerable other locations in Afghanistan, Jordan and on the British territory of Diego Garcia), at the 650,000 deaths in Iraq [updated figure: as of October 2006, according to The Lancet] and at the craven, boastful brutality and barb arism of US forces, as they work overtime to make America more 'feared' around the world? The United States is led by a man who, like all Luciferians, is able to 'inflict pain without flinching', a man of fire and 'peak of anger'. Dr Frank's verdict is damning indeed: The Bush smirk conveys both the pleasure he derive s from inflicting pain, and the defense he mounts against the discovery of that pleasure - a disclosure of the sadistic impulse, and an attempt to deny the destructive self he cannot bear to acknowledge'. Dr Frank is fearful, and so is the Author, that this man could lead the world into the Third World War. He will, the psychoanalyst asserts, engage 'the nation both as agent and victim in a perilous psy-chodrama that rages far beyond his control'. THE MEANING OF HIS 'BUSHISMS': AN OEDIPUS WRECK As for Bush's 'Bushisms' - his convoluted misuse of language, his malapropisms - they can be and have been extensively mined for laughs: one can buy calendars with a Bushism a day for a few dollars. But Dr Frank says that his verbal gaffes and blunders are 'symptomatic of a patient in dire need of help'. Yet, as noted earlier, some of these verbal faux-pas seem to convey what the President actually means, as in: 'Security is the essential roadblock to achieving the road map to peace'; or: 'There's no doubt in my mind that we should allow the world's worst leaders to hold America hostage, to threaten our peace, to threaten our friends and allies with the world's worst weapons'; or: 'We need an energy bill mat encourages consumption'. To these Freudian slips the President adds other familiar verbal distortions - the bland repetition of phrases (as noted), techniques to deflect questions, evasive answers, the loss of coherence in tangential speech. Closer inspection 'reveals that Bush doesn't just struggle with language; he perverts it, in ways that reveal a capacity for indifference and contempt that reverberates far beyond the written word'. And he is not afraid of contradicting himself. On 13th September 2001, the President pronounced: 'The most important thing is for us to find Osama Bin Laden. If s our number one priority and we will not rest until we find him'. But six months later, on 13th Marc h 2002, after rather too many exposures leading to the general knowledge that Osama Bin Laden is none other than a 'former' CIA asset code-named 'Tim Osman', Mr Bush said: 'I don't know where he is. I have no idea and I really don't care. If s not that important. If s not our priority' Turning to the Presidenf s fraught and dangerous relationship with his father in a chapter headed 'Oedipus Wrecks', Dr Frank identified fear of Bush Sr. and his 'deep rivalrous and aggressive feelings towards his father' which are manifest in bullying, often with sarcasm. Without going into the details of this relationship here, the factor which we find by far the most alarming in this context is the younger Bush's competitiveness - his drive to win at any cost, and his eagerness to be centre stage (similarly to his equally dark accomplice, Tony Blair). The traditional oedipal dynamic involves the boy's desire to surpass his father in the eyes of his mother. Yet 'a man like George W Bush seeks his fath er's approval just as much as his defeat'. Elab- orating this analysis, Dr Justin Frank reaches the following alarming conclusion:"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"688 A DDENDUM 4: Bush on the Couch 'George W.'s oedipal aggression toward his father is heightened by a defensive hostility, rooted in his fear of being humiliated for needing his father's love and approval, that he directs elsewhere -often at the weak and needy, who remind him unconsciously of his own unacceptable needs [sic]. The result is an individual who is driven to impress, emulate, and outperform the father he unconsciously holds responsible for his own past and potential future humilia tion. At the same time, he is highly motivated to unleash his very considerable destructive resources upon symbolic reminders of his father's strength and his own weakness'. Reports of a rift between Sr. and Jr., evident from the sacking of ancien regime holdovers, bear this out (and have been corroborated since). NON-ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY The President told the (CIA-favoure d) investigative author Mr Bob Woodward that the US Presidency means that he is no longer accountable to anyone for his actions. No-one tells him what to do. He tells others what to do. Dr Frank attaches importance to the Presid ent's first speech to a joint session of Congress after 9/11, which began: 'Why do they hate us?', asking: 'W ho is Bush really talking about when he says 'they hate us'? The Professor comes up with a disturbing response to his own question: 'Given what we know about the inattentiveness of his parents - who the young 'Bushtail' understood to have rejected him - if s easy to see how this indifference could have been transposed in his mind into hatred, projecting his unrequited longi ng onto other targets'. In that first post-9/11 speech, too, Mr Bush spoke of 'sacrifice' - which meant not only the human sacrifice perpetrated on 9/11, and the sacrificing of so many young American lives that the funeral corteges into Arlington Cemetery continue from morning to night, with the newly dug graves now spreading out far beyond the area originally intended for them - but also sacrificing free speech: you're either with us or against us. This attitude reminds us of two young Americans we know who, before th e second Iraq war, proclaimed, perfectly seriously, and with great anger, that 'all Iraqis should be killed. Period'. The President's psychological makeup includes an in ability to accept responsib ility for his failures - his disregard of the law now, on a global, tragic scal e, for example; and its twin, an inability to make reparation for his gross mistakes. His reliance on binary thinking and his consequently limited view of the world impedes his ability to recognise the humanity of others, which in turn makes it easier to project negative attitudes onto them. This leads to a self-perpetuating cycle: once they ar e perceived as having negative attributes, it becomes even harder to feel sympathy for them; and so on. Accompanying this grim syndrome is the President's tendency to blame others for the damage he has done. He denies there is any damage for him to take responsibility for. He declared th e war ended while the death toll c ontinued mounting, and has since reached ghastly proportions. And listen to this: 'Unable to accept responsibility for his actions, he can neither learn from his mistakes nor avoid repeating them. Unable to repair, he can only break and deny'. Even more alarmingly, since the second Iraq war may be considered by the President to have been a form of revenge for the damage done to his family's reputation by the CIA operative William Clinton in 1992, Mr Bush may believe that revenge equates to reparation, even though the avenger's satisfactions are only temporary. But 'revenge is mine, sa ith the Lord': if the President were a Christian, he would know that policy and behaviour should never, ever be motivated by revenge. 'Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord' [Romans, Chapter 12, verse 19]. ALARMING DATA FROM MEDICAL RECORDS The President's medical records, reviewed by Dr Fra nk, also contain alarming signals. In the report on the President's summer physical in August 2003, a number of spider angiomas were reported to have been removed from his nose. Dr Frank elaborated that , even though there was no indication of liver damage, these are a legitimate source of concern since, while th ey can appear without any apparent cause, they are most often seen either in pregnancy or in ch ronic liver damage from excessive alcohol abuse. A second finding which troubled him is the President's low pulse rate of 35 to 45, which Dr Frank fears may be associated with a suppressed level of arousal to various visual stimuli. 'Hypoarousal is typical of antisocial personalities; unable to perceive accurately the world around them, whenever challenged or attacked, such people tend to ove rreact in violent ways. They [may] ignore facial and behavioral warning signs - and then exhibit rage reactions out of proportion to the particular insult', whether real or imagined. When we discussed the President's low pulse rate with a medically qualified expert, she replied, with considerable emphasis, that such a low pulse rate is 'extremely abnormal' and should indeed be a source of grave concern. A third physical characteristic that Dr Justin Frank takes seriously was"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 689 described by Mr Bush Jr. himself in his autobiography 'A Charge to Keep': 'Laura stays in her own space; I've always invaded other people's spaces, leaning into them, touching, hugging, getting close... I am in perpetual motion, I provoke people, confront them in a teasing way. I pick at a problem'. Commenting on this, Dr Frank writes: 'In a standard physical exam that serves as part of a proper psychodynamic formulation, such behavior would automatically raise the possibility of a neurological connection. Such impulsive dis- charges of energy can be seen as symptomatic of Tourette's Syndrome; the line between a mild case of Tourette's and ADHD can be a fine one, or the two may co exist. Most adults with Tourette's who present at clinics for treatment do so because of temper outbursts' - the kind of event with which the President's staffers, like [the former White House Chief of St aff] Andrew Card, are believed to be familiar. The President's extraordinary lack of curiosity may pa rtly explain some of his 'economies with the truth'. He said after 9/11 that he 'never saw any intelligence that indicated there was going to be an attack on America'. However the CIA were engaged in ten simulations of aircraft crashing into very tall buildings on the very day of the atrocities (raising the likelihood that the simulations were intended as one of the multiple covers for the resulting 'Reichstag Fire' event). At the sa me time, it is quite possible, according to Dr Frank, that Bush saw plenty of such intelligence, but th at it made no impression on him whatsoever. The other possibility, of course, is that he knew what the controlling intelligence services were planning. Paranoia is another characteristic identified in this President. His strict insistence on absolute loyalty, a demand described by Mr Paul O' Neill among others, suggests that hi s paranoia runs deep. 'President Bush's continued habit of seeing the world as peopled with threats... is so consistent and unmistakable that it can safely be described as paranoid'. And the disengagement that Bush so frequently exhibits is the typical escape of the paranoid ind- ividual. Bush's behaviour is what psychoanalysts call egosyntonic, which means that his actions -'the lies he tells and the hurt he inflicts on others - don't appear to cause him much anxiety'. Dr Frank also thinks that Mr Bush has spent his life in absolute denial of the many sources of his anxiety, and of his haunting fear of retribution. HIDING INSIDE THE PRESIDENCY, WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE SECRET SERVICE For Mr Bush, the Presidency is the perfect refuge: as President he [thinks he - Ed.] is in control of everything and [is] surrounded by people who will protect him' (unless a decision is taken by those who are really in control, to dispense with his services ). He is like many CEOs - functioning megalomaniacs who are typically driven to satisfy their grandiose needs through a string of business risks that eventually guarantee failure. In sum, this man is considered to be extremely dangerous, as Dr Frank's final words indicate: 'Our sole treatment option - for his benefit and fo r ours - is to remove President Bush from office. It's up to all of us - Congress, the media, and voters - to do so, before it is too late'. So, it's too late. The damage over which this man is liable to preside could range from the degradation of the dollar arising in the context of perceptions of hi s Administration's reckless ex cess spending, to a truly catastrophic series of miscalculations over Ira n, Syria and the 'former' Soviet Union. Don't forget mat President Bush has long since misjudged GRU-President Vladimir Putin, who controls him, according to a senior intelligence office r with whom the Editor held an extensive discussion in May 2004. After Mr Putin had left the President's ra nch at Crawford, Texas, on one occasion, Mr Bush suddenly exclaimed: 'I love him, actually'. Your co rrespondent formed the view that what Mr Bush Jr. actually meant by this was that he is absolutely terrified of GRU-President Vladimir Putin, but that what came out of his mouth was an inversion of this fear. What Putin really thinks of Bush Jr. is occasionall y revealed in off-the-cuff comments - which are always Leninist in character and always contain meanings of re levance to those whom Lenin called 'the interested'. A Reuters report dated 3rd December 2004 quoted Putin, speaking in New Delhi, as having accused the United States of pursuing a dictatorial foreign policy. 'Even if dictatorship is packaged in beautiful pseudo-democratic phraseology, it will not be able to solve systemic problems. It may even make them worse', said the GRU operative, with maximum cynicism, as pointedly as possible. As mentioned, only a few weeks earlier, Putin had told George W Bush in Chile that \"his (Putin's) goal is th e creation [at home] of a democratic style consistent with Russian history' [The New York Post', 21st November, page 9]. In both comments, Mr Putin was cunningly making it clear to Mr Bush that he knew th at both powers cynically promoted not democracy but 'democratism', but that he is scornful of Mr Bash's cons tant references to how he is bringing democracy' to the Iraqis (that is, to those who have not yet been killed). At all events, the key point is that George W. Bush has misjudged Putin, so that he may misjudge responses to an intended attack on Iran, Syria, or both, in accordance with the next steps outlined by"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"690 A DDENDUM 5: Corruption at Harvard that that manic geopolitician, Dr Zbigniew Brzezi nski in his book 'The Grand Chessboard: America's Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives' [1997, Basic Books, New York], wherein it was catastroph-ically recommended that the United States should unilaterally redraw the map of the Middle East and Central Asia to suit its geopolitical and geo-energy interests. CONCLUSION If the President is insensitive to the consequences of his actions, this Administration will not only proliferate dangerous military adventures, but will overspend in every component of the budget, especially domestic 'security' and preparations for repression at home. One reason for this endemic free-spending attitude is that since senior officials are aware of the existence of colossal offshore-based financial resources controlled and accessible by the intelligence community, there is an official mindset which pays little attention to the formal budgetary numbers. The danger of this manifestation of arrogance is that the international financial markets, being in this respect less well informed than key US officials, w ill continue to adopt a different view. Obviously, with policy in the hands of a man diagnosed by one of the United States' most accomplished psychoanalysts as being as paranoid, unpredictable and dangerous as descri bed, it will be quite futile for analysts to expect that appropriate US financial housekeeping will occur during this troubling Presidency. In add ition, all the signs are that the Constitution may be abandoned. The outlook for the US dollar, therefore, could not possibly be bleaker, on the basis of the information elaborated in this section alone. The last time a crisis of these proportions overwhelmed a great nation was in January 1933. ■ ADDENDUM FIVE: Soviet Anal yst 27,2: Fe bruary 2001 CORRUPTION AT HARVARD UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, Vs. The President and Fellows of Harv ard College, Andrei Shleifer, Jonathan Hay, Nancy Zimmerman, and Elizabeth Hebert. On 26th September 2000, the US Department of Justice filed a civil Complaint against the President and Fellows of Harvard University, and against Professo r Andrei Shleifer, his wife Nancy Zimmerman, the University's Russian project manager Jonathan Ha y, and Hay's girlfriend-turned wife, Elizabeth Hebert. The suit sought damages of at least $40 million which the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) paid to Harvard University in connection with a (misguided) USAID-funded project in Russia. The comparatively modest size of this claim (when compared with the colossal proportions of the off-balance sheet transactions and the billions stolen by other US operatives and intermediaries,) does not make this case a minor one: on the contrary, the fact that the United States alleged that the President and Fellows of Harvard University, as well as the named Professor and individuals, were culpable, shows that there were no 'free-for-all' limits for the US and 'ex'-Soviet intelligence criminalist operatives alike. All Westerners who become involved with KGB and GRU officers trained to masquerade as as 'biznesmen' are vulnerable to being compromised. In this case, the President and Fellows of one of the world's most famous universities stand accused by the US Government of stealing a large sum of pub lic money due to their involvement in a misguided US official project designed to 'help the Russia ns' become integrated into the world community. Pathetically, none of the main 'players' in this fiasco, led by the US Government itself, has yet understood that such projects were always going to be a waste of time - since 'the General Staff of the Revolution', of which the KGB and GRU officers concerned are members, have an entirely different agenda which is hidden from the eyes of the West because it fell for the lies perpet rated during 1989-91. But even the remote chance that the Harvard project might achi eve some degree of 'transformation' in Russia was cancelled out from the start by the fact that the 'experts' employed by Harvard for this purpose saw their involvement not as a chance to wean the 'former' Soviet s from the path of corruption, but rather as a series of corruptly lucrative opportunities to enrich themselves personally, with all expenses being borne by the US Government. In 1992 and 1995, USATD and Harvard entered into two Cooperative Agreements which required the University to provide impartial and unbiased advice w ith respect to a USAID-funded project in Russia. The so-called Harvard Institute for International Development, now defunct, was used to implement Harvard's USATD project. The Civil Action (Number 00CV11977DPW) filed in the US District Court, District of Massachusetts, noted that the project included the provision of economic and legal advice"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 691 concerning the privatisation of Russia's national assets, and the creation of laws and institutions necessary for the functioning of open markets in Russia. Thus the US Government asked Harvard to undertake a task which was fundamentally impossible to achieve, since as noted the KGB and GRU officers into whose hands the assets of the revolutionary state were to be 'privatised' were working to a different remit - namely, to go through the motions of privatisation and establishing Western-style instit utions and the rule of law, all for the purposes of international public consumption - wh ile in practice presiding over a system of 'state- controlled capitalism' in accordance with Lenin's model. Underlying this stance was the objective everyone in the West seems to have missed, which is as follows. The 'former' Soviet Union is not engaged in 'convergence' towards the West. On the contrary, Leninist 'convergence' means that the West must 'c onverge' towards the East, and that the Easf s con- vergence towards the West is cosmetic only. In other words, the continuing Soviets are 'marking time' -until the West 'converges' with the East, on the Easf s te rms. In the European cont ext, this means waiting impatiently for the European Union Collective - which Gorbachev himself called 'the new European Sovief during a visit to London in March 2000 - to 'converg e' and expand Eastwards. The covert Soviets collaborate at the intelligence level with the Nazi Strategi c Continuum based at Dachau. There has been a complete failure to understand this revolutionary reality. And the biggest brains in the West, epitomised by Professors at Harvard University, have failed to analyse the situation objectively in the light of the history and objectives of Leninism. As a re sult, they fell prey to grandiose illusions about how Russia could be 'changed' in accordance with their academic preferences; while the blind US Government, basking in the glow of its illusory 'Cold War victory', supported these wishful-thinkers in the elaboration of their illusions - at the US taxpayers' expense. The US Civil Complaint against Harvard pointed ou t that 'to ensure that the advice provided by Harvard University was impartia l and unbiased, the Cooperative Agreements prohibited Harvard employees working on the project from making any investments in Russia'. Howe ver a US Congressional investigation into Harvard's activities had to be reassigned to the criminal section of the Boston US Attorney's office, after the staffers turned up disturbing evidence that the University and its staff had been in glaring breach of these requirements. Although the action finally announced was a civil one, the Complaint seems to imply criminal activity on the part of the defendants, noting that 'despite the clear terms of the agreements, Andrei Shleifer, a tenured Profe ssor in Harvard's Economics Department and Jonathan Hay, the University's Moscow-based Representative in charge of the USAID project, were making prohibited investments in Russia in the areas in which they were providing advice'. The complaint further alleged that Shleifer and Hay were using their positi ons, inside information and influence, as well as USAID-funded resources, to advance their own persona l business interests and investments and those of their wives and friends' (the Comp laint mentions 'girlfriends'). Commenting on the case, US Attorney Donald K. Ster n said that 'the United States paid Harvard for impartial and unbiased economic advi ce.... Despite clear prohibitions agai nst investing in Russia, Harvard advisors abused their positions and attempted to tip the playing field to their own private financial advantage. We hope that today's complaint will make clear that those who abuse the resources of the United States will be held accountable'. And that includes the President and Fellows of Harvard University, and their employees, who presided over gross abuses of the trust that the US Government had placed in them - thereby com- pounding the folly of the US Government itself, in rashly embarking upon this misguided project. THE DETAIL OF THE COMPLAINT The US Complaint alleged that while they were actin g on behalf of USAID, Shleifer, Hay, Zimmerman and Herbert engaged in various proh ibited investment s and businesses: • Shleifer and his wife Zimmerman invested and reinvested $200,000 through Renova-Invest, a US- Russian investment entity, in various Russian companies (all of which, given the system of 'state-controlled capitalism', were in fact in the hands of specially trained intelligence officers), including an aluminium company for which Hay and others funded by USAID provided legal services. Shleifer and Zimmerman also invested $60,000 through Renova-Invest, in Russian Government debt (GKOs). • Shleifer, Zimmerman and Hay bought several hund red thousand dollars' worth of shares in Russian oil companies (also in the hands of specially trained intelligence offi cers), and concealed the ownership of those shares by having them registered in the name of Shleifer's father-in-law. • All four of the named Harvard personnel and th eir wives (girlfriends) participated in the launching of Russia's first licensed mutual fund, which was started by a company named Pallada, founded and managed by Hay's then girlfriend (now wife) - and/or Russia's first licensed mutual fund depository, the First Russian Speci alised Depository (FRSD), starte d by Hebert's Russian business 'partner', Julia Zagachin."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"692 A DDENDUM 5: Corruption at Harvard • Hay and Hebert participated in the creation of a real estate advisory/property management firm to work with Hebert in establishing a real estate mutual fund, and to lease and manage properties for a project to which Hay wa s a key USAID adviser. • Jonathan Hay assisted Nancy Zimmerman in her at tempts to trade short-term Russian Government bonds (GKOs) and other Government debt, and to repatr iate the profits from such trades without paying the required Russian repatriation tax, and used USAI D funded staff and offices to set up and operate a Russian trading company to implement this scheme. The ease with which these Harvard officers were corrupted almost the moment they set foot in Russia, must have caused immense satisfaction and amusement in the bowels of the branch of the Soviet intelligence services tasked with corrupting Western officials and others who had rushed to the 'former' Soviet Union on the basis of their mistaken belief that the 'changes' which had taken place in 1989-91 were genuine. All in all, Harvard and its employ ees were alleged to have 'defraud ed the United States out of at least $40 million paid to Harvard' by USAID. The Complaint alleged that 'Shleifer and Hay abused their positions as high-level and trusted advisors to and on behalf of the United States in Russia, and misused resources funded by the United States for their own personal benefit and for the personal benefit of their wives, girlfriends and/or business associates'. The action was for the diversion of public money paid under a US Federal grant programme , and included claims for false claims, fraud, and breaches of fiduciary duty. The primary Harvard Representative, Shleifer, was the Principal Investigator and Project Director for USAID-funded agreements with Harvard for work on economic and legal reforms in Russia. Nancy Zimmerman, married to Shleifer, was opera ting an investment fund management company entitled 'Farallon Fixed Income Associates' in Cambridge, Massach usetts. Both individually and through this entity, Zimmerman was alleged to have been involved in a number of investments and financial transactions in Russia; and she allegedly used the USAID -funded staff and resources of the Harvard project, to assist her with these investments. The Complaint stated that 'after the Soviet Unio n dissolved in December 1991 [sic], the United States began providing limited assi stance to support reform. In Oct ober 1992, the Congress enacted the Freedom for Russia and the Emerging Eurasian Democracies [sic] and Open Market Support Act of 1992. This Act authorized a program, to be implemented primarily by USAID, to help the states of the former Soviet Union carry out political and economic reform in support of open markets, including \"establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision-making\"'. USAID sought to accomplish this task, in part, through the two cooperative agreements reached with Harvard University. The irony is that the USSR 'succumbed' to US Financial Warfare/bribery. ASSETS IN THE HANDS OF THE FEW The mentioned highly critical General Accounting Office report noted that 'Russia's transition path has been made harder by the concentration of power and income in the hands of a few, a process that had begun prior to the transition and that was accelerated by the privatization of the most valuable sectors of Russian enterprise in 1994 and 1995'. But neither the General Accounting Office nor any other Western investigating agency appears to have asked the most obvious related question: why were the as sets of the state 'privatised' into the hands of 'a few', and who were those 'few' - notwithstanding the abundance of evidence that all of the so-called 'oligarchs', without exception, are intelligence of ficers (note that we omit the usual mealy-mouthed adjective 'former'). One observer, however, appears to have had her suspicions. According to Janine Wedel, the author of 'Collision and Collusion: The Stra nge Case of Western Aid to Eastern Europe, 1989-98', the 'entire episode' of Harvard University's allege d corruption in Russia should prompt a critical examination of US policy towards Russia over the past decade: 'We need to look at how foreign policy in this very key area of Russian economic development was e ssentially privatized into the hands of a very small group of players on both sides with very little accountability'. Well, yes, no doubt the United States' policymakers need to review their entire misplaced pro- Moscow strategy, in all its confused and complex dimensions, as a matter of urgency. But first, they need, along with their counterparts in the West generally, to recognise the reality of the phenomenon we call criminalism. What is criminalism for? Its purposes are as follows: • To maximise the potential of criminal activity (e specially with regard to exploiting Gramscian opportunities for erodin g morality, penetration of institutions and blackmail arising from the avalanche of drug-derived proceeds) as an instrument for the advancement of the Revolution by undermining the capitalist system and its institu tions, especially the banks. • To destabilise capitalism generally through the enlargement of the underground economy and by popularising criminal activity, eroding standa rds, thus undermining governance generally."},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 693 • To discredit capitalism by equating it with organised crime, while disguising the revolutionary source of criminalism as a key instrument of Leninist (and German DVD) subversion strategy. These objectives conflict with familiar Western illusions. Actually, Professor Andrei Shleifer recently co -authored an article, would you believe, entitled 'Corruption', with a University of Chicago Professor, Robert W. Vishny, in 'The Quarterly Journal of Economics', which began with the following statement: 'We define government corruption as the sale by government officials of government property for personal gain. For example, gover nment officials often collect bribes for providing permits and licenses, for giving passage through customs, or for prohibiting the entry of competitors. In these cases, they charge personally for goods that the state o fficially owns.... Corruption is both pervasive and significant around the world'. And the authors cited past studies on corruption which 'examine ways of motivating the (economic) agent to be honest'. In response to the US Government's action against Shleifer in the present case, Earl Nemser, who repr esented Professor Shleifer and his wife, argued when the case was first publicised in September 2000 that the couple had no restrictions on their investment opportunities in Russia becaus e Shleifer was only a consultant to the project. CYNICAL DISREGARD OF SPECIFIC U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT TERMS But USAID's Cooperative Agreements, which Harvard had signed, had laid down that Harvard 'must develop the complete confidence and trust of the ho st government' (an absurd proposition, given the Leninist untrustworthiness of the host Government itself) and that 'a completely neutral third party, void of any vested interest in the contracting process, is required'. The Agreements provided that 'no employee of the grantee (Harvard) shall engage directly or indir ectly, either in the individual's own name or in the name or through an agency of another person, in any business, profession, or occupation in the foreign countries in which the individual is assigned, nor shall the individual make loans or investments to or in any business, profession or occupation in the foreign countries to which the individual is assigned'. 'The recipient shall maintain a code of standards of conduct that shall govern the performance of its officers, employees or agents in the awarding or administering of contr acts using USAID funds. Conflict of interest situations involving employees, officers or agents or their immediate families shall be avoided.... Harvard Institute for Internat ional Development employees and members of their families may engage in no financial transactions or investments within the Project Country.... Such transactions or investments include maintenanc e of savings accounts or the purchase of savings certificates, holding of debt instru ments, maintaining any interest whatsoever in any local business, or making investments of any kind in the Project Country'. In addition, illustrating how arro gant these high-level advisers who thought they had a sacred mission to establish free enterprise in 'post-Soviet' Russia had become, Shleifer was a member of Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Scienc es, which maintains a conflict of interest policy requiring the disclosure of potentia l conflicts of interest, including any relationship 'that might enable a member to influence Harvard's dealings w ith an outside organization in any way leading to personal gain or to improper advantage for anyone'. The University itself even included a Conflict of Interest Statement in its submission to USAID, stating that 'as a non-profit, academic institution, Harvard is committed to maintaining an objective and unbiased role'. Shleifer and his wife, the US Government allege d, basically ignored these restrictions. They bought stocks through Renova-Invest in many of th e Russian entities which were purportedly being privatised under detailed plans for which Shleifer was a key adviser, including Rostelcom, Gazprom, Irkaz, Sayansk, Bratsk, Vladimir Tractor and Chernogorneft - all of which were privatised into the hands of specially trained KGB and GRU officers masquerading as 'biznesmen'. In 1995, $60,000 was allegedly invested by Andrei Shleifer, while the Professor, financed by USAID, was involved in advising the Russian Government on debt policy and the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund concerning further extensions of cr edit to the Russian Government. Later, Renova- Invest employed Jonathan Hay and other USAID-funded staff to work on merger documents, including documents for an aluminiu m company, Irkaz, one of the entities in which Shleifer held stock purchased by Renova-Invest. The time spent by Hay and other USAID lawyers working on this 'private' KGB-controlled merger, which had nothing to do with USAID's project, was allegedly charged to USAID. In July 1994, Shleifer and Farallon Capital agreed to buy oil stocks in Russia, and Shleifer arranged for his investment in thes e stocks, which were almost all to be bought on the advice of one Igor Tsukanov, a KGB operative, to be held in the name of another - initially Zimmerman, but the shares were later registered in the name of Zimmerman's father. In a Memo dated"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"694 A DDENDUM 5: Corruption at Harvard 28th July 1994, cited in the official Complaint, initial investment was 'a nticipated to be $2.0 million, with an increase to $5.0 million if sufficien t investment opportunities are available. Andrei will invest 10% of his own capital, with shar es to be registered to Nancy Zimmerman'. Farallon Capital and Shleifer undertook three groups of purchases of oil stocks through an entity called CentreInvest in 1994. On 11th August 19 94, Shleifer wired $165,000 from his joint bank account with Nancy Zimmerman to a Channel Islands bank for the purchase of 30,000 shares in the Russian oil entity Purneftegaz, controlled by Soviet intelligence officers. On 31st August 1994, Mr Shleifer sent a ch eque for $99,000 from his own money market account to his father-in-law, who in turn wired $165,000 to a Channel Islands bank account for the purchase of 5,000 shares in the Russian oil entity Yugraneftegaz, stolen and controlled by Soviet intelligence officers [see pages 705 et seq.]. On 20th September 1994, Shleifer deposited a cheque for $66,000 made out by Jonathan Hay to Professor Sh leifer into his own individual bank account. On 4th November 1994, Shleifer wired $19,000 from this account to a Channel Islands account for the purchase of 1,000 shares of stock in the Russian oil entity Varieganneftegaz, controlled by Soviet intelligence officers. The Complaint asserted that within this total, about $10,000 of Jonathan Hay's funds were used. In late 1995 or early in 1996, the defendants and the USAID-financed Russian Harvard employee Julia Zagachin, put togeth er, promoted and/or financed a plan to launch the first Russian mutual fund management company (Pallada) and the First Russian Special ised Depository. These businesses were expected to be quite profitable, and both required licenses from the Russian Securities Commission, an entity that Harvard Univ ersity, Professor Shleifer and Jonathan Hay had helped to establish, and to which Shleifer and Hay were the advisers. Both Pallada and the Russian Specialised Depositor y received the first operating licenses of their kind ever issued by the Russian Securities Co mmission. Jonathan Hay then actively solicited investments in Pallada and the depository institu tion from Zimmerman, the Farallon companies and others. He also travelled to Boston for meetings with representative of at least one potential investor. In March 1996, Elizabeth Hebert se parately sent a business plan to an affiliate of the above potential investor, entitled Commonwealth Property Investors, for the establishment of a Russian domestic fund management company to launch one of the first mutual funds in Russia. The Business Plan (for what was to become Pallada and the First Russian Specialised Depository) sought investors to contribute $3.5 million, in exchange for 30% of the proposed companies' equity. The Plan predicted that the company or companies would generate $28 million annually in pretax profits in the first five years of operations. It stated that the management team would 'consist of a Chief Executive Officer, Elizabeth Hebert, and a Chief Operating Officer, Julia Zagach in'. The Complaint states that 'at the time Zagachin was being paid as a full-time employee of Harvard on the USAID-funded project under Hay's supervision, while in fact working on star ting this private mutual fund and/or depository business with Hebert'. Note throughout all this that the Harvard academics blithely assumed not only that a true free enterprise environment was being constructed in Russia, and that they were among the leading builders thereof, but that massive profits lay in st ore for lucky investors able to exploit the assets which belong ultimately to the Party-State. The lure of bonanza profits was so great, and the Harvard employees' estimation of their own brilliance so inflated, that they ignored the restrictions set out in their contracts - or else assumed, as US criminalist operatives are apt to do, that the US authorities would never notice, given pervasive se lf-reinforcing US and Soviet corruption, in a corrupt, 'free-for-all' environment. For Hebert and Zagachin planned to exploit thei r close relationship with the Russian Securities Commission, to which Jonathan Hay was a key advi ser, to gain a competitive advantage over other funds. The Business Plan stated that 'the timing is critical to ensure the Fund is able to benefit from expected barriers to entry the first of which is an untested licensing procedure for the fund management company. It is expected that the fact that the team is well known to and trusted by the regulators suggests that it will be able to facilitate the i ssuance of licenses and clear other regulatory hurdles which are expected to be a hindrance to competitors'. Manifestly, the Jewish Harvard academics/offici als saw their deployment to and involvement with the US-promoted 'post'-Soviet privatisati on offensive as a golden opportunity for self- enrichment, in blatant disregard for the terms of their contracts and for any ethical considerations. The dangers were anticipated in their contracts, which proved ineffective."},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 695 INSTITUTE FOR LA W-BASED ECONOMY Adding to the ironies surr ounding the Harvard team's behaviour, Hebert indicated in the Business Plan that she and Zagachin intended to use the services of the Institute for Law-Based Economy, a Russian affiliate of the Harvard project under the direction of Jonathan Hay and largely funded by USAID. The Plan stated that 'it will also be important to develop solutions in close cooperation with the Federal Commission which intends to carefully regulate these functions. To ensure full compliance, the Institute for Law-Based Economy (the Russian non-profit unit that drafted the Regulations) has already been retained to provide advice in the consideration of vari ous options and to facilitate the development of those options where regulatory assistance is required'. Working in an environment which they must have re cognised to be absolutely corrupt, but which they were being employed to clean up, these Harvard of ficers threw all caution to the winds, making a mockery of the grandiose pretensions of their University, and of USAID and the US Government itself. In a solicitation Memorandum, Jonathan Hay stated that 'we' are seeking an investment of $1.2 million in the FRSD. The regulations governing mutual funds 'were draf ted by the Russian legal team that I manage'. Hay boasted of the probable success of the investment as be ing attributable to its close relationship with the [corrupt] Russian Securities Commission, stating that 'we are likely to get a license before anyone else, which will give us a significant first mover advantage'. The Memorandum added that 'we are not interested in your investment in the Specialised Depository unless this is helpful to raise the funds needed to start the fund management company' (being created by Hay's girlfriend, Hebert) 'because, among other things, we frankly want to start both of these things at the same time and are tying our futures to this strategy'. In due course, Hay and his father invested the required minimum capitalisation of $400,000 to purchase the FRSD. 'At the same time', the Complaint noted, 'Hay co ntinued to supervise regulations relating to FRSD, and to direct technical assistance funded under sepa rate contracts by both US AID and the World Bank to the benefit of the FRSD'. Separately, in the spring of 1996, while employed on the USAID-funded Harvard project, Jonathan Hay collaborated with Elizabeth Hebert and with certain USAID and World Bank-funded employees under his direction to start a real estate development and prop erty management business, which was to collaborate with some of the other named entities to create a re al estate mutual fund and to develop and manage real properties in Russia. Under a 'Draft Terms of Agreem ent', Hay stated that the company, named Korona, 'would have the goal of purchasing, developing and managing real estate projects in Russia's regions'. A senior Harvard employee repeatedly objecte d to these abuses, writing to Shleifer: 'I can't imagine that you will do anything about this, but I believe that it is not right all round and does not show good faith on anyone's part'. She also wrote that Harvard would 'rue the day' when USAID found out. Which it belatedly did. ■ ADDENDUM SIX: International Currency Review 29,2: December 2003 COVERT SOVIET FINANCIAL SCAMS SOVIET FINANCIAL CRIMINALIST- INTELUGENCE-ILLUMINATI OPERATIONS T h e i n t e g r a t i o n o f organised criminal operations with Soviet and false 'post'-Soviet financial sector practice will help to explain how the Soviet structur es could seamlessly accommodate the US intelligence 'Financial Warfare' offensive - in pursuit of the fulfilment of the Soviet long-range Leninist deception strategy promulgated at the 22nd CPSU Congress held at the newly constructed, modernistic Moscow Palace of Congresses in October 1961, and ratif ied at the 81-Party Congress held in Moscow on 6th December that year 1 . The following study will show that the Soviet a nd post-Soviet financial sy stem is infested with criminal practice, one corollary of wh ich, of course, is that all Western financial institutions and businesses operating in the 'former' USSR need to understand that it is still the case that no 'legal' agreement has any underlying validity, since the concept of 'legality' is still, under covert as under overt Communism, what happens to enter into the heads of apparatchi ks or KGB-GRU supremos at any point in time. Contrary to popular belief, the 1998 Soviet debt defaul t was not the result of 'market reform' - the facile assumption made by the Western financial media. It was a corollary of the criminalised foreign trade system that had prevailed under overt Communism and which Western operatives exploited. This system had been used, certainly since the 1950s, to funnel foreign currency out of the country, for parking in Soviet banks abroad, and in accounts held at innumerable Western banks."},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"696 A DDENDUM 6: Covert Soviet Financial Scams In addition, as explained in 'Red Cocaine: The Drugging of America and the West', by Dr Joseph Douglass Jr. [see: www.edwardharle.org] the Soviets had carefu lly selected the West ern institutions and bankers whom they identified as being the most co rruptible, with whom to cooperate in ensuring the successful laundering and placement of the anticip ated vast financial accruals they would be generating from the launch of their intensive pe netration and consolidation of their own drug- trafficking operations, in the second half of the 1960s. This ope ration, planned on a global scale, was initially modelled upon the Chinese Communists' ear ly drug-trafficking and distributing operations, which Mao Tse-Tung's cadres had used first against the Chinese population and then, after 1949, had expanded regionally to corrupt regime s and populations in the Far East. Clearly, the Western institutions selected by the Soviets for drug money-laundering purposes were also used to park and handle foreign currency derived from other activities out of the USSR, for safekeeping. These banks have since been used to handle Western drug money flows, as well. In parallel with the sizeable flow-of-funds associ ated with Soviet-supervis ed and -controlled drug operations - Fidel Castro fell out with Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s over Cuba's cut, which he wanted raised to 30%, from a much lower level - the ongoing Soviet-era financial system was heavily skewed towards the illicit sale of domestic raw materials (oil, gas, and metals). It was accordingly 'no problem' for experienced, expe rt US 'Financial Warfare ' and other operatives to become involved in parallel transactions with experien ced Soviet intelligence counterparties using the specially created US Title 18 Section 6 intelligence corporations, mainly based offshore and equipped with offshore bank accounts all over the world. Unfortunatel y, corrupt US intelligence operatives nave joined with Soviet criminalists in global scamming and corrupt banking practices. The 'pure' criminalist Soviet method was to dum p domestically-produced commodities at below world market prices with 'friendly' foreign, likewise main ly offshore, companies. Some (probably all) of these 'foreign' corporations, like Plantronik Gm bH, 'were' (are) in fact controlled by Soviet operatives. Others were controlled by intelligence officers, either employed by the US Treasury's special 'Financial Warfare' cadres, or else working for other components of the vast US intelligence community. Clearly, when the US counterparty was (is) a 'priva tised' entity working under the US Presidential Executive Order 12333 regime, then the scope for embezzlemen t by the operators of such corporations, was/is prospectively open-ended. A number of US intelligence officers and fake 'lawyers' fell into temptation, but the most distinguished of their number, Leo E Wanta, the senior Presidential intelligence aide, was not among them: so he was deliberately 'taken down' so that the giga-funds could be exploited. THE OVERT SOVIET CORRUPTION MODEL In the 'pure' corrupted Soviet model, domesti cally produced raw materials go through a 'cut-out' chain of offshore intermediaries, with the superpro fits generated by such resale operations winding up in offshore bank accounts abroad. It is alleged by some analysts that under overt Communism, these superprofits were redeployed to serve the needs and expenses of the World Communist movement, and in the 'fight against world capitalism ', whereas today the superprofits are used for 'other purposes'. This was the 'view' publicised by the 'financial analyst', Andrei Sotnik, in Moscow News [13-19th August 2003]; however, since 'Moscow News' is an outle t for regime disinformation, one must be on the lookout for lies; and th is is one of them. Since there has never been any true discontinuity of classical Soviet Leninist strategy, the superprofits continue to be required for use by the World Revolution, as before - a fact of life demonstrated by the widely publicised events surrounding Mikhail Khodorkhovsky, the Soviet intelligence-crook and erstwhile Gorbachev-era Minister, into whose hands certain vast assets of the Soviet Party-state were temporarily 'privatised'. True to long-established routine, dating back to Stalin's time, the apparat demands its assets/funds back with compound intere st - at a time of its own choosing No doubt, as is the case with the 'privatised' US operational intelligence cadres and groups, vast amounts of funds have been, and cont inue to be, stolen and siphoned of f into private bank accounts which 'oligarchs' (in fact, Soviet intelligence operatives) may hope cannot be traced by the directors of the World Revolution in Moscow. However the Soviets possess and use cloned PROMIS and PROMIS-derived software, so that belief, if held, would not be soundly based. Fearful that the ongoing Soviet authorities are now indeed capable of tracing their foreign bank accounts, some 'oligarchs' - Messrs. Abramovich and Poltanin, for instance - have resorted to laundering their allegedly ill-gotten funds into the coffers of impecunious but world-famous British soccer clubs. The money disappears of course from the state bud get for good. The network of offshore 'foreign' but controlled companies established by the overt and covert Soviet Communists in and since the 1990s interrelates, mimics and interacts with the pa rallel Title 18 Section 6 USG corporations, and"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 697 with similar companies organised by other intelligence communities, and has been a primary focus of foreign exchange operations undertaken by the covert ruling Moscow establishment, and by the 'big business' sector that has em erged since the 'changes' of 1990-92. This s ector is controlled by the state, using a rather more sophisticated variant of Lenin's concep t of 'state capitalism' which we call 'state-controlled capitalism'. This 'new firm' of 'state-controlled ca pitalism' was formally inaugurated in 1990, when the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) adopted a resolution 'empowering' the Communist apparatchiks (officials) and of course in telligence officers to set up corporations abroad using assets that belonged to the Party-State. Please note that this re solution was adopted by the CPSU Central Committee, presided over by President Mikhail Gorbachev, and not by President Boris Yeltsin's parallel RSFSR structures. The resolution precisely matched the effect of President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of January 1981. CAPITAL FLIGHT FROM THE USSR Post-war capital flight from the USSR, however, bega n in the 1950s - although as has been noted, it was always endemic among the Communist Party elite, from the earliest days of the supremacy of this criminal organisation. However it was only apparen tly in the 1950s that Western intelligence services began reporting the opening of secret numbered accounts at Swiss banks and at banks in some other countries, by holders of Soviet passports. From the moment that Mikhail Gorbachev was appoint ed General Secretary of the CPSU, capital flight accelerated sharply. According to French intelligence sources alone, the CPSU controlled 84 external companies, held more than 7,000 bank accounts (as re ported in our associated intelligence service, Soviet Analyst, in the early 1990s), and maintained at leas t $25 billion in offshore deposits and in offshore-based investments. By today's stan dards, this is minuscule. Many years ago, in the early 1970s, this service hi nted, in an article on Soviet finances, that the Soviets could not necessarily ever be relied upon to meet their formal financial obligations. For this outrageous observation, we were resoundingly reprimanded by Moscow Narodny Bank, an institution that allegedly acted as a primary money-la undering outlet, and which is actually a British-registered institution, located in the City of London. We were belatedly proved right in 1990, when all the assets held in the client accounts of the Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Activity, known as Vneshekon-ombank (a.k.a. VEB), all of a sudden mysteriously disappeared. The clients of this Soviet institution (of course many were state en tities) were informed that they would not get their money back. Simultaneously, however, Gosbank (the Soviet central bank, under the former head of Moscow Narodny Bank, Viktor Gerashchen ko) exploited Vneshekonombank to funnel about $6.0 billion to the Russian banks abroad, ostensibly to enable those institutions to bail out the foreign clients who had lost all their money. As indicated, the funds provided were ostensibly, for foreign public consumption, intended to pay off foreign creditors; yet in practice, these funds were reclassified as resources made available to finance Gosban k shareholdings in, and capital for, Soviet bank affiliates abroad. In other words, the Soviet bank's creditors never received a single groat - all the money having of course disappeared through a network of offshore co mpanies. All Russian banks operating abroad, just like Vneshekonombank, have a diversified network of dependent fore ign structures, consisting of banks, financial and consulting companies, trading houses, production enterprises, and so forth: so the terms Vneshekonombank, or VEB or else 'Russian banks abroad ', are essentially intercha ngeable here, and can be taken as referring to the entire sub-network of affiliated structures. We will first pursue, in a little more detail, such information as is available about what happened next - before inserting a rather obvious suggestion of our own. It happened that Vneshekonombank received a number of foreign credits through the aforementioned So viet institutions abroad, without processing them through the country's national budgetary procedures. For instance, during 1990, the Persian Gulf countries actually provided the Soviet Union with a loan worth $1.75 billion. This loan was extended shortly ahead of the Operation Desert Storm. According in fact to Western media reports, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and also the United Arab Emirates made this sum available to Moscow by way of recompensing the Soviets ostensibly for not vetoing an anti-Saddam Hussein reso lution at the United Nations Security Council. By the way, such 'bribery' is common practice at the United Nations, often involving liberal remittances of US 'Black Operations' money, as well. These funds were remitted through the Paris-base d Soviet institution, Eurobank (full title: Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord) an d its many affiliates. The money was never reported or included among the revenues or credits recorded in either the Soviet or the Russian state budgets. A proportion of this credit was remitted through Eurobank to the Jersey-based offshore company, Financial Management Co. (or FIMA CO), which featured prominently in the lurid accounts of the"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"698 A DDENDUM 6: Covert Soviet Financial Scams Russian financial scandals of 1998-99, reported in earli er issues of 'International Currency Review'. Why only a proportion? Because, in addition to the Gulf funds remi tted to Fimaco, components of the Gulf countries' loan money were paid out by Eur obank to affiliated Soviet companies, including Eurogrefi (Paris), RTD France (Paris), and also Evrofinance (Moscow). In practical terms, what this meant was that a loan which subsequently became part of the Soviet (and then, for the time being, the Ru ssian) foreign debt, was remitted to foreign Soviet-controlled offshore corporations, and was then used for 'confidential' purposes (namely, stolen, diverted or otherwise compromised). Of course, the corporations con cerned were set up by the Soviet intelligence community, just like Section 18, Title 6 US Governme nt proprietary corporations. But what of the funds that disappeared suddenly from Vneshekonombank? All enquiries on this score should be addressed, it is suggested, to th e 'Financial Warfare' apparatus of the US Treasury and/or to its 'privatised' operatives and cadres. THE FAKE BANKRUPTCY TECHNIQUE False bankruptcy 'was' a method also favoured by th e overt Communists in past years, and it further remains a preferred scamming method exploited by their covert Communist successors nowadays, for encouraging stolen funds to 'vanish' (the same met hod as is used by the CIA, which specialises in the raping and folding of targeted banks and trading corporations, such as Enron). For instance, in April 1989, Banca del Gottardo (Lugano) arranged for an enterp rise calling itself Interplastika to receive a loan worth $100 million, underwritten by Vneshekonombank, on the ostensible basis that the loan recipient was in fact the Soviet foreign trade associat ion, Tekhnoimport. An ope rative called Behgjet P accoli transferred 25% of the bank loan proceeds, which had been made available in 1990, to Te khnoimport. Interplastika then promptly went bust, a nd all the rest of the money was 'lost'. Sounds familiar? In early 2000, Russia suddenly re cognised the Vneshekonombank's fina ncial obligations to Banca del Gottardo, incorporating the amount into its foreign state debt; and this book 'adjustment was implemented without pressure from any know n international financial investigation. What happened to the 75% of the funds made available in 1990? We don't know. But this is what happened next. In November 1994, the Banca del Gottardo granted a loan worth - wait for it - $100 million, to a South African corporation, employing precious metals and gems as collateral: five metric tons of gold coins issued in the years 1928-72 were made available to the South African company by the Russian Federation Committee for Pr ecious Metals and Precious Stones. The proceeds of the odd loan were used to pay amounts due to a company called Mabatex, the Chief Executive Officer of which at the time was Behgjet Paccoli, from various offshore-based subcontractors for the 'renovation work taking place on of parts of the Kremlin'. Then, the final 'surprise': the South African company itself disappeared without repaying the loan. Hence, the model of crminalism using offshore companies devised and applied for years by the CPSU Central Committee, continued to function perfectly. Moreover the method of making funds 'vanish' - causing the relevant company to go bankrupt - is a standard and fool-proof criminalist-intelligen ce modus operandi, THE STATE OBLIGATIONS DEBT FIASCO According to the 'objective'-sounding Russian Audit Ch amber, the Russian Finance Ministry's obligations towards the State Bank of the Russian Federation had risen by 156 times, compared with the amounts outstanding to the bank on 1st January 1993. One factor underlying this fantastic increase was that the issuance of state debt obligati ons - that is, those obligations known as GKO short-term state bonds - proliferated between 1993 and 1998. However the GKO financial pyramid or Ponzi Game would have been im possible to invent had it not been for the officially sanctioned offshore company-based financial criminalist rip-off model outlined above. Western clients bought GKOs only if the Russian authorities guaranteed them with matching deposits at their foreign banks. The Western clients were what Lenin woul d have called 'Useful Idiots' - always very useful to the Revolutioa and idiotically stupid in naively im agining that the precautionary arrangements of the foreign bank deposits could be relied upon, or that the Leninist deceivers they were dealing with could ever be trusted. When Russia duly defaulted on its external debts in 1998, the funds in the precautionary deposit accounts disappeared. In July 1993, the Russian Central Bank signed an agreement with FIMACO - the main shareholder in which was the Soviet-owned, Paris-based Eurobank, which was about 80% owned by the Russian Central Bank itself- concerning the transfer to FIMACO of financial assets for fidu ciary management purposes. The assets in question represented Russia's official foreign exchange reserves (a proportion of them), Interior Ministry credits, and Russian Finance Ministry Securities."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 699 Thanks to its exotic arrangements with the Jersey -based FIMACO (the operations of which were in practice conducted in Paris by Eurobank, albeit being booked through FIMACO), the Russian Central Bank found that it was able to secure substantial profits fr om the placement of state foreign exchange reserves on the foreign financial markets. FIMACO (managed by Eurobank) was now directed to convert those assets, first, into first class bank deposits within the European Union, and then into GKO-Federal loan bonds (OFZs). Thus in 1996, Eurobank, which had set up Fimaco, received from the Russian Central Bank a total of $855 million, which was employed to create back-up deposits at Eurobank, 'guaranteeing' the repayment of funds invested by Euroba nk in Russian GKOs. LAUNDERING TECHNIQUES IDENTICAL TO THOSE USED BY U.S. CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE According to the Russian Federation Prosecutor Ge neral's Office, amounts of $37.3 billion, DM9.98 billion, ¥379.9 billion, Ffr11.98 billion and £662.6 milli on of foreign exchange reserves that belonged to the Russian state were steadily 'transferred' over a five-year period. By the way, 'transfers' is a Soviet weasel word widely used in this underworld to denote scams, transactions, swaps, exchanges, deals and all categories of exotic financial and commodity transactions, without the need for specifics. FIMACO and Eurobank both held between them a majo rity holding in the AKB Evrofinance joint-stock commercial bank (Moscow), evidently one of the lead ing 'players' (i.e. institutional gamblers) on the domestic futures market, accounting for between 10% a nd 15% of the total volume of trades on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, a mechanism that was ideal for money-laundering on a grand scale. Accordingly, a perception in certain Moscow quarters, and in certain in ternational financial circles, that FIMACO was employed to pump money into the Russian Central Bank's own win-win GKO pyramid Ponzi scheme, plus cream-o ffs, is quite plausible. INTERACTION WITH U.S. SERIAL INTELLIGENCE CRIMINALISTS However, other scenarios can easily be imagined - including collaboration with ongoing US 'Financial Warfare' mopping-up operations. Sp ecial mention should also be made of the apparently co-related 'French connection' to the 1998 Moscow meltdown. The US hedge fund, High-Risk Opportunities Hub Fund, filed a lawsuit claiming $1.0 billion against the big French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, charging them with failing to honour thei r obligations in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts on the Russian foreign exchange market. One could consider this as providing indirect evidence of participation of French banks - in addition to the Paris-based Soviet Eurobank and Evrofinance - on the GKO market. Evidently, by May 1998, GKOs accounted for as much as 50% of the portfolio held by High-Risk Opportunities Hub Fund. Now consider these facts, concerning Soviet/Russian equivalents of US T itle 18, Section 6 intelligence corporations author ised by Reagan's Executive Order 12333. The following Russian criminalist-intelligence companies involved in the export of Russian raw materials (at below world market prices: see above) 'had ' (may still have) accounts at Swiss affiliates of the French banks, Indosuez 2 and Credit Agricole: • Balcar International Inc., and VAEKO Europe Ltd. (imp licated in oil transactions of Balcar Trading a company of considerable notoriety in Russia). • CROCO Company, of Panama, involved in the misappropriation of receipts from export operations of Kimineft, under the Komilux Finance project. • Norwood Properties Inc., involved in petroleum shipments to Russian space launch centres. • Andava and Forus (the Aeroflot affair). • Kazakhstan: Altay Inc., Orel Capital Ltd., Berkut Ho lding Ltd., and other companies linked to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, a Moscow (Leninist) stooge. The following very dubious Soviet/Russian intellige nce corporations involved in the exportation of Russian raw materials (at well below world market prices: see above) 'had ' (may still have) accounts at the Swiss affiliate of Paribas: • Vitol SA, Geneva, Chechen oil exports. • Danton Trading, Dublin, Ireland: Purchase of gr ain in Kazakhstan by way of barter payments towards Russian oil shipments. • Itera International Energy, Georgia. • Energo Handels AG, Zug (a special 'inner' tax ha ven), Switzerland: The diversion of receipts from the exportation of Russian gas outside Russia. • Firms controlled by the Israeli-Russian citizen, Arkady Gaidamak: The shipment of weaponry to Angola in exchange for oil, in fulf ilment of World Revolution strategic tasks. These details, of course, reflect ju st the tip of a colossal iceberg of ongoing covert Soviet offshore company operations using Western banks - just like th e activities of the American intelligence Title 18,"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"700 A DDENDUM 6: Covert Soviet Financial Scams Section 6 firms. In other words, elements of the deeply criminalised intelligence services of the covert Soviet Union and of the United States use the same ba sic criminalist methodology, and are 'in bed together'. As the 'takedown' of Leo Emil Wanta demonstrated, th ere is therefore no place for uncorrupt intelligence operatives in this milieu. No doubt it is routinely rationalised in US intelligence circles that Western intelligence has had no choice but to 'get down in the gutter' with the proficient and experienced Soviet offshore criminalists, on the pretext that this is the only way the West can keep 'up to speed' with what the Soviets are doing to disrupt the capitalist system. This would, indeed, be a comforting thought - if it provided the sole rationale for this corrosive activity. But it doesn't. At le ast since the promulgation of President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order 12333, certain of the most powerful US intelligence-linked cadres, groups and operatives have succumbed to the obvious temptation to help themselves to vast accruals of funds, just like their Soviet counterparts. Only the Americans concerned have been doing this on a far larger scale than the Soviets. That's one of the factors that is so alarming. According to se veral sources, the late veteran US presswoman Sarah McLendon was told by former President George Bush Sr., whom she interviewed in 1992: 'If the public were to find out what we have done, they would chase us down the streets and lynch us' 3 . Another version of this has George Bush Sr saying th at 'if the American people were to find out what we've done, they would string us all up from lamp posts' . That in turn gave rise to this Author's quip that we might all do worse than buy shares in street furniture manufacturers. ■ Notes: 1. The US and Western perception that 'we won the Cold War' is completely false. With the benefit of the findings of our recent research, it is clear that this arrogant attitude was adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom, especially, because these two financial power s (the largest in the world) believed that what they perceived to be their 'successful' 'Financial Wa rfare' operations against the Soviet Union, brought the Soviet Union and its empire to its knees. Documentar y evidence in reality shows that 'Financial Warfare' operations were being conducted against the USSR as early as 1988, and that they continued relentlessly to the end of 1991 - and that subsequently such US 'B lack Operations' have continued, as though there had indeed never been any actual discontinuity and as though the covert USSR remains 'the enemy', which is actually the case. It should be observed that the Un ited States and other predatory powers regard 'Financial Warfare' as just one element in a whole armoury of means of waging war: 'Financial Warfare' is officially considered unequivocally to be a standard method of c onducting warfare - indeed, in many ways a more efficient means than the methods normally representa tive of modern warfare techniques. Equipped with this mentality, the United States and other Western financi al powers (especially the United Kingdom) jumped to the conclusion that the successful 'takedowns' of the Soviet rouble, t he Soviet gold reserves, and of other crucial Soviet resources, were directly responsible for the 'collapse' of the USSR. While this was true, the Western financial powers were creatively double-crossed by the expert Leninist Soviet strategists, who nevertheless collaborated extensively (and continue to collaborate, as do their Chinese Communist counterparts), with Wester n 'Financial Warfare' intellig ence operatives, by accepti ng their bribes , undertaking transactions with them, and entering wi llingly and extensively into operations, in which they had for decades been past-masters, knowing every variant of under world scams invented by reprobate mankind. Being somewhat unversed in Leninist thin king, the Americans may have failed to realise that the Soviets were in fact just 'going along' with their (US) 'Financial Warfare' projects, as they assisted and accelerated the long-prepared and deliberate pursuit of Moscow 's 'collapsible Communism' strategy. It is virtually impossible to assist some American intelligence specialists to understand that they were duped, because they have been so convinced of their own intelligence superiority for so long, that they cannot bring themselves to recognise that they were outsmarted. In other words, they fell victim to the classic trap identified by the ancient Chinese strate gist, Sun-Tzu, explained in his treatise The Art of War': 'Make your enemy arrogant'. What is more, US intelligence fell in to this trap, notwithstanding the fact that, as in the Soviet Bloc's armed forces, and in the fake 'post'-Sovie t military, US intelligence operatives are required to study The Art of War'. Obviously, some of them failed to understood or applied what they were required to read. 2. Indosuez London was a correspondent bank working with Status-Credit Bank Moscow on transactions for a Status-Credit Bank's client which was a Title 18, Section 6 US Government intelligence corporation. 3. Another extraordinary admission - this time by President George W. Bush Jr. - appears in the President's autobiography, entitled 'A Charge to Keep' [William Mo rrow and Company, New York, 2000], page 47. It reads as follows: 'My senior year [at Yale University] I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society, so secret I can't say anything more, ft was a chance to make fourteen new friends'. • This admission reminds us, of course, t hat the President followed his father (year of 1968) as a member of this occult, acquisitive and disgusting, German-originating, Rose Croix-link ed network, membership of which is incompatible with the Christianity that President George W. Bush professes. We add this point here to illustrate the curious habit that the Bushes se em to have of suddenly admitting things that, in more sober moments, they would not acknowledge. This habit appears to represent some kind of psychological response to the strain of keeping dark secrets all one's life, which these llluminati, by their own choice - and because they lack the strength to extric ate themselves from the horrors of their existence - have to endure. ■ See www.sovietanalyst.com for information about Soviet Analyst, An Intelligence Commentary"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 701 ADDENDUM SEVEN: International Cu rrency Review 29,2: December 2003 U.S. CRIMINALISM EXPOSED U.S. 'PRIVATISED' INTELLIGENCE CRIMINALISM REVEALED IN COURT DOCUMENTS On 5th September 2002, the Colorado US District Judge entered a judgment for $58,394,603, with a post- judgment interest of 1.8% from the date of judgment, against a Defendant calling himself Paul K.

Paul K Bryan, Special Air Operations Group, Inc., et al. Note: The following analysis contains abso lutely shocking, fully documented intelligence. Via this case, which was adjudicated in the context of RICO (The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, 18. U.S.,C. Sec. 1961, et sea.), it em erged that Paul K. Bryan (alternatively known as Lyle Edward Goeringer) 'was' the Director of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency - one of the highest and most hands-on positions in the organisation. Attempts have been made to intimidate observers who have sought to draw attention to this case, with one 'whistle blower' recently receiving a direct death threat in the event that any further coverage of this material were to surface. However the outline details, in sanitised form, are available on the lawyer's website, and the text of the 'Second Amended Complaint' filed by the lawyer on behalf of Vizantia-Exclusive Ltd, has both been posted on the Internet and is available for inspection under case Number 00-71800 at a Court in another state - the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division. Th e lawyer's website report states: 'The seven-day Michigan Federal jury trial (which ended on 15th May 2002) resulted in the award of $8,100,000 to the Plaintiff. The verdict amount is 27 times the Plaintiff's $300,000, which was stolen by Bryan's racketeering enterprise'. The suit alleged that CIA ope ratives defrauded investors in worldwide racketeering schemes under a pretext of investment in secret, high-yielding trading programs'. Vizantia-Exclusive, Ltd. v. Kristar, Inc., Eyeland Traders, Ltd, et al. The lawyer's posted account of th e Michigan Court trial continued: 'Vizantia-Exclusive was a Russian import/export gold mine and real estate development company which claimed to be a growing company. It invested $300,000 in a scheme promoted by Defendants Christenson and Bryan who claimed to have access to a secret, high-yield medium-term note-trading program. Defendants were able to convince the Plai ntiff of their alleged high-level CIA positions by revealing to the Plaintiff its own background secrets, that only a few (Russian) Government officials would have known. [In other words, Vizantia-Exclusive was itself a Russian crim inalist-intelligence corporation, engaged, like its criminalist US counterparts, in sh ady deals worldwide]. The Defendant Bryan allegedly convinced other victims of his company, Special Air Operations Group, of their affiliation with the US Government. Bryan misappropriated $2,000,000 (which resulted in th e $58,394,604 judgment rendered by the Colorado Federal Court) from an Austrian inve stor, $3,124,000 from an Arizona company, financial instruments such as North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank Guarantees (valued at $4,645 billion), Bulgarian Bills of Exchange (about $108 billion) and so on Defend ant Bryan produced a copy of correspondence and a Contract for the Sale of 320 trillion Iranian Rials (about $106 billion) to him, stipulated that he received about $6,000,000 in cash and admitted that he paid no income taxes from 1980 to the present'. Vizantia-Exclusive [the Soviet-Russian criminalist-intelligence corporation] alleged violations of the RICO Act, fraud and conspiracy. It claimed that the company collapsed following the $300,000 loss because of its contracts and expected income from the Defendants' scheme; [and] it asked the jury for tens of millions of dollars because of the shocking and sensitive nature of the claims'. [Sic: In other words, the Soviet-Russian intellig ence-criminal company represented to the jury that it was 'shocked' by the claims (that its secrets were revealed to it by the De fendants), and the jury 'boughf this fairytale, no doubt appalled by the detailed information concerning CIA 'Financial Warfare' operations and provocations worldwide, revealed in the Courtroom]. The lawyer's website posting concluded as foll ows: 'Defendants admitted that they took the money. Bryan argued that the scheme was orches trated by Christenson and that the portion of"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"702 A DDENDUM 7: U.S. Criminalism Exposed Plaintiff's money that Bryan received, $200,000, was payment to him from Christenson for bringing investment programs to Christenson for his investors. Christenson claimed Bryan was to blame'. In other words the two main US CIA operatives just blamed each other. THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT The substantive information contained in this Court-filed document [Case Number 00-71800] filed for hearing before Judge Bernard A. Friedman in the Michigan Federal Court provides an eye-opening glimpse into the nature of the provocative, open-ended an d relentless 'Financial Warfare' operations conducted internationally by American and other intelligence communities. Informed observers say that this kind of activity is directed 'only against enemies' of the United States. It can only be 'justified', if at all, on the cynical basis of the familiar pretext - namely, that other countries' criminalised intelligence services are also behaving in an equally neinous and irresponsible manner agai nst sovereign governments and countries they consider to be enemies, including the United States. But even if such a pretext were to be capable of withstanding detailed scrutiny, the kind of nefarious behaviour described in the brief summaries that follo w, must invariably exacerbate underlying tensions between national governments, while negating continui ng diplomatic attempts to cement relations between the affected countries. In the present case, we have an extraordinary example of a US Court case throwing light upon dark activities involving US and ongoing covert Soviet intelligence. THE DEFENDANTS Vizanna-Exclusive Ltd, a Russian company with it s office in Moscow, sued the following parties: • Kristar Inc, Michigan; Eyeland Traders Ltd, foreign; Special Air Operations, Inc., Colorado; David B Christenson, individually and as Pres ident of Eyeland Traders Ltd [note the cynical Illuminati use of the word 'Eye' in this title, for the All-Seeing Eye of Set] and Krista r, Inc., and Financial Director of Special Air Operations Group, Inc.; Paul K Bryan, individual ly, and as President and CEO of Eyeland Traders, Ltd and Special Air Operations Group, Inc.; and Gordon Neil Freese, indi vidually and as CFO of Eyeland Traders, Ltd., and Special Air Operations Group, Inc. In the Complaint, Paul K Bryan was identified as Lyle Edward Goeringer, associated with Rapid Air Emergency Response, Inc [called REAR], a defunct Colorado Corporation, as well as with Special Air Operations Group (also a defunct Colorado Corporation), call ed SOAG; Eyeland Trader s, Ltd, an offshore company registered in Antigua, the West Indies [ETL] ; Bryan Bank International, an offshore bank, also registered in Antigua, an important British Overseas Te rritory; and a Texas sole proprietorship, Bryan Group International. He resided in Dallas, Texas [the home State of the Bush Family]. The Second Amended Complaint alleged that 'defendant ETL under the Dir ectorship of Bryan, became a Commitment Holder for 18 Governments, purchaser of gold for the US Treasury, and a manager of $160 to $211 billion of private funds, acco rding to Exhibit A filed with the Complaint, an Eyeland Traders summary dated 15th October 1997. Point 9 under the heading 'Parties' in the Complain t, reads as follows (the phrase 'who personally knows three US Presidents' being almost identical to a phrase used on behalf of Leo E. Wanta in papers made available to observers in the context of his own complain ts against the US Government): '9. Defendants Bryan, the CIA Director of Operat ions who personally knows three US Presidents, and his subordinate Christenson, worked for the CI A and the Presidential Committee (comprising past US Presidents and Government officials) at all times pertinent hereto'. This sentence contains some extremely important information, namely: (1). Confirmation of the existence of the Presidential Committee, whic h performs the same functions as the Leninist 'Security Council' or the 'Presiden'ts Council' - supragovernmental entities operating above the official structures of all Soviet-style Communist/Leninist Governments. (2). Confirmation of the ongoing character of such US intelligence operat ions, of which former Presidents will necessarily have detailed working knowledge. (3). Confirmation that intelligence (and therefore criminalist financial) operations occupy prominence, if not hegemony, over Government preoccupations at the Presidential level (an exact match with the pattern prevailing in Moscow). The Complaint also noted that Kristar, Inc, is a 'defunct Michigan corporation', once controlled by David B Christenson, of Dexter, Michigan; and that Fr eese (Gordon Neil) had been associated with First Berkeley Capital Corporation (a Te xas firm) and with Consolidated Tr ade and Commerce Ltd, registered in Panama City. It stated that 'Unknown US Govern ment officials [who were] associated with Bryan's enterprise promoted him, put him in charge of global financial operations, confirmed Mr Bryan's affiliation with the CIA in response to background inquiries [sic], blocked victims' complaints about Bryan's illegal actions, concealed his felony convictions and psychi atric records, shared"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 703 the profits with him, and otherwise conspired with Bryan's enterprise in executing its fraudulent racketeering schemes by providing it with logistical, technical, financial, legal, personal, official and geopolitical support'. Which is a 'tactful' way of c onfirming that the CIA was (is) engaged in global criminal operations [as confirmed in this Author's publications]. SUMMARY OF GLOBAL BLACK OPERATIONS The Michigan Federal Court Complaint contained the following allegations against Bryan, the CIA Director of Operations, et al, all of which were of course facilitated by the 'privatisation' provisions of Executive Order 12333 [see page 20 of the present work for details]: 1. Fiduciary and common fraud: Representing to Vizantia-Exclusive Ltd that they were in a position to generate colossal returns on funds, persuading them around 26th September 1 996 to sign a one-year 'Agreement for Asset Man- agement Program'. Accordingly, Vi zantia SWIFT wired $300,000 into ETL's account with European Union Bank*, St John's Antigua, which had been opened on 17th September 1996. Bryan received the money and 'spent it as he deemed fit'. The defendants then made oral and written representations to Vizantia- Exclusive Ltd, that its funds were leveraged and pr ofitably employed in Bryan's managed transactions involving: • The repatriation of 1928-1934 Series US F ederal Reserve Notes from Southeast Asia. • The sale of 320,000,000,000,000 Iranian Rials at the rate of 4,200 IRR per US$1.0 held in Bryan's account with Bangkok Bank, Thailand , pursuant to a 50/50 splitting agreement signed by Bryan with the Thai Royal Family. • R$50,000,000,000 held in Banco do Brazil, Sao Paolo exchanged for USD in Bank One, TX. • Redemption of 212 million 1982/88 Series Argentine pesos for $180,200,000. However the Soviet/Russian corporation 'could not verify the veracity of the Defendant's reports, because the Defendants stated that the Government-level transactions and high-yield programs were shrouded in secrecy, and no public records would be available to Plaintiff for confirmation thereof (an absolutely accurate statement). The Michigan Complaint added that the Plaintiff misr epresented that Vizantia would receive funds after one year as stated in the agreement, lied that banking statements would be provided, induced Vizantia to surrender funds for exclusive control and use by them, failed to set up a trust account for Vizantia, converted the Plaintiff's funds for their own pur poses, and deliberately defrauded them. In other words, the CIA ripped off a KGB entity. 2. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act accusations and death threats: • Victims of fraud scheme s concocted by the defendants were 'intimidated by death threats and invoking their CIA-based authority' - preventing enquiries 'as to actual transactions by shrouding them in secrecy, hurting the inquirers and forcing the victims to abandon their claim to commission or service compensation, or investment in the high-yielding trading programs'. Count 17 asserts as follows, confirming the 100% accuracy of our analysis that the CIA, exactly like the KGB, is a partly criminalised organisation using 'privatised' companies to conduct financ ial scams and provocati ons on a global scale: • The enterprise ringleader. Defendant Bryan, the Director of Operations of the CIA reporting to the CIA Director, set up a series of teams seeki ng investment [sic] opportunities worldwide and working on a commission basis or pursuant to their CIA assignments'. This is the most important piece of information that the Author has been able to extract from US Court records, indicating that the Central Intelligence Agency wages Financial Warfare against targets all over the world, probably continuously. • The scamming of North Korea: Messrs Brya n and Christenson boasted of and promised extremely high-yield returns on investments in their se cret US Government progr ams to Dr Helmut Otto Schramm, CEO of the humanitarian organization 'UNIMO GmbH, of Dres den, (east) Germany, who acted as an intermediary for the North Korean Government's humanitarian programs backed by the (North Korean Government's) Bank Guarantees'. Here, Schramm, an East German intelligence (ongoing STASI?) officer [i.e., DVD] posing as a do-gooder, who somehow had contacts with opposite numbers in North Korea, acted as the CIA's cutout. The Count con tinues: 'Pursuant to... Agreements signed by Bryan, Schramm and North Korean Government officials turned over on January 24, 1996, the eight (8) original Bank Guarantees issued and honored by the Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the DPRK) to Volkskas Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa, which gave a Safekeeping Receipt to Christenson (SOAG)'. The eight Bank Guarantees, having a market value of $4,645,000,000 and the Safekeeping Receipt 'came under the exclusive control of Bryan for obtaining cash credit lines by pledging the Bank Guarantees as a collateral, using the funds in trading programs and otherwise profiting from these"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"704 A DDENDUM 7: U.S. Criminalism Exposed financial assets'. Interestingly, Christenson then fell out with Mr Bryan - as happens in this 'Thieves' World', which probably explains why this case was al lowed to proceed, or 'slipped through the net'. Normally what happens is that the US Presidential Committee intervenes, exerts pressure on the judge concerned, and procures that the case is buried, with su itable payoffs as required. Alternatively, this 'falling out' was a feint, to induce paralysis in case of litigation. At all events, the Court document states that 'Christenson advised Schramm by fax that Bryan under false pretenses stole the Safekeeping Receipt and repeated the story given to Plaintiff that Christenson cannot help the victim because Bryan is responsible for the asset theft'. • The scamming of Bulgaria: Messrs Bryan and Chri stenson 'made false promises of high-yield returns on investments in secret Government trading programs to the Bulgarian Government'. In response, the ELMAZ 24 Consortium, the hinder of an asset ma nagement scheme supposedly benefiting the Bulgarian Government, transferred by mail Bills of Exchange having a face value of $100 million to Christenson for deposit in an account for Bryan's fi rm SOAG with Colorado National Bank . 'Bryan received these financial instruments issued by the Slavyeny Bank, Sofia, Bulgaria, plus at least $30,000 extracted from the Bulgarians under false promises.... Bryan converte d and never returned these Bills of Exchange and money to the Bulgarian company in spite of their requests'. The Bulgarian entity was of course likewise an intelligence-linked enterprise. Therefore, Bulgaria, s upposedly 'no longer an enemy' under the terms of the Joint Declaration of 22 States signed with pomp and circumstance by the NATO and Warsaw Pact powers on 19th November 1990, was relieved of $100 million by US criminalist-inte lligence operatives under the direction of the CIA Director of Operations [the American-german named Goeringer] - evidently six years after that accord was signed. • The scamming of a French part y: Bryan-SOAG 'asserting to be Commitmen t Holder, Buyer and Seller of precious metals, financial instruments and corporate debentures, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Jean-Louis Vidalo, of France, who re lying on Bryan's false promises, gave Bryan his Power of Attorney to employ three Certificates of Deposit for $30 million as a collateral to obtain cash credit lines and subsequent investment in trading programs. Vidalo wire-transferred these CDs issued by the Novacredi Bank, Brazil, for Makarska s.a., a Uru guayan mining company, which deposited $30 million in that bank for a four-year period and signed its rights to the CDs to Vidalo. Bryan converted these financial instruments obtained under false pr omises through his associates and used the CDs for obtaining cash credit lines or otherwise for his own and his US Government co-conspirators' benefit. [But] Bryan never returned the CDs and paid nothing to the CD owner'. • The scamming of Iran: Using intermediaries in Th ailand, 'Bryan and Christenson with their US Government co-conspirators diverted three Iraqi sh ips from their course and stole 320 trillion Iranian Rials ($106 billion). 'The Iranian Rials initially stored at the US Navy base in Thailand were deposited into Bryan's SAOG account at Bangkok Bank, Thailand. The Defendant Bryan became the legal owner or the IRR currency, entered into a 50/50 profit-shar ing contract with the Thailand Royal Family and similar contracts with the Government of Free Vietna m and China, and sold the IRR as his own' [1996]. The Iranian cash notes were embezzled/misappropriated. • Prince Hadji of North Borneo: In March 1997, 'Bryan requested Prince Hadji of North Borneo to give his 16 Argentine Peso cash notes to Bryan under a false promise of 'sample evalua tion' and payment within four days or the return of the notes, if the excha nge was not consummated'. The face value of the 1982-88 series Argentine Notes was 12 million Argentine peso s. Despite the Prince's numerous requests for the Notes' return, they were misappropriated. According to Bryan's ex-wife Ramona Lee Bryan, who, the document asserted, suffered 'a Bryan- attempted murder in 1980', 'Bryan told Ramona that his boss is George Tenet, the CIA Director'. The fact that Bryan/Goeringer was specifically identified in this Court document as the CIA's Director of Operations - arguably the most powerful and critical of all CIA posts, since this official directs the Agency's world-wide operations - and that he conducted tran sactions through the European Union Ba nk* [sic] based in the British Overseas Territory of Antigua is, finally, of exceptional importance and interest. US House of Representatives Banking and Financial Services Committee report desc ribed this bank, established in Antigua by Mikhail Khodorkovsky [KGB] as a 'KGB money-laundering operati on with stolen funds that were passed through Khodorkovsky of Menatep Bank as a KGB-controlled front firm'. Khodorkovsky, a KGB operative and a minor Government Minister under President Gorbach ev was, according to 'Pravda' [18th November 2003] acting all along on KGB instructions. In fact Menatep Bank, which he directed from 1992 to 1998, was the primary channel for the laundering of moni es derived from multiple intelligence scams out of Russia, frequently via Citibank in New York, and which provided 'financial services' to KGB-controlled mafiya 'families' and to Bu lgarian and Hungarian intelligence. Khodorkovsky was selected by GRU-President Putin to act as the 'example' he needed, to persuade the other KGB-GRU 'oligarchs' to disgorge stolen state assets."},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 705 ADDENDUM EIGHT: International Currency Review 29,3/4: March 2004 SOVIET CRIMINALISM: THE NOREX CASE From the text of the incredible US Court case th at follows in conclusion, the intricacies of a KGB- directed operation to seize Russian oil assets and to cream off vast profits into offshore accounts, are exposed. It focuses inter alia upon Simon (Semen) K ukes - an Academician of the Soviet Academy of (Leninist) Sciences, the reputed author of a sizeab le number of technical papers on energy issues, who emigrated to the United States at the time of the 'changes', became a prominent US oil man having married an American, and soon, of course, acquired US citizenship - subsequently resurfacing in Russia as a key oil magnate, taking over responsibility for running YUKOS from the imprisone d KGB operative Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In press interviews, Mr Kuke s naturally played down his role in the massive nexus of fraud described in this Complaint. This case provides detailed intelligence on the Soviet dimension of the criminalist intelligence underworld and how it has been interacting with corrupt Western offshore-based Illuminati intelligence structures. It provides a case study on the modus operandi of New Underworld Order cadres. Here we have a blow-by-blow account of the way oil assets are or have been acquired by controlled operatives in the 'former' Soviet Union. The veil is drawn away from ongoing Soviet criminalist methodology - complete with private armies of thug s who perform 'enforcement' services for their crim- inalised intelligence 'barons'. And we find that about the only difference between the 'former' USSR and the United States in this context, is th at the US intelligence cadres are encumb ered by the 'rule of law', which is of course non-existent in the 'former' USSR. But this case leads us even deeper into the chaos of the New Underworld Order. For a close reading of this Complaint will reveal that it is not just Semen Kukes, of dubious repute, who suddenly 'became' an American citizen. Other named Russians, re sident in the United States, are known KGB operatives who have been performing 'oligarch' services for the covert continuing Soviet strategy collective. So what, exactly, is going on here? It appears that the determined, rele ntless Western offensive to capture foreign oil resources - whether directly, as in Iraq, or indirectly - has been penetrated. Here we nave arguably the most sophisticated pre-emptive operation that an y intelligence community could have devised. Anticipating the global 'grabitisation' free-for-all wh ich is pulling the whole world towards the jungle, the Soviets took steps ahead of the game to positio n selected KGB/GRU operatives on the ground in the West, from where they have appeared to collaborate closely with Western oil interests in plans to develop Soviet petroleum and gas resources. But what the Moscow strategists had in mind diverged from the intentions of Western oil interests and their compliant intelligence services (mainly British an d American oil interests, which are rampaging around the world in pursuit of 'grabitisation' opportunities and in close cooperation). By inserting their own controlled operatives into the Western energy structures engaged in acquiring practical, management or actual control over Soviet energy assets, the KGB/GRU have ensured that they remain 100% in the driving seat - while the West imagines that, on the contrary, it is in full control.

The instant case concerns injuries to the business and property of Norex as a result of a massive racketeering and money-laundering scheme beginni ng in the 1990's operated and directed by American citizens, residents and companies, including Access Industr ies, Inc., Renova, Inc., Leonard Blavatnik, and Victor Vekselberg in conspiracy with American citizens Simon Kukes, Joseph Bakaleynik, and Elliot Spitz of the \"Alfa Group Consortium\" (the \"Illegal Scheme\") to take over a substantial portion of the Russian oil industry through their control and use of the Tyumen Oil Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (\"TNK\") based on an overall criminal structure which is set forth In Exhibit A. [Figure 99, page 711]. 2. The Illegal Scheme included the illegal takeover (the \"The Illegal Takeover\") of Yugraneft, another Russian oil company of which Norex was majority shareholder, which was effected by TNK in the \"old fashioned way\" - through fraudulent representation, sheer physical force of armed thugs, and corruption of the local government, legal system and law enforcement, which refused to intervene and protect Norex's rights. 3. Immediately following the Illegal Takeover of Y ugraneft, TNK seized its assets, including over $40 million which were held as dollar and rouble cash deposits and savings certificates and in excess of $500 million worth of oil production fa cilities, reserves, and receivables due from companies controlled by TNK. 4. The Illegal Scheme has been masterminded, operat ed and directed by Ac cess Renova, Blavatnik, Vekselberg, Kukes, and Bakaleynik, through offices in New York City, and Spitz, through offices in London and New York, and via mail and wire co mmunications originating from and sent to the United States, and travel between foreign jurisdictions and the United States. 5. In furtherance of the Illegal Scheme, Blavatni k, Vekselberg, Kukes, Bakaleynik, and Spitz, through their allies and companies which they control, directly or indirectly, in conspiracy with Alfa Group, committed or attempted to commit numerous criminal acts, including, but not limited to, bribery, extortion, mail and wire fraud, money-laundering, illegal transactions in monetary instruments, violation of the Travel Act, and tax fraud in furtherance of the Illegal Scheme. 6. The Illegal Scheme included, upon information a nd belief, bribes paid to Russian Government officials in order to enable Access/Renova and Alfa to take and maintain control of TNK during its privatization in 1997 and 1999, and bribes in order to enable TNK to take and maintain control of Yugraneft. 7. The Illegal Scheme included corr uption related to the insolvency and eventual bankruptcy and reorganization of Nizhnevartovsk Nefte Gaz (\"NNG\"), corruption of Russian bankruptcy proceedings of Kondpetroleum and Chemogorneft, wh ich were subsidiaries of the Russian oil company, Sidanco, and legal proceedings related to Yugraneft. 8. During these corrupted bankruptcies, certain Defe ndants arranged for the sale of oil to TNK and export of oil to Alfa-owned \"Crown Group\" at well below market prices and then effected rigged auctions of the assets of the bankrupt companies in order to obtain their petroleum reserves, to the detriment of Sidanco and its shareholders, in cluding BP-Amoco and the Harvard University Endowment Fund; as well as Norex, a creditor of both Chernogorneft a nd Nizhnevartovsk Nefte Gaz. 9. These proceedings were so brazenly corrupted that Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State during the Administration of President Clinton, instru cted the United States Export-Import Bank in 2000 not to guarantee loans for the sale of American manufactured equipment to TNK - a restriction only rescinded when TNK agreed to return some of the illegally stripped assets to the beneficial ownership of Sidanco. 10. In addition, in 2001, as reported by The Financial Times, the European Bank for Recon- struction and Development, placed the Alfa Group-owned Alfa Bank* on its \"black list\" on the basis of its business practices, making it no longer eligible for loans. [*This KGB bank is now the height of respectability. Its 'head of Strategy' in Moscow is a Mr Chris Weafer]. 11. The Illegal Scheme included the agreed-up on diversion of profits from TNK to some Defendants, in part through the issuance of invo ices for fabricated services by secretly"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 707 related offshore shell companies, in order to fra udulently avoid sharing such profits with TNK's other shareholders, including the Russian Government and American interests, and in violation of Russian and English tax law. 12. The various offshore shell companies which were secretly controlled by some Defendants, and operated in part by Astons Corporate Management , and received such funds, include LT Enterprise Limited, Sandwell Enterprises Limited, and Eastmount Properties Limited. 13. Tens of millions of dollars were wired through banks in the United States from the Crown Group to these offshore shell companies to pay invoices for fabricated services in order to create a slush fund, as evidenced by the invoices from Is le of Man based Sandwell and Bahamas based LT Enterprises attached as Exhibit B [not shown here]. 14. These funds were then either ki cked back to certain Defendant s or, upon information and belief, used to bribe Russian Government officials. 15. The Illegal Scheme included a massive tax fraud by which monies laundered through the slush funds were paid to the offshore accounts, i.e. \"o/s\" of American and UK citizens, who concealed such payments from taxation in violation of American and English tax law, as evidenced by the email attached hereto as Exhibit C. [Revealing document was appended]. 16. In addition, some Defendants arranged a sc heme by which the Crown Group submitted false invoices to TNK in order to furthe r divert its profits to the Crown Group and then to offshore slush fund companies, as evidenced by the email attached hereto. 17. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in his 2001 annual address that \"We practically are standing before a dangerous boundary, when a judge or other law enforcer can at will choose a rule, which seems to him the most appropriate. As a result, along with the 'shadow economy' we already have a kind of 'a shadow justice' taking shape\". 18. President Putin also noted in 2001 that while corr uption is the \"misfortune of many countries... in Russia, this has reached such a magnitude that the government has no right to ignore it\". [In other words, the monster created by the KGB itself, is out of control, as is the CIA in the United States]. 19. As a result of the Illegal Scheme and Illegal Takeover, Norex has lost its interest in Yugraneft, which has an estimated value in excess of $500 million. 20. As compensation for its loss, Norex seeks compensatory and treble damages in excess of $1.5 billion for violation of RICO, 18 U.S.C. §1961 et seq., costs, and attorneys' fees. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 21. Jurisdiction lies in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331 and 1337(a), 18 U.S.C. §1964(c) because this case arises under the laws of th e United States, based on claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C §1961 et sec.. 22. Venue is proper in this District under 18 U.S.C. §1965 and 28 U.S.C §1391 because events and transactions have taken place in this District. STATEMENT OF PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITIES 23. At relevant times from 1997 to da te, Defendants conspired with one another to defraud Norex and others and to obtain the property of Norex and others through illegal conduct including extortion, bribery and threatened acts of violence. 24. The complex scheme to defraud and racketeering activities through which the Defendants succeeded in taking illegally the property of Norex a nd others, consisted of an intricate pattern of individual transactions and group transactions. 25. In carrying out the scheme to defraud Norex and other victims, Defendant s engaged, inter alia, in conduct in violation of criminal statutes including mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1341 and §1343; interference with commerce by threats and violence, 18 U.S.C. §1951; in terstate and foreign travel in aid of racketeering enterprises, 18 U.S.C §1952; laundering of monetary instruments, 18 U.S.C §1956; and money-laundering, 18 U.S.C. §1957. 26.

BACKGROUND 108. Unlike countries with long developed free-market systems, the economic system that emerged in Russia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992 [sic! - Ed.) was largely unchecked by government laws or agency regulations. 109. As a result of privatization of the petroleum, banking, and other industries, there emerged a group of wealthy and politically in fluential individuals commonly known in Russia as \"oligarchs\". [These people are ALL KGB/GRU officers - Ed.]. 110. These oligarchs often have dire ct connections with Russian or ganized criminal enterprises which they use to extort other businessmen and exert their influence over the Russian legal and bureaucratic mechanisms, which pr ovide special favours to them. 111. In the absence of effective government regulation and law enforcement these oligarchs use their wealth to influence local regional and national officials, in cluding judges, to issue decisions favorable to businesses operated or controlled by the oligarchs. 112. According to the Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs acting in cooperation with the Strengthening Democratic Institutions Project (SDI), \"Russia's oligarchic"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 713 groups exert considerable control over the country's economic policies, politics in general and the media: politics can be said to have been somewhat privatized during the nation's economic privatization\". 113. On September 21,1999, Arnaud De Borchgrave, Director of the Global Organized Crime Project Center for Strategic and International Studies, gave sworn testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Financial Aid Services on the status of economic crime within the Russian Federation. 114. De Borchgrave testified that according to rese arch conducted by the Russian Organized Crime Taskforce, as published in the Russian Organized Crime Report, Russia's Court system is ineffective, does not consistently enforce established contract and commercial rights, has limited enforcement powers, and has become a de facto adjudicator for companies operated by economic criminals. 115. The report further points out that corr uption pervades every level of Russia's bureaucracy and has infiltrated the Russian banking system and financial markets. 116. The report cautioned that \"the lack of a formal legal infrastructure which is applied uniformly and publicly to all citizens, foreigners and compan ies operating in Russia, allows criminal groups to escape due process of the law and legitimate business and citizens to be victimized\". [This is what is intended globally, come The New Underworld Order]. 117. According to testimony before the Congress of the United States of America, the Russian Gov- ernment's anti-corruption program has been unsuccessful due to a lack of resources and the fact that salaries of government officials are so near the povert y level, that it is virtually impossible to eliminate corruption at the local levels. THE ILLEGAL SCHEME 118. As described below, Defendants engaged in an illegal scheme and artif ice (the \"Illegal Scheme\") which is open-ended and which was intended to defraud Norex and other persons. 119. Defendants have conspired together and acted in concert to commit numerous acts of fraud, violence, and other illegal activity in furtherance of the Illegal Scheme. 120. The Illegal Scheme has been used to defraud multiple victims and poses a substantial societal harm, in particular by defrauding persons in the United States. THE CORRUPT 1997 TNK PRIVATIZATION 121. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992 [sic ], the Russian Federation began to privatize the Russian oil industry. 122. In the industry, vertically integrated holding companies were established, each of which included a number of subsidiaries - oil production units, refineries, and marketing units. 123. In 1997, TNK was partially privatized, with a 40 % controlling stake purchased by Access/Ren-ova and the Alfa Group [i.e., by the KGB/GRU - Ed.], through joint venture investment vehicle known as ZAO Novy Holding. 124. The 1997 privatization of TNK was corrupt and scandalous, even by Russian standards. [Note: This is not the Author' statement: it is integral with the text of the Complaint], 125. Rather than providing for the sale of 40% of TNK's shares in a fair auction, the State Property Committee, headed by Alfred Koch (\" Koch\"), required any bidder to also own a certain refining unit, a controlling share of a company developing submersible oil pumps, and certain patents. 126. Not surprisingly, the companies which owned the refining unit, the contro lling share of the sub- mersible oil pump company, and certain patents were controlled by Access/Renova and Alfa Group. 127. A successful bidder was then required to purchase these three assets at a price in excess of $90 million, which was far in excess of their worth, and, further assume the risk that Access/Renova and Alfa, might resist such a sale. 128. In essence, this rigged structure guaranteed that Access/Renova and Alfa would be the winner of the auction at the minimum bid - which included a requir ement to invest certain funds in TNK -which was set hundreds of millions of dollars below the true value of such an interest in TNK. ROUTINE USE OF CRIMINAL BEHAVI OUR AT INTERGOVERNMENTAL LEVEL Detailed information about criminalist intelligence operations appears quite frequently in Court documents. This is one of the primary ironies of the life led by 'Dark Actors Playing Games'. On the one hand, they operate in a hidden jungle where the Rule of Law does not apply. On the other hand, when they have been double-crossed, scammed or otherwise defrauded, they rely with ruthless determination upon the judicial system and the Rule of Law in defence of their interests. This is of course a manifestation of the double-mind-edness of llluminati cadres, referred to extensively in the main text. In the context revealed by this Complaint, an additional layer of irony arises from the reality that 'socialist legality' in both the Sovi et and fake 'post'-Soviet contexts equates to whatever dominant apparatchiks may arbitrarily decide can be applicable. ■"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"714 A DDENDUM 8: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case 129. For example, a special investigation by the General Accounting Chamber of Russia determined that the 1997 privati zation violated numerous aspects of Russian law and plainly was concluded to favour the successful bidder. 130. Among the sixteen counts of violations of Russian laws and regulations listed by the General Accounting Chamber, was that the State Property Committee responsible for privatization failed to verify the legality of the source of funds used by Novy Holding to purchase its interest in TNK 131. Access/Renova and Alfa remitted bribes by means of the wiring of funds through banks in the United States to Koch and other Russian Government officials in order to obtain their support for the corrupt privatization of TNK in 1997. 132. Such allegation is based on common knowledge that Russian government officials were routinely bribed during privatizati on of state industries. 133. Such allegation is based on the lack of any other credible explanation for the requirement that the three assets be owned by the successful bidder and, further by the failure of the State Property Committee to compel the fulfilment of all investment conditions - even in violation of an edict by then President Boris Yeltsin that prohibited the transfer of title to the shares in TNK until all investment conditions were fulfilled. THE CORRUPT 1999 TNK PRIVATIZATION 134. Ultimately, in 1999, TNK was fully privatized, with the remaining portion of its shares sold to Access/Renova and the Alfa Group, this time through ZAO Noviye Prioritety. 135. The 1999 final privatization of TNK was equally corrupt. 136. Once again, the terms of the privatization were set by the State Property Committee in a fashion unduly favorable to Access/Renova and Alfa. 137. The minimum price set for the 1999 auction was so low (and so obviously corrupted) that the Russian Duma even passed a resolution urging the cancellation of the sale. 138. Nonetheless, despite the Duma's resolution, the 1999 auction resulted in Access/Renova and Alfa acquiring the remaining shares. RUSSIAN BANKRUPTCIES 139. Unfortunately, because of corruption in the Russian judiciary, which is \"influenced\" by powerful Russian business [KGB] interests, such as Access/Renova, Alfa, and TNK, the Russian bankruptcy process is used as an aggressive weapon by corporate predators to acquire victim companies or their assets. 140. The typical blueprint for \"bankruptcy theft\" in Russia by a corporate predator is managed in the following manner*: (a). Arrange for the filing of a petition, placing th e corporate victim into involuntary bankruptcy, often through connections with the local Federal or Regional Government, even if the victim is solvent and able to pay its debts; (b). Arrange for the appointment of a \"friendl y\" external manager (similar to a trustee under American bankruptcy law) of the victim through the corrupt Russian Court system and, thus, take control of the victim from its management and shareholders; (c). Direct the external manager to cancel contr acts for the sale of the victim's product with the existing trading partners and replace them with c ontracts with the predator's affiliated companies, often at prices well below market, thus diverting profits from the victim to the predator; (d). Obtain control of the creditors' committee, which decides vari ous issues during the bankruptcy either by forcing other claimants to sell their claims to the predator, ar ranging for the external manager to create sham claims in favour of the predator, or arrangement for the preferential payment of creditors unfriendly to the predator (and thus elim inating them from voting); (e). Once the profits are stripped fr om the victim, have the external manager declare that it cannot exist as a continuing entity and then liquidate its assets through a rigged judicial auction by which the predator acquires the assets for a pittance of their real worth. 141. As stated by the Head of the Russian Federal Service for Financial Recovery, Tatiana Tre- filova, bankruptcy \"is a weapon used against economic and political rivals\". 142. According to the Russian Duma Speaker, Genn adiy Seleznev, \"bankruptcy has become an instrument for redistribution of property\" [back into the hands of KGB-GRU ops]. 143. Access/Renova and Alfa followed the above blue print to the letter in regard to NNG, Kond- petroleum, and Chernogorneft. *Note: The abuse of bankruptcy arrangements by predatory intelligence entities with access to limitless corrupt sources of funds is not unknown in other contexts and parts of the world. However the practice of forcing targeted victims into bankruptcy when they are solvent is a particular speciality of Soviet criminalists."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 715 Figure 100: The cover sheet of the Complaint lodged by Norex Petroleum in the US Southern District Court of New York on 25th February 2002.

Nizhnevartovsk Nefte Gaz (\"NNG\") is an oil company located in th e Khanty-Man-siysky Autonomous District of Russia, which is part of the Tyumen Oblast (Region). 145. In 1997, after acquiring 40% of TNK, Acce ss/Renova and Alfa Group arranged through corrupted governmental officials to di vert flow of oil from NNG to TNK. 146. As a result, TNK was able to take over NNG and force it into bankrupt cy proceedings which resulted in the stripping of assets of NNG and their transfer to other TNK controlled companies. 147. Norex's interests were thus directly and adve rsely affected by th e corrupt NNG Bankruptcy and Reorganization and stripping of assets, because, Yugraneft, in which Norex was the majority shareholder, did not receive the oil ow ed to it by NNG. THE CORRUPT KONDPETROLEUM BANKRUPTCY 148. Kondpetroleum, a subsidiary of Sidanco at al l relevant times, is located in the Khanty- Mansiysky Autonomous District of Russia, which is part of the Tyumen Oblast. 149. During tne time of the bankruptcy, the governor of the Tyumen Oblast was Leonid Roketsky, who also was the chairman of TNK's Board of Directors. 150. In September 1998, the Kondpetrol eum bankruptcy was initiated. 151. During the bankruptcy, TNK arranged for the appointment of its handpicked candidate, Boris Nuriev (\"Nuriev\") as Kondpetroleum's external manager. 152. Nuriev immediately cancelled most of the o il sale contracts with Sidanco, and, not surprisingly, replaced them with contracts with T NK controlled entities eventually diverting the oil flows to Crown Group. 153. These sales of oil were at drastically reduced prices, resulting in the diversion of millions of dollars of profit to Crown Group. 154. As a result of these diverted profits, the external manager \"found\" that Kondpetroleum was insolvent and proposed sale of assets, which was approved by the corrupt Court on December 7, 1998. 155. Bidders other than TNK were wrongfully obstructed from bidding in the auction. 156. As a result, on October 21, 1999, the assets of Kondpetroleum were auctioned to a TNK affiliate created for the purposes of this bankruptc y, at approximately one-t hird of their appraised value. THE CORRUPT CHERNOGORNEFT BANKRUPTCY 157. Chernogorneft is also located in the Khanty-M ansiysky Autonomous District of Russia which is part of the Tyumen Oblast. 158. In October 1998, the bankruptcy of Chernogorneft was initiated. 159. During the bankruptcy, TNK arranged for the appoi ntment of its handpicked candidate, Vasily Bikin, as the external manager on May 27, 1999. 160. Shortly thereafter, Bikin was replaced with another TNK ally, Alexander Gorshkov (\"Gorshkov\") as the external manager on August 3, 1999. 161. In order to acquire control of the creditor s' committee of Chernogorneft, TNK arranged for Alfa Bank to lend Chernogorneft $15 million in orde r to settle a debt owed to the United States Export-Import Bank (\"Ex-Im Bank\"), providing an illegal preference to the Ex-Im Bank over Chernogorneft's other creditors. 162. Additionally, in order to take control of the creditor's committee of Chernogorneft, TNK arranged for the illegal reduction of the $35 million debt to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (\"EBRD\") to $26 million, providing an illegal preference to the EBRD over Chernogorneft's other creditors. 163. The purpose of this was to remove the Ex-Im Bank and EBRD as creditors, thus strengthening TNK's control over the creditors' committee. 164. At the direction of TNK, Bikin and Gorshkov arranged for the sale of Chernogorneft oil through TNK-controlled entities, which, in turn, directed the oil flows to the Crown Group, at below market prices in order to divert the revenues and profits of Chernogorneft to the Crown Group. 165. Gorshkov later st opped the export of oil in order to cause Chernogorneft to be unable to pay its debts. 166. Following the diversion of profits from Chernogorneft to the Crown Groups, Gorshkov made the determination that Chernogorneft was insolvent and that its assets needed to be sold at auction as soon as possible."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 717 167. The conduct of Gorshkov was so blatantly il legal that his license was revoked by the Federal Service of Russia for Insolvency Proceedings in October 1999. 168.

Not surprisingly, the terms of the aucti on were designed to discourage any persons other than TNK from participating and, in fact, only two bidders attended the auction: TNK and TNK-NV 170. Furthermore, Gorshkov's actions in preparin g the auction essentially precluded other companies from participating in it. 171. For example, despite Sidanco's request for a lis t of assets to be auctioned, Gorshkov refused to provide such, alleging he did not have enough paper on which to print the list. 172. In fact, no requested documents were provided to Sidanco prior to the rigged auction. 173. Ultimately, the auction was held despite severa l decisions of Russian Courts prohibiting the sale, and the assets of Chernogorneft were tr ansferred to TNK-NV at below market prices, including its shares in, Yugraneft which violated Norex's right of first refusal set forth in the Yugraneft shareholders agreement. 174. Norex's interests were, thus, di rectly and adversely affected by the corrupt Chernogorneft bankruptcy because its right of first refusal for Chernogorneft's shares in Yugraneft was violated, and, further, Yugraneft, in which Norex was majority shareholder, di d not receive the oil owed to it by Chernogorneft. SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT'S INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN INTE RESTS TO BLOCK EX-IM BANK'S GUARANTEE OF LOANS TO TNK 175. As a result of the theft of the assets and pr ofits of Kondpetroleum and Chernogorneft through the corrupt bankruptcies, American inve stors in Sidanco took legal action. 176. An action was filed in the Supreme Court of Ne w York against instant Defendants Blavatnik, Access/Renova, and TNK by an investment fund owned, in part, by Harvard. 177. In addition, BP-Amoco initiated a major campaig n in Washington, DC to block Export-Import Bank guarantees of loans to TNK for the purchase of equipment from US manufacturers. 178. Ultimately, by letter dated December 21, 1999, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit E [see Figure 101, page 731] Secretary of State Made leine Albright directed that it would be in the national interest and clearly and importantly advance United States policy if the Ex-Im Bank did not approve the loan guarantee in response to BP-Amoco's complaint about the transparently corrupt nature of the Kondpetroleum and Chernogorneft bankruptcies. 179. As a result of this, BP-Amoco and aligned inte rests settled their dispute with Access, Renova and Alfa, which resulted in the re turn of assets purloined from Ch ernogorneft to Sidanco, although such action did not remedy the harm to Norex and Yugraneft. YUGRANEFT'S DISP UTE WITH TNK YUGRANEFT 180. In October 1991, Yugraneft was formed*. 181. As of 1999, Norex owned 60% of the shares of Yugraneft and Chernogorneft owned 40% of the shares. [Note: Under covert Soviet 'State-Controlled Capitalism', the shares were systematically and by design manipulated into the hands of KGB/GRU operatives ('oligarchs')]. 182. In 1999, an audit of the books and records of Yugraneft determined that Chernogorneft had not contributed the full amount of cap ital to Yugraneft for its 40% share. 183. Ultimately, Chernogorneff s interest in Yugraneft was reduced, based on the determination of the firm's auditors, and, as a result, Norex's interest in Yugraneft increased to 97.3%. 184. During all relevant times, Yugraneft maintained a corporate headquarters in Nizh-Nevartovsk, operating and oil production facilities in the Nizhne vartovsk region, and a representative office in Moscow. *Note: The timing of this corporation's formation makes it clear that the primary geofinancial/commercial factor driving the 'collapse' of the Soviet Union was energy and the need to upgrade the Soviet oil sector."},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"718 A DDENDUM 8: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case THE DISPUTE OVER THE 70,000 TONS 185. In December 1993, Yugraneft lent 300,000 metric tons of oil to Chernogorneft. 186. As of November 1998, the balance of oil ow ed to Yugraneft was 70,000 tonnes of oil. 187. In October 1998, the corrupt bankruptcy wa s initiated against Chernogorneft and by May 1999, an external manager of Chernogorneft controlled by TNK had been appointed. 188. Throughout the bankruptcy proceedings, Yugraneft, while controlled by Norex, attempted to enforce its rights for the return of the oil. 189. Such efforts were unsuccessful. THE DISPUTE OVER THE 102,000 TONS 190. In May 1996. Yugraneft loaned 290,000 metric tons of oil to Nizhnevartovsk Nefte Gaz (\"NNG\"), and owned 38% by TNK (whi ch was yet to be privatized). 191. As of mid-1997, the NNG owed a balance of approximately 102,000 metric tons. 192. In the fall of 1997, corruption proceedings were initiated against NNG in order to remove its then management in order to facilitate the corrupt privatization of TNK and establish full control over NNG. 193. In January 1998, Yugraneft and NNG executed a verification act confirming the amount of oil owed shortly before TNK obtained effective control of NNG, to be about 20,000 tonnes. 194. Subsequently, a person controll ed by TNK was appointed to be the external manager of Nizhnevartovsk Nefte Gaz. 195. During the ensuing two years, Yugraneft attempted to enforce its rights for the return of the oil. 196. Such efforts were unsuccessful. 197. Ultimately, after the illegal seizure of Yugran eft by TNK, this debt was settled for a song. THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN KHAN AND ROTZANG 198. Alexander Rotzang (\"Rotzang\"), the Chairman of the Board of Norex, the majority shareholder of Yugraneft, spoke with Khan while in San Francisco, CA in November 1999. 199. Khan demanded that Yugraneft forg et about repayment of the oil ow ed to it and threatened that if Yugraneft did not forget that, TNK \"would ru n over Yugraneft like a steamroller\" and that \"we eliminate those w ho go against us\". THE AUGUST 2000 MEETING WITH KHAN 200. In August 2000, Lyudmilla Kondrashina (\"Kondrashina\"), the General Director of Yugraneft, met with German Khan (\"Khan\"), an officer of TNK. 201. At that meeting Khan told Kondrashina that Yugraneft should accept 30 % of the value of the 70,000 and 102,000 tons of oil as settlement. 202. Khan threatened Kondrashina that if Yugraneft di d not accept its offer, then Yugraneft would get nothing because TNK has its \"own people at all levels of government\". 203. Yugraneft refused and continued unsuccessfully to try to collect the 70,000/102,000-ton debts. THE JANUARY 2001 MEETING WITH KHAN 204. In January 2001, Kondrashina met again with Khan. 205. Khan warned Kondrashina that unless Yugraneft accepted the offer on the debts of oil that in a few months TNK would take over Yugraneft. 206. Khan also stated that it would be fruitless to pursue litigation because TNK \"controlled\" Russia's Supreme Arbitration Court where comme rcial disputes were ultimately decided. 207. In retrospect it is clear that at this point, Access/Renova and Alfa had agreed upon a plan, which was directed by the Alfa Group on the one hand and Access/Renova, including Blavatnik and Vekselberg in their offices in New York on the other, to take over Yugraneft through corrupted Court proceedings and the use of pure physical force. THE SCHEDULING OF THE YUGRANEFT SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING 208. In May 2001, TNK, through its subsidiary TNK-NV which had purportedly obtained ownership of the shares of Yugraneft from Chernogorneft as a result of the rigged bankruptcy auction, demanded that Yugranef t hold a shareholders' meeting. 209. At the time when the TNK-NV's demand wa s made, neither TNK nor TNK-NV were registered shareholders of Yugraneft. 210. Norex submitted a demand to Yugraneft to hold a shareholders' meeting. 211. The meeting was then sche duled for June 28, 2001."},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 719 THE JUNE 2001 MEETING WITH KHAN 212. In June 2001, Kondrashina met Khan again. 213. Khan bluntly asked Kondrashina to betray the shareholders of Yugraneft. 214. Khan directly asked her how much money she needed to betray Yugraneft. 215. Kondrashina refused the bribe opportunity. 216. Khan then warned her to \"stay in the sha dows\" during the TNK's fight for Yugraneft. THE ILLEGAL TAKEOVER OF YUGRANEFT: The Ex Parte Court Action 217. Just a few days prior to the scheduled Y ugraneft shareholders meeting, on June 25, 2001, TNK, through its subsidiary TNK-NV, file d a complaint in the Russian Courts and petitioned to seize a major portion of the shares of Yugraneft held by Norex. 218. TNK-NV falsely represented that it had obtained legal ownership of shares in Yugraneft from the auction of Chernogorneft's assets - even though the shareholders agree ment between Chernogorneft and Norex provided Norex with the right of first refusal to purchase any shares of Yugraneft offered for sale by Chernogorneft. 210. TNK-NV also falsely represen ted that Norex had been served with the complaint which was required to be filed prior to or with the petition seeking to arrest its shares. 220. On June, 26, 2001, the Russian Court enjoined Norex from voting a major portion of its Yugraneft shares and prohibited Yugraneft from c ounting a major portion of Norex's shares at any shareholders meeting, even though Norex was neve r served or notified of the hearing and TNK-NV was not listed as a shareholder of Yugraneft. 221. Upon information and belief, the proceedings were designed to control illegally the shareholders meeting of Y ugraneft of June 28, 2001. THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING 222. On June 28, 2001, a Yugraneft shareholders' meeting was held at its offices in Moscow. 223. A representative of Norex attended the meeting. 224. No representatives of Chernogorneft, the regi stered owner of the remaining shares of Yugraneft, attended th e meeting, although it had been duly notified. 225. Norex voted its shares which had not been arrest ed in favour of re-elect ing Kondrashina as the general director of Yugraneft. 226. No votes were cast against her re-election. THE FRAUDULENT TAKEOVER OF YUGRANEFT BY BRUTE FORCE 227. On June 29, 2001, TNK took over the o ffices of Yugraneft in Nizhnevartovsk. 228. Alexander Berman, an officer of a TNK affiliate, accompanied by six TNK attorneys and at least 16 thugs wearing military-style fatigues and armed with machine guns, invaded Yugraneft's office in Nizhnevartovsk. 229. Their legal authority was a purported shareholde rs meeting of Yugraneft on June 28 at which Berman was allegedly elected as General Director of Yugranef t, allegedly attended by Norex Petroleum. 230. Such a meeting never took place. 231. On the same day, TNK sent security guar ds to inspect Yugraneft's field operations and, a few days later, on July 6, 2001, TNK security guards armed with handguns and machine guns took over the oil field and field office. 232. The TNK thugs cut off phone and Internet service in order to prevent the Yugraneft employees from communicating with the outside world. 233. On July 17 2001, Simon Kukes the (American-Soviet Academy of Sciences intelligence operative-turned US oil executive) President of TNK, came to Yugraneft's field operations and informed the employees that Yugraneft had been taken over by TNK. 234. He informed them that they were required either to sign employee agreements with TNK, or leave. 235. Amazingly, after the seizure of Yugraneft, Khan admitted in a media interview that TNK decided to take over Yugraneft because it was unwilling to accept the 30% offer for the return of oil owed to Yugraneft."},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"720 A DDENDUM 8: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case THE THREATS BY TNK 236. In July 2001, a Russian Court issued an orde r enjoining Berman from acting as the General Director of Yugraneft. 237. On or about August 1, 2001, Kondrashina, Alexa nder Radov, an attorney for Yugraneft (pre- takeover), together with attorney Alexey Timo shkin, came to the offices of Yugraneft with a Marshal in order to enforce the order. 238. When Radov arrived at the Yugraneft office, one of the leaders of TNK's security stated: \"We know who you are and where you live. Why do you need problems?\" 239. Shortly thereafter, Nam, along with TNK armed thugs, came to Yugraneff s offices. 240. Nam called the local Chief Marshal, who then came to Yugraneft's office, and, instead of enforcing the order, based on the false minutes of the non-existent shareholders' meeting, instructed Kondrashina and the others to leave. 241. During this encounter, Nam picked up the telephone and instructed someone to give orders to J. Paznikov, the chief judge of the Nizh nevartovsk Regional Court to dismiss the Order [verified manipulation of the 'socialist legality judicial' system]. 242. Such an order was entered by J. Paznikov the next day. 243. During this encounter Nam told Kondrashina that she should stop fighting TNK, that TNK controlled the local government and that if she came over to their side that she would be offered the position of Deputy Mayor of Nizhnevartovsk. 244. During the initial part of this encounter, Timosh kin arranged for videotaping of the effort to enforce the order. 245. When Nam arrived, security guards of TNK prevented further videotaping. 246. Later, Mr. Sidorov, the head of TNK's local Security Department, de manded that Timoshkin turn over the videotape. 247. A representative of TNK then offered Timoshkin $ 100,000 for the videotape. 248. When Timoshkin refused the offer, the TNK representative stated, \"Do you have life insurance? You might need it because anything can happen. It might happen that some drunk will meet you near your house and nobody will be able to trace it to anything\". 249. This was an obvious attempt to threaten Timoshkin. 250. Also, after the meeting, Mr. Belevtsov, the ch ief of a TNK Legal Department, asked Radov to \"step outside\". 251. Belevtsov then stated, \"Why do you need thes e problems? Let's talk about your working for TNK\". 252. This was an obvious attempt to threaten and bribe Radov. THE STRIPPING OF YUGRANEFT ASSETS 253. Following the Illegal Takeover, TNK stripped Yugraneft of its assets including rouble denominated bank deposits, dolla r denominated bank deposits, rouble denominated savings certificates (known as \"veksels\" in Russia), and dollar denominated savings certificates. 254. The stripped assets included the transfer of $40 million (including $24 million in dollar denominated accounts) to accounts at Alfa Bank for no apparent consideration. 255. The net result was to strip the cash from Yugraneft and transfer it to Alfa Bank for use by the Defendants. THE FORGED YUGRANEFT CORPORATE DOCUMENTS 256. As part of its justification for the Ille gal Takeover of Yugraneft, TNK-NV produced \"minutes\" of a shareholders meeting which allegedly took place on June 28, 2001 which was allegedly attended by Norex and TNK-NV at whic h the shareholders allege dly voted to re-place Kondrashina with Berman as Yugraneft's General Director. 257. The attendance of Norex was critical for such meeting because without Norex's attendance a quorum would not have been present. 258. Such \"minutes\" were fabricated : Norex never attended such a meeting at which Kondrashina was replaced by Berman as Yugraneft's General Director. THE USE OF ARRANGED CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS 259. In order to deter Norex and the legally elected officers of Yugraneft from opposing the Illegal Takeover of Yugraneft, the Defendants arranged for false criminal proceed ings to be brought against Rotzang, the ch airman of Norex, and Kondrashina, the Gen eral Director of Yugraneft."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 721 260. The use of false criminal proceedings is a typical tool used by corrupt business persons in Russia to wipe out adversaries and is possible because of the generally corrupt nature of Russian Government, particularly at local levels. 261. The false criminal proceedings include an inve stigation of Kondrashina who was alleged by TNK to be embezzling certain Sberbank Savings Certificates, which were in her possession because she was the legitimate Genera l Director of Yugraneft. 262. The purpose of this \"investigation\" was both to intimidate Kondrashina and to use the criminal proceedings for TNK to gain control over the bonds. 263. The false criminal proceedings included the investigation of Rot zang for using savings certificates to pay legitimate debts of Yugraneft. 264. The purpose of this \"investigation\" was to bot h intimidate Rotzang and to use the criminal proceedings for TNK to gain control over the certificates. 265. The false criminal proceedings were instigated by TNK and were designed to intimidate persons from cooperating with No rex and Kondrashina, the legitimate Gen eral Director of Yugraneft. THE ROLE OF TNK AND THE CROWN GROUP IN REGARD TO THE SALE OF YUGRANEFT OIL AFTER THE ILLEGAL TAKEOVER 266. Subsequent to the Illegal Takeover of Yugran eft, oil from Yugraneft has been converted and sold by TNK and the Crown Group. 267. Yugraneft oil for the Russian market has been converted and sold through TNK. 268. Yugraneft oil for the foreign markets ha s been converted and sold through TNK and the Crown Group and substantial revenues [has been] received by them via wires through banks in the United States. THE SLUSH FUND AND MASSIVE TAX FRAUDS 269. After its takeover of TNK, the Alfa and Access/Renova sides arra nged for all petroleum exported by TNK to be sold through Crown Enterprise. 270. The trading between TNK and the Alfa/Crown a ffiliates was designed for TNK to sell product at a greatly lowered price in order to transfer the profits from Russia to offshore structures controlled by Access/Renova Groups and Alfa. 271. This resulted in a massive tax fraud on the Ru ssian Government and the improper diversion of profits from TNK to Alfa/Crown, to the detriment of TNK's other shareholders, including the Russian Government from 1997 through 1999. 272. In order to effect this aspect of the Illegal Scheme, Access/Renova and Alfa/Crown, through Astons, established offshore companies which we re purportedly independen t from TNK but which Access/Renova and Alfa secretly controlled. 273. These companies included the Slush Fund Companies. 274. The Slush Fund Companies would send invoices for fabricated services to Crown Group companies. 275. In return, the Crown Group companies wired tens of millions of dollars to the Slush Fund Companies through banks in the United States. 276. One effect of the Slush Fund was to hide the f act that profits were diverted from TNK to the Crown Group. 277. A second effect of the Slush Fund was to creat e a fund which was used to pay salary and bonuses to members of the Conspiracy, including Spitz. 278. Spitz, through Futura, personally received m illions of dollars through the Slush Fund. 279. Upon information and belief, a third effect of th e Slush Fund was to create a fund used to pay bribes to Russian Government officials. 280. A critical aspect of the Illegal Scheme was worldwide tax evasion, which permitted some Defendants to keep a much larger portion of the pr ofits than would have occurred if all income was properly declared and all taxes properly paid. 281. Thus, these Defendants accumulated tremendous w ealth which was used to effect further acquisitions and, upon information and belief, br ibe Russian Government officials, all in furtherance of the Illegal Scheme."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"722 A DDENDUM 8: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case The Crown Commodities UK Tax Fraud 282. Defendants created a plan by which Crown Trad e and Finance Limited, which was based in Gibraltar, would purportedly act as a prin cipal in its trading with TNK's oil. 283. In fact, Crown Trade and Finance Limited was a mere shell corporation, as all real trading was done in London by Crown Commodities. 284. Nonetheless, Crown Commodities falsely repres ented to the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom that it was merely acting as a service agent for Crown Trade and Finance Limited so that it could limit its profits to 10% of its costs. 285. Crown Commodities, acting as a principal with regard to all trading of petroleum sourced from the TNK, should have been liable in the United Kingdom for taxes on the worldwide income earned from its trading. The activities of the Gibraltar office were limited to literally rubber- stamping contracts with a rubbe r stamp signature facsimile. 286. As a result of the United Kingdom tax fraud, Crown Commodities avoided over $30 million in taxes and penalties. 287. Ultimately, upon information and belief, Crown Commodities' function may have been replaced with Crown Resources AG, which registered a branch in England in order to continue the same illegal activities, much in the same way as previously conducted. The Crown Management US and UK Tax Fraud 288. Crown established a system by which it only reported base sala ries for its management, such as Spitz and Kuzmichev. 289. Such base salaries were suppl emented by periodic bonus paymen ts made to offshore accounts established by Astons and controlled by manage ment, including Eastmount Properties, which was controlled by Kuzmichev, as evidenced by the ema il attached hereto [included with the documents], and Futura, which was c ontrolled by Spitz. 290. Upon information and belief, such income wa s never declared for tax purposes by Crown employees, such as Kuzmichev in the United Kingdom or Spitz in the United States. The Sham Invoice Fraud 291. Pursuant to certain contracts between TNK and Crown, Crown purported to act as an agent for TNK, responsible for accounting for the profits which it made on trading to TNK. 292. In practice, it was intended for Crown to act as a principal and for all trading profits to accrue to Crown. 293. In order to conceal the real trading profits, Crown and TNK adopted a plan called \"Rondo\" by which Crown would issues sham invoices for the sale of petroleum, as evidenced by [an email attached which, along with other documents, was annexed]. 294. This plan involved the initial sale of petroleum received by Crown from TNK to a third party at an agreed-upon lower price. 295. A copy of this sham invoice was then submitt ed to TNK for institutionalised accounting and tax evasion purposes. 296. In the meantime, Crown arrange d for a second transaction by which the third party would resell the petroleum to Crown at this lowered price, and then Crown would resell the petroleum to the third party at a higher, market price. 297. The effect of this plan was to hide the true profit and price actually received by Crown from the sale of petroleum received from TNK to the detriment of its non Access/Renova and Alfa shareholders, including American shareholders of TNK controlled companies and the Russian Government which was a shareholder of TNK. 298. This plan also perpetrated a tax (as well as customs) fraud on Russia because the true profit from the sale of oil was transferred from TNK to a Crown company located outside of Russia such as the UK (and the profit was then transferred to one of the Slush Fund Companies through the invoices for fabricated services). The Diverted Address Commissions 299. In the oil brokerage business, it is normal bus iness practice for traders, such as the Crown Groups, to arrange for the charter of vessels with shipbrokers. 300. It is also normal for the shipbrokers to pay an \"address commission\" of a percent of the cost of the vessel charter to the trader, for selecting such shipbroker. 301. Such address commission is normally 1 to 2 pe rcent of the cost of chartering the vessel. 302. In order to divert f unds to the Slush Fund Companies, th e Crown Group arranged with shipbro kers, such as Simpson Spence & Young (\"Simpson\"), which has offices in Stamford, Connecticut and"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"THE NEW UNDERWORLD ORDER 723 London, England, to strike the \"address commission\" pr ovision from its agreements and, instead, pay the address commissions to various Slush Fund Compan ies controlled by Defendants, including East-m ount, Ringford Trading Limited and Fulbrook Trading Limited. 303. The diversion of such payments also operate d as a tax fraud on the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom because the true income of Crown was understate d and the true incomes of the Defendants, such as Spitz, who received bonus payments from this fund were understated. 304. Upon information and belief, such payments amounted to tens of millions of dollars. THE ENTERPRISES 305.

THIS CASE PROVES THAT THE RUSSIAN 'PRIVATISAT ION' PHASE WAS LENINI ST, THEREFORE FALSE In successive issues of Soviet Analyst from the early 1990s onwards, the Author argued that since the Soviet operatives and Party-State apparatchiks were all steeped in Leninist dec eption ideology, their 'free enterprise' and 'privatisation' offensive from 1991 onwards could not be relied upon to be genuine.

THE UNFOUNDED COMPLACENCY OF WESTERN OIL COMPANIES Having generally fallen for the Soviet lies surrounding 'collapsible Communism', US and British oil corporations assumed that the energy assets of the 'former' Soviet Bloc would be accessible. This was true, but what they did not understand was that this would happen only on Soviet terms, for modernisation purposes. The KGB/GRU 'oligarchs' predictably cont rolled this giga-scam in pursuit of long-term strategic objectives, which were always obvious to any observer whose understanding was not blinded by commercial considerations and greed - namely, to entice Western oil companies and peripheral servic e organisations into the 'posf-Soviet oil sector, so that the West would pay for upgrading the industry. The assets were always certain to be 'clawed back' by the Leninist 'Party-State' - the structures of whic h remained in place, 'working by other means' [Lenin]. Remember that at the 'higher' llluminati control le vel, Marxism-Leninism is simply the dial ectical opposite of Fascism, the contrived geopolitical instruments invented by the 'two Karls' in Germany. Of course the 'mainstream' media, financed in part by intelligence-controlled 'funny money', missed the cue. ■"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"728 A DDENDUM 8: Soviet Criminalism: The Norex Case COUNT 1: Violation of RICO §1962(a) Norex v.

The point is that it act ually takes a moment's thought to extend the two fingers in question, which means that this salute ca nnot be delivered casually: it has to be a conscious act. ft is not known whether Prince William, pictured here by Reuters, knew what he was doing, or whether this was just an instance of youthful silliness.

The diabolical graphics of this album cover are not fully shown here: but the rest of the cover displays the word Dio in demonic lettering which, when reversed in the mirror, spells Devil. This reflects the fact that the Devil turns everything back to front, and upside down. The llluminati have no solution to anything, and their only product is death, procured via open-ended confusion - the Devil being the author of all confusion; 9: King Abdullah of Jordan finds it necessary to display the 'horned hand', or 'Devil's Salute' signal as he greets GRU-President Vladimir Putin; 10: The 'mano figo' a.k.a. 'fica gesture', is bot h a crude insult called the diablo symbol, and a satanic signal, an imagined defence against the evil eye (of Lucifer, also called the 'All-Seeing Eye'), and additionally, a sexual signal; 11: The 'mano comuto', a.k.a. the Devil's triad, 'ilcomuto', 'cornuto', the horn, the horned Devil, the twin-homed salute, the horned hand, the 'Devil's Salute', and the 'Devil Horn Salute'. When the 'mainstream' US media actually noticed that the President of the United States, his wife and a daughter had seen fit to display these Satanic hand gestures duri ng the Inauguration on 20th Ja nuary 2005, a cover story was retailed for public consumption to the effect that the hand signal represents the 'Hook 'em Horns' gesture used by the fans of the University of Texas Longhorns. Th is 'line' was disseminated by Associated Press (which acts more or less as a US state news agency nowadays) and CNN - despite conclusive evidence, supported by academic authorities, that this gesture represents a celebration of, and a sign of obeisance to, the Devil, Satan, the Evil One. Beyond that, if the Texas University Longhoms perform this signal routinely, they salute the Devil routinely, too. Whether fans do this wittingly or not is irrelevant: that's what they are doing. In his Inauguration speech, President Bush proclaimed: 'B y our efforts, we have lit... a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those w ho fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world'. What does this Luciferian statement mean in translation from the language of the hof-Illuminati? It rejoices in setting fires, which is a central preoccupation of the possessed and those in thrall to Lucifer - who, as the Au thor's late and dear friend Malachi Martin confirmed [page 7] 'have all passed through [initiation] that involves three things: the infliction of pain without flinching, the infliction of death without flinching, and the use of fi re'. For initiates, the deaths in Iraq and those in New Orleans are just 'c ollateral damage'. ■"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"734 A DDENDUM 10: Geomasonic Illuminati handshakes ADDENDUM TEN: Global Analyst 1,5: May 2004 GEOMASONIC HANDSHAKE SIGNALS GEOMASONIC HANDSHAKES: THE GRIPS OF THE BROTHERHOOD' In the following sequence of pictures, taken from old press clippings (as reflected in their quality), some conspicuous geomasonic handshakes ('grips') are identified.

G: SIGN OF A FELLOW CRAFT WITHOUT DUE GUARD, WHICH IS WHAT AMERICANS DO WHEN SALUTING THE FLAG AND STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM "},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"738 322: S EE M ARK C HAPTER 3, VERSE 22 'AS ABOVE, SO BELOW In the mentally unstable and certifiable Luciferian occult construct in which the Masonic llluminati operate, when the 'Orphic Egg' [see page XXXI] of 'Ancient Mysteries' mythology in the universe is 'broken', there are f ound to be three (3) energies, or 'phanes', resid ent within it. This is all luna tic, fantastic tripe and nonsense; but it is what these idiotic generational occultists 'profess' to believe. The first of these 'phanes' is called three (or the letter I fo r Invisible or the Eye of the occultic all-seeing presence, i.e. of Lucifer: see the MI5 symbol in Figure 1 on page 3). Energy supposedly 'released' when the egg is 'broken' (exactly WHO breaks it is left unstated) remains, in the case of three where it is, As Above - while the other two 'phanes' or 'forces' descend to Earth, As Below. This 'A s Above, So Below' gibberish is replicated in the common occult notion that God is both good and evil, and that Satan is part of him [s ee Figure 102 below]. This is ludicrously inconsistent with the parallel gibberish (or clashing lie) call ed Deism, which postulates fals ely that God sleeps, so it is the privilege of the llluminati to 'manage' the mec hanistic universe that God created, before he fell asleep. On Earth, the 'released' energy has split or metamo rphosed into good against evil and evil against good. This is called 322, the presence of the god 3 in harmony ('As Above'), and the 2 mechanistic opposing 'seething energies' (22) released, and fighting for supremacy ('As Below*). When an orchestrated revoluti on, for instance, has been completed, 3, or harmony, is all that remains on Earth, 'As Above' (although, again, it is left unstated how 3 suddenly 'descends' to earth: presumably it 'fills the gap' left by the two self-destruct ed mechanistic 'energies', or 'phanes' - which will have fought each other to annihilation). Translated from this mad nonsense into the contemporary global environment, the two competing 'phanes' that are struggling for power are two dialectical factions with in the llluminati - one being represented by the pan-German Nazi llluminati 'line' (in geomasonic terms, the llluminati-penet -rated Grand Orient), and the other being the 'Scottish' Rite llluminati 'line' espoused by the (hated) and also equ ally deluded 'Anglo-Saxons'. Ot her 'dialectics' include the separate German Nazi-Zionazi conflict, and the rivalry/cooperation between the KGB and Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst (DVD), Dachau. Since the protagonists live in an occult environment at various stages of actual or prospective demonic possession, this Luciferian, invented pyramid of fantastic lies is, for them, reality; and since the factions of the sect of the llluminati have penetrated the intelligence communities and certain structures of the key governments - on behalf of Satan, father of death - the havoc these evil people are consciously inflicting upon the world appears, for the time being, to have no limit. Their world is mechanistic although they profess to believe in good and evil, this is a fe int, since in a mechanistic world, everything is deterministic, with no distinct ion between good and evil accordingly being possible. Purs uant to this fundamental lie, they call evil good, and good evil, contrary to the Word of God thr ough Isaiah: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight' [Isaiah, Chapter 5, verses 20-21]. The sole product of these people is death: t hey are all themselves spiritually en r oute to death. Death is what 'they do'. As they know that they t hemselves are doomed, their preoccupation is to bring everyone else down to the pit of perdition, with them. The obsession of some of thes e people with population reduction and mass slaughter - the false rationale being that this is the only way to 'save the planet' - is directly related to demonic infestation. They are indeed the most dangerous people on earth, regardi ng all casualties as 'collateral damage'. Since, for the llluminati, the occult mental state of decay into which they have fallen is reality, everything that is normal i s unreal, expendable, ephemeral, transitional, temporary and ripe for 'change'. And having 'ascended' by Luciferian ritual initiations, they claim to have acquired 'authority' to reorder the 'mechanistic' world in accordance with their idea of 'what is best for Man', i.e. for the Brotherhood of the llluminati. These are the same people who saw that Jesus Christ threatened their hegemony. He always will. Which is why True Christians are the llluminati's 'Main Enemy', and why Weishaupt and many of his successors have acknowledged that the destruction of (TRUE) Christianity (which is impossible) is the 'top priority'. ■ Figure 102: This occult illustration shows the two interlaced triangles used today by Zionism as the (false) 'Star of David'. The image explains remarks by the llluminati archivist Albert Lantoine [see below] that Satan is an equal and indispensable part of God, as seen when the revolting picture is reversed. This is the meaning of 'What is above equals what is below', a.k.a. 'As Above, So Below'. This common occult idea that God is both good and ev il, so that Satan is part of God, is a kabbalistic lie which suits the llluminati because it justifies their ruthlessness, covetousness, lies and murderous behaviour generally. It is reported that Lantoine told Pope Pius XII in August 1943 that 'the deat h of Satan will mark the agony of your God. You must accept allianc e with Satan, and admit that he completes God.

How art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will ascend above the heights of the cl ouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the pit.... Thou art cast out of thy grave, like an abominable branch... That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, that opened not the house of [the] prisoners'. [Isaiah, Chapter 13, verses 12- 15,19 and 17]. Giuseppe Mazzini, the drug-dealing Illuminist founder of the contemporary mafia, and reprobate colleague of the Satanist Magus Albert Pike, referred to the Pope as the 'Papal Caesar'. 'Here is wisdom. Let him that hath unde rstanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred three-score and six' [Revelation, Chapter 13, verse 18]. The beast, whose number kaballistically- numerologically is 666, translates as Lateinos, or 'the Latin kingdom', the number of which (in Latin) is 616 (devolving to 13, the 'magick' number of the Illuminati). As John's follower Polycarp knew, Lateinos stood for the God-Caesar referred to by Mazzini. Herein lies the essence of the double-mindedness of the Illuminati, of which there can be no doubt that the Vatican is the central locus. For it is in the Vatican - where a man 'representing' Jesus Christ, and at times referring to himself or allowing himself to be worshipped as though he IS Jesus Christ - utters empty, soothing words in a specially contrived manner of speaking, preoccupied with the interests of the worldly church-organisation - that nuns murder Popes with poisoned champagne, as though this procedure were nothing unusual: which is the case, given that Gregory V (996-999), Damasus II (1048), Celesrine II (1143), Leo XI ( 1605), numerous cardinals and Alexander Borgia all died from poisoning, the Illuminati's preferred liquidation method. Pope John Paul I died in late September 1978 with his mouth gaping so wide in agony, that the four embalming brothers Signoracci from the Medical Institute were unable to close it for the duration of Vatican's usual death-fest - since death is the geomasonic Illuminati's only product. This is proclaimed by one of the Illuminati's own dogmatic assertions: 'Anyone who reveals our secrets, voluntarily or involuntarily, signs his own death warrant'. Figure 103: Rochus Misch, a member of Hitler's innermost entourage - who turned out to be the last person to leave the bunker alive - is shown relaxing and enjoying the scenery in the restaurant car of Hitler's train, the name of which was Amerika. That the Fuhrer named hi s train Amerika reveals the essence of the Nazis' global hegemony strategy. Had the Third Reich conquered Europe, it would have target ed the United States - the total takeover of which remains the German Nazi Continuum's overriding objective. Figure 104: Hezbollah terrorists performing the Hitler Salute in Southern Lebanon in July 2006 [Associated Press]. When this image appeared in the British press, no reference was made to the whole point of the photograph - namely that these terrorists were clones of Hitler's stormtroopers and brainwashed Thir d Reich supporters. The reason they are all performing the Hitler Salute is that Hezbollah, Iran and Syria are secret operations of D eutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, Dachau - the 'Black' Nazi strategic Continuum."},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"740 FUR UNS DER KRIEG IST NIEMALS VORBEI The renegade Jesuit Jew, Adam Weishaupt, a nd his associates resolved, with the formal- isation of the sect of the Illuminati on the pagan feast of Beltane (1st May) 1776, to put into effect the programme that they had revealed in Munich a year earlier - to form and control public opinion by all means available, to insinuate its adepts into the entourages of rulers and wielders of power and influence, to usurp such power whenever feasible, to covet and procure control over the assets of the wealthy, raw materials, and finance, to degrad e and destroy all formal religions and institutions including the family, en route to targeting private property, and finally to take over the Papacy - placing agents of its own in the so-called Chair of Peter (which is itself a deception, since Peter was never in Rome: see Galatians, Chapter 2, verse 7). Just about a century later, the Illuminati Magus Albert Pike developed his diabolical programme for three conflagrations. The third of these, exploiting Islam - the dialectical Antithesis of the formal religion of God-Caesar - is being leveraged for the Illuminati's agentur by criminalised elem ents of intelligence communities, which are implementing the Dluminati's mad, anti-nation state, global hegemony programme. Masking their abominations behind the cover provided by the Illuminati and its 'sib' 'Protocols' blueprint (which, not least the 'explosions from below' confirm is being implemented today, to the letter), the Dachau-based German Nazi occultic Continuum, Deutsche Verteidi gungs Dienst, with its serpent's head resident on the territory of the 'Main Enemy'*, the United States, makes common cause with the 'beas' in pursuit of its idolatry of global control. But the 'Availing Time' is very short. 'For the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders. And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be save d. And for this cause, God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness' [2 Thessalonians, Chapter 2, verses 7-12]. So the global control clique, riven by jealousy and hatred, cannot succeed Those who persist with this global hegemony idolatry, who covet control of vast financial resources, all who pervert and corrupt little children - those maddened fools who have said in their heart 'there is no God', save Lucifer - need to be reminded that 'the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and so rcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone' [Revelation, Chapter 21, verse 8]. This, rather than the idiocy of reincarnation, is what awaits these creatures. As for the rest of us, we need to remind ourselves of the wise words of David, the Psalmist: 'Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb' [Psalm 37, verses 1 and 2]; and: 'I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found' [Psalm 37, verses 35 and 36]. And to prevail, we must 'put on the whole armour of God, that [we] may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places' [Ephesians, Chapter 6, verses 11 and 12] - as illustrated in this work. ■ * Following the Second World War, the German Geopolitical Centre which had been established in the 1940s in Madrid, perfected a nd implemented its 'Blowback' operation against 'the Main Enemy', Britain and America. While Britain was enticed and entrapped in the Nazis' long-range strategic deception operation now calling itself the Euro pean Union, the United States was targeted via 'Operation P aperclip' and the consolidation of a massive Nazi penetration of US inte lligence, the universities and m ilitary-industrial /official struc tures. The head of the Abwehr, Admiral Canaris - protected by the disinformation lie that he had been hanged naked on 9th April 1945 at Flossen burg - surfaced with a large contingent of Nazis in Oklahoma, using the alias Samuel Randall Pittman, or Pittmann. The records of this Nazi penetration were destroyed in the Murrah Building as a result of the Oklahoma Bombing. After Canaris fell ill in 1976, his plac e as head of the 'Gehlen Organisation', by now the secret Nazi 'Black' agency, Deutsche Verteidigungs Dienst, Dachau, was temporarily tak en by the alleged multiple operative Dr Henry Kissinger, who allegedly ceded it to George H. W. Bush (real name ?: Scherff) in 1978. The DVD has ruthlessly adhered to the principles enunciated in the 'Madrid Circular Letter' of 'building the Thousand-Year Reich on the Ruins of the United States' and 'fur uns der Krieg its niemals vorbei'. ■"}]
