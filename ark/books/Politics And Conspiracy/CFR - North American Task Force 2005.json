U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada account s for alm ost one-third of total U.S. trade. U.S. trade with its North American ne igh bors substan tially exce eds its trade with the European Union, and with Japan and Chin a com bined. In the energy sector, Canada and Mexico are now the two largest exporters of oil to the United States. Canada alone supplies the United States with over 95 pe rcent of its imported natural gas and 100 percent of its im ported electri city. In 2005, the borders betw een Canada, Mexico, and the United States will be cro ssed alm ost 400 m illion tim es. North Am erica has b ecom e m ore than a free trade zone or an expression of geography. We are three liberal democracies, comm itted to protecting individual rights , upholding the rule of law, ensu ring equality of opportunity for our citizens, and achieving a reason able balance b etween the m arket and the state. The ever-deepening integration of North Am erica prom ises enorm ous benefits for its citizens. These benefits, however, are neith er inevitable n or ir reve rsib le. The pro cess of change must be properly m anaged. As governm ent offic ials, we wrestled on a daily basis with the challenges that North Am erica c onfronts. Now, as private citizens, we are able to reflect m ore system atically on these challenges a nd to articulate a long-term vision of how to m eet them .

Eleven years ago, the North A merican Free Trad e Agreem ent (NAFTA) liberalized trade and investm ent in m ost sectors, prov ided cr ucial protections for intellectual property, created pi oneering dispute-resolution mechanisms, and established new procedures for enforcing labor and environm ental standa rds. Since then, NAFTA has accelerated commercial exchange in North Am erica, helping to unlock the reg ion’s econom ic potential and de monstrating that nati ons with different levels of developm ent can negotiate comm ercial arrangem ents. To build o n the adva nces of the past decade and to craft an agenda for the future, w e propose the creation by 2010 of a community to enhance security, prosperity, and oppo rtunity for all North Americans. To that end, we propose a community based on th e prem ise that each m ember benefits from its neighbor’s su ccess and is dim inished by its problem s. The boundari es of the community would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer secu rity perim eter. W ithin this ar ea, the m ovement of people and products would be legal, or derly, and safe. The overarching goal is to guarantee a free, safe, just, a nd prosperous North Am erica. What We Face Today, our nations face three common challenges. 1. Shared security threa ts . Over the last de cade , terro rist and crim inal activ ity ha s underscored North America’s vuln erability. All of the 9/1 1 terro rists succeeded in entering the United S tates directly f rom out side North Am erica, but the arrest of a person in 1999 trying to cross the Canadian-U.S. border as pa rt of a plot to bom b the Los Angele s airpo rt sh ows that ter roris ts a lso will try to gain ac cess to the United States through Canada and Mexico. Hundred s of thousands of people cross illegally into the United States each year an d both Canada and Mexico also m ust deal with persistent flows of undo cum ented immigrants. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Failure to secure the ex ternal borders of North Am erica will inh ibit th e legitim ate move ment of people and goods within the con tinent, to our collective detrim ent. Afte r the 9/11 attacks, delays at the Cana dian-U.S. border prompted unplanned parts shortages in both countries, cos ting m anufact uring facilities m illions o f dollars an hour. These downstream consequences m ean that Canada and Mexico have an overrid ing comm ercial interes t in in creas ing North Am erican security, a part from any other considerations. In additi on, future terrorist assaults co uld target sites in any of the th ree co untries, and even an attack ai med exclus ively at an Am erican city o r insta llation could sp ill over to Me xico or Canada. The reality of North Am erican inte rdepend ence is tha t all th ree co untries m ust work together to ensure the security of the contin ent. Beyond terrorism , international crim inal activity poses a continuing threat to public safety in the region. Perhaps m ost notable in this regard is drug- and gang- related v iolence along th e Mexican-U.S. fron tier. Because th ese th reats cross bord ers, they cannot be addressed adequate ly by any one governm ent alone. Failure to address security issues will ultim ately underm ine gains on other fronts. In the North Am erican context, failu re to collab orate effectively to address security issues will have a direct im pact o n co mm ercial relationships , as well as on our freedom s and quality of life. 2. Shared challenges to enha nce our competitiv eness. Over the las t decade na tion s around the world, from China to India to La tin Am erica to the expanded m embership of the European Union, have becom e incr easingly integrated into the global m arket. NAFTA dr am atically spurred th e pace of econom ic integration within North Am erica, but we need to address issu es that tod ay place burdensom e restraints on ou r ability to co mpete. Unwieldy rules of origin, increasing con gestion at p orts of entry , and regulatory differences am ong the three countries raise our costs instead of reducing them. Trade in natural resources, foodstuffs, and other key areas—including the crucial energy sector—rem ains far from free. Finally, the NAFTA partners have been unable to resolve a num ber of im porta nt trade and investm ent disputes, which have created friction in ou r comm ercial relationsh ips. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 3. Shared interest in broad-based development. W hile trade and investm ent flows have increased dram atically am ong our thre e countries, the deve lopm ent gap between Mexico and its two northern neighbors ha s widened. This disparity underm ines cooperation on areas of common interest and gives rise to regional problem s. Low wages and lack of econom ic opportunity in parts of Mexico stim ulate undocum ented imm igration and contribute to hum an suff ering, which som etim es translates into crim inality and violenc e. As a matter of their own national interests , all three countries should do more to encourage broad-based econom ic developm ent in Mexico. These challenges require urgent atten tion. Although North Am erica rem ains the world’s eco nom ic powe rhouse, increasing global com petitio n could underm ine its long- run prosperity. What We Can Do Trinational collaboration is e ssential to ensure regional pr osperity and security. Although there are som e issues where bilateral coope ration has historically been m uch more intense—such as U.S.-Canad ian military-to-m ilitary coop eration—there are m any more issues f or w hich a trin ational approach would be beneficial. Shared concerns range from regiona l ec onom ic competitiv enes s to law enf orcem ent, f rom energy secur ity to regulatory policy, from dispute reso lution to continental defense. North Am erica, m oreover, is quite differe nt from other regions of the world and must find its own cooperative route forward. A new North Am erican community will not be m odeled on the European Union or the Euro pean Commission, nor will it aim at the creation of any sort of vast supranational bureaucracy. Ou r vision of North Am erica is one of three sovereign states who se for mal collabo ration m ust reflect their m utual interdepend ence while respecting th eir d ifferences. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" We focus our recomm endations on the creation of a single econom ic s pace that expands the econom ic opportunities for all people in the regi on, and the establishm ent of a secu rity zone th at p rotects the region fr om exte rnal th reats while facilita ting the legitim ate passage of goods, people, and capital. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" We m ake six key recom mendations: 1. Create the institutions necessary to sustain a North American community. We propose that the trinational summ it becom e a regular event. Annual summ it m eetings am ong the three countries of North Am erica will dem onstrate the strategic im portance of the North Am erican comm un ity. We propose further the establishm ent of a North Am erican A dvisory Cou ncil to prepare and m onitor action to im plem ent the decisions m ade at these summ its. 2. Immedia tely create a unified Nort h American Border Action Plan. The threat of inte rnational terror ism origin ates, f or the most part, outside of North Am erica. Our extern al bo rders are a critic al line of defense against this threat. Any weakness in contro lling access to North Am erica from abro ad reduces the securi ty of the contin ent as a whole and exacerb ates th e pressure to intensify controls over intracontinental movem ent and traffic, which increas es the tr ansaction cos ts associated with trade and trave l with in North Am erica. The governm ents of Ca nada, Mexico, and the United States should articulate as their long-range goal a comm on security peri meter for North Am erica. In particular, the three governm ents should strive toward a situation in which a terrorist trying to penetr ate o ur borders will have a n equally h ard tim e doing so no m atter which country he elects to en ter first. Like free trad e a decade ago, a common security perim eter f or North Americ a is an am biti ous b ut ach ievab le goal th at will require specific policy, statutory, and procedural ch anges in all thr ee nations, including: • Harm onization of visa and asylum re gulations, including convergence of the list of “visa waiver” countries; • Harm onization of entry screening a nd tracking procedures for people, goods, and vessels (including integrat ion of nam e-based and biom etric watch lists ); • Harm onization of exit and e xport-tracking procedures; • Full sharing of data about the ex it an d entry of foreign na tion als; 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" • Joint inspection by the thr ee countries of container traffic entering North Am erican p orts, bu ild ing on th e Co ntainer Secu rity In itiativ e between the United States and Canada; and • A comm itment to a common approach to inte rna tiona l negotiations r elated to global m ovem ent of people, cargo, and vessels. Enhance law enforcement cooperation . The security cooperation of the three countries should also extend to cooperation on counterterr orism and law enforcem ent and could include th e estab lishm ent of a tr inationa l th reat- inte llig ence center, the developm ent of trinational ba llistics and explosives regist ration, and joint training for law enforcem ent officials from the three countries, am ong other m easures. Rapid progress in trilateral law enforcem ent coopera tion will be possibl e only insofar as the respec tive governm ents protec t th e integr ity of their pub lic institu tion s and root ou t any system ic corruption that m ay exist. Expand defense cooperation. In addition to streng thening cooperatio n am ong counterterrorism and law enforce ment agencies in all three countries, it is essential to build on the strong foundation of the contin ent’s existing milita ry agreem ents. The most im portant step is to expand th e binational North Am erican Aeros pace Defense Comm and (NORAD) to m ake it a m ultiser vice Canadia n-U.S. comm and with a mandate to protec t the m aritim e as well as air approach es to Nor th Am erica. In addition, Canada and the Unit ed States should invite Me xico to consider m ore extens ive infor mation-sharing an d co llaborative plann ing involving m ilitary organizations to build mutual trust and pe rhaps pave the way fo r m ore cooperation in the f uture. 3. Adopt a common exte rnal tariff. We recommend that the three governm ents begin by harmoniz ing extern al tariffs on a sector-by-sector basi s to the lowes t prev ailing rate con sistent with m ultilateral obligati ons. They should begin with goods on which curren t tariffs are clos est, then proceed to close larger gaps, with the goal over tim e of adopting a comm on external tariff, thus elim inating th e need for com plex and cos tly rules of origin. W e recommend that the thr ee countries enter into negotiations in an effort to f ind a joint app roach to unf air trade p ractices and a nti-com petitive behavio r, 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" including dum ping. We call fo r creating a perm anent rost er of panelists for the NAFTA ad hoc dispu te-resolu tion panels to im prove cons istency, pr edic tability, and efficiency. The three countries sho uld accelerate and expand im ple mentation of existing “sm art border” action plans to facilitate intra–No rth Am erican travel and commerce. The three countries sh ould develo p a secure North American Bord er Pass w ith biometric identifiers . This document would allow it s bearers expedited passage through custom s, i mmigration, and airport security throughout the region. Over the longer term , it should be possible to reth ink fundam entally the system s for national contro l of intracon tinen tal trav el and trade. This will be particular ly true if the three countries make genuine progress toward es tablishing a com mon security perim eter. North Am erica is different from Europe, of course, but it is instructive that th e members of the European Union have m anaged large ly to elim inate physical border controls. The governments of C anada, Mexico, and the United States shou ld commit themselves to the lo ng-term goal of dramatical ly dimin ishing the need for the current intensity of the go vernment s’ physical c ontrol of tr affic, trave l, and trade within North America . 4. Stimulate economic grow th in Mexico. To realize the f ull be nefits of econom ic integration, and to ensure that these bene fits are distributed broadly, Mexico m ust increase an d sustain a rate of gro wth comm ensurate with its deve lopm ent goals . Mexico m ust devise a set of policies that comm ands broad public support and decide on the steps it will take to attract investm ent and stim ulate growth. In conjunction, the United States and Canada should support Mexico by establis hing a North American Investment Fund to create infrastructure to link th e poorer parts of th e country to the markets in the north, and to support edu cation and technical training for Mexican states and m unicipalities comm itted to tran sparency and new development. The fund should be seen as a producti ve investm ent by all three countries in the future com petitiveness of North Am erica’s econom ic zone. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 5. Develop a North American energ y and na tural-resource security strategy. A reliable supply of key natural resources is essential to the region’ s long-term security and prosperity, while respecting each country ’s individual po licies and priorities. To that end, the three governm ents should devel op a com prehensive joint plan to expand and protect energy infrastructu re, fully dev elop continen tal reserves, conserve fossil fuels, and reduce em issions. Ultim ately, re gional collaboration on conservation and em issions could for m the basis for a North Am erican alternative to the Kyoto Protocol. 6. Deepen educational ties . Given its historical, cultural, political, and econom ic ties, North Am erica should have the largest educ ational-exchange netw ork in the world. We recommend the expansion of scholarship and exchange program s for students at both the secondary and university levels, the developm ent of a network of Centers for North Am erican Studies in all three countri es, and cross-border training program s for elem entary- and seconda ry-school teachers. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" TASK FORCE CHAIRS J OHN P.
