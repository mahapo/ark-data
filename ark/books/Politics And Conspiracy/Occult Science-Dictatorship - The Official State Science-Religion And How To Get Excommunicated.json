These combined forces manu facture opinion and co ntrol most thought in our society, making it difficult for innovative individuals to express divergent scientific vi ews without being virtua lly burned at the stake as \"heretics\" by quasi-religious sc ientific thought-control zombies, who have fallen victim to the pressu re to believe the science that Big Brother wants them to. In Occult Ether Physics (1997, 1998), Space Aliens From the Pentagon (1993, 1996), and Pentagon Aliens (1999), I expounded on and documented the most importa nt discovery in science, Nikola Tesla's electrodynamic space propuls ion. Tesla and his work were literally buried by Relativism, especially after 1919. I also exposed some paradoxes of Relati vism, and have apparent ly had a significant influence beyond the cred it afforded me, both in the UFO and the free-energy fields (which ar e really the same fields). The motive for the Occult Scie nce Dictatorship , which first began with the establishment of media-promoted Relativism, was to suppress, ridicule and con ceal ether physics and free energy discoveries by the monopolist-owne d media giants who obliterated Tesla's name, because he had made so many important free energy discoveries. They also purged th e ether physics through which Tesla had realized his elect rodynamic space propu lsion method. This discovery threatened th e \"energy-heart\" of pe rpetual security and control by the monopolies. Energy cont rol was the cash cow that the monopolies relied on for continuity. He who threatened to sever the lines of energy depend ency, threatened the flow of cash into the pockets of the monopolies, an d had to be eliminated.

With gasoline and fuel prices ge nerally at an al l-time high, and California in an artificially-creat ed energy crunch, the oil giants proposed to drill in the pristine Alaskan National W ildlife Refuge. They actually had the gall to atte mpt to drill in the Yellowstone. Meanwhile, SUV owners are lucky if they get seven mi les per gallon. The propaganda I heard on the news in July, 2001 was that it came up in Congress that SUVs \"are on ly getting 24 miles per gallon\", but \"should be getting 27 miles per gallon\", but \"manufacturers had refused to allow it.\" What a laug h. I wonder how much the SUV manufacturers had to pay for that lie. I have in my files a list of over 200 patents for vapor carburetors, granted between the 1920s and 1940. Many of these carburetors were available to the public until 1940, from such manufacturers as the Holly Carburetor Comp any. These companies still have them in their files, and probably still possess prototypes and production models of them . So why don't they start manufacturing them again and sell them to us? The Pogue carburetor was test ed in 1935. A V-8 Ford coupe, driven from Winnipeg, Manitoba to Vancouver, B.C. Canada, got 130 miles per gallon. The government grabbed the carburetor and put it on the Sh erman Tank, as WW II began. The tanks got 70 miles per gallon. Rommel' s Afrika Korps ran ou t of fuel. After the 8 th A.F. Ploesti (Romanian) oil refi nery raid, the Germans resorted to American \"acetylene chemistr y\" to produce ga soline fro m coal, but the Panzer Korps eventually ran out of fuel during the war. Hence, the Pogue carburetor became a \"national security secret\", denied to the public by extraordin ary \"national security\" policies. The pattern of using the government' s national security measures to unconstitutionally suppress the natu ral technological progress of our people has never been br oken, at least not yet.

Domestic oil production has be en suppressed since WW II in favor of the large—mo stly Rockefeller-own ed—international oil importers from sources in Sout h America, the Middle East, Indonesia, etc. The oil-importers were able to get our government to limit domestic U.S. oil produc tion, so they could buy cheap foreign oil and sell pe troleum products domestic ally at artificially high prices at the expe nse of independent do mestic producers, who were restricted to limited produc tion. In Texas, in the '60s, the \"five-day allowable\" meant that domestic indepe ndent producers could pump crude oil only five days per month. Meanwhile, the international oil impor ters—which also owned plenty of domestic mineral deposits—still had their fore ign oil coming in every day of every month without restrictions, so only the public, domestic independents and oil workers we re harmed by the illegal and unconstitutional denial of income. It is pertinent to note that, while we ordinary citizens are denied the fuel-saving carburetors , the oil compan ies ship their crude in giant, long, narrow tankers which expl oit a highly efficient nautical principle, using ships with proportionally long hulls to move the crude from foreign lo cations to the coastal American refineries of the Rockefeller companies with the greatest efficiency.

One of these devices was the catalytic converter. So what does a catalytic converter do? A catalytic converter contains \"activated carbon\"—impregn ated with a catalyst , such as \"platinum black\" (platinum oxide) or \"p alladium black\" (palladium oxide)—which converts hydro-carbon gases or liquids to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), on contact. Hydro-carbon ga ses and liquids are fuels, which can be used to run your engine. CO 2 is a fire extinguisher, especially for hydrocarbon fuel fires. If you put the hydrocarbons in the va por state, from your gas tank, into a carburetor vacuum intake, it will help to run your engine. If you put CO 2 into your carburetor vacuum intake, it will partially \"extinguish\" the combustion in your engine, and rob you of gas mileage. So why does the U.S. government require auto manufacturers to install mandator y catalytic converters on your car, which convert usable, raw hydro carbon vapor fuel from your gas tank, and CO (carbon monoxide) \"b low-by\" from your crankcase, into a \"fire extinguisher\", then put that fire extinguisher into your carburetor to interfere with the combustion in your engine, and rob you of gas mileage? And why did it require the manufacturers to do that in 1967? Because the oi l companies wanted it to. This book is about how powerfu l economic interests, which also control the government, the mass media and academic institutions, have used scientific thought-control to suppress free- energy technology. The UFO is only the most glaring and remarkable example.

We must rake government secrec y and misinformation aside, and take a closer look at the reality of that not -so-distant past of a century ago. The activity has alre ady begun, and exci ting times are ahead once more in th e field of science. Through the use of creative intu ition, logic a nd reason, a web of \"credential-ism\" is removed, to reveal a body of scientific orthodoxy, full of contradictions, mi srepresentations, false logic, and mysticism. As these are cut away , a soft underbelly of pseudo- science, which has been masquerading as absolute, immutable truth for almost a centu ry is exposed. We must re place this soft underbelly with \"abs of steel\". Speaking of the soft underbelly, contrary to what the public is led to believe, Relativism was in vented not by Albert Einstein, but by a Croatian Jesuit Priest named R. G. Boscovich (1711-87), the first exponent of Newtonian ideas in Italy, who attempted to account for all physical effects in terms of action at a distance between point particles. 1 The concept of the luminiferous ether was soon abandoned, in spite of Huygens' development of a brilliant wa ve hypothesis.

So the ether theory had been abandoned before in this earlier mid- 18 th century instance, in favor of a corpuscular theory of light. Ether theory was to be taken up again, then abandoned at the beginning of the 20 th century, for the same reasons... Relativism and the corpuscular theory of light. Back in the 18 th century, Boscov ich and his assi stant Michell had taught the doctrine of the mutual interpenetration of matter, i.e., that two substances may occupy th e same space at the same time, without excluding each other. 4 In 1782, George Louis LeSage 5 published a proposal to account for gravitation by means of the ethe r theory of Renee Descarte, that a cloud of excessively minute par ticles—\"ultra-mundane corpuscles\" as he called them—which resembled the neutrinos of modern atomic physics, filled all space. Accordin g to Le Sage, the ether moved with great speed in all directions. Wh en two particles or bodies of ponderable matter were near each other, they would partly screen each other from bombardment by this ether, so that less bombardment on their screened si des increased the force on their unscreened sides, pu shing them together, appearing to be an attractive force between them, which Le Sage identified as Newton's force of gravity. In 1889, Sir William Thomson 6 made the assu mption that material atoms move through space without displacing the ether, a concept which reflected the Boscovich theo ry. But by 1896 7 , he had redacted this theory in emba rrassment, when he realized how 3 Newton's Memoir, Phil.

Albert Einstein's wi fe, a Croatian scientist, was probably responsible for introduc ing Einstein to the Re lativism of Boscovich. This is probably the origin of rumo rs that Einstein had \"stolen\" the theory of Relativity from his wi fe. When Tesla was asked about Relativism, he disdainf ully exclaimed, \"I ha ve already heard about this from Boscovich.\" Tesla's well-known object ions to Relativism were probably formul ated while Einstein was still a boy. Boscovich and Michell had arrive d at their Relativist Theory by reflecting on Baxter's doctrine of \"the immaterialit y of the soul\", a religious doctrin e appropriate to a church, but not really essential to a scientific laboratory. If the Je suits had gained control of science more permanently, there would probably be prayer benches in physics labs today. They said 'an atom would have no definite size, but should be c onceived as extending thr oughout all space'; and 'a molecule would consist no t of atoms side by side ', but of 'spheres of power mutually penetrated, and the centres even coinciding.' 8 In 1846, Michael Faraday 9 appeared to brie fly fall under the influence of Relativism, proposing to 'dismiss the aether', or to replace it by lines of force between centres', with 'the centres and lines of force together constitut ing the particles of material substance'. By 1851 however 10 , the spell was broken, when Faraday began the modern era of theory which Relati vism opposes today. Faraday suggested that if the existe nce of a luminiferous aether were to be admitted, it might be the vehi cle of magnetic fo rce, adding, 'if there be an ether, it should have other uses than simply the conveyance of radiations'. This sent ence is regarded as the origin of the electromagnetic theory of light. The religious nature of Relativism has changed very little since 1763.

With all their money and infl uence, if they did scream, it wasn't loud enough for me to hear them, and I've been reading the papers almost every day. The problem with holding larg e tracts of land—something apparently learned by the Di amond A Cattle Company—is the requirement for private owners to pay taxes on that land. Enter the \"public trust\" huxters: A way to sucker the public, by bribing \"lawmakers\" to pass some \"private conservation\" laws—so that large, private land holders can enjoy their land tax- free, unlike the ordinary poor sl ob American—and even fool the dupes who work for them into th inking they are do-gooders, when in reality, they are dupi ng useful idiots into helping them pull off another publically-subsidized fraud. Whenever it becomes expedient for them to cash in on their massive land holdings, they will suddenly take off their \"sheep's clothing\", and show themselves to be \"wolves\" (no insult to the wolves intended). Anyone who says free-en ergy inventions will not work is either ignorant, a victim of government thought-control, or a liar with a vested interest to pr otect. Flying saucers/ UFOs—seen by millions of people since the '30s—are grap hic proof that they are wrong, and proof that some free-energy inve ntions work, and have been suppressed for over a century , as my research shows. I predict that those who have held onto the Relativist Theory for so long will be sorely disappoi nted in the near future by the triumph of free-energy solutions, which will discredit the theory along with the associ ated Second Law of Thermodynamics and entropy theory. These triumphs will be accomp anied by the re-discovery or liberation of free-energy secrets which have been concealed by the corporate-monopolist state for at least sixty year s.

The electrodynamic technology (not to be confused w ith something shown in traditional science texts under \"electrodynamics\") has the potential to reduce environmental problems to a minimum, if not to eliminate them entirely.

Whether he was actually employed by the spooks, or was unaware of their involvement, is immaterial to the fact that the publisher's interest in his redundant book was supported by the establishment. He calls his book \"UFO Disclosure s\" (not the real title), an oxymoronic title, since al l the \"FOs\" (\"flying objec ts\") he refers to ceased to be \"Ued\" (uni dentified) after they were declassified and published in Janes' Fighting Aircraft of World War Two, in the post- warl940s. So where's the \"UFOs\" or the \"Disclosures\"? A little late, wouldn't you say? Just as jet power is sometimes used today to conceal U.S. government UFOs, the jet and ro cket-propelled aerodynes of the Third Reich were used to conceal Tesla-conceived Nazi electrodynes, in a cycle of anachronistic du alism—archaic, jet-propelled, aerodynamic technology, used to c onceal older, mo re advanced electrodynamic technology. None of the aerodynamic technology has any relevance to true UF Os and represents an attempt to connect the remarkable performance of electr odynamic German UFOs to the \"conventional, aerodynamic, Germ an jet-propulsion\" of 1945. So, instead of call ing his book \"UFO Disclosures\", I have renamed it \"UFO Counter-Revo lution\", because it is counter- revolutionary propaganda designed to thwart the natural revolution which should result as the worl d realizes the concealed truth. The book is an example of propaganda created by American and British intelligence agencies to stem the tide of truth presently flooding into the public's awareness, as I attemp t to \"de-program\" the public's thought-control codes. As an older revolutionary, I see the Brit as a \"young fogey\", counter-revolutionary type that th e spook agencies were bound to manufacture as a \"last ditch\" de fense against my expose of illicit British-American UFO secrecy and fraud.

The Brit's job was to debunk all but the ae rodyne technology of the Third Reich (none of which was ever used), as a \"last-ditch\" defense which I predicted in my 1996 second edition of Space Aliens From the Pentagon. This approach sought to pe ddle the myth that all man-made UFOs are ae rodynamic advancements based on Nazi jet designs. This admits th e existence of UFOs, but says they are all aerodynes. Either the Brit never saw a UFO or he was lying, because once you've seen one perform, you'll never confuse it with a jet- powered craft. If he were that stupi d, he wouldn't have been able to write a book. Most UFOlogists appear nuts by proposing outlandish \"alien technology\", while the Brit appear s nuts by peddling archaic technology unrelated to UFOs. Instea d of promoting the \"alien\" party line, he imitates my ads, but suppor ts the conservativ e party line of conventional German aerodynamic jet technology that the oil companies love. If those experime ntal aerodynamic saucers actually worked, they would get much fewer miles per gallon than conventional jet aircraft, since they can't glide, and would also create more drag and friction at supersonic speeds due to increased surface area. This is a problem that el ectrodynamic UFOs don 't have, since the increased surface area helps the electr odynamics work better. The Brit poses as avant garde, propagating conservative, old ideas. Instead of studying electrodynamic technology, which allows a craft to dart and zi p quicker than a hummi ngbird, and exceed the equivalent of Mach 30 (\"equivalent \" because they are \"inertia-free\"), he extols huffing and blowing by jet engines, blasting the ships around like tired old buzzards with ragged wings.

Nonetheless, I overestimat ed the public's capacity to see through corny lies in the past, and shouldn't be surprised if many are duped by them in the future. P.T. Barnum really knew his people. The electrodyne technology wa s concealed by aerodyne technology, by the spooks, since they didn't want anyone tracing it to the discoveries of Nikola Tesla, whom they thought they had successfully buried forever, until I re surrected him. This suggests that those who obliterated Tesla's name and discoveries from the public consciousness in 1943 included the agents of Nazi Germany. I documented Tesla's unwitting connec tion to the Nazis in Pentagon Aliens, I was fraudulently induced to in clude some misinformation in my 1993 first edition of Space Aliens From the Pentagon, My 1996 second edition redacted it. The alleged \"ships \"—actually non-flying models of Felix Schauberger—were said to be electrodynamic, when in fact they were designed to us e aerodynamic princi ples, but never flew to my knowledge, and probably wouldn't have b een able to get off the ground. After discovering that the photos of the al leged \"ships \" actually depicted copper models of two of Schauberger's prospective designs, claimed to fly by means of internal fans intende d to suck air in the top and to blow it out the bottom, allegedl y powered by a Schauberger \"water vortex\" turbine, I felt the jackass ears growing on my head. Since the mode ls resembled air conditi oner vents, I dubbed them \"flying air conditioner vents\". I was enraged after being burned by this misinformation, but blamed myself for not exploring the allegations an d documentation more carefully.

I give him due cred it for his honesty. He said he made plenty of money fro m those books, so much that he doesn't care to sell any more. I vowed never to be duped like that again. There are basically three groups who propagate the alleged German aerodyne stories: (1) The Naziphiles, motivated by a desire to establish that the technology was a German \"Aryan\" discovery (but these Bubbas appare ntly have never seen a UFO in action, and are too \"untechnical\" to realize that electrodynamics is involved); (2) the CIA misinformationists, who us e the inept declassified aerodyne technology the same way the Nazi elite did, to conceal the real, electrodynamic Tesla technology; and (3) the dupes who believe that flying saucer te chnology in fact had an ex clusively German origin, unaware that \"real\" UFOs use exclusively elect rodynes invented by Tesla. (There are some who actua lly believe that the Schauberger \"flying air conditioner ve nt\" was a \"gift\" to th e Nazis from \"aliens\", tantamount to saying that the flus h toilet is a \"gift of the gods.\") A fourth group, which studies WW II-era Na zi UFO technology and secret weapons of the Third Reich, ha d realized that the aerodyne stuff was not th e correct story. This group went wherever the evidence led it, bringing th em to my work. I had firm documentation of things they had never hear d of. The group had all the best research available from \"conventional\" sour ces, and some from extraordinary sour ces, yet could not expl ain the electrodynes mentioned in reliable reports which originated in wartime Germany. After the war, the CIA controlled all information available from \"conventional\" sources, leaked out declassifi ed aerodyne technology for misinformational purposes, a nd successfully prevented the leakage of classified electrodyna mic technology. The information from unusual (non-CIA) sources—mo stly ex-Nazi Germans in South America—was misunderstood by them. My evidence on the electrodynes s howed they were older than the aerodynes, while existence of th e electrodynes isn't even admitted in conventional research. The Ge rman research group meanwhile unearthed documentation which corroborated some of my unusual -21-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"information, and published it in their papers. The symbiosis between this group and me soon attracted the attention of the spooks. My first edition of Space Aliens From the Pentagon was literally hacked out of raw paper and in ked by me, myself and I, as a \"samisdat\", while I was still in the horrible throes of judicial abuse, engineered by CIA mind-control ra ts. My nervous system was still in upheaval, with my swea t and blood splattered all over those books, with my anger boili ng over onto the pages. I'm not impressed by another redundant blow-by-blow account of the WW II aerodynam ic developments of the Third Reich, including jet-propulsion technology, used now as disinformation. It has no relevance except as misinformation. Does anyone seriously believe that the REAL electrodyna mic German flying disc technology would be published in Janes', at a time when they wouldn't even publish the statistic s of many propelle r-driven planes? I lost interest in th e aerodyne stuff in 1953 after witnessing the performance of a real, electrodynamic UFO, a nd realizing that the aerodyne technology was i rrelevant and obsolete even before it was invented and developed. The Nazi aerodyne projects were mostly smoke and mirrors, created as counterintel ligence buffers to c onceal the electrodyne technology. The CIA picked up where the Gestapo left off. Because of the inadequate explanations, Henry Stevens, of the German Research Project, Gorman, Californi a, had begun to \"look around the edges\" of those buffers, and found me. That opened up a whole new set of possibiliti es which were supposed to remain hidden.

In 1993, I disinterre d his most important work, the discovery of electrodyn amic space propulsion, which he discovered in the 19 th century, and documented it more fully in 1998. Does the name Nikola Tesla even ring a bell with you? If not, let me first say that Tesla was a pioneering inventor and technological philosopher whose sc ience and ideas we use today more than ever before, yet only recently has his name resurfaced in alternative literature. His name wa s once a household word, sixty or seventy years ago. Thirty years ago, only a tiny few faithful and persistent admirers and experime nters knew of Tesla's work, yet there are those within the inner sanc tums of the 'national insecurity' establishment who have never forgotten it. You've most likely heard the name being used in current alternative literature by the many johnny-come-latelys who have recently jump ed on the bandwagon of nouveau \"Tesla experts\". That's O.K., but what took them so long? You can't really blame them for being so suddenly astounded, considering the long and thorough er adication of Tesla's name from encyclopedias and books on scie nce, invention and technology, becoming the \"invisible ma n\" of science history. The conspicuous vacuum create d where the mention of Tesla should have been, as one who made such important contributions to science, technology, and the quality of our lives, raises ominous questions as to why his memory became virtually stricken from history almost the day after his death. What did Tesla discover which threatened the powers that be? Since we already know about the many patented inventions, my assumption has alwa ys been that the unknown, still classi fied works were far in advance of the published ones, and were in realization of pr ojects which Tesla had previously announced or had alrea dy tested and deve loped, but had not yet \"...given to the world\". 24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The discoveries in question—the very existence of which is categorically denied by establishm ent and corporate scientists—were such things as........ - electrodynamic flying saucers - \"free\" or \"environmen tal\" energy discoveries - transmutation of elements - alternative \"ether\" physics and science - Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity We know from available documen tation and reliable sources that these discoveries and devel opments were actualized by Tesla before his death, yet are still classified. W ithin his many patented inventions, numerous st artling discoveries and surprises have been recently found by careful research ers and experimenters, which show in retrospect that his claims were modest. Tesla was born in Smiljan, Lika , Austro-Hungary (now Serbia), in 1856, and died Jan. 3, 1943 in New York City, An early biography, Prodigal Geni us, the Life of Nikol a Tesla, by John J. O'Neill, was initially published th ree times in Nove mber, 1944. In case you are wondering, the three publishings in the same month were not due to landslide sales at the bookstores, but rather to O'Neill's having been threatened and censored by the FBI, and forced to republish several times because of their deletion and censoring of material which to this day is still classifi ed. It was odd, given Tesla's repeatedly unsuccessful efforts to get the attention of the War Department, met with ignor ance and shoddy treatment. It was not until after it came to thei r attention in 1942, that the Nazis were building flying saucers and other 'fantasy' weapons based on Tesla's inventions, that the U. S.

What better way to deter civilian scientific investigat ion into the obvious? I first heard of Tesla in 1943, as a child of four, when his death was lamented by Elme r Schlosser, a neighbo rhood adult friend who first told me about him. I also once had in my collection of old books a well-preserved, beautiful old commemorative volume issued by the 1893 Chicago World's Fair--- the Colutnbian Exposition— which featured Tesla as its honor ed guest. There were numerous photos of Tesla's inventions and some articles. Today, over 54 years after Tesla's death, experimenter s are still conduc ting exciting and trail-blazing experiments with Tesl a's discoveries of over 100 years ago, and continuing to find 'hidden' meanings in some of his early writings and patents. There have been countless speculat ions as to what Tesla's most secret discoveries were. At the ti me of his death, there was the approximate equivalent of a railroa d boxcar load of Tesla materials confiscated by the FBI, from around four different storage locations and Tesla's hotel storage and hotel ro om and safe. Of this, a total of only about 150,000 documents were released to Tesla's Yugoslavian relatives, now held by the Tesla Institute in Belgrade. These documents and old mode ls, primarily of a hi storical nature and already in the public domain, comp rise most of the published Tesla materials of the institute, and of the world. The rest of the huge volume of Tesla documents and models was retained from early 1943 to late 1945 by the Cust odian of Alien Properties, unclassified , in a warehouse in Ne w York City, because the government's \"experts \" had declared in 1943 that none of it was worth classifying. The governme nt \"expert\"—the equivalent of today's director of the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence—was a professor at M.I.T. In 1938, Tesla had written a critique of the huge Van de Graaff genera tor, and pointed out th at one of his small Tesla coils would outperform the huge Van de Graaff, which was so large that it was housed in an aircraft hang er. That critique and 26"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Tesla's opposition to Relativism pr ovoked the ire of the M.I.T. professor, a proponent of the \"new\" Relativism. For that infraction of the \"rules\", Tesla' s lifelong work was trea ted to the posthumous revenge of the MIT Relativist profes sor, by having his work stored in a dark warehouse un til the end of WW II. Following the arrival in America of the scientists and the secret war files of Nazi Germany, acquired in 1945 under Operation Paperclip, the spooks from Wright-P atterson Air Force Base hurried up to the warehouses of the Cu stodian of Alien Pr operties, and took possession of all the Tesla materials. They removed them to Wright- Patterson, and every bit of them have been cl assified at the highest level ever since; the government having since declassified NONE of them. Thus, the Tesla materials, which the government's Relativist \"science expert\" had declared in 1943 contained \"nothing worth classifying\", is still classi fied today, 58 years later. The government distributed false ru mors that \"Tesla never kept notes\", which was known to be a blatant lie, since the government had the tons of notes, papers, models and re lated things , and knew Tesla \"kept massive notes\". Th e notes on his Colorado Springs experiments alone (1899-1900) we re enough for a large-format book of 433 pages. Considering the fact that Tesla c ontinued to do research at his Colorado Springs laborat ory for at least six more years—for which we have no notes—there is ampl e cause for believing that those subsequent experiment s involved discoveries that are even more astounding than any nuclear wea pons research. It is known from Tesla's own words that these add itional experiments at Colorado Springs were 'much more far- reaching' than his disclosed experiments. The remainder of Tesla's papers and possessions which were still classified—literally tons of notes, documents, dr awings, models, and plans—have been the subject of a lot of speculation.

So I know that Tesla's papers are now held at least in part, in Los Alamos, New Mexico. On that same day, I found the hydrogen bomb plans on the public access shelves, yet wa s denied access to Tesla's papers. What could be mo re sensitive than the hydrogen bomb, which was invented by Tesla prior to 1943? After the war, in 1946, at age 8, when our family returned to the little west Texas town of Kermit, I visited the radio shop of my old friend, Elmer Schlosser, and l ugged home a pile of salvaged electronic components that he ga ve me, after a savvy little Tesla talk. That was the same year that I began to research the German flying discs seen over the region. Elmer, who had grown up in the Cimarron Territory, near Tesla's Colorado Spring s laboratory, during the time that Tesl a was experimenting th ere, said the discs were \"Tesla discoveries\". I assembled the components that Elmer gave me, ran a ground line up a tree, placed my newly assembled de vice in my tree house, erected an antenna constructe d of screen wire, and attempted to 'radio in' some power. Unsuccessful, I non etheless continued my experiments with electromagnetism for eight more ye ars, until I set them aside for tw enty years. In 1975 I resumed my \"Tesla project\", eventually built a number of Tesla co ils, and even began giving some lectures and demonstrations in the Santa Fe area to small gatherings. In late 1974, the CIA had comm enced a pattern of harassment originally intended to \"motivate\" me to accept an executive position later offered to me by George Bush in early 1975. I rejected the offer and immersed myself d eeply in intense resear ch, and the harassment continued and intensified so mu ch that it finally brought my research to a temporary standsti ll between 1986 a nd 1992. As soon as I had time to catch my breath, this provok ed the first publication of my book, Space Aliens From th e Pentagon, in 1993, Occult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propu lsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (revised second ed ition, 1998), concentrated on the 19th century \"aether\" science lead ing up to Tesla's discovery of electrodynamic space propulsion, a nd I also included a couple of 28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"astounding, Relativity-destroying \" free-energy\" discoveries or re- discoveries. Tesla's holy grail was to build his \"electric flying machine\", and to draw some of the \"environmental energy\" out of the cosmos- This plan involved a theory of radio activity under development by Tesla in the 1890s, which entirely presag ed and conflicted with currently accepted Relativism, quantum m echanics, and nuclear energy theories. To Tesla, so-called \"atomic ener gy\" was in fact the result of \"environmental energy\" emanati ng from the cosmos, and made known to us via \"radio active\" matter, which he said had the peculiar property of resonating and reac ting with ubiquitous \"cosmic radiation\"—a term used by Tesla before 1900—which he called \"Primary Solar Rays.\" The \"cosmic radiation\" of wh ich Tesla spoke was of much higher frequency than wh at we call \"radioactive emanations\", which to Tesla were the result of a 'ste p-down' process, in which certain peculiar matter reacts to and converts the ubiquitous, omnidirectional cosmic radiation—which today we call \"zero point radiation\" (\"ZPR\") —from higher fre quencies, to lower, more useful and appropriate frequencies, such as gamma, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared radiation, as we ll as magnetism and even electrical current. These step-down frequencie s are much easier to detect and measure than the ZPR. Relativis ts deny the Primary Solar Rays exist. The existence of the ZPR wa s well known to Tesla in the 1890s, but it was not until recently that it became scientifically permissible to even suggest a wave theory, since Rela tivists cling to their corpuscular theory . This radiation is of such high frequency that it normally passes through sp ace, the earth, and our bodies without harm or incident, in constant equilibrium, because its short wavelengths do not normally react or resonate with the atoms of most matter. It is so-called \"radioactive matter\"—according to Tesla—-which has a peculiar atomic structure which reacts with this radiation to produce radioactivity. Atomic energy, to Tesla, comes 29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"from the ZPR, not atoms. If a lump of radium, for example, could be shielded from the effect s of the ZPR, said Tesla, it would no longer show radioactivity. Most naturally radioactiv e elements are dense and \"unstable\"—that is, they are said by the Relativists to \"decay\" as radiation is emitted, to elemen ts of lower atomic numbers. The Relativists—with whom Tesla vehemently disagreed—believe that naturally radioactive elements spontaneously lose mass in the process of such \"decay\", so that th e energy released as radioactivity is equivalent to the lost mass acco rding to Einstein 's equation, E = MC 2 . This always seemed untenable to me, since such elements would have to have b een, by the related cosm ological myth of the \"Big Bang\", older than the earth, yet geological examination shows that they are found to have e volved through physical processes which have occurred within natural structures here on earth. If such elements had been part of the a lleged Big Bang, th ey would have fully decayed before now. On the ot her hand, if such elements are in the process of being continua lly evolved by natural conditions within earth, as well as in outer space, thr ough electrical, magnetic and other physical forces , the reasons for thei r presence is more reasonable. I don't think this is any surprise to the national security elite. Something else is going on, and someone else knows it. If non-radioactive elements are c onverted into ra dioactive ones by the forces of na ture, what are th ese processes? In 1937, in one of Tesla's famous birthday announcements 1 , Tesla stated that he had developed a process for the \"manufact ure\" of radium (transmutation from other elements), which was so e fficient that it could be sold for $1.00 per pound. He also announc ed that he had \"absolutely developed\" a system fo r the interstellar transm ission of energy. He said he had been working in \"sever al laboratories\", but refused to disclose their locations. His work ing model, he said, \"...employs more than three dozen of my inventions. It is a complex apparatus, 1 New York Times, July 11, 1937 (pg. 13, col. 2) 30"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"an agglomeration of pa rts.\" It could convey \"...several thousand units of horsepower to other plan ets, regardless of the distance\", traveling \"...through a channel of less than one-half of one-millionth of a centimeter.\" Furthe r, he said, \"...it is not an experiment. I have built, demonstrated and us ed it. Only a little tim e will pass before I can give it to the world.\" That time never came. In less than six year s, his death occurred in the presence of two FBI agents and a German nurse 2 , and the Nazis had his plans under active development as early as 1934. These facts demonstrat e that even in his 80s, in 1937, Tesla was involved in secret research at several undisclose d laboratories, on technology which today remains hi ghly classified, yet neither the general public nor anyone at the International Tesla Society seemed to have any idea as to the detail s, since they ha d been concealed from us by the \"powers that be\". In fact, the CIA itself had a hand in the founding of the Interna tional Tesla Society in Colorado Springs in 1986, to avoid the cont ingency of Tesla's electrodynamic discoveries coming to light. When this began to ha ppen, the society was folded up. Through some ingenious inves tigating, it is possible to reconstruct some of th e facts.

The ether, therefore, is a \"mediu m\" through which energetic transferences and transmutations can be effected, and electric and magnetic \"tubes of force\" can be created and carried into a body from space, giving it mo mentum to propel it. \"Cosmic radiation\" is not the ether, but \"starlight\"—what Tesla called the \"Primary Solar Rays\". 4 This extremely high- frequency light—of much tinier wavelength than visible light, U.V., X-rays, and gamma rays (also emitted by our sun and other stars)—is the ZPR. Tesl a stated that the Zero Point Radiation gives rise to secondary radi ations through impact wi th the cosmic dust of space, which are commonly called \"cosmic rays\" today. In 1935 5 Tesla objected to the obs ervations of the German radiologist, Dr. Werner Kolhoest er, saying his obs ervations were another confirmation of his own theory of cosm ic rays originally advanced inl896, but asserted th at Kolhoester's 1935 theory was erroneous, because light is a wave motion of definite velocity (C), determined by the elastic force an d density of the \"medium\", while cosmic rays are \"...particles w ith velocities determined by the propelling force... \", which therefore could be much slower or faster than that of light. Sinc e the velocities of th e two radiations would not (and could not) coincide, Ko lhoester's observations which coincided with the light observed, would not be accurate. Here, Tesla distinguished between the \"c osmic radiation\" he proposed in 1896, which was particles, which were propelled by ultra-high- frequency \"primary sola r radiation\", which I equate to the ZPR, which are light rays trav eling at C. Because of their extremely high voltages levels and frequencies, they can propel \"cosmic dust\" 3 T.C.

In his \"objection\" letter of 1935, at a time when he was involved with the Ge rman \"p2\" project which I wrote about in Pentagon Aliens, Tesla gave a clue to his electrodynamic space propulsion system, which if one is to take Tesla's statements seriously, means that a \"parti cle\"—or a ship—in space can be propelled very fast by electro magnetic wave ra diation—light waves—which in this case are the \"Primary Solar Rays\", the ZPR. The Primary Solar Rays (the ZPR) are ubiquitous in the universe and in direction of ap proach at a given point, with frequencies so high that there is normally no reacti on with atomic matter, being able to pass through \"...thousands of miles of solid matter...\" 6 , and therefore can approach an object on earth even from the direction of the ground. This ma kes this invisibl e \"solar energy source\" available around the clock, t hough it is said to slightly vary cyclically. This radiation should not be confused with so-called \"photon energy\", which is a Relativ ist fantasy involving \"corpuscles\" or \"particles\" of light. What a laugh. In the on-going Relativist theo ry, Wolfgang Pauli, in 1933, invented the neutrino theory, in response to Niels Bohr's radical finding that, if experiments say so, the Law of Conservation of Energy does not hold for (\"beta\" or electron) emission and absorption processes. 7 Pauli's theory sought to explain a loss of heat energy in beta decay, which the Relativist theory was unable to account for or measure in such processes as K-capture, in which a neutrino is emitted when a proton is converted into a neutron. The reverse process is the conversion of a neutron into a proton, thus emitting a beta particle (electron) and sucking a neutrino back into the atom from surroundi ng space.

It is also interesting to note that Bohr attended the opening of the Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Wit hout Bohr's work , the A-bomb would have been impo ssible at that time. The acquisition of energy from the ZPR was rega rded by Tesla as a \"step-down\" proces s, in which the supe r-high-frequency light waves were stepped down to a more familiar and usable form, such as 'normal' radioactivity, heat or electrical energy. In the K-capture process, an element is transmut ed into another element, for example, iron to manga nese—and in the reverse process—manganese to iron. Monoe nergetic neutri nos are ejected in the first process, and sucked back into the iron in the reverse process, but what happ ens to the damned X-ra diation emitted in the first half of the reversible pr ocess, Einstein? And how is it mysteriously \"replaced\" in the reversed half? The neutrino explanati on has always appear ed as a loophole in the Relativist theory, since the missing momentum and heat, and misconceived \"photon en ergy\" (actually electro magnetic light wave radiation), were impossible to expl ain without the invented neutrino theory. Furthermore, since the neutri no is a neutral particle, it is composed of tiny positive and ne gative charges which do not exist according to Relativism, since Relativism holds that the electron is \"indivisible\", as the main foundati on of quantum mechanics. With this argument, I now have some of my Relativist friends denying the existence of neutrinos. In contradicting their own th eory, admitting that the tinier positive and negative charges composing the neutrinos exist, the Relativists inadvertently acknowle dged the \"building blocks\" of electrons and protons. As such, ne utrinos appear to be the aether. Since neutrinos are so tiny, they must have the capacity to react with the ZPR, in bringing about so -called \"nuclear ra dioactivity\". In so doing, what are the nuclear char acteristics of an element which produces radioactivity naturall y? How can a non-radioactive element be made to mimic these qualities, in artificially-induced 34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"radioactivity\"? If neutrinos are prevalent in K-capture (transmutation), and its reversal, it seems that an element which is made to oscillate be tween two elements (to transmute and de- transmute), would have to react wi th the ZPR. Sinc e there is excess energy involved, as the neutrinos (ether carrie rs) move in and out, energy is being transferred to a nd from the element, the ZPR, and the ether. We know that synthetic radioactivity can be induced by exposing an element to appropriat e radiation, which is only a reversal of the process which initia lly created the radiation, as a verification of Tesla's theory. In K-capture in iron, when the K-shell electron passes into the nucleus, converting a proton in to a neutron, not only is a monoenergetic neutrino emitted, but also an X-ray, when the vacant K-shell takes on another electron. Though the iron atom is now a manganese atom, and has emitted energy, it has the same mass number. Shouldn't the mass number reflect the loss of energy? Where is your damned \"E = MC 2 ?\" There is al so the question, \"Where did the incident particle beam energy which induced the K- capture go? If the neutri nos taketh away, they also giveth back, as \"carriers\". Of course, one can say th at the electrons involved do not weigh enough to be reflected in the mass number. The Relativists admit (or assert) that the neutrinos carry energy, just as the aether carriers do. Recent Japanese experi ments showed that neutrinos are plentiful in space. The greatest s ource of free-energy appears to be the ZPR. If the number of neutrons in a disintegration produ ct (the atom transmuted to) is too small compar ed to its number of protons, the nucleus will tend to reduce its charge by one unit by positron emission, and will always have 1 Me v less kinetic energy than if beta decay had occurred. 8 Since a light element (below atomic number 19) will transmute in U.

I got the idea for this device from a statement by Nikola Tesla, concerning \"special\" uses for iron, to capture the ZPR/Primary Solar Rays. Whether or not this is exactly what Tesla meant, I believe it verifies his statement concer ning special properties of iron. The device, composed of steel pipe and bar stock (about 10 lbs.), is stimulated with a 15 kv, center-tapped transformer. It operates in several modes, but in what I call the \"hum\" mode shows an input of 35 watts and a secondary activity of 42.6 kw, operating at or beyond the approximate K- capture voltage on each leg, ca. 7,110 volts (the K-capture voltage for iron), at the standard 60 cps. The low frequency current goes into the mass of the iron (not a 'skin effect'). The iron seems to be going to manganese and back to iron, 60 times per second. This idea is based on what appear ed to be the appearance of a purple area near the top of the pipe which I recognized to be the color of mang anese dioxide.

The voltage is not really critical, as the effect could oc cur so long as the voltage passed through the K-capt ure voltage on its way up and down, and is only supposed to cause a somewh at more definite eff ect when it is right on the \"absorption edge\". It appears that the electrical energy in the secondary output circuit can be converted into usable electrical energy, especially by using a resonant transformer, t uned to the same, 60 cps frequency. Corporate-government disinforma tionists have already tried to debunk this device. One \"debun ker\" inadvertently revealed the fact that he didn't actually do th e experiment, when he described the device when assembled as wei ghing \"two pounds\". No reputable \"scientist\" could confuse \"ten po unds\" with \"two pounds\", so I knew he was lying. Naturally, hi s assessment was negative. He was either a lightweight, who didn't do th e experiment as described, or a liar with a concealed agenda. This discovery may prove to be a new way to produce K-capture, and to tr ansmute elements in a reversible process, by stimulation with simple , standard 60cps electric current, at or near the K-capt ure voltage, or at some other appropriate voltage, without the necessity to use an incident particle beam accelerator, vacuum chamber, etc. A good free-energy process, therefore, can use an element—conveniently a light elem ent—as a \"mediu m\" to induce another \"medium\"—the ether, or a nother element—to interact with and acquire energy from the ZPR, which is then stepped down to either a synthetic radioactive out put—which can be further stepped down to manageable electrical en ergy or heat—or perhaps converted more directly to electrical energy by some ingenious means. The attempted destruction and concealment of Tesla's work has now been exposed, and will soon be reversed. The factions which were responsible for this stil l exist through perpetuity, but will not be able to control the te chnology when it finally emerges. 37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III - CONCEALED ENERGY: The Second Lie of Thermodynamics The Second Law of Thermody namics states that any spontaneous process occurring in th e universe leads to an overall increase in the entropy of the uni verse.

ZPR is ubiquitous electrodyna mic wave force carried by the ether. Because of its ultra high fre quency, it is extr emely penetrating and forceful once arrested, and can operate on ultra-fine levels in minuscule atomic and molecular reactions. We must first reject the con cept espoused by the relativists, that matter is \"destroy ed\" in the process of being used to do work (producing energy). Matter produces force, and while this force is \"used\" to do work, and though the force may become dissipated over a large area, this process doe s not represent th e 'annihilation' of any matter, or of force produced by it, as assert ed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics and relate d entropy theory. As force is used, new force is continually enteri ng into a reacti on, replenishing force dissipated by the reaction—and is still conserved in the form of momentum, IR storage, or ra diant energy in ether-filled space. This brings us to the question of the 'origin' of new force, in a ubiquitous form available to all matter being replenished by it, allowing it to react again. This is the conservation of matter and force, what I call th e \"Theory of the Conservation of Perpetual Motion and Force\". The replenishment of expended fo rce in a region of space is apparently the result of an exchange of forc es, weak for strong or vice-versa. A weak forc e can be converted in to a stronger force, which will do more work in the same period of time. Whenever a weaker force, such as kinetic for ce (gravitational) is converted into, or exchanged for, a stronger force, such as an electromagnetic one, the force is 10 40 times stronger. 3 Since this for ce is so much stronger, it will do more work in th e same period of time, in fact, zillions and zillions of times more work. Where does th is increase in force originate? The source of this \"new\" ubiquitous force is of course the ZPR, which makes the energy density in a small region of space so high that I won't even bother to say. 3 Gamow, Gravity 40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"This processes repeated throughout the universe, automatically replenishing areas of sp ace in which the force has been dissipated through a lower order of reactio n, because there is a tendency toward equilibriation. The sun send s out electromagnetic radiation, electric current and magnetism. The sun also receives ZPR, electric current and magnetism from elsewher e, which replenishes the force expelled, maintaining its e quilibrium in perpetuity. A good example of this circuitous process is wh en atmospheric oxygen combines with carbon and hy drogen in coal combustion, breaking HC bonds and producing CO 2 and H 2 O, with a release of IR radiation, in a sustained com bustion-reaction. This is possible because the HC bonds are weaker than the CO and HO bonds, so the stronger bonds are formed. This is a replacement of 'looser', weaker (electrostat ic) bond/force, with a 'tighter' stronger (electrostatic) bond/force, releasing heat (IR radiation entrapped in the O, H and C, which is 'squeezed out' when the new, 'tighter' bonds are formed). The CO 2 is then available for plants, which absorb the C and free the O in phot osynthesis, driven also by solar radiation and the ZPR. The oxyge n is then available again for combustion-reactions and the carbon becomes part of plant HC compounds, eventu ally becoming coal beds again. The H 2 O is also utilized in photosynthesis, rel easing more oxygen. Repeat, ad infinitum. The bonds appear to be electrost atic ones. The 'breaking' of electrostatic bonds should not acc ount for the heat released, as a conversion product of electrostatic fo rce. The heat is IR radiation which has been 'stored' in the atomic space between the nuclei and electron clouds, as bounc ing and reflecting radiation, until the electron clouds are 'ope ned' during ne w bond formatio ns. When the new bonds are stronger, the reaction is exothermic (heat-releasing), and when weaker, they are endothermic (heat -absorbing), because the stored IR radiatio n apparently st retches the bonds and weakens them. 41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\"THE UNIVERSE IS WINDING DOWN\" (To the tune of \"London Br idge is Falling Down\") One of the most pronounced tr ends since the accelerated 'media-advent' of Relativism (around 1919), has been an emphasis on instilling the false id ea in physics that th e universe is \"winding down\", progressively \"using up\" the energy it possessed at its \"beginning\". In 1916 Einstein had devised a static mode l of the universe, having uniform density but with sp ace allegedly \"c urved\" by the presence of matter, so that it had a fi nite volume. In order to justify this steady-state universe, so that gravitation did not collapse it, Einstein invented a repulsive fo rce between masses, to equally balance the \"gravi tational attraction\" . How convenient. In 1917 de Sitter purportedly \"found\" a further solution to Einstein's equation, an expanding universe concept (now called the Big Bang Theory), which would ha ve a \"vanishing density\" due to the constant expansion. Einstein's career, and the income of the oil companies, really took off. This he lp from de Sitter was 'really what the doctor ordered' for Einstein's theory and the oil companies. The purported discovery of the \"r ed-shift\" of the galaxies was used to further the expanding universe concep t. The time elapsed since the \"beginning of the expansi on\" is taken as the age of the universe, and is considered to be the reciprocal of Hubble's Constant 4 —about 10 10 years—but the theory was flawed by the fact that the astrophysically-determined ag e of the oldest star clusters in our galaxy is about 16 x 10 9 years, about twice Hubble's Constant.

The same thing applies to othe r planets in space. The \"red shift\" observed in light passing near bodies in space, as the alleged basis for an \"expanding\" universe, is apparently due to a refraction of the light by this rigidified ether, a phenomenon which does not require the presence of an atmos phere. It is simi lar to Faraday's \"magneto-optical eff ect\". This shoots down the Big Bang Theory. The Michelson-Morley experime nts were based on an ether which was dynamic in relation to the earth. They tried to detect a \"drift\" in the ether as the earth moved through space. Since the ether near the earth is rigidified an d carried along with it, there is no relative motion to detect, no 'drift '. But the ether is relatively dynamic farther away from th e earth. This means that the Michelson-Morley experiments, based on a \"dynamic ether\" concept, and conducted on the surface of the earth, could not possibly have detected an \"ether drift\", because the ether is not 'drifting' on the earth's surface, where they did the experiments. Meanwhile, the ether near the planets and bodies in space which showed the \"red shift\" is not only rigidified by the \"microwaves\" emitted from those bodies, and subject to \"magneto- optical effects\", but the bodies are also in rela tive motion in respect to the light passing near them, thr ough their rigidified ether. These facts were ignored by the Relativists, naturally. In 1892 6 , Tesla demonstrated be fore the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London, how a column of gas was rigidified by a rapidly alternating current. He also told them how, prior to that, his tests had shown that th e space between two metal plates subjected to currents of \"sufficien tly high voltages and frequencies\" had become \"solid state\" (i.e., would support the plates, which 6 Nikola Tesla, Experiments with Alternate Cu rrents of High Potential and High Frequency (a lecture delivered to the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, 1892) 43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"weighed several pounds each). 7 This was the basis for his electro dynamic space propulsion di scovery.

While the infinity of past and fu ture are commendable (after all, there will only be a pr esent, forever), the idea that a galaxy \"needs\" to have an age equal to Hubble time is teleologicaL These are truly infantile no tions, which are used by the Relativists to talk us out of appr ehending energy av ailable from the environment.

Energy is never destroyed, and is conserved in the constant motion of matter and radiation in space-tra nsit, representing infinite, available energy forever.

Without really explaini ng themselves, the Big Bangers have told us that matter gets neutralized, and can't do any more work, forever, through a mystical \"entropy\" principl e. This is base d on the fallacy that matter contains en ergy in the first place. Matter in motion has momentum (kinetic, me chanical energy), and can react in electric and magnetic fields to produce elect romagnetic energy , but does not \"contain\" energy. It may also st ore heat energy, as previously explained, but this en ergy—electromagnetic he at radiation—is not an integral part of matter, a nd nothing is \"lost\" by its release. Energy is not an entity, but onl y a potential, the \"ability to do work\", which cannot 'disappear fore ver', since it exists only as a quality possessed by matt er to store or affe ct the conversion of electromagnetic force, under certain circumstances, not something which exists in a quan titative form within matter itself.

According to the Relativists, in order for energy to become \"unavailable\" (i.e., \"used up\" forever), it is commonly believed that, in its 'last, final work', the \"process\" through which it reacted, somehow became \"irreversible\". No w let me see....what would such an \"irreversible process\" be? Is it the \"process\" which is irreversible, or is it the \"state of matter\" which is? I rack my brain, but fail to find an answer. I do no t know of one single irre versible process! I think what these 'scienti sts' really mean, is th at the availability is hard to follow, or a process is ha rd to reverse, or that they are unable to think of a convenient way to reverse it, or that they fail to understand the actual proce ss, or that they fail to realize that matter is not destroyed or irreparably damaged by being used to produce energy, and may actuall y improve with use. If a process is reversible to begi n with, it should always remain reversible, and it appears to me that matter is not irreversibly changed by an energy process of any known kind, so what the Relativists appear to be trying to say, is that a different process—an 'irreversible' one— whenever it is substituted for a 'reversible' process, will fail to produce ener gy. To my knowledge however they have failed to identify an irreve rsible process. Th eir inability to identify such a process is a critical part of their theory. If all the atoms in the original process still exist, the Relativ ists have been lying to us. Certain processes have been id entified as \"reversible\" ones.

If there is such a th ing as an irreversible process, and a person wants to ge nerate energy using th e same matter, over and over, he shoul d make certain to avoid a non-reversible, dirty, cartel-desired process, and use a clean reversible process, which captures the ZPR and produces no waste.

A simple example of a reversible process which uses the same matter to produce energy over and over would be a hydrolysis process which produces a stoichiometric oxygen-hydrogen mixture derived from water, which is combus ted and used to drive a turbine, after which the water vapor is c ondensed to water again, and is reused in the production of the st oichiometric gas mixture, over and over, ad infinitum. There are seve ral ways to sepa rate the oxygen and hydrogen which use less ener gy than that produced by the combustion-reaction. This is reasona ble, considering the fact that the external energy whic h actually drives the process is the ZPR. The reaction is triggere d by hydrolysis, to 'set up' the water in a state-change, for the ZPR reaction. The process can be enhanced by use of certai n catalysts, metals and geometric a rrangements, which take advantage of the best use of physical forces. Contrary to the idea that energy continually becomes unavailable, there is some validity to the idea that matter being used in a reversible process to pr oduce energy may ac tually become \"conditioned\" and improve with repeated use. 47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Advent of the \"SMS\" Henceforth, I will refer to what I call the \"Standard Model Scientist\" in singular, abbrevia ted archetypal form—\"SMS\". Since SMS is an archetype, composed of all Standard Mo del Scientists, who are apparently of like mind, possessing a sort of \"collective consciousness\" due to government thought-control, w ith a peculiar kind of scientific tunne l vision, all such scie ntists are faithfully embodied in my SMS. SMS sees \"isolated systems\" within the universe, when convenient, which are unaffected by external forces or matter, yet considers the universe as a whole an \"isolated system\", whenever that is convenient. Is olated from what? If th e universe were finite, what would there be to isolate it from? This is contradiction on the grandest scale: Isolated systems w ithin an isolated universe which is finite. This is another negative pr egnant which has become a begged question through the continual, unquestioned acceptance by SMS. The only thing apparently isolated (from reality), is the brain of SMS. Looming very large in the mind of SMS is the Second Law of Thermodynamics—sometimes refe rred to as the \"Law of Degradation of Energy\", because of the entrained theory that \"entropy\", in an \"isolated system \", is increased by \"irreversible processes\" involving energy changes, and that, therefore, the sum of total \"available energy\" \"within\" the universe, tends to decrease. Hmmm...now let's see...decreasing energy in the universe...equals increasing prices at the gas pump...equals more money and power for the greedy monopolists who guarantee jobs for compliant scientists. The way that SMS couc hes \"entropy\" (a negation) in such terms as \"increasing\", is a negative pregnant, or maybe a better term is \"pregnant negation\". \"Doublespeak\" 9 has certainly been enshrined in the science field. 9 George Orwell, 1984 (1949) 48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"There are at least eight things in particular with which I disagree, as false assu mptions and begged questi ons, in this \"negative pregnant belief system\": 1.

It should be noted that SMS has boxed in \"a vailable energy\" with negative pregnants and begge d questions, to eradicate it, but the pregnant affirm ations are still there. I be lieve that 1. through 8. above are all false assumptions. Without a doubt, they are all negative pregnants, there being no such thing as being \"half' pregnant\".

Isolated Systems and Irreve rsible Processes Forever? SMS's special mathematical trea tment considers all quantities ascribed to \"isolated systems\" to be aspects of a single, physical magnitude, and concludes that \"...any physical sy stem when left to itself always increases its entr opy, and therefore decreases its 'available' energy.\" But what system is really \"left to itself forever? A coal bed? What? SMS says the universe is an \"isolated system.\" By applying this statement to the universe as a whole, as if it were an \"isolated system\", SM S naturally concludes from this completely unnatural presupposition that all energy processes in the universe are \"irreversible\".

Is this really tr ue, or might it be the result of looking at everything from an artificially negative viewpoint (because the corporate-st ate pays your salary)? 50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"It can be easily se en from these presupposi tions that in order for us to be convinced th at energy is in short supply in the universe, we must be taught to believe that (1) the universe is finite (i.e., isolated), and (2) that matter with in the isolated universe is getting all tuckered out. In the case of absolute ze ro, SMS had a problem, since everything at absolute zero (excep t electrons, supposedly) is frozen in place, so it cannot \"d egenerate\". In response to this apparent flaw in theory, an SMS named Nernst ca me to the rescue with his \"heat theorem\", which stated that all phys ical and chemical changes in a system at absolute zero take place at \"constant entr opy\", so there is no \"change in entropy\" ( called \"isentropy\"). He said this is also true of adiabatic processes, since they are \"rever sible processes\". The problem with Nernst's theorem is that most adiabatic processes are reversed by external energy. This leads to another gross contradiction, which confirms th e existence of ubiquitous ZPR (perish the thought that, in s uperconductivity, the magnetic field produced external to the superc onductive ring, for example, is considered as \"available energy\", an other apparent flaw in Nernst's theorem). If any energy reaction can be obtained externally to a so- called isolated system, maintained at absolute zero, with no change in \"entropy\", then Ne rnst's theorem is wrong, and the ZPR is affirmed. Otherwise, what could su stain such a reaction? After all, superconductivity does not destroy th e magnetic field. If the current is alternating, the magnetic field is also, and even a steady magnetic field contains ener gy and will do work on moving charges. It is apparent that the very large and very small aspects of the Second Law of Thermodynamics are in terdependent, so that, if the very small aspects are untrue, then the very large as pects must also be untrue. If the universe is not an \"isolated system\"....because no \"system\" is completely isolated from universal pr ocesses...then the \"law\" must be untrue. The burden of proof here is not on the person who assumes that the univ erse is infinite, since it apparently is, but rather on the person who believes it is finite, since it apparently isn't.

Science can not be based on such speculation, especially where it is part of a \"grand theory\" used to conceal available energy not at the limits of the unive rse, but in our own immediate space. In reality, there appears to be no \"isolated system\" which is immune from external effects. This is especially true where we have penetrating cosmic rays, X-rays, UV, visible radiation, radio waves, IR, neutrinos, ether, magnetism a nd a ubiquitous form of radiation produced by stars which interpenetra tes everything. This is also true of neutrinos, whose penetrating pow er is measured in light years through lead. Neutrinos are reab sorbed by mass which is undergoing K-capture process reversal, so neut rinos from perhaps the other side of the universe may a ffect the production and availability of energy within any so-called isolated sy stem. Of course, SMS might argue that, since the K-capture process is a reversible one, it is not an isolated system. But there are no truly isolated systems, the argument being based on a fals e premise, since the K-capture process refutes it by showing th e emission and absorption of neutrinos across vast regions of space and through other mass. ZPR may play a part in every single matter change, etheric, atomic or molecular. In view of this, it is di fficult to imagine that any isolated system exists, except in the collective mind of SMS. It is difficult to imagine why SMS inter poses such fictitious archetypal concepts as \"isolated systems\", in s upport of archet ypal, collective delusions, other than hi s desire to keep his job as a physics prof. Tesla's theory of radioactivity is controversial only because it has been suppressed, in favor of th e Relativistic theories of SMS, yet it is more reasonable than that of SMS, as applying to all energy changes in the universe. All en ergy changes—except those at absolute zero, or involving reversible process—are considered \"irreversible\", and resu lt in \"degradation of energy\" according to SMS. Is there really such a thing as an irreversible process? SMS would argue that, \"...sur e, you might reverse an irreversible process, 52"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"but that would take energy from an external source.\" This gives cause for wonder how a process whic h is irreversible forever could be reversed by anything at all. Si nce there is nothing in the universe which is really isolated , there is always available energy to reverse any process anywhere. ZPR energy originally converted within a system has never really disappeare d, but still exists somewhere, within the system or exte rnal to it. After all, this energy is not really a thing, but rather a pr operty of matter under the circumstances, no matter how slight, capable of transf orming radiant fo rce to another form. In reversing an 'irreversible' process with 'external energy', energy 'dissipated' by ot her processes can be c onceived as being used to 'pay back' what was previously dissipated by a so-called irreversible process. If the sum total of all universal energy (force/matter/time) remain s the same, it can neve r degrade. It is all just a matter of time. SM S confuses states of matter with energy. It is true that, due to a matter's state, it can react with the ZPR, or can be diminished in its ability to do so, but these states are all reversible. Disappearing Mass? In a nuclear reaction, such as that in which a quantity of \"unstable\" radium \"spontaneously \" emits powerful radiation into surrounding space and matt er, SMS would say that the radiation is the product of \"radioactive decay \" as expressed by Einstein's equation, \"E = MC 2 \". According to this equation, the emission of a certain amount (\"quanta\") of radi ation, at certain voltages (say 4.5 Mev), over a certain time period, is equal to a certain portion of the mass of the radium, multiplied times the speed of light, squared. The equation says that th e mass of the radium decreases by an amount equal to the \"interco nverted\" radiant energy emitted, based on the assumption that matter and radiation are interchangeable. Since the uncontested 'minim um' age of the universe, according to SMS—notwit hstanding the astro nomically-determined ages of the oldest stars clusters in our galaxy—exceeds the purported 53"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"atomic half-lives of a ny radioactive materials, it is confirmed that such materials were created w ithin the earth through natural process, and that othe rwise the atomic half- lives would long since have expired. In 1936, Nikola Te sla produced radium through transmutation, quickly, in pound quantities, with a process which he said was so cheap th at it could be profitab ly sold for less than a dollar per pound. 10 As it emits its radiation and alpha particles (stripped helium atoms which have mass), the ra dium's mass does not shrink. Any gaseous emission—radon gas—mainta ins its mass, atom for atom, proton and neutron for proton and neutron, electron for electron, etc., all mass remaini ng constant and accounted for. Any so-called \"decay product\"—such as lead—has th e same mass as the original radium, less any radon atoms or alpha pa rticles emitted. The physical components mere ly become juxtaposed , and none of them \"become\" electromagnetic radiation. Where, then, has the energy come from? Tesla said it comes fr om the ZPR.

Radium is apparently \"stepping down\" the ZPR to gamma and X-radiation frequencies, just as Tesla said. Without a shrinking mass of radium, it has to be true, especially at the particular rates and levels of emission. The sun shines through my wi ndow and heats up a flagstone floor. The heat moves from the stone to the earth below and the air above. It 'dissipates', warming the air. The warm air rises to the ceiling, forcing colder air downward, 'doing work'. SMS considers this energy \"unavailable\", because it eventually dissipates, but the reality is, whether or not ener gy is available does not depend upon whether SMS can follow it, but on wh ether we have good reason to believe it will not be unavailable forever, or that matter is not irreparably damaged by use in an energy proc ess. Even though the particular matter may not immediately bend to our will, due to the state that it is in or the place that it resides, it does not 'disappear', and may be processed for use again, or will become included with other matter, where it undergoes na tural changes which eventually render it available for later re action, whenever that may be. If the combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel such as gasoline yields CO 2 and H 2 O, with the release of usef ul heat force converted from the ZPR by the expansion of hot gases which run an engine, how can this matter be made to react ag ain? If the process to reverse the process is too complicated to put in our cars, we should use other processes which are not so complicated. I put gasoline into my tank, start my engine, and the gas and air mixture combusts in the cylinders to produce torque to drive my wheels. The exhaust emissions—CO, CO 2 H 2 O vapor and heat—are only a rearrang ement of the same fuel and air molecules which entered the engine. Once in the atmosphere, the chemical and heat units are sorted and con centrated or dissipated by nature. Some of the units are recombined by plants into the raw material for more gasoline refinement, and the cycle can be repeated, ad infinitum.

All motion is perpetua l, all energy is conserved, and all energy is free for the taking.

SMS works for the banking, mine ral or power and industrial cartels, or is a dupe, or maybe even all the above. A real scientist should know better, know the truth. Energy is not a \"thing\", and ther e is no such thing as \"pure energy\" in any physical form. Energy is force, created by matter in motion, exerted on othe r matter over time. Mass is moved by force, and gathers and exerts force thr ough movement and reaction with the ZPR and other radiant force. Th e magnitude of a particular force and the length of time it is exerte d on other matter determines the amount of work done. When force is exerted to pr oduce heat, the IR radiation is the result of conversio n from another type of radiation, such as magnetism, visible light or ZPR. An example is a campfire, in which carbonaceous matter (wood ) is oxidized by fire. The chemical disposition within th e matter and air maintains the reaction. The heat radiated does not represent destruction of the atoms of carbon or oxygen, but ra ther the conversion of radiant energy by the atoms wh en oxidation occurs, at which time the bonds between the atoms as they existed before are broken, and are replaced by new bonds with other elements. This causes a molecular change in which the atoms release stored IR radia tion, or the ZPR reacts with the atoms and molecule s, \"stepping down\" the ZPR, like a transformer, to IR ra diation. There is also a possible release of stored IR radiation in the hydr ocarbon fuel atoms and molecules. \"Combusted\" carbon is bonded to oxyg en as CO 2 . \"Combusted\" hydrogen is bonded to oxygen as H 2 O, usually in a vapor state because of the liber ated heat energy.

Th e energy in the coal deposits being formed is not 'unava ilable' forever, but remains ever capable of combusting or eventu ally transmuting ZPR into IR radiation, again and again. SMS has no answer as to where the heat energy of combustion comes from, other than to say that it is a \"release of the bonding energy\" of the molecu les. But if the bond ing energy of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon, prior to the reaction, were weak enough to allow the reaction, then the 'tighter' bonds producing the CO 2 and H 2 O in the reaction, represents an overall absorption of energy, with the result that the re action should produce a c ooling rather than a heating effect. It seems that th e force produced by the combustion reaction—IR radiation—may come from a source external to the reaction, and could represents \"fre e energy\". The only change which has occurred in the matter is its ab ility to combust, which has been temporarily neutralized. SMS would have us believe that the \"fuel\"—oxygen, carbon and hydrogen—have decrea sed in available ener gy forever, but it simply isn't true, and the peopl e who ultimately controlled and designed his academic curriculum knew it. Though it is not comf orting to realize that all the gasoline and diesel fuel combusted in engines is still represented in the natural environment, it is a fact that the exhaust products are forever available for use again.

Intuition tells us that hot water appears to \"store\" heat, but the fact is, heat transfe rred to water enters it in the form of IR radiation, and when the heat is extr acted from the wate r, it will also be as IR radiation, in a reversib le process, even when in direct surface contact with a heat conduc tor, in which case the atoms or molecules of the conductor beco me excited by contact with the 57"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"water, as the conductor transfers th e stored IR radiation. Since the IR radiation excites the water, th is may allow it to react with the ZPR, until the same fini te amount of heat is ra diated back out, in a reverse reaction to that which occurred when the IR radiation entered the water. When hot wate r is carefully insulated in something like a thermos bottle, with a mirrored inner surface, the combination of heat-reflection, vacuum and insulation virtually isolates it from contact with an ex ternal heat conducting material (though not the entire universe). The IR radiation remains in the water, and virtually doe s not exit until the insulator is removed. Otherwise, it could 'jump' the insu lator like microwaves can. The insulator does not stop the ZPR, bu t inhibits its reaction with the water, since the lower end of th e 'step-down' process cannot be continued so long as the water retains maximum heat in a liquid state. There is no energy inherent in matter, only the inherent property possessed by ma tter to store radian t energy and to react when undergoing molecular and atom ic state-changes, to react to radiant energy force, and to conver t it to useful force to perform work, such as heating, lighting, communicating, and mechanical force. It is not matter alone which determines the availability of energy, but rather the st ates, and changes of st ates of matter, which give it the capacity to react to the universal ZPR and other matter. Lvne's Hypothesis As I said in 1993 12 —based on my \"Omni Theory\" of 1963—the only way the earth coul d have grown like it has, is through solar/ZPR-driven photosynt hesis, through which ether has been assembled into the solid mass of most of the elements found in the earth's outer layers. Around 1961, I personally cut the samples of oil well drilling 12 William R. Lyne, Space Aliens From the Pentagon (1993, rev. 2nd ed., 1996); Occult.

The samples represented cuttings from all the strata from the surface down to ca. 22,000 feet, I believe (if my memory serves me), all the strata contained the detritus of li ving things, essent ially dependent on photosynthesis, either animal life remains, pl ant life remains, or minerals derived from these, through meta morphosis or natural transmutation. The universe must have a 'constant' of life-forms. According to my theory, the elem ents we have at our disposal are mostly the products of photos ynthesis and metamorphosis over time, derived from the action of radi ation on the ethe r, via plant and animal life, except for a small perc entage of \"space dust\" (formed the same way on other ce lestial bodies or in sp ace) which fell into earth's atmosphere. Since the elements we know of are found in deposits in the earth's upper layers, I assu med they were produced by photosynthesis or metamor phosis/transmutation from photosynthetic products, driven by the ZPR and other solar radiation, and that these deposits continue to the ear th's center. The idea that earth has a \"m olten iron core\" is a s illy one, since the laws of thermodynamics would require th at the surface would melt too. Having seen their pet Relativist theories shaken by my obvious facts, an article appeared in the Orlando Sentinel, carried also by the Santa Fe New Mexican on 7/30/01 , under the headline, \"NASA probe on mission to catch some ra ys.\" The article stated that a NASA solar probe called Genesis was scheduled to bl ast off on the 30 th , on a mission to \"catch some ra ys\"—to collect some samples of our sun's solar wind, and bring \"t hem\" home to scientists, thus allegedly marking the fi rst time that \"extrate rrestrial material\" has been returned from beyond the moon. Though this incidentally confirms my theory of at least some of our minerals, etc., by admitting that the el ements on earth were \"assembled\" here (since they are not consider ed \"extraterrestrial materials\") the truth of the matter is, there is a lot of 59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"\"extraterrestrial material\" dropping into earth's atmosphere every day.

The mission concentrates on cosm ic \"particles\", which are not electromagnetic radiation, but co mposed of atoms propelled by solar radiation, as Tesla said in the 1890s . It also misses a real concern, the ether which is asse mbled into earthly ma ss under the influence of solar electromagnetic wave s, especially of the ZPR. The $164 million spacecraft is in tended to \"shed light on the makeup and evolution of our solar sy stem.\" It is hypothesized that the solar wind—a stream of char ged atoms—contains the \"same mix\" of elements found in the sun's surface laye rs, which in turn is believed to mirror the contents of the sun's solar nebula. Two and a half years of sampling is expected to collect material weighing \"no more than several grains of sa lt\", and \"should\" contain \"every element found naturally in the sola r system\".

Eventually, animal life forms developed in a similar way. Certain other basic elements transmuted to others under the influence of cosmic radiation, and some additional elements were assemble d from ether particles into atoms of different elements, until the elem ents were complete. The entire series could have be gun with the simplest atoms, hydrogen, gathered from space.

Thomson also declared that \"...t he aether is a storehouse of mechanical momentum\", based on \"his\" theory, concluding that \"...the aether is itself the vehicle of mechanical momentum, of amount (1/4*pi C [D . B] per unit volume.\" As stated by Sir Edmund Whittaker 17 , in a steady (electrost atic or magnetostatic) field, the resultant stresses acting on a volume of the aether is zero, so that the aether is in equilibrium. But when the electric and/or magnetic field is variable, the re sultant stress on the aether is consistent with Tesl a's earlier, 1891 findi ng, and Thomson's 1893 equation as stated above. Tesla's experiment had verified this, using \"alternate currents of high voltage and high frequenc y\", on the assumption that a changing field wa s essential to creation of the necessary stress upon the \"medium\" (the ether). What is more important, until Tesla's demonstration, using generators he brought along, the British had no idea of how to create the necessary high fr equency fields. This, of course, was the basis for Tesla's electrodynamic space propulsion system. 16 J. J.

The formation of what one believes is usually limited by one's epistemology—what one's \"first la ws\" are, what one's theory of knowledge or truth is. Is \"seeing be lieving\", or is \"seeing just an illusion\"? Philosophers have iden tified two basic theories of epistemology, which are the Platonic and the Ar istotelian. We each usually choose one or th e other, depending on what we are willing to accept as \"the truth\" or accept as \"real\". The Platonic epistemology, ba sed on subjective \"first-laws\" (\"irreducible primaries\", the beginn ing point for any philosophy), in this case states that there is a 'h igher world of perfect forms', which we can never really see or kno w directly. According to this epistemology, the world around us is only an illusory \"shadow\" of these higher, perfect fo rms. Accordingly, we cannot have a direct knowledge of reality, because we can't depend on our senses as a reliable means of knowing reality. The Platonic epistemology's name is derived from Plato's Cave Analogy, which is about a person sitting at ni ght in a cave, between a fire and a passing cara van. As the caravan pa sses in front of the fire—which lights an inner wall of the cave, and cast s a shadow of the caravan on the wall— the viewer sees no more than a 'shadow of reality' (the shadow of the caravan). The cara van itself represents reality—the world of 'p erfect forms'—which we are unable to see directly. This epistemology is usually typi cal of religious people, and of Relativists, the people who have be en running 'official' physics since 1919, maybe longer, I could never figure out what was stopping the 64"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"man in the cave from leaving th e cave and taking a look at the caravan directly. The Aristotelian epistemology has objective first-laws, which state as an irreducible primary th at the senses are valid tools of cognition (thought). What you see or sense, can be accepted as true on its face, because visi bility, in the three- dimensional space of perceived, physical reality , is based on scientific ally measurable light, shadow, distance, height, weight , color, etc. The Aristotelian epistemology interposes no mystical, spiritual or religious concepts between the observer and reality , through which our knowledge must be filtered, such as Relati vism seems to require. While non- visible or non-perceptible forces a nd factors are recognized, if they can be measured as heat, light, s ound, touch, or smell, or through the use of scientific instru ments—which are technological extensions of our senses—these forc es and factors are not \"relative\". As Ayn Rand said, \"The facts of reality are what they are irrespective as to whether we are aware of them or not.\" 1 , and \"Existence exists : A equals A.\" The disconnection of scie nce from the Aristotelian epistemology, and the movement of scientific t hought toward the Platonist epistemology, was accelerated part icularly after 1919, when Relativism was projected into the vogue. Beginning about 1910, the mega-corporate owners of the mass media had begun to control science and other educational curricula, 2 particularly that of the medical schools, through the us e of so-called \"philanthropic grants\", which were actually desi gned to benefit the corporations which had set up the foundations through which th e grants were awarded. These Rockefeller grants set the stage for the controllers. The foundations eventually appointed compliant faculty members as officers, so that the foundations, corporations, and the 1 Ayn Rand, Philosophy: Who Needs It? 2 G. Edward Griffin, World Without Cancer, Part II, The Politics of Cancer Therapy, American Media (1974) 65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"educational institutions were thoroughly invaginated with one another. This process, which be gan with grants favoring medical schools which taught a curriculum which advocated the use of products manufactured by the pharm aceutical subsidiaries of the Rockefeller family, soon also in cluded the slanting of physics curricula toward Relativism, appare ntly intended to more directly favor the Rockefeller petrol eum industry upon which the pharmaceutical industries were based. This use of the educational gr ant process completed the basic cycle of how the corporate giants began to control what scientific professionals were allowed to think and believe. Those who bucked the system just simply wouldn't be allowed to remain as part of it. In 1905 Albert Einstein re-i ntroduced the world to the religious, 18 th century Theory of Relativity . The media giants wasted no time in promoting this 'wrong tu rn' of physics, and by 1919, it was in full swing. Some of the be liefs advocated by Relativism border on insanity. The things some adults believe remind me of a little child who closes his eyes and thinks he is no longer visible. We play along with the gag and say, \"Wha t happened to Bobby? He disappeared! How did he do that!\" But when adult scientists do it, it is no joke. It is hard for me to accept the fact that some a dults believe in \"other dimensions\", but why s hould I be surpri sed, since the concept of \"heaven\" is one of anot her dimension, the existence of which people have been taught to believe for thousa nds of years. Heaven can be neither perceived nor ascertained objectively, and whether it exists or not depends upon the fa ith of the believer, rather than reason. To me, if you can prove something exists in this dimension-—the only dime nsion I recognize—it is IN this dimension, because I think there is only one dimension, called \"reality.\" The fact that people have priv ate thoughts, dreams, and ideas in their minds does no t verify the existence of \"other\" dimensions, since we know that mental processe s are held in th e mind, in \"our\" dimension, as electrom agnetic patterns, waves, currents, fields and data configurations, similar to ho w a computer stores information, 66"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"except the mind's computer is a dynamic electromagnetic and organic one, rather than an exclusively inorganic, dynamic electromagnetic a nd mechanical one. Though some beliefs border on insanity, I don't think there is a correlation between insanity and belief, but there appears to be a correlation between indu ced neurosis and belief. An insane person, or a person with a ne urological disorder, who sees, hears and feels things and beings which aren't th ere, does not do so because of his epistemology. He does so because his mind plays tricks on him, due to organic malfunctions in his ne rvous system and biochemistry, which cause visual, auditory and ot her sensory halluc inations real enough for him to believe. He doe s not say he \"believes\" these things, since he usually has no choice. In a way, such an hallucinating person, by accepting what he \"sees \" as \"real\", has an Aristotelian epistemology, except we know that he only \"sees\" the hallucinations in his mi nd. To whatever degree he recognizes them for what they are, he ma y still be a rational person. The concept that insanity is a disease was rejected by the director of the New York State Hosp ital, Thomas Szasz, as stated in his book, \"The Myth of Mental Disease\". Sz asz destroyed the idea that an insane person was one w ho had \"caught\" a \"disease\" which could be \"cured\" through psychotherapy. 3 According to Szasz, \"The classification of (mis)behavior as illness provides an ideological justification for state-sponsored social control as medical treatment\". 4 In other words, if you mindle ssly accept the misclassification by the state or the psychiatric profession, of a mental problem having a physiological, biochemical or neurological basis, as a \"disease\" or \"illness \", you may soon find yourse lf being treated to the \"therapy of choice\" of your local cops. 3 Thomas Szasz, The Myth of Mental Disease (1960) 4 Thomas Szasz, Manifesto (summary statement) (1998) 67"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"It had already been discovered about the time th at Szasz wrote his book, that schizoph renia was not the resu lt of a series of \"traumas\" which \"split the persona lity\", but rather of organic malfunctions in the patient's brai n physiology and biochemistry. The cure might be pharmaceutical, but no amount of \"mental hygiene\" or \"therapy\" would cure it. Unbe lievably futile effort has been expended on \"psychoanaly sis\" and therapy, a la Freud, Meninger, Jung, etc., without curing a single, true schizophrenic. While true, organic insanity —psychosis, which totally obstructs rationality—has little to do with epistemology, neurosis—which interferes with ra tionality, but does not totally obstruct it—is yet another thing which can be induced by an epistemology which encourages beliefs which interfere with rationality. The kind of episte mology pushed by the government's covert propagandists is the Plat onist epistemology, which induces neurosis in many people, but worse than that, it is an essential part of the government's program of controlling the way many people think. If we consider the general publi c as inmates in a gigantic mental asylum, the government's thought-control program is worse than mere quack psychotherapy, because the \"psychotherapy\" is intended to induce, rather than to a lleviate neurosis. In this case, the \"doctor\" is fraudulently generati ng more \"business\" through abuse of his patients, by inducing them to believe things which will maintain, create or increas e neurotic \"dependency\". Since one's credulity, regulated by one's epistemology, limits what he or she finds believable, cr edulity is a sort of governor, which allows information and ideas into the mind, or excludes them, either as \"credible\" or \"incredible\", s ubject to certain tests which one requires of them. Ordinarily, fo r one with an Aristotelian epistemology, these 'tests ' are in the form of ra tional questions, such as: 68"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"1. Can the information be objectivel y verified by my senses or detected scientifically? 2. Have I personally seen, heard, touched, smelled, measured or otherwise sensed it? 3. Is the information or id ea from a reliable source? 4. Can the information be documented by rational people? 5. Does the information seem to violate any natural law? 6. Does the information seem to violate any scie ntific law? 7. Can I trust those who say it is valid? All these credulity tests are su bject to modification whenever a person has a Platonist epistemology, since Platonists don't believe in relying upon objectiv e evidence, and don't believe we can 'know' reality, a belief which is supposed to give them a \"King's X\" (immunity) from reality or account ability. Therefore, in order to render the public at large more ea sily susceptible to government thought control, the Platonist ep istemology is na turally the one which the government trains its covert propaganda agents to promote, particularly through paranormali sm and spiritualism. This technique came straight fro m Nazi Germany, and is what I call the Big Lie False Propa ganda System, developed in conjunction with John D. Rockefe ller's plan to co ntrol the world through religion, and taught to the SS by his psychologists and psychiatrists in the 1920s. In this system, a big hole is first wallowed in the public's credulity, with Big Paranormal Lies spread by people the public has been taught to re spect—such as those with Ph.D.s and other authoritarian titles—so the public will accept whatever other Big Lies the government wants it to believe. As stated by Adolf Hitler: 69"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"\"In the size of the lie there is always contained a certain factor of credibility, sinc e the great masses of people ...will more easily fall victim to a great lie than to a small one, since they themselv es...lie sometimes in little things...Thus such an idea of an untruth will not at all enter their heads...therefore, ju st for this re ason some part of the most impudent lie will remain and stick.\" This statement revealed the ma ss-psychology sy stem which was used on the German pe ople to gain their s upport for events which defied the scientific reasoning for which Germans were known worldwide. Government thought-control won't wo rk if there are plenty of reliable, respectable, rational, genuinely independent people available in society, with access to the media, to id entify and point out the devious government-corpor ate scheming to the public. For that reason, to avoid this conti ngency, corporate-controlled media excludes such people, while the government's \"official\" public propaganda is directed partly to the general public, and partly to society's so-called \"intelligentsia\". Government Thought-Control of Scientists a nd Professionals This is a two-pronged, \"divid e-and-conquer\" st rategy carried out through two teams of covert pr opaganda agents, which I call the \"Pseudo-Skeptics\" and the \"Pse udo-Paranormalists\". The Pseudo- Skeptics pose as members and leader s of the intelligentsia, while the Pseudo-Paranormalists pose as memb ers and leaders of the public's grass-roots \"alternative\" commun ity. The message of the Pseudo- Skeptics also coinci des with the government 's \"official, public\" position on science, while the message of the Pseudo'Paranormalists is intended to represent irrationa lity, mixed with things like the worst kind of religious supersti tion and paranoia—to make the government's position seem more rational by comparison—and things the government wishes to discourage though ridicule heaped 70"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"upon them by the Dupe-Intelligentsia (unwitt ing or useful educated idiots).

In this way the Big Lie System achieves the aims of the Dictator ship without bloodshed or overt oppression. It uses \"t rick psychology\" on the people to carry out political, social and ec onomic programs as pa rt of its undisclosed agenda of control and econom ic and physical exploitation. Neither the Pseudo-Skep tics nor the Pseudo -Paranormalists are genuine representatives of true public opinion, but represent a \"government-designed\" set of opin ions intended to intermesh, to subvert public opinion and rule by consent of the governed, from top to bottom and side to side, and to obliterate the most rational assumptions in the \"arena of reas on\". What results is a \"rule by consensus\", a form of fascism. 5 In order to insure that \"for bidden\" knowledge remains secret, the system of government though t-control manufactures a false government \"skepticism\" among dupe d scientists a nd intellectuals, to maintain this secrecy rega rding free-energy and Tesla's electro dynamic space propulsion te chnology, as I have already mentioned.

Thought-c ontrol is a kind of \"thought fraud\", a means of controlling one 's opinions and beliefs through a combination of truth-concea lment and false propaganda (information control), and intimi dation (a kind of psychological terrorism). These are used to create the false appearance of \"conscious\" acceptance by the victim of a cert ain set of opinions regarding certain subjec t matter, as if the vi ctim had consciously accepted those views, when in fact he has been defrauded by denial of information which has been re placed by misinformation, making it impossible for him to ma ke a fully-informed decision. As an example of this t hought-control among supposedly \"rational\" people today, whom I call \"Dupe-Skeptics\", there is a specific topic of conversation, a bout which independe nt, individual opinions are abolished, and only a certain, pr e-ordained opinion is tolerated or considered to be \"rational\" by the government, as expressed by its of ficial Pseudo-Skeptics, who must know the truth in order to conceal it, or pretend not to be lieve it. The government has the official policy of prohibi ting any professiona l people who are respected for their positions in the community, from expressing opinions contrary to the government's dictum on this issue (just as it does on several other particular issues). On this particular topic, who or what power is it which \"pre- ordains\" or \"allows\" only the \"tolerated\" opinions, and \"why\"? What kind of intim idation inhibits supposedly rational, professionally educated people, creating their fear of the free discussion of a certain topic, induci ng them to 'consciously' yield to the preferred opinion of the contro lling authority, and to limit their own expressions—and even freedom of thought?

This sy stem of inducing people to limit and control their own thoughts and expressions to conform to government parameters was copi ed from religion, and shows successful thought-control. It, lik e religion, employs guilt-based thought-control methods. The segment of our society from which educated Dupe- Skeptics usually come is genera lly one which is more easily intimidated than that of say, au to mechanics or heavy equipment operators, who are usually more resistant to such pressures. In fact, they may slap you up-side of the head with a tire-iron, if you try that on them. Dupe-Skeptics, under govern ment persuasion, in deference to an external, covert governmen t-connected contro lling power and media-created consensus, have banned this opinion from rational consideration, and have categorically relegated it to the realm of the lunatic fringe, even tho ugh the forbidden opinion is the most rational alternative under the circumstances. Such a situation makes a mock ery of the very concept of rational skepticism. What we are presented with as \"skeptical opinion\", in those magazines on the book stands—such as The Skeptic, The Skeptical Inquirer, or Skeptical Opinion—is more like covert government propaganda th an anything remotely resembling true skepticism in the historical tr adition, when it comes to the so- called \"forbidden topic\" of UFOs. Why would true skeptics be afraid of a truly rational consideration of the fact s, reject the most ra tional alternative, and cave in to pressure from the government, the cult of in telligence, or some other group, regarding any topic? They wouldn't. What the government's reign of thought-te rror has done, is reduce the ranks of true skeptics to a small few, who have little or noth ing to do with groups or their magazine s.

There is no question but that the Dupe-Skeptics have allowed their fear of the govern ment to control their opinions, thoughts, and expressions on this topic. For ex ample, of the many Unitarians I questioned on this topic (Unitari ans pride themselves on having \"independent opinions\" and \"free thought\"), every single one of them, without exception, considered Philip Kla ss to be a wonderful speaker, who reflected their opinions regardin g the non-existence of UFOs. Not a single one of them was bothered by the fact that Klass is a CIA man with a j ob to do on their minds.

The importance of the topic I speak about can be gauged by the degree to which, in comparison to the topics I just listed, the government places the utmost emphas is on maintaining secrecy, far beyond its efforts on any other topic, even nuclear weapon and missile secrets. This fear, silence, and syc ophantic compliance proves that there is an unspoken, covert go vernment rule, which prohibits a truly rational and free discussion on this topic, which is subject to the greatest priority, much like scientists were once persecuted by the church-state, which openly prohibited as heresy the free discussion of even the possibility that the scie ntific facts about the universe differed from those specified in holy writ.

These assignments were determined by the specialities of the scientists, the availabl e facilities at the time at various nearby locations, and the particular roles assigned to the bases. Generally speaking, Sandia Base is an Army weapons de velopment center. Ft. Bliss was the U.S. Army Ordinanc e center, before being moved to Redstone Arsenal in 1951.

Today, after having seen so much of the propaganda, I know that I can depend on the government writers to conti nue to practice the same false reasoning used all along since 1947, guided by 79"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"government security parameters. This is perfectly logical, maintaining substantially the same original format and propaganda tricks used in the Ro swell hoax. The govern ment has apparently decided to make \"Roswell\" a perennial thi ng, to be played upon by their covert propaganda teams and front writers, since so much of their later false propaganda de pends upon that original hoax. In 1960 I worked alongside Jesse Marc el for two weeks—the same \"Major\" Jesse Marcel—who inadvertently became a main character in the origin al Roswell Hoax. The r eason I believe that Marcel was not a \"witting\" participant in the ho ax, is because, from my experiences with Marcel, I believe he was an honest man who really wasn't the kind to fool th e public intentionally, and wouldn't have been very successful at it anyway. It's possible that they subsequently forced him to rema in silent—which was required by his clearance anyway—to conceal ce rtain facts, but his clearance didn't require him to remain silent on things learned through \"innocent means\", from non-government source s. I only know what Marcel told me. Marcel was a fine man, intelligent, dignified, and it was a pleasure to talk and work with him. Marcel was a company representative for Mary Carter Paint Company, out of New Or leans, and I managed a Mary Carter store in Midland, Texas. Hi s job was to come and work with me for two weeks, to see what I had accomplished with the paint mixing and matching system whic h I was employed to help the company develop. I was an expert in that area, because I ha d learned to use the Munsell Color System while a student at the Columbus College of Art and Design in Co lumbus, Ohio in 1957-60. I also had several years experience in our family paint and decorating business between the ages of ei ght and fifteen, in Ke rmit, Texas, between 1947 and 1952. At that time we had the most modern paint and interior decorating company between Phoenix, Dallas and Albuquerque. We had clients from as far away as Silver City and Albuquerque New Mexico, and Abilene and El Paso Texas. It was because of my experience in the paint business, and expertise in mixing and matching colors, that I was hired to work in 80"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"the paint store, to te ach the owner of the store and to develop a coherent set of mixing and matching formulas, to be utilized by the rather new paint corpora tion in its many stores. Years before, just before the Roswell Hoax, so me military people from the Alamogordo-White Sands area had come down to Kermit, wanting to know about green paint, and how to apply it just to create a \"greenish tint\". I showed them how to rub dry, powdered green tempera paint on a surface to create a green tint, and sold them some of our gr een \"Prang\" dry temp era pigment. Soon afterward, when the wo rd got out in the Roswell Hoax —possibly by rumor or by news story—that \"little green aliens\" we re found in the \"crashed alien space ship\", I immediately susp ected that the technique which I had shown those men had be en used in the hoax to create the \"little gr een aliens\". At that point, without photos, I figured they could have used midge ts or dummies, possibly monkeys, dressed up in space suits. Regular paint wouldn't have been as convincing, since it wa s not flexible enough. I was not aware that I was working with the same Jesse Marcel who had unwittingly played a part in the Roswell Hoax of 1947. The reason I was unaware of that, was b ecause I hadn't paid that much attention to something I knew to be a hoax. The reas on I say Marcel \"unwittingly\" played a part, is because I th ink Marcel was pulled into the hoax unawares. In our discussions while worki ng, in between customers, and during meals at Midland restaurants, Marcel to ld me about his Air Force training as a bomber pilot, at the Midland Air Park during WW II, as part of a \"second team\" of the 509 th Bomb Group, being trained to drop A-bombs. He said they took the bi g bombers through Immelmann turns, in order to drop the bombs more safely, since in ordinary bombing, the bomb would detonate along a line directly beneath the plane, exposing the pl ane and crew to blast radiation and shock waves. The Immelmann turn avoided th is, by having the plane going in the opposite directi on from the bomb. A bo mber would be taken in a half'loop, releasing the bom b at the quarter-loop point, which 81"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"threw the bomb outw ard due to the centr ifugal force and momentum. The bomb continued upward, away from the plane, until it reached its apex, then continued to arch over into vertical descent, sort of like tossing a so ftball underhanded in a high arch. Meanwhile, while the bomb arched toward its apex, the plane was arching back in the oppos ite direction to its apex , in inverted flight, at the 'half-loop' position. This ga ve the plane some time to distance itself from the descending bomb, as it proceeded to its final destination. The plane wa s then rolled over carefully to place it into regular flight in the opposite di rection to that from which it had arrived. The bomb meanwhile c ontinued on downward, and by the time it reached its detonation altit ude of about 10,000 feet (the bombs were air-bursts), the plane was far enough from the blast to withstand it, and to protect the crew from its radiation. The subject of Roswell—a nd the hoax—arose in our conversations, because that was wher e Marcel said he was stationed after the war, so that brought up the subject. After I told Marcel what my sister's mother-in-law ha d told me about her sister—the Army Air Corps nurse at Roswel l, who later became a nun—who was present during the so-called \"a utopsy\" (actually a dissection, performed on a rhesus monkey), he c onfided in me that he agreed that the whole thing was a hoax, designed to cover up the German UFOs which the both of us knew were being flown by the government and military in the regi on after the war. I had told Marcel about my post-wa r high-altitude sighting s of squadrons, and the close-up 1953 sighti ng over our back yard. Being an aircraft nut myself , and formerly in Air Force Intelligence like Marcel, we had some interesting conversations. Marcel was a very nice guy, orig inally of Cajun descent from Louisiana, just as my uncle was. He had th e same tight wavy hair that my uncle's Louisi ana relatives had, which can be seen on the ancient sculptures of Akkadians of Mesopotamia, c. 2300 BCE. This is because the Cajuns desce nded from the ancient Akkadians. After I left the Mary Carter Pa int Company, in the summer of 1960,1 was the artist-in-residence of the Midland Art Association, 82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"and lived in the old Air Force bu ildings at the Midland Air Park, where I also did some painting a nd drawing, and ta ught classes for the Art Association. The floors were still decorated w ith the original blue and yellow tile, which showed the in signia of the Air Force bomb group, and most of the inner structure of the old air base was still intact. It was eerie to imagin e what had transpired there in the closing days of WW II, only 15 years before. Jesse Marcel was not a deceptive person, who would have been skillful at creating or carrying out a hoax. Originally trained as a bomber pilot in the atomic bomb pr ogram, his later training as an intelligence officer was oriented toward maintaining the usual nuclear bomb and Air Force delivery systems secrets at Roswell. He seemed to have no awareness of, capacity for or training in the intricacies of false propaganda or spooky activities. After all, he was a pilot. It was not until the summer of 1993 that I published my first UFO book, Space Aliens From the Pe ntagon, 244 pages, 8\" x 11\". There was practically no activity in the UFO field at that time, but my book—100 hand -bound copies—hadbarely seen the light of day, when the OSI began an accelerated and massive counterintelligence campaign. The volume of new ma terial buried my little book. The shelves at the books tores, which had pr eviously displayed only a handful of UFO/ alien books, were soon fi lled to capacity, crowding my books off th e shelves and making them as invisible as a needle in a haystack. It was di fficult enough to distribute them, because the CIA keeps such a ti ght handle on what the large distributors catalogue in that field. It exerts considerable leverage on large publishers and book dealers, since the government buys so many books for the thousa nds of libraries and bookstores at military bases and other domesti c and overseas installa tions of the U.S. government. In 1996 I published a revised a nd expanded, 252- page second edition, with small-ty pe, and in 1999 publ ished a final, small-type, 306-page third edition, re-named Pentagon Aliens, in 8\" x 10\" format. In 1997 I had published Occu lt Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden 83"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It, followed in 1998 with a second revised edition. Each of these books is densely packed with material, since, as a self-publisher, I had to compress my material to get more 'bang for the buck'. Since 1993, almost every single UFO/alien publi cation I have read has contained prop aganda and arguments directed specifically against issues I raised for the first time in my books, without mentioning who had ra ised the issues they sought to counteract. Since I was the one raisin g those issues, it was cl ear to me that they were responses to my books. No more than a couple of these writers even mentioned my name or the names of my books. I have also heard direct quotes on prime-time TV from others who apparently read my books, such as Robin Williams, who repeated my joke concerning a \"... flea farting in a tornado\", from Space Aliens From the Pentagon, verbatim, on the David Letterman Show, around 1999. I was fl attered that he did so. Many of my ideas have been pe rverted and used in several movies and TV shows, such as The X-Files, One of the first influences I noticed was in the movie Terminal Velocity, starring Charlie Sheen, There was a \"Sam's Surplus City\" in the movie, where the owner had a rocket sled . This was a combination of my cartoon, \"Sam's Saucer City\", \"Kin g's Surplus City\" in Albuquerque (where I purchased my Peiltochterkompass), and the rocket sled I mentioned at Holloman, to which the rhesus monk eys in G-suits were strapped. The \"terminal ve locity\" was the 120 mph velocity which 1 alluded to as the ve locity of \"weightlessness\". Since 1993, never ha ve so many governme nt propagandists argued so much or so vigorously to counteract the words of a writer who almost none of them ever mentioned, but were apparently aware of and were responding to. This follows the policy which I have identified, that the governm ent propagandists are never to mention another writer on the subj ect, unless he is a CIA asset, because they want results to be predictable and controlled by them, and don't want to draw attention to \"non-assets\". The alien putsch was multiplie d and magnified several times 84"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"over in the past eight ye ars, but with very lit tle new added to what had already been said, except for the arguments designed to specifically counteract my books , arguments and evidence. My books have been the source of not only much plagia rized material for the counterintelligence Ph.D. pa rasites—who, as I said in my first edition, lacked originality or creativity—but al so a source of dozens of new themes which I introduced, which have been appropriated and reworked as false propaganda in th e alien putsch, in films, books and articles, without attr ibution, by generally uncreative writers. This devious fo rm of plagiarism is a lowly sponging of ideas. The reason so many of these government propagandists have gotten their ideas from my books is because they we re required to read them, because they lack cr eativity, and because many of my ideas are appropriate for complete books, so many can be or have been written on my ideas. I could have wr itten many more books myse lf on each of my themes, but could only afford to publish one book at a time. As I slowly began to chisel away at the monolithi c publicity and book distribution field so well-guarded by the CI A, to get my books distributed, I usually had to go through underground channels. Meanwhile, the CIA's unlimited resources a llowed it to finance many writers and the publishing of many books, ofte n derived from my themes, to counteract what I wa s saying, as if to teach me an \"object lesson\". In one case—the movie Roswe ll—a character in the movie appears to impersonate me, ma king my \"monkey al iens\" argument to Martin Sheen and others. The name given to the character was similar to mine, and the whole port rayal was as uncomplimentary as possible, as if a childish retort to me without mention. This was the result of my psychol ogical warfare work ing on their minds. In 1995 I wrote an article, No Aliens, Just Assholes, for Paranoia magazine.

One of the few writers to menti on me, Phil Patton, hardly got anything right about me personally, either because he is a sloppy researcher, or by intent . He said he got a c opy of my second edition in North Carolina. In his book Drea mland, apparently influenced throughout by my book—par ticularly in his \"mov ie reviews\" and in imitation of my comparisons be tween Pentagon and professional Hollywood special effects—he got very little righ t about my book. But by copying my techniqu e of comparing Pentagon and Hollywood special effects, Patton inadvertently supported my 1993 thesis that the government USES su ch special effect s in its alien hoaxes. In his chapter 21, \"Space Al iens from (sic) the Pentagon and Other Conspiracies\", he made the followin g misrepresentations: 1. That I said the saucers were \"fak ed by the Pentagon\" (I said the aliens were faked by the Pentagon , but that the sa ucers are real, man-made electric flying machines); 2. That I said the Pentagon's purpos e in creating the saucers was to \"frighten the public in to the arms of the NWO\" (I said the Pentagon's purpose in mystifying the saucers as \"alien ships\" was to conceal the technology from the public, and to wallow a hole in the public's credulity with paranor malism, so that it would accept whatever Big Lies the governme nt wants us to believe); 3. That I was alone when I saw H itler in San Antonio in 1967 (I had a credible fellow witness, wh o recognized him simultaneously); 4. That I \"..argued with R. Sargent Shriver over my dismissal from the Peace Corps\" (a lie; I had a friendly talk with Shriver, which was BEFORE I was dismissed fr om Peace Corps training); 5. That I received an MFA from Sa m Houston State U. (my MFA 86 "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"was from U.T., Austin , just as it states on my book jacket); 6. That I said the National Se curity Act of 1947 was treasonous because it \"...divided the services\". (Anothe r lie: I said it was treasonous because it was never passe d into law, wa s a presidential edict, and that it violated Amer ican sovereignty and liberty by denying our right to fully-inf ormed consent or refusal.); 7. That I had \"seen phot os of dead m onkeys\", but \"the y were stolen by a former girlfriend\" (another lie: I possess ed a photo of dead rhesus monkeys in G-suits , and a photo of a fake 'saucer' used in the Roswell Hoax, until the photos were stolen by a wo man I didn't even know until later. Patton's other statements about me and my book, taken out of context in most cases, though somewhat accura te, demonstrated an obvious intent to ridicule me , the man he got ideas from and plagiarized, a tendency I have no ticed among several others of his ilk. As often said, however, \"Imita tion is the sincerest form of flattery.\" Patton's overall approach to his book also appeared to be strongly influenced by my 1997 Inte rnet piece, A Truth Seeker Goes to Roswell, which is rep eated in this work for you. At least Patton mentioned me. My influe nce was also apparent in other ways. On page 41 he said (speaking of th e \"Federation of American Scientists' Mystery Aircra ft Report\"), \"The study pointed out the 'epistemological' problem s.,.\", \"too many sightings, too much information, too many po ssible planes—and yet not enough evidence.\" This was based on my chapter, \"Einst ein Was a New- Ager\", in which I explained how a person's epistemology—theory of knowledge, either Platon ist or Aristotelian—i nfluenced the way he either related, or failed to relate, to reality. Patton a pparently didn't know what epistemology meant, since what he was referring to was not epistemology, but ra ther a \"cognitive problem \", the inability to think. 87"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The most damning thing about Patton and his book was his failure to mention my influence on his writing, and his attempt to trivialize and misrepresent my book and what I actually said and its impact, while at the sa me time imitating me. The number of sightings, amount of information and number of aircraft relates not to an \"epistemologica l problem\", since the theory of knowledge for a scien tist should be assumed to be Aristotelian, based on the primacy of the senses as valid tools of cognition. A person with an \"epist emological problem\" shouldn't be a scientist. Aristotelian epistemology tell s one who obse rves a flying saucer/UFO, that it is a real flying machine. Epistemology in this case relates to what is real, and whether or not the aircraft observed actually exists or not. About that, there shou ld be no doubt in a scientist's mind, because so many of the people who have seen them are rational, experienced, professional, expert aircraft observers, yet the government set up Operation Bl ue Book at Wright-Patterson to intercept these sighting reports and classifiy them, to prevent public disclosure. If I saw a jet fighter and heard its engines from a distance, but its exact configuration was hazy, there is room for a difference of opinion as to whether it was an F-14 or an F-16, but not that it didn't exist at all, or wasn't an ai rcraft. That's the main reason that educated, supposedly rational peopl e who don't believe UFOs exist at all are the fools, not the people who report them. When so many expert aircraft observers—both civilian and military—have observed and repor ted UFOs, and just as many microbiological experts have reported germs seen through a microscope, you are a fool to believe they don't exist, even though you may never have seen a UFO or a germ. On the other hand, you are a fool to believe that a UFO is an \"alien\" UFO, because there is no evidence, and an enormous im probability that it is alien. Since UFOs are appare ntly flying machines, and since there is absolutely no evidence in the worl d of even a sing le machine being made by any being other than man (not including some insect 88"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"constructions and rocks used by ch imps and other animals, etc), it is completely rationa l to believe that A LL UFOs are man-made. With the current dictatorship ove r what scientists are allowed to say, the national security tamp ering with the area of UFOs has created a vacuum of public scientif ic knowledge concerning areas of science which \"don't make sens e\", yet which should be fully understood by the general student of science, especially when considering the advances of the past 100 years, which are being hidden from us today through government secr ecy. Consequently, on the issue of gravity, the pub lic is still stuck in the 17 th century with Newton, and Newton's \"corpuscul ar\" theory of lig ht is used as part of the cover- up of ether physics. This scientific vacuum is prim arily what I address in Occult Ether Physics, as the scientific di scoveries concerning the nature of gravity and electrodynamic propulsion made in the late 19 th century by Nikola Tesla, as th e crowning achievement of a whole series of experiments and studies toward th at same end, conducted by the world's greatest scientists. This period of physics, oddly enough, had been utterly \"ignored\", until the time I documented Tesla's electrodynamic discoveries in 1997-98, from books which were available but hard to get. 1 am still amazed that all th e other writers and so-called \"researchers\" on the UFO question, since 1947, when the German ships first became ev ident, had absolu tely failed to discover or write about the series of international scientif ic experiments and researches leading up to Tesla's su ccessful testing a nd proving of his concept in 1894, until 1 publi shed Occult Ether Physics. Tesla's 1894 tests were witnesse d by Marguerite Merrington, a famous New York dancer, am ong other friends of Tesla's. Merrington was interviewed by the FBI in 1943 1 concerning her witnessing of this discovery, soon after Tesla's death in 1943, during a national security investigation of Tesla's \"known associates\", in order to determine \"who knew what\" about the obviously 1 FBI Papers on Nikola Tesla, produced under the FOIA. 89"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"astounding Tesla secrets. The fact that the FBI apparently knew about the subject matter of Me rrington's observation and its enormous importance to space pr opulsion, yet ag reed with the government's \"scientific experts\", th at 'none of Tesla's discoveries were worth classifying' , suggests that there wa s a conspiracy between the FBI and the Nazi state. Other than to state that Merri ngton had witnessed \"...metallic plate suspensions...\" by Tesla (usi ng high voltage, high frequency currents), the details of the FBI's complete interview of Merrington have not been disclosed, which bri ngs us to the question, \"Why not? What more could Merrington ha ve confirmed with her 1894 observation, that the FBI and US government don't want us to know, 106 years later?\" But we know from books and publishings by or about Tesla from that time period, that each of th ose plates were solid zinc, 1/8\" x 12\" square, which if formed into a solid bar of metal, 1\" square, would be 18\" long, weighi ng several pounds. Having finally proved the principle for his \"electric flying machine\" with those pl ates, it was merely a matter of expanding the size of the plates large enough, and curving them to enclose a ship, having its own internal electrical generator (turned as Tesla said by one of his bladeless turbines), co mplete with pilot and controls. To compound the scientific i gnorance of the establishment physicists, the area of free energy, which incl udes Tesla's electric flying machine, had not been doc umented or explained until my books. In light of these ancient facts, it is ludicrous to consider the argument that \"the human race is incapable of building flying saucers which perform like that\". Consideri ng all the \"alien hype\" which the world has been subjecte d to since 1947, without a stitch of hard evidence of alien visitati ons to earth, The Roswell Hoax stands out as a monument to co rporate-state deceit and public gullibility. 90"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI - TH E ROSWELL HOAX: A Truth Seeker Goes to Roswell In late June, 1997, I was pleased to receiv e an invitation from Bonnie Lange of Truth Seeker to be their guest at the 50th anniversary festival of the \"Roswell Incident\". ...which I call \"The Roswell Hoax\".

While the presence of \"Ali enists\" among free thi nkers is tolerated, Alienists do not usually extend the same degree of fairness to those with whom they disagree, much le ss to an archenemy like myself. From my viewpoint, a CIA-employed \"skeptic\" like Philip Klass is not in \"my camp\", because the conditions of hi s employment forbid him from admitting the existence of man-made electro dynamic flying saucers. I knew th at, in fact, Klass is the primary protagonist of one side of a two-pronged strate gy designed specifically to conceal this exclusively man-made technology. Klass never denied his CIA employment, and neither did the \"fathers\" of the \"alien flying saucers\" movement of the 1950s. Many fail to under stand how this two-pronged strategy—employing the (pseudo) \"Skeptics\" and (pseudo) \"Believers\"—is used to lead the two packs of dupes and suckers, or that it was created by, and is contro lled by the CIA, or to understand why I encounter equal opposition from both these government-orchestrated groups.

I also knew that Jim had a law degree from the University of Denver, was a \"retir ed\" colonel, who had been in Air Force Intelligence, like myself, except he was in the Air Force O.S.L (\"Office of Special I nvestigations\"—not to be confused with the related spook outfit, \"O ffice of Scientific Intelligence\", or the Nuremberg Tribunal's \"Office of Sp ecial Investigations\"). Since Jim immediately attempted to hide his face, we didn't speak. The tall, dark-headed man left the area, and I passed Jim and approached the desk, signed in, and went to my room to unpack and settle in. Though several of my Santa Fe friends and I had known Jim for some time, none of us was pe rmitted into the house during the mysterious training, or were told the nature of the training Jim was giving \"The Two\". We initially t hought it was some sort of kinky sex thing. I had briefl y encountered the threes ome while they were out for coffee, a nd had momentarily entere d the house with a friend only once during the training period, when only Jim was present. Ever since the CIA- designed 1997 Heaven's Gate Mass Suicide Incident, which Jim knew I knew he was inextricably connected with, he has pretended to \"disappear\", as reported by the Santa Fe and Albuquerque papers. Having known Jim for over 25 years in 1997, I was well- versed on his various beliefs, including the Gurdjieff/Synergist teachings. That group had target ed me on several occasions, especially since I ha d exposed their undisclo sed agenda, twisted philosophy, and unethical tactic s. Add to this their CIA/OSI connections and misinformation agenda. It was not until 1975 or so that I became aware, primarily through news articles, that Jim had trained The Two as tools of the OSl/CIA's phony \"alien\" scenario. On e of their main jobs was to show up at the sites of \"cattle mutilations\" (m edical experiments) to create the false impression that the experiments were the result 95"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"of an occult group created by Ji m called \"O.S.I.R.I.S.\" (\"Outer Space International Research and I nvestigations Society\"). That bizarre conclusion was borne out by the fact that Jim had written a couple of news articles in 1975 about how a friend of his had joined the cult, while he was careful to conceal the fact that he had intensively trained the leaders of the cult fo r three months in Santa Fe in 1972, on contract for the CIA, followed by their immediate commencement of the cult activity he had designed and trained them to lead. When the nature of the false propaganda activities of the \"cult\" became obvious to me fro m articles in the papers, the kind of counterintelligence \"training\" given to them by Jim in 1972 became clear, and was 100% consistent with what I already knew about him, as well as the government's secr et programs which was confirmed by these facts. When I first met Jim, I was livi ng in my geodesic dome to the south of Santa Fe, while struggling to make a living and completing construction of my geodesic dome house, wh ich until 1974 had no running water, electricity, or phone. There were not many alternative social pathways in Sant a Fe at the time, so Jim's and my paths crossed constantly. Many of the women I dated were dated by Jim, which, as was later confirme d, was his way of using some of them as unwitting spies to gather information on me. Since my 1975 rejection of George Bush's offer to become a high-paid intellectual whore for the CIA, Jim had apparen tly been entrusted to continue the recruitment of me through other means. In 1977, on learning th at I had been study ing petroglyphs with the intention of writing a book, Ji m came to my house, and to my utter astonishment, actu ally attempted to hire me to write books on behalf of the governme nt saying the petrogl yphs were the writings of ancient extraterrest rials. He said the publishing arrangements were already set up in Sedona, an d that I would enjoy instant success through promotions and di stribution, if I accepted. Even though I greatly needed the mone y, I not only rejected the (OSI) offer, but asserted my intent and determinatio n to publish my flying 96"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"saucer book—a project which Jim was already aware of. Jim then threatened to cause harm to me if I published my saucer book. I was a littl e shocked that Jim had the bad manners to come to my home as a supposed \"friend\", with a proposal to hired me to write fraudulent books for th e CIA. But following that up with a violation of my hospitality , threatening me with harm if I exercised my freedom of the pr ess and speech by publishing my book, was too much. Though dismayed by threats fr om such a puny guy, little did I realize that I would subsequently be subjected to the covert power he and hi s associates wielded. Ever since that time, and the nu merous events which followed, our \"friendship\"—which apparently never existed—\"deteriorated\" (i.e., became obvious for what it wa s). That was the background between Jim and I, which extende d back to 1972, preceding the 1997 Roswell gathering. Over the previ ous twenty-five years, I had seen Jim often, but following th e 1977 failed attempt by him to recruit me as a false propaganda wr iter, any discussion or attempt at politeness was oversha dowed by the secret know ledge that we both had. It was apparent that Jim wa s made very uncom fortable by my presence at the Roswell gathering, especially since it was so soon after the Heaven's Gate debacle. After checking into my room, I called Ron Garner, and we both headed for the lobby to meet . On seeing Garner, I recognized him as the man I'd just seen w ith Jim, which probably explained Jim's extreme discomfort. I said noth ing to Garner about it, and took him to my room so he could examine it as a potential video interview room. When we returned to the lobby, I to ld Ron that the man I identified as a M.I.B. in my bo ok was present in the lobby. He asked me to point him out so he could get so me video footage of him, but when I pointed out Jim, Ron became distur bed. He soon took his leave, and avoi ded me for the rest of the conference, never contacting me again, or seeking to use my room for interviews. Toward the end of the conference, I spoke briefly with Garner, and asked him if he got the video footage of the \"M.I.B.\". He pretended that he didn 't know who Jim was. That was implausible, 97"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"since I had seen Ron conversing cl osely with Jim only a few minutes before, and because you couldn't miss Jim when I pointed him out, with such a weird hat. The hat wa s apparently a covert means of instant identification of Jim, by his intelligence operative peers, other dupes and phonies, from within the crowd. On meeting some others of the Truth Seeker contingent a day or so later, I was surprised to lear n that Ron had engaged them in behind-the-scenes discussions about me the morning after my arrival, regarding my views on Gurdjieff, his teachings, and the Synergy cult. Since I hadn't discusse d any of this with anyone at the conference except Jim, years before , I assumed that Ron's objections were based on Jim's objections, since the two were obviously connected. The owner of Truth Seekers, Bonny Lange, must have been aware of my attitude to ward the Gurdjieff/Syne rgy cult, since I had made it clear in my book, which I assumed she had re ad, so I found it hard to believe that this was an integral pa rt of the Truth Seeker philosophy. Jim's behavior didn't surprised me, since he had interfered in my life on many occasions in the past , but I was taken aback by the prior connection between Jim and another Truth Seeker representative, Garner. In fact, Ji m had also been connected through the Gurdjieff relation ships, with the natu ropath I mention in Pentagon Aliens, who had attempted to murder me w ith arsenic, and almost succeeded. The naturopath was an avid Gurdjieff/Synergy cultist. The Synergy cult is featured very strongly in my unpublished manuscript entitled The Mystical Roots of Totalitarianism. Unfortunately, there are apparently quite a few people who are followers of Gurdjieff's teachings, apparently without full cognizance of the social consequences which have flowed from them as a matter of logic. At the time of the Roswell gather ing, I was aware that Jim had become especially paranoid about me because I had already publicly identified him in my 1993 and 1995 ed itions of Space Aliens as a CIA/OSI connection, four years pr ior to the Heaven's Gate cult's 98"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"alleged \"mass suicide\" in 1997. Th is must have be en particularly disturbing to Jim, given the cult's sensationalized mass deaths, which appeared to be a way for the CIA to \"close out\" the cult, perhaps because it had become a \"liability\" after my exposure of them and the OSI's 'handling' of them th rough Jim, and since they were becoming a geriatric group, wh ich had failed to produce any significant counterinte lligence thought-control propaganda for quite a while. Like loose cannons, th ese old OSI dupes were rolling around on the \"national se curity decks\", and ha d to be belayed for good, as their \"ship\" wa s sent to Davy Jone's Locker, instead of to a comet. Jim was apparently in fear th at I would go public, and because of his continued tampering, I did go public, in Space Aliens. In my unpublished Synergy manuscript, I go into more detail as to how the cultists believe that th ey are especially entitled to appropriate and use the resources of others in purs uit of a \"higher purpose\", defined only by them, pursuant to the \"collective cons ciousness\" teachings of Gurdjieff (which is in line with the recurring \"appropriation\" of my ideas). Though Gurdjieff was apparently irresponsible when it came to contemplating the natural cons equences which would follow from his teachings, he was appalled when those results in cluded the mass murders by the S.S. \"Death's H ead\" Schwarze Korps (the Black Order, which was the S.S. planni ng branch), in the concentration camps of Europe, and the murder of millions in Russ ia under Stalin, a former Gurdjieff student. I became a target of the cult when I blew the cover on its infiltration of an arts group I headed in 1977-78, called Free Art Forum. The Synergy cult is es pecially attracted to the destruction of individualistic groups, wh ich they see as thei r primary enemies and competitors, so they infiltrate them, neutralize them through the introduction of immiscible contra dictions, and ta ke over and use their resources in pursuit of thei r synergistic totalitarian goals. The cult typically uses a \"divide-a nd-conquer\" strategy, based on the conspiratorial equi valent to the Spar tan \"flying wedge\". 99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"I had attempted to block their infiltration and appropriation of my group, but the Gurdjie ff cult succeeded de spite my resistance, just as the grant which funded it was about to expire. After the take- over, the group degenera ted and was destroye d from within by its own \"synergistic\", vi cious in-fighting. The State of New Mexico then of fered me a grant for twice the amount of the origin al one—$250,000—but I turned it down because the state and federal governm ent had refused to give me the protection I requested from the Gurdjieff group, as I eventually burned out fro m the social turmoil it created. Besides, I had initially been conned into becoming a partne r in the grant under the false promise that I wouldn't be dealin g with the government, since I am philosophically opposed to the govern ment's involvemen t in the arts, per se, or in any other private cultural activity. True to form, Jim's book offer to me, just after he learned of my involvement in the grant, appear ed to be also intended to draw me out of Free Art Forum, so the Synergy group—some of whom had already been hired by my duped partner—could take it over immediately. I battled along, con tinuing to control the group until the grant period expired, with tr emendous wear and tear on my nerves, with the Synergists mispl acing blame on me for their failure to make what was left of the group work for their \"purposes\". Soon after the end of Free Art Fo rum, Jim had l earned through contact with my then current gi rlfriend that I had discovered his covert contact with my father in Arizona, after which my father had come to New Mexico in an attempt to convin ce me to abandon my UFO publishing plans, which asto unded me at the time, until I discovered Jim's involve ment. Thinking my fa ther had disobeyed him, by telling me of his threats, Jim arranged th rough the CIA/OSI for my parents to lose their business. The fact was, I had discovered Jim's contact with my father thr ough an independen t witness whom my parents didn't even know.

The buyers droppe d the clothing lines in protest, and the manufacturers lost millions of dollars, for following the CIA's orders. Justice can come in strange forms sometime, and that was \"poetic justice \", but the CIA hasn't gotten what is coming to it yet. As the conference progressed, I observed disappointment growing among the Truth Seeker c ontingent. The major portion of the crowd which showed up was not of the big-spender variety. As I saw it, the stated goals of Truth Seeker were in conflict with some of the material in their catalogue, es pecially where it played into the CIA-orchestrated \"alien\" scenar io. For example, I immediately recognized the material of Zechar iah Sitchin as a continuation of some of GurdjiefPs and Georg Lanz von LiebenfePs stories, the same as those he had, as the Cisternian monk Jose ph Lanz, earlier taught to a youthful Adolph Hi tler at Lambach Abbey in 1907. They were the same \"teachings\" spr ead by the Thulegesells chaft, now promoted by the CIA and reflected in the script of th e movie Stargate, and continued by the TV series, Starga te SG-1. It also persues the OSI strategic objectives of the offer made to me by Jim in 1977. Several questions arose in my mi nd: If Garner's objection to my involvement with Truth Seeker was based on his adherence to GurdjiefPs teachings, was Truth Seek er being targeted for takeover by the Synergy cult? Was I being \"separated out\" by the \"flying wedge\" of Garner, becau se I was threatening to undo the cult's efforts? That would certainly upset Jim, as I had observed. Did Jim know I was being hosted by Truth Seek ers before my a rrival, or did he learn about it from Ron? Sin ce my appearance seemed to come as a complete and devastating surp rise to Jim, was it because he knew that I, of all people, might figure out the latest scam-in- progress? Ron's objections based on the Gu rdjieff stuff indicated either 101"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that Jim had manipulated Ron thro ugh those beliefs, or that they were of common interest to both Ji m and Ron, and that Jim feared I would blow their cover. After all, hadn't Sitchin written the same kind of books that the CIA had atte mpted to recruit me to write in 1977, and weren't they often published in Sa nta Fe or Sedona? Did they really think they could co nvert the Truth Seeker idea to a Gurdjieff one? If so, they would have to change the name to \"Big Lie Seeker\". Such a conversion would make the Truth Seeker goals only a fake shell eaten out by the Synergy roaches, to be used as a facade to entrap more prey. The Truth Seeker movement was barely getting off the ground at the tim e, so a takeover by the Synergists would nip it in the bud. It beca me my intent to avert this, and to warn them, but it was apparently to no avail. The moth f lies around and near the candle flame, and is eventual ly consumed by it. There was apparently no way to warn the moth against its basic attraction to the flame. By my second day at the gather ing, I was already effectively ostracized by the major portion of the group, excep t for the two writers, David Sielaff and Paul Ti ce, whom I had met at the UFO Enigma Museum. John Price, \"h ead\" of the museum—a local guy who was strangely jealous and afraid of losing his grip on what little notoriety he had—woul dn't sell my books, so I joined the two writers at a table in the back room. They se emed congenial and I detected no conflict with them. I made the best of the moment. Ahh...there I was at the dusty little museum , standing not more than three feet from Linda Moulton Howe, a UFOlogy \"biggie\", as she discussed \"aliens\" with a Mr. Heik, with the same kind of familiarity as one might expect a believer in the Tooth Fairy to describe the kind of sh oes he wears. Though in plain sight, the total invisibility with which Howe rega rded me indicated that she not only knew who I was, but also that I knew what she was, and that her pretense was transparent to me . Unless she knew she was lying about aliens, she would never have graduated from Stanford. At the Truth Seeker booth at the Roswell Convention Center, the available chairs were occupi ed by the secretary, the shipping 102"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"clerk, and astrologer Louis Turi, who used the only other chair and a table for his clients, so I milled about and made contact with some interesting people. Ron Garner had avoided me lik e the plague since the first evening. After learning of his character assassi nation of me behind my back the next morning, the nega tive behavior of several others associated with the group seemed explainable, but they were only the 'spear bearer' contingent. Af ter being snubbed by three of the group—Garner, the secret ary, and the shippi ng clerk—and several minor associates, it seemed that my ostracism had become final by my second day there, over somethi ng I hadn't discus sed with them, and which should have been anathema to Truth Seeker. Did they not know? Had it been up to me, the secr etary and shipping clerk would have remained in San Diego to hold down business. Louis Turi could have had a separa te booth, since there seemed to be only a tenuous connection between \"truth\" and \"astrology\", but conceding the fact that knowledge of as trology might come in handy for understanding national l eaders—and nuts like Hitler, who guided the Third Reich to Valhalla with it. Turi was more polite, and showed no signs of being in the pe tty conspiracy; as astrologers go, he is the best I have met. It didn't seem appropriate that the behavior of a secretary and shipping clerk, provoked by an \"outside\" vide ographer, was controlling the fate of the opera tion. True to the philosophy, Synergism, like the Hitler it spawned, teaches its foll owers to strike at weakness, like true sociopaths. Meanwhile, I wondered if the only strong members of th e group remaining—Siel aff and Tice—would eventually succumb to the Synergy garbage. The Synergists are opposed to individuality, and will use \"latitudinal\" arguments and strategy to motivate their prey. That is where the CIA got the tactic. In f act, Gurdjieff had privately tutored Mao Zedong, Stalin, Alfred Rosenb erg, Karl Hausho ffer, Dietrich Eckhardt and many others of the to talitarian mind, and there were many Gurdjieff adepts in Reinhard Gehlen's SS Gestapo group, the 103"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"RSHA VI, which became th e core of the OSI in America. These teachings had been th e basis of the Communi st movements of Mao and Stalin, as well as that of the Nazis. The Nazi troop management manual, authored by Ernst Rohm—a lso a student of Gurdjieff—had found its way into U.S. armed forces policy, wh en the official Nazi manual was adopted by the U.S. Congress in the 1950's, as the official U.S. troop management manual. The general policy is recognized today as the \"principle of group id entity\", which is a direct translation of the \"colle ctive consciousness\" doctrine of Gurdjieff, as espoused by Captai n Ernst Rohm, \"Father of the Brownshirts\", the bully-boys respons ible for Krystallnacht in the Nazi rise to power. Since scapegoating is a typical t actic of the Synergists, I could expect an attempt back in San Di ego to create and heighten a sense of failure of the venture, and to misplace blame for the lack of success somehow on me. This would mean that a heavy trip would be laid on me to Bonnie Lange. Whether this was another divide- and-conquer/takeover maneuve r, only time would tell. A short time after the Roswell de bacle, I tried to warn Bonnie Lange about the Synergists, and she assured me everything was \"under control\". Soon afterward, sh e offered me an opportunity to write a series of articles abou t \"Tesla's Technology in Today's World,\" which I have included in this book, in updated form. I finished and submitted the firs t installation of my series of articles, and Bonnie accep ted and praised it, with a lot of editorial cutting by her staff. Sh e said it would be publis hed in the magazine, and would also be published on th eir Internet web site. I waited patiently for news that the article had been published. In January 1998 I got on the Internet for the fi rst time, and opened a web site of my own — \"Penta gon Space A l i e n s \" http://members.tripod.com/~lvne4l vne/ . In browsing the Truth Seeker site, I not only failed to find my article, or the cataloguing of my book, but also noticed that the Synergy people had become a prominent \"partner\" in their orga nization. That, to me, suggested that the Synergists had either taken over Truth Seeker, or had 104"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"conned Bonnie into a partnership. This of course appeared to explain the reversal of policy, and the ex clusion of my book and article without notice to me. I hoped that my attempts to warn Bonnie and Truth Seeker would eventually start to make sense, in time to save the operation and to separate it from the Synerg ists. It was sad to see an old American institution wh ich had formerly been associated with such powerful individualists as Mark Twain and Robert G. Ingersoll, being taken over by the enemy. Wi th a lofty stated purpose which was, among other things, intended \"...to elevate and emancipate the human race\", and was opposed to \" ...everything that degrades or burdens mankind mentally or physically\", it was tragic that the organization seemed to be selling out its birt hright to synergistic totalitarianism, which is diametrica lly opposed to everything it stood for. When they entered that door, they risked becoming the ultimate hypocrisy, selling the CIA'b acked lies about \"aliens\", while pretending to be \"seekers of tr uth\". I knew that there was no way they could close that door behi nd them for good, without losing their identity as \"seekers of truth\" , since that is in conflict with being suckers for covert government propaganda. Among the Internet \"free-thought\" links of the Truth Seekers, I was saddened and appalled by th e creepy Synergy gr oup's featuring of sleazy \"Japanimation\" porn car toons, clearly appe aling to sick pedophiles, with illustrati ons of things li ke child sex, sn uff, torture, bondage and sadism. These were only cartoons, but the mental attitude appealed to wa s unmistakable. This link misrepresented and effectively smeared the idea of fr ee-thought, falsely equating it with pedophilia, sadism, child sexual abuse, torture and murder. This clearly wasn't opposed to \"everything that degrades or burdens mankind mentally or phys ically\", but more its opposite. Since when have the secr et cravings of sex cr iminals been elevated to the level of \"...brave new thou ghts\"? Why didn't they feature some saucy sex scenes from the to rture chambers of Treblinka or Dachau while they were at it?

As a Libertarian, I don't advocat e censorship of any speech or thought whatsoever, but consider these bizarre public associations between Truth Seekers and the sexual exploita tion of children by the Synergists, to be an attempt to give the \"kiss of death\" to the Truth Seeker ideology, suggesting approval of something which is not endemic to \"free thought \", as a kind of fraud. It's a good thing such groups don't hold an exclusive franchise on that thing called \"fr ee thought\", since, in the event of their demise, there might be no one to pick up the torch of truth and carry it forward from where they fell.

Here, I give a brief overview of covert intelligen ce agency opera tions in the UFO field, point out the presence of agents posing as \"UFOlogists\" or \"Skeptics\", along with the \"offic ial government spokesmen\", and show how they intermesh to mainta in control of the field. I also highlight the incredible, statistica lly-challenging complicity of many dupes, who seem to be unaware of CIA control. I also describe the CIA's \"M.O.\", for use as a measur ing instrument to detect CIA influence, control or complicity . I also describe some of my experiences with the military, the government, political parties, the CIA and military intelli gence agencies, as ba ckground information which influences my judgments. Ther efore, in this chapter let us step back and take an objective look at the UFOlogy field through my eyes, as I address the following, in part: ► That American \"fuz zy\" UFOlogy and the \"alien\" scenario were created by the government a nd CIA, as heir to the Nazi mass-psychology program, to conceal exclusively man-made UFOs, and enlarge the credulity of the public, to facilitate its acceptance of other Big Lies. ► That early (post WW II) UFO reports, books and movies, written by CIA'directed spooks, gave the public whatever misinformation the CIA wanted it to have. (Example: Kenneth Arnold's sightings ha ve been debunked...as a false report describing saucers as boomerang-shaped... Arnold worked for the spooks.) ► That the 1947 \"Roswell Incident\" was created by the government, which initiated th e first \"credible\" \"alien- visitors\" premise in its initia l press releases by intelligence 107"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"officer Walther Haut (a \"P.I .O.\", or Public Information Officer, an intelligence position) . The news release was then redacted, making it look like a cover-up. CIA-directed UFOlogy picked up from there on out. ► That, in 1955, the ma jor nations...including Russia...had a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland , and agreed to keep UFO reports secret from the public. They all had UFO technology, so they weren't hiding it from each other. ► That subsequent public \"UFO re ports\" were filtered through the government's Project Bl uebook, etc. Bl uebook was a CIA/OSI project designed to 'i ntercept' the public's reports, to prevent the disclosure to the public of what was actually seen. \"Real\" reports were ke pt secret, a nd only CIA- fabricated, misinformational reports were \"released\". ► That UFO technology is primarily an ener gy and transportation secret, having th e potential to end control by the world's corporate and totalitarian states and the coercive- monopolist corporate power stru cture. Concealment of the technology relates to maintaining the grip of coercive- monopolist status quo, not to \"national security\". The CIA's Omnipres ence in UFOlogy In the world of UFO literature , the CIA has been pervasive. Even though some of th is is partly paranoid im aginings, when all the pure paranoia is swept aside, th e CIA's presence is still conspicuous in regard to UFOs. This pres ence is incongruous, given the government's official denials of the existence of UFOs: That is, unless one accepts the thesis whic h I put forth in my books, which is perfectly logical. It is also perf ectly consistent that the CIA created \"fuzzy UFOlogy\" (the CIA would in fact ha ve been remiss in its 108"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"duties if it hadn't done so), throu gh the covert branches of the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI). As an intelligence operation, i nvested with the duty to carry out its duties for the coercive-mo nopolies and the government, there were two paramount \"strategic objectives\" which the OSI was required to pursue, which were (1 ) to conceal the science of UFO electro dynamic space propulsion technology, by whatever means necessary, and (2) to enlarge the public's credulity so it would believe the \"space alien\" lies, and whatever ot her lies of a more political nature that the government wished it to. In keeping with these two strate gic objectives, I have outlined what I consider to be the OSI m odus operandi in pursuit of them, covered probably more ex tensively in Pentagon Aliens. By measuring a certain UFOlogist's or Paranorma list's M.O. against that of the OSI, one can ascertain the relative pr obability that he or she (don't forget \"Linda Molting Cow\") eith er takes their marching orders directly from the CIA, or is so cozy with the CIA that it really doesn't matter whether or not they are on its payroll. Since they virtually do its work for it as if they were, they either wittingly help the CIA, or else are incredibly stupid dupes. Either way, all UFOlogists are 'incriminated', either by their actual witting employment by the CIA, or by their negligence in failing to realize their own complicity when under a duty to find out, as a \"responsible investigator.\" An admitted association with the CIA once enhanced a UFOlogist's credibility. This prev iously decorative veneer has eroded away over the years to reveal shabby und erlying layers of cheap fabrications and lies, due to th e many incidents which have made the CIA's name synonymous with dishonest and untrustworthy behavior. Today, UFOl ogists whose covers as CIA operatives have been blown are usually washed up. Naturally, such UFOlogists try to maintain their covers.

As Phil grimaced, I exclaimed, \"Sheesh, Phil! Are you so tight you have to use an agency lock?\". One of the things which once we nt with intell igence agency enhancement was the assumption th at a UFOlogist who had access to Project Bluebook's secret repor ts—to which norm al citizens had NO access—should be accepted as pate ntly truthful and accurate. This is ridiculous, since that UFOlogist would be subject to prosecution under the National Secur ity Act for disclosing classified information, and whatever is im plied from the secret reports, without producing the act ual classified report s, is mere hearsay. The aura of \"high credentials\" is now used to enhance the \"credibility\" of UFOlogists, to indu ce acceptance of CIA- concocted lies, to convince the pub lic that UFOs are extr aterrestrial, that the government conducts secret liaisons with alien civilizations—based on alleged \"leaks\" from \"inside\" sources—or that human life on earth was \"engineered\" by \"reptilian aliens\". These are the favorite BIG lies used by the CIA's OSI to achieve th eir two most important strategic objectives. The prolific use of allegedl y \"classified doc uments\" from \"inside sources\" ignores the fact that such documents would have been retrieved at the point of a gun, and contained by the 110"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"intelligence community , with their purveyors prosecuted, while the public availability of the docum ents marks them as fraudulent fabrications, created and dissemin ated by intelligen ce agencies in pursuit of so-called strategic objectives. The frequent use of credib ility-enhanced, professional UFOlogists, with high ac ademic or military titl es, such as \"Ph.D.\", \"Colonel\", etc., naturally raises the question as to why those with such \"high\" credentials would invol ve themselves in attempting to derive incomes as befits their educ ations from the ri sky business of UFOlogy, unless they were already pr ovided with substantial covert incomes from intelligence coffers. In their writings and speeches, it seems that these UFOlogists will i nvariably only ci te the alleged \"documentation\" of other CIA a ssets. This incestuous, fraudulent process is a matter of CIA UFOlogy policy, to never cite another researcher unless they are a controlled asset, in order to maintain control of the whole field, thus av oiding unpredictable results which might threaten that control. My Mind and Thought-Control Ordeals A well-known \"UFOl ogy lawyer\"—who is himself a CIA tool—apparently alarme d that I \"had his num ber\", accused me of attempting to use my \"credentials\" (what cr edentials?) to gain credibility (his own tactic) but the only association I ever had with an intelligence agency was my shor t stint in Air Fo rce Intelligence, in 1957-58, at a pay of around $160.00 per m onth. I subsequently have had minimal contact with the intelligence co mmunity, in the sense that, on occasion, on a voluntary basis, as a concerned citizen, I tried to warn our government, whenever I perceived what I believed to be threat s to American safety, security and well-being. Here, I briefly describe some (but not all) of my encounters in which, as a would-be responsible citizen, I rendered considerable service to my country several times, \"..above and beyond the call of duty...\", and in every si ngle case, I was punish ed, insulted, abused, injured and dishonored. I was ne ver so much as given a \"thank 111"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"you\". Instead of being thanked or ho nored even in the slightest way, I was severely and cruelly punis hed. It came as a severe and traumatic shock to my naive and idealistic mind to think that my government would not only allow such things to be done to me, but to do them to me itse lf. I suffered deeply because of it, and the indelible and painfu l marks on my mind will never go away. In my first experience, at the ag e of 18, as an Air Force basic trainee in 1956, I had uncovered a 5-man cell of KGB agents running the Air Force Career C ounseling Center, at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas sabotaging personnel r ecords, mis- assigning trainees, and even rout ing their own agents in to Air Force Counter- intelligence. This discovery created a chain reaction which eventually 'rolled over ' on Col. Rudolf Abel (alias William Fisher), the Soviet Western Hemisphe re Chief of KGB Espionage Operations, whose special training was in sabotage. The FBI, on its website, says Abel was arrested in New York City around June 21 st, 1957, but this may be a cover-st ory lie. The FBI ta kes credit for everything, another lie. If I hadn' t discovered the cell, operating right under the noses of the \"counterintelligenc e experts\" for years, they would probably have never known who Abel was. The Texas cell was handled by Mikhail Nikolaevich Svirin, Soviet ambassador to the U.N., Col. Abel's subordinate and intermediary to the cell. Svirin got wind of my exposure of his spies and immediately returned to Mo scow, leaving no intermediary. Lucky for Eisenhower, Sv irin had diplomatic immunity, so the FBI didn't have to arrest or to stop him from returning to Moscow, the Soviet government didn't have to lodge a noisy and falsely indignant protest with the American embassy or the U.N., and the Republicans didn't have to explai n how this very serious national security breach occurred under their administration. The arrest of the Russian ambass ador to the U.N. for espionage would certainly have aroused pub lic suspicion, and the FBI had strict orders to avoid public e xposure of the inci dent. Meanwhile, the FBI still didn't know who Svirin 's superior was. That was the way things remained until 1957, a year later. 112"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Conveniently for the FBI, Finnish KGB agent Reino Hayhanen had defected in May, 1957, in Pa ris, and was moved in by the FBI to fill Svirin's slot in Abel's sabotage and espi onage network, enabling him to identif y Abel. Abel was arre sted, charged with espionage, prosecuted, convicted and sentenced, and was eventually traded for U-2 pilot Gary Francis Powers in 1962. Because I had uncovered Abel's Air Force records-sabotage operation, the Air Force, wit hout my knowledge at the time, ostensibly re-assigned me to Ai r Force Intelligence immediately following the confirmation of my disc overy. After what should have been the perception by the Air Force that I might be useful in the intelligence field, th e Air Force then proceeded under an ulterior Republican-created political agenda to attempt to assassinate me, then to punish me, then to completely wast e and ruin whatever potential or talent I ma y have had for intellig ence work, after its attempt to murder me failed, which instea d of killing me, \"only\" caused a permanent neur ological disability. From a consideration of the circumstances, my knowledge, and the evidence I have gathered thus far, it appears that \"Republican intelligence agents\" and Air Force s pooks tricked me into taking a prescripti on of a neurotoxic drug , by having an agent give me a cup of bad coffee during a student coffee break, thus requiring me to go to si ck call, where it was arranged that a doctor prescribe the poisonous drug which was then given to me by the pharmacist. It was the pure, \"100% extract of belladonna\", rather than the 10% \"tincture\" solution, a dosage which was ten times the prescribed dosage. Therefore, th e dosage—\"24 drops of in warm water before meals, three times per day\" (72 drops per day)—was the equivalent to 720 dr ops of tincture of be lladonna per day, and clearly a potentially le thal dosage, with little doubt remaining that the intent was to effect my death, to be explained posthumously as a \"suicide\" or \"acc idental overdose\". On Nov. 6, 1956, the presidenti al election was held, and Ike had won. Before I had even met Commander Thomas B. Hayward, I had already been poisoned a nd had survived. As a Republican 113"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"naval officer, connected to the O.N.I, Hayward's job apparently had to do with carrying out an illegal political order from the Eisenhower Re-election Committee—possibly on request from Vice-President Richard Nixon or the fanatical right wing SAC head, General LeMay—to shut me up at all costs. The first indication that the spooks were involved in my fate was when I had been chosen just prior to the poisoning, by an Air borne jumpmaster who had come to Keesler, to be the \"combat cont roller\", in Ike's co ntemplated U.S. military intervention in Hungary during the revo lt of 1956. This was apparently a \"last minute\" grands tand play concocted either by Eisenhower or Nixon—mor e likely by Nixon—to \"insure\" their re- election. I'll wager that Nixon pus hed it and Eisenhow er stopped it. As the Combat Contro ller, I would have b een the first man on the ground, where I was to set up a landing operation for our entire invasion, spearheaded by airborne divisions, and to land our planes in a massive assault. It was a tall order for an 18-year-old kid. I was led to believe that I was chosen because I was in superb physical condition, knew how to shoot, and was pretty tough. They wanted a man who could survive at least l ong enough to carry out the job of getting our forces on the ground so they could engage the Russian troops. Like a fool, I was rea dy, willing and ab le to do it. In retrospect, I real ized that I would ha ve probably been one of the first men killed, thus eliminating any further problem of a possible leak regarding the KGB's record-setting records-sabotage operation. There would have been a 97% chance of my being killed in the operation. Lucky for me, th e plan to intervene in Hungary was abandoned by Eisenhower, so it wa s time for plan of elimination of Airman William Lyne #2, which was to poison me. Here is a case where covert intelligence op eratives within the military were involved in a pure ly partisan, atte mpted political assassination of a loyal American military man to cover up a politically explosive spy scandal, because it mi ght have prevented a Republican politician's re -election. And for that reason alone, they actually coddled the Soviet agents, and helped the Soviets keep the spy scandal secret from the American and Russian people! 114"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"After I had begun to take the belladonna as prescribed—which was the equivalent of 720 drops of tincture of belladonna per day—I became so confused that I did not ev en realize that my disorientation was caused by the belladonna. Bella donna is a hypnotic neurotoxin, composed of several alkaloids, including sc opolamine, one of the drugs of choice for Nazi SS interro gators during WW II. Because of its horrible effects, it could induce many subjects to talk rather than to be forced to endure another dos e of the drug. According to one of my dictionaries, scopolamine is, \"A drug used to dilate pupils of eyes, as a depressant, to produce a partial st upor known as \"twilight sleep\", and to induce confession in criminals.\" At that point, I began to have uncontrollable sleep attacks in class, which caused th e instructors to begin disciplinary measures, and to do such things as to slap a stick loudl y on the table in front of me whenever I began to drop off. This caused PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). Even when being hum iliated, by being ordered to stand at attention during class in front of a large floor fan having no protective grille on it, I st ill fell asleep. Thanks to a quick- thinking fellow student, who bloc ked my fall just as I lost consciousness, and was falling into the fan blades, a serious accident was narrowly averted. I was then cruelly hauled before boards of review, in my disoriented state, where I was ordered to explain why I kept falling asleep in class. I c ould only answer, \"I don't know, Sir, but I can't help it.\" I was then ordered to appear before the commandant of the GCA school—an eccentri c warrant officer, who wore Napoleonic locks (I swear I'm not ma king this up)—joined by a master sergeant named Ackermann. The two promised me that, if I could make it through the school, they would make me a part of their in telligence \"team\" on a covert mission into Po rt Said, Egypt. I found out that the warrant officer and the serg eant were both colonels, using assumed names and ranks. It appeared that they were unaware that I was being poisoned. Meanwhile, I was still unawa re that the belladonna was even a po ison, or that it was cau sing the problem, so I could produce no plausible excuse , or even bring up the issue. My 115"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"judgment was severely clouded, to say the least. The two officers must have been Democrats, w ho were unaware of the secret Republican plan to eliminate me, unless the \"covert mission\" was another plan of elimination. About that time, as I was visiti ng the base serv ice club in the evening, I was appro ached by two intelligenc e agents, and asked, \"Are you William R. Lyne, AF 18510695?\" I answered \"Yes.\" One of the agents then said , \"We're here to inform you that the KGB cell you uncovered at Lackland was caught. Your report to the adjutant turned out to be true. We are breaking security procedures by even telling you about this , because the incident is classified, so don't tell anyone we are involved. We know you are having tr oubles, so we will try to help you.\" Belladonna in such a hi gh dosage makes you look and act like a zombie, a virtual \"living dead\". I could neither sl eep restfully at night, nor awaken fully during the day. At night, I began to hang out alone in the numerous dives in Biloxi, Mississippi. Due to my disorientation, my inab ility to explain my sudd en sleep attacks, and the morbid and melancholy effect s of the belladonna, together with my being washed out of the GCA school at no fault of my own, I became very distraught, even suic idal. I had been a top student, wide-awake and promising, but I was going down, and there was nothing I could do in my drugged state of mind to stop it. While in one of the Biloxi bars , after midnight on a weekend, I was visited again by two different intelligence agents, who said they would try to help me, even though regulations prohib ited them from doing so. In retrospect, years later, th at all seemed so very strange to me, that they had to \"violate regula tions\" in order to help an airman who had discovered a KGB cell, do ne his fellow Air Force members a great service, saved the taxpayers many milli ons of dollars, and was being poisoned, washed out of his school, and demoted. Again, these guys didn't seem to be part of the political assa ssination squad, because they didn't try to a ttribute blame to the KGB. As professional intelligence agents, at least they knew that the KGB couldn't have manipulated everyt hing on the base. They probably 116"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"knew my \"problems\" were political ones anyway, but couldn't say more. There being absolutely no legal representative to fight for me, even myself, while under diminish ed capacity, in a stupor, I signed whatever papers they put before me, just to try to make the problems go away. After I was re moved from the school, demoted, fined, and placed on menial deta il, I stopped taking the belladonna. The extreme melancholia subsided, but the symptoms of narcolepsy remained. At that point, in spite of th e poisoning, I had survived. In retrospect, I now realize that, befo re the November 6th election, I was supposed to die from a \"dr ug overdose\", undoubtedly to be explained subsequently as a \"proba ble suicide\", due to my \"apparent despondency over being washed out of the school\", a despondency which they had so skillf ully created through the MK-Ultra, trauma- based mind control methods, by wh ich time the bottle of uncut belladonna extract would probably have be en replaced by a \"10% tincture solution\", to cove r the conspirators' tracks. But my survival had created a nother problem: To prevent me from discovering that the poisoning had caused the \"discipline\" problems and the narcolepsy, and fr om realizing that it was part of the Republican plan to eliminat e me. That was when Republican Tom Hayward was chosen to visit with me. The spooks must have asked themselves, \"Who is an ab solutely loyal, trustworthy Republican offi cer, who can be relied upon to do our dirty work, to go to Keesler, to gain Lyne's confidence, and convince him that the KG B, and not the Republican party or the Air Force is responsible for his brain in jury?\" The fact that Hayward was Navy and not Air Force, should ha ve told me that the problem originated outside the Air Force, but after all, I was still taking the drug, and my judgment was clouded. The drug also enhances one's suggestibility, so mething discovered by Na zi interrogators. Eddie Hayward, Tom Hayward's younger br other, was my roommate and friend, in whom I sometimes conf ided, so that, together with Hayward's high ra nk—his \"enhanced credibilit y\"—could be used to 117"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"convince me that neither the Ai r Force nor the Republican party had anything to do with my st range, inexplicable problems. The idea that all th e circumstances—such as my medical condition—would be unknown to the intelligence ag encies during the bogus \"national security\" cove rt operation, was ludicrous. In such a case, every single circum stance would be known. The Air Force knew all along why I was havi ng uncontrollable sleep attacks, because they had ordered the poisoni ng, and they knew exactly what the effects of belladonna in a large dosage would be. After I had survived, and exhibite d for the first time the classic symptoms of narcolepsy , they also kn ew, in November, 1956, what the medical profession did not l earn until the year 2000, that narcolepsy could be caused by the ingestion of neurotoxins, because they can destroy specialized protei n cells in the hypothalamus which produce hypocretin (A.K .A. \"orexin\"), the hor mone which regulates sleep and diet. Of cour se, hypocretin had not even been discovered in 1956, but the Air For ce knew very well that I had been converted from an exceptionally sharp-witted and \"wide awake\" airman, to a narcoleptic after i ngestion of the drug. There was no longer any talk of making me part of a \"covert intelligence team.\" By that time, the Air Force knew that I was permanently damaged. I could no longer cons ider becoming a jet pilot or an air traffic controller, because I had narcolepsy, and they knew it. In fact, one of the 'c ounselors' they sent me to, a disgruntled major (who was not a psychologist, but had been assigned to a detail counseling ai rmen, because he had a college course in psychology), told me I had narcolepsy, but then misinformed me, saying that it was a purely \"psychological problem\"—a \"defense mechanism\"—w hich was my \"...attempt to avoid taking responsibility for my ac tions, by falling asleep.\" That of course was his \"basic Freud 101\" speaking, which was wrong. That was clearly a fraudule nt, spook-designed \"diagnosis\" which was intended to make me think it was all \"my fault\". They pretended not to know about the belladonna, but my medical record would be in the inve stigative file in such a case. It 118"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"may turn out in the future that the eviden ce of the belladonna prescription was obliterat ed from my records. After all, they had covered their tracks very well up to that point, so wh y not? The fact that they had gone to such extr emes of bogus ps ychology, and of using high-ranking liars, to avoid MY discovery of THEIR responsibility for causing my narc olepsy, and all th e other so-called \"discipline problems\" I had, desp ite the obvious fact that similar problems would continue so long as I remained in the Air Force, showed that they had no concern for my human rights, and were willing to go to any extrem es to achieve their ends. Commander Thomas Hayward came to Keesler and went with Eddie and me to our squadron mess hall for our Thanksgiving dinner, in 1956, which was on the early date of Nov. 15, because Nov. 1 had fallen on a Thursday . He was warm and friendly, a decorated Navy hero in WW II, who had been awarded the Navy Cross for having remo ved a hot shell casing from a large naval gun on a battleship, which was jammed in the breech, during a battle in the South Pacific. By removing the shell with his bare arms, burning them, in order to get the big gu n back into operation, he had purportedly risked life and limb , \"above and beyond the call of duty\". He made a favorable impres sion on me, as re flected in my book, Pentagon Alie ns, since, at the time of its writing, I had not yet become aware of his duplicity and betrayal of my trust. Tom knew all about my discovery of the KG B cell, down to the last detail. He said he had come to \"help\" me. He told me that he believed that my probl ems were \"being caus ed by the KGB\". His younger brother, Eddie, had been with me ever since basic training and the Lackland Bugle Co rps, in which I was fi rst bugler. I had left Lackland with an \"excellent\" rating. There was no sign of narcolepsy there, or anywhere else before my enlistment. In the GCA school, I had been one of about thr ee top students who vied for the top scores. My grades were later falsified to make me look like a poor student, and to justify my removal from the school for \"sleeping in class\", \"imp roper attitude\", and \"insufficient grades.\" Later, I would receive an FAA certificate by mail, which 119"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"had the proper grades I had made on the wr itten tests for Control Tower Operator, and they were go od grades, quite at odds with those shown in my records. I gue ss the conspirators missed that one. The label \"improper attitude\" was due to the fact , even when threatened and coerced while I wa s under the effects of the drug, that I still wouldn't \"admit\" th at I was willfully falling asleep, because I knew that I had gotten pl enty of sleep, had never had the problem before, and had exerted ev ery bit of will-power I could muster, in effort to st ay awake, to no avail. Eddie had seen me go from a top student and airman, to a broken and dejected, stupefied wa sh-out, who was the victim of poisoning and drug-induced na rcolepsy, which was permanent. I appreciated what ap peared to be genuin e support from Tom, though I didn't quite understand hi s reasoning regarding the KGB being responsible for my sleep at tacks, and hadn't even become aware of the permanent narcolep sy, or connected it to the belladonna, because I was still taking the drug and wa s in \"twilight sleep\" at the time. I hadn't even begun to separate the temporary effects of belladonna ingestion. T hose particularly severe effects were gone after I stoppe d taking it, at which point I then began to distinguish them from the permanent effects of narcolepsy, which I was just learning about and tryi ng to understand, without any technical information regarding the condition. I unsuccessfully tried very ha rd to get the problem under control. Going to bed early in the evening didn't stop or alleviate the problem, or even help it very mu ch, which was a mystery to me, since it had never happened before. I would not connect all of the symptoms of narcolepsy, which I had experienced since October 1956, until I would read an articl e on narcolepsy in Psychology Today in 1977. For the first time in 21 years, I connected all the various classic symptoms of narcol epsy which I had exhibited since October 1956, just after I had begun taking the drug. My first \"hypnogogic hallucinati on\" was while I was napping in my dormitory room, as Eddie Hayward sat in a chair nearby, working on a letter. My friends—E ddie Hayward, Jo seph di Paulo, 120"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"and William Passmore—seemed to f eel sorry for me, to see such a \"sharp guy\" like me go down. Th ey must have thought I had gone crazy or something, or was becoming an alcoholic. I was deceived by Tom Hayward for 44 years. It wasn't until late 2000, when I began to look closely at my old Air Force records, that I began to put it all into focus. Tom had detailed knowledge of the \"classified\" incident, which I ha d initially thought was due to his connection to ONI, but unless he had a \"need to know\", he shouldn't have been given access , or even have known about the incident or been inquisitive about it enough to seek access. His access had to do with carrying out the plan to shut me up, after the Nov. 6th election. It recently became cl ear to me that his purpose was political damage control, after the fact . Covert Air Force intelligence operatives involved in th e Republican plan had tried to murder me, intending to make it look like a suicide or an accidental drug overdose, but I had survived, but was left with a permanent neurological disability. Investigation even of that alone could lead back to the original motive, means and persons involved. That left the problem that I might figure it out, and attempt to get an investigation and possible prosecu tion of the criminals who had given the orders for my elimination, or that I might somehow get the information to the pre ss. That could implicat e the Republican party and maybe even Eisenhow er himself. This wa s \"Proto-Watergate\", and probably involved Vice-Pres ident Nixon, since it had the imprint of his \"M.O.\" I find it very hard to accept th e fact that a man of such high reputation, rank and warm pers onality, such as Tom Hayward, could lend himself to such an evil scheme, to dece ive an innocent 18'year-old boy—who had performe d admirably, by uncovering a nest of KGB records-saboteurs—into believing that \"the Commies\" had caused all his problems. When I reconsidered all the facts, in April 2001, I realized that the or ders for an \"executive action\" (assassination) and cove r-up, required Eisenhow er's authorization. Like Eisenhower, Tom was a loyal Republican. Republicans 121"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"were very strong in th e Navy elite, Tom's forte. After all, hadn't he been a close friends with \"The Little Giant\", Senator John Tower, a former Navy carrier pilot? Hadn't he rose to the rank of Rear Admiral promoted to Chief of Naval Operati ons, under the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan? Was th is his reward for dutifully playing the \"politic al dirty tricks\" game since 1956? Ike or Nixon was apparently fe arful of a political backlash from my discovery that Communis t agents had br azenly sabotaged the Air Force Personnel Center, on their watch, right under the noses of the CIA, Air Force Inte lligence and the FBI, a spy scandal which had secretly come to li ght in the wake of the 1956 presidential election. An 18-year-o ld total amateur, airman 3rd class, had exposed their gross inep titude. If it re ached the public, this could throw the election to the Democrats. That airman 3rd class (me) wasn't covered by a nati onal security secrecy order, so he could talk about what he knew to the press, since he ha d acquired his knowledge of the incide nt through \"innocent means.\" To the President, I was apparently a greater threat than the Communist agents, who were not even prosecuted. The treatment I received was much wo rse than that give n to the Communist agents, who were merely transferre d to the Army, so they could be \"watched more closely.\" I, on the other hand, had been given a \"life sentence\" to the \"prison of narcol epsy\", without a possibility of parole. News of the incident could have influenced the election to be held on Nov. 6th, during which time I was turned into a zombie. The brownie-point-sucking Republic an naval officer, Tom Hayward, was sent to lie to me, to us e his high credentials and winning personality to protect Ike's career, pr obably at the request of Richard Nixon and Genera l Curtis LeMay. It was an ironic turn of events , considered in retrospect. In 1955, Eisenhower had come to Waco , Texas, on the campaign trail. During the parade through downto wn Waco, I watched the parade on T.V. with my grandmother, Nancy Lou Bertha (Richardson) Lyne, in my aunt's hou se, near Guthrie Drive. As the parade ended, 122"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the phone rang, and Gra ndma Lyne answered. In a few minutes, she mysteriously asked me to accomp any her outside. It was a chilly, cloudy and windy day. We walked ou t to a small hillock just outside the rear fence, about 50 yards from the intersec tion of Guthrie Drive and a major highway. A long, black, open-t opped Lincoln lim ousine eased up on the shoulder of the road. President Eisenhower st ood up, faced us, and waved his arm. Grandm a had a little white ha nky, which she waved in the wind, as tears streaked down her cheeks. No one else was present, except Eisenhower, two men in the limousine, my grandma, and I. My boyhood friend's father, the Chief of Secret Service, Charles Warren, Sr., a Southern Cheyenne, was one of the men in the car. Ike and Grandma stood for a moment, viewing one another wistfully across the distance, then Eisenhower slowly sat back down, and the limousine slowly pulled away, as Grandma sobbed quietly into her handkerchief, and we returned to the house. The only possible connection I could make between Grandma and Ike was the fact that she ha d lived in San Antonio with my Aunt Opal, just after my grandfat her's death in 1922, which was the same time that Ike was stationed at Ft. Sam Houston Army Base. My coach in Waco, \"Maj\" William Ki ethly, had been on Ike's staff during WW II, just as my cousin's father-in-law, re tired Air Force Colonel Reinhart had been. Colone l Reinhart had gone to his grave with the belief that the Air Force was incapa ble of corruption, the shining example of a moral for ce for good that he had known in WW II and afterward. Major Kiethly had a high opinion of me. Someone procured a Presidential appointment to the Air Force Academy, from Eisenhower, for me , when I entered the Air Force at age 17, but I couldn 't accept it because I was a high school drop- out. In 1956, Eisenhower had apparent ly ordered my elimination, either that, or someone below him had done the dirty deed, but the motive was to prot ect the White Hous e from the political repercussions of a spy scandal which showed mi litary stupidity under 123"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"a general/president. That may have been considered unforgivable by enough of the American electorate to upset the election results. It was not until late 2000 that I discovered that I had been reassigned to intelligence, while I was still in GCA school, and before I was given the pois on and removed from the school. A few days after Tom' s visit in 1956,1 a ttended a lecture at the base theater, by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, on \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\". Clarke's lecture was based on the li e that flying saucers were not even real, and that all sightings could be explained as mirages, weather anom alies, weird clouds, etc. After the lecture, I approached the podium, filed through a short line, and introduced myself to Clarke with a handshake, saying, \"Dr. Clarke, I' m very pleased to m eet you. I enjoyed your lecture, but both you and I know th at you're a goddamned liar, and that flying saucers are real, man-made flying machines, powered by electricity. I saw one of them up close in 1953, so I know they are real, and you could see the electrical discharg es, so you can't fool me.\" Clarke smiled wryly, as he sh ook my hand, and said that he was glad to meet me also. I knew that Clarke knew the truth, but had been appointed by the British Intelligence Services, the CIA, and the U.S.A.F., to come to Keesler and probably many other American bases, to use his presti ge and speaking sk ills to convince regular Air Force personne l that flying saucers did not even exist. Only the elite knew the truth, ex cept for me. He represented the official, government, \"pseudo-sk eptical\" position in the \"two- pronged attack\", his high creden tials being intended to add credibility to his lies. I wondered what it was like for Clarke to meet an 18-year-old American airman third-class, who wasn't fooled in the least. The fact that he was not angered by my accusation showed that he had a reserved appreciation for my ra tionality, and was not insulted by the truth.

This caused a permanent, neurological disorde r, which made me unfit for \"military intelligence\" (excuse the oxymoroni c expression) work, because I had no treatment or medication what soever for the di sorder at the time. I was viciously and tortuously kicked out of the GCA school I was in, was demoted, given an Article 15 as disciplinary punishment, fined, dishonored, and placed on demeaning details as further punishment. After havi ng done that, the Air Force transferred me to Lockbourne AF B, Ohio, gave me a Top Secret Clearance in an effort to shut me up, and bur ied me in an obscure SAC intelligence office, as an inte lligence clerk. Th ere, still without medical treatment, the same vicious punishment was continued until the time of my discharge, all because of the uncontrollable symptoms I suffered from their poisoning of me. The reason for all this cruel treatment was pure politics. Specifically, the 1956 Eisenhower Re-election Committee, the Republican Party, and Dwight Eisenhower feared that my discovery, if made known to the public, could throw the election to the Democrats. Maybe this came from Nixon, well-known for his underhanded tactics, I would say. I had uncovered a KGB operation which had sabotaged the nerve cente r of the entire Air Force. The KGB agents were responsible for th e sabotage of th e records of, and potential mis-assignment of ever yone coming into the Air Force during their time in operation ...many thousands of personnel.

At the very minimum, I had saved the Air Force many millions—possibly billions—of dollars, and probably many lives and aircraft , and for all that, I was cruelly and viciously punished.

My health will suffer to the end of my life for what the Air Force did to me, and I'm lucky to be alive. Apparently, no one was thankful for what I did. In fact, they were terrified of the truth and what it mi ght do to their future. Imagine the Republicans—Vice-Pr esident Nixon, President Eisenhower, and right-wing General LeMay—reacting to that. They wanted no public prosecution or pr ess releases on it , even though it was bigger than the Rudo lf Abel arrest, the Al drich Ames arrest, or the Richard Hanssen arre st, because the damage involved thousands of personnel, all under the administ ration of Genera l Dwight David Eisenhower, himself a military ma n, whose political career was jeopardized by my di scovery. The political im plications of public knowledge would have been deva stating. How could Eisenhower have let that happen? The best wa y to describe the incident is \"POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT\". And I was the unfortunate messenger...who was shot. Instead of prosecuting the members of the KGB cell, which would have attracted public attenti on, they were transferred to the Army, and the incident was classifi ed (to keep the press from finding out), but since I ha d no clearance at the time of my discovery, I was not bound by a national security ag reement, so they in effect persecuted me into oblivion instead. I was transferred to a SAC base in Ohio—Lockborne AF B—which was directly under the authority of the trusted right-wing head of the Strategic Air Command, General Curtis LeMay, where I c ould be oppressed and controlled. There was no interest in doing what was right or just , but rather to pursue partisan political expediency, through a criminal conspiracy, in service to continued political control by the current Republican administration in Washington. This was clearly a case of trea son, since the Republican Party 126"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"gave \"aid and comfort to the en emies of the Unite d States\", for purely partisan political purposes. The indelible imprint the in cident had ma de upon me, has been inescapably driven home to me, each and ever y day and night since then, by the sympto ms of narcolepsy wh ich I have struggled with ever since. Through the first few years, I neve r came to grips with the problem as a di sability, beca use I was in deni al. So long as I could be involved in dynamic physi cal activity, in my youth, I was able to continue to perform on an acceptable level, by exercising extraordinary concentration. Whenev er I had to sit in a class for a long time, which was so mewhat boring, or when I had not had a lot of sleep the night before, th e problem persisted. For 16 years—between 1962 and 1978—be fore I began getting regular medication, I drove vehi cles which had beds in the back, so I could take a nap whenever the narcolepsy hit me while driving. In late 1977, I first began get ting regular medication. Back in early March, 1962, I entered training for the U.S. Peace Corps, and was sent to Puerto Rico for training. This was the site of the second incident i nvolving the CIA and the spooks, in which I was booted out of Peace Corps training for what I later discovered—over four years later—was the false allegation made by the CIA itself, to President John F. Kennedy, that I was one of its agents. Again, I as the messenge r, was 'shot'. The lie to Kennedy appeared to have been related to an incident involving my discovery, around April, 1962, that the Russian s were installing ICBM silos and missiles in Cuba. I had disc overed this while in Peace Corps training, near Arecibo, Puerto Ri co, when I was a pproached at a rural cantina by an old Puerto Ri can man. The man explained that he had been going back and forth to Cuba in his boat, running a small black-marketeering and smuggl ing operation between Puerto Rico and Cuba. He emerged from a nearby pier, approached me, and excitedly told me what he had seen in Cuba, as he had crawled up in the grass, near an installation near Havana. He described the presence of Russian troops, and the large-scale construction of what were apparently ICBM silos, comp lete with missil es, and batteries 127"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"of anti-aircraft surface-to-air (\"SAM\" ) missiles, to protect against air attacks or U-2 surveillance. The man had then urge ntly made the 1200-mile trip in his boat back to Arecibo as fast as he could, in order to report this important information. I immediately relayed this in formation to four men and a woman whom I knew to be CIA agents, who were in my Peace Corps training group, so it could be checked out. I expected a U-2 flight to be conducted as soon as possible, to get positive photo- confirmation of this strategic inform ation. History shows this to be true, although the version told to the public contains several lies. Two of the CIA agents leaked the misinformation that I was a CIA agent to Fidel Castro's agen ts, when they visited the Peace Corps training base , followed by Castro's ra dio broadcasts accusing the U.S. of planting its CIA agen ts in the Peace Corps. This was done because the CIA and the Repub lican party wanted to make a shambles out of Kennedy's Peace Corps, which they had already infiltrated. After Kenned y had taken the bait, he signed an executive edict which stated that no person who had been in the CIA could be in the Peace Corps. The CIA, through Kennedy's gullibility, scapegoated me and several othe r innocent parties—none of whom were CIA agents—by ki cking us out for bei ng \"CIA agents\", yet failing to tell any of us wh y we were being kicked out. Meanwhile, none of the four re al agents was kicked out, and the CIA illegally main tained its presence in the Peace Corps in defiance to Kennedy's edict. Th eir hatred of Kennedy was apparently greater than their resp ect for the rule of law and the constitution under which our republic is supposed to operate. Just before my depart ure from the Peace Co rps training facility at Barranquitas, Puerto Rico—I was seen off by a sizeable contingency of my Puerto Rican friends—who carried placards protesting my being thrown out—and with a tearful Hispanic girl from Laredo, Texas, in the backgr ound, afraid to co me forward to kiss me goodbye. Meanwhile, the CIA agents had given me a bunch of muck on the Peace Co rps, which they apparently expected me to give to the press on my return to West Texas, where they had 128"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"already arranged for interv iews and a TV appearance. As later documented, and faithfully reflected in the recent movie, \"Thirteen Days\", the info rmation on the Russian ICBMs did not reach the Presiden t for at least six more months, and the President was also falsely led to believe that the ICBMs—which the old man had described to me in April—were not being installed in Cuba until late October, 1962. Neither President Kennedy nor the movie writers apparently ever knew of this lie. The possible reasons the CIA withheld this information from Kennedy for so long are all bad: (1) The CIA, in it s incompetence, may have ignored the information I gave them, dismissi ng it as a rumor, until it because so painfully apparent that they couldn't ignore it; or, (2) the CIA may have wanted to \"cut Kennedy short\"....to make it a \"big surprise\", so th ey could evoke the most extreme reaction from Kennedy, possibly ev en to create a nuclear war. In view of the previous disc overy I had made in 1956, the CIA should have realized that the information I gave them was valid, and I'm relatively certain they acted upon it and had U-2 confirmation on it for six months be fore they told Kennedy about it, and General LeMay made certain Kennedy didn't know about it. The other lie—that I was a CIA agent—was not disclosed to me until a 1966 meeting with a CIA recruiter at the University of Texas at Austin. Incredibly, after trying to murder me and causing my narcolepsy in 1956, and scape goating me in 1962, the CIA attempted to recruit me in 1966, 1974, 1975, 1977 and 1989, in various capacities. Though I have never worked for them, in 1962 they told President Kenne dy that I did. It just goes to show that even the President can be lied to with impunity by the CIA. It was a turning point...an \"e piphany\" if you will...for me, when I read in October, 1962, that the President had just \"discovered\" the Russian plot to install ICBMs in Cuba, which I had discovered and reported to the CIA six months earlier. Meanwhile, though I was still in the dark at th at time as to why I was kicked out 129"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"of the Peace Corps, I knew that the military and the CIA were concealing strategic information from the President, their boss, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. ar med forces. If the President was being denied such critical, nationa l security information, I asked myself, how was he suppos ed to insure our prot ection? Wasn't that treason? Did the ge nerals and spooks care so little for us that they were willing to risk our suffering the possib le consequences of a nuclear holocaust, by denying intel ligence to the President until it was almost too late to avoid a nuclear war? In a Feb. 11, 2001 press inte rview on the arrest of FBI agent/alleged Russian mole Richard Hanssen, President George W. Bush said, \"I just want everyone out there to know that, if you've been false to a trust...if you've betrayed a trust...we're gonna come after you.\" I asked myself, what if th e government is false to a trust? The government had been false to its trust to me so many times...in 1956, by gi ving me a potentially lethal dose of a neurotoxic drug which caused perman ent damage, and in 1962 by falsely scapegoating me as a \"CIA agent\", while lying to President Kennedy, and by shooti ng at my wife in 1983 and causing the miscarriage of our first child, a gi rl, and almost causing my wife to die. After all that, I view wh at it says mostly as lies. As I see it, the \"cloak and dagger\" intrigues provide too many opportunities for illegal political manipulation, as the tools of the evil conspirators who create them. In stead of protecting our national security, they endanger it even more. In addition, a climate of hatred toward Americans has been created, so that we cannot travel abroad without being suspected of working for the spooks. After the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, it became obvious that the CIA and FBI ar e incompetent, that the White House gave the Afgh ani Taliban 43 million dollars only three months before, and that the CIA trained Osama bi n Laden via the Pakistani ISI (intelligence se rvice), probably including the techniques of trauma-based mind- control to use on his suicide stooges. 130"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The CIA's UFOlogy Double-Whammy I had realized much earlier in life that the CIA (through its predecessors) had created both Project Bluebook and the UFOlogy field, to conceal UFO propulsi on technology from the people. My contact with intelligen ce agencies, aside from confirming my earlier suspicions, had done little more th an tell me what they were supposed to do, and revealed what they had failed to do, when under a duty to do so. It taught me to look for the motivations behind the various CIA frauds and failures in respect to the American people, and many others in the world, who don't deserv e such abuse. Since I realize that all the major governments of the world possess UFO technology, yet keep it secret, such secrecy in the name of \"national security\" is the bigges t fraud of all, especi ally when the technology could liberate our citize ns from energy slavery. We know of government frauds on ly because of blunders by its employees, but such \"blunders\" can be faked. A prime example of a faked government blunder is re vealed by the circumstances surrounding the C ondon Report, in which a government plan to use \"non-believers\" to propa gate false propaganda was intentionally exposed, due to a feigned \"accidental \" discovery of a \"secret\" memo, dated Aug. 9, 1966, wr itten by Robert Low, project \"coordinator\". In October, 1966, the Air Force selected Dr. Edward U. Condon of the Univers ity of Colorado in Boulder to head a committee to do an allegedly \"obj ective, scientific study\" of the UFO phenomenon. Low's \"secret\" me mo was \"inadvertently\" placed into the unclassified \"open file s folder\" under the heading, AIR FORCE CONTRACT AND BACKGROUND, so it could be \"discovered\" by a researcher for NICAP, Maj. Donald Kehoe's UFO (CIA front) organization. The memo 1 stated, in pertinent part (emphasis mine), as follows: 1 from Flying Saucer Fiasco, John G.

One wa y to do this would be to stress investigation, not of the physical phenomena, hut rather of the people who do the observing—the psycholog y and sociolosy of persons and groups who report seeing UFO's.

For maximum effect, it was made to appear painfully clear from the memo that the purpose of the co mmittee was to create the false illusion of scientific objectivity, and to convi nce the public of the \"non-existence\" of UFOs. Therefore, the rationale for th e alleged study was to make it appear to be focused on the personal psychol ogy and sociological aspects of witnesses and UFO group s, to inflame their indignation, while conspicuously a voiding the physical rea lity of UFOs or the technology observed by w itnesses. This was similar to Project Bluebook, which was to ostensibly po se as the offici al depos itory of 132"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the public's UFO sightings and p hotos, in order to \"study\" and \"understand\" the UFO \"phenomenon\", but having as its ulterior purpose the collection and conceal ment of objective reports by rational witnesses, and photo graphs which revealed the government's classified UFOs.

Meanwhile, the huckters of the Condon Committee were conspicuously set up as red herrings, to fabricate the false appearance of a \"government cover-up of government-alien contact\". It skirted the issue of technology which might appear to some to prove th e existence of \"alien\" UF Os, and changed the focus from technological to psychologi cal and sociological.

Consequently, four of the first five memb ers selected for the Condon Committee were psychologist s, while coordinator Robert Low had an M.B.A., with a B.S. in electrical engineering.

The Condon Committee and Maj. Donald Kehoe's NICAP organization represented two government \"prongs\" which are discussed later in more detail. Meanwhile, by its exclusive, official control over the gathering and con cealment of rational UFO reports, Project Bluebook, headed by J.

NICAP and the Condon Comm ittee's conduct was designed to create a dramatic conflict in tended to polarize and divide the public between one or the other pr ong, leaving absolu tely no \"Most Rational Alternative\" in the \"middle\"...the arena of logic and reason. It was a nice touch to have a member of Kehoe's group 'discover' the allegedly misp laced \"secret\" memo, which was intended to expose the governme nt's \"official\" agenda of manipulating the public. This was so the UFOlogists could scream \"Censorship!\" and was intended to add false credibilit y to the idea of a \"...cover-up of a government -alien liaison.\" \"Major\" Donald Kehoe's military credentials added en hanced credibility to he and his group of counter-huckters: The Quix otic \"fighting marine\", leading his platoon in a battle against insurmountable government secrecy concealing \"alien\" visits.

This also showed that Hynek and Air Force Intelligence were defi nitely involved in spreading the begged question of alien visitations. The closure of Proj ect Bluebook in 1969 repr esented a shift in government strategy, prob ably resulting from th e fact that Bluebook would no longer deter the intellig ence interests of Russia, which clearly had the technology by that time. From that poi nt on, the only remaining \"enemy\" was the public. It is revealing to compare th e prior agenda of Air Force contractors as stated in the leaked Low memo--to deflect the gist of the investigation from physical reality to ps ychological causes or aberrations--to statements by Fren ch UFOlogist, Jacques Vallee, in Passport to Magonia ( 1969), in which he bui lt upon the Swiss psychologist C.G. Jung's \"coll ective unconscious\"/\"archetypal images\"/Tarot card hypothe sis, to depict UFOs as a \"sociological phenomenon\"....\"...manifestations of the collective unconscious\" (an theory on which J ung himself had already reversed his position in respect to UFOs, as disclosed by a newspaper interview given by him while visiting Al amogordo, New Mexico). We can see that the agenda of the CIA/OSI UFOlogists had been boosted by Robert Low's \"s ecret\" memo—which had so conspicuously fallen in to the public's hands through NICAP (as if the government couldn't have re trieved it)—which laid out the \"official prong\" parameters unde r which the Air Force and CIA required the Condon Committee to operate.

Whether by coincidence or intent, the effect was the same as if he were operati ng under the OSI agenda. Since my 1993 first edition of Space Aliens From the Pentagon was published, there have even b een a few in the UFO community who have accused me of being a \"CIA agent\". I can only laugh at this, and my own mild irritation, since, according to my own analysis 135"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"of the UFO situation—extendin g for over 50 years—I should therefore be trying to convince you that UFOs ar e extraterrestrial in origin, or natural or paranorm al phenomena, as covert CIA UFOlogists do, or espousing the \"ali en lizard-people\" \"party line\". Instead, I'm exposing technology th at our government conceals on behalf of the powers that be, to pr otect its cozy partnership with the powerful economic in terests. As Hitler said, \"One hand washes the other.\" My lifelong research shows that UFOs are exclusively man-made electric flying machines, invent ed by Nikola Tesla before 1900. I don't expect anyone who has thei r head screwed on straight to believe that I am a CIA agent, even though Presid ent Kennedy was finally convinced it was true. This was after he questioned the CIA's veracity, by sending his brother-in-l aw, R. Sargent Shriver, to spend a few days hanging around with me in Puerto Rico, to try to determine whether or not the CIA was lying to him about me. Hindsight now shows that he should have heeded th ose suspicions, and rejected the CIA lies. I do not think that I can sue for libel, slander or defamation for being called a CIA agent, and it is doubtful that the government's judges would consider such an accusation damaging or defamatory. Anyone foolish enough to believe I am a CIA agent, after reading my books, is tragically pa thetic, laughabl e and stupid. Even if a person is not a \"card- carrying\" member of the CIA, if that person does the CIA's covert work for it, by spreading what I call the \"pseudo-skeptic\" or \"p seudo-paranormalist\" party line, they are just as much an agent as if they are on the payroll. You could think of them as the \"CIA Auxiliary\". By \"covert work\", I mean someone who surreptitiously does the CIA's work, but conceals or denies employment by, or association with, the CIA. This does not apply to me, since, as a concerned citizen, I only reported what I knew to be st rategic information, which had inadvertently fallen into my lap. Nothing I ever did in this respect was \"for the government\", only \"f or the people\", and I was never paid a red cent for it. 136"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"On the other hand, if a CIA employee were to sabotage the work of the CIA, they could be s ubject to prosecution for sabotaging their \"mission\". As such, if I we re a CIA employee, I could be accused of sabotagi ng the CIA's UFOlogy M.O., by publishing my books, but as a civilian, I am not subject to prosecution, only harassment and suppressi on, sometimes through lawsuits or threats of lawsuits, as well as interferenc e with the distribution of my books, with my speaking engagements, and my radio interviews. For example, on Feb. 19, 2001, I received a call from Art Bell, requesting a telephone interview, wh ich he scheduled for Feb. 20, at 3:00 P.M. On Feb. 20, at 3:00 P.M., the phone service for the entire village of Lamy, New Mexico (where I live) was turned off at the main switchboard in Santa Fe. The service rema ined off until Feb. 21, 1:00 A.M., after Bell's night-time broadcast had begun, too late for me to call. The outage was reported on Feb. 20, but no work crew was dispatched, because the phone comp any knew that nothing was broken and that the governme nt had turned off the service. A phone company representative called the following morning, and acknowledged that th e service had been inte rrupted at the main switchboard. When I asse rted that I thought th e FBI had done it, he stated, \"I am prohibited from expr essing an opini on on that matter.\" That, in effect, confirmed my alle gation, since it showed that a secrecy order was in effect, wh ich the phone company employee was required to obey, probably under the delusion that he was some sort of \"patriot\".

Vallee (if the woman was speaking of the same Jacque s Vallee, as there is 137"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"more than one), did not deserve the possible inferences which a reader might derive from reading Pe ntagon Aliens. I did not mean to imply that Vallee was an employee of the CIA or that he had a hand in stealing my photos. What Vall ee deserves is a more in-depth analysis and critique, in the light of my \"CIA M.O. \" criteria. None of Vallee's personal life is any of my business , but I continue to assert that everything I have said about his work, which is subject to fair criticism, is true to the best of my knowledge. Sometimes Vallee talks like he wa nts to be a skeptic, a la Philip Klass, and sometimes he talks like he believes in aliens or strange beings or forces, and sometimes he even mentions \"advanced secret government aircraft\", but in my books, if someone parrots the paranormal party line, I object, and it doesn't ma tter whatever else they may pay lip service to. In reviewing some of Jacques Vallee's UFOlogy statements through the years, it is obvious that he appears to vacillate between the two sides of what I call the CIA's \"two-pronged attack\" (pseudo- skeptical government denial, and UFOlogical paranormalism, respectively). These two \"prongs\" were designed to trap and crush reason—what I call the third, \"Most Rational Alternative\" (\"MRA\")—in the middle, the asser tion that UFOs are exclusively man-made, and that there are no aliens present on earth. My additional assertion—supported by ob jective evidence and my own personal experiences—is that the CI A initially created and presently controls both sides of the debate —the two \"prongs\" —as well as the entire field of UFOlogy. The CIA seeks to control the \"middle\", anticipating the problems represen ted by my argument when it designed the program—in fact, the \"why\" for its creation of the program. Its total control of the fi eld through its covert, paranormal- UFOlogists, and the conspicuous absence of my argument, prove this. Vallee apparently tries to \"occupy\" the middle also, but doesn't belong there, because, in stead of representing it as the arena of logic and reason which it naturally shoul d be, as I do, he apparently depicts it--by his actions and statements—as an arena of vacillation, 138"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"in which confused or i ndecisive indivi duals are led to believe that the only option is a choice between the two irrationa l \"prongs\", as if the \"MRA\" does not ev en exist.

Logi c is logic, and it can't be dodged even by evasiveness with oneself or others. In early 2001, just after the announcement th at I was to appear as a speaker in Santa Clara, Calif ornia, at a two- day event entitled \"Conspiracy.Con\", I received a le tter from David Alexander, an attorney representing Jacques Vallee, threatening to sue me for libel and defamation, for the statements I purportedly made about Vallee in Pentagon Aliens (t hird, renamed 1999 ed. of Space Aliens From the Pentagon). I had mentioned the name \"Vallee\" tw ice in the same context, and once in the index, so , without admitting guilt, I deleted the name, thereby mooting any cl aim. I also considered that, whatever important things I have to say can be concluded by anyone who reads and understands my books, without reference to a specific name, so it really isn't essentia l to mention any UFOlogist in a specific contex t, though it is often helpful. Since the purpose of my book is to teach my method of analysis and understanding to my readers, so they can analyze UFOlogy for themselves, why not delete a name? After all, why should I allow the threat of a lawsuit to jeopardize my book? I therefore decided to write this chapter, to make myself clearer and to pursue particular issues more succinctly and in great er depth and detail, in regard to the work of Vallee and some others of that ge nre.

It would not only be an unr easonable viola tion of First Amendment rights, but also quite un realistic to expect a court to grant Vallee a \"King's X\", giving him \"royal immunity\" and prohibiting anyone from mentioning, discussing or criticizing his ideas, since he has chosen to stic k himself into the spotlight of scrutiny, and to continue to put in his \"two cen ts\" as the debate rolls along. If he can't stand the heat, he will have to disappear from the kitchen, perhaps in a similar wa y as his witness claimed the USS Eldridge disappeared (as you will read about below). Since he has made himself rather unavoidable, I decided to devote some time and energy to this chapter, to show what kinds of reactions I had to Vallee many years ago, as well as today. By recently demanding my attenti on to his activities, through his threat to sue me—and to ha ve all my books recalled and destroyed—Vallee has induced me to focus on his past, to get a more complete idea of what his work has been all about. It appears to me to be Vallee' s self-appointed \"job\"—or maybe it's just his personal qu irk—to play the devil' s advocate, a position which tends to keep the resolution of UFO/alien issues unresolved, the way he apparently likes it... hazy , nebulous, paranormal, and irrational...occasionally venturing fo rth to attack and \"debunk\" those with rational explanations fo r allegedly paranormal incidents, which leaves standing what I cons ider to be the irrational, CIA UFOlogical paranormalist status quo. He uses what I call \"pseudo- skeptical\" arguments ag ainst those who may offer realistic answers to paranormal-interpreted events, and as such, ambi valently appears to be a supporter of bo th the irrational offici al denials and of the 140 "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"paranormal phenomena...and of th e CIA's M.O., by default. Vallee's conduct is consistent with the government's plan to control both sides of the debate, through its two-pronged attack, which means that the spooks and the government will promote his work, as well as some in the movie industry (i.e., St even Spielberg's Close Encounters of th e Third Kind). These tw o prongs are two sides of the same coin, since both the de nial of the existence of UFOs, and the assertion of the presen ce of \"alien\" UFOs, are equally irrational and \"paranormal\"...a pos ition which I consider to be dishonest...since many thous ands of responsible, experienced aircraft observers with certifia ble 20-20 eyesight—including myself— have seen them. Vallee appears to po lice the \"middle\", which has the effect of clearing out anyone offeri ng rationality to the situation; get rid of the rational, leaving the irra tional, so the tw o-pronged system will continue to work. Whether or not this conduc t by Vallee is by design or by statistically-challenging coincide nce, is a matter of personal judgment, but I do think his work definitely coincides with the CIA's covert program. If Vallee has given this effect unconsciously, he has my sincere pity. If anyone th inks threats to sue will \"clear me out\", they have another think coming. I have no personal animosity to ward Vallee, and If I knew him personally, I would probabl y like him, as he a ppears to be a very intelligent, glib and charming pers on, with creativ ity and a writer's gift. My beef with him has to do with the ideas which he has spread in the past, which I think are damaging to the scientific understanding of UFOs, as well as to the rati onality of the people who swallow his theories. Granted, those who believe what he says are already gullible, but I don't believe it is ethical to feed paranormal pulp to those who are gu llible, and I will do whatever I can to convince them of what I believe to be the Most Rational Alternative. I will argue against paranormal theories until hell freezes over, so to speak, and no one will stop me so long as I am breathing.

Superficially, Vallee's approach may appear to be rational to gullible people, until you look at his weird punch-lines, and tally up the numerous important things he has conspicuously seemed to avoid, ignore, or even appears to conceal. For example, the following article, with the ti tle, Jacques Vallee Hoaxed Science & UFO Community With His \"Anatomy!\" UFO Sweden, sheds some light on Vallee's M.O. with resp ect to other pa ranormalists, when operating in what I call the \"Pseudo-Skeptic\" mode: Vallee and the Fraud Business The controversy I discuss here was initially kicked up by various writers and alleged witnesses, surrounding the alleged \"Philadelphia Experiment\". I ta ke no position on this alleged experiment—which I have no way of knowing actually occurred, and apparently neither does anyone else—since all information appears to be hearsay. But I do know that many frauds have been associated with the gov ernment's covert program to promulgate false stories surrounding it. I offer this information to show Vallee's involvement, according to a pa per which I found on the Internet 3 . The Navy most certainly conduc ted some experiments related to German WW II submarine warfare , and in fact, also conducted some research related to Germ an WW I submar ine warfare, intended to develop and test technology to avoid German torpedoes, and for American sub-chasers to find German U- boats—such as sonar—so they could be sunk with depth charge s. The idea that any so-called \"invisibility\" experiments were related to making American ships invisible to radar, or invi sible to German magnetic torpedo sensors, seems more credible, a nd such technology was developed 3 TRUE.X-FILES.NEWS, An Internet News Service/true.x-fiIe.netw@2ne ws.com, found by me on Jan. 11, 2001. 142"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"for our ships and submarines, but neither of these experiments or tests appears to have been compet ently proven insofa r as the place and time they were performed, sp ecifically linked to the alleged Philadelphia scenario.

Eldridge invisi ble to radar, rather than invisible to the eye—of fraud. Vallee based this rather rash allegation on the idea that the Germans did not have radar in 1943, ignoring the probability that the Navy might have done such an experiment in anticipation of the time when the Germans would develop radar, had it not been for the documented fact—available to Vallee via Navy documents—that the Germans did have rada r in 1941- This was tw o years prior to the alleged experiment , though there is no proof that they ha d outfitted their subs with it by 1943. In any case, this was no t an essential element to the Navy's possible te sts. Ironically, I entertained the \"invisibility-to-radar\" postulate in Pentagon Aliens, and Vallee is reported to have suggested the sa me possibility. Was this before or after he read my book? The absence of German radar wo uld have been a slim enough basis for alleging \"fraud\", even if true, and a rather drastic and defamatory allegation under the circum stances, yet what is at stake if a reasonable explanation for the alleged \"Philadelphia Experiment\" is allowed to prevail? It would discredit the obviously phony paranormal and ridiculous ta le about the experiment being an attempt to make the El dridge invisible to th e eye, but which went wrong, causing the ship and its crew to get caught up in a so-called \"space'time warp\", resulting in its be ing transported to another time and place; or, the st ory about it becoming invisible to the eye.

In his attack on the reasonable e xplanation, it appeared that Vallee attempted to show that the proponents of the alternate theory had concealed their presumed knowledge of appropriate Navy documents which allegedly show ed that the Germans had no operational radar in 1943. By his same standard, Vallee was also presumed to be aware of the Na vy documents which proved that what he and his witness said was wr ong, and put most or all of what they said into question. After ValleVs paper was publish ed, allegedly to \"debunk\" the alternate theory, \"Special Civili an Investigator\" Marshall Barnes responded, saying that Vallee had a presumed knowledge of Navy documents which proved that the Germans in fact had radar in 1941, two years before the alleged experiment . While this did not prove that the Germans had rada r on their subs, the Navy would have been very short- sighted not to assume that the Germans soon would install radar on their subs, and would mo st likely have been held to blame for a failure to conduct experiments which might avoid the loss of several ships and many live s, a result which, if ameliorated by productive experiments, could more than pay for experiments which might have help ed to develop appropriate new technology. In his initial paper, Vallee’s alleged \"e ye-witness\", Edward Dudgeon, said he was present at the stated time, and that the Philadelphia experiment, per se, \"n ever occurred\", but added that the ship did in fact beco me invisible to the eye, due to the effects of \"St. Elmo's fire\".

After being confronted with the evidence, Barnes asserted that Vallee did not retract his article, and by his subsequent conduct continued to promulgate his \"debu nking\" paper, by his failure to disapprove of his witness's allege d fraud.

J. Allen Hynek in his work for Project Bluebook, the Air Force/ OSI project created allegedly to investigate the so-called \"UFO phenomenon\". My documentation shows that the Nazis came in to possession of Tesla's UFO technology and did init ial experimentation at Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1934-38, prior to taking the technology to Germany. The U.S. came into possession of th e German projects in 1945, under Operation Paperclip. Documentation shows that Project Bluebook was initially created on contract for the U. S. Army Air Force Counter- intelligence Co rps (\"C.I.C\") at Wrig ht-Patterson AFB Ohio, beginning during WW II, by Char les Hundley and Edgar Cayce. Cayce was employed there ostens ibly as a \"technical writer\". Hundley was associated with the O.N.I., having taught Russian to American Naval Intelligence officers . The project later fell under the jurisdiction of the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (\"OSI\"), but was covertly organized under the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence (A.K.A. \"OSI\", confusion intentional). The last time I heard from Hundley, around 1961, he was teaching maritime law at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy at Carlsbad, California. Hundley had also been associated with the Ohio State University astronomy de partment, and said he was also associated with Jacques Vallee, due to the Bluebook connection. In spite of his \"high credentials\", Hundley made many paranormal claims, such as, \"...being abducted by Venusians and taken to Venus and back in a flying saucer.\" Sinc e I could write a small book about all this, I won't digress further here. His reasons for making such claims should be obviou s to those who read my book, especially in view of his inte lligence background. An alleged CIA source told Timo thy Good (as reported in his book, Above Top Secret, 1988) that in 1955, the leaders of the secret services of the USSR, USA, France and Britain met at Geneva and unanimously agreed to a policy of secrecy on the \"UFO problem\" as 146"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"far as the public was concerned. Good also said that Vallee told him in 1986 that in 1966, he was sent to the International Congress of Mathematics in Moscow, and mana ged to discuss the subject of UFOs with several Soviet scientis ts. Good also st ated that an unevaluated CIA report, dated 18 Au g. 1967 (a few months after Vallee's trip), with the subject heading , \"Report on Conversations with Soviet Scientists on Subject of Unidentified Flying Objects in the USSR\", had the name of the CIA (or CIA'Sponsored) scientist who conducted the inte rview, along with the names of the Soviet scientists, deleted, t ogether with the date(s) of the interviews. From this sequence of events, it is reasonable to suspect that Vallee or any other sc ientist accompanying hi m, might have been the \"CIA or CIA-sponsored\" sc ientist who conducted the 1966 interviews mentioned in the 1967 report. The ultimate purpose of U.S. UF Ological forays into Russia in ca. 1966 appeared to have been to monitor Russian government compliance with its agr eement to keep its UFO reports secret, under the 1955 Geneva agreement. It is also interes ting to note here that there has been a conspicuous absence of any claim by any government that the utterance of a paranormal claim is a security breach, so these claims can be pres umed to be both unclassified and untrue. Since it is illegal under our co nstitution for an American citizen to nego tiate directly with or to serve a foreign government without executive au thority, especially its m ilitary or its scientists, and especially when that governme nt is considered hostile to the U.S. at the time, we should su spect that ValleVs work on the Russian trip was authorized by the national security apparatus of the U.S. government. It would probably also require Vallee to disclose to them the context of all his contacts with Soviet scientists after his return, just as Los Alamos Na tional Laboratory required of its employee, scientist Wen Ho Lee, on his return to the U.S. from a similar mathematics conference in Communist China, as disclosed during the prosecution of Lee in 1999-2000.

Since the official polic y of the U.S. government toward UFO reports is secrecy, we can as sume that Vallee's discussions of UFOs with Soviet scientists was of an authorized, \"government-to- government\" nature. It can also be presumed that the \"un-secret\" (\"public\") reports of Project Blue book, and of its former employee, Vallee, are all suspect, either co mpletely concocted by the CIA/OSI, to maintain secr ecy through misinformation, or carefully selected reports which favor a hazy, nondescript, \"mi ddle\" paranormalist interpretation. The ambiguous interpretations advocated by Vallee, have the effect of dumbing down the public, and of supporting the official denials of CSICOP and Phillip Kl ass, on the one hand, or the paranormal interpretations of Vall ee on the other—or of supporting the similarly outrageous \"space alien\" claims of the slightly more extreme lunatic fringe—allowing them to prevail among various segments of the populati on. Naturally, the tota l effect of all these \"fuzzy\" effects is a sort of factua l mud. Was Vallee's work promoted by the CIA through its contacts in the media and publishing, because his theories favored its two-pronged strategy?

Th is is especially true where the alleged event or thing is a known government secret, and the information comes from a government source. Everything that Vallee says in regard to alleged \"aliens\" or UFOs, is entirely consistent with my analysis. So wh at does he say? Vallee says he thinks UFOs ar e the \"modern manifestation of an age-old phenomenon\", generally what he calls the \"paraphysical theory of UFO or igins\" (Parascope ,Inc, 1996). This theory includes the time-travel hypothesis—UFOs as time machines from our own future—and the angel/demon theory —UFOs as God's angels or Satan's demons—taken to be \"visit ors from space\". I had to laugh when I heard the Satan's demons hypothesis; imagine, Satan having his own little air force, and God too! In Forbidden Science, Vallee stated that UFOs are probably \". ..windows to other dimensions...\", \"...manipulated by intelligent, ofte n mischievous, always enigmatic beings we have yet to understand\" (60 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time). Philip Klass, CIA man and CSICOP director, whom I call the government's lead \"pseudo-debunker\", calls Vallee \"...one of the more distinguished members of th e pro-UFO commun ity\"....\"one of the brighter physical scientists who believes in UFOs\" (Heretics Among Heretics\", 60 Grea test Conspiracies of All Time, interview). So here Vallee is praised by the arch pseudo-debunker himself. Vallee believes that \"...the intell igence guiding UFOs is a kind of control mechanism, an invisible hand shaping the development of human consciousness over a period of eons..\" (60 GCAT). He tried to cover his rear by acknowledging that gover nments \"..sometimes 150"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"manipulate public opinion through UFO mythology, sometimes constructing elaborate hoaxes for propagandistic purposes.\" This could be said of him, couldn't it? This s ounds like a quote from my books. If Vallee si ncerely believes this, why hasn't he written about it more? Vallee says \"...we don't know\" where UFOs come from, that they are possibly a \" ...natural phenomenon\", or \"...an undiscovered form or energy in the atmosphere..\" , possibly \"artific ial\", and if so, \"...it could come from another form of consciousness, which may or may not be extraterrestrial.\" In other words, Vallee wants it a multiplicity of ways, except as a real, man-made flying machine powered by electricity. Fuzzy, so- called \"declassified\" or \"unclassifie d\" photos are chos en to support this theory, because th ey are hazy, nebulous, a nd vague, nothing like the saucer I saw on a clear, end-o f-summer day, from about 300 feet, in 1953, and nothing like the phot os and negatives the OSI purchased from my boyhood friend. Incidentally, photos of real saucers may a ppear to be hazy, because of their rapid precession dur ing certain flight modes, as I describe in Pent agon Aliens. This is especially th e case where the lens or film speed is too slow to catch th e image in a \"still\" photo. One of the first stat ements I make in Pentagon Aliens, is: \"Have neither an open nor clos ed mind, but rather a self- controlled mind, which we ighs facts, accepts tr uth and knowledge, and filters out lies and trash.\" This reflects my disgust with such bromides as the one I saw on a bumper sticker: \"Minds are like parachutes; they only work when open.\" The sa me thing applies to a toile t, but a toilet is for the disposal of human excrement, not an input port for valuable knowledge.

History will eventually undo them, showing th em to be intellectual thieves. It is often said that \"an idea cannot be patented\". There is something wrong with that , but even if true unde r the law, it is still intellectually dishonest to claim th e discovery of someone else's idea in a patent application, without th e slightest attribut ion, when it is known that priority was with the victim of that theft. Scientists like Michael Farada y and many of his colleagues wouldn't have thought of taking the ideas of others, wit hout saying where they got them. The \"rush to the patent office\" to claim such unpatented discoveries made by others is not only illegal, but unethical, because such applications require the swearing of an oath declaring that the claimant knows of no priority by anyone. Relativism does not recognize free-energy, ether, ZPR or electromagnetic radiati on which travels through space. Their theory was based on \"corpuscular photons\", whic h required no luminiferous ether to transpor t their force through space. The concept of the \"photon\" implie s a \"light particle\", not electromagnetic wave radiation, because without an ether, there would be nothing for a wave to \"wave\" (wave action requires a \"medium\" to wave, similar to a wave on a pond of water). Relativists hang out on the In ternet constantly, looking for ideas to steal and claim as their own. Why? Because Relativism does not produce any results, will sa botage your brain and cripple your creativity and reason. Those who practice this religion spend all their time praying at the Holy Shri ne of Einstein, but their 'god' gives them nothing. Was it all Einstein's sick joke on them? Relativism recognizes no \"quantum vacuum field\" or ether in \"empty space\". Einstein's theory of gravity was wr ong, because he believed in no ether. So the Relativ ists invented a \"quantum vacuum field\" with \"fluctuations\" (i.e., osc illations), in contradiction to their religion.

Consequently, they never measured it directly, only extrapolated it retroactively as \"equal\", base d on this erroneous theory. I found a reference from a reput able source which gave the dissociation energy as 103 cal/gram mole 1 , rather than the 109 k- cal/gram mole of the Rela tivists. I preferred that figure, since it was published by a major house, and ha d gone through five editions without challenge. It differed from the \"norm\", which was controlled by Relativist theory. Ma ybe, I thought, Van Nostrand was independent, since they had published some Te sla books in the early 20 th century, after Relativi sm had begun to take over. It is also said by Re lativist theory that all that is required to dissociate diatomic hydrogen to monoatomic hydrogen, is heat energy, which is supposed to be equal \"exactly\" to the recombination energy. This disso ciation/recombination energy is also supposed to be equal to the \"bond energy\" which has been broken by heat, which is then supposed to be stored in the monoatomic hydrogen atoms until re leased again in recombination, whereupon the broken bonds are \"r estored\". This would have to mean that the bond ener gy of a diatomic molecu le would have to be equal to the energy \"stored\" in the monoatomic atoms, minus the energy released by recombination. My hypothesis was that the dissociation energy required to separate the diatomic atoms could not be greater th an the energy of combustion of H 2 with oxygen, which produces H 2 O, with a bond which is supposed to be stronger, due to the electromotive difference between oxygen and hydro gen. Using the Relati vists' own standard, this means that the energy of dissociation/reco mbination of hydrogen is 3.76 times that for hydrogen hydrol ysis/combustion. This is yet another internal c ontradiction in Relativist theory. According to Langmuir, atomic hydrogen is produced directly in hydrolysis using a l ead amalgam cathode. Ye t, since Langmuir was a Relativist, he neve r measured it direct ly, but computed the 1 Encyclopedia of Science, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company (1976), fifth edition 161"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"dissociation energy backward on paper as the same as the recombination energy, assuming that the elect rical wattage required to produce a gram mole of at omic hydrogen was equal to the recombination energy per gram mole of monoatomic hydrogen. If the energy requ ired to break the diat omic bonds is supposed to be equal to the 'stored' heat in dissociated atoms, and the bonds are 'restored' when the atoms r ecombine, the 'bonds' would still have to contain the same energy as that which had already been released during the 'restoration', according to Relativism. Either the diatomic bond ener gy is \"replaced\" by heat on dissociation, and converted back to heat on recombination—and therefore taken away—or the heat stored \"in\" the mono atomic atoms only dissociates the atoms when it places enough strain on the bonds to break them. Sinc e the bonds are restored when the heat is released, the force main taining the bonds is neit her heat nor another force converted from he at, but would still have to exist somewhere. My theory is that IR radiation (\"heat\") can be stored in the space between nuclei and elect ron clouds, as well as in intermolecular space, when disso ciation occurs. The radiation remains in its original electromagnetic wave form as it bounces around inside, 'force free', reflected between the nuclei and electron clouds. Since IR radiation is of lower frequency and voltage than UV radiation, it lacks sufficient penetrating power or force to break out of this space until the recombination of the monoatomic atoms, at which time it is able to exit when the electron clouds open up, as the new diatomic electrostatic bonds re-attach. I think the \"bonds\" are electrosta tic ones, which can be broken by heat, by expanding or stressi ng the space between nuclei and electron clouds to the bonds ' elastic limits, or by other radiation, or by electrostatic force. This is me rely mechanical. A more efficient means of breaking the b onds should be by elect rostatics. Even more effectively, they shoul d be broken more easily by higher frequency radiation, such as UV. In addition, UV radiation transmutes hydrogen and ail other elements below atomic number 19. This should yield additional en ergy on reversal.

This violates Relativism, re presenting sub-electron charges. If electrostatics ca n break the bonds, the proper \"arc\" should be an electrostatic one, rather than a conventional AC or DC arc current, usually used to dissociate atomic hydrogen. Since it is also recognized that the process by or dinary arc discharge/heat is incomplete, perhaps electrostatics ca n also make it more complete. The dissociation of hydrogen by heat appears to be a mechanical one, related to the ki netic energy of the heat-induced increase in vibrations of the di atomic nuclei and electrons, caused by IR radiation. That being the case , it should also be subject to the rule that the electroma gnetic interaction is 10 40 times greater than the gravitational one. 2 This should therefore be related to the hydrogen nucleus' gravitational mass, versus the use of electrostatic force to break th e bonds more efficiently, since the electromagnetic interaction should do more work on the nucleus during the same time, and should theref ore improve the process. Langmuir first noticed the atomic hydrogen reaction after hydrogen gas was pa ssed around heated tungs ten wires, believing that heat transferred to the hy drogen broke the bonds. However, tungsten may react electrostatically or cata lytically to break the diatomic bonds. This 1912 experiment was originally done in Socorro, New Mexico, in a dese rt well-known for its high electrostatic activity. In this region it is ve ry difficult to avoid electrostatic charges.

He played solo baritone horn in Waco High School Band, Texas' best high schoo l band, in 1956, led by the immortal Lyle Skinner, in its 25 th consecutive Dist. IV-A Texas Sweepstakes victory performance, and won a gold medal for his solo. In 1956, Lyne entered th e Air Force. He was removed from an Air Traffic Control School (GCA), placed in Air For ce Intelligence, and granted a Top Secret Clearance, which, unknown to him at th e time, was primarily to prevent his public disclosure of a Soviet spy ring he had discovered at the age of 18, while in basic training at Lackland AFB, Texas. In 1965, Lyne acquired a B.S., with a double major (Fine Arts and Industrial Arts), Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas. In 1969, he acquired an MFA in Studio Arts from the University of Texas. When he arrived in New Mexico in 1970, he was a professiona l artist (painting and sculpture), a profession abandoned years ago due to co nstant harassment orchestrated by the CIA (he refused an executive position they offered him). Lyne has lived in New Mexico for the past thirty-one years, where he engages in energy R & D, writes, publishes, and pursues very broad interests, ranging from art to music, cinema, ac ting, photography, science, epigraphy and petroglyphs, archaeology, ancient history, geography, inventing, interpretation of current events and enjoying the beautiful Southwestern scenery and culture.
