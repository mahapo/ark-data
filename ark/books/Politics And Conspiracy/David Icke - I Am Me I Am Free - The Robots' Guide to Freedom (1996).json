What lies behind those eyes? When youlook in the mirror, what do you see? Do you see the real you, or whatyou have been conditioned to believe is you? The two are so, so,different. One is an infinite consciousness capable of being and creatingwhatever it chooses, the other is an illusion imprisoned by its ownperceived and programmed limitations.Which of these “yous” is controlling your life? Infinity or limitation?Self love or self disdain? Freedom of thought or a prison of the mind?Sadly for the overwhelming majority of people on this planet all butthe privileged few - it is the conditioned mind which prevails. Theylive their lives within their programmed limitations of thought, view,and action. It is a world of I can’ts and I daren’ts and I mustn’ts; of Ishoulds and I musts and I ought tos; a world of conforming to whatsomeone else says they must be or should be. While the real them seesonly solutions and opportunities to learn and evolve, the programmedthem sees only problems and reasons not to do. They live life behindbars in a cell of their own making. The world itself reflects the sumtotal of these billions of individual prisons. The Earth has become aglobal Alcatraz, a spinning ball of control and imposition dictated bythe few at the expense of the many. Freedom? Free-what? How do youspell that again? The human race has not been free for a very, verylong time, well before recorded history. But the trick is to persuade usthat we are free - then we won’t do anything about the walls thatsurround us and the warders at the door. Walls? What walls? You’refree! Warders? What warders? You’re free!Yes you are free: you are free to watch television - thirty channelsand more of mindless crap which close down your sense of infinityand fred you illusions of what you should do, be and think. You havethe freedom to press the zappa button and choose any one of them."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2Oh what a joy to live in the land of freedom. You are free to watch thenews and see journalists and correspondents telling you, mostly withoutquestion, the official explanation of events - explanations designed toensure that you see the world in the desired fashion and react in thedesired way. Ladies and gentlemen, repeat after me... I am free... I amfree. Yes! yes! yes! You are free to do as we tell you; free to think aswe tell you; free to live as we tell you. And you are even free to die aswe tell you in the wars coldly created to destroy, control andmanipulate.The human race is free?No, no, no.The human race is a herd.Here we are, unique, eternal aspects of consciousness with an infinityof potential and we have allowed ourselves to become an unthinking,unquestioning blob of conformity and uniformity. A herd. Once weconcede to the herd mentality we can be controlled and directed by atiny few. And we are.I was standing in the sunshine one day surrounded by an enormousherd of sheep. The farmer arrived in his truck, climbed out, and stoodmotionless, leaning on his stick. Immediately a few of the sheep beganto walk towards him and within minutes it was like Exodus. Hundredsof sheep were following those few in front. Any stragglers who didn’tconform to this baa, baa mentality were given a dose of fear from thesheep dog and then they rushed into line also. In a ridiculously shorttime this combination of the baa, baa, and the fear had rounded up thewhole vast herd. All it took was one man doing very little and a sheepdog dispensing fear. As I observed this, I thought: “I’m looking at thehuman race here. This is how we are controlled”. We have stoppedthinking for ourselves and given our minds (power) away. Thereforewe follow the one in front in the most extraordinarily robotic fashion.And we are consumed by fear in every fibre of our being. Once ourfear responses are activated, we rush to conform even if we are awareenough to realise that what we are being asked to think, do, and say, isa nonsense. These weapons, the baa, baa, and the fear, allow anastonishingly few people to mould and direct the world in their ownperverted image, a process that is leading, unless we wake up and grow"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"3up, towards a world government, army, central bank and currency, anda microchipped population: in short, the total global control of everyman woman and child.While it may appear at first to be incredibly difficult for a relativehandful of people to control the lives of nearly six billion, it is in factcomparatively easy, once you have control of education and the media- the sources of the “information” and mantra messages which bombardthe conscious and subconscious mind from cradle to grave. Thesemessages are not designed to inform, but to direct and condition, todivide and rule. The religious, scientific, political and economicmanipulators position themselves between the truth and the humanconscious mind. They are the middlemen and women who seek to keepout of the public arena the knowledge that would open our minds toour real and infinite potential. We are fed a mental diet of pap and crapdesigned to diminish our sense of self and close down ourconsciousness until it becomes a pale shadow of what it can be. Itbecomes a sheep and the sheep become a herd. As someone once said,there are three types of person in the world: a tiny few who make thingshappen; a slightly larger number who watch things happen; and all therest who go around saying: what’s happening, what’s happening? Thetruth is denied to people because it will set them free. Instead, those atthe peak of the religious, scientific, political, and economic empires(the same state of mind in different clothes) hand down their versionof “truth”, a version which means that people must believe whateverthey want them to believe. And, to be fair, humanity does not have agreat record for demanding the truth or searching for it. We havedeveloped lazy minds. It’s appropriate that the word ignorance is anextension of the word ignore. We ignore so much and so we becomeignore-ant.Once you have conditioned one generation to think in the way yourequire, it becomes even easier to condition the next generation. Younow have the programmed parents working unknowingly on yourbehal{ conditioning their children to accept their own conditioned viewof life. Such parents don’t do this because they are bad people. Theydo it because they genuinely think their view is best for their children.But the effect is the same: one programmed generation helps toprogramme the next one because it does not respect anyone’s right tobe themselves. Each generation has a right to see life in a way thatmakes sense to them, not their parents, their teachers, or the guyreading the news. But sadly, people accept without thinking so much"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4that is passed down to them. They don’t ask the most liberatingquestion it is possible to ask: Why? Why do we do it this way? Whydo we believe this or that? Who says? The question “why?” is thedriving force behind evolution. When I spoke in the United States, anAmerican friend told me a story that brilliantly highlights what I mean.She said that when she was preparing dinner one day she cut the cornersoff the ham before putting it in the pan.“Why do you do that?” her husband asked.“I don’t know - my mother always used to do it.”“Why did your mother cut the corners off the ham?”“I don’t know, she just did - what’s it matter?”“Ring your mother and ask her why she cut the corners off the ham.”She rang her mother.“Mum, you know when I was a girl and you used to cut the cornersoff the ham? Why did you do that?”“Because my pan was never big enough!”If her husband had not asked the question “why?”, she would havecontinued to cut the corners off the ham and her children would quitepossibly have done it, too. This is how one generation allows its senseof self to be conditioned by older generations, parents, teachers andmedia people. They don’t question why. This sponge mentality and thedesire to impose one’s thoughts and beliefs on others has created anamazingly effective vehicle for the Elite to control the direction of theworld. It is what I have called the Hassle-Free Zone. Every dogma,belief-system, culture, and society has a Hassle-Free Zone. It workslike this: you set limits of acceptable thought, view and behaviour andanyone who steps outside of those very narrow limits is immediatelyeither ridiculed as “mad” or condemned as “bad”. In my case both!Some people stay within the Hassle-Free Zone because they arepersuaded that this desperately constricted view is indeed how lifeshould be lived. But there are very significant numbers of other people"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"5who realise how ridiculous the limits of the Zone are, but the fear offacing ridicule or condemnation ensures that they keep their mouthsshut and their heads down. As they say in Japan, the nail that standsout from the rest is the first one to be hit. Here again we have theHassle-Free Zone policed by those twin weapons, the baa, baa (thosewho accept the limitation of conditioned thought and view as theirreality) and the fear (those who think differently, but are frightened tosay so). This means that great swathes of humanity are living a lie anddenying what they really believe and what they really want to do withtheir lives. They don the mask. Stand in a crowded street and watch allthose people walking by. You are not looking at the real, infinite them.You are looking at the mask they project to the world. The mask theybelieve is acceptable enough to the rest of the prisoners to avoid beingridiculed or condemned for thinking and acting differently to thedemands of the Hassle-Free Zone. It is the fantastic tensions within thepsyche caused by this denial which lie at the heart of most mental,emotional, and therefore physical disease (dis-ease, disharmony) whichmanifests as illness, depression, suicide, a lack of fulfilment, and“what’s the point?”. This daily “war” in the psyche brings into conflictthat part of us which recognises our infinity and uniqueness, and theconscious level which seeks to deny such feelings because it fears theconsequences of expressing uniqueness in a world of programmeduniformity. These two levels of the psyche are what I term “I Am Me, IAm Free” and “Oh My God”.I Am Me, I Am Free, wishes to express and celebrate its uniqueness.Oh My God, is terrified of what that will mean in daily life. “Oh myGod, what will my family think if I say what I believe? What about thefellahs at work? And the guys down the bar? They’ll think I’ve gonemad. Oh my God!”If you want to be free, stop living a lie. Stop denying yourself. Youare a unique aspect of all that exists, the sum total of all your uniqueexperiences since you first became cC)nscious an infinity ago. That isa reason to be joyous. There is no aspect of consciousness in all creationthat is like you. You are special, as everyone is equally special. Butinstead of being joyous and proud of that specialness, we have allowedour uniqueness to become something to fear. Oh my God!Because we fear being ourselves, we are uncomfortable when anyonearound us decides to evacuate the Hassle-Free Zone and express theiruniqueness. Their dash for mental and emotional freedom makes astatement about us and our own mental and emotional prison. People"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6don’t like that and they react accordingly. “He’s mad” or “She’s bad”comes the reflex action, standard issue cry from the herd when it isfaced with someone determined to be themselves and not aprogrammed clone. And do you know what people are really sayingwhen they shout “mad” or “bad”? They are really saying “different”.Such is the scale of the conditioning absorbed by the human collectivemind that people can’t cope with anyone who dares to be different.“If I’m in prison, mate, you have to be too. It’s only fair.” We alsosuccumb to the myth about the “ordinary man and woman in the street‘ or the “common people”, the idea that the masses are just “ordinary”and only the few who are “extra-ordinary” achieve anything in life.We are “ordinary”, so we must know our place, this belief systemcontends. In truth, there is not an “ordinary” man, woman, child orblade of grass in the whole of creation, but people are persuaded tobelieve the myth and so they play out the role of being “ordinary”.It’s an act which they are conditioned to perform, like an actor on astage. Ordinary is not what we are, it is merely what we choose tobelieve we are. But it is very powerful in diminishing our sense ofworth; another motivation to give our minds away to those we believeto be our “betters”. It is part of the conditioning that includes theclaptrap that we are all born sinners, whatever the hell that is supposedto mean.Think about the consequences for your life and the planet that resultfrom this frar of being YOU. If we give our minds away to others andallow them to tell us what to think and do, and if we concede ouruniqueness to the fear of being different, we give control of this worldto a tiny Elite who use their power and manipulation to dictate thelimits of the Hassle-Free Zone. Whoever decides the point at which aview or lifestyle is inside or outside the Zone (the point at which youmeet ridicule or condemnation), also dictates the limits within whichbillions of people live their lives because they are terrified of beingdifferent from the herd. Again and again people say they support whatI am saying and doing, but they dare not say so for fear of theconsequences. Well it’s time to summon the courage, because theconsequences of keeping quiet are going to be far worse than speakingout and being proud of what you think and what you are. What’shappened to us, for goodness sake? We have taken on a massschizophrenia in which we have become both the prisoners of theHassle-Free Zone and its police force. Because we don’t respect ourown right to be unique, we conform to the limits of the Zone and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"7become a slave. Because we don’t respect everyone else’s right to beunique, we become the police force or the farmer hassling and herdingthe other slaves into acquiescence. The ridicule and condemnation canonly reach the levels required to frighten people into submission if themasses, the other slaves, play their part in dispensing it. We are notfrightened by what the presidents, prime ministers and global bankersthink about us - it is the reaction of our friends, family, and workmatesthat concerns us and frightens us into conformity. The reaction of theother slaves! The mental, emotional, and spiritual police force whichcontrols the masses is itself peopled by.. .the masses. It is like having acell full of prisoners and whenever one of the prisoners finds a meansof escape, all the other prisoners run to block the exit.Prejudice is the vital word here. People are conditioned to beprejudiced against other members and groups within each culture andsociety, and these different forms of prejudice are used to divide andrule the herd. The prejudice may be racial, religious or political, orbased on background, income, job or lifestyle. Either way you havedifferent aspects of society conditioned to instinctively ridicule, oppdseand condemn the views and life experiences of each other. And theprejudice is rarely only one way. Those who see themselves as victimsof prejudice are so often prejudiced themselves against other people,lifestyles and groups. This allows the manipulation of the massconsciousness to flourish and yet if we stopped seeking to impose ourversion of right and wrong, good and bad, moral and immoral uponeach other, we would remove the means for such global manipulation.We need to let go of all prejudice - now!We have given up our own unique identities to such an extent thatwe judge ourselves and others by the ‘lobs” that we do and the dogmaswe cling to. How we and they serve the system that controls us hasbecome our sense of identity, the symbol of who we are! What are you?Oh, I’m a Christian, a Muslim, a Socialist, a Republican, a Pagan. Wehave to be something instead of being someone - ourselves. We alsoask people we meet what they “do” for a living because we think thiswill give us a fix on “who” they are. “Oh you’re a stockbroker andyou’re a miner, and you’re a road sweeper. Right, got that - success,rough and dirty, complete failure. OK, I know you all now. Drinkanyone?” We judge people and ourselves, not by what we are, but bywhat we own or by what we “do”. This judgment corresponds with thesystem’s view of reality because we have conceded the right to expressour own uniqueness. Someone who makes millions by abusing the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8planet and great swathes of humanity every day by decisions they makein the global stockmarkets (casinos) is deemed to have “made it” to besuccessful. While others who do no-one any harm, and indeed maystrive to help people and give love to the world, are considered a failureif they happen to work in a low-paid job or be “unemployed”. A friendat school was always being laughed at because his father emptieddustbins for a living. But those who laughed worshipped famousfootballers. This is an example of our topsyturvy view of “success”.Who would we miss most if they did not work for a month, thefootballer or the garbage collector? The latter, of course, because thestreets and our homes would be full of rubbish and, eventually, disease.This attitude ofjudging each other by our “jobs” is to ignore and denywho we really are.We are not “stockbrokers”, “miners”, or “road sweepers”. These aremerely roles we play on the stage of life. A stockbroker today could bea pauper tomorrow. Our “role” is not “us”, just as the character that anactor plays is not the actor’s real persona. Our jobs and “roles” are atemporary vehicle for experience, that’s all. We are evolvingconsciousness on an eternal journey towards greater love, knowledgeand understanding, but we have forgotten this and we have beenencouraged to forget it. We are like actors who think the movie is realand we have taken on the personalities described in someone else’sscript. We think the role is “us”. It isn’t. But we have the actor playingthe stockbroker looking down his nose at the actor who is playing theroad sweeper when, in another life, another movie, those roles may bereversed. It’s only a game, but we think it’s real. That’s why it hasdegenerated into such a mess. We are taking the game too seriously.It’s just a movie and it is supposed to be fun.One enormous diversion that we have allowed to confuse us soeffectively is the concept of democracy. We have accepted en massethat democracy is another word for freedom. Like hell it is. Democracyis not freedom, it is a dictatorship camouflaged as freedom. The sameforce controls, directly or indirectly, every major political party andmovement. It created most of them. When you vote at an election, youare choosing between different aspects of the same force. The moneyand the media decide who becomes president of the United States andthe money and the media are owned and controlled by the same people.Let us write the following in letters 20 feet high: Democracy Is NotFreedom. 30 people telling 49 what to do is not freedom.

Freedom is the right of all people toexpress who they are, what they think, and how they wish to live theirlives: free from imposition or hassle from anyone. It is to be able tocelebrate our individual uniqueness without rules, regulations, ridiculeand condemnation from those who seek to impose their view of lifeupon the rest of us.Until we respect our own, and everyone’s, right to be different, tomake our own choices, and create our own conscious realities free fromimposition and pressure to conform, we will remain in a prison of ourown making. We will continue to be both the policeman and theprisoner. And a handful of people with a deeply unpleasant agenda willcontinue to run the world. The choice, as always, is ours.

Sound like a contradiction? Here I am saying we are uniqueand at the same time that we have a misguided belief that we aredifferent. There is no contradiction.We are unique within our multidimensional consciousness, but withinthe limited vision of the Hassle-Free Zone there are endless “differences”we call dogmas which are, in truth, not different at all. The devotees ofChristian dogma think they are different from those who are slavesofjewish dogma. The fundamentalist rabbi believes he is different fromthe fundamentalist ayatollah. But they are not. They are the same thoughtpattern with a slightly different dress on. They are all prisoners of adogma who wish to convert other prisoners to accept the same dogma.They all use fear, guilt and other forms of imposition to manipulate andfrighten people into line. Their line. What is the difference between thenuns at a Roman Catholic convent using fear and guilt to control thethinking of children and young people, and a rabbi or muslim cleric usingthe fear of hell and damnation and enormous family pressures to do thesame? Answer: nothing. They are different aspects of the same state ofmind, but they think they are different to the point where their dogmascome into physical conflict. They are all arrogant enough to claim theyknow the “will of God” and they claim to have been chosen to telleveryone what God insists they believe. Poor old God must have aproduction line turning out His different “wills”. Either that, or He (it’salways a “He”) has great difficulty making up His mind. God used to beindecisive, but now He’s not so sure.

My will is that the Pope should tell all peoplehow to live their lives and that he and the Vatican should be controlledby the upper levels of the secret society network like the Freemasonsand the Knights of Malta. If any Pope does not agree to this control, heshould be murdered (as with Pope John Paul I in 1978). I also will thatthe Pope and the Roman Catholic Church should terrify little childrento prepare them for a life of being told what to do and to ensure thatthey believe what the church wants them to believe. I will that aninquisition should be formed by said Pope to burn everyone he and hishenchmen decide do not believe in every single word of my bible, theKing James version of which has been documented to have 36,191errors in translation alone. I will that my son, the Prince of Peace (alsoknown quite wrongly as “Jesus”)1, should be nailed to a cross and sufferunbelievable pain so that the rest of humanity shall be able to kill andplunder each other while having their sins forgiven forever!Oh, my God! Sorry, oh my Me! That doesn’t sound right. It’s not veryGodly and I am God after all. Er, no, er I’ve changed my mind:My will now is that Jews are my chosen people, even though, contraryto worldwide indoctrination, there is no such thing as a Jewish “race”,just as there is no “Aryan” race, either. I will that the Jewish hierarchyshould terrfiy their children to prepare them for a life of being told whatto do and to ensure they conform to whatever the hierarchy tells them.This fear should be constantly applied throughout their lives. Theyshould be made to fear terrorist attacks (for which their own hierarchyare often responsible) and made to believe that only by giving theirminds and power away to the hierarchy will they be protected from theirenemies. As I gave a strip of land to my chosen people thousands ofyears ago (or so the history books tell me, I don’t remember myself), Iwill that the Palestinian Arabs should be terrorised out of their homes,that their land be called Israel, and that some of the terrorists involvedsuch as Ben-Gurion, Begin, Rabin, and Shamir, should later becomeprime ministers and display record-breaking hypocrisy by denouncingthe terrorism of others.

That doesn’t sound right, either. It’s not very Godly and Iam God after all. Er, no, er, I’ve changed my mind again:This time I will that my real voice on Earth is the Muslim hierarchyand that they should terr([y their children to prepare them for a lfie ofbeing told what to do and to ensure they conform to my rules. I told allthis to a guy called Mohammed a long time ago and he was very goodbecause he and his successors led a vast army of followers to kill andmaim anyone who didn’t accept them as my representatives on Earth. Iwill that the religion called Islam created in my name should be used tokeep the people in fear, guilt, and order while my hierarchy use the oilmoney for their own benefit and keep the rest of the people in servitudeand poverty in the name of my religion. I will that women should not beable to show more than their eyes in public because, although I createdthe physical body, I am terribly ashamed of it.

No-one is “born” a Christian, a Jew or aMuslim. People are conditioned to be Christians, Jews and Muslimsafter they are born. When we take on someone else’s beliefs, lock, stockand barrel, and especially when we need to be frightened into acceptingthem, we walk a very dark and dangerous road: for ourselves and forthe world.But so few have learned this lesson of the centuries. We still believetoo much and think too little. We “feel” intuitively even less. Therigidity and manipulation of “beliefs” (dogma and prejudice) is howwe are controlled. Today, with the dawn of the 21st century almostupon us, we still have men in dog collars and frocks sitting around atable decoding what we should or should not believe. Billions ofpeople continue to be controlled and limited by their devotion to thefalse gods called Popes, priests, archbishops, rabbis, ayatollahs andtheir like across the spectrum of religious beliefs which have beenpeddled and poisoned over the centuries by those in pursuit of control.Even worse, the desire is to pressure others to believe the same andwhenever anyone asks an unanswerable question of religion (notdifficult) out is wheeled the trusty break-the-glass-and-use-in-all-emergencies reply of “have faith”. I remember being told on aNorthern Ireland radio programme after I listed a few religiouscontradictions that these were things that God did not want us toknow! Have we learned nothing with the passage of time? And forthose who have evolved beyond the child-like state of off-the-pegreligion, there are other dogmas waiting to ensnare them. Political,scientific, environmental and “New Age” dogma among them. Aswith religion, these “opposites” are merely aspects of the same stateof mind. I am told that Communism (the far Left) is different fromNazism (the far Right). The idea is ludicrous. The far Left, assymbolised by Josef Stalin, believes in centralised control, militarydictatorship, and concentration camps. The far Right, as symbolisedby Adolf Hitler, believes in centralised control, military dictatorship,and concentration camps. Spot the difference? Of course not. Whenyou peel away the smoke-screen rhetoric, they are the same. Yet thesetwo “opposites” went to war with each other and across the world theCommunists go on “anti-Nazi” marches and Nazis protest against theCommunists.

Socialism believes thatthis production should be controlled by the few at the centre who dictatethe economic pQlicy. Capitalism believes in the survival of thestrongest which leads to control by the few at the centre, who dictateeconomic policy. On the fundamentals, they are two sides of the samethought wave and yet socialism and capitalism (cartelism) are portrayedas opposite dogmas offering an alternative view. On the Right, theywish to stop the free flow of information which challenges their dogma.On the Left, the Robot Radicals, as I call them, wish to stop the freeflow of information which challenges their dogma. The Right seek toassassinate the character of those who disagree with them and to denya public platform for their views. The Left, the Robot Radicals, seek toassassinate the character of those who disagree with them and to denya public platform for their views. Again, spot the difference? My ownexperience of “Nazi” behaviour has almost always come from thoseclaiming to be “anti-Nazis”. The anti-fascist fascists are a wonder tobehold. The mental gymnastics and self delusion required for such astate of mind defies the imagination.Throughout the Hassle-Free Zones of religious, political, “scientific”and economic dogma you find these “oppo-sames” fighting andcondemning each other. In the United States, the main opposition to theGlobal Conspiracy, which I expose in ... and the truth shall set you freeand The Robots’ Rebellion, is the Christian Patriot Movement. You willfind the same mindset within the Islamic Patriot Movement, the JewishPatriot Movement, ad infinitum. I welcome the efforts of the ChristianPatriots to make public the plans to create a centralised global tyrannyand a microchipped, robotic, population. But what is their alternative?The return to an imposed Christian dogma and national flag waving.Some call for the people behind the conspiracy to be hanged and forpeople to defend themselves with guns and violence. You don’t stop atyranny with another tyranny. You don’t stop violence with violence. Andyou don’t eliminate hatred with more hatred. You just double the hatred.Nor do you remove divisions by waving your flag, putting the wants of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"15your country above the needs of others on the planet, and claiming thatyour nation and people are the best in the world.You stop a tyranny with freedom for all; you end violence by beingpeaceful; you eliminate hatred with love; you end dogma with freedomof expression; and you remove divisions by realising that all of us areOne - all aspects of the same infinite consciousness we call God.Within the Hassle-Free Zone there are so few differences betweenpeople in their basic attitudes and responses. They are aspects of thesame herd. It is outside the Zone that we discover our true uniqueness.On the inside the “differences” have to be manufactured to present uswith an illusion of choice and variety, otherwise we would soonrealise that, yes indeed, humanity is a blob of programmed, uniformthought. For this reason “sames” are portrayed as “opposites”. It’s alla con. Opposites don’t fight each other. Oppo-sames fight each other.The opposite of the desire to fight and impose is the desire to loveand set free. These opposites cannot fight because one will alwaysrefuse to do so. It is not part of its belief system to fight. So whenyou see physical and verbal conflict it is always between aspects ofthe same state of mind - oppo-sames - and never between opposites.Here lies the whole basis of divide and rule: create divisions withmanufactured, non-existent “differences” and then play them offagainst each other.Let us recap. Humanity is in prison because:aIt gives its mind away and concedes its responsibility and power tothink for itself.bIt is consumed by fear, especially the fear of what other people think- the fear of being different and unique.cIt seeks to impose its dogmas on everyone and denies the right ofeach of us to be different and have our own, unique, view.In the light of this, the means of escape from the global Alcatraz isbreathtakingly obvious:aWe think for ourselves and refuse to allow others to tell us what todo, be and say.bWe let go of fear because fear is our creation.

This is the emotion that hashanded control of our lives to the manipulating clique which I call theGlobal Elite.Once you can make people fearful they will look to someone toprotect them from whatever they have been conditioned to fear. This iswhy history, and the world today, is full of hyped up “monsters” and“dangerous people” - a focus of fear from which we must look to our“leaders” to save us. The fact that these “monsters” and our “leaders”are both appointed and controlled by the same force is kept from us.We are programmed to see two “sides”, largely projected as “good andevil”, when there are not two sides, but one. In ... and the truth shallset you free, I highlight hundreds of people, events and organisations,who in the public arena appear to be in opposition, but in truth areconnected to the same Global Elite. Among these connections, forexample, are those between George Bush and Saddam Hussein, the“opponents” in the Gulf War of 1991. The manufactured Cold Warbetween the West and the Soviet Union was another classic of this kind.Both populations were so filled with fear of each other that they gavestill more power to their “leaders” and accepted grotesque weaponsexpenditure in the misguided belief that they must be protected fromthe “enemy”. The make-believe, propaganda-created, enemy, as it turnsout. Both sides, including Ronald Reagan, George Bush, MikhailGorbachev; and other Soviet and American leaders were controlled bythe same people. They were the same side.The Global Elite, the few who decide the direction of the world andhumanity, sit atop a pyramid of manipulation (Figure 1 overleaf).Almost every organisation today is structured as a pyramid.

People inthe lower compartments will have no idea what they are part of.Figure 1know its real agenda and what it really wants to achieve. As you comedown from the peak, you are meeting more and more people who knowless and less about that agenda. This is called compartmentalisation.Those at the top ensure that everyone lower down in the pyramid knowonly their own individual contribution to the organisation, company,secret society, whatever. As a result most of them think their work isquite innocent because they are not allowed to know how their workfits in with the others in the pyramid to create a pattern that is anythingbut innocent. Only the elite at the top know how these individualcontributions fit together and in this way you have people throughoutthe pyramid working in ignorance of what they are really a part of. TheFreemasons and other secret societies are an obvious example of thismethod with their levels of initiation. Each level has no · idea of theknowledge held in the levels above them. The vast majority offreemasons never progress higher than the third degree, but there areanother 30 official levels above that in the so called Scottish Rite andthen another 13 unofficial levels, known as Illuminati levels, which arenot even acknowledged to exist. The majority of freemasons, down"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"19there on the bottom three levels, are oblivious to what that organisationis really there to do. They are a manipulated, largely unknowingsmoke-screen for the few who control the secret society. When thefreemasonic network is named as a tool of the conspiracy, people thinkyou are saying that every freemason is seeking to take over the world.That’s simply not true. It’s just ridiculous. Secret societies, like almosteverything, consist of the leaders (the few) and the led (the rest).So it is with the global pyramid within which you find all theorganisations that control our lives - the banking system, political system,multinational corporation network, the media, “education”, intelligenceagencies, military and so on. The peaks of their individual pyramids allfuse together into the peak of the global pyramid, controlled by theridiculously few people I have called the Global Elite. From that peak,the same policy, methods and aims filter down through all these,apparently unconnected, aspects of society. At this Elite level all thebanks, political parties, newspapers and broadcast media, intelligenceagencies, multinational companies, and secret societies, are owned orcontrolled by the SAME people. This is so important to grasp. The mythof choice is there to fool us into believing we are free. Look at how manycompanies the multinational corporations own. These “companies” eachhave a different trade name and appear at first glance to be independentof their “competitors”, but they are owned by the same people. Two ofthe biggest electronics retailers in the UK, Dixons and Currys, are ownedby the same group and yet on the high street they appear to be incompetition. It is the same with the UK’s two leading roadsiderestaurants, Little Chef and Happy Eater. The examples of this all overthe world are endless. The global food chain is overwhelminglycontrolled by three multinational corporations operating through scoresof different trade names string-pulled from the centre. Choice? What ajoke. Something like 99% of those working within these organisationshave no comprehension of how they are being used. The people who sitbehind the counter in a bank won’t be aware of what is going on in theirown manager’s office, let alone what is discussed at board level or abovethat by the Global Elite. They’re just pawns in someone else’s game.They keep their heads down, close their minds, and do as they are told -just like the human race as a whole. This submission to another’s viewand the suppression of our own individuality allows the Global Elite toset the limits of the Hassle-Free Zones by filtering down the same policyand attitudes throughout the pyramid. They do this through a network oforganisations which include the Royal Institute of International Affairs"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20in London, the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, theTrilateral Commission (US-Europe-Japan), and the most influential ofthem, the Bilderberg Group. There are many other offshoots of thisnetwork, like the Pinay Circle or “Le Cerde” which works to removepolitical leaders deemed unacceptable to the Elite. These privateorganisations have in their membership the top people in politics,business, banking, the military, the media, education, etc., who thenpervade the pyramid with a single overall plan which has led to greatercentralisation of power every year. All these institutions which controlthe direction of our lives are themselves controlled at the peak of thepyramid by the same people. You can read about this network in greatdetail in ... and the truth shall set you free.I was invited in 1995 to the memorial service for a great Britishcomedian, Larry Grayson, and there a story was told whichencapsulated our plight and the means of escape. During thiscelebration of Larry’s life, one of his experiences was told to theassembled throng by another comedian, Roy Hudd. It was a story fromthe days when Larry used to travel the variety halls of the UK and onthis occasion he was part of an all-male show which had one “woman”taking part - a dressed up Larry Grayson. The producer was verypatriotic, Larry had once recalled, and the show’s big finish was arendition of the song, Rule Britannia. The rest of the cast came onwearing sailors uniforms and they climbed on each others shoulders toform a human pyramid on the stage. At this point, on walked Larrydressed as Britannia with the long gown, the helmet, shield and sword,and he was manhandled up the pyramid to the top for the finale of theshow. One night, he said, things seemed to be going rather well. Butthen he noticed that the sailor in the bottom left hand corner of thepyramid had got rather a cough.“And as any ancient Egyptian will tell you” Larry had observed “Thatis a very important part of the pyramid!”Anyway, this sailor’s cough became progressively worse until he hadto step out of the pyramid. And what happened? The whole structurecollapsed with sailors going in all directions. Larry Grayson’s shieldwent one way, his sword another, and he finished up in someone’s lapin the second row. What had caused the pyramid to disintegrate? NotLarry Grayson at the top (symbolic of the Global Elite), but one sailorat the bottom (symbolic of the “ordinary” man and woman in the street).The real power in a pyramid is at the bottom, not the top, but the humanrace has been conditioned to believe the opposite.

The childlike way in which we think what weare told to think never ceases to take my breath away. For 48 hoursafter the Oklahoma bombing in 1995, it was a nightmare to be an Arabin the United States. Why? Because the government (elements of whichplanted the bomb as we shall eventually realise) announced that theremight be a Middle East connection. Arabs in America, and even thosewho only looked like Arabs, were harangued in the street in the wakeof this announcement. Two days or so later the same government saidthere was not a Middle East connection1 and suddenly it was OK to bean Arab again. Those who responded like this were “adults” acting likebabes in arms, puppets on the strings of official pronouncements, andfodder for the Global Elite.There is no limit to the examples every day of people playing therobot. When I started to reveal the background to the global conspiracyand name the names and organisations involved, the campaign todiscredit me began. I was dubbed “anti-Jewish” and a “neo-Nazi”. Nowthat was no surprise because everyone who gets close to the truth ofwho really controls the world is attacked in the same way. The GlobalElite has two main defence responses - assassinating those who arelifting the veil or assassinating their character by branding them anti-Jewish and Nazi. What followed in the campaign to discredit me wasthe final confirmation that large tracts of the human race no longer haveaccess to their own minds. The people behind these attacks on me were1In fact I belicvc there was a Middic East conncetion to that bombing - the Israeliintelligence agency, Mossad, via an organisation called the Anti-Defamation League, hutthat’s another story.

They wrote an astonishing article fullof untruths in their own little known magazine and then, by their ownadmission, they began to hawk this “story” around the mainstreammedia. Some newspapers refused to print it, but others like TheGuardian and The New Statesman ran this nonsense. More thenfollowed. Over a period of a year, virtually every magazine articlemaking these accusations was written by Matthew Kalman and JohnMurray and almost every newspaper article was based on “information”supplied by Matthew Kalman and John Murray. A magazine called NewMoon ran a stunning misrepresentation of my book, ... and the truthshall set you free. I was called a Nazi and the front page consisted of apicture of me changed to resemble Adolf Hitler. The article was writtenby Matthew Kalman and John Murray and the magazine was editedby.. .Matthew Kalman. The New Age magazine, Kindred Spirit, alsoran a long letter calling me a Nazi and anti-Jewish. The letter writerwas... Matthew Kalman.So the claims of me being an anti-Jewish Nazi were, overwhelmingly,put into the public arena by two people. Two people. But given thecurrent state of human consciousness, that’s all it takes to mind-controlmillions. Amazing, but true. In fact you don’t even need two people,one is enough.

Articles seekingto discredit me, and therefore my information, were also carefullyplaced in the “alternative” media to target people who are naturallysuspicious of authority. Unfortunately such people have beenconditioned to believe the alternative media as unquestioningly asothers believe the mainstream media. Do they really think the Elitewould not seek to infiltrate these “alternatives” also for their own ends?The Brighton story is a wonderful example of how the few canprogramme the many, but millions of other examples are happeningaround the world every time the clock ticks.A tiny elite can’t control the world by conditioning the human mind?It’s child’s play.The human race is not evil. It has merely allowed itself to become amanipulator’s dream. It has given up thinking to such a degree that theGlobal Elite can condition what passes for human brain-cell activityand therefore control the direction of the world. This is the coup d’etaton the mind which I have written about in other books. It is not somuch that the Global Elite want to tell us what to think, it is more acase of conditioning people not to think. There are many methods,developed and honed by Elite-controlled organisations around theworld, which are designed to do this. The key technique is something Icall problem-reaction-solution (P-R-S). You create a problem, be it awar a run on a currency, a health “scare”, a government collapse,whatever suits your plans at the time. You make sure, however, thatsomeone else is blamed for this “problem” and not you. This isessential. You then use the global media, which you also own andcontrol, to pressure public opinion into demanding action - the“something must be done” syndrome. In response to this manipulated“problem” and the stimulated public “reaction”, you then openly offer"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"26the “solution” to the problem you have created. This “solution” iswhat you planned to do all along, but problem-reaction-solution meansthat not only do you avoid serious opposition to your plans, youactually manipulate the people into demanding that you do what youintended to do anyway!Some examples:The goal of the Elite is a world government to which nation states,even continents, would be subordinate. They call this the New WorldOrder. The constant process of centralising economic and politicalpower over hundreds of years has not just happened at random: it hasbeen by manipulated design. The centralisation on a global level witha world government is only the natural outcome of this policy. Whoevercontrolled the world government (Global Elite) would control the worldcentral bank and world currency, which are also part of the agendaknown as the New World Order. In short, whoever controlled the worldgovernment would control the planet even more comprehensively thanthey do now. But world governments don’t just happen. They have tobe manipulated into existence and at the heart of that strategy must bea plot to discredit the status quo, the community and the nation state. Ifthat is working well and harmony reigns, people are not going to accepta world government telling them what to do. You have to create theperceived “need” and this is where problem-reaction-solution is soeffective. As I and many others have documented in their books, it isprovable that the same global bankers and their networks funded allsides in the First and Second World Wars, and indeed funded theRussian Revolution which brought us the tyranny known as“communism”. I know it sounds staggering at first, but those whofinanced Britain, Amerjca, and the Allies in those wars also funded theGermans and Adolf Hitler. Why on Earth would they do that? To followtheir long term agenda of total global control. The main aim of amanipulated war is to change the nature of post war society. The worldbecame more centralised as a result of the First World War and evenmore so after the second global conflict. That was the idea (Figure 2).The horror and destruction of the First World War led to anunderstandable cry of “something must be done” and the Elite proposedtheir “solution”, the League of Nations, their first attempt at a globalorganisation which could be evolved step by step into the worldgovernment. They didn’t manage to do that on this occasion and the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"27League of Nations eventually collapsed. But after the Second WorldWar came two other Elite creations (provable),the United Nations andthe European Union. The alleged reason for the UN’s existence was toprevent wars, but now, as always planned, we see the UN, and NATO,being used as mere vehicles for the creation, again step by step, of theworld army under central control. A world army, which, far fromstopping wars, actually fights them! The same principle applies to thecreation of communism and the Soviet Union which was achieved viafunding and political manipulation from the United States and theUnited Kingdom. The creation of two “sides” is an essential part ofmanipulating peoples’ fear. To the “West” the Soviet Union wasportrayed as a dangerous monster, the “evil empire”, while in the SovietUnion, the “West” was portrayed in the same way. Fear, divide andrule, the old, old story.The world army scenario is another obvious example of Problem-Reaction-Solution. If you want a world army and you want the peopleto accept it or even demand it, first of all you need a problem. If theFigure 2"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"28United Nations peacekeeping operation is effective, that is disastrousunder the rules of Problem-Reaction-Solution. No Problem NoReaction No Solution. You therefore manipulate events in places likeBosnia to ensure that the UN peacekeeping force is not working. Themore you can embarrass the UN operation the better, because as horrificpictures came out of Bosnia day after day the cry of “something mustbe done” became, again understandably, louder and louder. Thisprovided the opportunity for the solution - a 60,000 strong “NATO”(world army), the biggest multinational force to be assembled since theSecond World War. Another mighty step towards the creation of theworld army and the dismantling of nation state armies under the guiseof “peace” had been achieved. That was the real reason for the Bosnianconflict, hard as I know it must be to accept if you are new to thisresearch. But if you read ... and the truth shall set you free you willappreciate from the evidence and background that such a conclusion isglaringly obvious. Virtually every major peace negotiator in Bosnia,from the start of that conflict, was a member of a network of theBilderberg Group (Bil), the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), theTrilateral Commission (TC), and the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs (RIIA). These organisations are controlled by the same GlobalElite that manipulated the conflict into being and then funded andarmed all sides in the horror that ensued. The European Union peacenegotiators were Lord Carrington (Bil, TC, RIA), Lord David Owen(Bil, TC) and Carl Bildt (Bil). They worked with the UN negotiatorsCyrus Vance (Bil, TC, CFR) and Thorvald Stoltenberg (Bil, TC). Then,amid worldwide publicity, appeared the “independent” peacenegotiator, Jimmy Carter, the first Trilateral Commission President ofthe United States and CFR member. After him came the group whonegotiated the world army in Bosnia through the so called DaytonAgreement. These were Richard Holbrook (Bil, TC, CFR), whoanswered to the US Secretary of State Warren Christopher (CFR, TC),who in turn reported to President Bill Clinton (Bil, TC, CFR). Theworld army in the former Yugoslavia was headed from the start by USAdmiral Leighton Smith (CFR) and the civilian aspects of the operationare overseen by Carl Bildt (Bil).Lord Carrington, the former British cabinet minister, who becamechairman of the Bilderberg Group in 1991, works closely with HenryKissinger, one of the world’s most prolific manipulators on behalf ofthe Elite. Interestingly, the horrific war in Rwanda erupted three daysafter an undisclosed “diploniatic mission” to that country led by Lord"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"29Carrington and Henry Kissinger. The former Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin (a Kissinger frontman, later assassinated) also agreed armsshipments to Rwanda in the run up to the conflict. People think it mustbe difficult to start a war, but it isn’t you know. It’s easy, given the desireof so many to give their minds away. To fight a war you need moneyand weapons. The Global Elite control the supply of both, so that’s nevera problem. To start a war you need one “side” to attack another countryor community and away we go. The other country or community willdefend itself and the war has begun. Many people are so full of dogmaand racial division and intolerance that finding a group who will attackanother is hardly difficult. You are spoilt for choice. The Global Elitenormally ensure that their “employees” or puppets are leading all “sides”,as with Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and WinstonChurchill, in the Second World War. The Global Elite representatives(also known as presidents and prime minsters) then sell a fairy story tothe human herd about the need to “fight for freedom” or “take our God-given right to this land” and suddenly you have two herds knocking sevenbells out of each other. Creating a war, even a world war, is not difficult.It’s a doddle. It shouldn’t be, I know, but until humanity wakes up andgrows up, it will be so.When you look at the major posts around the world, like the SecretaryGeneral of NATO, the heads of the World Bank, the World TradeOrganisation and the European Union Commission, or presidents, primeministers and top politicians, bankers and industrialists, you find theyare members Of’ or attendees of’ the organisations I mention. Thatincludes Bill Clinton, George Bush and virtually every president of theUnited States since the 1920s. Being invited to join or attend these groupscan be a great career move. Bill Clinton was a little known governer forArkansas until he attended the 1991 Bilderberg meeting in Badan Badan,Germany, at the invitation of his mentors, the Rockefellers. Within oneyear he was successfully campaigning to become president of the mostpowerful country on Earth. In Britain, there is a similar tale of rapidprogress involving Tony Blair. He was a Labour Party home affairsspokesman when he was invited to the Bilderberg meeting inVouliagmeni, Greece, in 1993. The following year he became leaderof the Labour Party and would-be prime minister just as his opposition,the Conservative Party, began to suffer a stream of scandals and upsets.Blair’s desire to be viewed as a potential world leader was enhancedwhen he was received and supported by Bilderberg frontmen likeClinton and Chancellor Kohl of Germany. When Blair visited the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"30United States in 1996, his welcoming party read like a Who’s Who ofthe Elite’s gofers and manipulators. These included Bill Clinton (Bil,CFR, TC), Henry Kissinger (Bil, CFR, TC, RIA), Alan Greenspan, thehead of the Elite-controlled Federal Reserve banking system (Bil, CFR,TC) and the global financial speculator George Soros (Bil). So manyof Blair’s views and policies, including those on the European Union,mirror those of the Elite. I can’t help thinking that he has the look of a“chosen one”, whether he knows it or not. These common connectionsbetween top politicians, peace negotiators, and the people in the majorglobal posts, are never revealed in the mainstream media. I wonderwhy? The hundreds of papers and magazines worldwide owned by theHollinger Group, including Telegraph Newspapers in the UK, don’tmention this covert network because the group is controlled by theCanadian Conrad Black, a core steering committee member of theBilderberg Group. He hosted their 1996 meeting in Toronto and two ofhis Hollinger/Telegraph directors are Lord Carrington and HenryKissinger, along with many other New World Order frontmen andmanipulators. Maybe the influence of another Bilderberg steeringcommittee member, Andrew Knight, on the board of Rupert Murdoch’sNews International might just be a reason why its newspapers and othermedia outlets remain silent on this subject. The Washington Post refusesto inform the public about these organisations and their membershipbecause the Post is owned by Katherine Graham (Bil, CFR, TC). Onand on it goes. Your mind is being stitched up and so, therefore, is theplanet.Another highly effective conditioning technique is what I call thestepping-stones approach. The whole conspiracy is based on mindmanipulation and the Elite are very careful not to go too far too quickly.If they did, even the bewildered herd might see that something is goingon. Instead, the Elite set their goal and move towards it stage by stage.Each of these stages are promoted as independent of each other when,in fact, they are coordinated steps towards a long agreed target. Thestepping-stones technique changes the world before your eyes in a waywhich ensures that most people won’t see that anything is changing atall - until it’s too late. I have a three year old son called Jaymie andbecause I have seen quite a lot of him up to now, despite my travels, hedoesn’t seem to change much. He’s changed slowly before my eyesevery day and it mostly goes unnoticed. But people who haven’t seenhim for a few weeks or months look at him and say: “My goodness,Jaymie, haven’t you grown, haven’t you changed!” This is the basis of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"31the stepping-stones technique and it is being used to introduce the Eliteagenda by stealth.Take the European Union. It was created, as I show in ... and thetruth shall set you free, by the same people and organisations whointroduced the League of Nations and the United Nations. TheEuropean Union, with its plan for centralised political control, aEuropean Central Bank and a European currency, the Euro, was plottedfrom the start to be the vehicle through which to impose the centralisedcontrol of Europe, itself merely a stage on the road to the worldgovernment, central bank, currency, army and a microchippedpopulation. That, of course, is not what the people of Europe were toldwhen we were asked to join. The “European Union” was then calledthe European Economic Community or Common Market. We were toldwe were joining a “free trade” area and not a centralised Europeansuperstate which would eventually encompass the countries of theformer Soviet Union. Once we were in the web and the economies ofEurope were intertwined enough to make withdrawal very difficult inthe short term, the process began of changing the Common Market“free trade” area into the all-along-planned European tyranny, theEuropean Union. Only now are more people beginning to realise howfar this transformation has already progressed. The same process isunderway with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)which is planned to evolve into the North-Central-South Americanversion of the European Union and this applies to the Asia-Australia“free trade area” known as APEC.This has all long been planned. It is no coincidence that one of theplans of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis was the creation of what they calledthe Europaische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft. This translates as.. .TheEuropean Economic Community! After 1945, the Nazi mentalitymerely swapped its jackboots and tin helmets for smart business suits.Appropriately, the introduction of the European single currency willinvolve the transfer of the gold, currency and bond reserves of allmember states to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.This bank will be controlled by six unelected bankers with a guaranteedeight year period in office and, as the Maastricht Treaty says, this “supersix” cannot have their decisions overturned. They become a legalEuropean dictatorship. My goodness, Adolf Hitler would have beendelighted to see his plan unfold under the guidance of another Germanleader, Chancellor Helmet Kohl, a longtime and passionate frontmanfor the Bilderberg Group."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"32The introduction of “voluntary” identity cards in the UK is a classiccase of the stepping-stones principle. If the government (Global Elite)had made them compulsory it would have triggered opposition fromcivil liberties groups and started a debate about the erosion of freedom.But by introducing them initially as “voluntary” that opposition wasspiked. Then you ensure that it is increasingly difficult to operatewithout the cards and you offer incentives to carry them. In the endyou achieve your goal but without the hassle of concerted oppositionor public debate.The stepping-stones technique is also being used to phase out cash andmove us ever closer to the day when all money will be electronic andfinancial transactions will be processed via computers and tinymicrochips under the skin which will carry all financial and personaldetails. We are being conditioned to believe that the phasing out of notesand coins will make everything more “efficient” and the manipulatorsare appealing to human prejudice by emphasising how the end of cashwill stop social security fraud and tax evasion. The real reason, however,is control. Once cash has gone we hand the power over our lives to acomputer and its programmer. If you go into a shop now with a creditcard (electronic money) and the computer refuses to accept it, at leastyou still have another means of purchase, you can pay cash. But whathappens when there is no cash and the computer says no to your creditcard or microchip? How do you purchase? You can’t. The computer, andwhoever programmes its responses, controls what, when, and if you buyMore than that, as some electronics engineers have warned, once we havea microchip inside us, messages can pass from the computer to the chipwhich can create mass anger, hysteria, aggression, and a stream of otheremotions. We will literally be robots then. And this is no science fictionsometime-maybe prediction. It is desperately close and trials involvingmicrochipping are already in operation around the world. The technologyexists and the only thing left is to manipulate the human mind to acceptit. This conditioning has been underway for some time and themicrochipping of domestic animals is becoming routine. In the Autumnof 1995 I saw an item on the BBC’s “science” programme, Tomorrow’sWorld, which looked very positively at a scheme to microchip peoplewith their medical records. A woman was featured with a microchip inher chest and along came the doctor with a bar-code reader like thosethey use in the supermarkets. As he ran this contraption down her front,up on the screen came her medical information. “Oh I think it’s awonderful idea” the lady told the camera “It’s very convenient”."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"33I’m sorry, would you just excuse me once more?Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!Thank you.You can see the potential when you look at how satellite televisionoperates. Each subscriber has a card programmed to accept the channelsthey have paid for. If later you wish to subscribe to another channel,you might think you would have to send away for a new card. No, no.You ring the subscribers’ department and they ask you to put thetelevision on the station you want. At this point all you see is ascrambled fuzz. Then before your eyes, the scrambled channel appearsin seconds. How did they do that?, I asked. They send out a signalwhich reprogrammes your card and no-one else’s! They have the ability,even on satellite television, to isolate one card in one television in onehome. And they can’t do that with a microchip inside one person? Ofcourse they can and that’s the idea.If you do nothing else to stand up for freedom, I would at least askyou to consider the consequences for you and your children of allowingthe programme of human microchipping to commence unchallenged.You will be hearing a stream of “justifications” for microchipping,including the microchipping of children at birth (“You’ll never loseyour child again”), the storing of financial information to make creditcards redundant (“We can end credit card theft and fraud”), and themeans to prove identity (“It will help to end crime, remove the needfor passports, and stop illegal immigration and social security fraud”).All these claims and more are designed to manipulate your mind intoaccepting the microchip which will turn you into a fully fledged robot.The microchip and the cashless society are part of that fundamentaltool in the control of human existence.. .the world financial system.Ask most people why they are not doing or saying what they reallybelieve is right and the reason will be fear. A major expression of thatfear is the need to earn money to live. Again, that’s the idea. If you canartificially inflate the cost of the basics of life, food, warmth, clothing,and shelter, you pressure people to serve your system to earn the moneyto buy those basics. The less you need to earn, the more choice youhave to live your life as you see fit. The more you need to earn, thefewer the choices. This scam is founded on the greatest con trick ofthem all - the paying of interest on money that doesn’t exist. The fact"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"34that we stand for this as a human race, reveals so much about thescale of the collective mind-cloning that has unfolded on this planet.The Elite-controlled banks are legally lending as a matter of courseten thousand pounds for every thousand pounds they actually own. Itis like you owning a hundred pounds, but lending a thousand poundsto your friends and charging them interest. Should each of your friendsdemand cash in their hands, you couldn’t work this scam, but the bankshave no such problem because most of their transactions do not involvecash. They work mostly with theoretical “money” - cheques and creditcards. If everyone went to the bank to ask for their money back at thesame time, the banks would be bankrupt many times over because theyare lending far more than they have deposited with them. All but afraction of the money that the banks “loan” doesn’t physically exist.Most people believe that banks lend only the money that customershave deposited with them. This is simply not true. What the banks lendis, in effect... nothing. When you go to a bank for a loan your accountis “credited” with that amount. All the bank has done is to type theamount of your loan, say £10,000, onto a computer disk. If the bankwas lending you its customers money, their accounts would have to bereduced by £10,000 to allow you to have the loan. But they’re not. Theyremain the same. So where has this mysterious £10,000 suddenlyappeared from? Your “loan”, as with every “loan”, is conjured out ofnothing as merely figures on a computer screen! And from that momentyou begin to pay interest on that non-existent money. More than that,this phantom “money” is even counted in the bank’s accounts as an“asset” and this allows it to make yet more loans of the same kind.With every loan, the borrower goes into debt and the bank’s officialassets increase, and yet not one new coin has been minted and ‘not onenew note has been printed. It’s all an illusion. Banking is the mostprofitable and most destructive criminal activity on the planet. Peoplewho grow food and produce the necessities of life are up to their eyesin debt, and often pushed into bankruptcy and ruin by people who donothing more than type figures onto a computer screen and chargeinterest on them. Fantastic amounts of “money” are in circulation inthe form of cheques and credit of various kinds, but less than ten percent of it is in the form of coins and notes. More than ninety per centof it doesn’t exist. The system is massively bankrupt and it onlysurvives because people are conditioned into accepting cheques andcredit cards as “money” when, in fact, it is nothing more than an entryon a computer program with nothing whatsoever to back it up."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"35Staggeringly, this is how the vast majority of “money” is put intocirculation - not by governments printing cash, but by private bankslending money that doesn’t exist and charging interest on it. By creditin other words. This means that all but a fraction of the “money” usedto exchange for goods and services is created, right at the start, as adebt. We hear that inflation is caused by governments printing too muchmoney. No it’s not. Governments don’t print enough! Ninety per centof “money” released into circulation is “created” in the form of debtby the private banking network controlled by the Global Elite. It isutterly insane and no wonder the mountain of debt increases by theminute. An economic “boom” when production and consumptionincreases, simply leads to more borrowing from the banks to increasespending. So in the economic “good times”, the amount of debtincreases by colossal amounts and this eventually leads to the bad timesknown as depression. As the banks have control over the creation of“money” through loans, they decide if there is to be an economic boomor depression by increasing or decreasing the amount of “money” theyallow people to borrow. The difference between a boom and a bust isonly the amount of money available through cash or credit to makepurchases. As the banking system is controlled by the Global Elite, thistiny clique therefore have control over the economy of every countryand the decisions of the political and economic “leaders” who eitherdon’t understand how the banking system and money creation reallyworks (the majority) or are knowingly working with those who run thesystem. By this sleight of hand, the debts of people, businesses, andcountries have soared into never-never-land and the need to pay theinterest is reflected in the money we pay for taxation, food, warmth,clothing and shelter. The British Government spends far more oninterest charges per year than it does on education and once you realisehow the system works it is no longer surprising that the United Statesis trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.Look at what happens in one transaction alone. Say the USgovernment wants to borrow a billion dollars to cover its short fall inincome. It issues a Treasury note or bill, an IOU in other words, anddelivers it to the Federal Reserve, a cartel of private banks controlledby the Global Elite. The bankers then “create” a billion dollars atnegligible cost to them. At this point the banks begin to charge thegovernment (the people) interest on a billion dollars. Not only that, thepiece of paper, the IOU, is now counted as an “asset” of the banks andit appears in their accounts as if they actually own a billion dollars in"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36their coffers. This means that they can lend another ten billion dollars(at least) of non-existent “credit” to other customers!Everyone involved in a production process, be it the supplier of thematerials, the producer, the transportation company, the shop, etc... areall adding extra to their prices to cover their need to pay interest on thenon-existent money they have “borrowed”. By the time you buy aproduct in the shop, its price is massively inflated compared with whatit needs to be, because each stage in the process is servicing interestpayments on money that doesn’t exist. We are buying three houses forthe right to live in one because two thirds, sometimes more, of themoney we pay on a mortgage is interest on money that doesn’t exist. Ifyou take out a £50,000 loan to buy a house with Britain’s NationalWestminster Bank you will pay them back £152,000. You will buy threehouses to live in one. On the leaflet which revealed these figures, theyhad the nerve to say: The National Westminster Bank - we re here tomake life easier”. Thanks so much, I’m really grateful. All over theplanet are people doing things they have no desire to do because theyneed to pay interest on money that doesn’t exist. The Third World Debtwhich is crucifying billions of people by the day, is overwhelming debton money that has never, does not, and will never exist. And we standfor this!It is a con trick. It is not necessary. It is there to control us. That iswhy the system was created in the first place.Despite the obvious insanity of this legalised theft, our minds are stillconditioned to believe that charging interest on money is essential andwithout it the world economy would collapse. Not so. The globalbanking dictatorship orchestrated by the Global Elite would collapseand that would be fantastic. But people who are enslaved by payinginterest on money that doesn’t exist, defend the system and say it mustcontinue! Hey, prison warder, don’t you dare open that door, d’ya hear?The interest system is not a safeguard against economic suffering. Intruth the interest system creates poverty and inequality and allows theaccumulation of global power. Tell me this: what would happen if,instead of borrowing non-existent money from the private bankingnetwork, our governments printed their own money interest-free andlent it to the people interest-free with perhaps a very small one-off feeto cover administration costs? Would we no longer be able to buy allwe need? Yes, of course we would, and far more easily because thecost of everything would be less. The cost of a mortgage wouldplummet by two-thirds if you no longer had to pay interest. The"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"37homeless could be housed and we would not have the grotesque sightof people sleeping rough in the streets because they cannot gathertogether enough pieces of paper or non-existent computer figures topay for a proper shelter. Money would become what it was meant tobe, a means of exchanging contributions to the community whichsmooths out the limitations of barter. It is only when you have intereston money that it becomes the vehicle for control which is used withsuch devastating effect today. No-one gains from the payment ofinterest, except the banks of the Global Elite. No-one would lose out ifthe system were changed, except for the banking nexus and those whouse money to make money without any productive contribution to theworld. The banks which have plundered and abused humanity for solong would go under and the role of their successors would beconstructive rather than destructive. Is the demise of interest-chargingbanks really so terrible? I’m leaping for joy at the very thought. Thereis no reason why we cannot have interest-free money. It is only thewill that is missing because the politicians who could bring an end tointerest on money are controlled and manipulated by the same peoplewho own the global banking system which wields its power overpeople’s lives by demanding interest on money that doesn’t exist. Lookat the “different” political parties in your country. How many of themare proposing to end interest on money if they are voted into power?None? Thank you. And now you know why.Two presidents of the United States have proposed to print interest-free money and begun in a small way to introduce it. One was AbrahamLincoln and the other was John F Kennedy. What else do they have incommon?An important question to ask constantly is “who benefits?” Whenevera politician, economist, church leader, journalist, or anyone is tellingus what to think it is worth asking that question: who benefits from mebelieving what I am being asked to believe? The answer invariablyleads you to the real reason you are being fed that line of “thinking”.For example, who benefits from people believing that “far-rightmilitias” were behind the Oklahoma bomb? Those who wish todiscredit the militias’ claims about the Global Conspiracy and thosewho wish to justify the introduction of more authoritarian laws in theUnited States and, as President Clinton put it within 24 hours of thebomb: “an easing of restrictions on the military’s involvement indomestic law enforcement”.

When we do that, we:aallow a tiny Elite to decide our destiny, and that of our children;ballow this Elite to so programme our sense of limitation that welive at a fraction of our true potential;callow our minds to be manipulated minute by minute to see eventsand people in precisely the way the Elite desire;dallow a relative handful of bankers to control the finances of billionsof people by charging interest on money that doesn’t exist.When you give your mind away, you give your life away. When largenumbers of people do that, they give the world away. This is precisea’what we have done.The state of the world and the shape of own lives is not someoneelse’s “fault”. There is no-one to blame for what happens to us and ourfellow expressions of God. What I have briefly outlined here is of ourdoing. The manipulation and control I have described is our creation, areflection of the current state of human thought or non-thought. We areresponsible for what has occurred and continues to do so.If anyone is still in any doubt about the scale to which we haveconceded our destiny to a tiny clique, or of the deeply unbalancedmentality that motivates that clique, the next chapter will blow yourmind."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"39Chapter 4The Depths Of Evil I trust you’ll enjoy a few laughs as this book progresses becausehumour is so important. It is a wonderful antidote to fear and puts allthose events and areas of ours lives that make us frightened, controlour thinking, and cause us emotional pain into perspective. Whensubjected to humour, most things that we take seriously are shown tobe what they really are: utterly ludicrous.However, in this chapter there are no laughs. Some things are sogrotesque, so beyond the imagination of anyone within a thousandmiles of mental and emotional balance, that humour does not andcannot apply. In my years of speaking and writing about these spiritualand conspiratorial subjects I have resisted using the word evil. Evennow I emphasise that what we call “evil” is an extreme negativeimbalance in the consciousness and people in that mode can and dochange. “Evil” is not forever. It is for as long as those minds choose tostay in that state of being. But in the light, or rather the dark, of what Iam about to outline, the feel of that word evil seems so appropriate.Indeed we are talking the very depths of evil.People who desire to dominate the world and control the lives andthinking (same thing) of billions are seriously imbalanced. Many of themare psychopaths. It is vital to understand this if we are to appreciate howit is possible to coldly sit down and organise the manipulation of wars,famine, and disease, which bring untold suffering and misery to PlanetEarth. Nor does such a mental state manifest in only one aspect of theirbehaviour. It affects their entire being. Nothing confirms this more thanthe creation of human robots through mind-control and the almostunimaginable torture to which they are subjected.

It is howknowledge is used that is positive or negative. The same knowledgethat can create weapons of mass destruction can also be applied toproduce free energy technology which can provide all the power andwarmth we need at virtually no cost and no damage to the environment.So it is with what we call esoteric knowledge which some misguidedpeople dismiss and condemn as the “occult”, a word, incidentally,which merely means hidden. They brand this knowledge as the workof the devil. Others seem to believe, naively, that esoteric knowledgeis by its nature spiritual and of “the light.” It is neither good or bad, itjust is. It is only the knowledge of the nature of life and consciousness.It can be used to set the consciousness free from its self imposedlimitations of potential and perception, or it can be used to inspire thatvery sense of limitation and powerlessness.This knowledge, the themes of which are revealed in this book, is asold as creation and even in the desperately short period described bywhat we call recorded “history” it can be charted back to thousands ofyears BC to the civilisations of ancient Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, Greece,and every other culture across the world. Variations of this basic coreknowledge and its doctored and manipulated versions formed the basisof all the religions. They just changed the names, that’s all. The themes,claims, and ceremonies of Christianity, for example, originate in thecivilisations that long preceded the Christian dogma. The pre-Christianworld abounded with stories of virgin-born sons of God who died soour sins could be forgiven. The founder of Christianity, Saint Paul, wasreally called Saul of Tarsus. He was brought up in Asia Minor wherethey worshiped a “god” called Dionysus who was said to be virtuallyeverything that Paul later claimed for “Jesus”. Dionysus was said to bea son of God who died to save the world. “Saint” Paul replaced thename Dionysus with “Jesus” and gave him the same attributes andmyths. So Christianity was born and nearly two thousand years later itstill controls the minds, directly or indirectly, of billions today. It’s acon trick and no-one is more conned than most of the priests andchurchmen who promote it. For more details see The Robots’ Rebellion.Christianity was soon taken over by the forces of domination andturned into a vehicle of mass control. Anyone who expressed viewsthat challenged its manufactured nonsenses were systematicallyremoved, not least through the inquisition which burned as hereticsthose who were not seen as “true” Christians. The definition of “true”was to follow without question the doctrine imposed by the Pope. The"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"41esoteric knowledge, the basic truths of who we are, where we camefrom, and what we are doing here, has been hoarded by the few, in atwisted form, for at least thousands of years to keep the masses inignorance of these things. When Christianity was invented andcondemned the “occult” so violently, the knowledge was all buteliminated from the mass consciousness. As Christianity continued toexport its creed through death and destruction to the Americas, Africa,Australia, and so on, the esoteric knowledge was further lost as nativecultures were destroyed and “Christianised”. This was perfect for themanipulating force because they could now have a virtual monopolyon the knowledge and its potential to control and exploit because thepeople in general were either kept in ignorance or conditioned to seesuch knowledge as evil. One consequence of this was the mass tortureand murder of “witches”.The advanced levels of this knowledge had been passed on throughsecret initiation ceremonies to the chosen few in the Mystery Schoolsof Babylon, Egypt, Greece, etc, and certainly long before that incivilisations unrecorded by official history. As the centuries passed,and Christianity withdrew the knowledge from the public arena, thework of these Mystery Schools evolved into the massive secret societynetwork we see today which includes the Freemasons and the Knightsof Malta, both of which control the Pope and the Vatican. What awonderful way to direct and influence the behaviour of all thoseRoman Catholics worldwide. If a Pope does not play the game, he isremoved, as with the murder of Pope John Paul 1st, in 1978 (see ...and the truth shall set you free). The modern Freemasonic network isonly the ancient knowledge in the guise of a gentlemen’s club. At thetime of the Crusades, a number of “knights” organisations emerged,the most famous of which was the Knights Templar. They wore thesymbol of the red cross on the white background which symbolisedblood and semen and represented their knowledge of the power ofsexual energy, the creative force, be it positive or negative in its use.The Templars claimed to be a Christian organisation - a meresmokescreen for their secret knowledge and beliefs which originatedin ancient Egypt and before. They were purged by the Pope and theKing of France, but they continued to operate as an undergroundnetwork until they re-emerged publicly as.. .the Freemasons. This isthe same organisation, the Knights Templar under another name, anda major tool for the Global Elite’s manipulation of the world.

He wasn’tlooking for India only to find the West Indies. He knew exactly wherehe was going because he had the maps that had been been passed onthrough the secret society network, of which he was a member (see ...and the truth shall set you free). The existence of America was knownabout long before it was officially “discovered”. History has just beenwritten to suppress this fact and all the questions that would emergefrom it. Those given the knowledge in the initiation ceremonies aresaid to be “illuminated” and this gave birth to the name of a leadingforce within the conspiracy, the Illuminati.So here we are in the modern world with a network of secret societieswhich, at the peak of the pyramid, are all the same organisation workingwith the same knowledge to the same end - control of the world. Ofcourse, most of their membership have no idea that this is the casebecause they never progress beyond the lowest levels of initiation andare therefore kept in ignorance of what they are involved with. As I’vealready emphasised, the people who go to their local Freemasons lodgeand roll up their trouser leg are the frontmen, the veil, for what is reallygoing on at the top. The initiation ceremonies are pretty black andbizarre even at the lower levels and they become more and more so thehigher you go. One infamous and sinister secret society within thenetwork is the Skull and Bones Society based at Yale University in theUnited States. The skull and crossbones flag was also a Templar flag.At the Skull and Bones Society headquarters known, appropriately, asthe Tomb, carefully selected students are initiated and, surprise,surprise, so many of them end up in positions of power. George Bush,the President of the United States for three terms of office (includingthe two officially credited to Ronald Reagan) is a Skull and Bonesmember. He, like all the rest, would have been initiated by lying nakedin a coffin with a ribbon tied to his willy while he masturbated andshouted out details of his sexual exploits. I don’t have a problem withanyone doing anything so long as they don’t force it on other people.Everyone to their own. But this is not just a group of people choosingto stimulate themselves sexually in ways that turn them on. It goes way,way beyond that.A question I am constantly, and understandably, asked is: “Who arethese people who control the top of the pyramid?” The answer is thatthey are the chosen few who are initiated into the highest levels of thesecret society network through which all the other areas of society,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"43banking, business, politics, media intelligence agencies, the military,and “education”, are controlled by ensuring that representatives of thenetwork are appointed to the major posts or string-pull the people inthose posts.

At the Elite levels there are also a number of families,induding the Rockefellers and the House of Rothschild, from whommany of the Elite are selected in each generation.

You might take a step back in amazement and incredulitywhen first reading all this, but unfortunately it is true. This is the Satanicstate of mind which currently calls the shots on Planet Earth and thatexplains so much about what goes on here. The All Seeing Eye. at thepeak of the pyramid is symbolic of this highly negative consciousnesswhich is known under many different names and guises throughout theworld religions and ancient legends. The Egyptians, for instance, calledthis force “Set”.The knowledge of how to manipulate human consciousness,collectively and individually, has been accumulated and passed on likea baton for thousands of years at the highest levels of the secret societynetwork and so now this knowledge is vast. It is used to manipulate usthrough information management and advertising via the careful useof key words and phrases, sounds, colours, hypnosis, and symbols, thelatter of which fundamentally affect the psyche. This is why thesymbols used today by this network are exactly the same ones that wereused and held sacred in the ancient world. The Nazi swastika is anancient esoteric symbol which, in its original form, is positive. But theNazis turned it around to symbolise the negative. Just looking atsymbols can have a powerful effect on the mind and the Nazis knewthat. The whole Nazi movement was based on sinister secret societiesand the abuse of esoteric knowledge. They were Satanists because they,too, were connected to the cult of the All Seeing Eye. So were thehierarchy controlling the Americans, French, British, and Russians, who“opposed” them!As I have shown in other books, the ability to turn someone into arobot by mind programming has been understood for a very long timeand it is becoming more sophisticated and advanced with every year.Much knowledge was taken to the United States after the Second WorldWar by the Nazi mind-controllers and geneticists who were spirited outof Germany after 1945 by a British-American intelligence operationknown as Operation Paperdip. Like I say, the Nazi mentality did notend in 1943, it merely donned white coats and business suits. Peopleusing the esoteric knowledge positively are able to “hear” psychicguidance and see other dimensions. Others are able to leave their bodiesand experience those dimensions in a non-physical state; to tune theirconsciousness into the “future”, as with Nostradamus; and to projectpowerful thought forms which affect the world positively.

Some of them areabducted by the Elite-controlled “intelligence” agencies and theiroffshoots and used for Nazi-style genetic experimentation and mind-control projects. Many, yes at least many, of the people who talk ofbeing abducted by “aliens” and taken into spaceships forexperimentation have actually been abducted by humans. Abductingsomeone, wiping their mind of that memory, and replacing it with ahypnotic suggestion that they were abducted by “aliens” is child’s playtoday to these people working in the secret military and scientificestablishments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and aroundthe world. When those people become conscious they genuinely believethey were abducted by “aliens” when, in fact, it was really a verypowerful hypnotic suggestion. Many are also found to have beenimpregnated with microchips. The fear of extraterrestrial “aliens” isanother aspect of the manipulation of human perception on the road tototal control. They are planning to “reveal” details of an extraterrestrial“invasion” of the Earth to justify the immediate creation of a worldgovernment and army. Ahhh! Save us from the aliens! We are alreadybeing conditioned for this and the UFO investigation network is beingused to spread this disinformation, as is Hollywood through films likeIndependence Day. I can picture the scene now. The US President withstern face and ominous tone announces that knowledge ofextraterrestrial activity has been suppressed for decades to avoid globalpanic. But now the situation is so grave that the world has to be told ofthe imminent threat of an extraterrestrial invasion. The only way tomeet this threat, we will be told, is to forget our differences and cometogether as “one” (world government and world army). That is not to"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"46say that I reject the idea of abductions by extraterrestrials, nor that theyplay a significant part in the manipulation of this world. I believe theydo. The point I wish to emphasise is that this situation can be used todupe us into accepting things we would not normally accept so readily,such as a world army, government and so on. I am increasinglyconvinced that far from invading the Earth today, the extraterrestrialshave been here for thousands of years at least, and in many forms. Mynext book will include more details on this.One method of creating human robots is called Multiple PersonalityDisorder (MPD), also known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).This involves compartmentalising a person’s mind into a series ofprogrammed “personalities”, each of which is triggered by a word,sentence, sound or action. Each compartment of the mind isunconnected to the others. So one minute you are operating in a certain“personality” and the next, after the trigger word or action, you lockinto another. It’s like moving a dial on the radio and picking up anotherstation. What’s more, unless you are skillfully deprogrammed, youdon’t remember anything as the “dial” keeps moving. It is exactly thesame principle as compartmentalising the global pyramid in the way Idescribed earlier. Even this technique is primitive compared with thelatest methods. People, or rather zombies, in a programmed state areused for many things. They are activated to carry out assassinations, aswith the killers ofJohn Lennon and Robert Kennedy. This is why somany assassinations are performed by people with the same mentalprofile - the so called “lone nutters.” They are neither alone nor, in mostcases, insane if they were allowed to live in their natural state. Theyare programmed beings, often, as we shall see, since childhood. By thismethod, you can, for instance, plant a terrorist bomb and ensure thatthe person you want to be blamed for it is in the right place at the righttime for him to be accused and charged with the outrage. You can alsoprogramme that person’s mind while in custody to ensure that he eventhinks he was involved. The infamous CIA mind-controller called DrLewis Jolyn “Jolly” West, who features strongly in ... and the truth shallset you free, has, it appears, been working with Timothy McVeigh, theThere is speculation about whether the mind-controlled Sirhan Sirhan actually delivered thefatal shots in the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the brother of JFK, in 1968. But he wascertainly there with a gun and this allowed him to be jailed for the murder while the realkiller and those who arranged the programming got away with it. See ... and the truth shallset you free."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"47microchipped former US soldier who is accused of the Oklahomabombing. West was involved with the appalling US Government mind-control project known as MKUltra and one of his keenest supporterswas the then Governor of California, later President of the UnitedStates, Ronald Reagan.We have also seen a spate of “lone nutters” in a number of countrieswho commit mass murder by going apparently crazy with guns. Inthe United Kingdom we have had horrific examples of this in the littletowns of Hungerford in Berkshire and Dunblane in Scotland. A“nutter” called Thomas Hamilton walked into a school in Dunblaneand opened fire on little children in the gymnasium. The affect on thecollective psyche of hundreds of millions of people across the world,especially, of course, in the UK, was devastating. Shortly after thatcame the massacre in Port Arthur, a small town in Tasmania,Australia, when another lone gunmen went “crazy.” This wasfollowed in England by a guy attacking children and their teacherswith a machete at a school in Wolverhampton. What goes on here?Look at the profiles of such people. They have a “background” ofbeing a bit strange or “simple” - “not the full quid” as neighboursdescribed the Port Arthur killer, Martin Bryant. This is perfect whenyou want them and their horrors to be dismissed as the work of alone nutter. In Bryant’s case he had just returned from a two weekstay in the United States when he went beserk with his gun. Peopleclose to him said his character had changed after he came back fromthe US. It has been shown that terrorist groups like the IRA have whatthey call “sleepers”, people who lie low unused for years, evendecades, until circumstances arrive in which they and their cover canbe exploited for a particular task. It is the same in this world of mind-control. There are people programmed to live in the community witha certain character profile until the time comes when they can be used.They are known in the “trade” as “dead eyes”. They have no ideathat they are being used in this way because they are not in control oftheir minds, their programmers are. There are so many unansweredquestions, interestingly, about why the Dunblane killer, ThomasHamilton, was allowed to legally keep guns when his strangebehaviour should have ensured his licence was refused. And why didthe police in Port Arthur take an hour to respond when the scene ofthe massacre was close to the police station and they had beeninformed within minutes of Bryant’s first shots? Also, Bryant,Hamilton and so many other people who go crazy in this way are"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"48reportedly taking the drug Prozac, a widely prescribed anti-depressantproduced by Eli Lilly, a company closely connected to George Bush.Side effects include nervousness, anxiety, suicidal tendencies,hypomania and violent behaviour when the drug is withdrawn.Doctors are warned not to prescribe Prozac to anyone with a historyof “mania”.So what is the motivation behind such massacres? Answer: Themanipulation of the mind and emotions. Where did these massmurders take place? Not in the gangland areas of London, Glasgow,or Sydney, but in quiet little communities where everyone feltperfectly safe. In the same way, the “McVeigh” bomb was not plantedin New York or Washington, but in Oklahoma. We would be advisednot to underestimate the effect on the collective psyche in terms offear and a desire for the authorities to “protect” people from that fear.That means more cameras in the streets and more security guards andcameras in schools so that children are brought up to accept the cultureof being “protected” from danger by big brother authority. A front pageheadline in, I think, the London Daily Mail encompassed the veryreaction the manipulators wanted to stimulate. It said after theAustralia killings: Is nowhere in the world safe anymore? When thesethings happen in quiet communities, it encourages even morepowerfully the response of “My God, this could happen to me and mychildren. Hey, we need protection”. A traumatised mind is also farmore susceptible to mind manipulation. The Global Elite also want toremove all guns from the general population in preparation for theirfinal coup d’etat. No-one wants to rid the world of weapons more thanme, but we need to ask about the motivation behind the immensepressure for gun laws inspired by... Hungerford, Dunblane, Tasmania,Oklahoma, etc, etc. Problem-reaction-solution. Getting hold of illegalweapons is so easy that gun laws would not stop anyone who reallywanted to kill. The gun used by Martin Bryant in Port Arthur wasstolen and he had no licence. Gun laws would, however, prevent thepopulation from defending itself from the HIGs - the Hoodlums InGovernment, as the scientist Wilhelm Reich used to call them. Iwouldn’t use a gun to save my life. I don’t see the point of usingviolence to oppose violence, but many people would and the Eliteknow that. Hence they want an unarmed population. Adolf Hitlerintroduced gun laws shortly before he began to transport people to hisconcentration camps. Similar camps or “holding facilities” havealready been built in the United States by an organisation called"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"49FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was setup by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the man who launched the TrilateralCommission with David Rockefeller.Mind-controlled human robots are also used to pass messagesbetween people outside the normal channels. These include unofficialcommunications between world leaders and between personnel withinthe Global Elite-CIA controlled illegal drugs network which involvespresidents of the United States and many other world leaders andofficials. People programmed through Multiple Personality Disorderapparently develop a photographic memory. The words of thecommunication are dictated under a form of hypnosis and thencompartmentalised, often using a high voltage stun gun which lowersblood sugar levels and makes the person more open to suggestion. Latera trigger word, sentence, or action, activates that personality and thehuman robot repeats the message word for word like a recorded tape. Ihave no doubt that some world leaders are themselves under theinfluence of mind-control by their handlers and I am convinced that awell known politician in the UK, with his distant eyes and fixed smile,is under some sort of mental influence and controlled by one of hismost prominent “spin doctors”.Most sickeningly, the robots, including very small children, are usedto provide bizarre sex for presidents, foreign leaders, politicians, andbusinessmen who the Elite either wish to encourage into their way ofthinking or to compromise and blackmail into doing as they are told.When I say bizarre, I mean it, and I don’t find the information thatfollows easy to write or speak about. But it is so important that thisveil is lifted, not least for those who are being subjected now, thisminute, to some of the grotesque evil that I shall expose. For the mostobvious of reasons these human robots are rarely able to talk aboutwhat has happened to them. They are either in zombie mode and can’tremember or, when they are passed their sell-by date from themanipulators’ perspective, they are murdered and sometimes their bodyparts are used for the unspeakable black magic rituals often attendedby some very famous people. You think you know the personalities ofpeople you see on the television? Please read on. Fortunately, one verybrave woman who was mind-controlled as a young child has nowspoken out after escaping from US government slavery. She was takenthrough long and painstaking deprogramming sessions lasting morethan a year which broke down the compartments in her mind andallowed her to remember everything that happened to her - and who"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50did it. She is Cathy O’Brien, an American of Irish decent, who hasproduced a self-published book about her experiences called Trance-Formation Of America.2 It is a stunning tale she has to tell. But therehave been thousands, probably millions, more like her - still are -andthat will continue to be the case until humanity wakes up to itsresponsibilities. Because of her photographic memory, Cathy candescribe in great detail the conversations she heard, the rooms anddecor in the White House, the Pentagon and top secret militaryestablishments across the US. She can also describe physical details ofthe people involved which she could only know if she had seen themnaked.Catlileen (Cathy) Ann O’Brien was born in 1957 in MuskegorMichigan. Her father Earl O’Brien is a paedophile and one of Cathy’sfirst memories was being unable to breathe because his t)enis was inher mouth. Such trauma automatically triggers Multiple Per onalityDisorder without any need for programming because the child’s ownmind wishes to shut out the horror. It compartmental’ses the experiencein the same way that people can’t remember road accidents they areinvolved in. Her father’s friends were also allowed to abuse and rapethe young Cathy and her brothers, just as her father and mother hadbeen abused as children. Her mother was sexually abused by Cathy’sgrandfather, the leader of a Masonic Blue Lodge. Her nother’s brother,“Uncle Bob” to Cathy, was a pilot in Airforce Intelligence who claimedthat he worked for the Vatican. “Uncle Bob” who is also a commercialpornographer and Cathy’s father forced her and I r older brother, Bill,to take part in pornographic films made for the local Michigan Mafiawhich was connected, she says, to the “Porn King” Gerald Ford, then aUS Representative. He would later be the Vice President of the UnitedStates under Richard Nixon and President when Nixon was ousted byWatergate, an outcome inspired by the Washington Post, owned byKatherine Graham (Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, Councilon Foreign Relations). Ford also served on the Warren Commission“investigating” the assassination of President Kennedy. While CathyO’Brien was a little child at school, she says she was raped by GeraldFord in the office of Michigan State Senator, Guy VanderJagt, who alsoraped her. VanderJagt would become the chairman of the Republican2 Trance-Formation Of America is available from Brigadoon Books, 1The Old Bakery, MillStreet, Aberfeldy, Perthshire PH15 2BT, Scotland or from Bridge of Love, c/o 13553 PowayRoad, #170 Poway, California 92064, USA"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"51Party National Congressional Committee which supported GeorgeBush, another child rapist named in Cathy’s book, in his successfulcampaign to become President of the United States.Eventually, Cathy’s father, it appears, was caught sending childpornography through the post - a film of young Cathy having sex witha boxer dog. To avoid prosecution Cathy was, in effect, handed overby her father to the United States Government and the DefenseIntelligence Agency. Her father was delighted with the deal becausehe was now immune from prosecution and could continue hispornography and paedophile activities while the authorities looked theother way. The Agency was searching for sexually abused childrenwith Multiple Personality Disorder who came from families with ahistory of intergenerational child abuse. They wanted the children fortheir studies into genetic mind-control which operated under the titleProject Monarch, an offshoot of the notorious, MKUltra. (I understandthat MK stands for Mind Kontrolle - the German spelling of Kreplacing the C in deference to the Nazis, formerly serving underHitler, who inspired the project.) The man who arrived at Cathy’shouse to give her father the ultimatum of hand over your daughter orbe prosecuted was... Gerald Ford. Cathy’s father was sent to HarvardUniversity near Boston to be instructed in how to prepare his daughterfor the mad professors of the Government agencies. Cathy says in herbook:... in keeping with his government-provided instructions, my fatherbegan working me like the legendary Cinderella. I shovelled fireplaceashes, hauled and stacked firewood, raked leaves, shovelled snowchopped ice, and swept - ‘because’, my father said, ‘your little handsfit so nicely around the rake, mop, shovel, and broom handles...’ By thistime my father’s exploitation of me included prostitution to his friends,local mobsters and Masons, relatives, Satanists, strangers, and policeofficers...... Government researchers involved in MKUltra Project Monarchknew about the photographic memory aspect of MPD/DID, of course,as well as other resultant ‘5uper human’ characteristics. Visual acuityof an MPD/DID is 44 times greater than that of the average person.My developed unusually high pain threshold, plus compartmentalisationof memory, were ‘necessary’ for military and covert operationsapplications.

Slavery is happening all overthe world today, including, no especially, in the United States and other“civilised” countries like the United Kingdom. The paedophile ringsmake the news from time to time, but they are the tiniest tip of a vastnetwork that goes right to the top (sorry gutter) of “free” societies. Thetruth about the abuse of boys at the Kincora Home in Northern Irelandwas suppressed because one of the abusers was an agent of BritishIntelligence. It also involved at least one famous politician in NorthernIreland, but this fact has been covered up, not least by a now retiredofficial of British Intelligence called Ian Cameron. Such child abusenetworks provide the perfect vehicle to satisfy the sexual desires ofthose in control and for blackmailing those they wish to control. I wantthe names of those involved in whatever country you live in. If youknow something, please tell me. The information will be in the strictestconfidence and if it can be substantiated I will make it public. If youhesitate, just think about the children.Cathy O’Brien says she was abused by Father James Thaylen whenshe sought comfort at a Roman Catholic Church called St. Francis deSales in Muskegon and another priest, a Father Don, was a paedophilewho helped Gerald Ford’s friend, Guy Vanderjagt, to confuse and abuseher in line with the “requirements” of Project Monarch. Later she wassent to a Roman Catholic School, one of many used by the governmentto safely house their mind-controlled children under the strict regimedesigned to increase the depth of their Multiple Personality Disorder.Her school was Muskegon Catholic Central High School where shewas raped by Father Vesbit many times, on one occasion during aSatanic ritual involving other mind-controlled boys and girls in hisprivate chapel. The Roman Catholic Church is the epitome of hypocrisyand deeply, deeply sick. The “Roman Catholic” Jesuit movement is animportant vehicle for the manipulation of the global conspiracy and,like the Knights of Malta who help to control the Vatican, it does noteven believe in Christianity! That’s just a front. The whole conspiracyis masks, smoke, and mirrors. The Jesuits, the Knights of Malta, andthe Roman Catholic hierarchy are part of the Illuminati - the Illuminated3 Trance-Formation Qf America, p83"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"53Ones. They were, and are, keen supporters of mind-control outrageslike Project Monarch and MKUltra. How appropriate given that theRoman Catholic Church has survived only by terrifying, brainwashing,and mind-controlling its global congregation. One Jesuit front for theconspiracy is the “charity”, World Vision. Cathy was pressured andmanipulated by the CIA’s Roman Catholic branch into keeping secretsfrom a young age through a technique known as the kite to RemainSilent and there were so many secrets to keep locked away in hercompartmentalised mind. In the years that followed she says she wasunder the control of the US “Democrat” Senator for West Virginia,Robert C. Byrd, and her abuse by him and the government agenciesexpanded. Byrd is a “constitutional” expert working to undermine anddestroy the American Constitution. She claims that Byrd controls anetwork of mind-controlled slaves and loves nothing more than to whipthem mercilessly until they are close to death.4 One of Byrd’sassociates, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would later torture Cathyby putting a needle in her eye while her daughter, Kelly, was forced towatch. Leahy was vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committeeand served on Byrd’s Senate Appropriations Committee. Leahy andByrd played out a public game of “opposing” each other while actuallyworking together to the same goals. The same masquerade goes on inthe parliaments of the world. Byrd, a cocaine addict,5 often bragged to“safe” people of how he mind-controlled President Jimmy Carter whilehe was Carter’s “confidant and advisor”. The hypnotic voice of Byrdbecame the “voice of God” to a praying and meditating Carter whofaithfully followed the “guidance” he believed was divine.6 Rememberwhat I said about the mind-influenced UK politician?Cathy’s torture and mind-control was inflicted at many governmentestablishments around the States, including the NASA Space andRocket Centre at Huntsville, Alabama, where she and, later, herdaughter, Kelly, were used for pornographic films. Yes, “man-on-themoon”, “space shuttle”, NASA does all this. Religions are usedconstantly to manipulate people and as a “respectable” cover for tortureand mind manipulation. One centre of Cathy’s mind programming wasSalt Lake City, Utah, the headquarters of the Mormon “Church”.4 Trance-Formation Of America, p 915 Contact newspaper, The Phoenix Project, February 7th 1995, p17.6 Ibid p 18."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"54Another establishment for mind-controlling slaves is known as the“Charm School” at Youngstown, Ohio. This is a “sex slave” training“school” where Cathy, Kelly, and a stream of other women and childrenwere (are) tortured and abused with electric shocks, sleep deprivation,and sexual trauma. Cathy says an unnamed member of the Mellonbanking family was the “governor” of the Charm School and other wellknown people involved were US Representative, Jim Traficant, andDick Thornburgh, then Governor for Pennsylvania and later USAttorney General and Secretary for the United Nations.7While still a child, Cathy was raped, abused, and tortured, by somevery famous people. She says that she was raped by Pierre Trudeau,the long-time prime minister of Canada who, as a Jesuit, was workingclosely with the Vatican; raped again by Gerald Ford when he wasactually President; raped by Ronald Reagan while he was President;and raped many times in the most brutal fashion by Dick Cheney, theWhite House Chief of Staff under Ford and the Defense Secretary ofthe United States under George Bush. Cathy is able to describeCheney’s office in the Pentagon in great detail. If you accept Cathy’shighly detailed evidence you can only conclude that Cheney, like Bush,is an immensely imbalanced mind capable of staggering violence andeven murder. Cathy says that Cheney told her on one occasion: “I couldkill you - kill you - with my bare hands. You’re not the first and youwon’t be the last.”8 These were the characters who launched the GulfWar to show that “violence does not pay”! Cheney, Bush, and othershave “fun” playing something they call A Most Dangerous Game,Cathy documents. It involves threatening government slaves like Cathyand other mind-controlled children and adults with appallingconsequences if they are caught in the game. They are then allowed to“escape” into a forest, usually in some top secret military area likeLampe, Missouri, and Mount Shasta, California, which are surroundedby a high fence to prevent any escape. George Bush, the man whocalled for a “kinder, gentler, America”, Dick Cheney and Bill Clintonoften go after them with guns, Cathy writes in her book. When theyare caught, they are brutally raped, sometimes killed. Ladies andgentlemen, these are the people we allow to control the world. TheMount Shasta compound, where Bush and Cheney shared an office, is,according to Cathy: “The largest, covert mind-control slave camp of7 Trance-Formation Of America, p115.8 Ibid p100."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"55which I am aware.”9There she saw an enormous fleet of unmarkedblack helicopters, which, as researchers have revealed, are part of theNew World Order’s private army which is being installed to instigatethe coup d’etat when the moment is deemed right. These helicoptershave often been reported near the scenes of “alien abductions” andcattle mutilations. Part of the cover for these military and mind-controloperations at the Shasta Compound, Cathy says, is the country musicscene at Lake Shasta.Cathy was forced to marry a mind-controlled Satanist called WayneCox, a member of the Jack Greene country music band. Greene, a CIAoperative, was also a Satanist.10 Cox’s job was to further traumatiseher to create more compartments which could be used to programmenew “personalities:’ One night, Cox took Cathy with him to the ruinsof the Union Railway Station in Nashville and, using a flashlight, founda homeless man asleep. He ordered Cathy to “Kiss the railroad bumgood-bye” and proceeded to shoot him in the head. That was horrificenough, but he then produced a machete and chopped off the man’shands before putting them into a zipper bag.11 As Cathy has stated atpublic meetings many times, Wayne Cox is a serial killer whoinvariably chops off the hands of his prey. In an interview published inthe Contact newspaper, Cathy said:“By 1978, Wayne Cox, my first designated controller, was activelyritually murdering and dismembering bums, children, and those who‘wouldn’t be missed’ and blatantly distributing body parts from hisChatham, Louisiana home base to key Satanic capitals of several stateswhich included the Little Rock /Missouri route. “12Government agencies know this, but he is immune from prosecutionbecause he works for them. Cox led Cathy to another spot on the UnionStation site, a tower at the old railroad depot, and waiting in a room forthem was Jack Greene, members of his band and others, dressed inblack robes. They were standing around a black leather altar. The roomwas draped in red velvet and lit by candles. Cathy was laid on the alterand subjected to rape and torture while the Satanists performed a black9 Trance-Formation Of America, p194.10 Ibid p101.11 Ibid.12 Contact newspaper, March 7th 1995, p33."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"56magic ritual that involved sex, blood, and cannibalism.13 Years laterwhen “married” to another CIA asset, Alex Houston, she would bemade pregnant and artificially aborted many times so the foetus couldbe used for Satanic rituals. My friends, this is going on all over theworld and it involves some of the best known people on the planet.There is a sexual “playground” for leading American and foreignpoliticians, mobsters, etc, involved in the Cult of the All Seeing Eyeand the New World Order. It is called Bohemian Grove in NorthernCalifornia and here Cathy was forced to serve their perversions. Theseinclude Satanic rituals, torture, sacrifices, and drinking blood. No, I’mnot kidding. Regular attenders of this Satanic centre are known as“Grovers” and people like Clinton, Bush and Ford are among them,Cathy says. Other researchers have linked Henry Kissinger withBohemian Grove. All that I am describing is founded on the abuse ofesoteric knowledge - black magic - and the constant sexual themerelates to the power of sexual energy, which I will explain in a laterchapter. The global Satanic network is also a pyramid with the GlobalElite and the Cult of the All Seeing Eye at the peak. These people are,in turn, under the domination of the “Lucifer”/”Satan” consciousnesswhich controls its “personnel” through mind and emotional possession.The Satanic child abuse rings which are all too rarely exposed are, infact, part of a coordinated global network that goes to the top of thepyramid. This is why so many world leaders are involved in Satanicchild abuse. The Cult of the All Seeing Eye is based on Satanism andthe black use of esoteric knowledge and this same cult controls theappointments to the major political, economic, and administrative postsin the world. Therefore you find that a staggeringly high proportion ofpeople in the top jobs are people connected to this cult and its sexualabuses. The best actors are in Hollywood? No, no, they are in theparliaments and political parties.One of those who controlled Cathy O’Brien was Lt Colonel MichaelAquino of the US Army, a top man in the Defense Intelligence Agency’sPsychological Warfare Division. I have named him in my last twobooks as the head of a “Satanic church”14 known as the Temple of Set,an organisation inspired, apparently, by the leader of Hitler’s SS,13 Trance-Formation Of America, p10114 Cathy says that Aquino does not himself believe in “Satan”. He believes Satan is merelythe ability to mind-control. But what is it that motivates his mind to act in such ways?"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"57Heinrich Himmler. When it was exposed that America’s PsychologicalWarfare was being headed by a Neo-Nazi from a “Satanic” church, theofficial response was that a man’s religion was his own business!! But,as Cathy soon found out, people like Aquino and the rest of this deeplydisturbed and possessed bunch are above the law, because theirmentality controls the law right up to the president and beyond. PlanetEarth is possessed by an extreme negative consciousness and thesepeople are merely the physical expression of that. Again, later in thebook, I will discuss the source of this consciousness represented by theAll Seeing Eye.Cathy conceived a child, Kelly, with her “husband”, Wayne Cox, andsoon Kelly was being used in the same way as her mother. Cathy saysthat Kelly was raped many times by George Bush and Dick Cheneyand both mother and daughter were forced to have sex with animalsfor videos made on the orders of President Ronald Reagan. “UncleRon” liked nothing more than to watch these videos and they wereknown as “Uncle Ronnie’s bedtime stories”.15 They were recorded andproduced, Cathy says, by his pornographer, Michael Dante’ (alsoknown as Michael Viti). Dante’ had connections with the Mafia andthe CIA (same thing, mostly), and was a close associate of politicianslike Guy VanderJagt, Gerald Ford, Dick Thornburgh, then Governor ofPennsylvania, Jim Traficant, and Gary Ackerman.16 It was Dant& whoinstalled the tiny hidden cameras which recorded the sexual activitiesof US and foreign politicians so they could be blackmailed intosupporting the New World Order. How many “leaders” today arefollowing certain policies against the interests of the people because ifthey didn’t the evidence of their sexual exploits would be revealed?Reagan’s leading pornographer was a man called Larry Flynt who ranthe pornography magazine, Hustler.17 He, too, had CIA, Mafia andVatican connections.18Bill Clinton was compromised in this way on one occasion by hisboss, oops, sorry, “opponent”, George Bush. It happened at the Lampe,Missouri, mind-control facility known as Swiss Villa. Bush orderedKelly to perform oral sex on Clinton while Clinton was doing the samewith Cathy. She recalls the following exchange:15 Trance-Formation Of America, p127.16 Ibid, p128.17 Ibid, pill.18 Ibid, p162."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"58“Clinton pushed his way out from under me, and told Bush while heglanced around for the camera: ‘You didn’t need to do that. I’m withyou anyway. My position does not need to be compromised.’ Clintonwas apparently referring to the blackmail tactics amongst the Order ofthe Rose [All Seeing Eye] Elite. World leaders were alwayscompromised through covertly filmed bizarre sexual activity as was myexperience at the Bohemian Grove.After this encounter, Bush and Clinton discussed introducingClinton’s daughter, Chelsea, to the child abuse scene. Bush offered toopen her up”. Clinton said he would have to discuss it with Hillary.20Cathy says that she and Kelly were also raped by another CanadianPrime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who is addicted to sex with mind-controlled slaves.21 Mind-controlled mothers and young daughters were(are?) regularly transported to Niagara Falls just across the Canadianborder for Mulroney to rape them.22 It was Mulroney in his period asprime minister who forced upon the Canadian people, the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is set to become theAmerican version of the European Union. The Agreement wasmanipulated into existence by his fellow child rapist, George Bush, andlater by Bill Clinton. Under the orders of President Reagan’s personalattache’, Philip Habib, Cathy says she was forced to have sex on severaloccasions with the New World Order stooge, King Fahd of SaudiArabia. The Saudi “royal family” serve as puppets of the Global Elitewhile suppressing their people with a brutal religion which they,themselves, do not even begin to observe. American mind-controlledslaves are also “sold” to Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and other countries tohelp fund the covert operations of the Cult of the All Seeing Eye.Cathy was so powerfully mind-controlled that she was “promoted”to become what is known as a Presidential Model, a mind-controlledslave who is detailed to operate with the top people in the White House.She was used to pass messages between Reagan, Bush, and theirforeign associates such as the dictators, Baby Doc Duvalier of Haiti,President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico, and Manuel Noriega ofPanama, a paid CIA operative working for the US Government’s illegal19 Contact newspaper, September 12th 1995, p15.20 Ibid.21 Trance-Formation Of America, p183.22 Ibid p178."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"59drug trade. As I have explained in detail in previous books, Bill Clintonand George Bush are both drug addicts involved in running drugs on amassive scale. Clinton is addicted to cocaine while Bush’s preferreddrug is heroin. Gerald Ford is another drug runner. These facts areconfirmed by Cathy’s direct experiences. The world market in illegaldrugs is controlled by the White House and the US/global intelligence/organised crime network to make vast amounts of money for covertoperations designed to implement the global domination of the NewWorld Order and to destabilise society to make people easier to control.Noriega was closely involved with this during the Reagan-Bush yearsand it was only when Noriega and Bush fell out that Bush sent UStroops into Panama to remove him. Bush replaced him in Panama withanother character connected to the South American drug trade andNoriega was taken to the United States to be jailed for drug offences!Cathy observed one “party” attended by Air Force officials and theirwives, drug barons like the Pueto Rican, Jose Busto, and the “hero” (Ifeel ill) of the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms scandal, Oliver North. Largeamounts of cocaine were laid out for their use.

In the midst of Clinton’s “war ofdrugs”, he ended drugs tests for White House staff because so many ofhis associates running the country were also addicts! I’m going to wakeup in a minute, I’m sure of it. Cathy met Clinton a few times and onone occasion in Arkansas he was trying (successfully) to persuade asupporter, Bill Hall, to become involved in the drug trade. Hall neednot worry, Clinton said, because it was “Reagan’s operation”. Clintontold Hall in Cathy’s then mind-controlled presence:“Bottom line is, we’ve got control of the (drug) industry, thereforewe’ve got control of them (suppliers and buyers). You control the guyunderneath you and Uncle (Uncle Sam, the United States Government)has you covered. What have you got to lose? No risk. No-one’s going tohang you out to dry.

There Mrs Clinton, anothercocaine user,25 performed oral sex on Cathy and then insisted it wasdone to her.26 Both President Clinton and his “first” lady knew Cathywas a mind-controlled slave and they know what is going on. Theykeep quiet because they are part of what is going on. Cathy acted as arobotic messenger for Clinton who was very adept at triggering herprogramming, as she has stated publicly many times. Bob Dole knowswhat is going on, too, and yet nothing is done.Clinton and Bush may seem to be opponents in “different” politicalparties, but they are part of the same scam, the New World Order. CathyO’Brien has confirmed from her own direct experience whatresearchers have been suggesting for years: Bush was President duringthe “Reagan” years, President through his own “official” period in theOval Office, and pulled the strings again during the “Clinton” regime.Bush was born into the Cult of the All Seeing Eye. His father, PrescottBush, helped to fund Adolf Hitler.27 These two “opponents”, GeorgeBush (CFR, TC, 33rd degree Freemason, All Seeing Eye) and BillClinton (CFR, TC, Bil, 33rd degree Freemason, All Seeing Eye) are onthe same side, involved in the same rackets. At the 4992 election thetwo “opposed” each other to present the illusion of a “democratic”society. Cathy met Bush and Clinton together years before Clinton waseven considered a presidential possible. She once observed them atSwiss Villa at Lampe, Missouri. The “infirmary” on the site is home toa CIA near-death trauma centre. Cathy, under her mind-control, haddelivered a large amount of cocaine there in a motorhome when shesaw the two future presidents:..... I noticed then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at a cornertable with Hillary talking to the then Vice-President George Bush, andtheir two special forces “toy soldiers” (mind-controlled) who hadtransferred the cocaine to the infirmary building.

Bush and Clinton were dressed alike in camouflage pants, army bootsand wind breakers. The two also shared the trademark of wearing acap of cryptic meaning. This time, Bush’s camouflage cap had anorange insignia that said ‘Dear Hunter’. Clinton’s blue cap read ‘AimHigh’ and had a picture of a rifle on it. Clinton appeared awkward withhis hunting rifle, while Bush looked like an expert marksman with hisblack rifle with elaborate scope.“‘The rules of the game are simple’ Bush began, triggering me byusing the same words that always preceded a Most Dangerous Game.“Clinton interrupted ‘You run. We hunt.’“Bush continued: ‘This will be called “Hunt for a virgin” (Clintonchuckled) and she’s it.’ He pointed to Kelly who was still in my arms.

America is a one party fascist dictatorship whilemillions of Americans go on believing it is the land of the free.When the slaves outlive their usefulness or their programming beginsto break down, they are murdered. The so called Presidential Modelslike Cathy O’Brien are not allowed to live beyond their 30th year andwhen that came for Cathy in 1987/88, she was told it was her last yearof life. Fortunately, she and the then eight-year-old Kelly would berescued from death by a businessman called Mark Phillips. He had aconsiderable knowledge of advanced mind-control techniques from histime working for the Ampex Corporation and the US Department ofDefense as a civilian subcontractor. This allowed him contact with theleading research scientists in this field and gave him access toknowledge that is denied to the mainstream psychiatric profession.Psychiatrists, like doctors and scientists, are also mind manipulated bythe suppression of information which gives them a distorted picture ofwhat is possible. Mark Phillips was thought to be “safe” because of hisbackground and security clearance, and he was approached by a mancalled Alex Houston for support with a business deal. Houston was nowthe “handler” of Cathy and Kelly and he married Cathy at theinstruction of her controller, Senator Robert C. Byrd.30)Alex Houston, a rapist, paedophile, and drug runner, was an“entertainer”, a ventriloquist and stage hypnotist, who himself had hismind and mouth worked by someone else - the US Government’s mind-control network. It was his job to maintain Cathy and Kelly in theirprogrammed mode by following the instructions he was given, whichincluded food and water deprivation and constant trauma. Houston usedhis travelling to venues as a cover to transport Cathy and Kelly to their“assignments” and this introduced Cathy to the truth about the UnitedStates country music industry, and, indeed, the “entertainment” industryin general. Country music, she discovered, was used by the USGovernment agencies to distribute massive amounts of drugs intoAmerican society and as a cover for its mind-control projects. It wasthese agencies, she says, which paid for the promotion and hype thatturned a singer called Boxcar Willie into a country music “star.” Some30 Trance-Formation Of America, p111."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64of this promotion, Cathy says, took the form of high tech televisioncommercials designed to have a hypnotic affect on the viewer. Hebecame the leader, she writes, of the country music segment of the“Freedom Train” - the internationally recognised code name for theslave operations of Project Monarch. The name “Boxcar Willie” wasnot selected at random. It makes a statement about the man and hisrole. Cathy names Boxcar Willie as a paedophile rapist of mind-controlled women and children, including Kelly whom, she says, heraped regularly in three different mental institutions.31 He is alsoheavily involved in the cocaine operations controlled by thegovernment agencies and he was the man Bill Clinton’s friend, BillHall, began to work with after Clinton persuaded him to becomeinvolved.32 It was Boxcar Willie who inspired the moving of thecountry music “capital” to Branson, Missouri, to be close to the CIA-mind-control and drugs operation based at Lampe, Missouri.33Many people in the entertainment industry are either connected withthe conspiracy or mind-controlled by it. One of the latter was MarilynMonroe, a “lover” of President John F Kennedy. Both were to bemurdered by the same force. Another mind-controlled singer, accordingto Cathy, is Lorretta Lynn, a slave of the CIA. Her mental and emotionalproblems were caused by this. Lorretta’s “road manager”, Ken Riley,is a paedophile and best friend to Cathy’s handler, Alex Houston. Bothwere connected with US Congressman, Gary Ackerman, the“Democrat” from New York, who, Cathy reports, ran an elaborate drugoperation through Long Island Docks.34 Another mind-controlledwoman rescued by Mark Phillips was Seidina “Dma” Reed, thedaughter of actor-singer, Jerry Reed, of the group, Smokey And TheBandits. Seidina had been used many times with Cathy in pornographicfilms under the control of her husband, the sadist, David Rorick (alsoknown as Dave Rowe). Rorick was trained in mind-control by AlexHouston and Seidina’s famous father, Jerry Reed, knew all about it,according to Mark Phillips. Seidina was a favourite sex slave of PrinceBandar Bin Sultan, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the US.35 Thesinger, Kris Kristopherson, a drug-addicted alcoholic born into a CIAfamily, is also involved as a seriously imbalanced controller and mind-31 Trance-Formation Of America, p156.32 Ibid.33 Contact newspaper, March 7th 1995, pp33-34.34 Trance-Formation Of America, p124.35 Ibid p3l."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"65manipulator of slaves, according to Cathy’s book and publicstatements.36 She writes that she was tortured by him and MichaelAquino, using high voltage electric shocks.37 Kristopherson, a Jesuit,is an associate of Senator Robert C.

Cathysays of Kristopherson in her book:“...Kristopherson nearly strangled me to death with his penis, whichhad further sexually excited him, late in the Summer of 1987 duringanother incident related to Byrd.”39Another world famous psychopath and drug runner for thegovernment is the rock and roll “legend”, Jerry Lee Lewis. Cathy saysshe was threatened on many occasions with the words: “we’ll sell youto Jerry Lee”. This was the background to Cathy and Kelly’s lives whenMark Phillips came on the scene. He worked with Alex Houston on abig business deal involving Hong Kong and China, but then he wastold by a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Defence aboutHouston’s background and his involvement with the CIA, drugs, moneylaundering, child prostitution, and... slavery. Phillips’s informant, whoproduced documentary proo{ said Houston was a “very bad man” andthat his crimes were “of the White House”. Mark Phillips writes inTrance-Formation Of America:“My first response to this “officer” was that Houston was too stupidand crooked to be connected with US “intelligence”. This comment wasquickly countered with a gut wrenching photograph of Houston. He wassmiling a demonic grin while apparently having anal sex with a small,very young, frightened black boy. Later he was identfliied to me as beingHaitian.” 40Phillips made contact with an old friend, now dead, who had been anAir Force General in the intelligence division and maintained closeconnections with the upper levels of US and foreign intelligence.

What are you going to do with themif you get them out?’ Before I could answer he interrupted and said:“Look. You’re still the same, but nothing else is with Uncle (the USA).Now most of the CIA, FBI, and the MOB (Mafia) are the same, andthey’re making moves on the military.” 41Phillips was insistent that he wanted to attempt a rescue and his friendgave him the mind-controlling codes (based on Christianity and God)that would activate Cathy to go with him. The full and detailed story istold in their book which I urge you most strongly to read. Phillips tookthem to Alaska while leaving messages for the authorities that he hadno intention of exposing the truth. He said he would ... take them toAlaska and play like a voiceless chameleon”. This, as he hoped,probably spared their lives at this stage. They have also been helpedby many good people in intelligence who want to root out the evil.There is an internal “war” unfolding. In Alaska, Mark Phillips used hisknowledge, with covert support from his contacts, to deprogrammeCathy’s compartmentalised mind. This immense task absorbed almostevery spare waking moment month after month after month. But hewas successful and Cathy’s mind and memory returned. What a storyshe now had to tell as she remembered with crystal clarity all thathappened to her and Kelly. Sadly Kelly’s deprogramming proved evenmore difficult and she suffers from severe asthma caused by theconstant trauma she has suffered. Attempts were made by the CIA mind-controller, Dr Lewis Jolyn West, and his associates to take Kelly fromCathy and Mark and eventually the authorities used the “law” to ensurethe United Fascist States of America had control of her once again. Atthe time of writing Kelly, aged just 16, is a political prisoner under thecustody of the State of Tennessee. The media and public have beenbanned from court cases involving Kelly and she is denied the right toan independent attorney. The court has also banned the words41 Trance-Formation Of America, pp13-14."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"67“President”, “politics”, “New World Order”, “mind-control” and“George Bush”.42 Kelly and Cathy are never allowed to talk alone andtalking in any way about the past is forbidden. Mark Phillips, whosaved Kelly from her torture by the state, is banned from even seeingher. The authorities refuse to de-programme Kelly from her ProjectMonarch-MKUltra mind-control by invoking the National Security Act(amended by Reagan in 1984) which allows them to use the excuse of“national security”. They are terrified of what Kelly would remember.Whenever you see governments using the guise of “national security”to deny justice and information, what they really mean is the securityof their own criminal behaviour.Cathy and Mark have had their lives threatened many times, but theyhave sent their information, with documented and sometimes audio tapesupport, to a stream of US politicians, government agencies, andpressure groups, including Bob Dole. Why no reaction, Mr Dole? Theyhave also produced their astonishing book, Trance-Formation OfAmerica, and spoken extensively at public meetings all over thecountry. This has probably kept them alive because to kill them wouldmerely confirm that what they say is true. And if Cathy’s claims arenot true, where is the legal action against her and the book? Most ofthe names involved are so wealthy that the cost of such an action wouldbe no trouble. Why the silence in the face of allegations as grave andextreme as these? If you wish to support Cathy and Mark in theircampaign for justice you can write to them at P.O Box 158352,Nashville, Tennessee 37215.With her mind cleared of its compartments, Cathy was able toremember all that she had heard about the global conspiracy. Becauseshe was thought to be “safe”, she witnessed many conversations aboutthe New World Order which support the themes that I and scores ofothers have written about, including the plans for a military coup onthe United States.43 As Cathy’s experiences confirm, the attempt tocomplete the takeover of the world is not a theory it is REAL. It’shappening now. She says she heard both Reagan and Bush insist thatthe only way to “world peace” is the “mind control of the masses”. Shewas able to observe the planning of the New World Order project,Education 2000, while under the control of another of her and Kelly’sprogrammers and sexual abusers, Bill Bennett, a Jesuit-trained42 Trance-Formation Of America, p223.43 For more on this see . . and the truth shall set you free and The Robots’ Rebellion."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68mind-controller, who became US Education Secretary under Reagan-Bush.44 An alleged paedophile is named Education Secretary of theUnited States? Give me strength. He was eventually replaced asEducation Secretary by his associate, Lamar Alexander, the formerGovernor of Tennessee, with whom Cathy says she had been forced totake part in a Satanic ritual in an affluent area of Nashville.45 BillBennett’s brother, Bob, who is also alleged to have raped Kelly at theBohemian Grove in 1986, later became “legal counsel” to BillClinton.46 Another of Bill Bennett’s roles was to head a “war of drugs”for George Bush! Well at least Bennett could not be accused of a lackof experience in the subject. Cathy was used to compromise andprovide “favours” for key politicians to ensure support for Education2000. She learned that this project, also known as America 2000 andGlobal 2000, is designed to increase children’s “learning” capacitywhile destroying their ability to critically think for themselves.47 Yes,mothers and fathers, our children are being mind-controlled every dayat school and most of the teachers don’t even know they are doing it! Afriend who works in education research in the United Kingdom has hadaccess to suppressed surveys which show that children are asking fewerand fewer questions about the “facts” they are told at schoolparticularly after they move to the senior schools.Cathy witnessed how the United Nations is just a vehicle for theGlobal Elite of the All Seeing Eye. George Bush referred to the NewWorld Order as his “Neighbourhood” and talked of how he simply toldmany other world “leaders”, like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, what todo and say. No doubt the same applies to Saddam Hussein. The USAmbassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, is knowingly part of theNew World Order conspiracy and George Bush once described her inCathy’s presence as .... . the reverend mother of all sisters (slaves).”48Albright knows about the US Government’s mind-controlled slaves andsupports that policy. Yet there she is in front of the television camerasat the United Nations lecturing other countries on “human rights.” BrianMulroney, the Canadian Prime Minister and child rapist, talked aboutthe plan for the New World Order while with Cathy and Reagan at thesame White House cocktail party at which she met Albright.

This is the signof the New World Order cult known as the Order of the Rose, possiblyinspired by the Elite-controlled secret society called the Rosecrucians,and it is part of the All Seeing Eye Cult. Other people connected to theOrder of the Rose include Clinton, Bush, Byrd, Bennett, and Trudeau.How fascinating, then, that the United Kingdom Labour Party shouldchange it’s party symbol in the 1980s to... the red rose. Isn’t life justfull of amazing coincidences?Another vital area which Cathy O’Brien’s experiences highlight isthat of the “alien” threat. Some of her mind compartments wereprogrammed with “alien” themes and many of her abusers, includingBush, claimed to be “aliens” from “far of{ deep space” who had takenover the planet. Cathy believes that holographic projections were usedto give the appearance to her of people transforming into “lizard-like”aliens. This relates to the theme in some UFO and extraterrestrialresearch of a race known as “Reptilians” operating on the planet. Whatif it was not a hologram that Cathy saw? What if these reptile-likeextraterrestrials can manifest in human form? I know it sounds fantastic,but with each month that passes I am more convinced by the weight ofevidence that this is the case. I will expand on this in my next book.However, I emphasise again that we need to treat claims about thethreat of an “alien” invasion of this planet with enormous care. If youhave “flying saucer” - type technology developed in the secretunderground bases and you have the ability to project highly detailedholographic images, you can easily dupe people who do not know whatis happening into believing they are witnessing such an invasion or a“sign” in the sky from “God”, whichever God you may choose tofollow. That doesn’t mean that what appears to be happening is actuallyhappening. The extraterrestrials known as Reptilians and their offshootsdo not need to invade the planet. They are already here!The events described by Cathy are not limited to the United States.The Cult of the All Seeing Eye is a global operation and so its Satanic,black magic, rituals are going on all over the world.

I will leave her unnamed at this time.The stories she told me about her experiences mirrored so many of thosedescribed by Cathy O’Brien. Soon after she was born in Darlington inthe 1 930s, she was sold by her father to two Satanists. She knew themonly as Thomas and Helena. She was “brought up” in the most horrificcircumstances at a children’s home in Hull, which was run by two otherchild abusers. At night a torch light would be shone into their bedroomsand if it was held on you for a minute for so, you knew it was your turnto go downstairs and be sexually abused.

Please tell me what you know.Ted Gunderson, a man of 28 years experience with the FBI, told amind-control conference in the United States that after long and detailedresearch, he estimates there are 3.75 million practicing Satanists in theUS and between 50 and 60,000 human sacrifices a year. Therapists atthe conference said that their clients had pointed to a mass Satanicgrave site in open land outside Lancaster, California.50 Another exists,apparently, at Matamoros, Mexico.During holidays back in Darlington, from the age of just seven andeight, my English informant met her father, who connected her withthe two Satanists, Thomas and Helena. She would be given drugs viaorange juice and ice cream and taken at night in a van to countrychurches in the Darlington area. The drugs were designed to make hereasier to mind-control and compartmentalise to prevent her fromremembering what she saw. However, as is often the case when peopleenter their 30s and 40s, the compartments gradually break down andtheir minds start to relive flashbacks of their ordeals. They experiencethem again like watching a movie screen. It is for this reason that somany are murdered before they reach that age. Others are subjected tothe “snatchback” when they are abducted to undergo “booster” mindprogramming to keep the compartments in place and the memoriessecret. Increasing numbers of people who survived their horrendousyoung lives are now beginning to remember and they are telling thesame basic tale.

The windows of the church were covered over withblack drapes and the inside was laid out according to Satanic law withdifferent colours used for different ceremonies, depending on the timeof year.

The Satanists, she remembers, weredressed in robes and a number wore masks, including the face of a goat.In the UK, as in America, some of the best known names in the countryare involved. She remembers vividly (God, the thought of it) being laidon her back on the floor of a church as a screaming boy, no more thansix, was being held by the hair above her while a man who would laterbecome a top politician in Northern Ireland had anal sex with him.When it was over, a knife was produced to cut the boy’s throat and theblood poured over her. “I remember this man’s eyes” she told me “Thecoldness of his eyes I will never forget”. He prefers boys to girls, shesaid. Why am I thinking of the Kincora Boys Home in Belfast as I writethis? On more than one occasion, she says, she was brutally raped byanother man who has been a big name in United Kingdom politics fordecades. This man, she says, used to hold her naked body to him byusing hooks inserted into her flesh at the hips. She was just a little girlwhen this was happening. I know this is hard to read and I was numbfor days when I heard all this, but it’s time to be adult and know whatis really going on in the world, because if we don’t this will continue.Within days of speaking to me, the woman was grabbed off the streetand bungled into a van by six Satanists. A syringe was held to her throatas she was warned to stop talking to that “dangerous prat” Icke and tostop naming names. They threatened her life and those of her childrenif she continued. She was also told that if she didn’t keep quiet, thefamily dog would be taken and “posted back to you in pieces”. Nicepeople.

These were the only tell-tale evidences asidefrom the scarring burns left on her skin. Houston forbade me to call adoctor and Kelly forbade me to comfort her pitifully complaining thather head “hurt too bad even to move.” And she did not move for hourson end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain, and her rectumusually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her. My ownmind-control victimisation rendered me unable to help or protect her.Seeing my child in such horrible condition drove my own wedge ofinsanity in deeper perpetuating my total inability to affect her needsuntil our rescue by Mark Phillips in 1988.“Kelly’s bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators ofGeorge Bush’s paedophile perversions. I have overheard him speakblatantly of his sexual abuse of her on many occasions. He used thisand threats to her life to ‘pull my strings’ and control me. Thepsychological ramifications of being raped by a paedophile presidentare mind-shattering enough, but reportedly Bush further reinforced histraumas to Kelly’s mind with sophisticated NASA electronic and drugmind-control devices. Bush also instilled the ‘Who ya gonna call?’ and‘I’ll be watching you’ binds on Kelly, further reinforcing her sense ofhelplessness. The systematic tortures and traumas I endured as a childnow seem trite in comparison to the brutal physical and psychologicaldevastation that George Bush inflicted on my daughter”51While I was reading that and putting together the other informationin this chapter, do you know what was happening in the UnitedKingdom? The collective psyche of England was mesmerised by a soccermatch in the European football championship known as Euro ’96. Thenewspapers, radio, and television, were ablaze with stories about theEngland football team. The tabloid papers, particularly the Daily Mirror,were full of pathetic pictures of English players, including some wearingtin helmets as the Mirror declared “football war” on Germany.41 Trance-Formation Of America, p158."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"74Meanwhile, these “journalists” were allowing all that I have describedand so much more to continue uninvestigated, unexposed. England lostto Germany in that match (good) and it was seen as a time for nationalmourning. Some people cried because eleven Englishmen in grey shirtshad failed to kick a ball into a net more times than eleven Germans inwhite shirts. Still others went on the rampage in towns and cities. OneRussian man was stabbed because he “sounded” like a German. And afew people can’t control the world and keep all this stuff quiet? It’s adoddle. I am not knocking football. Played well it is a beautiful game,but it’s just that - a game. It isn’t important. If it’s not soccer, it’s soapson the television, lotteries, and game shows which focus the collectivepsyche on total crap and therefore divert our minds from what the tinyfew are doing to us and our world. Also at the time I was compilingthis chapter, I was approached in the street by two Mormon“missionaries” seeking to convert me to their “faith”. These two youngclones of the mind manipulators of Salt Lake City had no idea of thehorrors being perpetrated in that place, nor that the true controllers oftheir “church” are the Satanists and child abusers of the United StatesGovernment. The human race has allowed itself to become little morethan a mushroom which is constantly kept in the dark and fed bullshit.Cathy O’Brien and my contact in England both agree that despite allthe horrors and mind-control they suffered, their core spirituality couldnot be broken. That spiritual core is the unbreakable spark of lightwithin us. It is the Source Consciousness. Pure love. That is far morepowerful than any scale of negativity. It is the spark which will lead usout of here if only we will set it free.What are the emotions within you now as you read of those namesand the actions I’ve described? For most, I have no doubt, it will be acombination of hatred, anger and fear. All of them understandable. Butwhat emotions also consume the people who do these things and thosewho control the Cult of the All Seeing Eye? Hatred, anger, and fear.We surely don’t need any more of that. Those who have suffered andcontinue to suffer from these people, or rather the consciousness thatpossesses them, clearly need our love in enormous abundance. But so,too, do those responsible. It is the absence of love in their hearts thatallows them to do it. Of course, what they do must be exposed andthey must take the karmic consequences of their actions. We’re allsubject to that and the time for them to face their actions is here. Butplease, send them love, not hatred. They are possessed people. Forgivethem, they know not what they do."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"75To simply hurl abuse and hatred at those involved would be an easyway to pass our responsibility for all this to someone else, to externalisethat responsibility instead of looking at ourselves. It is no good anyoneabdicating their responsibility for what has happened to Cathy O’Brienand is still happening to her daughter, Kelly, and millions of others allover this planet. People like Bush, Clinton, Reagan, Ford, Trudeau,Mulroney, and Cheney may be among the physical perpetrators of thesehorrors, but they can only go on controlling this world and treating ourfellow men, women, and children, in this astonishing manner becausehumanity has given its mind away and allowed the few to run the show.YOU are responsible, also, and so is everyone, particularly those whohave handed over their own infinite power to such an extent that theyhave become two-legged sheep in the bewildered herd. If humanity willlearn the lessons of all this and take their power back, then the people Iname in my books will, in terms of collective human evolution, havedone everyone a favour by showing so, so clearly, what happens whenyou concede your right to be you.You control your reality; we all do, and collectively we have createdthe global reality exposed here. We can create a new reality. It’s just athought, a choice, a change of attitude away. There is not a moment tolose. The time to make that choice is..

I’m not surprised. I thoughtI’d never be shocked again, but nothing prepares you for the scale ofblackness which currently controls Planet Earth. Such control, however,is only possible because we have conceded our inner power. Indescribableas those events may be, the people involved are telling us something aboutourselves. Nothing happens in isolation. Everything has a consequence.When you give your mind and responsibility away, you allow the few tocontrol the mass. Given the staggering extremes described in the lastchapter, you can appreciate the scale to which the human race has handedits infinite power to this Global Elite. The Elite, in fact, is a mirror of usand our inner state of being. The information presented in the rest of thisbook is fundamental to the dismantling of the global pyramid and theunimaginable suffering it constantly manifests.The definition of the word Mirror: polished surface; reflecting image;that which gives faithful reflection. So says the Oxford ConciseDictionary. Lift your eyes from this page. Look around you. Look atyour life, your family, your job, your friends and surroundings. Youare looking at a mirror. A mirror of you.If you don’t like your life, then change it. You’re in control. You havecreated the life you don’t like, so now create one that you do. Crazy?Too simple? Not at all. You are in control of your destiny and so iseveryone. We have just been conditioned to believe that someone elseis in control, so we create that reality. If we can be duped into believingthat we are powerless to control our lives, we look to others forguidance and answers instead of trusting ourselves. People hand theirpower to priests, gurus, politicians, economists, and scores of others.Tell me what to think, Mr Pope, Mr Rabbi, Mr New Age “teacher”.Hey, YOU are in control of you.

And what are youdoing allowing it to happen? You can take your power back. It isinfinite.Every second of every day in every breath of your life, you arecreating your own reality. Our lives reflect precisely our imaginationof ourselves. If we think we are a “common man and woman” andthat the good things and great achievements happen only to others,that is the way it will be. Our lives will reflect that imagination andperception of ourselves. If we desire to give our power away to others,to hand over our responsibility for the world and our own destiny;then our lives, and the world, will reflect that imagination andperception. Those thoughts will manifest themselves physically as aGlobal Elite running the show. And they have. What we call the worldis a second-by-second physical replica of human thought, the humanimagination, or lack of it. We are what we think and feel. Bill Hicks,the American comedian, was very funny and very perceptive. He wasmaking powerful statements about life and the way we are controlledbefore he died in 1994 at the age of only 33. He described life in thisway:“It’s like a ride in an amusement park and when you choose to go onit you think it’s real because that’s how powerful our minds are. Theride goes up and down, round and round, it has thrills and chills, andit’s very brightly coloured and very loud. And it’s fun for a while. Somehave been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: Is thisreal or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered and theycome back to us and they say: Hey, don’t worry, don’t be afraid, everbecause this is just a ride.“And we kill those people.“Shut him up! We’ve got a lot invested in this ride. Shut him up! Lookat my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family.This has to be real.“It’s just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try to tell usthat. Have you ever noticed that? And we let the demons run amok. Butit doesn’t matter because it’s just a ride. And we can change it anytimewe want. It’s just a choice. No effort, no job’ no savings of money. Achoice right now between fear and love.”"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"78The difference between fear and love is the difference between aprison and a paradise. Both are the physical reflections of thoughts.Our thoughts.The suppression of knowledge over these centuries of psychologicalfascism (also known as religion, education, “science” and the media)has sought to deny us information that would open our eyes and ourminds to who we really are. Knowledge about our own identity hasbeen systematically kept from us. This has been done because withinthis knowledge lies the understanding that would set us free. Religion,and more latterly “science”, have been the major players in thissuppression. For a long time, and still today in many parts of the world,to reject what religions demand we believe has been a death sentence.More widely today, to reject that which society and “science” demandswe believe is to attract ridicule and condemnation. Merely to investigatebeliefs outside the mainstream Hassle-Free Zone is often to be dubbedstrange, mad or dangerous. Yet it is those beliefs that have stood thepassage of time, not those indoctrinated into us these past few thousand,and in the case of “science” the last few hundred, years. As evermounting evidence has forced “science” to open its eyes, oh so slowly,to the desperate limitations of its childlike belief system, so theevidence gathers by the day that the so called “alternative” beliefs haveheld in their core an eternal truth that has survived the dark years ofinquisition and suppression. It is time for that knowledge to step out ofthe shadows and be open for all to see. Through the ages it has beenused secretly by the manipulating few the cult of the All Seeing Eye,to imprison humanity. Now it can be used with love to set us free.The manufactured, manipulated, versions of life called religion and“science”, may seem to be in opposition. But again, on closer reflection,they are oppo-sames. Both survive only by the suppression ofknowledge and both have fostered a fear, even terror, of death. On theone side we are told of some God who will judge us after our one lifeon Earth, a life that will last anything from a few seconds to a hundredyears or more. As a result of this one life in which we are all born intovastly different circumstances, this loving, judging, often merciless andvindictive God, will decide if it is heaven or hell forever and a day.Apparently, unless we believe that His son, Jesus Christ, is our saviour,I’m afraid we are doomed to stoke the fires for you-know-who. Ofcourse we could always make sure of our place upstairs if we allowedthe priests to tell us what to say, think, and do, because as Hisrepresentatives on Earth, they know what He wants.

Andwhat if I make big donations to the church while poverty aboundsaround me or I go off and kill a few thousand people who refuse tobelieve what I am told to believe? Oh my son, the Lord shall look uponyou with gratitude (He says the cheque should be made out to me, bythe way). You see how simple life is when you don’t have to think?This mentality has dominated human evolution into the modern worldand, amazing as it is to me, it still controls the minds of countlessmillions as we enter the 21st century. Because people are not keen onbeing judged by “God” (what if I don’t pass?) they put off that dreadfulday for as long as they can. Thus, anything that might possibly bringthat day forward is immediately avoided and the fear of death becomesa wonderful means of keeping people quiet and under the iron fist.Nothing has been more successful in controlling the human mind thanreligion and that control has depended for its survival on thesuppression of knowledge, not least the knowledge that life is forever,for everyone, and that we are not apart from God, we are God. Oops,I’ve blasphemed. Slap my wrist. Throw us that shovel, this fire needs astoke.The word science comes from a word meaning knowledge which iswhy I always write it as “science”. For mainstream “science” is not thepursuit of knowledge overwhelmingly, it is about defending a rigidbelief system and repelling all information that would demolish thefoundations of those rigid beliefs. In that sense, “science” and religionare at one. This form of “science” is just another religion with thepriests in white coats instead of long gowns. “Scientists” have becomethe new priesthood. “Science” is stuck in the five senses of touch, smell,hearing, taste and sight. If something can’t be measured by one of thoseit cannot possibly exist. Really? What about thought? Thought cannotbe touched, smelled, heard, tasted or seen, except as its physicalexpression. Does that mean thought does not exist? Of course it exists.Or at least I think it does! So what is thought? According to mainstream“science”, thought is a physical brain function. But what about neardeath experiences when the person is physically dead for a short time?Tens of millions have experienced their consciousness leaving theirbody and observing their own physical form from some otherdimension or state of being. Often they describe what the doctors andnurses were doing while they were “dead”. What about those who recallunder deep hypnosis the fine details, checkable and provable, ofprevious lives on the Earth? They were then in a different body with a"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"80different brain, so how can their thoughts and memories be a functionof the brain they have now? Instead of looking at the endless evidenceof people’s experiences and evolving scientific understanding in thelight of that, the mainstream “scientists” seek to discredit and dismissthe experiences of multimillions all over the world to preserve the“scientific” status quo: What people have experienced could not happenunless our view of physics is wrong” comes the “scientific” response“and as our physics cannot possibly be wrong, those people must havebeen mistaken”. Oh, good. Thank you very much, Mr “Expert”, we canall go back to sleep now. And there was me thinking that the “scientists”didn’t know it all.As the foundations of scientific certainties see their credibilitycrumble under the avalanche of information now emerging, theirexplanations of “unexplainable” phenomena become more and moresilly and hysterical. In Britain we have a university lecturer who iswheeled out onto virtually every television and radio programme aboutthese subjects. Her role is to debunk alternative information with oftenridiculous “explanations” and to defend the “scientific” status quo untilher knuckles turn white. I wonder what it is within the psyche of thosein the “scientific” establishment which makes them so desperate topersuade people that only oblivion awaits us at the end of our physicallife. When the brain dies, we cease to exist, they cry. They have everyright to believe that if they wish. The reason I challenge the “science”establishment is not for what they believe, but for the way theyindoctrinate others into believing the same and suppress the alternativeexplanations.The fear of oblivion fostered by “science” is also a big incentive toput off the moment of death as long as possible, so people keep theirheads down and their mouths shut in case they bring forward thatterrible day when the lights go out forever. The cosmic accident-life’s-a-bitch-and-then-oblivion scenario is also a massive blow to human selfworth. What’s the point in life, it’s all so meaningless isn’t it? There isone other vital connection between the views of most religion andmainstream “science”. They both believe our lives and our destiny arein the hands of others. Religion says God is in control of our life andthat He is constantly judging our every thought and action. Mygoodness old God must have a big note book. And all those pens.“Science” says that random accidents are in control of our life and onlythe strongest and fittest survive the journey. I’d better trample oneveryone in my way, then. It’s no good being soft - get out of my way."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"81It’s the law of nature, you know. “Scientists” have proved it. Yes, myfriends, take your pick. Is God in control of your life or a series ofrandom accidents?Neither. YOU are.Persuading us that we are not in control and cannot be in control isthe perfect way to prevent us from taking control - the last thing youwant to happen if your aim is to create a human herd, all desperate forothers to tell them where to go, what to do, and what to think. Whatbetter means can there be to prevent us from expressing our true powerthan to kid us that we have no power to express? Which is why theknowledge I am about to outline is so dangerous to those few whocontrol the world. People celebrating their uniqueness and controllingtheir own lives will bring the Larry Grayson pyramid and its GlobalElite crashing to the ground. Game over.Open-minded real science is now beginning to support the beliefs ofthe ancient cultures and civilisations that have long gone. AncientGreece, Egypt, Sumer, Babylon, Central and South America, Asia,China, and thousands of other cultures across the world were based onthis knowledge. So were, and are, the beliefs of the native peoples likethe Aborigines and the Native Americans. Ironically, Christianity, whichhas so condemned these cultures, was founded on the same knowledgeand its ceremonies derive from the so called “Pagan” ceremonies whichChristians dismiss as “evil”. You’ve got to chueme really. These beliefs,often passed on in legend, myth, and symbolism to avoid the religioushit squads, say that the mind and the body are not the same thing. Thebody is an expression of our consciousness during a physical life andso the body, too, reflects our state of mind. Disharmony in theconsciousness reflects itself as disharmony (dis-ease) in the body. Webecome ill. In the same way we can think ourselves back to health byfinding harmony within our consciousness. But the body is not the“real” self, it is the temporary physical shell for the real self. I call thebody a genetic spacesuit, the physical vehicle through which the eternalpart of us - the soul - can experience this dense physical world. Ourconsciousness is eternal while the body has a finite life and returns tothe soil and the energy pool when we “die”. But we don’t “die”. Ourconsciousness, the thinking, feeling, emotional us, withdraws from thespacesuit and moves on to another world, another time-space reality orfrequency. This is happening during the near-death experience. It’s"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"82interesting that when we talk of God or heaven, most people still lookup to the sky. It is a reflex response to the religious belief that God andheaven are somehow “up there”. If you look at the enormous evidencethat extraterrestrial life has played a major role in human evolution andhow they landed here regularly in ancient times, I believe that we stilllook up for God and heaven because the “gods” of the ancient texts,including the Old Testament, were extraterrestrials in their anti-gravity(flying saucer) craft. The “gods” literally came from the sky. Tbe wordfrom which the biblical “Lord” was translated really means Lords, theplural. It is the same with the biblical “God”. It was translated from aword meaning “gods.” Read the Old Testament and replace every Lordand God with the word extraterrestrials and what appears to be biblicalnonsense starts to make some kind of sense. You will find much moreabout this in ... and the truth shall set you free and The Robots’Rebellion. By the way, those who dismiss the idea of extraterrestriallife might remember that there are estimated to be four billion stars inthis galaxy and four billion galaxies in this universe. And we are alone?Sure we are.This diversion of God being “up there” and somehow physical innature has led to the idea that creation is a spiritual chest of drawers orhigh-rise office block with heaven at the top and hell at the bottom.This has obscured the understanding that heaven, hell and God areeverywhere. Heaven and hell are states of mind which we canexperience anytime. We can have hell on Earth or heaven on Earth. Itis our choice, our state of mind, which decides that. God is literallyeverywhere because “God” is a gigantic energy field/consciousnesswhich is everything. It is your body, your mind, the grass, the trees, thesky, the rain. Everything. If it exists, it is an expression of the sameocean of energy/consciousness that we call God and Creation. Just aswater, clouds, and ice (liquid, gas, solid) are the same substance indifferent states of being, so everything in Creation is the same energy/consciousness in different states of being. We are like droplets ofconsciousness in this ocean of consciousness. We are individual, yes,in that we are the sum total of all our experiences and they will bedifferent from all the other droplets. But together with the energy/consciousness of the animals, insects, trees, flowers, extraterrestrials,everything, we form the ocean called “God”. It is the same principle asindividual droplets of water joining together to form the sea. The wavesthat break on the shores of Australia are part of the same mass of waterwhich crashes against the harbour walls of Ireland or New York. In the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"83same way, the animals are not apart from you. They are you. So are thetrees, the grass, the water. Everything is you and you are everything. Ifyou hurt another expression of God, you are only hurting yourself,another aspect of yourself.Far from being “up there”, the infinite consciousness we call God iseverything and everywhere. It is you and everything around you,including all the other “worlds” that we cannot see. The energy field/consciousness we call God is not a chest of drawers. It consists ofendless time-space realities (worlds) all sharing the same space andinterpenetrating each other. There are different frequencies ordimensions, just as the frequencies of radio and television stations sharethe same space that your body is occupying now. To access one of thosestations, all you do is tune your television or radio to a particularfrequency and bingo there it is. Move the dial and one station“disappears” and you tune to another. When you move the dial from aparticular station, that station doesn’t cease to exist, it goes onbroadcasting, even though you are no longer tuned to it and you arenot aware of what it is transmitting. So it is with the infinite frequenciesof Creation. At this moment, your consciousness is tuned to this“station”, the one we call the dense physical universe. But all the otherfrequencies of Creation continue to exist in the same space we areoccupying, even though we are not aware of them. The physical bodyand brain screen out of our perception far, far more than we actuallyfeel and see. The whole of Creation exists within the same “empty”space that you are occupying now - “The kingdom of heaven is withinyou”. But all except a fraction of that infinity operates outside of thefrequency range of our physical senses. Therefore we don’t see it orhear it, although you can tune to some of these “hidden” levels by usingyour psychic senses which operate on a much higher frequency rangethan the physical body. The space around and within you now, whichappears to be “empty” to your physical senses, is in fact ablaze withelectrical and magnetic energy operating on an infinite number ofwavelengths and states of being. When we “die”, our consciousnessleaves the physical body and this dense physical wavelength, and tunesto another “station” to continue our eternal evolution elsewhere. Duringsleep our consciousness journeys through some of these otherwavelengths, hence we have “strange” dreams. It is so simple.Energy and consciousness are the same, which is why all things arealive and have an awareness, the ability to hold information. Everythinghas its own personal vibratory “fingerprint”. When a psychic holds a"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84stone or an old ring or object, they can tune their consciousness to itsenergy field and “read” the information it has absorbed. This couldrelate to the person who once owned the object or an event thathappened near the object. Whatever the case, it will retain thatknowledge within a magnetic field, just like a magnetic computer disk.Rocks and stones hold information within their magnetic fields whichgoes back millions of years and changes now unfolding in the Earth’senergy fields will release this information into the minds of those whoare open to it. An aspect of this re-emerging knowledge will be amazingdiscoveries that demolish the official version of history and confirm,for example, the existence of ancient civilisations like Atlantis.Obviously, some expressions of the God consciousness/energy haveevolved to a point where their awareness and ability to retain andprocess information is much further along the road than others. But theprinciple is the same for all that exists. Magnetic energy absorbsinformation and everything is magnetic-electrical energy, albeit oftenforms of magnetism not yet understood on this planet. One physicalworld expression of this energy is what we call electromagnetism. Sometrue scientists have suggested that water has a memory and they haveperformed experiments to prove it. There is no mystery in this at all,much as mairistream science is aghast at the suggestion. Water exists,it is magnetic energy/consciousness, therefore it has a memory.Everything does. It is this magnetism, a vibratory resonance andattraction, that allows us to create our own reality in every moment ofour lives. Like vibrations attract like vibrations and like energy fieldsattract like energy fields. What we think of ourselves is reflected in theexperiences we attract. I’ll explain what I mean.When our eternal consciousness incarnates into a dense physicalbody, the consciousness reflects the sum total of our experience goingback to infinity. From the moment of birth we see the world differentlyto each other because our eternal journey has been different, althoughit may take two or three years for this to become observable. Even froman early age, however, children manifest these differences ofperception. They become frightened by different things, even withoutdirect experience of them in this life. They reveal different personalities,likes and dislikes, and abilities. Some people say these traits are createdfrom the genes of their parents a view which reveals a desperation tosee everything as physical. But take my experience as just one example.I could not be more different from the rest of my family. For as long asI can remember I felt those differences. I was soon interested in sport"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"85and became a professional soccer player. No-one in my family for asfar back as anyone can trace has ever been interested in playingprofessional sport, nor even, most of them, playing or watching sportat all. My fascination with nature and the protection of the planet isnot shared by anyone in my family. My interest in the spiritual and theresearch into who controls the world is unique to me in my family. Thedifferences in attitude, belief, and view between my parents, brothers,and myself are vast and endless. I am me and they are them becausewe are the sum total of our eternal experiences, not because of somegenetic accident. I am not saying that genetic inheritance does not affectus, but it certainly does not determine our personalities and abilities.Contained within our subconscious self from the moment of birth areall the memories, knowledge, and experiences, that we have absorbedon our eternal journey. The subconscious is also constantly adding toits memory bank with each new event we experience. The observationsthat result from experience pass through the eyes, ears, and brain, andare added to the spiritual library of knowledge and understanding thatwe call our evolution. It also adds to the evolution of creation as awhole. No experience is ever wasted. Also in the subconscious librarywill be astrological influences that are unique to us. There is a greatdeal of nonsense talked about astrology, I feel, both by those whodismiss it as mumbojumbo and those who treat it like a crutch whichguides their every decision. Astrological influences are an importantcontribution to our sense of self, but they are still only part of thepicture, not the entire canvas. Our consciousness is a series of vibratingenergy fields operating in a sea of electromagnetic energy. Othervibrations, like those broadcast by the planets, affect these energy fieldswe call consciousness and can enhance or imbalance them. Here youhave the answer to the “mystery” of why so many people living closeto electrical power lines suffer from rare illnesses. “Science” says thereis no connection between power lines and illness because “science”has such an incredibly blinkered view of life and, no doubt, because toidentify a link would prove very costly to the power companies. Suchunusual illness is caused by the electromagnetic fields projected fromthe power lines. This electromagnetism destabilises the magnetic fieldsof the human body and the consciousness. In turn, this vibrationaldisharmony is reflected as physical disharmony disease. I amconvinced that the rise in cancer and the corresponding rise inelectromagnetic technology in our homes, work places, and cities, arefundamentally connected."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"86This basic process of vibrational interaction between electromagneticenergy fields is similar in astrology. When we are born, we absorb aunique energy pattern for that particular physical life. The nature of thisenergy pattern is decided by when and where we are born1 - theinformation an astrologer always wants to know before a reading.Planets, as with everything that exists, are vibrating magnetic energyfields. Extremely powerful ones, too, of course. As they orbit the Sun,their relationship to the Earth and the power of their energy fields toeffect the Earth, constantly changes. Sometimes the electromagneticvibrations of one planet, or combination of planets, will be mostpowerfully affecting the Earth, while on other occasions it will be otherplanets or combinations of them. So someone born in Leicester, England,at 6.15 pm on April 29th 1952 will absorb a different electromagneticenergy field from a person born in Los Angeles, California, at 10.15 amon October 9th 1985. Because of this, the way people react to thevibrations of the planets as they move through the “heavens” will differbecause our vibratory energy fields are different. One person might belifted by a particular astrological movement while another may feeldepressed. These planetary energies also contain knowledge andinspirations, and our consciousness aims to be born in a place and at atime when we will absorb the planetary energy combination that willhelp us most effectively to complete our plan of experience in thisphysical life. Research has shown how often people in particular jobs orwith particular abilities are born at the same time of year.So within our subconscious self is a cocktail of thought andperception that includes the knowledge and emotional debris of oureternal experiences or “past lives”, the astrological pattern that weabsorb at birth, and the experiences of this life. Together they produceour state of being, our sense of self, our imagination of ourselves. It isour imagination of ourselves that creates our physical reality.Everything is an electromagnetic, vibrating, unique, energy field andall the time we are broadcasting our own unique magnetic energypattern. These are the “vibes” people speak of when they say thatsomeone has good or bad “vibes”. The vibes we broadcast affect theenergy field around us. When we talk of “atmosphere”, we aredescribing the energy field at a certain location, an energy field createdby the thoughts, the vibes, of people. Battlefields can still remain1 Some researchers believe that the moment of conception decides the nature of the energyfield, not birth."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"87“eerie” hundreds of years after the event because the vibrations createdby the pain, aggression, and suffering of battle are still there until otherthought patterns replace them. We walk into a room where there hasbeen a major argument and we say “You can cut the atmosphere with aknife in there”. We go into another house where very positive eventshave happened and we talk of the “lovely atmosphere” or a “happyhouse”. Such examples are all the result of the vibrations, the thoughts,broadcast by people affecting the magnetic energy field. Thesevibrations mirror exactly the person’s state of being at a particularmoment and, it is most important to remember, what we give out iswhat we get back. What we broadcast as a magnetic pattern returns tous as a physical reality. As Bill Hicks said: “All matter is merely energycondensed to a slow vibration; we’re all one consciousnessexperiencing itself subjectively; there’s no such thing as death; life isjust a dream; and we are the imagination of ourselves.” That’s the vitalpoint: we are the imagination of ourselves.Our magnetic pattern reflects our inner sense of self. Our inner realitythen becomes our physical reality because our magnetic pattern attractstowards us other magnetic thought fields - people, places, ways of life,experiences, which mirror precisely the pattern we are broadcasting.This is why, for example, people are attracted to certain locations tomake a home or have a holiday. The attraction is not only visual, butvibrational. Magnetic. We feel drawn or “pulled” there. This is alsohow we set up our “coincidences” - the “fancy seeing you here”situations. These are not random accidents, but magnetic energy fieldsbeing drawn subconsciously together. It is not a “small world”, but theinteraction of magnetic fields can make it appear so! By this process ofvibrational magnetism, our subconscious mind creates an exact physicalreplica of itself before our eyes in the people, places, ways of life, andexperiences, that come our way. As I said at the start of this chapter,when you look through your eyes you are looking at a mirror of yourinner self. Everything will be reflecting part of you, or your need tolearn or experience something. Change your inner self and you changeits physical replica - your life. The reality you now experience is theresult of what you think of you. It is the imagination you have ofyourself within your conscious and subconscious mind. We create withour thoughts and experience those creations through our emotions andfeelings. Whatever you experience it is the result of what you arebroadcasting because of (a) the thoughts and actions from the past orpresent which you need to face for your evolution or (b) your"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88astrological pattern (chosen by you before birth) which is attracting toyou experiences that are part of your life plan this time or (c) theexperiences you need to face to help you achieve what you have cometo do in this lifetime on Earth.One extreme example of the latter, I believe, is Cathy O’Brien who,as a result of suffering those appalling experiences as a mind-controlledslave, is now able to expose what is happening. Without thoseexperiences she could not have done that. She is a magnificent servantto humanity. It’s important to appreciate that our perception of life whileoutside the physical body is so different to the perception we have whileencased in this dense physical space suit. Therefore the decisions wemake and the lives we choose before incarnation, often seem ridiculousto us when we are experiencing the physical consequences of thosedecisions. This certainly applies to the parents we choose. There is no-one on another level forcing us to incarnate into those situations, soinstead of hurling the blame for an unpleasant childhood onto theparents, we might more positively ask why we chose to experience thatsituation and what we were hoping to learn and achieve by it. Thisallows the destructive resentment to disperse and the constructivelearning to emerge. That includes the children who suffer so dreadfullyfrom the events in chapter four.Like I say, our perceptions when we choose a life are very differentfrom those we have when we are actually experiencing it. It is easy toobserve people creating their own reality. I knew a woman who had noself worth at all. “I’m useless” she would say “I am a useless mother, auseless wife, and I have nothing to contribute”. In the same breath shewould complain that everyone was putting her down! “My husband putsme down, my children put me down, my husband’s parents put medown” she would say. In fact, the reason for that experience was thatshe was putting herself down. That sense of her own self was beingtransmitted as a magnetic vibratory pattern and it was attracting otherpatterns - the people in that woman’s life who were mirroring back herown sense of reality, her own imagination of herself.We are doing this in every moment of every day. When I was atelevision reporter I visited a hostel for physically abused women and Iwas amazed to find that most had been with at least two violent partnersand some had been through three or four. Why did they keep goingaround with such characters?, I thought. It made no sense. But now itdoes. The common theme of those women was their lack of self worth,self love, and self respect, and that had clearly been their reality well"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"89before they began to attract violent partners. At some deep level theyfeel themselves to be so useless and inadequate that they deserve to bepunished. When that vibe is broadcast it will attract that sense of realityin the form of an energy field (man) who desires to punish another.The sense of reality is therefore physically fulfilled and until thewoman’s sense of self changes she will go on attracting partner afterpartner who will treat her in the way that will create the reality, theimagination, she has of herself. The violent man is another expressionof the lack of self worth and self love that has bred like a cancer in thecollective human mind. Violent people are those who hate themselvesand instead of looking inside to find the cause of that self dislike, theythrash out at someone else. Their victim is a convenient mirror. In fact,if we all had big mirrors around our necks the world would change inan hour because we would all see ourselves as other people see us. It isfascinating to see how the way we react to others is merely anexpression of what we think of ourselves and violent people are aperfect example of this. As I look back on my own life I see how mysense of self at certain times attracted an exact physical replica. As achild I was terrified of dogs and wherever I went I was pursued andchased by them. This never happened to my friends who were notafraid. I thought I was just unlucky. I wasn’t. I was creating it byattracting to me what I feared. We need to do this to overcome ourfears, otherwise our potential is severely limited and, in the area relatedto the fear, our evolution comes to a halt. I remember too, that when Ibegan to love and respect myself for what I am, I began to attractaround me more and more people who love and respect me for what Iam and not for what they would like me to be. You don’t like yourfriends? Change yourself and your friends will either change in theirattitude towards you or they will move out of your life and others willemerge to reflect your new sense of you. Everything that happens inyour life you are creating. So many people have told me stories of howthey have walked into a book shop and a book has “miraculously”fallen from the self at their feet. It is not a miracle. They have done itthemselves. Their subconscious has connected magnetically with themagnetic energy field of the book and pulled it off the shelf. Thesubconscious considers the book helpful to the reawakening of itsconscious level and so it drops the hint in a physical way. Whateverwe need, we draw to us.We also create the reality we call illness. Every ailment, whetherminor or life-threatening, we trigger ourselves. We either choose before"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"90incarnation to experience it on the journey to greater understanding orour subconscious sewer of past life and present life emotional garbagemanifests itself physically as a dis-ease. The nature of the physicalillness is related to the mental and emotional state which is creatingthe illness. The body is a constant barometer of our emotions. I canrecommend an excellent book on this subject called You Can Heal YourLife by Louise Hay (Hay House Inc, USA, and Eden GrovePublications, London). We store emotions we don’t want to deal within our bodies. I remember in the 1970s and 80s whenever I was woundup (most of the time) I would feel a pain in my back about half waydown my left lung. In 1995 when I was going through an emotionaltrough I was having an aromatherapy massage by a close friend ofmine. When she ran her hands over that spot, I felt the pain again. Shesaid she would symbolically push that emotion out of the body and Icould deal with it. As she did so, very painfully, I started to cry. I hadno idea why I was crying and I still don’t. But afterwards I felt twostones lighter emotionally. Something, whatever it was, had been letgo. Crying is actually good for us, it releases pent up, suppressed,emotions. I have cried more in the last year than I have in the previous35! But we are told that “big boys don’t cry” and so the big boys die ofheart attacks which result from the stress of unreleased energies withinthem. No-one has an unlucky illness and that includes me with myarthritis from an early age. We create it and so we can uncreate it. Ourbodies are an expression of our minds, emotions, and spirit. You cansee this clearly when you observe people who, sometimes with verylittle preparation, walk barefoot across hot coals without pain or evendiscomfort. Their minds have told their bodies that they won’t burn orfeel pain and their bodies do as they are told. The same principle isalso apparent when a child falls over, but recovers miraculously whenmum or dad has “kissed it better”. The child thinks it is possible to kissit better and so the pain goes. Your mind is in control of your body atall times.It is important, however, to appreciate that we all create our ownreality. I have observed people who accept the principle, but then seekto deny it when something they don’t like happens to them. Instead oflooking positively at what they are meant to learn from that situation,they look for someone to blame. It is the same when people followtheir intuition and “go with the flow”, but then condemn others forfollowing theirs. You can’t have it both ways here. There is not onelaw for one and another for the rest of humanity. There is one law for"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"91all of us: we create our own reality and our physical experience. Lookat all the events in your life, those you like and those you don’t, andyou will see if you are honest with yourself that you have created themby what you think of you. There’s no-one to blame or to handresponsibility over to for what happens in your life. You are responsible.You are in control and you can change whatever you wish by changingyour imagination of yourself. I came across a phrase which capturesthis concept brilliantly:If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get whatyou ‘ve always got.The word “karma” is for me, another way of saying we create ourown reality. Karma is interpreted by many to mean that what we do toothers will be done to us. I feel there’s more to it than that. If we actnegatively towards someone, that action reflects our state of being atthat moment and this will be broadcast as a vibratory pattern. Shouldwe not learn from seeing the effects of our action, we will go ontransmitting that same state of being. This will attract to us a likevibration, someone who will do to us what we have done to another: amirror of our own sense of self which can also be described as ourkarma. If, however, we learn from seeing the effects of our actions, oursense of self changes and so does our pattern. We have learned fromthe experience (the reason for “karma”) and there is no need for us toattract some gratuitous punishment when the learning has already beenachieved. As our pattern has been changed by the experience we willnot attract to us the karma, someone who will do to us what we havedone to another. When our sense of self changes, so does our pattern,and so does the physical experience it attracts. The way the Hindureligion has used the idea of karma to justify a rigid hierarchy or castesystem, is an abuse of the word spiritual. You name it and someonesomewhere will try to use it as a means of control. Karma is no differentin that.Everything, but everything, in our lives comes back to the same point.Our lives are the imagination of ourselves. This applies even tochildren. We see children as physical bodies and that, understandably,affects the way we perceive them. In fact, a child is a multidimensional,eternal consciousness that could quite easily be further along the roadof evolution than his or her parents. The sum total of the experiencesand astrological influences within that child’s consciousness will also"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"92be creating his or her physical reality from the moment of birth. Thedifference, I feel, is that a child is operating on a more limited level ofconsciousness until the body has grown to match the potential of themind. Imagine having access to the full range of your consciousnessand knowledge while trapped in a child’s body. The frustration wouldbe fantastic. But the same principles that apply to adults also apply tochildren and all other expressions of God throughout creation. Wechoose when, where and with whom we incarnate, and we create ourown reality. The loss and suppression of this understanding is the veryfoundation of the ills that have been visited on the Earth for so long.This knowledge reveals that we are in control of our own destiny whilethe versions of “life” that are indoctrinated into us by religion andscience” insist that another force is in control, either a judgmental Godor random accident. You can see why this suppressed knowledge isconsidered so dangerous by those who wish to control us and why ithas been ridiculed or condemned throughout known “history” as either“mad” or the work of the “Devil”. It is the knowledge that will set usfree from the prisons of our own making.I saw a badge made in America which said: “The Truth will set youfree.. .but first it will piss you off”. Very true. When you first realisehow the human race has been so massively duped, it is not nice to hear.Nor, for many, is it a welcome thought that everything that happens inour lives is down to ourselves. What? I can’t blame anyone else? Eeeek!But I’m a victim of circumstance... I’m unlucky.. .1 had a badchildhood... I’m always ill... I was deprived... abused... misled...Er, sorry. There’s no escape. Stop pointing the finger and get this:Your life, all of it, has been down to.. YOU.Why do some people think that news is so terrible? I’m ecstatic. Ifmy life so far has been all down to me, the rest of my eternal existencewill be in my own control, also. Yippeeeeeeee! No-one controls me.I’m not a victim, I’m me. I’m me in control of me. Zipper-dee-do-dah-zipper-dee-ay! Mine’s a double, easy on the ice. The trick is to seizethat control and live it instead of looking for countless ways to denyour own responsibility. To do that we need to detoxify ourselves fromour emotional addictions. Emotions like fear, guilt, resentment, anger,worry, depression and so on, are every bit as addictive as drugs andbooze. People who are addicted to worry, for instance, are alwayssearching for something to worry about because their system has"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"93become so dependent on feeling that energy that it needs its constant“fix”. My mother used to say about some people: “It’s being somiserable that keeps them going”. In a way that is true. Being miserableand depressed is another emotional addiction that people find so hardto break. It becomes their vibrational state.Poor MeThe “poor me” mentality is the most destructive state of mind it ispossible to experience. It is the means through which we createunhappy, unfulfilled lives, and the state of mind that allows a tiny fewto control the direction of the world. Poor Me The Victim. And thevictim mentality creates the victim reality. The spiral of despair. ThePoor Me mentality is always searching for excuses for its suffering,failure, and lack of action to change its circumstances. The Poor Meprison is the most tightly guarded, has the biggest walls, and theprisoners show the greatest reluctance to escape. At times in our liveswhen we are faced with challenging circumstances, we all experiencethe Poor Me mentality. For many, however, it becomes their home, theirpermanent mental and emotional residence. This world is awash withvictims because the world is awash with people conditioned to seethemselves as victims. Poor home, no money, bad luck, bad parents,prejudice. The Poor Me, victim mentality has no shortage of excusesfor its situation, nor people to blame for its plight. The worst thing wecan do in these circumstances is to feed the Poor Me by sympathisingwith their “misfortune” and “bad luck”. We can have empathy with theirpain, but the last thing they need is someone confirming their Poor Mesense of self. Love takes many forms and telling people what will createfurther “misfortune” and pain is certainly not one of them. There areno victims. We just think we are and so we create that physical reality.We are persuaded that life is not for living, it is for surviving. We areso indoctrinated by this that any new vision in which people are happy,prosperous and fulfilled, is dismissed as “idealistic” and not living inthe “real world”. In the “real world”, you see, people have to sufferand battle for survival. Anything else is “idealistic”. The survivalmentality abounds on planet Earth.“How are you today?”“Oh, you know, surviving, but there’s a lot worse off than me, Iguess."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94We are not here to simply survive or exist, nor to judge our own liveson the basis that others suffer more and so we must be grateful for ourlot. But if we think we are - and so many do - that will be the nature ofour life. Throughout history we have been sold the idea that you haveto suffer and sacrifice now to create the good things we desire in the“future”. What we really want to have in our lives are always in thefuture, never the now. Religions have told us we need to suffer andsacrifice in this life to qualify for paradise... tomorrow. Politicians andeconomists tell us we need to make sacrifices now to create economicprosperity... tomorrow. The jam is always tomorrow It is what I call the“one day” syndrome. One day I’ll have what I want, but not now. Ifthat is our reality, our imagination of self, we will never have what wedesire because that energy is always projected into the future and notinto the now. Hope is another example of living in the future. Hope isa future experience, not a now experience. As the Cretan writer, NikosKazantzakhs once wrote: “I am without hope. I am without fear. I amfree.”No-one feeds the victim mentality more than people on the “left” ofpolitics, the Robot Radical mentality as I call it. This state of mindoccupies a mental world of “us and them”, of victimiser and victim.The masses are victims because of the victimising few, this mentalitybelieves. They see life in terms of the bosses and the bossed, the leadersand the led. The Robot Radicals’ sense of reality, their imagination ofthemselves, is the fighter for freedom and justice for the victims. Theway to do this, they believe, is to constantly tell people they are victimsof circumstance, victims of someone else, and that only when thatsomeone else is changed or removed will they cease to be victims ofcircumstance. The Robot Radical state of being actually needs victimsto feed its sense of self. Without perceived victims, it would lose itssense of identity. If victims did not exist, this mentality would have toinvent them. They also have so much anger within themselves that theyare constantly searching for people and circumstances to get angryabout. This is why you often see the same faces at every protest marchand also why those of the Robot Radical mentality have protestedagainst me without reading my books or hearing me speak. They wantto believe that what is said about me is true. It allows them to get angrywith someone to avoid looking at the source of that anger - themselves.It is appropriate that the Robot Radical organisations often have“anti” in their names like the Anti-Nazi League, Green Anti-Fascists,etc. They are stuck in the negative and their view of life would change"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"95dramatically if they started to be “for” things. Most of the RobotRadicals do what they do out of the best of intention. I was on thefringes of that mentality at one time. I saw myself in the British GreenParty as a “fighter” for justice for those less “privileged”. But you don’t“fight” for freedom, you “peace” for freedom. I am not challenging theRobot Radical mentality from a holier than thou position. RobotRadicals are not “bad” people and that includes those who have soughtto give me a hard time personally. But, I would suggest, they areactually defeating their objective because they are feeding and fuellingthe very mentality which is creating the ills they say they want toeliminate. Robot Radicals won’t like what I am about to say, but I wantto see people take back their own power. That’s my motivation for whatI do. I am not trying to win a popularity contest. Robot Radicals hadbetter sit down, have a stiff drink, and, ideally, a whiff of oxygen...Single parent families, those in poor housing and no housing, andthe endless stream of other “victims” trotted out by the Robot Radicalsare not the result of bad luck or misfortune. They are the creation oftheir own thoughts, their own imagination of themselves, or their ownchoices made before incarnation. They don’t need people telling themhow unlucky and victimised they are. They’re already convinced ofthat. They need a new vision of themselves which will create a newand positive physical reality. They have thought their circumstancesinto existence and they can just as easily think them out again. “Getoff your ass and stop feeling sorry for yourself” is often the most lovingadvice you can give to someone. They won’t thank you for it at firstand they might even become abusive. But true love is to say whatpeople need to hear, not necessarily what they want to hear to confirmtheir sense of Poor Me. Whatever circumstances we are born into, wechoose them before birth. The alternatives to this are that life is arandom accident or that the consciousness is created with the body,neither of which stand up to serious discussion. That leaves an eternalconsciousness deciding its own experience by choosing when, where,and with whom to incarnate. You didn’t like your childhood? Then whydid you choose it? What were you hoping to learn from thosecircumstances? Fine, so learn and move on. Look at things in thatpositive way and you can let go of the guilt and resentment from thepast that does so much to destroy our present. You don’t like your lifenow? Ok, what is it about your sense of self, your imagination ofyourself, that is creating it? You don’t deserve to live in poverty or pain.No-one does. We are all of equal worth, value, and potential. So why"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"96are you creating poverty and pain? I don’t care who you are, you arean incredible, astonishing, aspect of God. Express that infinity and yourlife will reflect that. See yourself as small, insignificant, an “ordinary”man and woman in the street, and you will be. You can see life as aseries of problems or a series of solutions. It’s a choice and the livesthose states of mind create will be very different.Ironically, few states of mind need to understand this more than theRobot Radicals who set themselves up as freedom fighters for victims.In truth, they often create victims instead of freeing them. We can onlyfree ourselves. No-one can do it for us. Robot Radicals see themselvesas victims and they feed the victim mentality with almost every wordand pronouncement. “You were born on a council estate in bad housingor in poverty in a New York slum? You are a victim. It’s the bosses,you know. They’re to blame for your situation. We victims must standtogether in victimised solidarity. Raise the victims’ flag brothers andsisters.” I was brought up on a vast council housing estate in Leicesterin a poor family and I remember the “us and them” indoctrination thatwent on. All it did was condition me to see myself as a victim ofcircumstance and someone who would always struggle financiallybecause I was an “us” and not a “them”. That is exactly what happenedto me until I realised what a load of old tosh that is and I began tocreate another reality. How often have I heard this: “I was born workingclass and I’ll always be working class.”? Oh really? Not planning toevolve then? It’s got so silly that where you stand in the Robot Radicalleague table of political purity depends on how badly off you are. It isthe Robot Radical version of suffer little children to come unto me.Pain, which should only be a warning signal that something is out ofbalance, has been integrated into our minute by minute existence.Feeling pain is now “normal” in this crazy world our minds havecreated and to a Robot Radical, and many in the New Age too, painhas taken on the role of a medal, a symbol of your credibility as a fullyfledged, official, mentioned-in-dispatches, victim. Ahh, poor soul. Towin the championship in the Robot Radical league table you have tosuffer more than anyone else! If you are a black, lesbian, single-parent,on social security, squatting in a derelict house, you go straight to thetop of the Robot Radical league table of human victims. “It’s not fair.That woman is so unlucky. She’s just a victim of her own bad luck,poverty, colour, and sexuality.”No she’s not. She is an incredible, amazing, aspect of all that existsand she can be whatever she wants to be. She chose to be black, just as"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"97people choose to be white, Arabs, Jews, and so on. She is not a victim.She has only been persuaded that she is a victim and so her life reflectsthat sense of reality. She needs a new vision of herself, not crocodiletears. Victims don’t do anything about their circumstances because theybelieve they are powerless to do anything and so nothing gets done.It’s someone else’s fault so someone else will have to get me out ofthis mess. What are they going to do about it?, comes the victims’ cry.Don’t get me wrong here. I am not saying that we should ignore thecircumstances of others, nor am I belittling the plight of some blackpeople, lesbians, single-parent families, and the homeless. Quite theopposite. But I want to get to the real solution to the circumstancesthey are facing and that means wading waist high through generationsof bullshit from self-styled “radicals” who have massaged their ownsense of purity while avoiding the whole point: if we want our lives tochange, we have to change them.When people change their sense of self, when they stop seeingthemselves as a victim, their energy pattern changes. It begins tomagnetically attract to them the people, places, experiences,“coincidences” and “luck” which change their circumstances from thenegative (a reflection of the old self) to positive (the new self). It isthen, and only then, that people in trouble can be helped. While theyretain the Poor Me mentality there is nothing anyone can do. Nothingwill work no matter how hard you try, because their magneticconsciousness will continue to create the physical life that befits avictim. Throughout this century and before, we have seen a stream ofpeople and politicians all over the world offering their physicalsolutions to what are, in truth, mental and emotional problems. This iswhy these “solutions” never work. All they do is create structures ofdependency (control) and dependency diminishes our self worth, ourimagination of ourselves, so creating the very circumstances thestructures are supposed to be alleviating. The structure itself becomesa vehicle of control, not freedom.You can’t change a mental state witha penny off income tax or another pound on social security.Throughout this same period the number of “victims” world-wide hasgrown because those who say they wish to remove the problem go onfeeding it. If you are born black or Jewish, for example, you are likelyto be conditioned to expect prejudice. So that is what you get. If youare walking down the street, you will magnetically attract the racistmentality because you will be fulfilling your own sense of reality. Thesame with a homosexual. If you expect prejudice, if it is part of your"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98imagination of yourself, you will not be disappointed. The mentalitythat imagines itself as a victim of prejudice helps to create prejudicebecause without it that sense of self, that imagination of self, could notbe fulfilled. Attracting prejudice is no different to me attracting barking,aggressive dogs as a child while my friends had no such problems. Yetwhat do we see? “Community leaders” representing groups ofcollective “victims” like blacks, Jews and homosexuals, who tell theirversion of “the masses” that they are victims of circumstances createdby others. Yeah, just what they need, that is, eh? It is all so selfperpetuating and avoids the only solution changing our sense of self.If we love and respect ourselves and stop seeing ourselves as victims,that sense of self is broadcast in our magnetic vibration. That will attractto us people and circumstances that mirror back that love and respect.When those blacks, Jews and homosexuals, stop seeing themselves asvictims of prejudice and let go of any prejudices they may have againstother groups, the prejudice and victimisation against them will end. Butnot until.Let us look at this from the global perspective. The sum total ofindividual human reality becomes the collective reality - the world. Youcan see that as human consciousness has become more globallyuniform, this has been reflected physically in the way cities all overthe planet, which once expressed their unique culture, are increasinglylooking the same. As consciousness becomes more uniform, so doesthe physical environment it creates. Politics is another example of thisprinciple. People condemn politicians for thinking only in terms of selfinterest and what’s in it for me. But what is in the hearts and minds ofmost voters when they are deciding which party to support? Yes,precisely: self interest and what’s in it for me. If that is our motivationwhen we vote, we will, and do, create that reality by electing politicianswho reflect in their actions the very state of mind that we used to givethem their power. If you want to change the kind of politicians thatrepresent us, change yourself. If people still think it is worth voting intoday’s rigged system (I don’t), then let us vote for what we believe isright and not only for what we believe is right for us, materially, in theshort term. Then, if this is done by enough people, we will havepoliticians that manifest that state of mind.The same principle applies to the pyramid of global control Idescribed earlier. We created that too, without realising it. If we giveour minds away and stop thinking for ourselves, we are allowing others,governments, Elite families, community leaders, priests, teachers, the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"99media, and pseudo-gurus of all shades, to tell us what we are and howwe should see ourselves. They are programmed to programme the restof us. We are allowing them to condition our imagination of ourselvesand the world and so allowing them to create our physical reality. Whenwe concede our right to be unique and we accept another’s version ofwhat we should be, we allow others to control our physical experience.That is precisely what the human race as a whole has done andcontinues to do. The Hassle-Free Zone is populated by those who areprojecting a programmed sense of self as a physical reality which wecollectively call the “world” or “society”. There are so few realdifferences in the basic mentality within the Hassle-Free Zone becausepeople are getting their programmed sense of self from the same basicsource, the pyramid of conformity, the Global Elite which controls thesources of “information” and indoctrination that hypnotise ourconsciousness. Today even more subtle forms of reality programminggo on thanks to subliminal messages, often via the television, whichspeak directly to the subconscious in ways the conscious mind cannotsee or hear. Make no mistake, those who work to programme humanreality know exactly how to do it, because they are working withknowledge passed on secretly over thousands of years via the upperlevels of the global secret society network, the origins of which go backto Atlantis and beyond. This is the same knowledge that has been keptout of the public arena by the twin responses of “mad” and “bad”.We can remove the means of this control by ceasing to conform andby using our own immense power to effect positive change. This canbe done in very simple ways. You can sit quietly and visualise whateveryou want to create for yourself. See it happening to you now in thatmoment. Thought creates exactly what you think, so if you visualisesomething happening in the future it will always be happening in thefuture and never in the now. You can use this same technique, perhapswith a group, to visualise and project the thought form of peace, love,harmony and the end of conflict. These visualisations do work becausethev are concentrated thought and thought creates everything. Only ifwhat you desire is not appropriate to your life experience will a higherlevel of yourself block it. Also, it is important to remember the chainreaction of words and behaviour. What we say and do is like throwinga pebble into a pond. The waves continue to affect the water long afterthe pebble has gone. If you walk into a shop and you are nasty andunpleasant to the shop keeper, it will make him angry and wound up.After you leave he will be less than pleasant to his next customer or"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"100his wife and family. This will upset them and so it goes on. But thischain reaction can be used positively. If we knock on the door of theboss no-one likes and say we think he is doing a great job and what apleasure it is to work with him, it is likely to make his day. Nobodywill have said that to him before. He will be lifted by the complimentand this is likely to be reflected in the way he treats his staff. In turn,they will feel happier and enjoy their work, thus they are more likelyto be pleasant to their families when they go home. It’s only a choiceand we constantly underestimate the effect on the world of the so called“little” things that we say and do. Every time we think or feel we affectthe sea of electromagnetic energy and affect everything that exists. And,of course, if we are loving and pleasant to others because we feel happyand loving inside, that state of being will attract the same reaction tous. How we treat each other in the supermarket or the office may notappear to be revolutionary, but it is. If we are loving and pleasant toeach other in our daily lives and if we use the power of our minds tothink love, peace, and harmony, we break the very foundations that holdthe pyramid of control together - fear, guilt, resentment, judgment2,competition and aggression.Today our generations are being offered an opportunityunprecedented for at least twelve thousand years and probably far, farlonger. It is the opportunity for a mass evacuation of the human prison.If we choose to grasp it, we can be part of the Great Cleansing of PlanetEarth and the human mind which so many are now experiencing. It isthe moment we have prepared for over many lifetimes. This opportunityis not only for some “chosen people” or chosen few No-one is chosen.We make the choices ourselves. This gathering transformation is foranyone and everyone. Once again, YOU are in control. You alwayswere and you always are.2 I think it is worth defining what I mean by judgment, and therefore being nonjudgmental. Ido not mean looking the other way when we see things we don’t like because to say anythingwould be “judgmental”. That form of non-judgmentalism denies the right to have opinionsand express them. By non-judgment, I mean to say what we think about attitudes andbehaviour while realising that we are not challenging the people involved, but the thoughtpatterns and states of mind which control those people."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"101Chapter 6Set The Genie FreeI imagine a wine bottle standing on a light.

It alsoincludes all those who accept and feed the victim mentality and the‘’scientists’’ who tell us that not only is the bottle tightly closed, thereis nowhere outside to escape to even if we could. The bottle is all thatexists. These messages constantly increase the energy which powersthe light and disempowers the people. We are the genie in the bottleand it is time to escape. The cork was never there, we were just dupedinto believing it was.The symbolism of the bottle is very appropriate because we exist, atthis level of ourselves, anyway, in a vortex of energy which is shapednot unlike a bottle (Figure 4 overleaf). This spiral of multidimensionalenergy is like a cinema screen on which the game, the ride, we callphysical life is played out. You could imagine this vortex of experienceas a pyramid with a circle at its peak (Figure 5 - see page 104). Youcan see in a cinema how the projection of the picture is like a pyramid.When it leaves the projector the picture is very small, but by the time itreaches the screen, it has expanded massively. Look at a spotlight in atheatre and you will see the same principle. The beam of light widensthe further it travels.

TheGlobal Elite and the cult of the All Seeing Eye are the physicalresponsibilities of the negative extreme in this positive-negative, male-female duality, but they are still part of the whole and therefore part ofus. Oneness is the collective mind that created a vortex which separatedthe elements within the Oneness. It was designed as a spiritualuniversity and a very tough school. It is within that vortex that ourdense physical world exists. It is one of perhaps nine time-space planesor dimensions - “worlds” - within the vortex. These planes are the manymansions in my father’s house” which Y’shua (1esus) is reputed to havetalked about. All these levels are connected vibrationally and whathappens to one affects them all. They each vibrate to a different “note”(wavelength), but all the notes are part of the same tune. Each higherdimension is responsible for guiding the one below which, again, iswhere the ancient idea of the guiding “gods” originates - from thedimension above ours. We are in a three dirnensional world or the ThirdDimension which is near the bottom of the pyramid. Each dimensionhas a “physical” level (gradually becoming less dense the closer theyare to Oneness) and a non-physical level to where consciousness returnsbetween physical incarnations. The diagram is very simple and thereare many more wavelengths, worlds, and subtleties involved, of course,but it summarises the general theme.When I say that we are God and that all is God, I don’t mean that weare all at the same level of understanding. Within this infinite mind/energy that is everything, are infinite levels of love, knowledge, andwisdom. At the highest vibration, at the heart of God, is what I call theSource Consciousness. This is the mind from which all else has come.What is the Source? The Source is Love. And Love is Oneness, thebalance of all. How do we return to the Source? We love ourselves andwe love every other expression of God. We love and become love.Loving God means loving everything because everything is God. Thatincludes the Global Elite and those exposed in chapter four. No-oneneeds love more than they do.Understanding Oneness in the deepest sense comes fromexperiencing the division of Oneness. You only understand the balancebetween hot and cold by experiencing both hot and cold. You onlyknow when you have achieved balance because you have experiencedimbalance.

That symbolic “outbreath” wasthe projection of the vortex from the Oneness that caused theseparation of male and female, positive and negative, which, when inharmony, make One. The “outbreath” of separation and creation is themale energy and the “inbreath”, the nurturing back to Oneness is thefemale energy now re-emerging on Planet Earth. As with the cinemaprojector, the further away from Oneness the vortex travelled, thewider it expanded and the greater the separation of “opposites”. Thewider that separation the slower the energy vibrated and so at thebottom levels of the vortex (that symbolic bottle) the dense physicalworld formed. What we call “matter” is only energy condensed to aslow vibration.You can see this expressed in the world around us. The rocks operateon a longer wavelength, a very slow vibration, and so their matter isvery “solid”. Our bodies vibrate to a shorter, quicker, frequency and sothey are less “solid” than a rock. Our consciousness vibrates on an evenquicker wavelength and is, therefore, out of range of the body’sphysical senses. We have to expand our minds, increase our vibratoryrate, and use our psychic “third eye” sight if we wish to see such levels.The task of those who chose to take part in this learning experimentwas, and still is, to experience division and through that to bring those“opposites” back into balance within us. As that balance is achieved,our vibratory rate quickens and we ascend up the frequency levelswithin the pyramid/vortex towards our real home - Oneness.Symbolically, the Prodigal Son returns home to “the Father”.Let us get this straight. People talk about living in the “real world”as if the divisions, pain, and control of this dense physical planet werethe “real world”. That is the last thing it is. The “real world”, if youwant to put it like that, is the level of highly evolved existence calledOneness. The world you see through your eyes is a holographic, threedimensional, virtual reality game created by Oneness as a vast learningexperience. When you look through your eyes it is like donning one ofthose virtual reality helmets you get with computer games. We arelooking at a cinema screen, that’s all.

Creating a hologram is very straightforward. Also, every part of a hologram is an image of the whole. Theonly thing you lose, the smaller you go, is detail. That is exactly whatwe are, a part of the gigantic hologram we call the universe and we area smaller image of the whole of that hologram - the universe. We justdon’t manifest all of the detail. In the same way, every cell in our bodyholds the information contained in the whole body. As above so below,as they say. Everything is a reflection of everything, no matter howsmall. There is actually no here or there, only everywhere. The hereand there are merely the section of everywhere that our senses areperceiving at any moment. If you walk around a department store youare only seeing one department at a time. But go outside (symbolic ofexpanding our consciousness to higher levels) and you can see thewhole building which contains all the departments.Oneness created the foundations of this time space reality, the thoughtform and vibrational interaction which built the “movie set”. But it iswe who make the film. It is we who decide which parts we will play,who with, and in what setting. It is we who write the script and createa physical reality to match the imagination we have of ourselves andour part in the picture. It can be a nice family film full of love andrespect or it can be a horror movie. We, you, all of us, decide that. No-one else. No “God”, no “random accidents”, we do it. You think yourlife is a horror movie? It will be. You think of yourself as the guy whogets shot early in the film? You will be. You think of yourself as one ofthose who end up laughing and happy in the last scene? You will be.What part do you want to play? Then think it and live it. Great, yougot the job. Cue camera - action!Now, let’s stop fighting each other and condemning each other. Letus instead love ourselves, love each other, find balance, and get out ofhere! Let’s go!The opportunity to do just that is being presented to us like neverbefore since the vortex was created. “God” is breathing in. We are beingpulled back towards Oneness - if we choose to go. The effects ofdividing Oneness so comprehensively were possibly underestimated.The division has become a prison within which the prisoners are somesmerised by the cell that they can conceive of no other reality.Symbolically, I see people existing in an eggshell (Figure 6).

We don’t have to “seek”enlightenment, it is sitting there patiently waiting for us. It has alwaysbeen there. Ignorance and enlightenment share the same space as eachother. We simply need to remove the barrier, the shell of conditionedthought, which has caused the disconnection from our infinite self andthe Source Of All That Is. Crack the eggshell, shatter it into a thousandpieces by changing the way you see yourself, open your heart and mind,and all levels of you will be reunited. A little help is required to speedthis process and that help is here, not least in the form of“extraterrestrial” activity which will expand enormously in the yearsahead until we eventually interact with people from other time-spacedimensions in the same way that we mix with people of differentcountries on Earth. But, once again, within this free-will virtual reality,it is we who must decide if we wish to accept such support.Each time-space dimension within the vortex/pyramid is sharing thesame space as all the others, just as radio and television frequenciesshare the same space. They operate in different “worlds” unaware ofthe other’s existence. However, frequencies very close on the radioband can interfere with each other. So it is within the vortex. On thedimension next to ours, what I will call the Fourth Dimension, are twoopposing forces, male-female, positive-negative, which have foughtover hundreds of thousands of our years for control of this densephysical world. Two of their manifestations on Earth were thecivilisations known as Lemuria and Atlantis. This battle on the FourthDimension has been symbolised in ancient texts as the “battle in theheavens” and the “battle of the Gods”. We see it symbolised byHollywood in films like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. It is atussle between two elements of Oneness separated within the vortex.Light and Dark is the way that some people describe it, but it is reallytwo shades of imbalance at war with each other. And it is this sometimesturbulent fourth dimension which has the role in the movie of guidingour third dimension back to Oneness!

It is from this fourth dimension andhigher that at least most of the “UFOs” come, both positive andnegative. The scale of the UFO-extraterrestrial cover up is extraordinaryand so is the manipulation of this phenomenon by the Global Elite.The fear of extraterrestrial “invasion” is being used to justify a worldgovernment and army. Hollywood films are being produced with thistheme as part of the conditioning. The genuine space craft have theability to change their vibratory state and “switch” dimensions. Whenthey do, they disappear to our physical senses. They have not actuallydisappeared, they have merely left our time-space reality - thefrequency range in which our physical sight and other senses operate.It’s like moving the radio dial. Many of these craft and beings mighteven be thought forms transmitted from the Fourth Dimension whichonly manifest as “craft”.The Earth, the solar system, and the universe, exist on all the time-space dimensions within the pyramid. While the Moon and the planetsof the solar system may seem to be lifeless to our physical senses, weare only seeing them from our dimension. On other dimensions thosesame planets are teeming havens of life. The same with the stars.

But it isstill the same multidimensional Earth. Our consciousness is alsomultidimensional and levels of us exist on these other dimensions, too!We are like those Russian dolls, one inside the other, but we havebecome disconnected from most of them which is why our perspectivehas been so limited. I remember how a very sensitive psychic friendonce had a vision of me addressing what she called millions of people.“It is you” she said “But it is you on another level, not this one”. Itseemed a strange idea at the time, but not anymore.

Each is another actorplaying its chosen part on this multiscreen “cinema” within the vortex,learning and evolving with each new experience. Not only did thepyramidic movie projection separate into “worlds” of experience, itseparated the Oneness of those who chose to take part in theexperiment. As the pyramid rolls back into Oneness and we rise up thedimensions, we become One with each of our separated levels in turnuntil we are “whole” again. At that moment, we will be back to ourstate of Oneness and we will have access to the experience and learningthat every level of us has absorbed. And, come to that, what every levelof everyone else has absorbed within the vortex. The learning will beincredible and all of creation will evolve as a result. It is like onestudent separating into many students who then go off to differentuniversities, studying different subjects, and experiencing differentlifestyles, attitudes, and ways of hating and loving. Then they all returnto each other and swap notes and stories. So while we may beexperiencing a positive life here, another aspect of us may be a “villain”somewhere else. It’s just an experience and it makes the judgment ofothers so ludicrous. While I challenge states of mind like the “far-Right”, Christian Patriotism, and the Robot Radicals, the people tunedto those mental and emotional states are having an experience fromwhich they, and all of us, will learn. It’s a game, a ride. We are eachother, no matter what any of those “others” may be doing. Theextraterrestrials who are dubbed “aliens” are actually other aspects ofourselves. They are not “alien” at all. They are part of us. Thesevortexes of learning in specific, artificially created, conditions can befound throughout the infinite mind we call God. They are vortexes,eddies, within the river of consciousness that flows to infinity. Thesevortexes of experience allow God (us) to experience His/Her self andunderstand the extent of His/Her potential: we are all Oneconsciousness experiencing itself subjectively.If we are to evolve, to balance and raise ourselves back up the levelsto Oneness, we need to remember who and what we are. Without that,we will remain like the moth in the bottle, unaware of the means ofescape. And the pyramid of experience cannot roll back into Onenessagain until the dense physical level moves. It will continue to be a leadweight holding down all the rest and the time has arrived for theexperiment to move on.

We are theprodigal son who left “the Father” (Oneness) to experience and thenlost his way. But, just as the prodigal son returned to a welcoming“father”, so we have the opportunity now to do the same. It is my strongbelief that a “team” of “volunteers” came out of the Oneness to helpwith the transition from separation and division to balance andharmony. These multidimensional volunteers (consciousness) areoperating on all dimensions within the vortex offering informationwhich will help people to remember that they are taking part in a game.It is not real. The toughest task is faced by those operating in this densephysical world because the density has added to the spiritual amnesiawhich has disconnected people from their eternal memory. They haveforgotten who they are, where they came from, and what the hell theyare doing here. I think that even some of this volunteer consciousnesshas become so hypnotised by the light at the bottom of the bottle thatit, too, has forgotten what it is here to do! Many are called, but fewserve. Enough have stayed awake, however, to do the job. Examplesof this volunteer consciousness can be found throughout history andthey include some, though most certainly not all, of the figures whichlater had religions founded in their names. Y’shua (1esus) was possiblyamong them and the difficulties he encountered were caused byinterference from the Fourth Dimension. When he left this world, hiswords were turned on their head and used as the foundations for areligion, inspired from the Fourth Dimension, which has been theepitome of everything he came to challenge.Life on this dense physical dimension has been made more difficultby the interference from the Fourth Dimension. It is from there, as Ihave indicated, that the so called “gods” of ancient legend originate.Elements of this consciousness have manipulated this world throughoutknown history and before. It is the “Prison Warder” consciousness, as Icall it in ... and the truth shall set you free, and I believe it has a physicalextraterrestrial expression on, and under, the Earth today. What is thecommon theme that connects the thought control of religion going backthousands of years and the thought control of today’s political-economic-military-media-industrial complex? The manipulation byelements in the Fourth Dimension via the minds of those here in theThird and maybe even more directly as a physical form. The negativeconsciousness operating on the Fourth Dimension created, eitherthough direct incarnation or thought manipulation, the religions and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112various creeds which have controlled, divided, and ruled this world forthousands of years. It was also the source of the belief in this-world-is-all-there-is “science”. It was behind the creation of the educationsystem, the legal (in)justice system, the wars, the interest-on-moneybanking cartels, and it is the force that is pressing, via its physicalpuppets or direct, incarnate, representatives, for a world government,central bank, currency, and army, together with a microchippedpopulation.The Global Elite are either incarnations or physical projections ofthis extreme negative consciousness which people call Satanic, or, inother cases, they are possessed by it. So it has been for thousands ofyears going back to ancient Egypt, Babylon, etc. These FourthDimensional “Satanic” manipulators have their symbolism in all areasof society because they created all the vehicles of control. One of themain channels of interaction between the Fourth Dimension and itsThird Dimensional representatives and puppets is the upper levels ofthe global secret society network in which the initiation ceremoniescan create a vibrational connection between the initiate (puppet) andthe Fourth Dimensional manipulators. Symbols like the Pyramid, AllSeeing Eye and many others which go back into ancient times are stillthose of the secret society network today because they are the Satanicsymbols of this highly imbalanced element of the Fourth Dimension.The Satanic rites and grotesque human sacrifices still going on todayare designed to create huge amounts of extreme negative energy onwhich this consciousness feeds. This “Satanic” consciousness isextreme negative energy and so the more of this energy that can beproduced in the three dimensional world, the more power theconsciousness has to manipulate this planet. Humanity is then operatingon a negative vibrational playing field within the vibrational range ofthe “Satanic” consciousness. This is why animal and human sacrificeswhich abound throughout human history still continue today. Some ofthis even goes on openly. What is a slaughterhouse if not a place forthe sacrifice of animals, thus creating enormous terror and pain -extreme negative energy? The spilling of blood is very important tothis consciousness and its Global Elite/extraterrestrial puppets on Earth.The United Nations building in New York is built on land given freeby the Rockefellers. It is the site of a former slaughterhouse. TheSatanic force is symbolised by the All Seeing Eye of Lucifer at the peakof the pyramid and it operates through the Global Elite. The same forcehas been controlling and manipulating the planet for at least hundreds"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"113of thousands of years, probably a lot longer. But it is vital that we don’treact to this consciousness with hatred, fear and aggression. It needsour love because it is the absence of love that has led to its currentimbalanced state.

They are its power.At their highest levels those who control the secret society networkknowingly serve their Fourth Dimensional and extraterrestrial“masters”. Nor is it coincidence that the Pyramid and All Seeing Eyeare on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States and on thedollar bill. Representatives and puppets for the negative elements ofthe Fourth Dimension were behind the creation of the United Statesand control it to this day, as they do the global banking system, theintelligence agencies, political system, the media, and so on. Somepeople believe that another symbol of the Fourth Dimensionalmanipulators is the black gown. What is the attire worn by Christianclergy and representatives of many other religions? A black gown. Whatis the colour of the legal profession, barristers, many judges and suchlike? Black. What is the symbol of success in the education system orthe top of the teaching profession? A black gown. The FourthDimensional thought manipulators inspired all of these institutions ofcontrol. In Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back what was the colourworn by the “baddie”, Darth Vader? Black with a Nazi helmet,appropriately, because the Fourth Dimensional manipulators were theforce behind the Nazis, too. If you read . . .and the truth shall set youfree, you will appreciate how and why the Nazis were created. DarthVader was the symbol of what I have called the Luciferic or SatanicConsciousness, the Fourth Dimensional source which has manipulatedour three dimensional world. Hollywood, especially the films by StevenSpielberg like Raiders Of The Lost Ark, are full of symbolism whichbetrays a wide knowledge of the true story behind the manipulation ofthis world.The mentality known as the Illuminati or Global Elite, the few whocontrol the direction of the world by conditioning the massconsciousness, have their origin, guidance and motivation in the FourthDimension and its extraterrestrial expression. This is how the sameforce that was responsible for the creation of religion is also the forcebehind the plan to microchip everyone and link them to a globalcomputer.

Next time you come, you can pay bymicrochip.Those imbalanced elements within the Fourth Dimension can onlycontrol and direct events in this one if we give our minds away. That iswhy all the creations df these manipulators, be it religion, finance,politics or ‘’science’’, involve the hijacking of the human psyche. In thisway they also hijack humanity’s sense of self, its sense of reality, and itsphysical experience. When we take our power back and stop acceptinganother’s belief of what we should be, we remove the ability of the fewto mind-control the “masses”, the mass human consciousness. Beliefsare limitations of vision and prisons of the mind. We believe too muchand feel too little. Only when we follow our feelings, instead of denyingthem, will we break the grip the manipulators have on so many psyches.Go with the flow without fear of what others will think. The mostpowerful way to set ourselves free of the thinking, believing, fearing,intellect, is to celebrate our own uniqueness, allow everyone else to dothe same, and never seek to impose what we believe on another. I sayanything goes unless there is imposition or pressure of any kind onanyone to do the same. That’s freedom.Part of the vibratory transformation now unfolding on this planet andthis time-space reality in general, is to cleanse the negative energies inthe Fourth Dimension and remove their abuse of human frec will.

We are in the last years of this control and with itsinterdimensional power source rapidly on the wane, if not alreadywithdrawn, the Global Elite will find it ever more difficult to achieveits end of global, political, economic and spiritual power over amicrochipped, robotic population. The Global Elite have reached theirpeak of power because the human population have reached the depthsof giving their power away. From now, the only way is up. This isalready apparent to gathering millions who are awakening to a newvision of themselves and their destiny as their eggshells crack and theyare reunited with higher dimensions of themselves.Energies are being transmitted down from Oneness throughout thepyramid. These energies, thought forms, are designed to harmonise andbalance the separation. As this happens the movie sets created by theinteraction of separated polarities begin to change because thecircumstances which created them are changing. If the dense physicalworld is created by the separation of negative and positive, female andmale, which slow the vibrations and form dense matter, then as the scaleof that separation is reduced, the vibrations will quicken and the densephysical world ceases to be. The movie sets manifest an ever closerconnection with Oneness as the energies move closer to that state ofbeing. Conflict becomes less, love and understanding becomes moreprevalent, and so on until we are back at the balance point we camefrom: Oneness. Game over. What shall we play now?This change is already well advanced. It has been creeping upon usunnoticed, just as the cracks in a dam can go unnoticed until just beforethe whole structure is about to give way. For those with eyes that cansee beyond the physical illusions, the cracks are now very wide indeedand the dam is beginning to sway. A tidal wave of change is upon us andwe can swim with that tide or against it. That is our choice, but theconsequences of this choice will be very, very different. We can let go ofthe rigidity and limitations of our reality and potential, unload theemotional sewage in our subconscious, and fly, vibrationally, out throughthe top of the bottle and home. Or we can continue to be mesmerised bythe light at the bottom and wage war against the vibrational change theentire bottle is experiencing. In my view; the consequences of that choicewill be deeply unpleasant, but it’s a choice we all have every right tomake. These high vibrational energies have travelled down the pyramidfrom Oneness, affecting and transforming the other dimensions withinthe vortex. Hence, the imbalances and divisions on the Fourth"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116Dimension are being healed, and now that process is filtering down tothis dense physical world of ours. These energies are having a gatheringeffect on the consciousness of humanity and life on Earth. Again weare back to electromagnetic energy fields and the sea of energy withwhich we constantly interact. As higher energies are introduced whichraise the vibrational state of the global energy fields, everything is beingaffected, not least human thought and emotions.It may not seem to be obvious when you watch the TV news that weare in the process of transforming this planet from division and conflictto peace and harmony. There seems to be more unrest than ever. Thereis a reason for that. Whatever your state of being, it will usually settleinto a sort of equilibrium. Put something on only one side of the scalesand after a while the scales will settle down into what you might call abalanced imbalance. The scales will be pushed down much further onone side, but they will eventually stop moving up and down and cometo rest in that position. If you then put something of equal weight onthe other side to balance the scales, the balance does not comeimmediately. Once again, the scales jump around for a while until theysettle down into the new situation, in this case, balance. So wheneverthe scales change, it involves a rather chaotic period of readjustment.But in truth it is not chaos at all, it is a natural, and essential,prerequisite to change. If you take the symbolism of the scales to bethe energy fields of the Earth and ourselves, it expresses very well whatwe are experiencing now. The old structures (balanced imbalance) havereached the end of the line and they are crumbling in the face of theenergies ushering in the new world and new Earth (balance). I will talkabout the effects on humanity a little later, but the effects on the planetand the systems of nature are already apparent. The increasinglyobvious changes in world weather patterns are not the result of the socalled Greenhouse Effect in my view. They are being caused by thevibrational changes affecting the Earth’s energy fields. The scales aremoving. The effects on the weather will continue to grow in thetransitional period until, possibly, a pole shift completes thetransformation from old energy field (time-space dimension) to new.These high powered energies, which manifest in part as a phenomenaknown as the Photon Belt,2 are now being measured even by1 It is also important to note, however, that the Elite now have technology to manipulate theweather for their own ends.2 See .. and the truth shall set you free and The Robots’ Rebellion."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"117conventional “science”. According to the London Daily Telegraph ofJuly 5th 1995, energies have been measured that have shattered popular“scientific” belief. The article said:“Something out there - no-one knows what - is hurling high energyparticles around the universe, in this case the most energetic everobserved by scientists... Not even the power released by the mostpowerful exploding stars could account for them. Indeed conventionaltheory says such particles should not exist...These energies, known by “science” as cosmic rays, are normallymeasured in the range of millions of electron volts power. Since 1992,the article said, they have been measured in a range of up to 320 billionbillion electron volts. And these are only the energies that human“science” has so far developed the technology to measure. Most of thechange is happening on vibrational levels unknown and unmeasuredby ‘’science’’. But the human mind, heart, and emotions can feel themfar more sensitively than any technology. The Photon Belt, a field ofhighly, highly charged energy, is, I believe, responsible in part for thisincredible difference in the gathering power of the energies beingmeasured. Many people believe that the solar system is now movinginto the Photon Belt and the effect of these energies will be felt moreand more in terms of physical changes (weather, geological unrest) and,the root of all change, the awakening human mind. Another enormoussource of change is the spiritual and physical heart of the solar system,the Sun. I was interested to read about the work of the researcher andwriter, Maurice Cotterell, who studied the cycles of sun spot activitythe times when the Sun is emitting very powerful magnetic energieswhich travel to the Earth on what is known as the solar wind.3 He latercame across the amazing mathematical system of numbers and symbolsleft by the ancient Mayan people in Central America which claimed tomeasure the cycles of human and Earth evolution. He was fascinatedto realise that his cycles of sun spot (magnetic) activity correspondedvery closely with the Mayan cycles of human evolution, even thoseprojected over thousands of years. This was no “coincidence”. Life isthe interaction of magnetic energy fields. Change the magnetism andyou change the nature of the energy field.

That is happening now to Planet Earth.Look at so many of the ancient prophecies about great changes onEarth, be it native peoples like the Hopi tribe in the United States, theMaya, or psychics like Edgar Cayce or Nostradamus, and they point toenormous change in the time period we are living through today.According to the Maya, the last Great Cycle of the Earth’s evolutionbegan in 3114 BC and it is due to end in 2012 when another, verydifferent, period of evolution will begin. Again same story, same basictimescale. The incoming energies have already awakened very largenumbers of people to see the world and themselves through far moreopen and perceptive eyes by helping them reconnect with higher levelsof themselves which, up to this point, they had shut out. Those numbersare growing rapidly by the day. Everyone can begin that same journey.It’s only a choice.No matter what the scale of change unfolding, this is not a time topanic. It is never a time to panic! Life is forever and we are goingthrough a cycle within the vortex which will allow us to begin thejourney home to Oneness. Just as the “death” of Autumn and Winter isfollowed by the “birth” and “life” of Spring and Summer, so in thegreater cycles of evolution, whole dimensions go through this sequenceof “death” and “rebirth”. Spring, new birth and abundance, will followthis period of breakdown and change. No worries. How bumpy orspiritually orgasmic the transition will be depends upon you and meand our imagination of ourselves and the “future”. If we think it willbe catastrophic, so it will be.

That is easier than itmay sound because our consciousness naturally gravitates towardsOneness, just as the deep sea diver would float to the surface withoutthe weights to hold him down.Our “weights” are the emotional gunge in our subconscious, ourprogrammed sense of self and reality, and the endless mind-numbingclaptrap that assaults our eyes and ears via the media, the education(indoctrination) system, politicians, economists, and all the other minddoctors selling us their view of what our reality should be. In short, theeggshell. Without those influences, that weight on our mind andemotions, the bird would have flown a long time ago. These are theinfluences that create the light at the bottom of the bottle, hypuotisingus and keeping us in ignorance of our true and infinite self. I rememberlistening to a tape of the late Bill Hicks, the American comedian Imentioned before. He was talking about a film called Basic Instinct.His summary of the film: “Piece a shit”. However, great debate ensuedabout the picture. Was it too this or too that? Much of this “debate”was hyped to promote the movie and Bill Hicks offered the followingadvice:It’s a piece a shit, walk away.If humanity did that more often, it would not waste its energy dayafter day on irrelevant debate and argument over “issues” that are onlythere to divert us from what really matters - our own evolution out ofignorance and our own ability to love and be loved.

(Author leaves word processor in order to vomit.)In Hollywood, the home of self and mass delusion, there are moreface lifts and hair transplants per square mile than probably anywhereelse on the planet. It is no wonder. The Hollywood mentality is theultimate illusion and it is obsessed with the physical senses. Its industry,its very reason for being, is based on illusion, with false backdrops,false sunlight, and plastic, artificial emotions, as two actors who can’tstand each other come together for a warm caress. My darling, I loveyou (cut!)... you asshole. Hollywood is a wonder to observe andsymbolises magnificently the illusions that keep the human mindenslaved. It sells to the mass psyche its version of history and of whatis beautiful, successful, and important. This invariably relates toarchetypal images of butch men with firm faces and plenty of hair (realor otherwise) and ideally shaped women straight out of wardrobe andmake up. Some actors know all this isn’t real, but many forget to leavethe illusions on the set. They live them and take on that celluloid worldas their reality. It is a world of fear, insincerity and insecurity: you werebrilliant darling, what was I like? Oh Dorothy darling, I’m so glad youwon the Oscar (lucky bitch). Their sense of self comes not from whatthey are, but from how they are perceived by those who control theillusion machine and by an audience conditioned by the illusionmachine.

What’s more if your friends and family havebeen conditioned to believe the same (and most of them have) you feelan even greater pressure to aspire to that manufactured image ofphysical perfection. I saw a documentary about Hollywood men inwhich this guy’s sex life had been destroyed by an operation that wentwrong... an operation to fill his willy with fat from another part of hisbody to make it look bigger.Uhhhhhh!

Our bodies are a reflection of our sense of self. They are aphysical expression of our mind and emotions. You can see in the facesof people if they have been through extreme emotional pain. It is writtenin their features. People who eat a lot and create bigger bodies forthemselves are invariably manifesting in their eating habits an emotionaltorment of some kind. For them it’s food, for others its drink or drugs,just a means to escape temporarily from the emotion they wish to shutout. Our minds control our bodies and our bodies will reflect our state ofmind. I have a close friend who has an astonishing connection betweenmind and body Her whole face changes with her changing emotions. It’sremarkable to see. The faces of the mind-controlled human robots oftenchange as they switch “personalities”. If we feel good about ourselveswe will transmit the same energy to our bodies. If we feel unloved andunwanted, our bodies will manifest that, also. The same goes for aging.We don’t have to age as we do. We expect to age because that is ourreality and so we age. As we evolve towards Oneness, the aging processwill slow down and we will live for what appears to us now to beincredible lengths of time. Impossible? Nothing, NOTHING, isimpossible. Incidentally, returning to that Hollywood theme, those actorswho fear losing their looks or their hair are far more likely to lose them.We attract to us what we most fear because overcoming fear is essentialto our evolution. Relax. Whatever you are is OK. It’s your role in themovie at this moment. You are what you are and you can change whatyou are by changing what you think you are. That, too, applies to ourbodies. Anyway, you chose your body before incarnation in theknowledge of what that would mean in terms of size, shape and lengthof appendage. You did that for an experience that you believed wouldspeed your understanding and evolution. It is just a temporary body -you are eternal mind and spirit. But if we get caught into the trap ofaccepting the manipulators version of what is normal and “sexy”, wewill have a lifetime of diminished self worth if we don’t have a bodythat conforms to that.Fundamentally related to the desire for some physical “perfection”or “norm” is the great myth that happiness can be pursued. The pursuitof happiness is even part of the United States Constitution and it is asystem-serving device which encourages people to run around liketerrified chickens chasing something that simply cannot be caught."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"123People are duped into pursuing happiness with a bigger fridge, or thelatest car, or a bigger house. “If I just had this or that,” they say “I’d behappy.” But when they get it, they’re still not happy. Most people gothrough their entire lives without being truely happy. Of course theremay be moments when they feel blissful, but those moments are sofleeting. Their “happiness” is normally measured by levels ofuDhappiness. The harder you try to find happiness, the more elusive itbecomes. The reason is simple: if you are in a constant state of pursuinghappiness you can never be happy. Your “now” experience is alwaysthe pursuing of happiness, never happiness itself. Your happiness isalways in the future and not in your now. Its like sitting on one of thosehorses on the fairground rides. It doesn’t matter how fast the carouselis turning, you never get any closer to the horse in front. John Lennononce wrote that life is what happens to you while you’re busy makingother plans. In the same way, happiness is constantly passing us bybecause we are spending all our time pursuing it instead of “being” it.The only way to be happy is to be happy. That is a state of mind withinyour control whatever you are doing. It doesn’t require a new Ferrarior an extension to your dangly bits. Happiness is not a pursuing, it is abeing. The harder you chase it, the further you push it away. It can belikened to chasing a butterfly. The more desperately you charge at it,the more it will elude you. But if you stop trying so hard, lay down onthe grass and relax, there is a chance it will just come and land on yourshoulder. A similar example is the swimmer trying to reach a ball inthe water. The harder and more desperately he swims, the more hedisturbs the water and the ball gets further and further away. If,however, he is patient and relaxes, he will reach the ball using a lotless effort and emotion. We are called human beings and yet we havebecome human “doings”. We are conditioned to chase everything,including, most significantly happiness. This constant state of pursuitobscures the truth that life is a lot easier than we are conditioned tobelieve and does not require the enormous expenditure of physical andemotional energy that we observe every-day. Instead of chasing ourdreams, we can use our multidimensional powers to attract our dreamsto us. Flowing with our intuition is a great deal more effective thanliving our lives as if someone hadjust shouted “fire”.Another thing that hooks us in emotionally and seeps our energy forno good reason is the way we are offended by what others say or do.People are offended by different things because they are programmedby different Hassle-Free Zones (a religion, a political “ism”, what we"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"124were told was “right and “wrong” by our parents). What offends oneperson won’t offend another because they will have been conditioned tobe offended by different things. Tell a Christian that Jesus was an assholeand they will be mortally offended. A Muslim will not. Tell the Muslimthat Mohammed was an asshole and he’ll be offended, but not theChristian. It’s all in the mind. There are, however, some universal tabooswhich seem to offend vast numbers of people of all beliefs becausesociety as a whole, the main Hassle-Free Zone, has decided that weshould be offended by them. So we are. We do as we are told like fullypaid up robots. There may be some people reading this book who havebeen offended by my use of the word shit. If you have, it might be worthasking yourself why you are offended. Shit is merely the one syllablesound which has been accepted to mean a substance we all produce andif we didn’t produce it we would eventually explode. Very messy. I usethe word shit because the nature of the substance it describes is brilliantlysymbolic of the propaganda we are pressured to accept as our reality onthis planet. If anyone is offended by the word shit, it is not because I ambeing offensive because that is not my intention. It is because you havechosen to be offended. It is all taking place in your mind, not mine. Evenif I was trying to be offensive, you still don’t have to take it on and beaffected by it. You have a choice. Well now I’ve offended you, I mightas well go all the way In for a penny in for a pound - you know me. Howabout the word fuck?My GOD! Did you hear what he just said?Youknow...ffff...the”F”word.Disgusting! Outrageous! What an awful man!I said the “F” word? Oh, you mean fuck? Yes, that’s right, I did. So?It’s funny that the same people who do not get offended by Americanwarplanes bombing the crap out of people in the Middle East, Vietnam,and elsewhere, killing children by the score, will be breathless in theirindignation when someone says the word “fuck”. The end of the worldis not ushered in by warplanes and atomic bombs, but by people saying“fuck”. “The moral fibre of society is crumbling. Bring back hangingand conscription, that’ll sort it.

Wecall two pieces of bread placed together a sandwich because a guycalled Sandwich was supposed to have “invented” them. What if hisname had been Willie? Or Sidebottom? We’d now be eating willies orsidebottoms. It’s just a word, a sound. What if the slang word for sexualintercourse had been, by a quirk of fate, sandwich? And what if theword for two pieces of bread placed together had turned out to be fuck?Today if you go into a sandwich bar and ask for a cheese and tomatosandwich no-one turns a hair. But if you ask for a fucking sandwich,everyone is mortally offended. Imagine if the words were the other wayround, as could quite possibly have happened. You would then go intoa fucking bar and ask for a cheese and tomato fuck. No-one would turna hair. But if you asked for a sandwiching fuck, everyone would bemortally offended.My GOD!

I actually think the word is a travestyof the true experience of sexual union, which at its peak, with the rightperson at the right time, is for me, the ultimate experience in this time-space reality. But it is also a very expressive word which conveysbrilliantly your state of mind when you drop a hammer on your foot, orthe car won’t start, or the events of the day have wound you up. A fewmore “fucks” and tears and a few less stiff upper lips and a lot of peoplewould occupy their bodies for a great deal longer.

There, are you anybetter or worse a person? No. You have just shaped your mouth andlips to say a word, just as you do when you say sandwich. It is just asound. It is the intent behind a word, not the word itself, that is positiveor negative.The way so many are offended by the sight of the naked human bodynever ceases to make me chuckle. Religion has conditioned thecollective psyche to such a degree that to display what we were bornwith, live with, and die with - our physical body - is considered highlyoffensive and an arrestable offence! It is illegal to show your willy orfuzzy bits on a beach, but legal to blow the shit out of defencelesspeople in faraway countries under the banner of freedom and peace.To say our “values” have become desperately confused is theunderstatement of eternity. This is one reason why I decided to appearnaked on the front cover and even then I had to hide my doo dah witha sticker to allow the book to be displayed in the shops. Bookshops, itseems, have been designated doo dah-free zones. It’s just a body forChrist’s sake and we all have one. If you are offended by a naked bodyagain you might ask why you are offended because that’s your choice,your problem, and no-one else’s. The same applies when people attackus or hurl abuse at us. We can take on their problem or leave them todeal with it. If they have a problem with us, that’s exactly the situation.They have a problem. It only becomes our problem if we choose to gethooked in and be offended by what they say or do. When we reactnegatively to someone who offends or hurts us, we are making a two-way magnetic connection with them. We become hooked into theirvibe. Their problem is now ours. We are playing on their negativeplaying field, on their terms, and by their rules. When we choose notto be offended or hurt, there is no magnetic connection and so we don’ttake on another’s problem or create a problem that isn’t really there.You don’t have to be offended, it’s up to you. But for those who areeasily offended I can only say:It’s a human waste product, walk away.Another irrelevance we take terribly seriously is the so called“education” system. It is nothing of the kind. It is an indoctrination"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"127system, a key form of mind-control. Its job is to mould ourconsciousness into the shape of a four-legged animal from which weobtain wool. Teachers pass through the indoctrination system and theygo off to schools and universities to indoctrinate the next generation.At the peak of the “education” pyramid, this is done knowingly but theoverwhelming majority of teachers and lecturers are just programmedpeople programming their students. It is a self-perpetuating cycle.Those teachers who know they are caught in a web of indoctrinationand conditioning only go so far in pointing this out because if they saywhat they really think they are out of a job. In the United Kingdom, wehave a “National Curriculum” which insists that all children andstudents are the same, or must be made to be so. Everyone is taught thesame subjects in basically the same way and the measurement ofsuccess of both system and student is based on how adept they are attransferring mental garbage from mind to paper. Sorry how adept theyare at passing “exams”. The education system is the mind-mouldproduction line for the Hassle-Free Zone. The curriculum is, in itsthemes and at its core, merely the view of life and ourselves which theElite and their manipnlators on the Fourth Dimension wish us to have.Students are taught about politics as if democracy was freedom andchoice actually existed; they are taught that the financial system is saneand sensible and not an enormous sleight of hand; they are told thatthis world is “real” and not just an illusion created by thought - theirthoughts; they are conditioned for the world of “work” and a mindnumbing life of serving the system. One slave reporting for duty, sir!One mind for the use and abuse of, sir! Atteeen-tion.A most powerful form of reality conditioning is what is called“history”. What is really meant by that term is the official version ofhistory How we see the past has a massive impact on how we see thepresent and the future. Official history tells a story of black and whiteevents in which the good guys fight the bad and win victories for“freedom”. Hiding what really happened in the past is essential for themanipulators if they are to hide what is happening now. Nowhere arestudents taught, or even asked to consider the possibility, that the samepeople might have been manipulating and funding all “sides” to createdivide and rule, start wars, and change the nature of the post-warsociety. Even though this is provable, children and students all overthe world continue to be told a very different, manufactured, story.Teachers are told this version is true when they go through the systemand they tell their students it is true when they become an indoctrinator"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128(teacher) for the system. No-one has to intervene to directly manipulateschools and teachers once this structure is up and running. It runs itself.In the same way all the knowledge about an alternative view of life,consciousness, healing and creation, are kept out of the classroomunless a rare, enlightened and determined teacher finds a way ofintroducing these subjects outside of the official curriculum. Thiscurriculum is, in the UK and doubtless elsewhere, so packed with“information” which the system insists must be taught that there is notime in the day for an alternative to its imposed reality. The educationsystem is about teaching and tuning minds to see only the world ofphysicalness or some religious “afterlife” that involves doing as youare told to avoid being handed the coal shovel.But, and here’s the point I am making in this chapter, billions ofpeople have bought the idea that passing exams set by the system forthe perpetuation of the system is a measurement of a child’s or student’ssuccess. Young people worry and sweat and have their lives blightedby the fear of not passing this or that exam and getting the grades thesystem has decided confirms your level of intelligence. Someyoungsters even commit suicide if they fail to achieve this and theyfeel incredible guilt at “letting down” their parents. My friends, if yourparents are going to feel let down or think you are a failure becauseyou have failed to recall the trash the system was asking you to recite,they deserve to be disappointed. It’ll do them good. It’s time they grewup. For goodness sake what is an “exam”? It is the system saying “tellme what I want to hear, otherwise you fail. Do as I say or you’ll be aloser, kid”. Exams are actually a measurement of how indoctrinatedyou are! Exams are a colossal irrelevance, except where they relate toa specific job or task. They don’t matter. Your personal learning, yourunderstanding of yourself and your potential, is what matters andthe education/indoctrination system suppresses, not caresses, thatunderstanding. You’re not a clone, you are an amazing being of lightand love with an astonishing uniqueness to express. What are you doingworrying about examinations set by a system which wants to conditionyou, clone you and crush your sense of uniqueness?It’s a piece a shit, walk away.Still today, despite all the evidence from past and present, peoplecontinue to argue about party politics, even though the same Elite hasfunded and manipulated virtually every major party in the world into"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"129existence. People turn out at the mass rallies waving their party flags,clapping and cheering as dictated by the spin doctors playing to thecameras, and then off trot their heroes to Downing Street, the WhiteHouse or wherever, to pursue policies that are a virtual mirror-imageof the “opponents” they replaced. What we call “democracies” aremerely One Party States with the same force, a Global Elite, eithercontrolling directly, or dictating by events, the decisions of presidentsand prime ministers who only appear to be in charge. They are not.They are puppets. Look at the background, for instance, to Bill Clintonand George Bush and you see that they are members of the sameorganisations and controlled by the same clique.1 Yet they appear to beopponents with one proclaiming to be a “Democrat” and the other a“Republican”. Again, it’s an illusion, some more special effects to dupethe audience watching the movie. We have to think we have choiceotherwise we might realise we live in a dictatorship that is only deckedout to look like freedom.In many ways I feel for politicians. They are pawns being movedaround the board by manipulation and events until they no longer knowtheir arse from their elbow. They become so focussed on the dream ofpower that they have no idea what they really think or stand for - ifanything. The pursuit of power becomes the sole decider of policy and“opinion”. It is policy by yesterday’s headlines or the latest,manipulated opinion poll - both of which are dictated by the Elite. Intruth, politicians, even presidents and prime ministers, have no realpower. They are at the mercy of events controlled by those much higherup the pyramid, those who manipulate public opinion - the very opinionthe politicians seek to pander to at election time. This means that alltheir “policies” and attitudes are basically the same (the One PartyState), and this has turned politics into a sickening farce in which insultsare preferred to insight and discord to debate. Twice a week in theHouse of Commons in London, the Prime Minister hosts somethingknown as Question Time when he or she is questioned by the leader ofthe opposition. I will give you a flavour:Opposition Leader: “Will the Prime Minister please explain why hisgovernment is the most useless, unfair administration, in the history ofthis parliament, and why he is such a jerk, incapable of running a whelkstall on Camden market?”1 See ... and the truth shall set you free."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"130(Sits down amid loud cheers from fellow party members who arewaving bits of paper and shouting silly yah boo remarks.)Prime Minister: “What hypocrisy for that to come from the mostuseless, talentless opposition party in the history of this parliament, ledby a man who is such a jerk that he couldn’t run afish and chip shop onBrighton sea front.”(Sits down amid loud cheers from his fellow party members who arewaving bits of paper and shouting silly yah boo, remarks)I don’t claim that to be verbatim, but you get my drift. Two peopletrade insults and it is seen as a virility contest for which one is bestequipped to run the country I thought the Prime Minister looked moreauthoritative and in control today you know. The way he said “You’rejust a lily-livered berk” right at the end was a master stroke of timing.He’ll win some points in the ratings for that! Often these mutual insultsare the lead story on the television news that night:(Fade loud, ominous music, and cue stern, concerned lookingnewsreader with stern, concerned sounding voice): “The Prime Ministerand the Leader of the Opposition clashed in the Commons today overwhich one was the biggest jerk. A report coming up.”ZZZzzzzzzzz!No, wake up. We’re supposed to take this seriously We are supposedto ponder long and hard over which one we will vote for as the nextpuppet of the global dictators and the manipulators on the FourthDimension. Come on, this is serious. We can’t just ignore electionsbecause we know that whoever runs for president on both “sides” isfunded, controlled and selected by the same clique who use the media,which they also control, to make sure the guy they really want wins.How can we call ourselves free if we don’t use our vote to decide whichof these guys will be the next puppet of the Elite? My pappy diedfighting for the right to vote, y’hear? You can’t ignore “free” elections.No? I beg to differ.We will only loosen the weights on our consciousness and risetowards Oneness when we let go of the irrelevant diversions that takeour eyes off the ball.

The party political system, like thefinancial system, is going to collapse because its structure is a physicalexpression of the old global energy field, the old imagination thathumanity has had of itself. To support this system any longer by votingat rigged elections (also known as democracy) is to give it an energywhich will prolong its death and the human prison it underpins. It iswasting energy which could be used to create another reality to replacethe old. Let it die, its day is gone. We are growing up now. As thespiritual transformation gathers pace and the sense of human realitychanges, the old structures of party politics and interest-bearing debtare being thought out of existence. This will manifest on the physicallevel as people losing confidence in the system, refusing to play by itsrules, and the edifice of control will be denied the power (our power)which it needs to survive. It is already sprinting to stand still, or ratherchasing its own tail. The time is approaching when it will disappear upits own backside, like some giant black hole, never to be seen again.Halleluyaaaah. How quickly that happens depends on how quickly wewithdraw our energy from it and stop taking seriously the sight of boysand girls playing silly little games while trying to look important.Politics is an illusion of freedom, it is imposition parading as choice,and it only survives because we give it our energy by playing thedummy at the one party ballot box. Those who get to the top in politicsare the least qualified people for the job because of what they need todo, and the attitudes they need to have, to reach the summit of thegreasy pole.In 1996 Bill Clinton said he supported a curfew for children andyoung people up to the age of 17. This was, he said, to reduce juvenilecrime (problem-reaction-solution). In fact it was a stepping stone tothe much wider use of the curfew (control) in the adult population.Juvenile crime is obviQusly not desirable, but it pales in the face of theviolence and crime created and perpetrated by politicians and those whocontrol them. A 16-year-old breaking into a house is deeply unpleasantfor those involved, of course. It hardly compares, however, with themurder and maiming of thousands of people by US and NATO aircraft,or the death and misery of billions in the Third World caused by abuseand manipulation by governments in the “west”. Therefore if curfewsare such an effective response to violence and crime, it is only right"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"132that we should have them for the President of the United States and hisequivalents across the planet. If they spent their days tidying theirrooms and doing their homework, the world would be a much saferplace. Amazingly, that is actually true! Party politics should carry ahealth warning: Danger, not to be taken seriouslyIt’s a piece a shit, walk away.Two other areas I would raise in this context are economics and themedia. We can get seriously hooked into sterile, diversionary, debatesabout economics and money Economists are wheeled on nightly to tellus how important some irrelevant financial development is to our livesand why this or that must happen to compensate. It usually involvesbigger taxation, holding down wages, or higher prices. We then worryabout money and attract what we fear. It is a vicious circle. We have a“can’t do” economic system which reflects the system as a whole. It’sdesigned as a prison. By “can’t do” I mean that anything that reallyneeds doing to fundamentally improve life on Earth cannot be done,according to the mind doctors, because of its effect on “economicstability” - in other words it doesn’t suit the Global Elite and theircontrollers on the Fourth Dimension. “I know what you suggest wouldhelp people,” they say “but look at the effect on inflation or the publicsector borrowing requirement”. You name it and the system will offeryou a long word to justify why it can’t be done. There is nothing wecan’t do. It is only that we choose not to do it and because the economicsystem is designed to prevent positive change. It is a prison because itis meant to be a prison. We have people in need and people who havethe skills to help them, but the rigidity of the economic (Elite-created)structure seeks to stop the two getting together. When they tell you thatsomething can’t be done because it would harm the economy, they arelying to you or betraying their own misunderstanding of what is goingon. Economic-speak seeks to confuse us and diminish us because wedon’t understand the Tanguage and what seems to be such a complexweb of figures and data. In fact, it’s dead simple. You lend peoplemoney that doesn’t exist and charge them interest on it. Everything overand above that is a smoke-screen which is built on the foundations oflending people money that doesn’t exist and charging interest on it.Without that global conjuring trick, it all comes tumbling down. Andyet when we hear predictions that this system will collapse there isenormous fear among those who are enslaved by it. I can understand"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"133that, given the way we are conditioned. But why are we desperatelytrying to shore up the walls of our own prison? Let it go, the quickerthe better, and then we can create a system of interest-free money andexchange that is based on abundance for all, and not, as today, onmanufactured scarcity which leads to dependency - control. If we thinkabundance, there will be abundance.Everything is made from energy and energy is infinite. There is noshortage of anything. Scarcity only comes when we accept theconditioning that life is about struggle, scarcity, and mere survival.Again, if that is our imagination of ourselves and the world, there willbe scarcity but we can just as easily create abundance. There is nothingto fear about the imminent collapse of the global financial prison.There’s no need to waste your energy and emotions worrying aboutthe consequences. You will always have whatever you need if that isyour imagination of yourself. And there’s no need to divert yourattention from your multidimensional self by getting caught up ineconomic “debate” and argument about the best way to resuscitate adinosaur. Trying to stop the collapse of this economic insanity wouldbe like rearranging the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic. A waste of timeand energy. Much more sensible to climb in a lifeboat. This is yoursinking prison we are talking about and it’s falling apart. Why aren’twe rejoicing instead of searching for the glue? The economic structureis going to fall anyway because the energy field or “matrix” whichcreated the structure is imploding with changing human consciousnessand the energies now encircling this dimension. The economic systemwhich we see as our security is really a ball and chain. Let it go. Thinkit out of existence.It’s a piece a shit, walk away.I guess nothing powers the light at the bottom of the bottle more thanthe global media. I worked in newspapers, radio and television formany years and I can honestly say that in all that time I never had asingle conversation with a fellow journalist that was not related to theversion of life promoted by the Hassle-Free Zone. I cannot recall thosedaily conversations producing one original thought. There are few moreprogrammed, conditioned professions than the media. And yet it is thismyopic mentality which writes and edits the “news” that you read andhear every day! You don’t have to control every journalist personallyto force them to publish the Elite version of “truth”. It’s much easier"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134than that. You create the mentality and perspective from which themedia sees the world and from that point the manipulation virtuallyruns itself. For instance, the media judges everything from theperspective of the status quo, the “norm” accepted as reality within theHassle-Free Zone. Whoever decides what that “norm” shall be at anypoint, effectively decides how the media will report the world. Thestatus quo - the accepted norm - a few centuries ago was that the Earthwas flat. Today’s media, in line with the “scientific” and religious statusquo at that time, would have ridiculed or condemned anyone who daredto suggest it was round. But once the evidence became sooverwhelming that the status quo reality had to change, suddenly it wasthose who said the Earth was flat who were laughed at. So it is withthe modern media and this is why anyone who challenges thefundamentals of the accepted “norm” is immediately jumped upon bythe media monster. In effect, the media is the police force of the Hassle-Free Zone. It frightens people into conforming to imposed norms.Meeting so many mainstream journalists and seeing their attitudes tolife has served to confirm this to me more times than I care to recall.That is not to condemn them as people. They, like all of us, areincredible beings of light in their multidimensional form. But, in myview, they have switched off their multidimensional self and chosen towork on a fraction of their potential to understand and “see”. Thismakes them a manipulator’s dream and the ideal mentality for ajournalist within a system designed to control and misinform.The media is part of the game and reports the players in the gamewithout ever questioning the game itself. The “big name correspondentsand news presenters are nothing more than sports reporters. They reporta different game, that’s all. They report on the ups and downs of teamsin the game, the political parties, the banks and the financial exchanges,and they interview the managers,’ the players and the pundits. Theycall this “reporting” or “investigative journalism”, but it only“investigates” those areas which will not expose the game itself as thereason for our global plight. They never question the game because themedia is part of the game and owned by the game. It is fundamental tothe game. Any journalist who sought to really expose the game as rottento the core or, God forbid, that it is controlled by a relative handful ofpeople, none of which are ever elected, would be looking for anotherjob. If anyone tried to explain that we create our own reality and thatwe live in a virtual reality vortex, they would be clearing their deskwith a recommendation that they see a shrink. The mental and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"135emotional divide between the view of life expressed in this book andthe media mentality is not only a chasm, it’s a universe. The media isanother example of oppo-sames promoted as choice and diversity. Theonly real difference between the so called “radical”, “intellectual”London Guardian and the tits and bums London tabloid called The Sunis the size of the paper, the length of the stories, and the approach theyuse to defend the status quo. Oh yes, the Guardian and its like aroundthe world will pontificate about poverty and freedom and criticiseplayers and teams in the game. But on the foundations that shore upthe game it is at one with The Sun. They are status quo protectionsheets.The same goes for the BBC, an organisation I used to work for. Itsticks its nose in the air and talks of pursuing truth, but it is really justanother arm of the Global Elite’s propaganda network. In December1995, the BBC produced a “Review of the Year” in which the“reporter” proceeded to tell the story of the year according to theofficial version of events. One section talked of the “enemy within”and opportioned blame for the Oklahoma bombing and the Japanunderground gas attack to groups and individuals who had yet to evenstand trial! They simply took the government line of what hadhappened and who was to blame. No other view was reported. When Iwrote to the Director General of the BBC asking how this could bejustified, there was no denial of the points I made, only that the wholestory could not be told due to pressure of time. That was a nonsensebecause in the time they gave to these items a balanced picture couldhave been reported. But here we had the BBC, this so called legendarybroadcasting network, unable to deny that they gave only one versionof events - the official one. The same is happening in newspapers andon radio and television stafl 0 us the world over every day with all thetelevision networks like NBC, CBS and ABC in the United Statesowned by the Global Elite, as is the global cable news network, CNN.It is called news, but it is propaganda, designed at source to manipulatethe mass consciousness. Only a comparatively few journalistsknowingly manipulate. Most of those who report this propaganda areduped into thinking it is news and truth.

Listening to all views,including those of the New Age “teachers”, is a good thing if we filtertheir information and take from it what we believe is right while leavingthe rest. The danger comes when people take everything that someonesays and, in effect, take on another’s belief system in full. I have foundquite an arrogance among some in the New Age who insist that whatthey say must be accepted by all of us. There is even a New Age fashionwhich is nothing more than the uniform you find within other areas ofthe system. For me, the New Age has become bogged down withirrelevant ceremony, jargon, and bullshit masquerading asenlightenment. People give their power away to Ashtar Commands andMaitreyas and a stream of other “masters”, so ignoring the real masterwithin. This is an example of how the pendulum or the scales swingfrom one extreme to the other before settling down to balance. I feelalso that the same Fourth Dimensional manipulators who created thereligions, party politics and the global financial system, aremanipulating parts of the New Age and it is a warning of how the sameold hierarchical structures can be dressed up as new. I have greatsympathy with the view that the New Age movement is planned toevolve into the World Religion, another global centralisation andimposition on the Elite’s agenda. There is a consciousness that hasmoved beyond the New Age which has accepted the themes ofreincarnation and the eternal, multidimensional nature ofconsciousness, but has rejected the complicated explanations and theNew Age-speak. It has seen the simplicity of everything and realisesthat much of the New Age is’ another diversion from that simplicity. Ifeel we need to be constantly selective and allow our own intuition tomake that selection. There is a great deal in the New Age which ishighly commendable and makes an important contribution to theawakening of the human heart and mind. But there is even more inNew Age dogma to which the following would be highly applicable:It’s a piece a shit, walk away.When I use the term “walk away”, I don’t mean that we should neverpamper our bodies, observe the political scene, go to a school, listen tothe view of New Age “teachers”, or use the financial system as it stands"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138today I would not dream of telling you what to do, that’s up to you andno-one else.

Self love is thatbalance point when we allow ourselves the freedom from fear and guiltto be who and what we are. In turn, true love for others is to allowthem, without resentment and judgement, to be who they are, even if itdiffers from what we would like them to be. I love you because youare. I love me because I am. Now that’s love.When I look back at my life I can see so clearly how my journeytowards self love has been mirrored in my physical experience. For thefirst 42 years I didn’t think much of myself at all. I was the classicangry man, my temper always simmering just below the surface as myfrustrations at the world I saw around me bubbled like some steamingcauldron in my psyche. I didn’t like me and I didn’t like the world.Planet Earth was a shitty place, populated by too many shitty people.This was a replica of how I saw myself. I lived life on an emotionalknife edge, wishing to love, but so often feeling only anger and “pity”which I believed, quite wrongly to be an expression of love. Thatattracted into my life many people who mirrored back at me what wasgoing on inside. My life was a stream of angry confrontations withpeople, born of my own inner anger. I wasn’t angry with them, in truth,I was angry with myself and they were the means through which I couldexpress that anger outwardly instead of dealing with the source withinme. After my spiritual alarm clock went off at the start of the 1990s, Ibegan, slowly at first and then at great speed, to see myself in a verydifferent light. For the first time in this incarnation, I started to likemyself. Crikey, call the police. That’s a crime, isn’t it? It’s not a case oflooking in the mirror, brushing the eyebrows, and saying “Oooh, I’m abit of alright”, although there’s nothing wrong with that, either.

I began to see that whatever I was doingat any time, whatever I was experiencing or helping others toexperience, was what I needed to do at that moment to face myself,help others face themselves, and so gain greater insight andunderstanding. When my sense of self changed, the people I attractedinto my life changed also. The angry confrontations with others(myself) began to subside and along came people who loved me forwhat I am, not for what they wish me to be. I stopped trying to be whatI thought others wanted me to be - the mask - and I have found peacewith what I am, a unique aspect of God making a unique contributionto the human tapestry of experience. I have changed my sense of innerreality and therefore I have changed my physical reality. I have startedto love myself and that is mirrored by others back to me in return.What’s more, as I have loved myself unconditionally, I have found iteasier to love others without condition. One person in particular haschallenged me in this area of unconditional love and, as a result, helpedme to travel further along that road.

When you look back through known human historyit is a story of people (inspired from the Fourth Dimension I wouldsay) using fear and violence to impose their version of life on themasses. Religion played the major role in this to the point where non-believers were burned. The impact on the evolving psyche of thisconstant pressure to conform and do as it was told - or else - hasconditioned humanity over scores of Earth-lives to submit to aperceived “authority”. Today, the human race is so easy to herd intothe pen because it has been in the pen before; life after life. It is notjust one lifetime of conditioning that we are addressing here - it isthousands of years of them. When I talk of letting go conditionedresponses, I am talking about attitudes and fears ingrained over vastperiods of what we call time. The intense fear of expressing ouruniqueness is not the result of only this life experience. It results fromthe sum total of our human experience, including those times when tosay what you really believed was tantamount to a death sentence, asindeed it still is for many people. When we have intense fears andphobias that have no “rational” explanation, it is events in this life,often quite innocuous events on the face of it, trigg&ring memories ofdeep emotional trauma caused by a past life experience. We need to bekind to ourselves. It’s been a tough journey through this dense physicalworld, but now we have a golden chance to complete it.Also, the misunderstandings and manipulation of the threedimensional world have turned experience, without which we couldnot evolve, into a nightmare of resentment, guilt and recrimination.

Their status quo, theirfalse sense of personal security, is being challenged by businesscollapse, loss of employment, the break up of long term relationships,and so on. If we have a false sense of programmed security, that willcome under challenge from events that we, repeat we, are attractingto us. On the face of it, from the physical perspective, these seem tobe very negative events and I can understand that. But we are notphysical bodies at our core, we are timeless, eternal, evolvingconsciousness and these experiences and challenges are designed tohelp us reach the vibrational state that can make the jump fromphysical prison to spiritual freedom.If we don’t see our experiences in this light, the release of suchlongtime, big time, emotional trauma could turn the world into aswirling sea of turmoil and conflict in the transition period that hasbeen winding itself up for many years and is now entering its criticalstage. It doesn’t have to be like that if we take a step back and viewour emotions and our interaction with others from a much widerperspective. Using the movie example again, we need to get off thescreen more often and into the audience. I’ll explain what I mean. Thebuild up of emotional baggage through each Earth-life experience intowhat is by now an explosive mass of negativity, is the result of believingthat this world is real. It is not. It is a three-dimensional, virtual reality,holographic, movie screen designed to provide us with the opportunityto experience the separation of Oneness as an aid to our furtherexploration of ourselves. We have also been under the illusion that weare separate. We are not. We are all aspects of One consciousness, God,experiencing itself subjectively through its constituent parts - all of us.In truth, one actor is playing all the parts and sometimes this actor kicksthe crap out of itself.

This separationhas manifested in the separation of humanity into differentrelationships, groups, beliefs and lifestyles, each seeking to imposetheir version of right and wrong on everyone. Once you stop respectingyour own right to be you, whatever you may be, and you stop respectingeveryone’s right to be them, the circumstances are there for emotionalwarfare to unfold on the personal and collective level. You have inneremotional turmoil because you are suppressing who you really are andsubmitting, through fear, to another’s design; and/or you are seethingwith anger and resentment with people who won’t live their lives asyou believe they should.There are two main types of people, it seems to me. Those in themovie and those in the audience. The most effective approach, I wouldsuggest, is to keep switching between the two. Then you enjoy bothperspectives. Those stuck entirely in the movie (the overwhelmingmajority) believe that the movie is real. Learning experiences becomeenormous emotional catastrophes and the guilt and resentment thisproduces is held throughout that lifetime and into the next one. Far fromremoving baggage and moving on, each Earth4ife simply collects more.Those stuck entirely in the audience (the few) realise that this is avirtual reality game, but they withdraw themselves so far from theintensity of physical experience that they don’t “feel” the emotions thatlead to such a greater understanding of self and Creation. They copout, you might say. There is a balance point here. It is to feel theemotion of physical, separated interaction in the moment it occurs andto react in whatever way seems right, but then to detach from that close-in view (the movie) and observe why it happened from the widerperspective (the audience). From this more detached view, you canrefocus on the understanding that you created the experience, whateverit was, because of something going on within you, or something fromwhich you were hoping to learn. It is so important to detach emotionallyfrom the movie, but not so far that we lose the true power of theexperiences it offers. I always find it more effective to scream“Aaaaaahhhh, bollocks to it” when I hit my thumb with a hammer thanto quietly whisper “Oh what a wonderful learning experienceBut once I have hurled abuse at the hammer, I realise that while thehammer was the apparent cause of my pain, it was in my hand at thetime.

It’s incredible what makes us feelguilty. I have met people in their fifties and sixties who are still screwedup with the guilt of “failing” to achieve in their lives what their fathersor mothers wanted them to achieve. I remember when my own soccercareer ended with arthritis, how I felt worse about the effect this wouldhave on my father than I did for the loss of my own dreams. I feltguilty about getting an illness that ended the career I had dreamed aboutsince childhood because of the pain it caused my father. My own painwas far less important to me. Mind, I spent most of my life feelingguilty about everything and anything. I could have represented Englandat feeling guilty. This creates a vicious cycle of interreaction. Iremember that my own cycle, or rather downward spiral, was gettingangry, feeling guilty about getting angry, and getting frustrated at theway I felt about myself as the guilt destroyed my self respect. Thisstimulated further anger, which made me feel even more guilty... onand on it went year after year. How could I be me? I didn’t know who“me” was. “Me” was submerged and drowning in a sea of anger, guiltand plummeting self worth. As I look back it is clear that I hatedmyself, to be honest. There was this David Icke chap, the televisionlinkman appearing on the screen smiling, confident and chummy. Andyet behind those eyes and within that heart sat a little boy, lost andimprisoned by the turmoil of anger, guilt and self-disdain that swampedthe love at the core of my being, the love that is me. How can we loveourselves and therefore love others unconditionally, cosmically, in theface of that deluge of inner negative emotion? It is this emotion whichis reacting and interreacting with itself in what we call “life”, the worldwe see around us at home and on the television news. Life on PlanetEarth has become the interaction between programmed, emotionaleggshells. The real us, love, hardly gets a look in. It is often just ahorrified spectator. True love rarely has the chance to communicate itswisdom, balance, and harmony and the world reflects precisely thatsituation.The people we meet are mirrors of ourselves or actors playing a rolewhich can teach us something about ourselves and the world. We attractthem to us because they mirror the vibes we are broadcasting fromwithin or because their states of being create an experience which canlead to greater understanding.

When we get angry with others, we are getting angrywith ourselves. It’s interesting how often you hear the comment: “It’salright for so and so to do that, but when anyone else does the same he/she goes crazy”. This response comes when we see a characteristic ofourselves which we don’t like, expressed by someone else. We oftenreact to that person in a really over-the-top way because they aremirroring at us something we don’t wish to face about ourselves ortheir behaviour has pushed emotional buttons deep within us thattrigger memories of past life experiences or those from this life,especially from the emotional minefield we call childhood. I have seenpeople become vicious and violent when this happens to them. Thefocus of their anger is not the person involved, they are just the mirror.It is themselves they are attacking. But most people don’t realise that -they are stuck in the movie and the separation and they think it is real.But now look at guilt from the more detached view - the front row ofthe stalls. When we act negatively towards another person, that is areflection of our own sense of self, our own imagination of ourselves,at that moment. OK, if we are sensible, we learn from the consequencesof what we did, evolve, and move on. That’s a positive experience forwhich we should be thankful. It has given us understanding. But, fromthe wider perspective, the person on the receiving end of that behaviourshould be grateful too, once they have felt the initial emotional hurt.We create our own reality by attracting to us magnetically the energyfields, people, experiences, which match the imagination of ourselvesthat we are broadcasting. Our behaviour is a reflection of our state ofbeing and that also applies to the experience of our “victim”. Theyattracted our state of being to them at that moment, and not anotherperson who would have reacted very differently, because they neededto face what our state of being could give them. Instead of feeling guiltyabout what we have or have not done to others, we need to learn fromthe experience, know that it was a gift, a learning experience forourselves and for the other person or people. They created it just asmuch as we did. Experience is how we evolve and we need the fullrange of possible experiences for a balanced evolution. If we are goingto hold on to guilt with every negative experience we have attracted,we are going to be swamped with the stuff. And we have been. Look atus. Let us see guilt for what it really is - the unjustified emotional handluggage that slows down our journey to Oneness because it destroysour sense of self. Guilt is merely the negative side of experience. It is"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"151valid in that it is an emotion we can feel and learn from. But it is notmeant to be in permanent residence, squatting in our psyche. Let it go.Let the weights fall off. It’s time to fly. There is nothing to feel guiltyabout. No, not ever. A big movie star doesn’t feel guilty when he playsout the part of the “baddie” does he? Of course not. Then why do you?You’re a bigger star in a bigger movie. If you don’t like the part, changethe script.The same applies to resentment. Just as we hold on to guilt for whatwe have done to others, so we seethe with resentment, consciously andsubconsciously, for what others have done to us. We seek revenge,sometimes conspiring to bring that about, most often just wishing illsand “come-uppance” for those who dare to give us an experience thataids our evolution. How dare they help me to evolve? I am so angry. Ifthe focus of our resentment does face a karmic reaction for theirbehaviour, the temptation is to laugh and feel that sense of satisfactioninside that says “they got what was coming to them”. We can hold onto resentment from childhood for an entire lifetime. And who suffersfor that? Certainly not the people we are resentful about. They mightbe having a great time while we suffer and seethe to an early gravethrough cancer, heart attacks, and other physical expressions ofsuppressed anger and resentment. Not very clever is it, really?Resentment has multilevel consequences. It can mean that children andparents don’t talk to each other for years, that neighbours ignore eachother in the street, or that resentment passed on and indoctrinated fromparent to child perpetuates violence between communities for hundredsor even thousands of years. There is nothing more destructive that aparent can do than to bring up a child to resent other people or beliefs,because in that way the imbalances of the parents are visited on thechildren which are, in turn, collectively visited upon the community.Look at Northern Ireland, the Balkans, the Middle East, and other longterm intergenerational trouble spots around the world. When the parentsgrow up to the extent that they cease to see divisions of race, colour,creed, religion or income bracket, the cycle of violence will end becausethe children will inherit that balanced view of life. If you no longerwish to live amid violence and fear generation after generation, or youno longer want the anger and resentment to continue with your parents,neighbours, children, or friends, the answer is within you.

If you no longer projectbitterness the conflict must end because love and bitterness are neverin conflict. They cannot be because love is without judgment,bitterness, guilt or resentment - the very fires that make conflictpossible.It is the same with fear. It is our creation. Ask a group of people whatmost frightens them and you will get a stream of different answers. Itmay be boats, planes, small spaces, big spaces, spiders, snakes,speaking in public. The list is as long as human experience. Whatterrifies one person will have no effect on the other. Why? Becausefear, what we fear, whether we fear, is our individual choice, ourcreation. It often has a past life origin and it is always an expression ofsomething within us that needs dealing with. This is why we attract tous what we most fear because we need to face those terrors and workthrough them, otherwise our evolution in the area of our lives relatedto the fear will come to a dead stop. Fear is like a cruise missile to ourself esteem. It explodes it apart. We are embarrassed at being frightenedof something and as that leads to low self esteem and frustration, itcreates an emotional cocktail that often affects our whole lives. Fearcan also become so panicked that it thrashes out first in violentconfrontation, like some cornered rat. I seem to have been frightenedof everything as a child. I made room for the fear between all the guilt,you know. I should have organised a rota: 9.00am to 9.30am - feelguilty for not being what my father wants me to be; 9.30am to 10.30am- be terrified by the thought of the lesson with that horrible scienceteacher; 10.30am to 12.30pm - feel guilty for how I treated my matethree years earlier; 12.30pm to 1.30pm - lunch; you think I’m kidding?I was like an emotional road traffic accident. I could have feared forEngland, too.I guess the four biggest fears in my life were going to the dentist,flying, being ridiculed and speaking in public. My worst nightmarewould have been having a tooth out on a plane while making a speechto the laughing passengers. But I am the living proof that fear is ourown individual creation. I don’t fear any of those things now. In fact Idon’t fear anything on a scale that limits my actions and certainlynothing that is long term. Those fears, like all fears, were an expressionof my sense of self.

What we fear and how we fear is notsome random accident, it reflects what is going on inside. I let go ofthe fear of pain after years of agony from the arthritis, a condition thatdramatically improved as I began to ditch all this emotional baggage.My fear of death disappeared (and so of flying) when I realised thatthere is no death. My fear of having my destiny in the hands of anotherdispersed when I knew that our destiny is never in the hands of anyone,but ourselves. It is our imagination of ourselves, our personal vibe, thatdecides if we are attracted to a plane that is going to crash or whetherwe are attracted to andther flight that will get there safely. There are noaccidents, only human creations within the universal law of what wethink is what we create. My fear of ridicule was dealt with when I wasa national figure of fun in the United Kingdom after going public withthe story of what was an extraordinary and explosive spiritualawakening for me in the early 1990s. And my fear of speaking in publicdisappeared when I looked to myself for confirmation that I am an OKperson and not to an audience of people outside of myself. That is whyso many people are frightened of speaking in public. They are lookingfor their self esteem outside of themselves in the reactions of otherpeople to what they say and do, instead of saying: I am what I am and Ihave a right to be what I am and express what I am. I am me, I am free.When you do that, you respect the audiences’ right to be them, and totake whatever you say as they see fit. But you are not nervous,frightened or intimidated, no matter how big the attendance may be oreven how hostile they may be to what you are saying. You know whoyou are, you have a right to be what you are, and to express that. Whenyou get your power and self esteem from within, you don’t need theaudience to massage your sense of self. With that, the fear of expressingyourself publicly is gone. Experiencing these fears and eliminatingthem has given me so many gifts of understanding.These are not navel contemplating issues we are talking about here.This is not some peripheral add-on or marginal subject we areaddressing which can be put aside until the more important problemsof the “real world” are sorted out.

We can see the people who pressour buttons and release our emotional sewage for what they really areteachers bearing the gifts of self understanding which will release usfrom the emotional prisons which have blighted human existence forso ldng. Putting it another way, we can love our “enemies” and “forgivethose who trespass against us”. This way we release the emotionstriggered by such experiences without adding yet further resentment tothe sewer by resenting those who provide the experiences. We can alsosee ourselves as teachers as we, too, act as triggers for the emotionalrelease of others. Again, we help them to cleanse their emotionalburdens without adding to our own by feeling guilty at what we do tothem. We can deal with fear in a positive way by welcoming theopportunity to face our fears in the knowledge that we are fantasticbeings of light to which nothing is impossible. There is nothing to fear.We live forever, whatever. Love is the energy that will smooth thetransition more than any other. Love is the transition. There is no greatergift that we can give ourselves, our fellow men and women and theEarth, than love. The planet is feeling unloved because the planet hasbeen unloved. It is the same with humanity.

And so it is. Sexis not a quick bonk.. .wham, bam, thank you ma’am. Nor is it sordid,dirty, and something to feel guilty about. In its highest expression, it isan ultimate spiritual experience between two people in the densephysical world. It is a means through which we can connect with thehighest levels of ourselves and access our fantastic creative power. Wehave been diverted from doing this by another group of oppo-samesreligion, the tabloid media, and the pornography industry. Religion, thetabloid papers, and pornography on the same side? Yes, in their effect,certainly.To understand why, we need to look at the nature of physicalexperience and the genetic spacesuit we call the body. What you see isonly the physical level of ourselves, that face and body that stares backfrom the mirror. On levels unseen by the physical senses is our eternalconsciousness, the aura, as some people call it (Figure 9 overleaf). Theaura 15 the amalgamation of the energy fields which together make upthe thinking, feeling, emotional us. Or at least that part of the eternal“I” which is working directly through the body. One of these levels,the etheric, is the intelligence which organises the replacement of cells,controls the electrical system of the body, and generally governs thebody’s activities. When the etheric energy field is imbalanced, as it isthrough emotional disharmony, the emotional dis-ease becomesphysical dis-ease.

The cause of cancer is etheric disruption,usually stimulated by emotional disruption, although contact withelectromagnetic energy fields, like power lines and electricalequipment, can also trigger cancerous cell replacement because theelectromagnetism destabilises the magnetic balance of the ethericenergy field.

Dyingof a broken heart is to be so emotionally traumatised that the etheric isthrown out of balance and the body reflects that in a terminal illness orheart failure. We literally die from emotional hurt and during the writingof this book I felt emotional pain that gave me an insight into how thisis possible.The means through which our balances and imbalances aretransferred through the levels of being is the chakra system. “Chakra”is an ancient Sanskrit word meaning wheel of light. The chakras arevortexes of energy which intersect our levels of self, and therefore animbalance in the emotional energy field will be passed through thechakras to the mental level (we stop thinking straight), and via theetheric to the physical (we become dis-eased). We have many of thesechakra vortexes, large and small, but there are seven main ones in thebody, and others outside the body which connect us with the higherrealms of our consciousness. Each vibrates to the frequency of aparticular colour and sound. The seven main body chakras arepositioned at the bottom of the spine through to the pubic bone (baseor root chakra); just below the navel (sacral or splenic chakra); betweenthe navel and the chest (solar plexus chakra); the centre of the chest(heart chakra); the throat (throat chakra); the centre of the forehead(third eye chakra); and the top of the head (crown chakra) (Figure 10overleaf). I also believe there are major chakras in the feet whichconnect and “ground” us with the Earth. Each of these chakra vortexescentres represents one level of being. The lower three chakras are ofthe Earth, the top three are of the spirit, and the heart is the centre ofbalance between them. The root chakra (red) roots us into the physicaland through the genitals creates physical life. The second chakra(orange) is closely related to the root chakra. It is our sexuality centreand has a powerful connection to the etheric body. The solar plexuschakra (yellow) is the seat of our emotions, hence we feel our emotionsin that area of the abdomen. The heart chakra (green) is from where weexpress the energy called love and this is how the ancient connectionbetween the heart and love originates. Today, in our obsession with thephysical, this link is made to the physical heart, but its origin comesfrom knowledge of the spiritual heart, the heart chakra. The throatchakra (blue) governs our ability to communicate and expressourselves. The Third Eye chakra (indigo) on the forehead is the centrefor our psychic senses, the ability to see, perceive, and access"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"160information from beyond the physical. The Crown chakra (violet) isour connection with the chakras outside of our body - the rest of thecosmos.The “halos” depicted around the head of “Jesus” and other figuresportrayed in religious art are in fact the light energy emitting from thecrown chakra. As you become more psychically sensitive, you can seethis light around the heads of people. It is the same, too, with the ideaof angels with wings. The “wings” are energy pouring out of the crownchakra like a fountain. I have seen this in some people during aheightened sense of awareness and it can look like two white wings.They are not physical wings, they are energy wings which can lift us tothe stars. The chakras transmit their state of being directly to thephysical through the glands of the endocrine system. The control centreFigure 10: the Chakra system"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"161for this system is the pineal gland in the centre of the brain, whichconnects with the “third eye” chakra, our psychic sight. The pineal isalso closely connected with the physical eyes and it is true that indeed“the eyes are the window on the soul”. When we look into someone’seyes we are looking deep into their multidimensional consciousnessvia the eyes-pineal gland-third eye-cosmos connection. You can tell somuch about a person by looking into their eyes. The pineal and theother glands of the endocrine system release hormones into the bodyin response to the changing state of the chakras and these hormonesaffect the body in positive and negative ways. It is at this point thatmainstream medical science enters the scene, with the release of thehormones and their effect on the body. They have closed their minds towhat happens before that, the instructions transmitted from the chakrasto the glands, because to recognise the existence of the chakras wouldlead to the acknowledgement of the multidimensional levels of beingand their effect on the physical body In other words, the whole basison which medical science operates (drugs and scalpels) would tumbleand so would the profits of the multinational drug companies whichcontrol the “medical” system. It is self interest which has created thedisinterest in seeing the human being as far more than a physical bodyAppreciating the existence of the chakra system is vital tounderstanding the real significance of sex. The root chakra at the baseof the spine draws in energy from the Earth known as the kundalini,another Sanskrit word meaning serpent or sleeping snake. ThroughoutEastern, and indeed many other religions, you will see the serpent usedto symbolise the kundalini energy. Look at the story of Adam and Eveas just one example and how funny that the symbol of the modernmedical profession is an ancient serpent representation of the kundalini- an energy that profession does not even acknowledge to exist! Thekundalini is part of the lifeforce and it provides the sexual energy thattriggers our creative potential. The energy people use to create aninspired painting, book, speech or piece of pottery is the same energythat stimulates sexual activity and explodes into orgasm. It is thecreative force, the same creative force that creates new life. As a friendof mine says: we are walking, talking, sex bombs! This is why theSatanic sexual rituals involving the terrorising of adults and childrenare constantly performed by the All Seeing Eye and its Global Elite -to access and trigger the creative force in its most negative form.If the creative energy is suppressed, by the suppression of sexualfeelings and natural talent, its power becomes imbalanced. This will"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"162manifest in other ways - through violence, rape, crime, wars anddepression. More spiritual sex less global violence! Also, when peopleare allowed and encouraged to express their own unique creativity, thekundalini flows in harmony, and the cQnflict, within and without,subsides. Dumping people in mind-numbing factories and office blockscreates the seeds for inner frustration, and so outward disharmony andconflict because the creative energy is being denied and suppressed.Appropriately, the word “evil” is the word “live” in reverse! But whenthe suppression of the creative energy leads to crime, violence anddisharmony, what is society’s response? To impose stricter laws andmore restriction, so further suppressing the creative force and leadingto more crime, violence and disharmony. When the creative force issuppressed it becomes destructive. That certainly applies to sex.Through our childhood, the kundalini trickles up the central channel(the spiritual spinal column) triggering and activating the other chakasat a relatively low level. This is why most children are not stirredsexually until adolescence. It is also how their true potential to think andcreate is suppressed until their bodies are capable of manifesting whattheir minds know are possible, a point I made earlier about why theconsciousness of a child does not express its real self until many yearsinto a physical life. An adult mind in a baby’s body would produceunbearable frustration. Around the time we call puberty, however, thekundalini begins to unfurl from the root chakra in much greaterquantities. It activates the genital areas and we begin to acknowledgeour sexuality. We start to see boys and girls in a rather different light. Itis the evolution from “come and play with my train set” to “Cor, I don’thalf fancy her”. As we know, puberty triggers massive hormonal changesand this is the kundalini stimulating the chakras, which then cause theglands of the endocrine system to release the hormones.The unwinding of the kundalini affects us far more than just sexually.It resonates to the colour red and is symbolised as fire. This is veryappropriate because as it flows through all the chakras it sets themablaze vibrationally. When the kundalini is flowing smoothly andpowerfully, we become more sensitive, and our minds become morealert, inquiring and open. The kundalini stimulates our memory andour ability to retain information. Our creative potential soars. Apowerful kundalini gives us a strong magnetic connection with theEarth and as it shoots out through the crown chakra at the top of thehead it connects us with our other chakras at the higher levels of ourbeing.

That’swhat human beings are supposed to be, the balance of the physical andspiritual. Instead, we are dominated by one or the other, usually thephysical, or we are out of sync with both of them.What happens for most people is that the kundalini does nottransform them in a smooth and balanced way. In fact it can be anightmare. We are back to the manipulation of this world from thenegative elements of the Fourth Dimension where the effects of theawakening kundalini are well understood. If you want to turn the humanrace into prisoners of this three dimensional reality it is essential tostem, or massively imbalance, the flow of kundalini. You disconnectthem from both a powerful link with the Earth and the higher realms ofspirit and themselves. To rise through the chakras and connect us withour higher levels of spirit, the kundalini must pass through the sacralchakra, the centre of our sexuality, and the solar plexus chakra, thecentre of our emotions. These can be such a mass of denial, fear andnegative emotion, that they act as a vibratory dam, turning the kundaliniback on itself and creating a lifetime of turmoil in that lower abdomenarea which often results in physical dis-ease. These “dams” also preventa powerful flow of kundalini from activating the potential of the higherchakras, the heart, throat, third eye and crown, so making impossible atrue connection with the higher spiritual dimensions of ourselves. Weoperate on the level of the spaceman in the spacesuit delinked fromMission Control and we become a manipulator’s puppet. People in thisstate (the vast, vast majority) are neither of the Earth or of the spirit.They are of the limbo land somewhere between them. One means bywhich this is achieved brings us back to sex.The same fourth dimensional force which created and used religion,particularly Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, to destroy the truth aboutsex, also inspired the culture of pornography and the quick “bonk”.The common theme between these oppo-sames is closing down the rootchakra, imbalancing the sacral and emotional chakras, and stemmingthe flow of kundalini, which if left alone would activate and connectall levels of being into wholeness. Religion has turned sex into a focusfor an explosion of guilt of atomic proportions. The institution ofmarriage is at the heart of this, but it is not the only reason by anymeans. Marriage institutionalises separation. He’s mine, she’s mine. Imarry you, therefore I own you. This is the spoken or unspoken realityof marriage and relationships in general.

They buy the fairy stories about wedding daysand happy every afters. Most marriage is not about love, but possessionand control. Only a tiny few marriages are fulfilling the partners. Theymay not realise why they feel empty and unfulfilled, but it’s becausetheir real potential to expand and create is being suppressed by thisinstitutionalised prison. The consequences of walking away are toomuch for most people to contemplate and that is the only reason whythe divorce rate, already rising rapidly, is not a tidal wave. Soon it willbe.I am not suggesting that it is not right to live with someone for whomyou have great affection, even love, or that there shouldn’t be somepublicly spoken commitment to each other, if that’s what the coupledesire. I am saying that to institutionalise that commitment, to bringthe church and state into it, and to create penalties for withdrawing at alater stage, is utterly ridiculous. How can you turn a human relationshipinto something regulated by the state? How can someone be expectedto commit themselves at the age of 20 or 25 to another person for therest of their lives? Who knows what lies ahead or how the two willchange in their attitude to life and each other? The whole idea is crazy.Yet for thousands of years that is the mockery of love and relationshipswhich religion has visited upon the human race. It is considered betterto suffer your pain and stay in a marriage than to say you have grownapart and it’s time to move on. In countries under the fiercest religiousdomination, like Ireland, it has been against the law to end a marriage!And yet Ireland has still called itself a free country. I don’t remembereven Josef Stalin suggesting that marriage could never be ended. Areferendum in 1995 voted by a very small majority to repeal that lawin Ireland, but still people battle to retain the right of church and stateto dictate to the population who they will and will not have an officialrelationship with. According to this mental state, it is better to continuea marriage which both partners hate, than to bring it to a naturalconclusion and free the partners to find love elsewhere. It also createsthe unbelievable situation in which children at the moment of birth aredubbed “illegitimate” because their parents are not officially connectedby a piece of headed notepaper. There is no such thing as illegitimatelife. It doesn’t exist except in the padlocked human mind. I wouldsuggest that anyone who sees life in terms of legitimate and illegitimate,is in need of some serious help.

Surely love should be the bond which holds two peoplein a relationship, not a piece of paper and a sense of duty. Mostmarriage is not based on love. Its reason for being is companionship,financial security, habit, social conformity and fear of the alternative.What a basis on which to live your life with someone. Perhaps the mostdestructive element of the marriage game is that it institutionalises andmakes a part of the law of the land the belief that you can only loveone person at a time, preferably for life. It makes official the law ofseparation and denies the law of Oneness.This has fundamental effects on the flow of the kundalini. Sometimesyou need to interact sexually with more than one person in your life,even after marriage, because different people affect you in differentways. One person’s consciousness - energy fields - will activate yoursin a slightly, sometimes dramatically, different way to another. Thekundalini is not just one blob of energy, it has many different elementswhich need to be stimulated and awakened if we are going to enjoyour true and infinite creative potential. It is not only sexual activitywhich opens the kundalini, but it is one very powerful and rapid wayto trigger the serpent transformation. I had a very close relationshipwith my wife, Linda, after we met and married within a few weeks in1971. I was 19 and she was 21. She is an amazing woman and I don’tregret one second of the years I spent with her. The fact that I marriedher is irrelevant. Getting married was something people were supposedto do when they loved each other, so we did. The bond which heldbetween us through some experiences that would have shattered mostrelationships into a thousand pieces is not marriage, it is love. You onlyknow the true strength of a relationship when the bond is challengedby events. So many “ideal” relationships fall at that point because theyare built on conditional love and self delusion. The biggest challengeto my bond with Linda came in 1991 when I had a sexual relationshipwith another woman amid front page headlines. I had no idea at thetime why I did that or why it happened. My life in the weeks beforeand after was lived in some dream-state. I didn’t know where I was orwhat was happening to me. I reacted in the way we are programmed toreact in such situations. I was consumed by guilt and remorse somassive I thought it would destroy me. It took me years to work itthrough and cope with the assault on my self-esteem and the self-lovewhich I found so hard to feel. But I see things differently now.From the perspective of the kundalini, that situation can be viewedfrom a much higher level of understanding, the stalls, not the movie."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"166Within two weeks of that sexual relationship starting my wholeconsciousness had erupted into a new sense of self and reality. Everyfibre of my being was going through a transformation which openedmy mind and my eyes to so much. As I was staggering, physically,emotionally and mentally, to cope with a mass of new knowledge andunderstanding pouring into my conscioustiess, I went public with whatI was experiencing and began my period of immense public ridicule -the “turquoise period” as I call it - when I was obsessed with that colourfor more than a month. I didn’t know what was going on and I didn’tfor many years that followed. But now I do. The sexual relationshipwith another consciousness had, in part, created the vibrational triggerwhich helped to open the root and sacral chakras and allowed thekundalini to flood my aura, activating my emotional, mental andspiritual chakra centres as it rose through my body. Suddenly each ofthose chakras was also opened, so flooding my aura with theirknowledge and connecting me with higher levels of myself from whichmy mind had been delinked, at least consciously, until that moment. Isit any wonder I was in such a spin at the time? It was like sitting in aroom with 50 televisions blaring out at once and all tuned to a differentstation offering different information. The kundalini doesn’t have toaffect you like that, it can happen much less traumatically, but it wasan immense learning experience for me and those around me. It alsohappened at exactly the right time. Had that transformation happenedany earlier, I would not have experienced life in the programmed worldwith all the delusions and emotions that come from that. It was soimportant to live those experiences, given what I am doing now.Because of the abuse of sex by the church, state, and tabloid media,it has become a ‘’sin’’ and a reason for enormous guilt andcondemnation to have a sexual relationship with more than one personat the same time. If you are married as well, aaaaaahhhh! String himup, put him in the stocks. He’s unfit to be alive. While the churchparrots the cliche’s about the world needing more love, the momentyou express that love physically for more than one person, it suddenlybecomes a terrible thing. Of course love does not have to take a sexualexpression, and in all but a few cases during our lives, it will not. Butit can be reflected physically if that is right for the evolution of thepeople involved and if we and society cannot accept this, we arerevealing just how immature we are as a human race - and howinsecure. You can love more than one person at the same time. Manypeople, even those on the spiritual path, tell me it can’t be done - but it"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"167can. It can. You love them in different ways, that’s all. The focus andnature of that love may change at different times, but it is still love.This is not easy in the world today, I know. However, I believe it ispossible. We are One Consciousness. Are we really saying that we canonly love, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually, one aspectof ourselves at one time? Are we really? My God. Many people whosay they love someone unconditionally, later reveal otherwise as the“league tables” start to appear: “You spend more time with this personthan me” or “You do this for that person, but not for me”. Relationshipswhich begin (or think they do) on the basis of no-agenda love so oftendegenerate into league table love and their purity is lost. Unconditionallove does not have league tables, it just loves. Totally and always.Each person gives us something others cannot, because everyone isdifferent. If we celebrate the fact that we are unique, we can see howwe can gain knowledge, understanding and a greater insight into loveand ourselves, by experiencing and interacting with different people indifferent ways. Our love for one does not have to diminish our love foranother; indeed that love can grow as we truly understand what loveis, and our power to express love expands. I know from my own journeythese past few years that as the kundalini flows and opens us to ourmultidimensional wonder, parts of our personality emerge that wedidn’t know we had. It’s like pulling the cord on one of those automaticlife rafts. Suddenly our consciousness, locked and folded away for solong, unfurls and expands to produce a structure so large that you wouldnot believe it was achievable when you look at the small space (theclosed mind) from whence it came. These newly-freed parts of us needa focus of expression through people who are compatible with them.Different parts of our eternal self sometimes need stimulation bydifferent people. This way all elements of self are activated, stimulatedand challenged to grow and not only those which relate to the state ofbeing of one person or partner. This goes both ways. One person can’tgive me all that I need to grow multidimensionally and neither can I dothat for them. No one person can provide everything another will needfor their evolution to Oneness, but - and this is the point - themanipulation from the Fourth Dimension over thousands of years hasmade society think this is possible and this myth has even beeninstitutionalised and made part of state law. This is crazy. What are wedoing to ourselves?The effects on human life and intelligence of this ignorance of sexhas been fundamental to our plight. It has created another vicious cycle"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"168of fear, guilt and resentment. Here is just one scenario to make thepoint. If a man or woman feels the intuitive urge to become close witha person other than their marriage or regular partner, they can eithersuppress that urge because they fear the consequences in a society thatdoesn’t understand, or they can go ahead and feel terribly guiltybecause they, too, have been conditioned to believe that this is seriouslywrong. Either way their root, sacral and emotional chakras are throwninto vibratory turmoil and the flow of kundalini becomes diminishedand imbalanced. When the marriage partner finds out about therelationship, he or she will be overwhelmed with resentment and asthat resentment relates to sexuality, their root, sacral and emotionalchakras close down or imbalance the kundalini. This will not only affectthe sexuality of the three people, it will diminish them emotionally,intellectually and spiritually as the other chakra centres lose theirpowerful connection with the energy that fires them on the physical -the kundalini. Yet it is not that these relationship situations are wrong,merely that society is conditioned to believe they are wrong. Thesesituations are not right or wrong, they just are. They are part of theunique journey of learning and experience for all involved. Otherswon’t need that experience and so it won’t happen to them. They’ll bechallenged in other ways. If we were all born into a world in which thewider understanding and openness about sex were accepted, the paincaused by relationships and sex would plummet. As it is we areprogrammed to feel pain when certain circumstances arise and so wedo. This is why it is such a challenge for those seeking to expose thisimprisonment. We are doing it within a collective consciousness thathas been programmed to condemn, judge, and see the world andthemselves through a microscopic tunnel vision. But this will changeand it is changing. You watch.Religion has been the major force for the fourth dimensionalmanipulation to delink humanity from its true destiny and the abuse ofsex has been at the forefront of this. They have gone so far in somereligions as to make celibacy a virtue. How do you find the key toheaven? You cross your legs, bite your lip, and have buckets of coldwater at the ready.

How soon can you get here?The legacy of fear and guilt which religion has passed across thegenerations in its arrogant, childish and manipulative view of sexbeggars belief.

If people choose to becelibate, that’s fine. We should all do what we feel is right for us andwe don’t have to have sex to awaken the kundalini. It can be donethrough meditation and visualisation too, and it is also triggered byastrological influences. But if people practice celibacy withoutunderstanding about the kundalini some very unpleasant events canensue. If the kundalini is suppressed because of the sexual urges it isstimulating, this creates an energy “war” between the kundalini whichwishes to unfurl and the person’s mind and emotions which are seekingto push it back. This vibrational conflict can manifest as severelyimbalanced sexuality and other mental and emotional disharmony. It isno mystery why, as is now evident, the sexual abuse of children in theRoman Catholic Church has been so rife. It is an expression of animbalanced kundalini caused by suppressing a natural process of humandevelopment and, on many occasions, the Satanic manipulation of achild’s sexual energy in line with the black magic practices of the Cultof the All Seeing Eye. Nor is it a mystery why that church, from thePope down, has such a limited vision of life, humanity and creation.Without the kundalini flowing powerfully to activate and open thegateways to intellectual and spiritual infinity, the vision must alwaysbe barely one dimensional. Also, that which feels fear will project fear.Most religions fear sex and therefore use the fear of sex to manipulateand control.But what is true of the church is equally true of the tabloid mediaand pornography. If people want to pose naked for photographs doingthings with their bits and bobs, that’s OK by me. And if others want tobuy those papers and look at those pictures, that’s equally OK. I’m notseeking to judge, merely to point out what I believe are theconsequences of certain actions. The hypocrisy of the tabloid mediamirrors that of the church. They sell their papers through sexualtitillation, but then moralise about the sexual behaviour of the verypeople whose “exposure” sells their newspapers. When I was ajournalist working for a news agency in the 1970s, I had a call fromthe London News Of The World to ask me if there had been any courtcases in my area that week involving rape. The News Of The World didnot, I was told, have enough rape cases for that week’s paper. This isthe mentality that publicly judges the lives of others!

They want the erection, butcondemn the connection. They have turned sex, the most beautiful andecstatic state a physical form can produce, into the equivalent of artificialinsemination. The cosmic orgasm has descended into “Cor, I’d give ‘erone”. This view of sex is equally destructive to that of the church if itdoesn’t evolve into something much greater. Sex is not a series of quickgropes which momentarily satisfy merely physical desires. That is notof the spirit because it denies the spirit and diminishes the spirit. Thesexual experience stays in the root and lower c’hakras because it isoperating overwhelmingly as a physical exchange. This, too, suppressesand perverts the kundalini with all the effects that has on the emotional,mental and spiritual development of that human being. The misuse andmanipulation of sex by these apparent “opposites”, religion and themedia, has led both to massive guilt, fear and resentment in our attitudeto sex, and via a suppressed and imbalanced kundalini, to a disconnectionfrom our higher mental and spiritual potential. Put another way, rootchakra sex, as promoted by religion and the tabloids, can keep you in amental and emotional prison while cosmic sex can lift you to the stars. Itis appropriate that tabloid newspapers which are obsessed with quick-bonk sex also treat their readers like intellectual buffoons. One is aconsequence of the other.So what is sex at the cosmic level?Sex has become for so many a physical event when it really has thepotential to be a multidimensional ecstasy. There is root chakra sex, anoverwhelmingly physical experience, the goal of which is ejaculation -the outward projection of energy, an energy loss. This leaves thepartners tired and often with a sense of anticlimax and emptiness. Wasthat it? This is the view of sex found in the tabloid newspapers andpornography. Then there is multichakra sex which takes us soaring intothe spiritual realms of being. This is when the energy stimulated in theroot chakra rises through all the chakras and explodes outwards intothe aura as a spiritual orgasm rather than just physical ejaculation,although it can be a combination of both. This is spiritual love ratherthan sex because it is predominantly spiritual, not physical. It is whenboth partners merge into a male-female wholeness which raises theircollective consciousness to vibratory levels which connect them withhigher states of consciousness - Oneness. Sex at that level of awarenesstakes us into timelessness when we are without thought, fear, guilt or"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"171resentment. We just “are”. We are out of our bodies and into our deeperself, out of our heads and into our feelings, our spirit (Figure 11overleaf). We withdraw from this programmed world and access levelsof consciousness far beyond this physical planet. When I haveexperienced spiritual love in this way, I have felt a fantastic flow ofinformation, love and insight, pouring into my mind in the minutes andhours that followed, because the multichakra orgasm has lifted myconsciousness to the vibratory levels which hold that information andlove. It is like making love during an earthquake! Such an amazinglevel of spiritual love and vibrational connection between two peopleis so rare. Mostly we travel through many lifetimes without feeling thatindescribable, multidimensional harmony with another human beingwhich explodes as an immensely powerful creative force - love in itspurest expression. When you have felt that with someone you may nolonger need or desire to express love physically with another. You knowinstinctively that nothing could compare with the connection you havewith that person. So you see I am not calling for a sexual free for allhere. Not least because when we have sex we merge to a larger or lesserextent with the energies of the other person. We absorb, vibrationally,part of them, their very essence. Who we make love with, and on whatlevel it is expressed, has consequences for both partners long after theactual event. All I am saying is that, it is not right or wrong to makelove with more than one person. It is merely an experience along theroad to finding that spiritual-sexual ecstacy. Once you have experiencedthat - and you’ll know when you have!you can often spend the rest of your life with that person and neverneed a sexual union with anyone else. There are no norms, onlyexperiences on the road to Oneness. Everyone is different and needs toexperience different things.Cosmic sex leaves you ablaze with energy, rather than tired, and thisis transmitted to every cell in the body, stimulating them to vibratequicker and so make us feel “alive”. There is an energy gain ratherthan a loss. This provides us with more creative energy to express inother areas of our lives. There is nothing wrong with ejaculation, there’snothing wrong with anything as long as it is not imposed againstanother’s will, but there is a much greater meaning to sex than the verynarrow idea of sexual release and relief that we are conditioned toaccept. A mixture of all possibilities offers the range of all experienceand potential.

Is he any good in bed? Is she goodbetween the sheets? Do I satisfy my man/woman? Am I good at it?This has brought yet more fear to the sexual experience because eachpartner is trying to “perform” for the other. Sod that. It is not aperformance. It is not a doing, it is a being. If you relax and just “be”without trying to do or achieve anything, you begin to let go of theprogrammed responses of what sex is or isn’t. If you don’t focus yourmind on the end goal (ejaculation and orgasm), you enter timeless,relaxed states of higher consciousness for far longer. You can onlyenjoy each moment to its greatest potential if you get your head out ofthe past and the future. Ejaculation and orgasm are in the future and ifthat is in your head from the start, you lose the power of each moment.To do that, means simply to “be” without thoughts of what may or maynot be to come, if you’ll pardon the expression.

The course of evolution is very simple:experience, learn, evolve. The rules and regulations, the dos, don’ts,musts, and mustn’ts, imposed over the centuries by religions and otherthought controllers, have narrowed dramatically the depth and breadthof experience that we are allowed to have before meeting theresistance of ridicule or condemnation. We have become afraid toexperience and this has become ingrained as a fear of change becausechange experience. We cling to ways of life and attitudes which willnot bring new experience because we have been conditioned to fearexperience. Life becomes a series of tedious repetitions and it is thisvery repetition of thought and behaviour that makes us so easy tocontrol. Western society’s view of sex is a most potent example ofthis. Once you have a marriage certificate, you are no longer supposedto have any sexual experience with anyone except your official partner.This seeks to deny a massive area of experience, therefore learning,therefore evolution. Many people are so insecure within themselvesthat they hold their partner in emotional handcuffs and go crazy if theyeven talk to another man or woman. Others are more open and don’tso much mind an intellectual interaction between their partner and amember of another sex. But all, except a tiny, tiny few highlyenlightened beings have a major emotional block with the thought oftheir partner making love physically with another. It is the physicalexperience that stimulates all the pain, guilt and resentment. Iunderstand this and I’m not saying that sex with other partners is goodor bad, nor right or wrong, only that it is a choice that people have aright to make without condemnation. The body is the outwardexpression of the mind-emotions-spirit, the mind made physical. It isa way for two human beings to express love for each other and sharetheir energy if that is what they choose to do. Again I ask: what thehell is the big deal?

That is immoral? That is a reason for guilt,resentment and condemnation?What on Earth have we come to? Rock bloody bottom,that’s where we’ve come to - and the only way is up.Morality always means limitation and hypocrisy. Morality you can’t.It denies a basic human right - the right to experience and to be whoand what we uniquely are. Morality sets out someone else’s view ofthe perfect human being and demands that everyone conforms to that.Such morality requires an arrogance of genuine world class. Becauseno-one matches the blueprint of this “perfect” human (including, oftenespecially, the moralist who makes the blueprint), everyone goes arounddenying their real feelings or feeling guilty for not conforming to theblueprint. Because society gives a hard time to anyone falling belowthe standards set by the moralists, people put up the masks and try tokid everyone that they are living “moral” lives even when they are not.It is a world of denial, fear, lies, hypocrisy and secrecy. It need not be.It only happens because we fear what other people think of us and whatother people think of us is conditioned by the few who decide the socalled “standards”.We are back to the Hassle-Free Zones again. Yet who are thesemoralists who tell us what we can and can’t experience? From myobservations, they are seriously screwed up emotionally and, ironically,screwed up about the very issue they are moralising about. When yousuppress something, it takes on a much greater importance. When youwant to lose weight, food is on your mind far more than when you areeating what you choose. Denial always stimulates an obsession withwhatever you are denying. Instead of the energy flowing through youin a harmonious, natural way, as it does when you allow yourself to gowith that flow, it recycles itself around your energy fields, so staying atthe centre of your thoughts. If you seek to deny your sexual feelings,you will be thinking of sex far more than if you flow with your feelings.The moralists who seek to suppress their own sexual feelings becauseof fear and guilt, then become obsessed with the sexual activity ofothers. You recognise the type: “This sex movie is a moral outrage and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"176I should know - I’ve seen it five times”.

We live forever. What isone experience? If you don’t like it and it doesn’t work out, you learnfrom the experience and evolve. If you do like it and it does work out,you also learn from the experience and evolve. Again, experience isnot good or bad, it just is. One thing is for sure, the more you denyyourself the experiences your inner self is leading you into, the moreturmoil you feel as the conflict ensues in your psyche and the longer itwill take for you to reach higher levels of understanding. I feel we needto let go of the absolutes which deny us so much. These absolutes showthemselves in phrases like “right, that’s it, it’s over forever” or “I’llnever talk to that person again” or “I would never do that, not ever”.Apart from life itself, nothing is forever and nothing is for never. All isthere to experience on the road to Oneness. Everything in Creation isconstantly moving, every expression of energy is dancing to thechanging rhythm of life. If we seek to stand still and to turn our livesand attitudes into concrete thought patterns and rigid predictability, weare in fact trying to stand still in a fast flowing river and soon it will bea tidal wave as the vibes continue to quicken. We seek to be staticeggshells while surrounded by a vibrational sea of movement and flow.No wonder that life is such a mental, emotional and physical battle inthose circumstances. You are literally using all your energy just to standstill! But whether you welcome and celebrate experience or whetheryou deny it, doesn’t really matter. Either way you will get there in theend. Denial just means it takes longer and causes you a great deal ofemotional turmoil which you could avoid if you allow rather than denyyour feelings. The point I am making is that we should have the right,without pressure, ridicule or condemnation, to make our own choiceabout what we experience without some moralising know-it-alldictating what we can and can’t do. For instance, what ishomosexuality? It is an experience, that’s all it is, a way of expressinglove for another human being, another aspect of ourselves. Two menor women loving each other deeply and sexually is considered a moraloutrage, while a man and a woman hating each other and living togetherin a marriage they are both too frightened to end, is consideredacceptable. My philosophy is to allow all experience as long as the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"177people involved have made that decision from their own free-willwithout pressure or imposition of any kind.(I guess becoming a member of the Christian Moral Crusade is nowout of the question? It is? Phew, thank goodness for that.)Creation consists of a sea of relationships. Creation is relationshipsthe relationships between atoms, electrons, vibrational states, people,communities, countries, stars, planets, galaxies, and so on. There arealso the relationships, often forgotten, between people and the rest ofthe Earth family like the trees, flowers, air, water, animals, insects andthe spirit of Mother Earth. So many of these relationships have becomebased on domination rather than love. Whether it is a man dominatinghis wife or partner (or vice versa) to impose his views and beliefs onthe relationship, or humankind seeking to dominate the animals andthe natural world, the picture we see is of one “side” of a relationshipseeking to change and mould the other to fit in with their view of howthings should be. Of course this is not always the case, there are noabsolutes, but it is overwhelmingly what I see happening. You cannotdivorce the way we view our relationships with other lifeforms on theplanet from the way we view our relationships with each other. All aremanifestations of the same state of mind - a wish to impose rather thanto respect and love. When we stop abusing ourselves, we’ll stopabusing the planet. Marriage and partnerships in general have becomea prison of imposition and denial. The insecurity of one partner,sometimes both, wishes to preserve its misguided sense of security bydictating the terms of the relationship with another. This leads to a“love” which says: I love you if you conform to what I believe youshould be. This is light years away from: I love you whatever you say,do or think. Love in its purest, most magical form, has no ifs or buts ormaybes. Love is to desire what is best for another, even if it is not whatwe wish to happen from our own standpoint. Love in its purest formcan also step back emotionally and allow someone to go through anegative experience rather than protect them from a learningopportunity that will speed their understanding of life and themselves.The greatest love anyone can have for another is to let them go, if thatis what is best for them, on their journey of evolution throughexperience. It is certainly to allow them, without judgement orwithdrawal of love, to experience whatever they need to experience tospeed their journey to Oneness. Love is not only to say: I love beingwith you or I love to go to bed with you. Love is to love someone socompletely that nothing they can ever do could destroy the way you"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"178feel about them. How many people on this planet love each other by thatdefinition of love? Exactly. We want to impose our blueprint on othersand only if people conform to that do we love them, or rather think welove them. Needing someone and loving someone are not the same thing.As the consciousness of humanity continues to awaken to its full andglorious potential, these relationships will fade and die They reflect ourold, narrow sense of self and reality, not the one we are moving into.Relationships have been replicas of the fear and insecurity that hasswamped the human psyche for thousands of years. This insecurity hasled to the prison cell marriage and the submission to another’s will forfear of losing them. Marriage and relationships have also become Hassle-Free Zones. We fear being alone if we express our uniqueness becausewe lack self esteem and inner security. We have lost our “wholeness”because we have switched off our multidimensional selves.Relationships, like marriage, have consisted of two “halves” seeking tomake a whole. The male seeks to balance himself in a relationship witha female rather than balancing his male-female harmony by accessingthe female within his own psyche. Macho man denies his female polarityand searches for that polarity in a woman. This has created relationshipswhich suffocate and imprison rather than set free (Figure 12a) becausethe partnership becomes one entity in which two halves struggle fordominance or submit to dominance. The same applies to the womansearching for her male polarity in a man instead of in herself. This isabout to change dramatically and, indeed, is already doing so. Peoplewho are evacuating the Hassle-Free Zones and opening themselves totheir multidimensional wholeness do not need to secure their “other half”in a relationship with a man or a woman. They are already whole ormoving that way, thank you very much.In the face of this, relationships are going to experience a colossaltransformation. Suddenly two “wholes” will be relating to each otherand once we evolve towards wholeness, balance, and completeness,there is no way we will accept the imposition upon us of another’sblueprint. Wholeness celebrates its uniqueness and refuses to be a cloneof someone else. These new relationships look, symbolically, verydifferent to those we see today (Figure 12b). Instead of one partnerdominating, both respect the other’s right to be unique. This respectand acknowledgement of another’s right to be themselves and to followthe experiences that come their way creates a fantastic bond betweentwo people.

Many people will not live togetherand even those who do will insist on their own “space”. This mightalso mean relationships, even sexual ones, with other people. I’m notsaying that it has to mean that, only that it can. But because such peoplehave accessed the real meaning of love and the bond between themgrows rather than diminishes, with the passage of time and experience,whatever it is. As I said earlier, I hear people talk about the need forunconditional love and they even lecture others on how important it is.But they don’t live it themselves. Their own love is still conditional onanother person conforming to their blueprint. My partner for 25 years,Linda, is one of the small number of people I have met in my life whounderstands the meaning of unconditional love. She is living it, notbullshitting about it, and that makes her an astonishing woman. Ourrelationship is in the process of great change and maybe we won’t betogether as we have been in the past. But the bond of love between usremains and will always do so because the love is without condition.Whatever happens to either of us on our journey to Oneness, that loveand connection will be there, no matter what the distance between usin either miles or attitudes. People may change, even partners maychange, but unconditional love lives on, no matter what. Unconditionallove is not some trite phrase, it is a state of being that will transformthe world. But only if we stop just talking about it and start meaningwhat we say and living what we say. Equally vital, it will only happenif we allow everyone to live unconditional love without moralising orseeking to frighten and hassle them into conforming to the blueprint ofanother.GREAT EXPECTATIONSThis brings me to the greatest destroyer of relationships and a primecreator of emotional distress: expectations. We go through our livesthinking we are living in the present when in truth we are living in thepast and the future. There are those who believe that the past, presentand future are happening at the same time and I agree with that, butthey are happening on different vibrations. We need to decide which ofthose vibrations we wish to occupy. We live in the past because of theguilt and resentment we hold onto and we live in the future because"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"181we fear what is to come. Expectations also keep us, mentally andemotionally, in the future. All the time we have expectations of whatwill happen, how a person will behave, what they will do and say.Then, when that person does not react in the way we expected, we aredisappointed. We may lose our temper with them or sulk or tell ourfriends how disappointed we were with someone’s behaviour. He orshe was nothing like I expected, we say. But hold on just a second.It’s not that person’s fault that they did not “come up to expectations”.They had no input in deciding what those expectations were going tobe. They were just being themselves, which is all anyone can be. Itwas the person who created the expectations who created thesubsequent disappointment. This disappointment is caused bysomeone not conforming to the expectations created by someone else.If there were no expectations, there would be no disappointment. Andwithout expectations we live in the present, not the future, and weenjoy each moment as it happens without destroying that enjoymentwith the disappointment of unfulfilled expectations. You go to a soccermatch expecting your team to win and they don’t. You aredisappointed. You go to the same soccer match just to enjoy the gamewith no expectations of who will win, nor any great emotionalattachment to either team, and you are not disappointed, whicheverteam loses. You just enjoy the game as it happens. So it is with life.Expectations = disappointment. No expectations = living each momentin that moment. Expectations also focus our minds on a very narrowarea of potential experience - what we expect the experience to be.Once we let go of expectations, our mind walks free from that limitedvision of possible experience and opens itself to all possibleexperience. We see this phenomena in action when people go to a filmexpecting not to like it and, because of that state of mind, they usuallydon’t. If, however, they had gone to the cinema with no expectationsthey would have allowed that openness of mind to enjoy the picturebecause there were no expections of unenjoyment which they weretrying so hard to fulfill.If you enter a relationship with expectations, sexual or otherwise, youare almost certainly going to be disappointed because people are notclones of our expectations of them. Why should they be? Whatarrogauce that we should demand of people that they be what we expectthem to be rather than to express what they really are. If we lovesomeone unconditionally, without demanding that they meet ourexpectations, the relationship takes on a whole new dimension and"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"182becomes much more stable and permanent. My symbolic representationof the new relationships, the two circles connected at the centre, is thefigure of eight - the symbol of infinity. This is appropriate becauserelationships founded on unconditional love with no expectations ofeach other are the only ones capable of infinity. The others eithercollapse because of unfulfilled expectations or the suffocation ofindividuality, or both partners accept the suppression of individualityand constant disappointment because they are too frightened to walkaway from their perceived “security”. Fear of the alternative is whatkeeps most, yes I would say most, relationships together. However, feardiminishes on the road to wholeness and Oneness and we are going tosee an explosion of partnership break downs as we evolve fromrelationships based on conditions and expectations to those based onunconditional love and respect for another’s right to individuality anduniqueness of experience. When we do this, we will live each momentas it happens without determining beforehand what we expect thatmoment to be and then being disappointed. We will live in the NOWnot the past or the future, and we will accept people for what they areand not for what we expect them to be. In the words of a Chris de Burghsong: Live every moment before the moment’s gone.I have realised from experience that one of the greatest obstacles toexpressing our true selves is the desire not to hurt someone. Wesuppress our feelings because we want to avoid the emotional hurt thatwe know our actions may bring. This is particularly applicable torelationships of all kinds. People stay in marriages because they wishto protect their partner and children from the pain of divorce, or theyworry that their parents will be upset if they follow their heart. But allthis does, in the end, is to cause even more pain and distress because aperson suppressing their real feelings and desires is at war withthemselves. Part of the psyche wants to go with the flow while anotherpart is desperately trying to dam the flow. The frustration and damagethis creates often manifests as simmering anger and resentment, whichdestroys the relationship in a much more long term and painful waythan simply being honest from the start and saying: “It’s time to go”.At its most extreme, the suppression of our uniqueness and the urgingswithin us can cause so much pent up frustration that it explodes asviolence, crime, depression, illness and even suicide. Suppressinguniqueness with a stream of rules, regulations and “moral” absolutes issupposed to protect society from violence and crime when, in fact, it is"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"183causing them. In a world in which people are conditioned to acceptsuch a narrow version of “life”, there are bound to be people who arehurt and upset when we express our real, unconditioned selves. Thealternative to that is to stay in jail forever and a day. The point is this:is it your intention to hurt someone? No, of course not. You are justbeing you and going where your heart leads you. If you suppress thatyou are allowing your life to be controlled by the attitudes of anotherand not your own. You become a puppet on the strings of anotherperson’s emotions and beliefs. It is hard to say and do things that youknow will cause hurt to someone you care for, but often you are alsocreating an experience which sets them free, too. In the process ofexpressing your real self, you are helping to shatter their status quoprison of the mind and give them the opportunity to regain and expresstheir true and infinite power. How often do we hear people say that anexperience which was traumatic in the moment has turned out to bethe best thing that ever happened to them? In this era of change andself re-appraisal, it is time to be honest with ourselves and honest withothers about the way we feel.For all this to happen in a harmonious way, it is necessary to let goof our emotional dependency on each other. By that I don’t mean thatwe cease to love people and feel wonderful when they are around. Thatis an incredible and blissful feeling. I mean to still be OK withinourselves when they are not around. That is not easy in a worldconditioned by the guilt-resentment-fear-expectation view ofrelationships, but it is possible if you are prepared to work through theinitial and understandable pain in the transition period. And as weattract to us what we most fear, if we don’t let go of the fear of losinganother, we will lose them. Only in that way can we experience thatloss, find our own inner strength and self esteem to stand alone ifnecessary, and let go of that fear. When we release the fear of beingalone, we will no longer be alone because the lesson will have beenlearned and the evolution achieved. That’s the idea behind creating ourown reality growth, not punishment. The only person who punishes usis ourselves. Untying our emotional dependency on another person orlifestyle, is to stop taking on other people’s problems. We tend to lockinto the emotional ups and downs of each other. When one partner isdepressed or wound up, the other starts to feel the same. But all thatcreates is two people feeling depressed rather than one. What good isthat? What is making one person feel down is their own problem and itis for them to sort out.

Otherpeople’s emotional problems are not yours, they are the creation of theperson involved no matter what the circumstances. That means onlythey can sort them out. If we take on their emotional states, we actuallyhinder rather than help them to emerge through that emotional mire. Ifyou stay independent from people emotionally you will be in a betterposition to give them what they most need in those circumstances.. lovein its truest and widest sense. I am having some t-shirts produced whichsay:“Piss off, I’m having a bad day... don’t take it personally.”That’s a key to harmony in relationships of all kinds, whether it be amarriage or parents or people at work. When people act towards us inways we don’t like, they are expressing their sense of self at thatmoment and they are mirroring back at us something that we canaddress and learn from. It’s a movie playing to an ever changing andevolving script. You can love all the other actors in the movie withouttaking over their parts or reading their lines. Don’t take it personally. Itis never personal. It is always someone dealing with their ownemotional garbage which far from relating directly to you may go backthousands of years. You are just the trigger for that suppressed emotionand others are triggers for you. Let’s get out of the Earthly personalityand into the eternity of it all. However people behave towards us oranyone else, just love them. The more negatively they act, the morelove they are crying out for. We don’t have to approve of their actionsto love them. Yet what do we do? We give our love to those whoconform to our blueprint, our expectations, and deny love to those whodon’t. As almost no-one conforms to that blueprint we truly love almostno-one, usually no-one. Because others are insisting that we conformto their blueprints, almost no-one, usually no-one, truly loves us. Thisis why the world is so short of love. Everyone is laying down theconditions for it. We’ll have lawyers producing contracts which say “Ipromise to love you in return for the following...”. Love is about lovingwithout conditions of any kind. Love is never, never, never about thepossession and ownership of another mind, body, emotion or spirit.Love is independent from emotional ties which diminish love in itsgreatest and most unconditional form. Only without that emotionaldependence can love give us what we need to experience and not"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"185necessarily what we want to experience. In my first book on thesesubjects, The Truth Vibrations, I quoted a channelled2 message whichsums up all that I have said here about love and relationships:“True love does not always give the receiver what it would like toreceive, but it will always give that which is best for it. So welcomeeverything you receive whether you like it or not. Ponder on anythingyou do not like and see if you can see why it was necessary. Acceptancewill then be very much easier.”Love is to become independent of someone emotionally to the pointwhere you can help them experience what they need to experience tospeed their evolution to Oneness. What we have called “love” in thisworld has often been the very opposite of that definition. It has sought todeny experience, not to encourage it; to possess, not to set free; to ex-pect,not to re-spect. A re-evaluation of love is emerging to sweep away thelimitations and launch us into limitlessness. After all, those limits are ofour own making. If we didn’t create them, they could not exist.What I have said in this chapter is fundamentally different to theviews of sex and relationships which you will hear in what we call“society” - the Hassle-Free Zone. Many will think that what I say is amoral outrage because the thought of people loving each otherunconditionally, including sexually sometimes, is outrageous tomoralists and those who take their off-the-peg opinions from them. Butthat sense of outrage speaks volumes about the state of being of themoralist, not my own. I believe in allowing people to be what they are,to learn, and to evolve to something greater. I believe that people canlove more than one person, even physically, at the same time and thatthe energy called love is without limits. The flow of love can never rundry. Whether we express it or suppress it is merely a choice that we allmake in every moment. The right to love and be loved is in our ownminds and our own hearts. Love is on tap whenever we choose. It is2 Channelling is when someone tones their consciousness to another wavelength of realityand becomes the vibrational bridge between that wavelength and this one. Thought fields aresent from a higher wavelength through the “medium” or “channeller” who turns thosethought fields into spoken or written words. It is a means for one dimension to communicatewith another. Some channelling produces inspired information, some a load of old nonsense.It depends on the levels with which the channeller is communicating and how skillfully theycan suppress their own personality and thoughts to allow the information to come through inthe form that it was sent."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"186only a choice. If saying all that is an outrage, then I guess I must beoutrageous. Good.The abuse and denial of love and its physical expression have doneserious damage to human evolution. It has suppressed and imbalancedthe kundalini and in doing so it has delinked us from our true sexual,intellectual, emotional and spiritual potential. The imbalanced,uncontrolled power of the kundalini, caused by fear, guilt and denial,has also led to sexual abuse, aggression, hatred, suicide, inner conflictand global war. It has been like trying to stop a flow of water bypressing your thumb against the tap. The water spurts everywhere, outof control. So it is, symbolically, with the kundalini when you try tohold back its natural, God-given flow. This has scrambled the humanpsyche when, if it is allowed to flow naturally and without emotionalhindrance, the kundalini has the potential to take us home tomultidimensional Oneness. Relax. What you are and what you do needsno excuses. Only when we grow up as a human race, and stop dictatingto each other what we should be, do, say and experience, will peoplebegin to relax with themselves and have the inner peace to allow thekundalini to do its work without fear of the experiences that will bring.And we can grow up now, today, this second.

It’s time to move on.Most people have forgotten how long we have all worked for this.We have played our parts as goodies and baddies, victors, victims andvillains, and we have learned so much about the consequences ofseparation. We crave once again for a return to the Oneness weremember deep in our consciousness, a memory that makes so muchmore painful and frustrating the world we observe today. We turn todrugs and booze to shut out that pain and to escape all too briefly fromthe emotional turmoil that separation has created. Deep inside weknow what is possible and it hurts to see how far we have fallen intothe pit of ignorance.

The Thirdand Fourth Dimensions of consciousness are merging into the FifthDimension. It is like a ladder being pulled up until, eventually, thewhole vortex/pyramid returns to Oneness. The structure which createseach of the dimensions is an energy “net” or “web” called a matrix(Figure 13 overleaf). You might think of it as the steel structure of abuilding. The multiscreen cinema is a series of matrixes interconnectingwith each other.

The human body is also a matrix and the energy linesof the body matrix provide the basis of the ancient healing art ofacupuncture. Again you could relate this matrix structure to thoseRussian dolls, one inside the other, with the biggest one encompassingall of them. The matrix energy web sets the format and nature of eachdimension, universe, galaxy, solar system and planet, and everythingthat exists within them. It is a gigantic thought form created byOneness. It’s the movie screen, if you like. The matrix is the blueprint,the “computer program, which creates and holds together this three-dimensional world and interconnects with all the other matrix levels.When a matrix changes, everything within it changes, and our matrixis changing... now! In fact they all are, on every level of the vortex andwe are heading for a fantastic multidimensional galactic orgasm.A matrix is the collective mind of all that exists on each dimensionand so it is with every level. The Earth matrix, for example, is thecollective mind of all that exists on this planet. It is the collective mindof humanity. Our thoughts are absorbed by the matrix “computer” andat that level all that has happened on the Earth is recorded and stored.This is one source of the so called Akashic Records which manypsychics access when they are recalling past events and past lives. Theyare tuning their consciousness to the vibratory “library”, the matrix,which holds that information. I guess this could be an origin of theancient idea of “God” recording our every move. Sure beats a notebook.The matrix is also a source of information for the “prophets” andpsychics, ancient and modern, who “see” the future. It is not the futurethat will definitely be. It is the future that will be if we don’t change.Each matrix mind takes all information available, including currenthuman attitudes and behaviour, and projects forward how the futurewill turn out on current trends. This is the “future” which people likeNostradamus and others have connected with. It exists as a thoughtfield created by a matrix mind. The future is not set in concrete. If wechange, it changes, because we create the future reality as we createour present reality. Our thoughts and attitudes are affecting the Earthmatrix and, through that, affecting the thoughts and attitudes ofeveryone connected to the matrix - all of us. You could see itsymbolically as everyone connected to a computer program and eachof us slightly rewriting that program with each thought, word, andaction. Researchers have documented the “hundredth monkeysyndrome” which very much relates to the matrix structure. They haveshown that once a certain number of a species has been taught"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"190something new, suddenly all or most of that species can do the samepurely by “inspiration” and without being shown. How does thishappen? Simple. A few members of a species learn something new untilthe critical mass point is reached where the sum total of their knowledgeis powerful enough within the matrix for the rest of the species to accessthe information. As a result they “know” how to do something withoutbeing shown. This appears to be a mystery, but it isn’t. They are tuninginto the matrix, the collective mind.This process can also affect us negatively of course and the Earthmatrix has become a prison of programmed, imbalanced thought. TheEarth matrix has long been dominated by the herd mentality and otherclassic human reactions and responses explored in this book, becauseso many “individual” minds have chosen to think like that. This can beself-perpetuating because the matrix absorbs this mentality and thenfeeds those attitudes back to the human race. It has set in motion acycle of individual minds thinking limitation, which together create asense of limitation in the collective mind, the Earth matrix, which thenfreds limitation of thought back to human minds, which then think ineven more limited terms, which then.. you get the idea. The Earthmatrix has become a global eggshell which has closed down thechannels to other levels and dimensions of creation. It has been likeliving in a vibrational box with the lid locked down. This is the processthrough which humanity has become stuck in a rut of intergenerationalnon-thinking and desperately limited vision. Billions of people whochoose not to think for themselves become dominated by the deeplyingrained patterns held within the Earth matrix. In effect, the matrixmind thinks for them. They are its robots and they have been able tolive out an entire physical lifetime without having a single thought thatoriginated with them. Patterns of fear, guilt, resentment, judgment andlow self esteem are repeated generation after generation in this way. Itis the symbolic record needle stuck in the groove. This has been theconsequence of the cycle of limitation looping between human mindsand the Earth matrix mind. That is the cycle we are now in the processof breaking. With every mind that opens and sees life in a new way,the matrix mind is affected. Eventually there comes the point of criticalmass, the hundredth monkey, when enough people have changed theirattitudes and sense of reality to “switch” the Earth matrix reality fromlimitation to limitlessness, from can’t to can, from wanna-be to gonna-be.

Thishas been caused by all the mental and emotional gunge that hasswamped the Earth matrix mind. As a result of this, it has acted a littlelike a dam, holding back from most human consciousness all that existsbeyond the dense physical reality. Some people on the planet haveexpanded their consciousness to access levels beyond the Earth matrixand at that point they see life with a totally different perspective. Theprison door opens. But for the overwhelming majority of people, theyare accessing only the Earth matrix with all its limitation of thoughtand emotional sewage. Just as the human subconscious needs to becleansed of its emotional crap, so does the Earth matrix. Indeed thetwo are the same. The Earth will therefore be releasing her pent upemotions in the same way that humanity is now doing so. Strap in andhold tight! The shift is hitting the fan! It is the emotional imbalances inthe Earth matrix which has made it so much more difficult to connectwith our multidimensional selves. When all the matrix levels are inpowerful connection, it means that to tune to one is to tune to all.Connecting with the Earth matrix offers the potential for yourconsciousness to be as big as the Earth.

Sometimes this involves goingto certain points on the Earth’s surface, many, though certainly not all,of which are the places held sacred since ancient times. These includestone circles, mounds, hills, mountains and pre-Christian Earthworkswhich are sited at chakra and “acupuncture” points on the Earth matrix.Peoples of thousands of years ago knew far more about the cycles andstructure of life than do the letters-after-your-name scientists of today.The sacred sites, as they are often called, are points on the network ofenergy lines around and through the planet which have become knownas ley lines or meridians. Acupuncture involves putting tiny needles atcertain points on the meridian lines of energy that circle the human body.This balances the flow of energy and so keeps us free from disharmony,dis-ease. The same basic principle applies to the Earth. She has a grid ofenergy lines, acupuncture, and chakra points, at which people canbecome walking, talking, “acupuncture needles” and affect enormouschanges in the balance and imbalance of the energy flow within the Earthmatrix. The fourth dimensional manipulators have inspired thedestruction of so many major points on the grid with the siting of cities,power stations, roads and battlefields. The Cult of the All Seeing Eyesystematically arranges black magic rituals on these sites to fill them withnegative energy. They know that if they can hold down the vibration ofthe grid and imbalance it negatively this will ensure that humanity as awhole is operating within the “Satanic” frequency range. This delinkspeople from their multidimensional selves and makes them so easy toclose down, control and manipulate.

This is one reason for themysterious crop formations or “circles” which increased dramaticallyafter the end of the 1980s. Some have been hoaxed to divert our attentionfrom the genuine patterns and the realisation that they are harbingers ofenormous change. The crop formations are created by a higherintelligence using magnetic energy and the symbols they represent canoften be charted back to the ancient world. A symbol, a pattern, is alsoenergy, as is everything. These formations often appear on ley lines andon, or close to, Earth energy points. They are stimulating and windingup the power in the grid, the Earth matrix, and raising its vibration.

The new grid has beencreated on a higher dimension and it needs to be “grounded” in thisone to replace the old grid controlled by the Cult of the All Seeing Eye.The transformation in fact, is the introduction of this new matrix. Thenew grid has been created with heart energy - pure love - and it canonly be grounded by human beings vibrating within this frequencyrange known as love. When people open their hearts and allow theirunconditional love to flow, they lock in vibrationally to this energy fieldand “earth” it in this Third Dimension in much the same way aslightning is earthed by people and trees. More and more people areawakening to their higher guidance, opening their hearts and followingtheir intuition to energy sites, the acupuncture points on the Earth’ssurface. They then allow themselves to be used as channels to groundthe new love grid at those points. As this progresses - and it’s alreadywell advanced - the Global Elite’s control of the world will cease to bebecause their power to do it will be gone.Everything is electrical and magnetic energy. It is only that somethings are more powerfully electrical and magnetic than others. Quartzcrystals, for instance, are especially sensitive and powerful and this iswhy you find quartz-based stones used for stone circles around theworld. The ancients, probably with extraterrestrial inspiration, knewwhat they were doing. They didn’t choose those stones at random, theyunderstood at least the basis of what they could do. Quartz can storeand transmit energy and act as a receiver for energy frequencies.Research has also shown that at least the vast majority of standingstones and circles are built on or very close to faults on the Earth’ssurface which produce particular electrical and magnetic effects. Of the286 stone circles in Britain, 235 are built on rocks more than 250million years old, the statistical chances of which are in excess of amillion to one.1 Most UFO sightings are made on or very close to stonecircles and other sacred sites and ley lines. Many people believe thatthis is because of the electrical and magnetic “fuel” they provide forthese interdimensional craft, but it could also be that theelectromagnetic effects of ley lines and power points increase psychicawareness and make it easier to “see” what we call UFOs on otherdimensions and wavelengths. So you can see that the plundering of the1 Serena Roney-Dougal, Wlicee Science And Magic Meet, (Element Books, Shaftsbury,England, 1991) p156-157.

These rocks, crystalsand minerals are not where they are for their health - they are there toplay their roles in the electromagnetic balance of the Earth’s energyfield, our energy field.The power of the energy waxes and wanes as the seasons andplanetary influences affect the Earth’s magnetic field, thus the ancientshad their ceremonies to celebrate different points in nature’s cycle ofbirth and death, the ups and downs of the energy field. Sun rise andSun set are powerful times because of their effect on the energies. TheMoon, especially full Moon, affects people because of its magneticeffect on the Earth’s energy field and human consciousness. This is howit draws the tides in and out. A friend used to have a migraine headacheon every full Moon until she made the connection. She concluded thather consciousness was being “pulled” out of her body by the effect ofthe full Moon magnetism. She went outside in bare feet to make astrong magnetic connection with the Earth (no rubber soles) and theheadache immediately disappeared. When you touch a standing stoneor any rock, indeed anything, you are making an electrical and magneticcontact which allows the two way exchange of energy to occur. This iswhat is happening with hands on healing and, of course, sex. Sickpeople have been shown to have diminished power in their energyfields while the best healers have extremely powerful fields. Alternativehealing methods, psychic phenomena, dreams, strange sounds or lightsin the sky, stone circles, crops circles, pyramids, and an endless list ofother “mysteries” are all caused or inspired by electrical and magneticenergy fields and their relationship and interaction with each otheracross the dimensions of consciousness. People accept that lightningexists because they can see it. But that is merely an electromagneticphenomena happening within the frequency range of our physicalsenses. “Paranormal” phenomena are only the same principle at workon wavelengths that our physical senses often can’t see or feel, but ourhigher psychic senses can.

These are increasing the vibrational state of the global"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"195energy field. This must affect human consciousness because we arepart of that field and it must affect weather patterns, etc, which arealso an expression of that field. It is all very simple. The positiveelements in the Fourth Dimension, and higher, are working with thosemillions of humans who have opened their minds to this knowledge tomake the transformation of the global energy field as smooth aspossible. These people have been guided by higher dimensions ofthemselves to repair the old energy grid and, at the same time, help to“ground” the new one in this dimension. The plan is to raise thevibrational rate of the Earth to the limits of the old grid and then switchin the new. It is the same principle as switching from one computerprogram to another. Ideally this is a smooth process, like lock gates ona canal. The vibrational rate of the energy flowing through the ley linenetwork is raised to the highest level of the old grid; the symbolic lockgates then open; and the switch is made to the lowest level of the newgrid. From that point, the vibratory levels of the new grid will begradually wound up as human consciousness expands and is able totake that power of energy without being mentally and physically blownaway. However, because of what has happened, this is no idealsituation. The old grid has been in such a state that there is a gapbetween the highest vibrations it is capable of taking and the lowestlevels of the new one. At switchover time there will be a suddenvibrational “jump” across this gap which could send shock wavesthrough the Earth, very much like a sudden surge of electricity throughyour electrical system at home. Fuses may blow! How big thatvibrational leap has to be depends once again upon us. Are we goingto heal the grid with love or further diminish it with conflict? Are wegoing to speak our truth so that others may hear or are we going tostay in the shadows and hide how we feel through fear and insecurity?We are back to our old friend - choice.Speaking and thinking your truth is vital to this transformation. Everytime you think in ways that challenge the limitations, you aretransferring that knowledge to the Earth matrix and making anotherstep towards critical mass. When you speak in public, your words andthoughts are also absorbed by the Earth matrix and, more than that,they offer the audience the chance to hear the information. This openstheir minds to reject their sense of limitation and their thoughts alsoadd to critical mass. It’s the same with books. The process gets quickerand quicker and this is happening today.

This is because, likean acupuncture needle, when words and thoughts are created at thesepoints, they enter the matrix very powerfully and they pass around theplanet on the global energy network. In this way, words spoken at apoint in Scotland can affect someone living in China. That knowledgebecomes available, via the matrix, to the guy living in Peking. Of coursehe won’t stand there accessing every word of the speech, like listeningto the radio. It will be more in the form of an “inspired” thought or asudden questioning of the status quo. If you simply stand and projectthoughts of love, as a group or by yourself, the same effect applies.This is the principle which allows telepathy to happen - the reading ofanother person’s thought fields. You think love in New York, you thinklove to the world. We are all One.The global energy network has a central point, a heart, which pumpsthe energy around the spiritual veins and arteries of the Earth. This is,obviously, the point where you can most effectively change planetaryconsciousness. That heart at the present time is, I believe, in the BritishIsles and the Republic of Ireland. I feel this heart centre will move tothe United States when the new matrix structure switches in. By thenthe US will be a very different place to the one we see today. Thesystem as we know it, the one typified by a culture of massconsumption developed in the United States, will be rapidly collapsing.Within our generation we will reach critical mass, the moment whenthe Earth matrix - the collective mind of humanity - switches fromlimitation to infinity, from fear to love. We are hurtling towards it nowNot only are vastly more minds and hearts opening, energies ofunimaginable power are filtering down from Oneness into this time-space dimension to transform the nature of thought and reality here.These energies and changing human consciousness are affecting globalweather patterns and will, quite probably, lead to unprecedented (inmodern times) geological activity. Vibrational codes are also beingemitted from the Sun to challenge the limitations of the Earthconsciousness. These codes are picked up by the chakras of the Earthand the human body and they are making subtle changes to our thinkingand our DNA, the body’s genetic library and control centre.

I have seen this trend so oftenin the people I meet on speaking tours and at workshops, and in thethousands of letters from around the world. This transformation ofconsciousness knows no boundaries of race, colour, creed, or incomebracket. It recognises no “chosen ones” or “chosen peoples”. It is therefor everyone and everything. All it requires is for us to open our mindsand open our hearts. In other words, to open the door on our mentaland emotional prison, to shatter the eggshell around us, and allow inthe energies that will set us free. That means evacuating the Hassle-Free Zones, letting go of fear, guilt, resentment and judgment, andcelebrating our right, and everyone’s right, to be unique. This is a timeto be joyous. We’re going home. We are returning to multidimensionalOneness and we are being drawn to our vibrational “home” on PlanetEarth. This will involve changes of location, even countries, for manypeople as the eggshell cracks.There is no need to allow the magnitude of it all to stimulate fear orpanic. You are an incredible aspect of multidimensional consciousness.You are capable of anything. People talk about the time of theapocalypse as if it is all death and destruction. But when you take theword apocalypse back to the Greek language from whence it wastranslated, it means something very different: the disclosure, theuncovering, the revealing. That is exactly what is happening now. Whatwe are experiencing and will experience is part of the natural cycle oflearning and evolution. We live forever and we learn forever. There’snothing to fear. A friend of mine, Jack Watters, put it very well whenhe wrote:“Nobody panics when the Sun goes down at night. We know it comesup again in the morning. Nobody panics in the season of falling leaves,we know there’ll be another Spring. If we didn’t know about Springwe’d probably try and superglue the leaves back on the trees. If theyshould be green then better to paint out the russet, copper, and gold ofAutumn.“If we understand a game, we know where it starts and where itfinishes.

Or would we, in the depths of ourmisunderstanding, keep inventing bigger, better glue?” 2And that’s what we have done. Humanity has had such a fear of newexperience, if the experience is at odds with the view of the Hassle-Free Zone, that we have clung to status quos of all kinds as our senseof personal security. We would rather expend massive amounts ofemotion and energy supergluing together these matchstick structures,than allowing them to collapse and using our energy to createsomething better. What’s that we say? Better the devil you know thanthe devil you don’t. Nonsense. If our reality is devils, we will createthem, but we don’t have to. We can create paradise without if we canfind paradise within.So how does all that I have outlined in this chapter affect us now aswe head rapidly into the 21st century?To complete the immense consciousness shift now upon us, we arelooking for balance. Positive-negative balance, male-female balance,physical-spiritual balance. Anything that makes us imbalanced we arebeing challenged to unload. We are attracting to ourselves experienceswhich give us the opportunity to face our imbalances and move throughthem to harmony. This will raise our consciousness, increase it’svibratory rate, and allow us through the “Quantum Gate”, the top ofthat symbolic bottle. Hello everyone, I’m home! The immenseemotional cleansing that is taking place, indeed has been taking placethroughout the 20th century, is potentially catastrophic for everydaylife in the short term - if we continue to believe this movie is “real”. If,however, we see each other as actors playing parts which help us toface ourselves and unload emotional baggage, this period of emotionalcleansing and consciousness rebalancing will be far less traumatic,because we won’t take on yet more guilt and resentment with each newexperience. It’s up to us. We need to remember that we are not ouremotional crap. That is not “us”. We are the eternal vessel that hasbecome filled with emotional crap. We are emptying the vessel andgiving it a polish. Look at it. It’s beautiful.The incredible population increases since the last century are due tothe incarnation of billions of souls arriving to face the experiences in1 Jack Watters, Transformation: The Plan For A Quantum Shift Of Consciousness. Publishedas an information paper in 1996."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"199the three dimensional world, which they hope will clear theiremotional imbalances built up over countless incarnations, and settheir consciousness free to fly through the Quantum Gate. To reachthe vibrational levels necessary to pass through that “gate”, we needto ditch the emotional weights that are vibrationally holding us down.If my own experience and that of so many others is anything to go by,whatever we are attached to emotionally to the point where it becomesa crutch, will be taken away until we let go of that attachment. Peoplewith a crutch walk with a limp and we don’t have time for that. Weneed to run. If you have an emotional attachment to money, if it isyour sense of security, it is likely you will lose it. If you have anemotional attachment to a person to the extent that you are emotionallydependent on them, it is likely you will lose them. And remember it ishigher levels of ourselves that are making this happen, because if ourlower levels don’t shift, the higher levels can’t either. You don’t haveto lose anything or anyone you love so long as you love themunconditionally and without emotional dependency. Be in balance andat peace with yourself. Let go of emotional dependency and you won’tneed to face the experience of losing something or someone becauseyou will already have learned the lessons such an experience isdesigned to offer.The cleansing also includes dealing with each new imbalance as ithappens. This is what you might call instant karma. It is no goodditching the imbalances of centuries and then adding new ones today.It would be like one person emptying the bowl while another continuesto fill it up. So we will find that what we put out comes back to us veryquickly to allow us to constantly face our imbalances and dispersethem. One of the interesting aspects of this dense, separated world isthat the process of cause and effect often happened quite slowly. The“karma” for an action may not have rebounded on that person untilanother incarnation. As the frequency quickens, the period betweencause and effect is getting shorter, until at some point it will literallybe instant. Time itself is getting faster as more people are noticing. Ifwe don’t simplify our lives and take periods to rest, we will be in dangerof burning out. Time as we know it in this three dimensional worldmoves at a certain speed. It is an energy like everything. How fast timeappears to pass depends on how our vibratory rate relates to thevibratory rate of “time”. If you stand still in a 50 mile an hour wind,your hair is blown all over the place. But if you were moving at thesame speed as the wind, all around you would be calm. As the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"200vibrations of this dimension quicken, our relationship to “time” ischanging and one aspect of this is that time appears to pass quicker.This will become more obvious every year. The changes in our relationto “time” will help us synchronise with its natural flow. For instance,our natural cosmic time keepers are cycles of the Moon, not the humanclock. The manipulation and misrepresentation of time has been crucialto the imbalancing of the human psyche and its imprisonmeent in theThird Dimensional reality. The cycle of nature and the cosmos relatesto the 13 cycles of the Moon, each lasting 28 days. These 13 Mooncycles are the natural year. This is the true flow of time and you cansee this in the woman’s 28 day menstrual cycle. But then in 1572 camethe edict by Pope Gregory which introduced the Gregorian calendarwith its illogical year of 12 uneven months based on the Sun (male)and not the Moon (female). This 12 months, 60 minute, 60 secondsystem goes back to the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians and it hasbecome the accepted measurement of “time” throughout the world. Thetrouble is that it is out of sync with natural time, cosmic time, andbecause we have tuned our minds to this Gregorian system we are outof sync with the rhythm of nature. This has delinked us from natureand locked us into the manufactured rhythm of materialism. No wonderwe treat the environment as we do. We are delinked from it. We urgentlyneed to retune ourselves to the 13 Moon, 28 day cycle, especially menwho do not have the menstrual rhythm to help them. As we increaseour vibratory speed during the consciousness shift we will eventuallypass through time as it is measured in the three dimensional world andenter natural time or a sense of timelessness. This is a state that peopleaccess during meditation and other quiet, daydreaming moments whenthe conscious mind is still.Another aspect of the quantum jump is that more people areunlocking their psychic senses. For most people these have been closeddown by fear and the constant ridicule and condemnation of thecenturies by religion and “science” with regard to psychic powers. Thelast thing the manipulators of the Fourth Dimension have desired is forhumanity to be aware, en masse, of our multidimensional potential.Persuading us to switch off our psychic channels was essential to this.Stories of evil spirits, demons and witches were designed to frightenus into denying our ability to communicate with other levels anddimensions. It is true that some very misguided consciousness existson frequencies close to this one, which is why some “channelled”information by psychics is so low grade or manipulating.

But those levels are also being cleansedby the quantum shift and if you can raise your consciousness to beyondthat frequency, you can begin to access knowledge and information thatoffers a far greater insight into the nature of life and what is going onhere. Dammit, we are supposed to communicate with other levels anddimensions. That is our natural state. It is as natural as the Sun and thestars, the air and sky. It was when we closed off those channels that weentered the vibratory prison cell and the movement of populations intovast cities of electromagnetic technology which pollute the Earth’smagnetic energy field has made a connection even more difficult. Eventhen, everyone continues to “channel” information from the Earthmatrix without realising it. Where does our inspired knowledge comefrom that leads us to certain discoveries or inventions? We channel itfrom higher levels. We don’t have to close our eyes and go into “isanybody there?” mode - knock once for yes. We simply access aninspired thought which appears to be our own, but in fact conies froma matrix consciousness or a higher dimension of ourselves. We arepsychic channels whether we know it or whether we don’t. The onlyquestion is: what level of consciousness can our psychic senses access?The more we open our minds and hearts and let go of the emotionalbackpack, the higher that level will be.The consciousness shift will communicate itself in all kinds ofpsychic effects and symbols of change. People will see, hear and senseother levels beyond the physical; we will enjoy vivid dreams from ournightly journeys to other dimensions of consciousness which we willclearly remember and we will sense what is going to happen before itdoes; we will see ever increasing UFO and extraterrestrial activity andamazing crop formations as our dimension merges with theirs. Thevibrational barriers between other dimensions and this one are rapidlydispersing and so much knowledge is pouring into this threedimensional reality through our psychic channels. But, as witheverything, it is important not to accept any information, psychic orotherwise, on face value. Does it feel right and make sense to you?No? Then reject it, whatever the source, and that includes what youread in this book.The re-emergence of the feminine to balance the excesses of themasculine is at the heart of the transformation and the establishment ofbalance. The suppression of the feminine energy has created a malegender, and many females too, who are left brain dominated. That is"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202the part of the brain that manifests the masculine “rational” aspect of us.It is the part that says: “I’ll only believe it when I can see, hear, taste,smell and touch it”. In contrast, the right brain manifests our feminine,intuitive, psychic levels. The right brain represents I Am Me, I Am Free,and the left brain is home to Oh My God. The brain is the computerwhich allows the eternal consciousness to work through a dense physicalbody and so it reflects the domination of the male over the female withinthe lower levels of our eternal self. In the same way, we only use amaximum of 20% of our brains because we are only accessing a fractionof the potential of our multidimensional consciousness. As we use moreof our consciousness, we will use more of our brains, and as we balanceour inner self we will balance the brain between left and right, rationaland intuitive. It is the suppression of our female energy which closed offour psychic channels from their true potential and without the balanceof the female polarity, the male energy has run amok. The return of thefemale, the nurturing, intuitive energy, will bring back into harmony andwholeness the separation caused by the extremes of the male. But itsreplacement with the domination of female over male would be justanother disharmony. It is balance that we are searching for, withinourselves and the world in general. The freeing of the female energy willshow itself in more women in positions of influence and a very differentkind of man. Macho man is going to become a relic of history, a museumpiece. He will be put there by the emerging male-female man: wholeperson man. Without the macho aspect of the male energy (which youalso see in many females), the world created by extreme male energymust crumble because its foundations are disappearing. They are goingto be balanced out of existence. For a while many men may feel lost andwithout a sense of identity as macho man departs, but don’t worry andstick with it. A much better future awaits you as a whole person.Different, yes, but better.The divisions in the world may seem to be growing rather thandiminishing, but this is the healing crisis - the break down of the old sothe new can emerge. The old was created by a thought pattern whichconceded its uniqueness to a herd mentality. As we take our power back,the thought form which held the old world together is disappearing andits physical reflection must therefore disappear as well. A new thoughtpattern is preparing to take over - one that believes in freedom, truefreedom, for all and by all. Its physical reflection will be dramaticallydifferent to what we observe today.

Have you seen the news or read the papers or seen theblank eyes and faces in the street? We have chaos now in thisprogrammed dictatorship that we dare to call “life”. There may well bechaos, or apparently so, in the transition period as the old falls apartand the new begins to emerge. But this is only the natural consequenceof any status quo being replaced very quickly. What will follow in aworld of true freedom will be anything but chaos. The world we seetoday is the creation overwhelmingly of a tiny part of ourmultidimensional consciousness. We try to overcome the suppressionof our psychic and intuitive levels by using phones and filofaxes, andsitting through endless meetings to “organise” things. But this“organisation” is happening on a very shallow level. It relates to theconscious self which is constantly battered by conditioning messagesthrough the eyes and ears. Compared with our multidimensional self,the conscious self isn’t terribly bright. Yet this is the consciousness that“organises” our lives and societies today. Explains a lot, eh?Look at the alternative. When we deprogram ourselves and shatterthe eggshell of conditioned thought, perception, and responses, we flybeyond the delusions of the Earth matrix and reconnect with ourmultidimensional self (Figure 14 overleaf). This gives us access toknowledge and wisdom beyond our imagination and it this multilevelself that will ensure that our lives are not ruled by chaos in theincredible future that awaits us. Already, for those who are open togreater possibilities, these levels speak powerfully to us through ourintuition. The intuition comes to us from levels of consciousnessoutside the limitations of Oh My God. When we flow with our intuition,we move beyond thought and into feeling. We go beyond what weknow as mind - we get out of our heads and into our hearts. Unlike ourthoughts, we can often find it impossible to describe what we feel inmere words. It is a knowingness, a sensitivity from outside the realmsof human language. It is said that as a rule women are more intuitivethan men. This is because women are working with the female energy,the intuitive energy, but as men balance themselves and connect withtheir feminine they, too, have an equal potential for intuition. It is notthe shape of the body, it is the nature of the energy which decides howintuitive we are. This intuition speaks to us in a sort of “knowingness”.It shows itself when we say: “I don’t know why I have to be in Londontomorrow, but I just know I’ve got to be there”.

My intuition, that knowiugness, was urgingme to go and see it live. I checked my schedule of talks and workshopsand it allowed me only one free day to see the show. A friend in Dublinbought the tickets and I arrived in the theatre a few minutes beforethe start to find rny friend looking very bemused and worried. Shesaid she had overheard a security guard say that the “security seats”were in row S, numbers 25, 26, 27, and 28. Now I knew why she wasbemused because she kuew that I had row S, numbers 25 and 26.Security seats? For me? No-one knew that I even had those seats, sowhy the “security”. Somewhat bemused myself by now, I went to theseats with another friend and sat down. Although the rest of the theatrewas packed and the show was about to begin, row S was virtuallyempty. What was going on? At this point, heads were turning to theback of the theatre and I saw someone walk in surrounded by a ringof security “heavies”. A few seconds later I looked down the row tosee Jimmy Carter, the first Trilateral Commission President of theUnited States, walking towards me with his wife. They sat next to mein the other two “security” seats! I couldn’t stop laughing. I hadwritten about Jimmy Carter in The Robots’ Rebellion in the course oFhighlighting how US presidents are merely puppets of the Global Elite.At that time I had just finished ... aud the truth shall set you free inwhich Mr Carter featured once again. And here I was sitting next tohim and his wife in “security” seats, just days after my intuition hadsaid: “Go and see the show in Dublin - now”.

All I am exposing here are the mental andemotional barriers that keep our conscious level from enjoying a naturaland powerful connection with its multidimensional, infinite self. Oncethat connection is made, you no longer need guidance or advice fromthose in the dense physical world. You get all you need from the higherdimensions of yourself - dimensions that operate well beyond thedelusions of the physical. I hear some in the New Age say that you willonly find enlightenment if you do this or do that. I don’t accept thisview for a second. We are all unique, thank goodness. What I need isnot necessarily what you need. We are all on our own path and theonly person who knows what is right for us is... us, the higher, guiding,levels of us.

Who careswhat people may think of you when you first make that transition fromrobot to rebel? It doesn’t matter what they think of you. What mattersis what you think of you. Are you going to let your life be ruled by theviews of the sheep who merely absorb the programmed opinions of theother sheep and accept them as their own? Or are you going to setyourself free and escape from the herd altogether? That is the choicewhich infinity is challenging you to make. For me, the way to achievethis is staring us in the face:Let us respect our own right to be unique and to express thatuniqueness; let us respect the right of others to express theiruniqueness, free from ridicule or condemnation; and let usnever seek to impose what we believe on anyone else. Thatsimple philosophy will transform your life and life on thisplanet.It will bring an end to the mass schizophrenia that underpins theHassle-Free Zones. If we respect our own right to be unique we ceaseto be a slave to imposed thought and behaviour. If we respecteveryone’s right to that same freedom, we cease to be the police forceof the other slaves. With that, the herd and the manipulation of the herdis no more. It is time to remember who we are and where we comefrom. You are not your job and you are not your race. You are not aroad sweeper, an airline pilot or a “housewife”. You are Dot an Arab ora Gentile or a Jew. You are not English or German or Asian. You arenot your religion or your political “ism”. You are not your gender oryour sexual preference. You are not even your thoughts. You are thesilence between them, the silence from which your thoughts are created.You are a unique aspect of evolving consciousness on the threshold ofa dream, a dream you have worked to achieve for so long. Pack yourbag, open your heart, and let’s get out of here.Come on gang. We’re going home."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"208Oh yes, one final thought. What do you really wantto do with your life?
