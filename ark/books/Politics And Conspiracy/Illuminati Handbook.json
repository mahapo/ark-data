Have you seen it before? I'm sure most people haven't. It was first exposed in a book by David Icke called »And the truth shall set you free«. This is the real power structure on planet Earth. It's also the »chain of commands« which is valid today and has been for quite some time now. This whole thing might be unreal to many people, but I ask you to consider it. Most of us can agree on that somethi ng is very wrong with this planet. Civil wars, diseases, famine, ethnic cleansing, religious wars, different violations of human rights ... the list is long and it just goes on. Are all those bad conditions totally separated from each other, or do they have a common source? A ll I ask from you is to think for yourself. Throw away everything »you've been told«, things »you've learnt in school«, what you've »heard on the radio«, what you've »seen on T elevision«, what »politicians have told you« etceteras – just for a moment. Let's start thinking for ourselves for just awhile. It's not too often we do have that opportunity. W e are constantly fed with propa- ganda, bad news, opinions, lies and there are tons of untold secrets. Much of the lies come through the media, which is owned by a few people at the top of the table above. All and everything is to align with those people's intentions and goals. These web pages have a certain purpose. F irst of all I will try to brief you on the current scene, especially the political one, in the world of today. When this is done, I will try to explain what is really happening, not the false data you get when you follow the news on T elevision or in the papers. I will try to comme nt important things we're fed with and explain or debate them. All this based on the facts I'm going to give you soon. Also, these web pages will be currently updated as new data come along.

Illuminati m eans »the enlightened ones« or »bearer of light«, which refers to L u cifer or Satan. Those top players, called the Ill uminati or Moriah, on the International playground belong to the thirteen of the wealthiest families in the world, and they are the men who really rule the world from behind the scene. They are the »Black Nobility«, the Decision Makers, who make up the rules for presidents and governments to follow and they are always withdrawn from public eyes, as their action can't stand scrutiny. Their bloodlines go back thousands of years and they are very careful to keep these bloodlines going from generation to generation without breaking it. Their power lies in the occult and in economy – money creates power . They own all the International banks, the oil-businesses, the most power ful businesses of industry and trade, they infiltrate politics and they own most governments – or at least control them. An example of this is the American election for presidency. It's no secret that the candidate, who gets the most sponsorship in form of money, wins the election, as this gives the power to un-create the opposed candidate. And who sponsors the »right« candidate? The Illuminati does. Sometimes they sponsor both sides to have a game going. They decide who will be the next president, and they see to that their man wins. Most president campaigns are financed with drug money, which is understandable if you know that the Illuminati run the drug trade industry as well. Bill Clinton for example, ha s been trained by them since his youth and was well prepared for his »mission« when he took over Presidency. And what are the goals of the Illuminati? T o create a One W orld Government and a Ne w W orld Order , with them on top to rule the world into slavery and fascism! This is a very old goal, actually, and to understand it fully , one must realize that this goal isn't of a kind that's supposed to be obtained within one lifetime – it has been a goal of the Centuries. This goal has been planned away from official scrutiny, in secrecy within the Secret Societies. All Secret Societies with secret grades of initiation are owned and controlled by the Illuminati, and F reemasonry is maybe the best known. The persons who control the societies and the Illuminati are Satanists and practice Black Magic. Their only God is L ucifer and by occult practices they manipulate and influence the masses. It doesn't matter if you and I believe"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 7 in the stuff or not as long as they do. And they take it very seriously. Some of them are aliens and the others take order from aliens, who are higher up in the hierarchy. It's a thrilling thought, that thi s planet as a matter of fact is run with Black Magic – a pla net where magic is not supposed to exist at all in any shape and form, and if somebody tells you it does, he/she will most certainly be ridiculed. F rom this occult »science«, mind control and Intelligence have developed. By taking over the Movie Industry, the Record companies and b y their control of F ine Art, they know how to influence the teenage rs to dance to their own tune and accept their kind of reality. This makes sense if you look at what kind of »entertainment« we are enforced to enjoy. Where did all the Great Masters go? The music the teenagers have to listen to is often totally without quality and lead them into robotism and apathy, violence and drugs. It's also used for mind control, as we shall see later. Real quality music is rejected by the big record companies in favor for those with lack of talent. Since Black Sabbath in the beginning of the 70:s and the Rolling Stones before them, Satanism has been promoted through the music industry. Many groups followed on the same track and have always been Hard Sales. The same thing goes with Hollywood, which is also controlled and created by the Illuminati. The »E.T\"-movies, Dooms Day films and catastrophe-movies all align with the purpose to influence us in certain directions. Satanic movies have also been well promoted. All to prepare for days to come ... I told you above that the men who control the Illuminati are members of thirteen wealthy famili es. Who they are have been very secret and the leadership has gone from man to man over generations. Nevertheless, no secrecy can be kept forever, and sooner or later there will be leaks, so also in this case. Not many people know who these families are exactly, but quite recently this has become known, due to people from Illuminati, who have left the Order and revealed the most remarkable data. So here are the names of the 13 families – who are set up by aliens to rule this planet behind the certains – the Secret Government.."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! Astor Bundy Collins DuP ont F reeman K ennedy Li Onassis Reynolds Rockefeller Rothschild R ussell V an Duyn [Merovingian] (European Royal F amilies) * Secret societies The Secret Societies have been present in the history of man for a very long time. It all started thousands of years ago with the »Brotherhood of the Snake«, a secret society set up by an alien named Ea or Enki. This story is very carefully told in the Sumerian scriptures, which go back at least 6000 years. There it says man was created by draconian aliens, who came to this planet to exploit its re sources – especially gold. But the work was heavy , so the alien race wanted someone else to do the hard work. Thus Ea, who was a brilliant"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 9 scientist, created homo sapiens as a hybrid between a primitive earth life-form and the alien race. F irst homo sapiens was only meant for slave labor and couldn't breed. Later on this was changed. Ea didn't like, though, how his created race was treated and wanted to enlighten them by telling them who they were and where they came from. He also wanted to tell them the well hidden truth that each indivi dual is a spirit inhabiting a body and that after body death the spirit lives on and reincarnates on Earth. Ea's superiors didn't agree to this, as they were afraid of chaos and turmoil, but Ea told them anyway. The early homo sapiens revolt ed against their Masters, but were forced to retire. Ea then started this secret society, the Brotherhood of the Snake, to enlighten people in secret. But he was discovered and ju dged by the alien laws, which meant that Ea was deported to Earth for eternity – to die here and be reborn here in endless cycles, using fragile, short living human bodies. If this is right, he might still be here ... In the meantime, as time passed by, the »Brotherhood of the Snake« was infiltrated by the Draconian Master aliens and the knowledge was distorted to trap man instead of enlighten him. The Egyptian Era was in fact real »space opera«, with aliens walking around among us, even taking the throne as pharaohs on mostly. By that time the Brotherhood was very infiltrated and i ts purpose to manipulate the masses, making them believe in false gods and masters. In the background through all history there are the secret societies. The original Brotherh ood soon split up in cults, when certain people on top were in disagreement with each other and different powers of control developed, with them even fighting each other (which still is the case today) totally above an ignorant population. They invented the different religions and sects and c ults so man would be busy doing something else instead of looking i nto what the Brother hood was doing. It was also a way to control people by not telling the truth about God and Jesus, so tha t people would miss the point and never be able to be set free. Religion has always been connected with guilt and punishment, which is NO T the way it is supposed to be. They put themselves in charge of the churches to entrap people and to spread"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! conflicts between different belief systems. Most wars throughout history have been religious wars. Out of the original Brotherhood came F reemasonry, the Rosicrucians, The Knight T emplars, Ordo T empli Orientis, Knigh ts of Malta and more. They all knew, on the highest grades, the truth about the origin of man and that we all are spiritual beings and thus immortal. They know God is the REAL and only source, but they distorted that power as we let them deceive us and used the power of God that we have inside of us for their evil purposes. This knowledge is a very well kept secret and they have done everything in their power to hide the truth from people, and one must say they succeeded quite well. P eople who for some reason or another have stumbled upon the road to truth has either been ridiculed, slandered or even killed. Now you might say that the F reemasons, for example, is a charity organization and even Christian to its belief. Y es, that's what we're told and that is what most members of the secret society believe. Most people involved are good people, who are ignorant of what's going on upon the highest grades. Because up there is Satanism and worship of the dark forces. They don't serve God, they serve Satan or L ucifer and that is the key to what is happening in the world of today. Adam W eishaupt (1 748-1811). basically a Jew, converted to become a C atholic Priest and ended up starting a »new« secret society called the Illuminati. Actu ally it was not new at the time; it's been there long before then, but during W eishaupt's lifetime this organization was revealed publically. It's unclear if he was the master-mind behind it, but most researchers, including me, are more or less certain that W eishaupt was just a puppet for the Elite of the F reemasons. The F reemasons had recently started a new branch of F reemasonry – F reemasonry of the Scottish Rite with its 33 degrees of initiation. It's still today one of the most powerful secret societies, including members within high politic s, religious leaders, businessmen and other »useful« persons. Things point in the direction that W e ishaupt was sponsored by the Rothschi lds, who then were (and are) the heads of F reemasonry."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 11 The Illuminati had its own grades ABOVE (or rather beside) the 33 degrees of F reemasonry. Even persons who were initiated to the higher degrees of F reemasonry had no knowledge of the Illuminati grades – it was that secret. Up there W eishaupt planned the take-over of the planet, and he made up distinct targets for a One W orld Government and a New W orld Order. All this was writ ten down in something called the »Protocols of the Elders of Zion«, with an evil purpose to put the blame on the Jews(!) if something would leak. And it did leak! A courier for the Illuminati was struck by lightning when he rode over a field and the Protocols were found, where the takeover was carefully written down. This was in The 1770's. W eishaupt and his Illuminati »Brothers« had to flee and work underground, as their or g anization was banned. It was decided that the name Illuminati should never be used officially again, but front groups should be used to fulfill the purpo se of world domination, with the r est of the population made into slaves. One of the front groups were the F reemasons, who had a better reputation ... It is believed that W eishaupt was killed by his F reemason Brothers, as he was unable to keep his mouth and still continued to use the name Illuminati. There could also have been other reasons. Th e secret goal, however, survived W e ishaupt and the Rothschilds were now h e ads of the Illuminati (and still are today, together with David Rockefeller). A good help to reach the goal came from the F reemason Cecil Rhodes, who in the 19th Century tried to build a One W orld Government with the British Empire on the top. This was of course sponsored by the Rothschilds and it was also Rhodes who created the Round T able, a secret society in itself, named after King Arthur's Round T able, where the Brotherhood Elite are gathering up to this day. W orld W ar I and II were both attempts to take over. After the Second W orld W ar people were so tired of all this killing that they welcomed the United Nations, when it was founded. The official policy of the UN was to safeguard the peace, so nothing like WW II would ever happen again. But indeed the UN was another important front organization for the Illuminati, to unite the countries of the world into one. This led to the EU project, which anyone, with his eyes open, can see goes right into the direction of the biggest fascist"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! state known to man, where each country gets le ss and less power and sovereignty. By galloping inflation the Internatio n al Bankers (read the Illuminati) have succeeded i n making us believe that the only solution is a One Currency – the EMU. When that project is safeguarded, the Central European Bank (Illuminati) has all the power over the economy in Europe and can lead us in whatever direction they want. Some politicians are just stupid and ignorant, others are aware of facts and work for and with the Illuminati. The innocent people, being deceived, are the ones who will suffer the most. This is a betrayal beyond comprehension. The EU then will expand into the United Nations of Africa, Asia and South America and the end phenomenon will be that all those United States will b e united into one big fascist state, which will last in a thousand y ears, regarding to their occult belief. It's the Golden Age – the Age of AntiChrist. The secret societies and the Illuminati believe in the power of symbols. The world is full of their magical and black magic symbols. The problem is, we are so used to seeing them all over the place, that we don't even think about it. The Illuminati believe that the more symbols around, the more magical power to them. The insignia of the Illuminati and the New W o rld Ord e r is the »Pyramid with the All-Seeing- Eye«, which you can study on the back of the US One Dollar Bill(!) A few years ago this symbol was also on a series of stamps coming from the V atican(!) The All-Seeing-Eye is the Eye of Horus, which is the Eye of L ucifer, and goes back to the Egyptian era. Other common symbols are the pentagram (five-pointed star), the hexagram (six-pointed star – The Star of David), the Swastika reveresed (the way Hitler used it) and the pyramid in general. THE SA T ANISTS The secret societies controlled by the Illuminati, have s ecret grades of initiations. W ith F reemasonry you can't just walk in there if you want to be a member – you have to be suggested by at least two persons who are already members, and the person should be examined of his record before he's able to join. If only one person in the council says no to entership, the suggested person will not be permitted. So one can see that they select people carefully to see if he can be of any use to them."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 13 Officially m ost societies are charity organizations, therefore most people join. They are also esoteric with grades of initiations, where every member has sworn loyalty foremost to the Brotherhood, which means if this person has a specific post in society (like a President for example), his first interest is with the Brotherhood and secondly with his post as President. So he has in fact double loyalties. A Brother in good standing should always be protected and cared for, as long as he is useful to the organization and follows its rules. If he flunks or doesn't keep his oaths, he will be made a horrible example of (even killed). It's very important that the secrets are kept. Many F reemasons on the lower grades are actually very pleased to be a member. It's a tight »belonging-feeling« and he will learn a few secrets of this universe, which are not taught in school, and he's often enthusiastic and fascinated. One F reemason said: »Beside my wife, F reemasonry is the most important thing in my life ...« His wife, by the way, must never know anything about what her husband is doing within the society, as it's supposed to be kept secret, and women most often are not allowed into the societies. However there ARE a few societies especially for women. Then one can speculate how come that women are treated as less beings in the community of today, with lower wages for the same job etc. It's a man's world – it's the world of the Secret Societies! W ith the purpose to create a positive front, the Brotherhood is very eager to recruit good beings – hopefully even celebrities – to speak good of them and defend them when necessary. And the less those people know about the real agenda, the more truthful this person will sound in his defense. As time goes on, some of the members (not all though) will enter higher and higher grades within the society, until he reaches the highest ones. But up there, a very careful selection is taken place. Before entering the upper grades a higher Brother demands the apprentice to spit on the cross(!) If the person refuses, due t o his Christian belief, the higher Brother tells him he did the ri ght thing and has showed his loyalty to his religion. But that Brother will never be permitted to enter the highest grades. He will always be met by excuses why he can't continue. On the other hand, if the person spits on the cross, he is showing his loyalty to the Brotherhood instead and is loyal enough to be able to continue up"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! the grade chart.

He will be more and more involved in Black Magic/Satanism and prepared for the »Big secrets«, which are among others the following: 1. The secret society is in communication with alien life-forms, which are the real powers behind the society. 2. The purpose with the society is to create a One W orld Government with them in charge over mankind, but above them in the Hie rarchy is the L uciferian, alien force. 3. The way to control the masses is through mind control and occult, satanic power, used with the intent to manipulate. 4. The reward will be power and money. 5.

Interesting is the fact that L uci's T rust openly declares that a secretive group of illuminated, New Age notables is now running the planet from behind the scene(!)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 15 The reason good intended people stay members of such destructive organizations is probably because of its un-democratic structure and chain of commands. The lower-grade Brother is n ot entitled to know what's on the grade above and curiosity drives him into the mystery. Also, the discipline and secrecy is very strict and punishment can be hard, if one fails to comply. In this manner the very few evil men at the top can control the many innocent and ignorant people below. It's probably that simple and of course a basic form of mind control. I'm not even sure democracy is the ultimate structure of a society, but the hierarchy of a dictatorship must be worse, however. T rue democracy, though, has always showed to fail, as it requires political involvement from the citizens, who are the real power . However, it was Plato (an Illuminati initiate) who came up with democracy in the first place – at least officially, though it was Socrates who initiated the idea. But groups of people have been shown to be easily manipulated and controlled through history, and made to believe they live in a democ racy, when the real power has »invisibly« changed to the favor of the politicians, wh o actually should only be employed by the people for to substantiate their needs and desires. This seems to have been forgotten ... * Th e UN is nothing else but the W o rldpolice of the Illuminati, founded to be able to step in and take military control over a country or region which is countering their plans. Don't think it is a coincidence that the T emple of Understanding is positioned in the UN headquarters ... Socialism is nothing else but the politics the Black Order uses to enslave the people on Earth. The red banner is the symbol of their biggest sponsor and their economical protector's family-banner who since the 1700's has worked for to bring about socialism. The banker Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812) was the first member of this family who worked for and financed it. T oday the Rothschilds own the F-U Central bank, but not many people kno w that many of the European Banks were founded by the Rothschilds and owned by them.

And even more, when the oil resources come to an end, the nuclear power will replace it and therefore the Rothsc hilds have bought 80% of the world assets of Uranium. In this way they will have world control over energy, meaning it will never be free ... So what is the esoteric knowledge taught on the higher grades of the Illuminati? W ell, to the ignorant it might make no sense at all, or at least it will be hard to understand, but I'll try to give you some data anyway, at least for the purpose to inform you. (Click here) THE ANTI- CHRIST As a part of the plan is the uprising of a new Anti- Christ. The rumor is spread that he already is here. His name is the Maitreya Buddha and has been given publicity since the 70's. He is supposed to be the one written about in the Bible and will offi cially come as a »man of peace«, but will show to be a false Messiah and when he has convinced the people of different religions around the world that he is the one they've been waiting for, he will turn to be an oppressive dictator – the Anti- Christ from the Bible. He's been seen together officially with among others the former President of the United States, George Bush. So, are the predictions from the Bible correct? W ell, they might be. P ersonally, I'm not convinced Maitreya is the right one. (Please click here to read more about Maitreya. Be sure to follow all the links ...!) THE BILDERBERGERS One of the most powerful front groups of the Illuminati, which also works as a secret society in itself, is the Bilderberg group.

These two persons decided meetings on a regular basis for the European foreign-ministers. Their first meeting occurred in Hôtel Bilderberg in the Dutch Oosterbreck between the 29-31 of May 1954, thus the name of the group. The core of the group consists of an Elite of people, counted to 39, called the Steering Committee. They are not elected and was originally led by Prince Bernhard, a close friend to the British Crown. Since 1954, meetings have been arranged at least once a year on different locations every time – very secret. The members are around 120 persons from the high fina nce circles of W e stern Europe, the USA and Canada. Although the meetings are very hidden and nothing leaks to the international media (which is natural, as most of the Media Moguls are Bilderbergers. So much for free press), the independent news-magazine »Spotlight« has been able to report from the meetings somehow. Invited are also political leaders from different countries. Their flight-tickets are paid by the Committee, and there is free food and drinks etc. The purpose of the group is a W o rld Government by the year 2012 and a global army through the UN. The take-over is partly planned to involve computers. Bill Gates, con nected with the Illuminati and the Director of Microsoft, has a satanic lodge inside the huge Microsoft building. Thus the computer break - down by the year 2000 is not an accident, but well planned. In the chaos that will fo llow, the Illuminati will take advantage of the situation and put in a »stable datum« in the chaos, and as the only calm unit in the confusion they will try for a take-over. The group is also called the »invisible world government«. Because of the character of the meetings it's clearly bribery on the behalf of the politicians who are taking part. Here they are suggested to betray their own countries by selling out their sovereign states to the EU by deceiving their own people..

This commission consists of the industrial and commercial giants of the »trilateral nations«; the USA, Japan and W estern Europe. They are all members of the Elite, coming from different branches of F reemasonry world-wide for to give the Bilderbergers a broader political basis. The 200 members are permanent and in this case different from the Bilderbergers, who are invited, except for the Steering Committee. The T rilateral Commission controls through the CFR members the whole U .S. economy, politics, military, oil, energy and media lobbies. The members are chairmen of different companies, bankers, real estate agents, economists, scientists, lawyers, publishers, politicians, union leaders, presidents of F oundations and newspaper columnists. THE CO UNCIL ON FOREIGN RELA TIONS (CFR) This semi-secret organization was established in 1921 and the members of this secret society are exclusively Am ericans and. T oday the CFR holds a tig h t control over the countries of the W estern W orld, with help from Canadians sister-organizations and its mother-org anization in Britain, the »Royal Institute of International Affairs« (RIIA) with Queen Elisabeth II at the top. The CFR is in its turn controlled by the Rockefellers and also works for a Global Government. Its inner core is the dark Order of Skull & Bones, where George Bush is a member. THE COMMITTEE OF 300 This is a very old secret society, founded in 1729 by the Black Nobility through the British East India Company to deal with international banking and trade problems and to support the opium trade. It is run by the British Crown(!). It comprises the whole world banking system and the most important representatives of W estern nations. Through the Committee of 300 all banks are linked to Rothschild. The Committee is of course a part of the Illuminati.

F or example, JFK's ritual sacrifice was performed in Dallas, because that city is close to the N . 33 parallel: the 33rd degree is the highest publicly known degree of the Scottish Rite of Masonry. In a similar fashion, JFK, Jr ., was killed and committed to the waters of the Atlantic close to the intersection of the N . 41 parallel and W . 71 meridian; summing up, 4 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 13, the most Masonically correct number. This intersection, southwest of Martha's V ineyard, is also close to the small island called No Mans Land. »No Mans« is a Baconian cypher for »Mason«, i.e., Mason Land. JFK, Jr ., and his public wife, Carolyn Bessette, were married on Cumberland Island, off the coast of Georgia. This island is close to the intersection of the N . 31 parallel and the W . 81 meridian; again, 3 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 13. Another important Conspiratorial spot nearby is Jekyll Island, GA. It was there that clandestine L uciferian Masonic (CL uM) Conspirators met to organize the Racketeer -Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) known as the F ederal Reserve System."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 25 These two geographical intersections are part of a line of similar intersections along the eastern seaboard, whose numbers add up to 13. >F rom south to north, these intersections are: *** N . 31 parallel and W . 81 meridian, just mentioned. Off the coast of Georgia, close to the Florida border. *** N . 32 parallel and W . 80 meridian; 3 + 2 + 8 + 0 = 13. Off the coast of South Carolina, close to Charleston. Charleston is the seat of the Mother Council of the Masonic Scottish Rite for the whole world. The names of the Carolinas and Charleston are reminders of King Charles I of England, another CL uM sacrificial victim, decapitated by CL uM Brother Oliver Cromwell in 1649. L uciferian Masons are fascinated by decapitations and skulls: their predecessors, the Knights T emplars, worshipped the Baphomet, a mysterious skull. The Y ale-based Masonic-type secret society Skull and Bones keeps the skulls of Mexican and Native American revolutionaries in the T omb, its on-campus headquarters in New Haven, CT Similarly, the Masonic-type German secret society Thule initiated Adolf Hitler in its ranks and he later organized the SS. The SS followed Masonic-type secret rituals and their emblem was the Skull and Bones, just like CL uM Brother George W . Bush's fraternity. F arther north there are more »13\" intersections: *** N . 40 parallel and W . 72 meridian, off the south coast of Long Island, NY , not too far from where TW A 800 was deep-sixed by the CL uMs on July 17, 1996.

CL uMs are great advocates of so - domy, since the Antichrist himself is of a dubious nature. The androgynous nature of the Antichrist is symbolized by the two interlocking triangles of the occult hexagram known as the Star of David, or Seal of Solomon, a prominent Masonic emblem. Again, 4 + 2 + 7 + 0 = 13. By connecting these intersections on a map, one draws a line stretching from the Atlantic coastal border of Florida and Georgia to the coastal border of Maine with the Canadian province of New Brunswick. This »13\" line, therefore, encompasses the 13 original colonies and, later, states of New Atlantis, a.k.a. the U .S.A. (Back then, Maine was part of the territo - ry of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.) What a CL uM »coincidence«! Examining this »13\" – Line, one sees that it passes near Kitty Hawk, NC, the site of the W right brothers' first flight. Later on, in 1932, the world-famous aviator, Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, searched for his kidnapped baby son along this »13\" – Line southwest of Martha's V iney- ard, close to No Mans Land (Mason Land). As CL uM luck would have it, the Lindbergh family's original name back in Sweden was Mansson, another Baconian cypher for »No Mans«. There is good reason to believe that the real grandfather of Col. Lind- bergh was the Crown Prince of Sweden and later King Charles XV . Members of the Swedish royal family are prominent patrons of Masonry and the royal family itself is associated with the so -called L uciferian bloodline connected to the »Priory of Zion«."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 27 Therefore, it seems that the Lindbergh baby, a likely L uciferian descendant, was offered as a »thanksgiving« sacrifice to L ucifer/Satan for the aviation successes of the W right brothers and his father, Charley Mansson, a.k.a. Col. Charles A. Lindbergh. As CL uM luck would have it, the L uciferian FBI announced last Thursday, July 22, that it was finally releasing its files on the Lindbergh kidnapping to the National Archives. That was on the exact same day as the JFK, Jr ., burial at sea close to the »13\" – Line. It seems that JFK, Jr ., and the two women were also sacrificed to L ucifer/Satan to thank him for the CL uM success of sending men to the moon exactly 30 years ago. The Apollo program itself was kicked off with the ritual sacrifice of President K ennedy in Dallas along the N . 33 parallel. As it has been revealed recently, President K ennedy's original casket was also deep-sixed in the waters of the Atlantic, off the coastal border of Delaware and Maryland, close to this »13\" – Line along the eastern seaboard of New Atlantis. A small part of the President's brain, exami- ned at the autopsy, has been missing for years. It may be that that part of the brain has also been committed to these same waters of the Atlantic, the burial grounds of the legendary »utopia« of Atlantis. Last, but certainly not least, this »13\" – Line passes within less than five miles from the Hyannis P ort compound of the CL uM K ennedy family.

I follow new U .S. stamp issues and was surprised, as most knowledgeable people were, that the latest increase (in January 1999) was just one penny, from 32 to 33 cents. According to the United States P ostal Service (USPS), this increase does not fully cover the increased costs of their operations. In the past most increases have been two or three pennies at a time. Somehow, the USPS decided to inaugurate a 33-cent rate in January, the first month of 1999, a year when the Antichrist celebrated his 33rd birthday on June 6, according to my investigations. In addition, the temporary stamp for the 33-rate is an »H« stamp. Does the »H« stand for »Hiram«, or »Horus«, or »Hell«, or all three. Who knows? Only the higher-ranking CL uMs do. The »letter-denomination« stamps were started back in the 1970s, with the first one, the »A« stamp coming on in 1978 for the 15-cent rate. One can detect a long-winded plan to arrive at the 33-cent rate and the »H« stamp this year, along with football's Superbowl XXXIII, played again in January 1999, on the day of the first Blue Moon of this two-blue-moon year. The »H«, or »Hiram«, or »Horus«, or »Hell« stamp is Masonically correct, colored in red, white, and blue, decorated with three, count them, three pentacles.

While we are searching for guidance and explanations, they will establish one global government. This go - vernment will serve the interests of a selected few and turn the rest of us into their slaves. Hard to believe? Lets take a look at the evidence.

If the government wanted the base to be kept a secret, it would be a secret. W e would know a little about it but we certainly wouldn't have dozens of pictures. Another thing the global governments used to make us believe in UFO's is having Spain declassi- fy its files on UFO's. This is one of the final attempts to make us believe in Aliens. This shows that the NWO is drawing near. If they want us to believe in UFO's, why don't they just tell us? It's human nature to fear what we don't know. P eople would be a lot less frightened of UFO's if they knew the govern- ment knew they were here. Who's in charge of the New W orld Order? The people who are already in charge of us.

Karl Marx was openly an Illuminatist (The Illuminati were a lot less secret back in his time). How do we know the Illuminati are still around? W ell every year there is a meeting between some of the most powerful people on the planet. This group is called the Bilderberg . The purpose of these meetings is kept a total secret. Why would the worlds most powerful people be meeting secretly? They don't want their plans, as the heads of the Illuminati, to be exposed. All these people have loads of money to help each others cau- ses. W ith these powerful peoples' causes well funded, it would be very easy for them to take over.

I'm sure you have heard one time or another about the US's holographic program started by the Air F orce after Desert Storm. They classified it as a »non-lethal weapon.« W ith these holographs they can make life like illusions of tanks, troops, an angry God, and even UFO's. Mysteriously, in 1994 the government suddenly stop - ped talking about the program. Don't let that fool you they are still working on it and more openly then you think. Right now in a remote area of Alaska, the US government is study- ing the ionosphere(layer of the atmosphere that is made up of gas and charged particles). They call this project HAARP (High frequency Active Auroral Research Program). They purpose of HAARP is to study the way the ionosphere effects radio signals. What the government forgot to tell you was that they are studying the ionosphere to use holographs. The ionosphere reflects most frequencies. This includes the frequency to project holographs. In order to project images, the Illuminati would need millions of mirrors and most of them in the sky. This would be nearly impossible so that is why they are studying the io - nosphere. Since it will reflect the frequencies of the holographs, they can use it as a giant mirror.

The offi- cials of Charlotte were furious at the government for lying to them and terri- fying the city's population. »How they thought they could come in and out without any disturbance is beyond me,« P at McCrory (mayor of Charlotte) said.

P ete P ierce recently said in an interview with National P ublic Radio, »W e are going to continue urban training.« Why would the government be training it's forces to terrify people in large urban areas? Are there any countries that are having a confrontation with the US that has cities similar to Charlotte or any of the other cities that these drills have been in? Of coarse not, so that leaves only one other answer, the government is training its forces to attack its own people. Even though no human has been harmed Physically by these black helicopters they have been abused mentally. On May 7, 1994, in Harrahan, Loui- siana, an unmarked black helicopter chased a teenager for 45 minutes. When the teen reported what happened, the officer was informed that the helicopter was owned by the US government and it was not in his power to do anything. F un- ny how the helicopter had no markings and it's US law that all vehicles of the air force have the US written on them. In 1995 a black, unidentified helicopter sprayed an unknown substance on a farm in F allon, Nevada. The next day the owners of the farm woke up and saw a horrifying image. Where the helicopter sprayed their farm there were 13 dead cattle. six months later, the plants in the area died.

The helicopter that sprayed the farm was identical to the one in Louisiana which the government admitted to owning. Still don't believe? The UN and the US military are planning to vaccina- te 2.5 million troops for the deadly biological agent, Anthrax. It is nearly impossible to detect Anthrax and it kills its victims very quickly. P erhaps the same substance that was sprayed on the farm? These helicopters conti- nue to terrify citizens by spraying these unknown chemicals in both rural and urban areas. These chemicals have killed numerous pets, plants, and livestock. Even though some of these black helicopters are owned by the F ederal emer - gency Management Agency and the Drug Enforcement Agency, a majority of the helicopters' origin is completely a mystery. One of the most common question I get is, »When is the New W orld Order going to take effect?«. I hate to tell people this but the New W orld Order will take effect most likely on May 1, 1998. I am not certain of this, however a lot of my research concludes that this is the date. 1998 is the year of the triple 666(number of the beast). On this date the Illuminati organization will be 222 years old, 2+2+2=6 (6 by itself is the number that represents evil). 1998 is the 30th anniversary of the JFK assassination (His assassination was plan- ned by Illuminatists to keep their plans under wraps).

It's a d e clarative statement. WHO , the W orld Health Organization, murdered Africa with the AIDS viru s. Thats a provocative statement, isn't it? The answers to this little mystery, Murder on the WHO Express will be quite clear to you by the end of this report. Y ou will also understand why the other suspects, the homosexuals, the green monkey and the Haitians, were only pawns in this virocidal attack on the non-Communist world. If you believe the government propaganda that AIDS is hard to catch then you are going to die even sooner than the rest of us. The common cold is a virus. Have you ever had a cold? How did you catch it? Y ou don't really know, do you? If the cold virus was fatal, How many people would be left in the world? Y ellow fever is a virus. Y ou catch it from mosquito bites. Malaria is a parasite also carried by mosquitoes. It is many times larger than the AIDS virus ( like comparing a pinhead to a moose head ) yet the mosquito easily carries this large organism to man. The tuberculosis germ, also larger than that AIDS virus, can be transmitted by formites ( inanimate objects such as towels ). The AIDS virus can live for as long as 10 days on a dry plate. Y ou can't understand this murder mystery unless you learn a little virology. Many viruses grow in animals and many grow in humans, but most of the viruses that affect animals don't affect humans. There are exceptions, of course, such as yellow fever and small pox. There are some viruses in animals that can cause very lethal cancer in those animals, but do not affect man or other animals. The Bovine Leukemia V irus ( BL V ), for example, is lethal to cows but not humans. There is also another virus that occurs in sheep called Sheep V isna V irus whi ch is also non-reactive in man. These Deadly viruses are »"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! Retro -V iruses », meaning that they ca n change the genetic composition of the cells that they enter. The W orld Health Organization, in pub lished articles, called for scientists to work these deadly agents and attempt to make a hybrid virus that would be deadly to humans. » An attempt should be made to see if viruses can in fact exert selective effects on immune funct ion. The possibility should be looked into that the immune response to the virus itself maybe impaired if the infecting virus damages, more or less selectively, the cell responding to the virus.« Thats AIDS. What the WHO is saying in plain english is » Let's cook up a virus that selectively destroys the T -Cell system of man, an acquired immune defici ency. Why would anyone want to do this? If you destroy the T - Cell system of man then you destroy man. Is it even remotely possible that the WHO would want to develop a virus that would wipe out the human race? If there new creation worked, the WHO stated, then many terrible and fatal infe ctious viruses could be made even more terrible and more malignant. Does this strike you as being a peculiar goal for a health organization? Sometimes Americans believe in conspiracies and sometimes the don't. W a s there a co nspiracy to kill President K e nnedy? T wenty five years later the debate still continues, and people keep changing there minds. One day it's yes and the next it's no – depending upon what was served for lunch, or how the stock market did the day before. But it doesn't take a bad lunch to see an amazing concatenation of events involving R ussian and Chinesse communist nationals, The WHO , The National Cancer Institute, and the AIDS epidemic. But what about the green monkey? Some of the best virologist in the world and many of those directly involved in AIDS research, such as Robert Gallo and L uc Montagnier, have said that the green monkey may be the culprit. Y ou know the story: A green monkey bit a native on the ass and, bam – AIDS all over central Africa."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 83 There is a fatal flaw here. It is very strange. Because Gallo, Montagnier and these other virologist know that the AIDS virus doesn't occur naturally in monkeys. In fact it doesn't occur naturally in any animal. AIDS started practically simultaneously in the United States, Haiti, Brazil, and Central A frica. ( W a s the green monkey a jet pilot? ) Examination for the gene structure of the green monkey cells prove that it is not genetically possible to transfer the AIDS virus from monkeys to man by natural means. Because of the arti ficial nature of the AIDS virus it will not easily transfer from man to man unless it has become very concentrated in the body fluids through repeated injections from person to person, such as drug addicts, and through high multiple partner sexual activity such as takes place in Africa and among homosexuals. After repeated transfer it can become a » natural » infection for man, which it has. Dr . Theodore Strecker's research of the literature indicates that the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) in collaboration with the WHO , made the AIDS virus in there laboratories at F ort Detrick ( now NCI ). They combined the deadly ret ro-viruses Bovine-Leukemia V i rus and Sheep V isna V irus, and injected them into human tissue cultures. The result was the AIDS virus, the first human retro-virus known to man and now believed to be 100% fatal to those infected. The momentous plague that we now face was anticipated by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1974 when they recommended that »Scientists throughout the world join with the members of this committee in voluntarily deferring experiments linking animal viruses«. What the NAS is saying in carefully guarded english is: »F or God's sake. Stop this madness!« The green monkey is off the hook. How about the Communists? Communist are in the process of conducting germ warfare from F ort Detrick, Maryland against the free world, expecially the United States, even using foreign communist agents within the US Army's germ warfare unit euphamistically called the Army Infectious Disease Unit. Y ou don't believe it? Carlton Gajdusek, an NIH bigshot at Detrick admits it. » IN THE F ACILITY I HA VE A BUILDING WHERE MORE GOOD AND L O Y AL COMMUNIST SCIENTISTS FROM THE USSR AND MAINLAND CHINA WORK, WITH FULL P ASSKEYS T O ALL THE LABORA T ORIES, THAN"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! THERE ARE AMERICAN. EVEN THE ARMY'S INFECTIOUS DISEASE UNIT IS L OADED WITH FOREIGN WORKERS NO T AL W A YS FRIENDL Y NA - TIONALS.« Can you imagine that? A UN- WHO communist trogan horse in our biological warfare center with the full blessing of the US government? The creation of the AIDS virus by the WHO was not just a diabolical scientific exercise that got out of hand. It was a cold-blooded successful attempt to create a killer virus which was then used in a successful experiment in Africa. So successful in fact that most of Central Africa may be wiped out, 75,000,000 dead within 3-5 years. It was not an accident, it was deliberate. In the F ederation Proceedings of the United States in 1972, WHO said : » In relation to the immune response a number of useful experimental ap proaches can be visualized ». They suggested a neat way to do this would be to put their new killer virus ( AIDS ) into a vaccination program, sit back and observe the results. » This would be particularly informative in sibships,« they said. That is, give AIDS to brothers and sisters and see if they die, who dies first, and of what, just like rats in a laboratory. They used the smallpox vaccine for their vehicle and the geographical sites chosen in 1972 were Ugunda and other African sites, Haiti, Brazil and Japan. The prese n t and recent past of AIDS epidemiology coincides with these geographical areas. Dr . Strecker points out that even if the African green monkey could transmit AIDS to humans, the pre sent known amount of infection in Africa makes it statistically impossible for a single episode, such as a monkey biting someone, to have brought this epidemic to this point. The doubling time of the number of people infected, about every 14 months, when correlated with the first known cases, and the present known number of cases, prove beyond a doubt that a large number of people had to be infected at the same time. Starting in 1972 with the fi rst case from our mythical monkey, and doubling the number of infected from that single source every 14 months you get only a few thousand cases. F r om 1972 to 1987 is 15 years or 180 months. If it takes 14 months to double the number of cases then there would have been"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 85 13 doublings. 1 then 2 then 4 then 8.. etc...In 15 years, from a single source of infection there would be about 8000 cases in Africa, not 75 million. W e are approaching W orld W ar II mortality statistics here – without a shot being fired. Dr . Theodore A. Strecker is the courageous doctor who has unraveled this conundrum, the greatest murder mystery of all time. He should get the Nobel Prize but he'll be lucky not to get »suicided.« ( »Prominent California doctor ties his hands behind his back, hangs himself, and jumps from 20th floor. There was no evidence of foul play .« ) Strecker was employed as a consultant to work on a health proposal for Security P acific Bank. He was to estimate the cost of their health care for the future. Should they form an HMO was the major issue. After investigating the current medical market he advised against the HMO because he found that the AIDS epidemic in all probability bankrupt the nation's medical system. He became fascinated with all the scientific anomalies concerning AIDS that kept cropping up. Why did the » experts » keep talking about green monkeys and homosexuals being the culprits when it was obvious that the AIDS virus was a man-made virus? Why did they say it was a homosexual and drug-user disease when in Africa it was obviously a heterosexual disease? If the green monkey did it then why did AIDS explode practically simultaneously in Africa, Haiti, Brazil, Japan, and the United States? Why, when it was proposed to the National Institute of Health that the AIDS virus was a combination of two bovine or sheep viruses cultured in human cells in a laboratory, did they say it was » bad science » when thats exactly what occurred? As early as 1970 the WHO was growing these deadly animal viruses in human tissue cultures. Cedric Mims, in 1981, said in a published article that there was a bovive virus contaminating the culture media of th WHO . W as this an accident or a »non-accident«? If it was an accident then why did the WHO continue to use the vaccine? This viral and genetic death bomb, AIDS, was finally produced in 1974. It was given to monkeys and they died of pneumocystis carni which is typical of AIDS. Dr . R. J . Biggar said in Lancet ( a Brittish journal ) that the AIDS agent could not have developed de novo. That means in plain english that it didn't come"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! out of thin air. AIDS was engineered in a laboratory by virologists. It couldn't engineer itself. As Dr . Stricker so colorfully puts it: » If a person has no arms or legs and shows up at a party in a tuxedo, how did he get dressed? Somebody dressed him. » There are 9000 to the 4th power possible AIDS viruses. ( There are 9000 base pairs on the geneome. ) So the fun has just begun. Some will cause brain rot similar to the sheep virus, so me leukemia-like diseases from the cow viruses, and some that won't do anything. So the virus will be constantly changing and trying out new esoteric disease on hapless man. W e 're only the beginning Because of the trillions of possible genetic combinations there will never be a vaccine. Even if they could develop a vaccine they would un-doubtfully give us something equally as bad as they did with the P olio vaccine ( cancer of the brain ), the Swine Flu vacc ine ( a P olio - like disease ), the Smallpox vaccine (AIDS), and the Hepatitis vaccine (AIDS). There are precedents. This is not the first time the virologists have brought us disaster. SV -40 virus from monkey cell cultures contaminated P olio cultures. Most people in there 40's are now carrying the virus through contaminated P olio innoculations given in the early 60's. It is known to cause brain cancer which expl ains the increase in this disease that we have seen in the past 10 years. This is the origin of the green monkey theory. The P olio vaccine was grown on green monkey kidney cells. 64 million Americans were vaccinated with SV -40 contaminated vaccine in the 60's. An increase in cancer of the brain, possibly Multiple Sclerosis, and God only knows what else is the tragic result. The delay between vaccination and the onset of cancer with this virus is as long as 20-30 years. 1965 + 20 = 1985. Get the picture? The final piece of the puzzle is how AIDS devastated the homosexual population in the United States. It wasn't from Smalpox vaccination as in Africa because we don't do that any more. There is no Smallpox in the United States and so vaccination was discontinued. Although some AIDS has been brought to the United States from Haiti by homosexuals, It would not be"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 87 enough to explain the explosion of AIDS that occurred simultaneously with the African and Haitian epidemics. The AIDS virus didn't exist in the United States before 1978. Y ou can check back in any hospital and no stored blood samples can be found anywhere that exhib it the AIDS virus before that date. What happened in 1978 and beyond to cause AIDS to burst upon the scene and devastate the homosexual section of our population? It was the introduction of the Hepatitis B vaccine which exhibits the exact same epidemiology of AIDS. A Doctor W . Schmunger, born in P oland and educated in R ussia, came to this country in 1969. Schmunger's immigration to the U .S. was probably the most fatefull immigration in our history. He, by un-explained process, became the head of one of the New Y ork City blood bank. ( How does a R ussian trained doctor become the head of one of the largest blood banks in the world? Doesn't that strike you as peculiar? ) He set up the rules for the Hepatitis vaccine studies. Only males between the ages of 20 and 40, who were not monogamous, wer e allowed to participat e in this study. Can you think of any reason for insisting that all expermentees be promiscuous? Maybe you don't believe in the Communist conspiracy theory but give me some other logical explanation. Schmunger is now dead and his diabolical secret went with him. The Centers for Disease Control reported in 1981 that 4% of those receiving the Hepatitis vaccine were AIDS infected. In 1984 they admitted to 60%. Now they refuse to give out the figures at all because they don't want to admit that 100% of the Hepatitis vaccine receivers are AIDS infected. Where is the data on the Hepatitis vaccine s tudied? FDA? CDC? No, the U . S. Department of Justice has buried it where you will never see it.

Dr . O . W . Judd, International Agency for Research on Cancer, the agency that requested the production of the virus in the first place, is also a veterinari- an. The Leukemia research he is conducting is being done under the auspices of a school of veterinary medicine. Now, there is nothing wrong with being a vet but, as we have pointed out, the AIDS virus is a human virus. Y ou can't test the se viruses in animals and you can't test leukemias in them either. It doesn't work. So why would your government give Judd, a veterinarian, 8.5 million dollars to study leukemia in a veterinary college? As long as we are being used as experimental animals maybe it is appropriate. The London T imes should be congratulated for uncovering the smallpox- AIDS connection. But there expose was very misleading. The article states that the African AIDS epidemic was caused by the smallpox vaccine »triggering« the AIDS in those vaccinated. Dr . Robert Gallo, who has been mix ed up in some very s t range scientific snafus, supports this theory. Whether the infection of 75 million Africians was deliberate or accidental can be debated, but there is no room for debate whether the smallpox shots »awakened the unsuspecting virus infection.« There is absolutely no scientific evidence that this laborat ory-engineered virus was present in Africa before the WHO descended upon these hapless people in 1967 with their deadly AIDS -laced vaccine. The AIDS virus didn't come from Africa, it came from F ort Detrick, Maryland, U .S.A. The situation is extremely desperate and the medical profession is too frightened and cowed (as usual) to take any action. Dr . Strecker attempted to mobilize the doctors through some of the most respected medical journals in the world. The prestigious Annals of Internal Medicine said that his material »appears to be entirely concerned with maters of virology« and so try some other publication."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 89 In his letter to The Annals, Strecker said, »If correct human experimental procedures had been followed we would not find half of the world stumbling off on the wrong path to the cure for AIDS with the other half of the world covering up the origination of the dammed disease. It appears to me that your Annals of Internal Medicine is participating in the greatest fraud ever perpetrated.« I guess they didn't like that so Stricker submitted his sensational and mind- boggling letter with all of the proper documentation to the British journal, Lancet. Their reply : » Thank you for that interesting letter on AIDS. I am sorry to have to report that we will not be able to publish it. W e have no criticism« but their letter section was » over crowded with submissions ». They're too crowded to announce the end of western civilization and possibly all mandkind? Doesn't seem reasonable. What can we do? The first thing that should be done is to close down all laboratories in this country that are dealing with these deadly retro-viruses. Then we must sort out the insane, irresponsible and traitorous scientists involved in these experiments and try them for murder. Then maybe, just,maybe, we can re -populate and re -civilize the world. W illiam Campbell Douglass, M.D . P .O .

Let me fill in you in on how and why MI6 were able to terminate Diana, why they should want to etc. Diana has always been a worry to the British Royal family. She was selected by Buckingham P alace, to be little more than the 'surrogate mother' to Prince Charles' role as constitutional 'stud'. Although she undoubtedly cared for Chalres, maybe even loved him, she knew at her marriage that Charles' affections to her were eclipsed by his affections for Camillia P arker -Bowles, of a minor aristocratic family. Camillia is two years older than Charles and would have been in her late thirties at the time Char - les married Diana. Although, she was no commoner, Camilla was bodily- clock did not have the ample mileage left that Diana's did. A marriage was forced between Charles, a man selfishly pre-possessed with becoming King and providing heirs, and Diana, a young bedazzled girl caught in the web of one of the most devious women in Britain – The Queen. Charles was always far more unpopular with the British people than Diana and he resented this, resented it a lot. Charles was the important one, it was he who was to head the British State, and yet this shy,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 111 inarticulate girl was beguiling to to the British people and later the world. F rom the start of the marriage, Diana knew that she would have to 'make' Charles love her , she knew he didn't already. She knew he still loved Camillia. 'There were always three of us in our marriage', she said on BBC's P anorama. But throughout this unhappy time, she'd managed to do her job - she'd provided two healthy boys, she's provided heirs. Although the Queen's plan had been an immense success, she couldn't help but be horribly cruel towards Diana. The Princess of W ales was not given ladies in waiting – she was a pseudo -Royal in the eyes of the Queen. This took it's toll on Diana. She descended into bouts of bulimia, beca- me psychologically scarred. Y et, even in her frailty she was being a pain in the arse to the Queen and Charles. She was as popular as ever. While Charles played the grouse-shooting Aristocrat and was alienating the British peo - ple from the Monarchy, Diana was transcending such matters and was de - veloping herself into a formidable force.

Y et, Charles, the envious little creature that he is could not take pleasure in the asset of Diana. She outshone him and he hated it.

This she found for a time with Capt. James Hewitt. Y et sensing that Diana had given her first two-fingers to the House of W insor, she was in for trouble. Not only now a target of the Queen, she was now a target of Britain's domestic intelligence agency – MI6. Behind closed doors, the establishment of Aristocratic Elites and related Conservative politicians decided to launch a campaign to discredit her in the eyes of Britain. The unaccountable, secretive and often down-right evil MI5 were called in to monitor Dia- na, tap-her phones, dig the dirt. This they did, and their greatest triumph came with the 'Squidgy' tapes (intimate calls between Diana and Hewitt) which were leaked into the press by M15. Y et, British opinion was not as conservative as the growing conspiracy had thought. P eople were not too bothered, they saw Diana as a victim, they excused the affair, they were more angry that someone had tapped the woman's phone. The estab - lishment plot was failing. The British Monarchy was looking bad, the future King was looking bad, the whole British constitutional system was slowly being viewed with resentment by a larger portion of the population than ever before. Y et through all this Diana was shining, bringing a fairy-tale magic in fleeting moments to AIDs victims, the homeless, the war torn. If the British establishment was showing worrying subsidence cracks, the mythologi- cal fairy-tale Diana was certainly not. Although often emotionally fragile, Diana had shifted from the plain but pretty, slight gormless young girl into someone, now bolstered by a powerful network of friends and colleagues she was now playing the Queen at her own game. She was getting her own back, fighting deviousness with"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 113 deviousness, through her band of advisors she was making Charles look more and more the bad guy. T owards her divorce and after she was orche - strating the media to present her as the more favourable of the two. While she had stated as a constitutional liability, Diana was now actively attacking the constitutional elite. She was threatening to destroy the horrible British constitutional system which had done her so much harm and treating her as merely a slab of meat, an incubator of heirs, a stooge of the House of W indsor . But not only was Diana now seen to be attacking the public State, she was now doing something far, far more dangerous – she was at- tacking the most evil sector of the Private State – the Arms industry. Diana was speaking out against land-mines and calling for a total worldwide ban on their manufacture and sale. This was at a time when the Private state was doing a pretty good job of smothering centrist and left- of-centre calls within the New Labour party for a ban. Here was Diana, stirring it all up, jet-setting around the world, mingled with more ethical leaders, got good support. She was even able to get Hillary to make Bill reconsider his position on the issue. W orld-wide Diana was quietly making many ene - mies. Her actions were particularly upsetting to the Arms Barons in Britain, where lower-tech weaponry such as landmines is a big industrial deal. And of course, Arms Exporters are monitored and aided by secret security ser - vices, occasionally in 'legitimate intelligence gathering', most often in the protection of W estern puppet-dictatorships, which provide markets for killing machines and provide an excuse for W estern Armed F orces to stay"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! tooled-up. Diana had been the target of intelligence attacks before at the hands of Britain's bumbling MI5, now she was to be targeted on a much higher level – she was to cross the path of the world-wide secret government where intelligence agencies, big corporations, Royal Houses, powerful indivi- duals, neo -Chivalraic Orders, and powerful secret societies merge into a blur. The British wing was to act on both worldwide and domestic concerns through the infamous MI6. Y et Diana was not alone in getting up the nose of the British system. Another man was up to the same thing – Muhammad Al-F ayed. Al-F ayed is the controller of a huge business network and, like most self-made billionaires, had the attitude 'W ell, I've made it! Up yours!'. The darling of the Margaret Thatcher , Al-F ayed epitomised the right-libertarian philosophy – do what you you like and tread on as many toes as you like in the pursuit of wealth. This type of attitude leads to an ethical vacuum, nothing is a barrier to making money. Al-F ayed was soon slipping bungs to high-ranking T ory P arty figures such as Neil Hamilton and Jonathon Ait- kin and countless others unproven. This Egyptian was happily undermining democracy in Britain. When news of the bribes broke, Al-F ayed was only to happy to own up and was willing to expose many others as bribe-takers. These 'sleaze' incidents were further nails in the coffin of the Establishment's political place-men, The Conservative P arty , who were to lose heavily at the next election (although, the establishment, devious as ever had infiltra- ted Bilgerburger T ony Blair's new right-wing Labour party as a contingency"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 115 measure). This was an Egyptian citizen who had power to destroy a Bri- tish Government. The once ally of the British establishment was now it's victorious enemy. Al-F ayed, in his former days as establishment darling, had struck up an association with Diana. This was very much renewed after Labour won the election and Diana and her Sons took a holiday with Al-fayed on his substantial yacht. This was really rubbing the establishment's nose in it! It was saying, 'I've undermined you, now I've taken you're country's most prized woman. The heir to your throne sees me as an Uncle'. Al-F ayed encourage his playboy son, Dodi, to strike up relations with the Princess and soon ther was a much publicised romance. It had now gone to far for the establishment. Diana had undermined the British constitutional system and was threatening a key industry and this Johnny F oreigner had made them look like fools. Not only this, a possible Al-F ayed half-brother to the heir would have Diana had to be terminated. If they could get Al-F ayed too, so much the better. And so all MI6 needed to do was pick it's moment. Diana's Merc has been tampered with to ensure she is killed. The Merc leaves the Ritz. It's just after midnight – a fair few people about on a P aris night, but not too many. It's quite late.

When Diana was taken to the P aris hospital where she was to be treated, she convinced the doctor there to assist her in escaping. And so, after much convincing and bribery, the doctor agreed and announced her death to the public, almost three hours after she entered the hospital. Afterwards, she (under the guise of death) returned to England where she and the royal family planned her escape and hiding. They used an incredibly life-like mannequin dressed up like Diana for the funeral, and then engaged in the death ceremony. All the while, Diana herself was given plastic surgery and flew to an island in the Carribean. And with this she was finally able to escape the neverending press that haunted her entire life. ------------------------------ Conspiracy Net http://www .conspiracy-net.com ------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES !

The site is ancient, dating back to the time of the Merovingian kings (ca. 500 – 751 A.D .), and before. In pre- Christian times, the P ont de l'Alma was a pagan sacrificial site. Note that in the pagan connotation, at least, sacrifice is not to be confused with murder: the sacrificial victim had to be a willing participant. In the time of the Merovingian kings, the P ont de l'Alma was an underground chamber. F ounder of the Merovingian dynasty was Merovaeus, said to be descended from the union of a sea creature and a F rench queen. Merovaeus followed the pagan cult of Diana. In Middle English, »soul« (Alma) has as etymology »descended from the sea.« »P ont,« has as a Latin root »pontifex,« meaning a Roman high priest. (See also pons, pontis -- bridge; passage.) »Alma« comes from the Latin »almus,« meaning nourishing. One translation of P ont de l'Alma would be »bridge of the soul.« Another would be »passage of nourishment.« All true European royalty is descended from the Merovingians, which are believed to be descendants of Jesus Christ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 119 During the Merovingian era, if two kings had a dispute over property, it was settled in combat at P ont de l'Alma. According to legend, anyone killed there goes straight to Heaven and sits at the right hand of God, watching over all his foe was to do. The person killed in combat was actually considered to be the »winner,« since he became God's eyes on earth and even could manipulate events. The current British royal family are imposters. The House of W indsor is a fraud. But the lineage of Lady Diana Spencer goes back to Charles II of the House of Stewart. The House of Stewart is of *true* royal blood. Diana's sons, W illiam and Harry , have 3-quarters true nobility in their blood. Princess Diana was in a powerful position. T wo main factions vied for control over her: (1) the New W orld Order faction, founded on an alliance between King W illiam III (Bank of England, modern system of finance, and »national debt« all beginning during his reign) and later, the Rothschilds, and (2) the true nobility of Europe. *W ithin* the New W orld Order faction, there are smaller, warring factions, exemplified by Rothschilds vs. Rockefellers. The plan of the New W orld Order faction was to marry Lady Diana to an American. Even though Bill Clinton has bastard roots in the Rockefeller clan, he is rejected by them and is aligned with the Rothschilds. Bill Clinton was the designated future husband for Lady Diana, with Hillary Clinton to be eliminated through divorce or even murder. The Rockefellers were furious; in no way would they allow a marriage between Bill Clinton and Lady Diana. In Great Britain, Prince W illiam would be on the throne by age 25; if Prince Charles did not abdicate, he would be assassinated. Then, Prince Harry and the living Lady Diana would have moved to the U .S. Harry would become a U .S. citizen and go into politics, becoming perhaps a U .S. Senator . By then, whoever controlled the two boys -- Prince W illiam and Prince Harry -- would control the world."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! But in her last visit to the White House, circa January 1997, Lady Diana informed Mr . Bill Clinton that in no way, shape, or form would she *ever* marry him. (While in America, Lady Diana also met with John K ennedy, Jr .) Diana chose, instead, to marry for love. (Jackie K ennedy married Aristotle Onassis for power; he could protect her .) Dodi F ayed, beloved of Lady Diana, is a cousin of Adnan Khashoggi, a CIA asset involved in sales of arms to Iran -- he and Oliver North. Adnan Khashoggi is part of the Saudi royal family. Through marrying Dodi F ayed, Diana would have been marrying into the Saudi royal family. She might have had to convert to Islam. British intelligence (MI-6) arranged the deaths of Lady Diana and Dodi F ayed. It was imperative that the Saudi royal family not have control over Diana. The driver of the ill-fated Mercedes was a »Manchurian candidate« (brainwashed tool), with connections to the F rench military. How did so much alcohol get into his system? Amounts suggested in mass media reports are truly staggering -- so much alcohol that the driver would have had to been carried to the car. The way it happened was, the driver was made to swallow special slowly-digestible balloons containing high-potency alcohol. While he drove, the balloons were slowly digested and he became dangerous behind the wheel. But even within British intelligence there are factions. A rogue faction in MI-6, powerless to prevent the assassination, arranged for the deaths of Lady Diana and Dodi F ayed to happen at P ont de l'Alma. Cleverly, it was known that a death at that historic location would not only »send a signal«; it would eventually lead to the creation of a »Saint Diana.« In Roman paganism, Diana is »Queen of Heaven,« a triple-goddess. »Al-mah,« in mideast language, means »moon goddess.« One aspect of the Roman triple-goddess is the »lunar virgin.« The *al-mahs* served as maidens of Diana, the lunar virgin.

Q UELLE 19: I scanned this excerpt in from the book, »The Delicate Balance«, written by John Zajac. 1989-1990. ISBN Number 0-910311-57-9. ** Begin Excerpt ** Automation ---------- T o understand how 666 relates to this discussion, one needs to explore technology. One pertinent contributor to this technology is the International Business Machines Corporation. IBM developed a laser method of information transfer that has now become universally accepted. Lasers are used for many different applications in society today, such as measuring distances, detecting structural flaws, determining straightness, and so forth. Y ou can see the IBM system at your local supermarket quickly reading prices and controlling inventory as it prints out a list of all purchased items. Since checkers no longer have to punc h keys on a register, check - out time and errors are reduced. This system also provides the shopper with an itemized receipt. That receipt information is stored in a central computer, which keeps inventory and indicates what products the store should order, as well as which products should no longer be carried. But t he use of automation is going considerably further. In fact, in F r esno, California, one of eight regional test cities, a new computer system called Behavior Scan gives shoppers a bar code card that is read at each purchase. The computer then keeps a detailed list of all purchases made by a family, including brands and quantity of each product. This same computer is also attached to the user's home television set to monitor what is being watched. It then selects commercials to be shown to that customer to affect his specific buying habits. While most customers claim that they are not affected by these commercials , the advertising companies have spent a lot of money on research proving otherwise . I s this the start of a more modern version of George Orwell's »1984,« the complete control depicted in V ance P ackard's 'The Hidden P ersuaders'? Certainly, computers are powerful and indispensable tools. Thanks to comput ers, paychecks are deposited automatically into"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 123 checking and savings accounts at predefined rates while many bills and loans are automatically paid on time every month. The system works so well that many institutions give a discount on loans and insurance payments if automatic payment is used (they are more confident that they will be paid and on time). This can convenientiy save time, postage, and worry. The world is positioned to facilitate the ever growing requirements for increased automation and convenience. The convenience of com puters is everywhere. Even a simple inexpensive $3 watch contains a computer. No longer does it merely tell time; it also can add and subtract, keep time in three different zones, give the day and the date, and beep at predetermined intervals. Computerized voices in fancy cars warn you if you have not fastened your seat belt, that your oil is low, or that you are almost out of fuel. The proliferation of computers has created a strong dependence on them, for real need and pure convenience. The average American's name is accessed 35 times a day by computer, and this is only the beginning as we become plugged into the ever-growing system. Our credit card system is also very convenient. Carrying cash is unnecessary and sometimes useless, for example, when renting a car or cashing a check. W ith a cre dit card, transactions are easier, and banks are now able (and more then willing), to deduct payment of your credit card bill automatically from your main account. In fact, paper money soon may become a thing af the past for three reasons: 1. The government is concerned about the advances being made in color xerographic technology. Advanced copy machines will soon be able to produce counterfeit bills that are indistinguishable from government issues. The FBI reported that up to 20 percent of people having access to advanced color copiers will produce some counterfeit bills. 2. The successful introduction of the Smart Card in F rance and U .S. test cities such as W ashington, D .C., and Norfolk, V irginia, may render cash obsolete. This Smart Card, manufactured by Motorola and T oshiba carries a complete history of the user, including a physical description and health record. The card allows direct p ayment to the seller by instantaneously deducting the purchase amount and any service charges directly from the cardholder's"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! account. Thus, not only is the seller paid immediately but, also, the card companies save millions of dollars by eliminating bad payments and personal bankruptcy debts. Reducing credit card fraud should also save card companies large sums of money. F or example, MasterCard could save $25 million annually by eliminating fraudulent cards. By the end of 1990, 20 million fraud-resistant cards will be in use in F rance. Seventeen other countries have agreed to a standard card for all bank machines. V i sa, Eurocheque, Eurocard and MasterCard have already agreed to a method to make their cards, systems, and money access interchangeable. Thus, by eliminating checks and voluntary payments, the credit card industry would save 3.2 billion dollars per year. 3. The F ederal Government is paying close attention to methods for taxing the $300 billion underground economy in the United States. Unreported income costs the U .S. T reasury $90 billion per year. If cash were eliminated, computers could keep track of all income. Evidence that cards may soon replace cash (and checks) was provided by Arco service stations and L ucky supermarkets, which announced in September 1986 that their pumps and check - out stands now accept automatic t eller bank cards. W ith this system, payment is deducted electronically from the user's bank account before the user received his purchase. W ithin one month, 6,400 service stations and supermarkets in 23 states were fitted with the system. The gentlemen who came up with the laser reader in supermarkets for IBM also invented the means of placing the same kind of bar code beneath living tissue in one-billionth of a second. This marking is totally invisible to the naked eye, and it can be read only by a certain type of la ser. The writing and reading is totally harmless and painless. The inventor demonstrated this system in 1979 by marking salmon as they swam downstream. The fish were totally unaware of the process as the laser burned a code into their flesh. The computer then keeps track of the codes. Y ears later, these fish will be detected by the same system as they swim back upstream and are forced through fish ladders and chutes. * Just a s impressive is what W alter W riston, the chairman of CitiCorp did in 1983. He passed a rule within the bank that was later withdrawn as a result of public outcry. His rule stated that unless you were a depositor of $5,000"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 125 or more, you were not entitled to a teller. This meant that the vast majority of depositors would have to stand in line outside the ban k and »talk« to machines. This was an economic move, of course, because banks have had some problems of late. But its message was that people would no longer talk to people. If banks could establish such a policy, then they could make the minimum deposit higher and higher. F inall y everything for everyone would be done by machines. The concern is that we are reaching a highly automated state, which if followed to the next logical step might have profound impacts on how we rate life. Even more startling was an »off the cuff\"' statement made by an other chairman of an eastern megabank: He announced that a method is in place that can imprint in human hands a silicon chip the size of the head of a pin. That chip will include not only the person's identification number, Social Security number, name and birthplace, but also his criminal background, educational level financial worth in the community, and his political affiliations. * Su ch a system is currently manufactured by T a ymar, Inc., W estminster, CO The U .S. Agriculture Department uses the product for cattle. W ill it be used for people in the future? W ith such a system, the minute someone walked through the door of the bank, he would be sensed and the bank would know who he was, where he came fr om, what he did, and how much he was worth. All this would occur before a person could reach the counter. Now this was one step further than even progressive thinkers envisioned. There had been discussions about placing codes on the hand to be used as identification marks, like fingerprints, simila r to package bar codes in supermarkets. W ith such a system you would not need cash or a validated check or even a Smart Card. Y ou could put your hand through a laser and be read by the computer. The store would automatically deduct the amount of the purchase from your account. The method would be efficient in terms of cost, speed, thoroughness, and elimination of bad checks. * But the price of all this automation is individual independence from nameless bureaucrats looking over your shoulder and approving (allowing) every transaction."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! The amount of control would be unprecedented: however, the government would immediately know how to put this control to use. P eople would no longer be able to cheat the government because every time anyone had any money, the government would know about it. The government could collect tax es each time you spent your money, and, thus, there would be no more filing on April 15th. It also means t hat advanced printing and photocopying machines could not be used for cou nterfeiting. Even a law breaker who traded with stolen goods would have his purchase and sale traced by computer as he tried to move or »spend« funds. The government would mo nitor every transaction, knowing precisely everyone's location, actions, and worth. Instant evaluations, approval or disapproval , and tax deductions on every individual would be made. * Such systems are not in the distant future. Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a mark on their right hands in a test of a totally cashless society. T ests also have been conducted in Japan and th e Dominican Republic in Latin America. Small wonder that the government likes this idea. Governments have always liked control. They would like to control everything, even the areas they say they do not want to control, such as business, transportation, education, religion, entertainment, and other governments. If this sounds the least bit exaggerated just look at our government's actions regarding the restrictions of b usiness concerning tax credit, labor laws, advertising, antitrust, and corporate subsidies. Even in deregulation, transportation requires licensing, registration, inspection, subsidies, price controls, flight appro val, and government flight controllers. Although there may be talk of eliminating the F ederal Department of Education there is no attempt to reduce control of school curriculum, subsidies, and even school lunches. Most universities are dependent on federal aid and research grants. The government c o ntrols religion by granting tax exemption to »desired religions« and by making it illegal to pray in school. The government exercises control of entertainment by licensing and or censoring television, radio, movies, and books. The F ederal Government also seeks to control other governments by rewarding or threatening them with trade concessions, military or econonic"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 127 aid, sanctions, or war . The highest people in government, it would seem, want the government to have total control of everything. In Orwell's 1984, the government »took over,« and everyone was controlled by »Big Brother.« In reality, government may take over, not through control of transportation and censorship, but through the economy, the lending institutions, and every financial transaction. Is it too far-fetched to imagine that you may have to take a mark on your hand to be able to buy and sell and exist in a modern society? The technology exists. The chairman of the megabank was asked what it would take to motivate people to put little pieces of silicon under their skin. He answered, »a major catastrophe.« He knew people would not do it voluntarily. Of course if there was a financial or national emergency (catastrophe), the government would exercise unprecedented control, and compliance of citizens would be anything but voluntary. Central Computing ----------------- As mentioned earlier, the impact of computers on society has been enormous. However, their likely future role may be overwhelming. As powerf ul as computers are, their effectiveness is greatly multiplied when they ca n communicate with other computers. F or example, missile launch command co mputers talk to U .S. W eather Bureau computers to update the possible flight paths of thousands of Minuteman missiles every hour. Thus, to enhance a system's capabilities, computers need to talk to computers. T o sort out the eno rmous amount of cross-references, a central computer is needed. The central computer for America is in T exas, and the international computer that ties all the national central computers together is situated in Brussels, Belgium. The Brussels computer is house d in a 13 story building, the first three floors of which are occupied totally by this system's hardware. Because of its size. the Brussels computer is referred to affectionately as »the Beast.« This immense computer has enough capacity to store every detail about the lives of every human being on Earth, the information contained in the Library of Congress, and every book ever printed. Having operated for years, it stores a growing volume of information as additional countries t ie into"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! it ever more heavily. This allows international banking, interstate banking, and quick credit references. Money can be moved from New Y ork to California or London in minutes. If a deposit is made in a bank other than where the check was drawn, banks usually impose a 5 to 10-day holding period. Actually, this practice is just a means for banks to i ncrease their »float« and thus to increase their profits, since the money is transferred within one day. What happens to the money for the other days? The bank uses it to float shorter loans by which the bank earns interest. Banks typically wait longer to issue credit be cause they want to use the money for as many days as possible. Daily manipulation of funds by banks is common. Many banks are forced to move their funds around the globe with the sun to have their reserves where they are needed-in the banks that are open. Even the CIA likes the capability of the central computer because it can check on personnel mobility, foreign trading, and all financial transactions. Many advanced computers are available with many designations, but one is especially interesting. NCR produced a six-core memory computer with 60 bytes per word in conjunction with six bits to the character. It is named and advertised as the 6-60-6 which defines the size and shape of the computer. The only way this can be pronounced is six sixty-six (666). In computer language, 666 has a unique significance. A computer is an information retrieval system, and all of its information is store d as numbers. A computer's memory cell has only two states- o n and off , or mathematically 1 and 0. Thus, every number must be represented in 1's and 0's. W e use a decimal system based on 10; thus, it has 10 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Computers use a binary system using two symbols (0 and 1). T o manage large numbers, computers use a binary coded decimal system (BCD) which consists of groups of four digits, to make up all numbers. By comparing the groups of number listed below one can find each system's equivalent symbol.

The only other number in the BCD system with the same proper ty is its complement 1001, or 9. (However, not every computer counts past 7.) This consistency is the same in every country in the world, unaffected by language because every computer speaks the same language of »1's« and »0's.« Thus, 0110,0110,0110 is 666 universally. In the Book of Revelation; John said that 666 is the mark of the beast. This number also represents the universal consistency of the computers that will be required to control the world's finances and thus the world's people. When John wrote 1,900 years ago, he did not know anything about the binary number system, computers, or why computers would require binary coded decimals. Y et, he stated emphatically that the mark of the beast is 666. Is this to say that the endtime beast is merely a building located in Belgium? No! The Brussels computer is no more the beast than a general is an army. The significance is that computerization for financial dominance is the financial beast.

So, if people worship the »$« symbol too much for what it can acquire, influence, or ac complish, then that can qualify it as the false god. The Bru ssels computer is only the figurehead of a vast, soon-to - be indispen s able financial network that will control all financial transactions and thus all business and people. He who con trols the system controls all. What is feared by some is that whoever is in control wiil demand that all take the code (mark) on their hand to be able to buy and sell. Money , credit cards, and checkbooks would be totally eliminated. Everything would be done through the government, through the computer, giving the government total control. The greatest fear is that when re ceiving the mark, you also may be forced to pledge allegiance to your flag and (as in the days of kings) to your ruler, but in this case the world leader would be the Antichrist. Of course, to have allegiance with the Antichrist is to make a pact with the Devil. If you think that this unified system is very far away, then you have missed some intriguing news items. As you probably are aware, the government has been talking about a national identification number for some time. It is supposed to make record keeping easier and to provide a means of crosschecking. It will help find deserting husbands who owe child support as well as locate tax evaders. Most people anticipate that the Social Security number will play a part in this national identification code. The government's system for identification uses 18 digits, the last nine of which are the Social Security number. V irtually every citizen in the country over the age of 1 will be forced to have a Social Security number. At present, a Social Security number is necessary to have a job or a sav ings/checking account. Starting 1990, every child over one year old must have a Sociai Security number to qualify as a dependent on tax returns. Preceding this 9-digit Social Security number are 3 digits corresponding to one's telephone area code. Obviously, the whole world is tied by phone; even barren deserts with no inhabitants have area codes. In front of these numbers is a country code; for America it is 110. F rom this single universally consistent number, the government will instantly know a person's country, region, and identity. Does that seem logical so far? But that accounts for only 15 digits, and the system is based on 18.

Each of the four shooters, Oswald, Brading, F rattiano and Roselli had a timer and a back up man. Back up men were supposed to pick up the spent shells and get rid of the guns. T imers would give the signal to shoot. Hunt and McCord were there to help. Sturgis was in Miami. F rattiano shot from a second s tory window in the Dal- T ex building across the street from the T exas School Book Depository. He apparently used a handgun-he is an excellent shot with a pistol. F rattiano and his back -up man were »arrested«, driven away from the Dal- T ex building in a police car and released (without being booked). The Dallas police office is in the Dal- T e x building. Roselli shot K ennedy once hitting the right side of his head and blowing his brains out with a rifle from behind a fence in the grassy knoll area. Roselli and his timer went down a manhole behind the fence and followed the sewer line away from Dealey Plaza.

Three men dressed as tramps picked up the spent shells from Dealey Plaza. One was Howard Hunt. Then they drifted over to an empty boxcar sitting on the railway spur behind the grassey knoll area, and waited. A Dallas police officer ordered two Dallas cops to »go over to the boxcar and pick up the tramps«. The three 'tramps' paraded around Dealey Plaza to the P o lice Department in the Dal- T ex B uilding.

A »shoe store manager« told the theatre cashier that a suspicious looking man had sneaked in without paying. F ifteen assorted cops and FBI charged out to the movie theatre to look for the guy who had sneaked in. Oswald had a pistol that wouldn't fire. It may have been anticipated that the police would shoot the »cop-killer« for »resisting arrest«.

Dun and Bradstreet noted this transaction in amazement, listing how F rattiano could explain so much »credit« as his only known title (listed in D &B) was »Mafia-Executioner«.

In spite of the fact that Brading was a known criminal with an arrest record dating back about twenty years, the FBI reported that Brading knew nothing whatsoever about the assassination.

The next day, after Mary Jo died, Joan ran away to Norway, where she was kidnapped by Mafia hoods Mari and Adamo. They locked her up in a Marseille heroin factory.

September 1969: »Gemstones«, with histories, had been released around the globe for several years. In 1969, Roberts gave a Gemstone with history to Mack, head of California CREEP, for Nixon, with the proposition: the Presidency in return for wiping out the Mafia. The »history« included T eddy's phone calls to and from the L awrence Cottage on Chappaquiddick billed to T eddy's home phone in Havannisport. Nixon being Mafia himself, wasn't interes ted; but kept the information to use on T eddy whenever it seemed advantageous. May 4, 1970: Charlotte F ord Niarchos called her ex-husband Stavros, worried about the F ord F oundation's involvement in the Chappaquiddick cover-up. Eugenie Livanos Niarchos, in bed with her husband, ov erheard the con- versation. Stavros was forced to beat her to death; he ruptured her spleen and broke the cartilage in her throat. Cause of death was listed as »overdose of barbituates,« though autopsy showed these injuries. NO TE: L. W ayne Rector was hired around 1955 by the Carl Byoir P .R. Agency (Hugh es L.A. P . R. firm) to act as Hughes double. In 1957 when Onassis grabbed Hughes, Rector continued to act as his stand-in. Rector was the Hughes surrogate in Las V egas; Robert Maheu actually ran the show; Maheu got his orders from Onassis; the six »nursemaids«, called the »Mormon Mafia«, kept Rector sealed off from prying eyes.

After Bobby's death, T eddy knew who did it. He ran to Onassis afraid for his life and swore eternal obedience. In return, Onassis granted him his life and said he could be President, too, just like his big brother, if he would behave himself and folow orders. September 16, 1968: Hit and run accident on Robert's car parked in front of the R ussian consulate on S.F . who routinely takes pictures of everything that goes on in front of the consulate. Their photos showed the license plate of the hit and run car UKT-264, on a blue Cadillac belonging to Angela Alioto, Joe's daughter, being driven by T om Alioto, Joe's son whose driving license had been revoked. His licen se and the cars license were both fraudulent. T o cover up the hit and run circumstances, B .F . MPJ's from the Presido quickly staged a few more hit and runs on the same corner all duly filmed by the R ussians. Katheryn H ollister, the Alioto family nurse was »persuaded« to take the rap for the hit and run. Roberts threatened to spill the whole story in court with photos. Next evening Brading and F rattiano showed up in the Balck Magic Bar, Brading wearing his x-marked hat from Dallas to see whether Roberts recognized it, how much he knew, etc. A S.F . MP from the Presidio piped up from the end of the bar, »Iheard they let everyone with an X-marked hatband through the police lines at Dallas«. Cover up support for Alioto in the hit and run was completed. End of 1970: Howard H ughes presence on earth no longer required. His handwritting could be duplicated by a computer. His biography all the known facts about his life had been compiled and a computerized biography issued to top Hughes executives. His double – Rector – had been doing »Hughes« for years. And Hughes was ill. Clifford Irving, author of Hoax, about an art forger, became interested in » Hughes«. Living on Ibazza, he heard the Mediterranean gossip that »Hughes« was a hoax, too. He went to »Hughes« so-called »Mormon Mafia«, the six nursemaids for information. One of them, Merryman perhaps, tired of the game, gave Irving the computerized Hughes biography and from it Irving wrote his »autobiography«. Hughes' death was expected shortly. Preparations were being made so that it would not interfere with the orderly continuation of his empire. Irving wrote his book and the pub lishers anounced it. Onassis knew someone had given Irving the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! information. He thought it was Maheu and fired him in November, 1970. On Thanksgiving Eve, 1970, in the middle of the night »Hughes« (Rector made a well-publicized »secret departure« from Las V egas to the Bahamas). December 1970: Onassis discovered his mistake and had Merryman killed. Robert Maheu accidentally deprived of his half-million dollars annual salary, sued »Hughes« for millions mentioning »Hughes« game plan for the purchase of Presidents, governors, Senators, judg es, etc. Onassis paid off cheap at the price to maintain his custodianship of »American democracy« and the »free world« and keep fro m hanging for multiple murders. The »Hughes« Mormon Mafia party, plus Rector, fled around the world from the Bahamas where they murdered an uncooperative Governo r and P o lice Chief, to Nicaragua, where they shot the U .S. Ambassador between the eyes for noticing that there wasn't really any Hughes; and then to Canada, where Mormon Mafia nursemaid Sckersley looted a goodly sum in a swindle of the Canadian Stock Exchange; and on to London to Rothschild's Inn of the P ark. April 18, 1971: Howard Hughes, a human vegetable as the result of serious brain damage du ring his 1957 hustle, plus fourteen years of heroin, grew sicker and sicker. A final overdose of heroin did him in. His coffin was lowered into the sea from a rocky headland off the coast of Skorpios. Present at the funeral were: Jackie K ennedy Onassis, T eddy K ennedy, F rancis L. Dal e , Director of CREEP, and a South V ietnamese cardinal named Thue. Onassis allowed some pictures to be taken from a distance; he himself did not appear. The pictu res were published in Midnight, a Canadian tabloid. Albanian frogmen, tipped off, were waiting under the water. They siezed the coffin and took the corpse off to Y ugoslavia, then to China, R ussia and then perhaps to Boston in a foot locker. The corpse's dental work was compared to Hughes very own dental records and they matched. News of Hughes death, the U .S. take-over by Onassis and the facts surrounding the murders of JFK, RFK, Martin L uther King, Mary Jo K opechne, and many more and the subsequent cover-ups (involving still more murders) had been circ ulating around the globe for several years. Any country with this information can blackmail the U .S> Mafia government, which has no choice but to pay up. The alternative is to be exposed as a bunch of treasonous murderers. This is why China-hating, red-hating Nixon was forced to recognize China (which he now claims as his greatest accomplishment).

Starting at the top with F or d, Rockefeller and Kissinger. Super-patriots please note: No one, not all of the radicals and subversives hounded by the US domestic intelligence put together has done one fraction of the damage done to US economy, morality, power and prestige as by the theives at the top. On the day that Hughes was buried, Clifford Irving's wife presented a publisher's check mode out to »H. Hughes« to Onassis' Swiss Ba nk for payment. Onassis paid off cheaply at the price. Gemstone papers rolling around the world here and abroad kept the situation hot. Everyone was nervous. Rockefeller gave Kissinger $50,000 for Carlson and Brisso n to write their 'expose' The Alioto Mafia W e b for L OOK magazine. Their mission: find out e verything that was public record about Alioto's connection with the JFK murder. There was a pay-off to F rattiano, listed in D&B. They were to explain it any way that didn't lead back to Dallas. The idea was to get Alioto to quietly go away but still keep the lid on everything. May, 1971: T ina Livanos Onassis Blandford married Starvon Niarchos, her former brother-in-law until he killed her sister, Eugenie. May, 1971: »F olk Hero« Daniel Ellsberg, a well-known hawk from the Rand Corporation, who had designed the missile ring around the »Iron Curtain« countries (how many missiles to aim at which cities) was told to release the faked-up »P entagon P apers« to help distract people from Hughes, JFK, RFK, MLK etc. The papers were carefully designed by Ellsberg and his boss, Rand Chief and new W o rl d Bank Chief Bob (Body Count) McNamara, to make the V ietnamese W ar look like »just one of those incredibly dumb mistakes«. This helped to cover up the real purpose of the war: continued control, for Onassis and his friends of the Golden T r iangle dope trade : V ietnam, Laos and Cambodia; and for Onassis and the oil people of Eastern oil sources, to say nothing of control over huge F ederal sums, which could be siphoned off in profitable arms contracts, or conveniently 'disappear' in the war effort. McNamara's 'W orld Bank' handing-out of American money to 'starving nations' actually set up huge private bank accounts for various dictators in the Onassis- controlled Swiss bank. The money could be used as needed to support and extend Mafia operations.

P erhaps they are even larger. The money drained from America and other captive Mafia nations feeds a greed that can never be satisfied. Rand Corp ., one of our major 'think tanks' has another goody in store for the public: »Project Star« – Rand's cover-up fallback version of the JFK murder held in reserve should public restlessness over the W arren Commission Report cover-up ever threaten to get out of hand. That ought to confuse the people for at least another twelve years, and by that time most of us will be dead anyway.... NO TE IN P ASSING: The dope trade routes are: Golden T riangle to T aiwan to San F rancisco. Heroin from the Golden T riangle was sometimes smuggled i nto San F rancisco in the bodies of American GIs who died in battle in V ietnam. One body can hold up to 40 pounds of heroin, crammed in where the guts would be. Some dope gets pressed into dinner plates and painted with pretty patterns. One dope bust in S.F . alone yielded $6 billion in herion 'china plates' – the largest dope bust in history. It was quickly and completely hushed up by the S.F .-Mafia press. The dope sat in the S.F .P .D . for a while, then was removed by FBI men and probably sent on its way to American veins. All this dope processing and shipping is controlled and supervised by the Mafia for the Mafia. Dope arrests and murders are aimed at indepen- dant pushers and maverick peddlers and smugglers who are competing with or holding out on the Mafia. While Nixon was conducting his noisy campaign against dope smuggling accross the Mexican border, his dope officer in charge of protecting the Mafia dope trade was E. Howard Hunt! Lots of heroin gets processed in a P epsi Cola factory in Laos. So far, it hasn't produced a single bottle of P epsi Cola. Some dope gets processed in heroin factories in Marseilles. (See the F rench Connection). Still more dope comes from South America --- cocaine and new heroin. US aid went to build a highway accross P araguay. Useless for the natives who have no cars. (They use it for sunbathing in the day), it becomes the longe st landing strip in the world and serves airplanes loaded with cocaine. It is financed by US tax money for the benifit of the international Mafia dope pushers. And then there is opium from T urkish morphine.

Recently indicted for this swindle by the SEC in a civil suit were »Howard Hughes« and Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder, not usually associated with the Hughes crowd, and others. June 1971: Ney Y ork T imes began publishing the P entagon P apers, Rand Corp's prepared cover-up of the real reasons for the V ietnamese war. Nixon had gotten a copy of the first Gemstone P apers circulated in the U .S. back in 1969. He was now wondering how much information Democratic Chairman Larry O'Brien had about Hughes, Onassis, JFK, RFK, etc. and more specifically how much of the dirt the Democrats planned to use. Nixon set up the »plumbers unit« to stop security leaks, investigate other security matters. Erlichman, Krogh, Liddy, Hunt, Y oung, etc. Hunt as »White House consultant« supposedly worked for the Mullen Corp. a CIA cover. Mullen's head client was »Howard Hughes« Robert Bennett was the head of the Mullen Corp. June 28, 1971: Ellsberg indicted for leaking the P entagon P apers.

Question: Why the intense b attle between Mafia forces? Answer: While Onassis was the re cognized crowned head of the Mafia, intense, no holdsbarred scuffling for the lucrative second spot (control of U .S. Presidency, government and so on) was permissible and encouraged under the Mafia code of rules. The only stipulation: Outsiders mustn't know about it. »Hughes« contributed liberally and equally to both Democratic and Republican parties for the 1972 election.

January, 1972: The W atergate team showed up at the San F rancisco Drift Inn, a CIA-FBI safe-house hangout bar, where Roberts conducted a nightly Gemstone rap for the benefit of any CIA or FBI or anyone who wandered in for a beer. James McCord, Martinez, Bernard Barker, Garcia and F r ank Sturgis showed up – along with a San F rancisco dentist named F uller. James McCord remarked: »Sand and Arab oil with hydrogen heat makes glass brick threat of war to Arab nations«. The event, like the other nightly raps, was taped by the Dr ift Inn bartender, Al Stern, who was paid to do so by his old friend, Katherine Graham, but told his other friend, Roberts, about it. The bar was also wired for sound by Arabs, R ussians and Chinese.

A »Hughes« get away plane would stand by to take the White House burglers to Mexico. F ebruary, 1972: Liddy and Hunt traveled around a lot, using »Hughes T ool Co.« calling cards, and aliases from Hunt's spy novels. Liddy, Hunt and other W atergaters dropped by for a beer at the Drift Inn, where they were photographed on bar stools for Katherine Graham. These photos were later used in the W ashington P ost, when Liddy, Hunt and others were arrested at W atergate because CIA men like Liddy and Hunt aren't usually photographed.

Robert's quoting prices to Liddy at the Drift Inn made their deaths a mortal cinch.

F ebruary, 1972: F rancis L. Dale, head of CREEP and ITT Board of Directors member, pushed Magruder to push Liddy into W atergate. In a Mafia-style effort to shut Roberts up, his fathe r was murdered by »plumbers« team members Liz Dale (F rancic L.

In the hospital, »nurse« Liz Dale and »doctor« Martinez assisted him to sniff a quadruple-strength can of aerosol medicine enough to kill him the next day. The day before, T isseront, head of the College of Cardinals at the V atican, was pushed out of a V atican wi ndow.

March 21, 1973: Nixon said that on this date, he »received new evidence on W aterg ate«. Lipset bragged on T . V . that he had been the one to bring new evidence to Nixon. Meanwhile, back at the W ashington P ost, Katherine Graham had been feeding W oodward and Bernstein information for their articles. May 10, 1973: The first witness at the W atergate hearing running down the names on the CREEP organizational chart, mentioned the name at the top: F rancis L. Dale, Chairman. Dale was never mentioned again during the rest of the trial. July 9, 1973: Roberts had used Al Strom's Drift Inn bar as an open lecture forum for any and all and Al Strom taped it, for his boss, Katherine Graham. But Al was fair and told Roberts he was doing it, for which he was murdered on this date. Augu st 1973: Murder of Chile, by Group of 40: (Rockefeller and his man Kissinger), working with the CIA and $8 million. Allende's Chile. Admiral Noel Gaylor, Navel Intelligence, told Roberts 1 1/2 years earlier that Chile would get it: Roberts warned the Chilean consul in advance: Allegria, now »teaching« at Stanford. ITT had now extracted $125 million payment for its Chilean plants, a good return for their $8 million. Mafia controlled Chile's annual inflation rate has set a world's record. March 19, 1973: Dean to Nixon, nervously: »There is a cancer growing on the Presidency«.

October 10, 1974: T ina Livanos Onassis Blandford Niarchos, sodium morphate poisoned by hubby Stravos, puked, slept and died of »heart attack«. Losing his son Alexander, took all the fun out of killing for Onassis. Who was there left to inherit the world empire he had dreamed of handing over to his son? December, 1974: Brezhnev had scheduled a meeting with Sadat. The outcome wouldn't help the U .S. no matter how many trips Henry made to the mid-East with clean socks and blank checks. A new U .S. »secret weapon« was apparently used, a tiny speck of metal, introduced somehow into Brezhnev's lymph system. It lodged in the cluster of lymph nodes over his heart, and there it was coated with layers of, much as an oyster created a pearl around an irritating grain of sand. Brexhnev's lymph system clogged up: he got the flu and the meeting with Sadat was cancelled. R ussian doctors X-rayed him and found a hugh lump in his chest. Then they put him before a Kirlian camera and checked his aura for cancer. No cancer. Note: Kirlian photography is the latest R ussian diagnostic tool. It reveals the presence of disease physical or moral (it also detects lies). Brezhnev's lump had to be treated with radiation therapy: hence the rumors he had cancer> It took six weeks to clear up. March, 1975: Onassis died. The Mafia Organization regrouped itself. Prince F isal watched his uncle, King F isal, si lently watch the shift of Mafia P o wer and couldn't stand it anymore. He shot his uncl e, the spiritual leader of 60,000,000 Moslems, who had played ball with Onassis all along. South V ietnam's Thieu, dubious about which way the Mafia cooky would crumble, now that O nassis was dead, decided the time was right for him to split. He abandoned the war effort, cursed the U .S., and split for T aiwan, his plane so overloaded with gold bullion that he had to dump some of it overboard."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 M ARC L UTTER : S IE K ONTROLLIEREN ALLES ! March 15, 1975: Roberts got the »Brezhnev Flu« and spent 2 weeks at U .C. Hospital. Doctors there without the Kirlian photography diagnostic technique, assumed the softball sized lump over his heart was cancer. It wasn't. April, 1975: The C ambodian domino was no fun at all – it fell right over. Premier Lon Nol fled to exile in a Hawaiian suburb. CIA chief Colby, in a fit of spite, leaked the stolen story of CIA Hughes Glomar Explorer's raising of the drowned R ussian sailors from their sunken nuclear submarine. P u rpose: T o bag the R ussians and also to halt criticism o f the CIA by pointing out how noble, brave and self-sacrificing they are in their efforts to save us. The R ussians are funny about their dead. They bitterly resented Colby's game. They quietly went through a massive navel »war game«, the r ehearsal of a nuclear attack on the U .S. Which brings us almost to the present time. F ord, Kissinger and Rockefeller squat like toads on the corpse of America. By the time of the Bi-centenial the stink may be unbearable. F ord now plans a propoganda mode version of his book, »P o rtrait of an Assassin«, which will reiterate the exploded cock and bull notion that Oswald was JFK's lone assassin. W ith singular inept misunderstanding of the times, he s eems to think Americans will take his word for it and be re -assured in the face of those crackpot conspiracy theories. He doesn't seem to realize that he will be reminding or informing Americans of his role on the infamous W arren Commission.

Statements of Conjecture A conspiracy theorist is a modern day heretic.

In studying c onspiracy theory, one finds many differing stories and spins.

Th e devil doesn't »make« people do things -- people choose to commit evil acts. Based on my own research, I believe that a network or networks of multi- generational cults are fomenting conspiracy against mankind. Are there any good guys, really? Are there bad guys? Who's to know? Like I said, there are many stories and many spins, all of which deserve much wider public debate in a forum such as CTRL. My personal take is that there is a definite group of »baddies« that move through various organizations at differing times and locales, similar to the plans which Adam W ieshaup t outlined in the Illuminati papers, which were se ized by the Bavarian Government. (And there a re those that put a whole another layer of conspiracy about that revelation). There is much research and conjecture to draw from, and researchers may arrive at very similar, or completely different, conclusions. L yndon LaRouche has his take on the conspiracy; A -albionic posits a power struggle between the V atican and English F reemasonry; author John Daniel sees the conspiracy as a war between English and F rench F reemasonary. There are the T emplers versus the Knights of St. John's (Malta), there's the Order of Skull & Bones, the Nazis and of course the all-encompassing, all-pervasive Illuminati. These a just a few examples of the various worldviews shared among conspiracy theorists. Amidst all these purported plots and sub - plots lies the role of orga n ized religion and the recent disclosures regarding the relevations of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Hopefully CTRL can pull on the resources of the many to help us all understand and make use of that understanding to meet the future head on. I do believe that we have an elite that suppresses both history and science. I believe that we are in a time when all shall be made known, and I believe it behooves us to understand the methods of propaganda that are being used against our body politic. I believe that through our combined efforts, we can progress from a society in which an elite uses the shield of secrecy to abet their plans of darkness, into a new digital age which will breath new life into our Republic, transforming it into a free and open society where"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Q UELLENANHANG 161 everyone has equal access to all information, the quintessential tap root of power .
