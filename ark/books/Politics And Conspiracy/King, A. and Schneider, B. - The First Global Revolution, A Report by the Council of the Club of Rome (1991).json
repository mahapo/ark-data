It marked the zenith as well as the end of the long post-war period of rapid economic growth in the industrialized countries. But it was also a year of social unrest with the eruption of student uprisings in many countries and other manifestations of alienation and counter cultural protest. In addition, it was at that time that general and vocal public awareness of the problems of the environment began to emerge. A number of individuals close to decision-making points became concerned about the apparent incapability of governments and the international organizations of foreseeing, or even attempting to foresee, the consequences of substantia] material growth without sufficient thought as to the quality aspects of the life that unprecedented general affluence should make possible. It was felt that a group of independent thinkers concerned with the long-term and deeper issues would be useful in complementing the work of the bigger organizations. The Clubof Rome took shape that year from these considerations, and was founded by Aurelio Peccei and Alexander King at the Academia dei Lincei In Rome. It chose as its initial theme, 'The Predicament of Mankind.' Aurello Peccei was ts first president, a post he retained till his death in 1984. At present, the group comprises one hundred independent individuals from fifty-three countries. The Club has absolutely no political ambition. Its members represent a wide diversity of cultures, ideologies, professions and disciplines, and are united in a common concern for the future of humanity. From the outset, the Club's thinking has been governed by three related conceptual guidelines:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"viii • Foreword —adopting a global approach to the vast and complex problems of a world. In which Interdependence between nations within a single planetary system is constantly growing; —focussing on issues, policies and options in a longer term perspective than is possible for governments, which respond to the immediate concerns af an insufficiently informed constituency; —seeking a deeper understanding of the interactions within the tangle of contemporary problems - political economic, social, cultural. psychological, technological and environmental - for which the Club of Rome adopted the term 'the world ptoblcmatique\". The world problematique has become, as it were, the trademark of the Club. We define it as the massive and untidy mix of Interrelated difficulties and problems that form the predicament in which humanity finds itself. For our present purposes we have coined a corresponding term, 'the world resolutique', which connotes a coherent, comprehensive and simultaneous attack to resolve as many as possible of the diverse elements of the problematique. or at least to point out ways to solutions and more effective strategics. By the resolutique 1 , we do not suggest a grand attack on the totality of the problematique. Our proposal is rather a simultaneous attack on its main elements with, in every case, careful consideration of reciprocal impact from each of the others. In a world in which problem-solving Initiatives are increasingly immobilized by bureaucracies, dierc is a growing role for flexible and informal groups such as the Club of Rome. Our first publication. The L imits to Growt, appeared In 1972 as a report to (rather than by ) the Club of Rome. The study, commissioned by the Club, was accomplished by an international team of professors and researchers at MIT using the system dynamics methodology of Jay Forrester. This was a pioneerng attempt to project in interaction a number of quantifiable elements of the problematique. The report and the controversy It generated immediately gave the Club of Rome worldwide visibility or, as some would say. notoriety. It thereby achieved its main objective: the stimulation of a great debate on growth and society throughout the world and an increased awareness of the interactions that take place between the elements of the problematique. The report has sold some ten million copies in over thirty languages and has had considerable political impact. The Club was widely criticized for what was seen as advocacy of a zero growth economy. This was never our Intention. We fully accepted the pressing need for material growth in the poor countries of the world, but warned readers about the consequences of an unthinking pursuit of growth by the industrialized countries, depletion of the world resource base, deterioration of the Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Forawrd • ix environment, and the domination of material values in society. Since 1971, the Club has published eighteen reports on a wide variety of issues (see Rbliography). The second among ihesc. Mankind at the Tunlna Point by professors Pcstel and Mcsarovic, was a computerised growth model which also took regional situations into account. It included a strong warning of die high costs in terms of money and human suffering which would result from delays In taking action. Two decades later, the contemporary problematique remains the same in its underlying causes as that of 1972, but differs in its mix of issues and its points. of emphasis. Humanity will always have to live with the problems of Its time, no matter how effective die resolutique his been in die past. Changing situations, notably those arising from the solution of past problems, give rise to new difficulties which, as always, interact. Furthermore, in times of rapid change such as the present, the mix of problems and the understanding of their relative importance Is likely to change rapidly. This Is partly because some of our perceptions have become clearer and partly because new knowledge has identified new dangers. Of course, the two most dominant elements arc probably those of the population explosion In the South and of the only recendy recognized macro-effects of man on his environment, which were exacdy the two central preoccupations in The Limitss to Growth. But new factors, such as changes In human behaviour, the emergence of seemingly irrational movements including terrorism, and die growdi of individual and collective selfishness, thrown up by our materialistic society, have definitely become elements of today's problematique. Such matters arc obviously relevant when considering the present situation. The human being both creates the problematique and suffers its consequences. The problematique therefore demands a systematic analysis that pays due attention not only to what is regarded as rational behaviour, but also to instinctive and apparendy irrational elements inherent in human nature that make for an uncertain world. If the Club is to live up to Its role. It Is essential that we reexamine the problematique, attempt to elucidate more clearly some of its Interactions, and Issue warnings about the consequences and trends determined by the persistence of present economic systems and human behaviour. With the possible exception of the nuclear threat, the present dangers to humanity are probably greater and more Imminent than those in 1972. We shall, no doubt, be accused zs before of being harbingers of doom. This may well be our role and our glory. However, prophesying doom is by no means our sole or even main intention.

The topic of recent Club of Rome meetings has been 'The Great Transition': we are convinced that we are in the early sages of the formation of a new type of world society which will be as different from today's, as was that ushered in by the Industrial Revolution from the society of the long agrarian period that preceded it. The Initial but by no means the only motor force of this change has been the emergence of a cluster of advanced technologies, especially those made possible by microelectronics and the new discoveries o: molecular biology. These are creating what is variously called the information society, the post-industrial society, or the service society, in which employment, life-styles and prospects, material and otherwise, will be very different from those of today for every human being. We only need to mention as examples of change the population explosion in the Southern countries, the probability of great changes and disturbance in world climate, the pr ecarious nature of global fx>d security, doubts on energy availability ard the vast changes taking place in the geopolitical situation - all of which interact within the complex of the problematique. We are convinced that the magnitude of these changes amount to a major revolution on a worldwde scale. 1989 and 1990 were years when the course of history suddenly speeded up: communist regimes in eastern Europe collapsed, East and West Germany became a single nation again, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990 provoked Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 • The First Global Revolution a deadly crisU in the Gulf. Though these were by no means the only events of the period, they were by far the most spectacular, and despite their geographic dispersal, they were interconnected: the end of the cold war and of East-West tension blew the lid off the world pressure-cooker, as it were, and enabled latent conflicts to emerge ri the open and long-repressed aspirations to express themselves forcefull). In the coming years, it is very likely that other events will come to the forefront of world attention, while today's events will be pushed into the background. This book was written before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the creation in its place of a loose confederation of independent republics. The changes still taking place there do not alter what follows. Indeed, they confirm our statement, made In early 1991, that the Gulf War is the first example of a series of phenomena that will most certainly affect the world profoundly in the coming decades. The Gulf War was in many ways a warning signal and should lead to a new vision of international relations. It confirmed the existence of tension, which will continue to grow between the rich countries and the poor countries, between :hc North and the South, while the injustice and humiliation it breeds is found especially and increasingly unbearable by the Arab-Muslim countries. The war has also been a demonstration of a new attempt by the United States to reassert its hegemonic presence in a number of regions of the world, while putting its force at the service of right and legalism. The ambiguity of American policy, despite the fact that it has often shown proof of goodwill, is not going to make the internatonal relations of the United State; any easier In future. The end of the cold war has led to the awakening of nationalism, that had been stifled under the lid of East-West tension, and will inevitably produce conflicts cf varying degrees. However, it must be stressed that the process of disarmament that was undertaken between the United States and the Soviet Union is a positive element - butnotsuffkiendyso. Disarmament in high-risk zones and a stria control by the United Nations of the sales of sophisticated arms have to be a priority if we expect to prevent other confrontations, ai bloody ar.d paradoxical as those in the Gu!f War. Will the budding democracy in Benin, as that in the East European and Latin American countries grow strong and spread, or will its failure to do so lead back to authoritarian governments?

These are the signs that mark this first global revolution and they indicate the uncertainty widi which the future of the planet is confronted. But why do we regard the contemporary threats and changes as the first global revolution ? The change from the hunting and gathering phase to one of settled farming may have taken thousands of years to spread throughout the world. The Industrial Revolution that began in the United Kingdom about two centuries ago is as yet geographically incomplete. However, the present brutal changes are taking place everywhere simultaneously from causes which are likewise ubiquitous, thus causing the 'Sturm und Drang' of a universal revolution. The worldwide significance of this revolution becomes vasdy greater if one considers that its mismanagement could endanger the whole human race. The new society is emerging from the chrysalis of the often archaic and decadent old societies; Its evolution is cemplex and uncertain and its manifestations are difficult in decipher, making the tasks of the decision­ makers in both public and private sectors more difficult than ever, and inducing a permanent uncertainty in all thinking Individuals. Elements or transitional facets of the new society are appearing here and there without obvious nes between them. The global revolution has no ideological basis. It is being shaped by an unprecedented mixture of geostrategic upheavals caused by social, economic, technological, cultural and ethical factors. Combinations of these factors lead to unpredictable situations. In this transitional period, humanity Is therefore facing a double challenge - having to grope its way towards an understanding of the new world with its many hidden facets and also, amidst the mists of uncertainty, to Icam bow to manage the new world and not be managed by it. Our aim must be essentially normative - to visualize the sort of world we would like to live In, to evaluate the material, human and moral resources available, to make our vision realistic and sustainable, and then fn mohjlt7r rhc human energy and political will to forge the new global society. In matter; of public concern, as In other areas of human interest, fashions prevail, Yesterday the nuclear problem was uppermost in people's minds; later the population explosion reached the headlines; today the environment is a la mode and concern with population has receded. The energy crisis was seldom mentioned publicly earlier, but the events in the Middle East have already mace this the new preoccupation. The need Is to consider all these as essential angles of illumination in the kaleidoscope of planetary change.

Forecasting is necessary, and will necessarily be a relative failure. Simple extrapolation of existing trends will not give us realistic answers. The Umit \\o Gnwl/i 1 had developed an interactive simulation model that produced a variety of scenarios which were especially useful for defining what was to be prevented. In some fields such as technology and industry, long-term forecasting Is Indispensable and efforts in that direction are being made by some of the most forward looking corporations, which are struggling to invent new methodologies for planning in uncertainty. In the thirties, the American president Franklin D. Roosevelt commissioned his administration to undertake a vast study of the coming technologies. When the study was published It made a very big impression. Indeed, it was enthralling. There was just one problem: it had not predicted the coming of television, nor that of plastic, or jet planes, or organ transplants, or laser beams, not even of ball-points pensP Franz-Olivier Gtesbert* One aspect of the contemporary situation Is an increasing awareness that the human race, In pursuit of material gain by the exploitation of nature. Is racing towards the destruction of the planet and itself. The threat of nuclear destruction, although less imminent, is always with us. and the possibility of irreversible climatic change with only dimly foreseeable consequences is an Imminent menace. Such ingredients of the present problematiquc are global in character and cannot be tackled by even the largest powers in isolation. Only if all the inhabitants of the planet realize that they are facing immediate and common dangers, can a universal political will be generated for united action to secure the survival of humanity. This is why we call for the creation of world solidarity. The term 'solidarity' has been greatly misused and seriously devalued. Its application to circumstances in which motivation* for common belief or action were too weak, have given it a somewhat Utopian and insubstantial connotation. In the present circumstances, however, the extent of danger to the future well being of all the inhabitants of the planet gives such enhanced force to the necessity for solidarity, that unity and stability must plainly be generated. 1 This was ihc lira Report to ihc Club of Rome (Mettbws et al W73J. i CKtbert, 10».

Our wish was briefly- even if superficially and Incompletely - to lay out elements that ma? already be known in order to show how they interact and through their entanglement, to state our oudook on the present world problemaoque as clearly as possible. We do not intend to draw up a blueprint of concrete actions for the salvaoon of the world. Nevertheless, our analysis of the situation encourages us to make a number of practical proposals, to suggest possible lines of action and to indicate necessary changes in attitude. Never before has humanity possessed, as itdocs today, the knowledge and the skills, the resources and the cohesion to shape a better world. This should generate hope In all people. Yet there is widespread uneasiness and fear of Impending changes which in impinging on the still incomplete changes of recent decades will add to the uncertainty. This very uncertainty, together with the removal of the traditional restrictions of the past and the new hopes for the future provides an enormous impetus for reshaping the world society. The tragedyof the human condition Is thai we have not yet reached a position to realize our potential. We see the world and its resources being grossly mismanaged, yet we are lulled by the complacency of our leaders and our own inertia and resistance to change. Time is running out. Some problems have already reached a magnitude which is beyond the point of successful control and the costs of delay are monstrously high. Unless we wake up and act quickly It could be too late. This book is organized in two parts. The first deals with the problematique and purports to present the main changes of the last two decades, to describe the malaise which they have caused and to outline some of uSe most important issues and dangers which humanity has to race unitedly. The second part describes the resolutiquc and attempts to present a number of actions which. at this stage, seem especially necessary to pursue. Finally we return to the need to generate world solidarity. The Fin! Global Revolution is written for all. those who have the spark of the explorer, the discoverer, the risk-taker - mc learner. These are the people we shall have to count on to face the appalling issues described herein, to scr thc goals and try to reach them and to learn from their failures and successes, to go on trying - learning.

The seeds of the coming global revolution have been germinating slowly over many years, during which complexity and uncertainty in conditions and rapid change arc beginning to overwhelm the capacity of governments all over the world. Indeed, governments never like change. Wedded to the status quo. they react to symptoms of change. but seldom to the causes which tend to be regarded with suspicion as possibly being 'subversive' in nature. One of the most obvious aspects of human frailty is too much concentration on the immediate, with too little care for future consequences — an insistence on immediate gratification. This applies to institutions as well i$ to people. Governments operating under the tyranny of the next election focus on the present Issues and avoid more distant but, frequently, more fundamental matters. Corporations, likewise, bow to the tyranny of next year's bottom line, although both governments and enterprises do try to look beyond the next election or annual report in much of what they do.

This had many repercussions on its economy and society; It had a strong impact on the world investment pattern and caused many policy modifications as. for example. In the attitude of the United States to the Middle East. The crisis was a clear warning to the industrialized countries about the dependence of their economies on the secure supply of raw materials and energy, which in turn was (and is) dependent on events in distant places which are largely beyond their control. In today's world all curves are exponential. It Is only In mathematics that exponential curves grow to infinity. In real life they either break down catastrophkally or they saturate gently, it is our duty as thinking people to strive towards a gentle saturation although this poses new and very difficult questions. Dennis Gabor 2 The oil crisis brought home to most of the oil-importing developing countries the extent of their reliance on cheap fuels, with hardly any local energy alternative; it also led these countries into excessive external indebtedness, not so much to foster development, but to pay uSe oil bill. This crisis and other factors have led to a considerable lowering of economic growth rates from the high levels of the previous decades. However, achievement of economic growth still remains the main explicit goal of economic policy, with too little consideration of differential needs and quality aspects. How far the published growth figures reflect real Increase In human welfare is open to question. If, for example, an economy grows at an annual rale of 5%, it would, by the end of the next century, reach a leve of 500 times greater for 50,000% higher) than the current level. Eduard Pestel Much of what is counted as growth Is probably not gtowth at all. For example, in the United States of President Reagan, growth figures concealed overconsu motion and public underinvestment, deterioration of the infrastructure, decay of the inner cities, and social degradation. Nor Is there any evidence that growth in the North leads in time to development in the South. 1. Meadows. 1972. 2 Nobel Prlw winnet. inventor of holography I Cabot, 197S|. 3.

Already the political dominance of the two superpowers was beginning to dwindle, but the cold war not only ruled East-West relations, It also defined the whole international system, torn apart by ideological polarization. The recent events IF. USSR and Eastern Europe have therefore shaken not only the region, but the whole planet. The collapse of economic communism and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact bloc of nations has aroused great hopes -and is invested witi? great dangers. The situation is extremely fluid, has few constraints, and the consolidation of present trends offers great opportunities for the structuring and renewal of a much wider region, and possibly of the world system as a whole. History is unlikely to provide another opportunity as open and promising as today's, and it is essential for humanity to find the wisdom to exploit it. This unfreezing of the geopolitical rigidities of the last forty-five years isonc. but only one of the elements shaping the global revolution. Entangled with many other forces of changes it has made the future shape of the world still more uncertain. Throughout the period since 1968 the world has lived under the shadow of the nuclear bomb. However with East and West willing to put an end to the cold war, a new climate is now dawning in international affairs despite the setbacks recorded at the beginning of 1991. Although nuclear annihilation no longer seems imminent, the threat has certainly not been banished; indeed it may exist as long as the planet is peopled by humans. Great vigilance is essential, not only with regard to the intentions and behaviour of the present nuclear powers, but also to curtail nuclear proliferation and to ensure that small nations now developing nuclear devices are persuaded or prevented from using them in local wars against neighbouring states. This requires a new strategy on a global scale, quite different from the bipolar approach of the cold war period. Humanity will have to be forever on guard against the rise of insane leaders with great charisma, capable of hypnotizing whole nations, and willing to destroy the world rather than go dewn in defeat. Such was the case in January. 1091. with the Gulf War Who can foretell the medium —to long — term consequences of the war on the environment as well as on the geopolitical balance in the Middle East? Despite present difficulties and contradictions, there is still hope for continued progress in disarmament negotiations concerning conventional arms and chemical and biological weapons. Wars on the world scale must be avoided; the power and sophistication of modern weapons make winning out of the queston and the high cost of their development and manufacture is a permanent burden, inhibiting economic and social development. Local wars Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10 • The First Global Revolution arc likely to continue to occur until some measure of overall global harmony is established. In the period under review, some fifty such wars have raged and there has been a considerable buildup of arms in the less developed countries, to the detriment of uSeir economic development. The economies of the industrialized nations benefit gready from the sale of arms. The business is highly competitive and contributes gready to increasing the threat o! war. Furthermore, the arms trade can easily boomerang and hit the nations supplying the arms, as has been the case in the Falklands and Gulf wars. The Utter, in particular, has highlighted the need to control the arms industry, both that operated by the governments themselves and that operated by private contractors, in the interest of humanity as a whole. It must be emphasized here that peace is not merely the absence of war, and that even without war conflicts will continue and will change in character; examples are trade wars, totalitarian regimes and economic colonialism. Inequitable distribution of resources is certainly one of the strongest and most Insidious triggers of conflict. Extensive disarmament—achieved or planned—should set free human and material resources, that can be used for more positive purposes, such as in restructuring the economies of eastern Europe, providing more investment in Africa and Latin America, and making possible environmental renewal. The process of disarmament, however, brings its own problems. For some countries, particularly the Soviet Union, the process is difficult on account of the need torehouse large numbers of discharged soldiers and to absorb them in a precarious and changing economy. As for redistribution of the sums saved, these can all too easily become uniden-jfiable within the finances of the national treasury, or indirectly come under the control of narrow vested interests.

Open compeoton, sometimes brutal, on both the international and the national scale has convinced not only political/ leaders, but also consumers, voters, and the community at large that the vitality of it is irreplaceable. Private business is considered to be its motor, profit to be necessary for investment and the financial market to be the inevitable meeting-point between savings and investment. The effectiveness of the market as a social institution for harnessing productive energies and meeting human needs is now universally acknowledged. But market mechanisms alone cannot cope with global problems that require a long-term strategic approach or involve distributional issues. They cannot by themselves solve problems related to energy, environment, fundamental research, or fairness. Only public intervention, based on political processes and often using market mechanisms as instruments of public policy, can deal with these problems. Market forces can have dangerous side effects because they are not founded on general interest. International financial speculation is a particularly eloquent example of the excesses caused by market forces, of people gripped by the madness of profit under any circumstances. Speculation has become a game that is unconnected with economic realities; it has escaped from the hands of men to be run by computer software and has reached new dimensions and velocity thanks to the information society. Some efforts - still modest, for the task is tremendous - are leading a first attack on the underground trafficking of goods through its financial manifestations: the money laundering for drag traffic or unauthorized arms sales, for instance, is being discovered by breaking the seal of secrecy on numbered bank accounts. Hopefully, such efforts will increase and lead to true International cooperation. We also cannot ignore geostrategic change.

However, Its immediate future Is clouded by the Immense deficit which, amazingly, the United States has allowed itself to accumulate In recent years. The development of the European Community, despite the years of hesitation, Is now gaining momentum, as its members see tangible economic and political advantages in cooperation and devise new mechanisms for its operations.

Indonesia or Malaysia, which are growing rapidly. Perhaps Australia and New Zealand, which have strong trading links with the other Pacific countries, may later find themselves in this grouping. Even at this early stage of development, the existence of these three blocs signifies an utterly different world pattern of trade and industry. These new blocs arc not restrictive, on the whole, to other trading countries, although they do have certain non tariff barriers and disguised protection. There Is much trade between the groups. In any event, what should be emphasized Is that there has been a very rapid development of technology and an increase in the speed of its application which has modified the relative strength of the different trade groups, especially that of the Japan/ASEAN group. This prospect has caused great concern in the other regions of the world. Latin America, close to the United States, but with a different ethos, Is particularly perplexed. While initiatives from its neighbour in the north are on the horizon, it is also stretching out towards Europe, with Spain playing a special role through its membership in the European Economic Community and other European multilateral agencies and councils. The Soviet Union, in disarray, is not yet in a position to deal with this situation. China, after the brutal events of 1080, remains an enigma, while impoverished Africa hardly appears on the world economic map. The South Asian region, dominated by the huge geographical and demographic bulk of India, has made some progress, but it is still uncertain whether it will be able to make the sort of economic breakthrough that has occurred in South East Asia. Here, population control is the key. Great care will have to be taken in forging the links between the evolving economic blocs and the countries still outside.

As these include most of the poorer countries, the new economic pattern necessitates a fundamentally different approach to the problem of overall development, including a conceptual switch from aid to partnership. The Gulf crisis may be a foretaste of many conflicts to come, not necessarily only in the form of North-South confrontation, but related to resources which will include energy and food availability population pressures, and ethnic and religious animosities. In a pluralistic world with many cultural, ethnic and religious differences, acceptance of others is essential and will have to be manifested in both word and deed. It has to be appreciated that the Western rationalist view of world problems is difficult for many countries to accept and may at times be wrong. Indeed, the position in Iraq in 1991 represents a re)ection of Western values, largely supported by the Arab-Muslim public opinion. Conflicts in a world dominated by huge trade blocs are likely to be very different from those of today's world o: nation states Wars between countries within a bloc or between blocs are more likely to be economic than military. The role of the transnational corporations will probably become Increasingly important, since their activities and concerns would permeate all the blocs. The IntcnUpttuUnce of nations A further feature of the geopolitical scene is a belated recognition of the essentially global nature of many contemporary problems, which cannot be solved or even approached realistically by individual countries in isolation. This has long been the case in the economic field. One has only to remember how quickly the effects of the Wall Street crash in 1929 spread to cause a world depressionduring the thirties, and how mass unemployment tends to appear simultaneously in many countries. This global nature of problems is no doubt the inevitable consequence of the great expansion of world trade which this century hai witnessed. More recently, global problems of a different nature have arisen. These range from environmental Issues to Law of the Sea' negotiation* and inter national finance. Recognition of ibis new situation, awareness of which came very slowly, is illustrated by the mushrooming of intergovernmental conferences and those of specialized professional and scientific organizations during our period ol review. It is doubtful if present international structures are sufficiently equipped to deal with this new situation.

Concern about the global environment is giving rise to a number of ad foe enquiries at different levels, including that of Heads of Government. As yet such attempts are skirting the fundamental issues. It is hoped that common and universal action to combat such global problems will surmount inter bloc rivalry. This leads on to the consideration of the remarkable increase in the Interdependence of nations which our period has seen. The rise of economic communities, the need for a common approach to global issues, the immense expansion of International communications, and the activities of the transnational corporations are some of the contributory factors. In addition, the spread of technology and its services throughout the world, the need for common standards, codes of agreed practice, distribution of radio wavelengths and a thousand other technical agreements represent in their totality, a spreading web of interdependence and a k ftulo erosion of national sovereignty, which governments have not yet fully realized. The cult of sovereignty has become mankind's makx religion. Its God demands human sacrifice. Arnold Toynbee' The very concept of sovereignty proclaimed as sacrosanct by all govern­ ments has been challenged, and only partly because of the development of regional communities. Indeed, many smaller countries already have very little control over their own affairs because of decisions taken outside their territories, such as the establishment of commodity prices or Interest rates, or due to by economic policies modified to obtain IMF' funding. Erosion of sovereignty may be a positive move towards the new global system for most countries, in which the nation state will, in all probability, have diminishing significance. In the case of most of the sub-Saharan countries of Africa, however, me maintenance and even the reinforcement of sovereignty is essential in the present circumstances.

Here it is necessary to distinguish between a nation and a state. The African state may consist of a number of tribes which are. in reality, nations. A country such as Chac is politically a state, but is not likely to ever become a nation. The situation is further complicated by the fact that important nation-tribes may be distributed between several states. Recognition of the sovereignty of such states may therefore be necessary to encourage coherence and common identity, but it should lead to regional organization. In Latin America the notion of sovereignty is still strongly defended as a juridical defence against the great powers. A new concept has emerged as a consequence of artificially created states with nation peoples dispersed among different states: 'the right to interfere (for humanitarian reasons)' was recently put into practice on a French initiative, and soon after with United Nations' blessings, by France, tiic United Kingdom and die United States. It consisted of a humanitarian operation in Iraq in favour of the Kurdish people. Such a concept, if it were to be accepted in the future, would represent a considerable evolution In International law. which for once would be more a reflection of humanitarian considerations than of constitutional rules and nationalist seJ centredness The awakening of minorities and nationalism This brings us to apparent paradox in world political trends. On the one hand there is a tendency to create larger units, as in the case of the economic communities. Also, the resolution of the global problems demands action on a global scale. On the other hand, there is a widespread public dislike of what is seen as excessive centralization. The dominance of large, faceless bureaucracies which appear to disregard the needs of individuals and of local communities Is generally resented. The situation is particularly acute where such dominance impinges on the identity of erJinic minorities, and in an ever-increasing number of places ethnic groups are becoming vocal and active In their demands for autonomy or independence. In Europe, for example, the Catalans and the Scots are asserting their nationhood, while the Irish. Basques and Corsicans have resorted to violence. Yugoslavia, which is an uneasy federation of republics with different historical traditions and ethnic mixes, threatens to disintegrate. China, too, has great ethnic diversity, but perhaps the most remarkable of all is the situation In the Soviet Union, the most ethnically heterogenous of all federations, where die arrival of %\\awos\\ and pcialmia have led to separatist movements among a dozen or more republics.

This could ease the load on central governments and help to humanise the system. Urban growth Urban grewth has been a prominent feature of the modern era and is likely to continue as such. According to United Nations estimates, approximately 60 per cent of the world population will be living in towns at the end of the century, and there will be about thirty cities in the world with more than five million inhabitants, with the largest, Mexico City, having 24-26 million inhabitants. While this is a worldwide phenomenon, it is particularly marked in the developing countries where cities have mushroomed both due to a high birth rate in the dries themselves and an influx of peasants who have left the hind to exchange rural for urban poverty. It Is interesting to note that in London, the first city to have a population of one million inhabitants, more people died than were born until 1840. increase coming essentially from rural emigration. In the developing countries today, we see a reverse trend with internal growth being the main factor of increase. This indicates how gready sanitation and health have Improved, despite the very difficult living conditions of the urban poor.

All over the developing regions, patterns of settlement, and consequently lifestyles, are changing rapidly, and fairly large cities are springing up, often consisting mainly of a sprawl of shantytowns, completely lacking any adequate economic basis. In the Sahel region of Africa, for instance, towns such as Nouakchott, Bamako and Ouagadougou, until recently quiet administrative centres, have become vast urban slums with probably as many as a million inhabitants each, and with all the explosive economic and psychological tensions that such slums inevitably suffer from. The new patterns of jettlcment and excessively rapid urban expansion are partly the result also of high rates of population growth in the recent past. Development Throughout the period under review, great efforts have been made to speed up the development of the poorer countries, through massive programmes of aid. both bilateral and multilateral, capital and technical. A somewhat optimistic assessment of some aspects of these efforts was made by Mahbub Ul Haq 1 : Average life expectancy has increased by sixteen years, adult literacy by 40 per cent, per capita nutritional levels by over 20 per cent and child morality rates have been halved during this period, in fact, developing countries have achieved in the last thirty years the kind of real human progress that it took industrial countries nearly a century to accomplish. While the income gap between North and South is still very large - with the average income in the South being 6 per cent of that in the North - the human gaps have been closing fast: average life expectancy in the South Is by now 83 per cent of the Northern average level, adult literacy 66 per cent and nutritional level 85 per cent. It is true that the past record of the developing world is uneven, as between various regions and countries, and even within countries. It is also true that there is still a large unfinished agenda of human development—with one fourth of the people in developing countries still deprived of basic human needs, a minimum Income level and decent social services. But the overall policy conclusion is drat the development process does work, that international development cooperation has made a significant difference, and that the remaining agenda of human development should be manageable in the 1990s if development priorities are properly chosen. 1.

Hunger, malnutrition, disease and poverty still afflict a large proportion of humanity and are aggravated by the population explosion, droughts and many local wars. The purchase of arms by many of the poorer countries from the industrialized nations not only represents a huge economic burden, but also encourages militarism. The arms trade, in effect, produces a considerable flow of wealth from the poor to the rich countries. A number of leading developing countries have also built up an increasingly important arms industry, partly for export purposes. Scientific and technological advances in the industrialized countries tend to increase the economic disparities between uSe rich and the poor countries and to inhibit the latter from undertaking technological innovations. Thus the poor countries, lacking Industrial, technological and scientific structures and trained managerial capacity, have been unable to assimilate much of the technology and know-how available to them. Technology transfer was assumed to be the obvious method of introducing new processes and new industries into the less developed countries, but it has often failed — sometimes as a result of selecting inappropriate processes or unsuitable industries and sometimes, with the transfer of state-of-the-art-technology, because of insufficient preparation and absence of management, maintenance and marketing skills in the receiving country. Often new technologies have been introduced for import substitution wheh have not achieved the high standards wfiich are necessary to ensure international competitiveness. Too much importance has been given to large-scale and sometimes dramatic schemes, for example the buildng of large dams to provide hydroelectric power and make possible extensive irrigation faciliues. All too often the dam reservoirs have silted up and the irrigation water has become saline, while there has been little complementary industrial development and no rural electrification networks to convey the power to consumers. Also, in the design of such schemes, too little attention has been given to social factors. Including the displacement of large populations, the loss of acres of fertile soil flooded in the reservoir area, and the spread of bllharziasis via the irrigation channels. Particularly in Africa, the fragmentation of the continent into too many small and economically unviable countries, each possessing markets which are too small, has limited the value of large scale projects. In agriculture, the Green Revolution has registered considerable success, with the intioduction of new and high yielding varieties of wheat, maize and rice and the intensive use of nitrogenous fertilizers especially in India and other Asian countries and in Mexico where the new farm technology was applied. This has enabled India to move rapidly frcm a food deficit situation to a Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"A Whtriwind of Change • 19 situation of marginal surplus. But here again there have been unfortunate social consequences. The system favours the medium and large-scale farmer and has thus led to the displacement of peasant-farmers and the migration from rural areas to the cities. The energy-Intensive nature of Green Revolution agriculture may also cause financial difficulties for fanners as oil prices continue to rise. In other parts of the world and, once again especially in many African countries and In Latin America, insufficient attention has been paid to agricultural development. Frequent droughts, growing numbers of human beings and animals, and local wars or internal conflicts have led to the erosion of the resource base and marginalized large numbers of the rural poor. This again has deprived many people of rheir land and caused the rapid growth of the cities. It is In urban areas that discontent and insurrection flare up so easily and hence governments have yielded to the temptation of according priority to the allocation of scarce resources to protects of visible benefit to city- dwellers. As a result of the low priority given to agriculture in many African and Latin American countries, these continents are likely to continue facing a considerable food deficit for many years to come. A further myth of development lore is that the benefits of economic development trickle down from the rich to the poor. This is also a questionable theory. In India, for example, while, the Green Revolution has provided food in plenty, there Is little evidence of a commensurate diminution of hunger, malnutrition and poverty in rural areas. It has been customary in recent decades to classify the countries of the world into three categories —the First World of the industrialized market economy countries, the Second World of the state economy Marxist world and the Third World of the less developed countries. With the virtual collapse of the state-controlled economics, this category now has little relevance and needs to be cast away, while the concept of the Third World has already become almost meaningless because of the great diversity of economic conditions 1 and potentialities that the term embraces. To bunch together Saudi Arabia and Singapore, or Brazil, Botswana and Bangladesh is absurd, in that generalized statements of Third World problems have little or 1.

It is now more popular to refer to the developed countries as the North and the underdeveloped countries as the South. Despite the geographical anomaly of Including Australia in the North, this nomenclature makes more sense. The North South separation, however, hampers the new efforts to regard the problems of development in the regional as well as in the global context of the rapidly changing world economic system. Recent years have seen the growth of indebtedness in a number of countries. In the cases of Argentina. Brazil and Mexico this has reached dangerous proportions and while many lending agencies have written off their bad debts, and elsewhere some rescheduling has taken place, the debt situation remains grave, both for the development possibilities of the debtor countries and for the stability of the world financial system. In Africa, while Indebtedness is much lower in absolute terms than in Latin America, the debt-servicing burden is crippling. At a time when capital flow has turned to meet the needs of the East European countries, less developed debtor countries see little hope of an alleviation of their difficult situation. Most extraordinary of all is the fact that the United States has allowed Itself to acquire an internal debt of US$ J.2 trillion (1989), greater than that of any othrr country in the world. This remains a dark stormcloud on the econorr.ic horizon. The grave problems of world poverty, aggravated by population growth, could well give rise to great disharmony on a world scale, from which the industrial countries cannot hope to escape. It is in their own self-interest that the rich countries must take a new, poweiful and radically different approach to the problems of world development. With the metamorphosis of East Europe triggering the great demand for capital and for managerial and technological inflows, there is a real fear that the needs of the poor countries will be forgotten or relegated a still lower priority than at present. This would be dangerous not only for the poor countries, but for the world as a whole. The population explosion The problems of most of the developing countries are greatly exacerbated by the population explosion. World population, now just over 5 billion (from 1.8 billion in 1900) is expected to reach 6.2 billion in the year 2000, and over ,v5 billion in 2025, according to median UN projections. India's population, for example, would increase from 819 million now. to 1446 million, Nigeria's from 105 to J01 million, and Mexico's from 85 to 150 million.

In these circumstances it is difficult to see how the necessary food, housing, health care and educational facilities can be provided. Population growth is outstripping food production. In the years preceding the recent drought, grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was increasing by about 1.6 per cent per annum with population growing by 5.1 per cent, while in some countries which have the worst food shortages, per capita production has fallen by about 2 per cent per annum over the last decade. Furthermore, population growth Is providing an increasingly large workforce mainly in underdeveloped places where there is already acute unemployment, poverty, and extensive underemployment. The creation of millions of new jobs is indeed one of the most formidable tasks resulting from the population explosion.

A striking feature of the period under review is widespread alarm at the deterioration of botii the rural and the urban environment. Environmental pollution was a consequence of the Industrial Revolution and was well documented in nineteenth century literature, with Blake's dark Satanic mills' of industrial England, the pea-soup fogs and the dirty rivers. A degree of pollution control was gradually established in most countries through legislation, but heavy pollution of this sen persists in eastern Europe as the heritage of the Marxist economy. By 1968, however, a new concern had surfaced. Industry had become much more sophisticated. Its output had diversified enormously, with its products, by-products, and wastes, in many cases toxic and non-biodegradable, dispersed everywhere in the biosphere. In addition, the increase in world population and Its concentration in huge cities, as well as die massive consumption of goods and materials, was making it more and more difficult to dispose ol sewage and solid wastes. It had been assumed until recently that benevolent Nature would forever absorb and neutralize the waste products of society spewed into the air and deposited in the soil, die rivers and the oceans. This assumption no longer holds good; we appear to have crossed a critical dircshold, beyond which the human impact on the environment threatens to be destructive and possibly irreversible. Public concern was aroused by the publication of popular books such as Rachel Carsons' Silent Spring' and Schumacher's Small « beautiful 1 . By I9c$, reactions became vocal with conservationist movements appearing everywhere'. As public pressures grew in die Industrialized countries, governments took action. Environmental policies and environment ministries mushroomed and, since pollution Is no respecter of political boundaries, environmental issues reached the forums of International conferences. This resulted in much improvement; many of tiSe grosser kinds of pollution have been eliminated as i result of legislative action. The adoption of principles such as 'the polluter pays' has forced industry to accept a new social responsibility; rivers have been cleaned up and air pollution reduced, while everywhere local groups are vigilant with regard to 1.

Much can be done here on a local basis (for international as well as local results) by scrubbing flue gases, using low-sulphur oils and coals, and other means, but it is a costly and difficult business.

International action was obviously necessary to prevent further damage to the ozone layer, and subsequent efforts to achieve this suggest die type of international negotiation that will fce necessary in other and more complicated cases In future. The situation is essentially quite simple, since the number of chemical plants producing CFCs in the world is quite small. The Montreal Conference of 1989 succeeded in producing a general agreement on the nature of the problem and on its solution, namely the development and use of alternative propellants that are ozone- friendly.

This effect concerns the extent to which certain constituents of the atmosphere restrict the reflection of solar radiations from the surface of the earth into outer space, thus trapping the heat. The proportions of die main constituent gases of air. oxygen and nitrogen, seem to have remained constant during the past millenia. and all present life processes are regulated by this. However, other gases which exist in much smaller concentrations and were formerly referred to as 'trace gases\" control the greenhouse effect. Since the Industrial Revolution, the proportion of these gases in the atmosphere has Increased. The most important of these, carbon dioxide, has increased by 25 per cent, oxides of nitrogen by 19 per cent, and methane by 100 per cent. Other gases in the atmosphere, such as our notorious man-made CFCs. also add to the effect, as does terresdal ozone. Concern about die consequences of changes brought about by die greenhouse effect arose from observation of die increase In carbon dioxide concentration. The influence of the other trace gases was realized quite recendy. It was noticed that the proportion of carbon dioxide in die atmosphere has increased more since die Industrial Revolution dian in the previous sixteen thousand years, due to die combustion of fossil fuels such as oil and coal which are the basis of industrialization. This increase is also die result of a reduction In Nature's capacity to absorb the gas through photosynthesis, because of die extensive elimination of the tropical forests. A number of different and highly sophisticated global climatic models indicate that a doubling of the previous equilibrium concentration of carbon dioxide would result in an average increase in die surface temperature of die planet of between 1.5°C and 4.5°C. It is extremely difficult for the world public to appreciate that this invisible and apparently harmless gas which bubbles up from our whisky and soda or Coca Cola, and which we ourselves exhale, is a potential eliminator of our prosperity and lifestyles.

We must return briefly to the question of the elimination of tropical forests, which, in addition to its contribution to the greenhouse effect. Is to be decried for many other reasons. It generates local and regional climax changes, causes soil erosion and downstream flooding, and frequendy leaves soils which are unable to sustain agriculture. In the case of the Amazon Basin, especially, it involves the extinction of innumerable plant and animal species at a time when the preservation of gencticdivcrsity Is of immense importance. In addittan, it causes great human suffering and cultural loss as forest peoples are displaced or die out due to their inability to adjust to a new way of life. We must dlso mention die problem of die increasing scarcity of fuel wood in many countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The burning of wood and charcoal still remains the main domestic energy source for a high proportion of the rural population. The gathering of fuel is generally a woman's task. With demographic growth, accessible wood has become increasingly scarce and In some cases, a daily task which formerly took a couple of hours new demands six. Shortage of wood encourages rural populations to burn animal dung as fuel, thus leading to the lack of this natural fertilizer for crops and thereby to the deterioration of the soil In many tropical cities, fuel-wood has become exorbitant and households have turned to using kerosene for their domestic needs. This necessitates the expenditure of scarce foreign currency, as do changing food habits. As Lester Brown, the president of the World watch Institute, USA, puts It, many cities in the poorer countries are literally 'living from ship to mouth'.

Despite early fears, this has led to the growth of markets, increased employment, and die spread of prosperity. At first, these developments were mainly based on empirical invention. With the emergence of chemical and electrical industries, however, the main impulse to development has come from the discoveries in the scientific laboratories. The success of technological development and the role of the application of scientific methods in determining the outcome of the Second World War led postwar governments and their Industries to give massive resource support to scientific research and the application of its discoveries in technology. The lead time from scientific discovery, through applied research and technical development, to production is icng. Hence during the first part of the period under review we saw mainly improvements and novelties of a relatively traditional kind. Later, breakthroughs occurred and completely new types of technology appeared, especially from the discoveries made in solid state physics and molecular biology. The applications of the new, advanced technologies are now so widespread that we can only present a very superficial indication of their significance. The ubiquitous application of microelectronics is now obvious in factories, offices and shops. The silicon chip microprocessor with its low cost and extreme miniaturization, makes it possible to provide a brain and a memory to any piece of equipment devised by man. Furthermore, microelectronic techniques work well with many other types cf advanced technology such as holography, satellite use. liquid crystal technology, and glass- fibre optics. The results appear In an enormous variety of microelectronic devices and gadgets of ever increasing sophistication. Computers, when first developed during the World War II occupied whole rooms with bulky equipment. These are now miniaturized, much raster, more reliable, cheap and widely available. Microelectronics has penetrated deeply into industry at every stage, from design to packaging. Automation and robodzation are modifying industrial processes and structures, and are eliminating cangerous. dirty and repetitive tasks, creating the need for new skills and challenging educational and training traditions. And this is only a beginning: new generations of 'smart robots' are appearing which can see and feel; emphasis is shifting from improvement in line-production towards integrated systems of manufacture; new types of equipment are being devised tlvough mufuttnma. a combined approach which brings together electronic and advanced mechanical techniques. These advances are rapidly penetrating all sectors of the economy and constitute the basis of the post Industrial society. Whether these advances will be fuliy responsible for change or not depends on the evolution of many of the other changes we have described.

Refection of the Marxist system and conversion to a market economy is not easy. Not only must new structures be created, but entirely changed attitudes on the part of the workforce and management are necessary for adaptation to a competitive system. Guaranteed employment in the old system inevitably meant low productivity, while lack of incentive inhibited all innovation. Consequently these countries now find themselves burdened with debts, highly polluting factories with obsolete equipment, a shortage of capital, and a lack of modem management skills. Social and psychological adjustment will be necessary, for example, in fadng the unfamiliar situation of massive unemployment. Considerable external help will be needed, not only in the provision of capital, but also in the form of technical and managerial assistance and many other aspects of free market development. In the case of unified Germany, the Federal Republic will be able to furnish East Germany wiuS capital, managerial know how and training, but it is unlikely that the transformation of East Germany will be achieved without a great deal of individual anc social hardship. Hopes have been raised in eastern Europe about the prosperity that will flow from the adoption of the market economy. While these hopes are largely justified, at least in the long run, it is important that market forces should not be regarded as the only agents in the acquisition of a better life, and that their limits should be understood well, as mentioned earlier. Ideals should not be cast out indiscriminately; it is necessary to retain some of the more positive aspects of socialism. Otherwise there could be a backlash against capitalism.

The drug network, from the cultivator through die drug barons who operate chemical plants for refining drugs, to the couriers and distributors, is all pervasive and at times seems invulnerable. The human misery and disintegration caused by drugs is enormous and. as we are about to indicate, it spreads lethal diseases. The growth of this evil, which shows no sign of slowing down, has become a matter of deep concern, but there is great uncertainty a? to how to attack it. The final solution would be to reduce demand through treatment and education, but this is very difficult in view of the wide dispersion of drug takers. So attempu are being made to eliminate the power centres of the industry and to compensate the cultivators by allowing them to produce food crops. Finally we must point out the existence of the recendy discovered deadly disease known as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Triggered by the HIV virus, it is a sexually transmitted disease which Is also passed on by drug-users through contaminated needles. Furthermore, infected pregnant women have a very high chance of giving birth to babies who will carry and probably develop the virus. In the early stages of its history, the virus was transmitted to receivers of blood transfusions in which the donated blood had not been checked for the virus. An infected person may carry the virus for a number of years without any ill effects, but t then usually develops into AIDS, which attacks die immune system and causes death through one of many diseases which the patient, with a damaged immune system, is unable to fight. At present, progress has been made towards a cure and new treatments aimed at alleviation of suffering or extension of life are being tested with encouraging results. AIDS appears to have already reached pandemic proportions in some African countries and its global spread is gready feared. Apart from the mortality rate and terrible human suffering involved, the cost of treatment and of education campaigns is a great burden to these countries where it monopolizes hospital accommodation and diverts attention and effort from the cure or control of malaria, bilharzia and other debilitating disease*. At a time when medicine has made such extraordinary progress both in its therapeutic and preventive capacities. AIDS reminds us that in spite of all this progress, man remains vulnerable in the area of both physical and mental health. This deadly disease, against which vaccination is ineffective because of the mutation of certain viruses, demonstrates that at least for the time being, the permanent struggle for health, despite some wishful thinking, is as unavoidable a* death.

Some Areas of Acute Concern From out survey of recent global changes, it Is clear that there is considerable interaction between the various elements of the problematique. Population growth in a poor country, for instance, means that more food has to be grown, which in turn will put pressure on soil and water resources. If the food has to be imported, it means the diversion of scarce hard currency reserves from other areas of development. Again, a large population will have an impact on the environment, leading perhaps to the excessive cutting down of trees for fuel, with the social consequences that wc have described. This chapter will deal with some of the most urgent material problems which now appear to be threatening humanity, and especially that part of the problematicue, consisting of the intertwining factors of population, environment, food and, energy. The growth if human activity A central feature of the global situation is the enormous increase in the totality of human activity during the present century, which has necessarily led to a huge rise in the demand for raw materials and energy. Much of this increase is due, of course, to the spectacular growth of the world population during this period, whose numbers will be added to in the years to come by cohort after cohort of new inhabitants. Some people' argue that fertility has begun to decrease in all parts of the wotlci.

The issue is not whether fertility will go down, but when and at what rate. All die same, even if fertility were to slow down drastically, the demographic thrust contained in the age pyramid is such that population growth willcominue on its present course for many decades to come and this will require some audacious innovations in development strategics. There is an even more powerful factor responsible for the growth of human activity, namely the increased per capita consumption that economic Rrowth has made possible and which has reciprocally been the stimulus for that growth. As demonstrated by the proliferation of mass produced goods coming from the factories of the industrialized world, we live in a consumer society. In Europe, before the Industrial Revolution, per capita consumption was little different from that of many of the less developed countries today. Now the average per capita consumption o: materials and energy is about forty times greater in the North than in the less developed countries of the South. At itsextreme, the disparity may be more than 100:1. This is not only a reflection of social injustice, but an indication of the increase in our exploitation of Nature. Compounding population numbers with average per capita consumption gives a rough indication of the totality of human activity. We estimate thai this may have increased forty-fold during this century. Until now. consumption in the rich countries has been the main component of dlis burgeoning activity, but in the coming decades, the demographic component will become increasingly important. In this picture of resource consumption, we must point out die criminally wasteful use of human, material and energy resources used for military purposes, especially where such activities are a source of profit in some developed countries. It is difficult to understand how the people of the world have been willing to tolerate such waste in the face of hunger, poverty, disease ind underdevelopment, which themselves hreed war and violence, it is not easy to be precise as to the magnitude of resource consumption for military purposes. National financial expenditures on defence do, however, give some indication. The recent world total appears to have been about US Jl trillion in real terms, a four-fold increase since the end of the Second World War and a twenty-five-fold escalation since the beginning of the century. Figures alone do not convey the magnitude of waste, so some comparisons may be useful.

We can only hope that this wastage of resources will now be reduced considerably as a result of extensive disarmament—and that the savings will be put to constructive use, such at satisfying the essential needs of the underprivileged. Consideration of resource consumption and its disparities brings us to the concept of lustalnable development which was so dearly and optimistically expounded In the Brundtland Report' on environment and sustainable development, it is doubtful that a sustainable global development can be achieved w.ih the growth rate in the industrized countries increasing at the rate suggested in the report. A 'sustainable' society implies that the society is based on a long-term vision, in that it must foresee the consequences of Its diverse activities, and must ensure that they do not break the cycles of renewal; it has to be a society of conservation. It must avoid the adoption of mutually irreconcilable objectives. Equally it must be a society of social justice, because great disparities of wealth or privilege will breed destructive disharmony. In other words, the concept is uopian. but one that is well worth striving for. A sustainable society would never arise within a world economy which relied axlvsvtly on the operation of the market forces, important as these may be for the maintenance of vitality and creative Innovation. As we mentioned earlier, market forces respond uniquely to very short-term signals and are no lure guide to long-term considerations. Having accepted the concept of sustainability. there remains the question of the general level of material affluence that can be sustained, and the disparities between the rich and the poor—both within and between countries —which can be tolerated, taking into account social justice as well as practical realities. This is no plea for cgalitarianism; Indeed collective values in recent yean have preached a pseudo-egalitarianism which has Inevitably clashed with the realities of human nature. In seeking a normative approach to future world development in the present times of turbulence and change, it is vital to discover whether the present levels of material prosperity in the industrialized countries are compatible with global sustainability, or, more importantly, whether a world economy driven by stimulated consumer demand can continue for long.

Transitions may 01 may not be gradual, but In either case world food security Is threatened. It is also expected that there will be more changes In climatic conditions than in the past, with greater extremes in temperature and an increase In the frequency of hurricanes. Indeed, one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in predicting local and global climate change is the ettect that global warming will have on cloud coverage. The monsoon cloud system of the tropics, for example, is a main factor of world climate regulation and it is known that it reacts significantly to small changes in ocean temperature. A further consequence of the heating of die earth would be a rise in sea level, caused by the thermal expansion of the sea waters, and run off from land borne ice caps. This might mean a general rise in the sea level of as much as one metre, leading to the submersion of low lying regions and exposure of larger areas to the danger of flooding during spring tides and storms. The sea-level rise would, of course, take place gradually over the years, so there should be time for adjustment. The effect would virtually eliminate some groups of islands and greatly erode many important river deltas such as those of die Nile and the Ganga. widi the displacement of large populations. It Is interesting to, note that during the past hundred years, the global sea level has risen by 10-20 centimetres, while the mean surface air temperature has increased by about 0.5° Celsius. There arc. of course, many measures which can be taken to delay and buffer earth- heating and eventually to bring it to a halt. The fundamental step is the reduction of carbon dioxide emission by a massive reduction in the use of fossil fuels. The 1988 Toronto Conference of scientists suggested that it would be necessary to reduce carbon dioxide emission by approximately 20 per cert by the year 2005. A few valuable years of grace could be won through a worldwide campaign of energy conservation and efficiency. Some argue persuajively that an intensive attack on energy efficiency could itself solve the problem. However, even if this accomplished, the long lead time in the development of the new efficient processes makes it unlikely that exclusive reliance on such a policy would enable control of the warming quickly enough.

What then are our energy prospects? While there is a present glut of oil, we arc nearing the end of the long period during which this non renewable resource has been cheap and plentiful. Quite apart, then, from the need to reduce its use as primary fuel because of the greenhouse effect, measures should be gradually instituted to conserve this vital resource as a feedstock for the petrochemical Industry which will be required indefinitely for the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs and a host of other products now assumed to be essential. Coal is still available in plenty, but it seems as if it is becoming too dangerous to use because of earth warming, unless the technological progress currently taking place makes it possible to considerably limit its negative effects. Soft energy alternatives can no doubt be provided, but at the present rates of development they are unlikely to be available in sufficient quantities in time to supplement the reduced supply of fossil fuels. Present estimates suggest that soft energy sources may provide some 8-10 per cent of world energy needs at the end of the century. There appear to be good prospects for improvement in the efficiency of photo-voltaic cells, but the prospect of their covering vast areas of land, which would then be unusable for other activities, is hardly attractive The promise of nuclear fusion has been held out for many years as the eventual solution to all our energy problems, being virtually inexhaustible. This may prove to be true, but its abundant availability seems to be as far off as when the idea was first propounded. We certainly cannot rely on fusion to fill the gap if and when earth* warming forces us to reduce the use of fossil fuels. It appear: that we may have to prepare for a critical situation to arise a few decades ahead, when we are compelled by the dangers of earth-warming to drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels and have no alternative sources of energy in sight. In such circumstances, nuclear fission could be the only possible way of partially alleviating the situation. Many of us have been unhappy for a long time about the proliferation of nuclear power stations with their obvious dangers, as well as those of the disposal of nuclear waste, but we now reluctantly admit that the use of coal and oil is probably more dangerous to society than nuclear energy, because of the carbon dioxide It produces. There are. therefore, strong arguments for keeping the nuclear option open and for the development of fast breeder reactors. We must warn, however, that the adoption of this option could only partly provide a solution.

The impact of global warming could be particularly difficult for the poorer countries. Development demands energy for Industry and agriculture as well as for 'he domestic requirements of increasing populations. The type of situation which might arise is illustrated dramatically by the plans for the industrialization of China, the most populous country of the world. These are based on the use of coal, of which the country has large reserves, and would eventually make China one of the leading offenders amongst the countries of the world in terms of carbon dioxide pollution, at a time when industries in the rest of the world would be striving to drastically reduce Its emission. To force China or, for that matter, any developing country to halt its industrialization without compensation would be morally wrong, politically disastrous, and practically impossible. The Chinese experts are well aware of this problem, but the dilemma is not easy to resolve. Global food security Production of sufficient food to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing world population is obviously a matter of primary concern. In the early 1970s when the significance of the population explosion first received general attention, authoritative voices assured us that it should be possible to grow food for a world population as large as 20 billion. This is probably technically possible, if agiicukuic is loroidcicd in isolation. In the real wot Id. however, it lias to be considered in the context of the probleraatiquc. because of constraints due to other factors. For example, in die long term estimates of food produciion possibilities, it was assumed that water shortages could be overcome by desalination of brackish water or of sea water through technological innovations, which the pressure of demand would conjure up. This took no account of the enormous energy requirements which would be needed for such processes, nor of the availability of chat energy. Nevertheless, die increase in agricultural production since the end of die Second World War has been phenomenal and has led to a situation of considerable world surplus despite demographic growth. In 1987, it vas estimated diat world food production was sufficient to provide some 19 per cent more calorics than were necessary to provide a reasonable diet for every person on earth. Yet hunger and malnutrition persist in vast areas, worsened by drought, famine and warfare. It seems, therefore, that die production of enough food has little relevance to the persistence of hunger in the world.

But will the present patterns persist 1 The droughts of 1988 sent shock waves through the world food system. The drought in the United States appears to have been the most severe ever recorded, with grain production falling below domestic requirements for the first time. Food production in the US fell by il per cent and in Canada by 27 per cent. The deficits were made good by drawing from accumulated stocks, from which die terms of export contracts with about 3 hundred countries, that depend on food imports from North America, were also satisfied. This led to a dramatic fall in die total world food reserves. The question tiius arises as to what would happen if similar droughts were to occur frequently. It is premature to attribute the 1988 drought, which also affected many other parts of the world, to global warming, but the event was a clear warning of die vulnerability of food production to changes in climate. Until about 1950, increase in agricultural production came mainly from die extension of land under cultivation Thereafter, a massive Increase was achieved by die use of chemical fertilizers. Thus agriculture no longer depends solely on the availability of current solar energy, but now relies considerably on fossil fuels—the stored solar energy of past aeons. It takes approximately a ton of oil or its equivalent in natural gas to produce a ton of nitrogenous fertilizer. Petroleum is also necessary for the manufacture of weed killers and pesticides which are used extensively in modern agriculture, as well as for tillage and the operation of irrigation pumps. During the period 1950-86, the average per capita consumption of fertilizers, rose from 5 kilograms tc 26 kilograms while at die same time the area per capita devoted to the cultivation of cereals dropped from 0.24 hectare to 0.15 hectare.

Enormous amounts of fertile topsoil are washed away into the rivers by rain every year all over the wcrld. Intensive agricultural practices, such as those of the Green Revolution, demand a much greater use of water than do the traditional methods. As a result, ground water levels are falling In many areas, causing doubt as to the long-term sustainabllity of these practices.

This is. however, only one element m die approaching crisis in global water availability. Domestic demand for water increases rapidly as economic growth is achieved. In addition, many industrial technologies require vast amounts of water. Acute water problems are caused by the growth of the cities, especially those built in arid regions, unsuitable for large urban populations. Finally we must stress again the imminent danger of the contamination of aquifers by die diffusion of toxic and radioactive wastes. Special mention should be made of some of the distortions caused by die Infiltration of Western lifestyles and needs into some of the developing countries. In many places, and especially In die African cities, food habits have changed completely, pardy because of the availability of famine relief food supplies or low priced food Imports from Western countries. Thus bread has become popular in areas which are unsuitable for wheat farming, and rice is gready In favour despite die high water needs for its cultivation. This tendency is much to the detriment of traditional food crops and has reduced the incentive for local farmers to increase their production of these oops.

The population backlash The long-term consequences of demographic change are inextricably linked widi future world development arid harmony. The industrialized countries with their ageing populations should go some way towards maintaining living standards with a reduced work force, because of automation and die considerable increase in productivity that it will generate. However, the substantial increase in the number of elderly people will be a great burden on the pension funds and on die health and welfare systems. Some of these countries are turning to pro natalist policies, but. as yet. have met widi little success. Considerable structural adjustments will have lo be made in these countries because of the shrinking numbers in the educational institutions and the need for the extension cf health and welfare services for the elderly, the latter expense compensated for pardy by reduced expenditure on child health care. Although only a small proportion of the population will be within the formal teaming system, great efforts will have to be made to improve its quality: success in the post-industrial society will depend critically on the quality of human resource development.

The 'age-imbalance' problem can be regarded as a sign of success In family planning. It Is a temporary phenomenon and can be planned for in advance. In Sweden, where these problems were first recognized, the situation is now In control. For the less developed countries, the problems are quite die reverse. In most instances, the growth of the economy and the elimination of poverty will have to be the main objectives of developing economies. This means a type of growth that respects and is built on the traditional culture rather than being a slavish imitation of the materialist growth of the North, which would inevitably induce the same malaise from which the industrialized countries now suffer. Too great an increase in the population can be a fatal constraint on development. In many cases already, development plans are unrealistic because of insufficient attention being given to this factor. Here, however, we are more concerned about the progression of the North South demographic disparities. By the middle of the next century, inhabitants of the presendy industrialized countries will constitute well under 20 per cent of the world population. Is It feasible that in the future, the world will consist of a ghetto of rich nations, atmed with sophisticated weapons, protecting themselves against the vast multitudes of hungry, uneducated, unemployed and angry people outside? Such a scenario, which is a supposition based on present trends, is unlikely. World events whkh JIC unforeseeable now will surely intervene. For example, by that time, several less developed countries will no doubt possess their own nuclear weapons. It is more likely that population pressures, the lack of opportunities and conditions of tyranny and oppression will have generated waves of migration to the North and the West, which will be impossible to contain. Our successors are likely to see mass migrations on an unprecedented scale. Such movements have already begun, with the 'boat-people' migrating from the Far East. Mexicans slipping over the border into die United States, and Asians and Africans migrating to Europe. It is not difficult to imagine at a future date, innumerable hungry and desperate immigrants landing in their boats on the northern shores of the Mediterranean. Similarly, massive migration from Latin America to the United States is to be expected, while population pressure in China may cause spillovers into empty Siberia. As we have already suggested, the rising of the sea level as a result of the greenhouse effect could greatly increase migration pressures, for example In Bangladesh and Egypt. It is therefore urgently required that the economic conditions In the poor countries arc improved, and that at the same time effective means of population control arc introduced. We would like to stress that reductions In Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Some Areas of Acute Concern • 43 ctoiwmit disparity and aid to development of a wise aixJ cooperative character, rather than a mere humanitarian gesture should be of fundamental importance to the rich countries in their own interest. This is hardly understood by the general public in the industrialized countries and, until it is, the politicians are unlikely to act. Nevertheless, it is clear that no measures will effectively stop the migration trends. This could induce a sharp rise in defensive racism In the receiving countries and encourage the emergence of a scries of right wing dictators swept in by popular vote. Such situations must not be allowed to develop. It is therefore very important, to prepare the populations of the rich countries to accept this reality. The Information Society The emergence of the Information or Post Industrial Society has been one of the main agents of planetary change. If it is wisely guided and it's problems are tackled in time, this development can make possible many improvements in the human condition. We have already described the development of microelectronics and how its applications are penetrating every aspect of domestic and industrial life. Here we are concerned with its economic, social and political consequences. The information society is based on developments which took place mainly in the scientific and industrial laboratories of the countries of die North; inevitably the revolutionary applications of microelectronics have flooded the markets of the industrialized countries. Our discussion of the consequences, therefore, has a strongly 'Northern' flavour. Microelectronics have not yet made much of an impact in the developing countries. Nevertheless, these innovations arc of great significance for the development of die South. The rapid development of microelectronics brought about by die invention of the silicon chip, which can contain millions of integrated circuits, took place mainly in the United States and In Japan. In the former country, most of die research and development was undertaken in the laboratories of relatively small, sophisticated firms (Silicon Valley) under contracts from die US defence department and space agency. In Japan, it was made possible by cooperation between the large electrical enterprises and the government as part of an imaginative long-term strategy. The Europeans entered the field at a later stage and are making great, but possibly insufficient efforts to catch up. Competition in this area is particularly fierce. It must be stressed at the outset that the coming of the post industrial society does not mean that products in daily use, including fJiose of heavy industry, will become less necessary in future, as some facile public statements seem to Imply.

There will probably be less people commuting, as much of the work will be done at home on computers. They will probably aspire to the independence given by the automobile, but, even should cars be scarce and fuel expensive, public transport will necessitate the manufacture of buses, trains and ships. In the information society, industry will still flourish, but Its products will be provided by a much smaller proportion of the workforce than in the heyday of the industrial era. The majority will be in the information-handling industries and the service sector, a trend that is already well established. Technological development has had a strong Influence on the nature and behaviour of society ever since the shaping of the first flint or bone tools. The type of society we are living in today is the result of the Industrial Revolution, and the advanced technologies, which are already modifying lifestyles and creating new occupations, may have an even greater effect. The central promise of the information society through the widespread use of microelectronic devices In industry and the service sector, is increased manpower productivity. It should becone possible to provide all the requirements of a country—including those of industrial production, agriculture, defence, health, education and welfare—and an acceptable standard of living for everyone widi only a fraction of the physical effort expended today. No country will be able to ignore these developments or slow down their actualization. To do so would mean forgoing their potential benefits, as well as risking economic losses in international trade. But the extent, depth and unforeseeable social consequences of these developments make it necessary to look well beyond the present decade in an attempt to ensure their exploitation for the maximum benefit to all. If this is not done and developments are planned merely on the basis of medium-term gains and narrow vested interest, governments wll. try to absorb social and other consequences by marginal adjustments of existing social models and policies in an attempt to eliminate crisis situations when they become acute. It would be irresponsible to leave such developments, which may be of fundamental importance to the health of society, exclusively to the operation of the market forces with their inevitably short term signals. It is not possible at this stage to predict the consequences of these technological innovations with any accuracy, but some trends are already visible. In the information society, interdependence between countries will increase through the immediate visibility of information. It will lead to a greater complexity of institutions and societies.

There will be the means, far more effective than the best efforts of secret police, for the electronic control of everyone's activities by 'Big Brother' dictators and societies. Technological developments tend to increase the vulnerability of society and this is particularly so in the case of electronic devices. Power stations, oil refineries, nuclear reactors, communication centres, banking networks and data banks all have nerve centres which are of relatively easy access to those with the intent of sabotage or political terrorism; these activities are themselves becoming more dangerous as more sophisticated techniques become available. A computer 'virus' can spread rapidly through large systems and totally disrupt their operations. An expert electronic saboteur could penetrate and hopelessly disrupt the whole intematioral banking network. The deeper social and psychological consequences of the information society are still more difficult to discern. In a strongly technology-based culture, there will always be a dichotomy between those who understand Its workings and those who merely press the buttons. It is. of course, not necessary to understand electronic theory in order to enjoy television. But when the use of the microprocessor spreads to make 'black boxes' out of nearly all the equipment and artefacts of life, the sophisticated know-how of the few. who invent and design the new machines and create the software, will have soared beyond die comprehension of the majority. Then we may be faced with a sharp distinction between the minority who know and the majority who do not know. The emergence of a priesthood of scientists, technologists and technocrats is hardly desirable, and its prevention must be one of the objectives of educational reform. We come now to the area of controversy that dominates the discussion of the information society, namely the problem of employment'. The attainment of full employment is still seen as a major economic and social goal, but In Its consideration, the influence cf automation and technological change is seldom given much weight. There are those who argue that the future course of information technology and the automation it makes possible will follow the trends set by earlier innovations in creating new products, new industries, new markets and hence generating economic growth. This will provide* replacement employment for those laid off by industries with shrinking labour requirements. Others feel that the situation is inherendy different from earlier (ethnological developments and that we are likely to see economic growth 1. See Scruff and Frtcdhcro, 19S2.

This question must be considered, not only with regard to possible job redundancies, but also to the genera! malaise of industrial societies. In the industrialized countries, innumerable individuals find little satisfaction in their work, even though they have been liberated from die crude struggle for existence by the bounties of the welfare state. These people often give in to a sense of worthlessness — a feeling of being useless to society and to themselves. Dignity, self-respect and a sense of purpose are basic psychological needs which are difficult to provide in the industrial and urban milieu and this malaise would spread if large-scale unemployment were to arise. It Is evident that extensive automation in the manufacturing industry is bound to cause many redundancies, especially of unskilled manual workers. It Is equally clear that as the new technologies spread, new industries will appear, providing new jobs, many of which will demand new skills. The balance between these two movements Is the critical question. Over a long period it does seem certain, however, that the labour force required for the efficient operation of industry will be greatly reduced In size unless new markets can be found. Markets for many gcods In the affluent parts of the world are approaching saturation levels, so substantial expansion an only be expected if the population of the developing regions can provide a mass market for capital and consumer goods. This, unfortunately, seems improbable in die near future. One argument in favour of automation holds that the massive numbers of redundant workers from manufacturing industries would be mopped up by an expanding service sector. The analogy here is with the decline in the proportion of the active workforce engaged in agriculture in the advanced countries to as low as 4 per cent over the last two centuries. This was the result of a decrease in manpower employed on farms due to mechanization. But migration from the land did not cause unemployment as the growing industrial sector was able to absorb the rural unemployed. Historical analogies can be misleading when the circumstances are not exact parallels and that is the case with the present transition, because Industrial and service sectors are undergoing automation simultaneously. It is very improbable that the labour force laid off by industry can be absorbed by the service sector as It exists today. Rather, as me information society evolves, we must expect to see a gradual coming together of productive and service functions and a combination of these in the future occupations of the average individual.

It is suggested that, in (he future, the chief concern of the individual may be less unemployment as we have understood it in the past, but occupation in the larger sense. It will certainly include time spent in participating In the economic activities of sodety. for which each individual will be adequately paid, but will also consist of activities, self-chosen, which will provide personal fulfillment. Thus the occupation of the individual will have to be seen as including only a small proportion of intellectual or productive employment in the traditional sense. Presumably this main occupation will take up a much smaller part of life (later entry into the work force, shorter working hours, earlier retirement, periods off for further education and reorientation,) and together with one or several subsidiary occupations or crafts—educational, social, artistic or sporting— should provide individuals with enough work to interest them and enough leisure for relaxation. Such a situation will not develop on its own. if thousands of workers, especially thousands of young people, fine themselves unemployed and burdened with a seemingly endless leisure, they will be doomed to frustration. Their free time will be taken up at best with television viewing and playing football. More often the pollution of leisure' will be expressed in alcoholism, drug addiction, hooliganism and delinquency. A new approach will have to be created by society itself and will involve extensive changes in the educational system and in the distribution of wealth. The above scenario is not as improbable or as exaggerated as it may seem at first sight. If automation in offices and factories docs indeed create intractable problems of unemployment, and if the labour unions accept that they cannot reject the progress of automation In the face of International competition. negotiations will follow, resulting in an equitable distribution of work with shorter houis, and the provision of other means of occupation. Measures will have to be taken to provide socially desirable occupations on a voluntary basis. This will make the increasing extent of free time both creative and satisfying, and transform the Information society into the occupational society. Thus the industrialized world would be entering the golden age in which machines will work for us rather than dominate us.

However, although the advanced technologies are beginning to appear in the industries of countries such as India, Brazil and Mexico, they hardly exist in the poorer developing countries. This is indeed a classic example of how technological innovations inevitably favour those countries (hat are already advanced to the relative detriment of those at an earlier stage. In the absence of a substantial industrial Infrastructure and facilities for using science and technology, penetration of the advanced technologies is necessarily very slow. It has been suggested that rapid development in the South might be achieved by leap-frogging over the traditional stage of industrialization by saturating the developing countries with computers. We feel that such an approach is undesirable. Unemployment and underemployment are rife in these countries. The advanced technologies are not labour intensive and would create few jobs. They are. instead, capital intensive and capital is a scarce commodity in the South. Further, as these technologies are owned by the corporations of the North, such a scheme would induce a deep-seated tcchnologkal colonialism. Nevertheless, partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries must be greatly encouraged to make sure that the latter are not forced to industrialize, leading to the establishment of obsolete and uncompetitive economies. •  *  a  The problems of environment, energy, population, food availability and development form an interpenetrating complex within the problcmatique which is the source of present uncertainty about our future.

Thus what is needed is a simultaneous attack on all the elements within a coordinated world strategy. The success or failure of the first global revolution depends essentially on this. The conflicts of the coming years will arise out of this complex of issues. Some of these have already been mentioned. We shall only add one other example in relation to increasing scarcity of water.

The International Mismanagement of the World Economy Among the main areas of concern, the rapid changes in the world economy deserve special attention. This chapter provides a brief and selective overview of the main issues affecting the world eccnomy today, focusscd on key countries and groups of countries: USA, Japan, the European Community, the developing countries, and eastern and central Europe. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA There are radically different views about the state of the US economy, influenced by the relative importance given to different aspects of a complex situation. This explains in part why it has been so difficult for them to achieve action on problems, even those which are widely accepted to be serious ones such as the budget deficit. At first, there appear to be many positive elements: the US economy 1 has been growing steadily for seven years, now at an annual rate of around 2.9 per cent. Millions of jobs have been created, and unemployment (5.2 per cent) and inflation (4.5 per cent) are low GNP per capita is around USt 20,000. and the economy is running near capacity, at the rate of $ 4.13 trillion per year. From an electoral point of view, this is almost an ideal situation. However, there is deep concern throughout the world — and in the United States itself—about the conditions under which this situation has been achieved . and about whether it can be sustained. For our purposes, these concerns can be grouped around the following four main issues: I. The following figures for the United Sato and |apan are official 1«0 figures.

In spite ot repeated efforts and international commitments, the annual US budget deficit continues at about S 140 billion. The cumulative effect of this annual deficit Is now a national debt approaching S 3 trillion, having risen from approximately % 900 billion in 1981. Interest payments on this debt ate now a major item in the budget, and these are, of course, affected by increases in interest rates. In parallel with the growth of national debt, indebtedness has also increased in ocher sectors of the economy- households, business and banking. Business debt is some 30 per cent higher than normal in relation to GNP, while major banks are seriously affected, partly through leveraged buyouts and Third World loans. International .ndtbltdncn. Over the span of a few years, the United States has ceased to be the world's largest creditor, and become the world's largest debtor. The deficit on current account is approximately J120 billion per year, and the accumulated external debt is over $ 500 billion and rising steadily. The IMF expects that the current account deficit will worsen again next year, to around J140 billion. The dollar has weakened in the last few years, and the US internal deficit, coupled with the trade deficit, contributes to that process. The United States pays its 'external debt' in US dollars, which essentially means that t forces creditors to accept a currency that is steadily weakening. This may be good for US exports, but is damaging to holders of US assets, and is also damaging to countries thai earn a large proportion of their foreign exchange from exports of goods and services to the US. In addition, for the first time since 1958, the second quarter of 1988 showed a deficit on trade In services, thus adding to the payments neeccd to service this international debt. Such Imbalances are a fact of International economic life, but the scale and rate of growth of the US current account deficit is unprecedented. A substantial reorientation of the US economy will be necessary to correct It, and, ultimately, to create a level of surplus needed to service Its accumulated international obligations which could exceed i 1 trillion. Thus the trade deficit U in fact a very serious problem. However, ft is important to recognize that it is itself a symptom of other problems. Its prime causes are the subject of heated debates. For some time. It was considered to be primarily the result of a strong dollar. However, after the Plaza agreement and the decline of the dollar, its primary cause was considered to be an 'unlcvel playing field\", or unfair practices by US trading partners, particularly the Japanese. It is now increasingly recognized that the trade deficit is mainly the result of excess consumption in USA. financed by foreign borrowings, and a decline in the competitiveness of American goods and services.

There is a growing realization in the United States that the economic growth which made Americans feel good about themselves, has been accompanied by the accumulation of serious social and physical problems. While the drug problem is the focus of public concern, there is a substantial agenda of problems yet to be solved. Some of these, which will require attention and expenditure in due course are improving education to meet the needs of a competitive economy, problems of urban poverty and growing racial tension, health care, a decaying physical Infrastructure and environmental problems, toxic and nuclear pollution, and so on.

A substantial part of this expenditure serves to support the strategic objectives of the United States and its allies throughout the world. Now that USA is facing economic difficulties, and competing head-on with countries whose security It guarantees, three major questions have arisen. First, can USA afford to devote such enormous financial and human resources to its own miliary security at a time when urgent economic and social problems threaten its future? Second, why should USA continue to expend resources to improve the security of western Europe and [apan { which spends only slightly more than 1 per cent of its GNP on defence) now that they are in a position to afford more substantial defence expenditures themselves! Third, the forty-year confrontation with the Soviet Union has virtually ended. Is this not an opportunity to reduce defence expenditure and use the resources thus set free to strengthen the competitive base of the US economy and tackle accumulated social and environmental problems? There are no easy answers to these questions. They demonstrate the degree to which economic and security issues are intctlinked. A serious debate is now in progress, especially after the Gulf War. focussed on the underlying qucstiuii uf what constitutes ical security for the United States in the modem world. It Is no longer simply a matter of military power: it must surely consist of the need to maintain the economic and technological strength of the country, its political influence in the world, and the health of its relations with its allies.

It will become more and more difficult to generate discretionary resources, even for priority purposes such as the war on drugs, die improvement of education, or the stimulation of research, development and investment. The primary causes of the problems will therefore remain unresolved. Whatever proposals may be made for the international management of the world economy in the future, it should be a prior condition that the budget deficit and trade imbalances which confront the US economy today must be corrected. Otherwise, these will be a constant source of instability and tension, and a threat to world trade and monetary systems. They will also limit the effectiveness of the United States in world affairs at a time when its full participation will be badly needed. JAPAN The most significant shift in the balance of world economic power in recent years has been the emergen.:- or Upan as an economic superpower. The scale and speed of this change is sometimes hard to comprehend. From 1985 to 1987, Japan's total national assets rose irom USS 19.6 trillion to S4i.7 trillion. During this same three-year period, the total national assets of the United States climbed from USS 30.6 trillion to S J6.2 trillion. OECD 1 estimates that the Japanese surplus will be S *S billion in 1990. S *7 billion in 1W1. and S J6 billion in 1992. In comparison, the US deficit is estimated to come down from $ 110 billion in 1989 to S 60 billion in 1992. The international assets of (apan may well reach S 1 trillion in the mid-nineties. The Bank of Japan is now responsible for the world's largest cash reserves, of approximately USS 80 billion. As an actor in the world economic system. It is estimated that between January 1986 and June 1987 the Bank of Japan spent $ 57 billion to force the decline of the dollar. Further. Japan is now the largest provider of development assistance, at S10 billion annually, and is the second largest contributor to multilateral institutionssuch as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Japan has been providing a large part of the funds required each month to finance die US budget deficit through the purchase of Treasury bonds at the rate of about S10 billion per month. In addition.

Japan accounted for almost 19 per cent of US capital inflow in 1987. The long term interest rates have risen sharply in Japan, from 4.8 per cent in 1988 to a forecast 7.9 per cent in 1991 and 1992, while US rates have remained broadly stable at around 8.7 per cent and are now lower In real terms than in Japan. One reason is the determination of the Bank of |apan to wind back the wild inflation of asset prices while were supporting the expansion of bank lending. Japan has consistently emphasized research and development, applied mainly to manufacturing in the civilian sector. The proportion of Japan's GNP applied to R and D has almost doubled in ten years, from 2 per cent in 1980, to about i.5 per cent today. As an example of its vigorous technology, Japan introduces each year as many industrial robots as the rest of the world combined. The poli:ical and economic system of Japan has twice demonstrated its ability to agree on new objectives and to reorient the whole economy in a very short time: first in response to the oil shock of 1973, and more recendy, in an effort to reduce its trade surpluses under the pressure of its trading partners, Japan has begun to reorient its economy so as to increase domestic lomumpuun. This ability to reach a consensus, and to achieve actual change in the orientanon of the economy is an enormous asset for Japan in adapting to the increasing pace of change in the international economy. Financial institutions, corporations, unions, the education and research systems, and the government itself— all seem to be able to orchestrate their efforts to achieve broad national goals. This capacity to adapt, coupled with their present vast financial resources, a dynamic research and development system, and a high quality education system would seem to guarantee an even stronger economic sanding for Japan in the coming years.

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY In the early eighties, while the economies of the United States and Japan enjoyed rapid expansion, it was fashionable to refer to Eurosclerosls', which afflicted Europe with high unemployment and slow growth. In recent years however, this situation has changed dramatically, because of three main reasons. First, increasing world trade, particularly that resulting from US economic expansion, has provided a stimulus to the growth of European economies. Second, the new domestic economic policies adopted in most European countries have helped to improve economic performance. And third, the decision to establish a unified European market by 1W has already provided a substantial economic and psychological bcost to Europe. It is now the Europeans who 'feel good about themselves\". They are engaged in the process of European pfrcHnta, unthinkable only a few years ago, which is taking place at a rapid pace and with far reaching results. How has this change come about, and what are its implications? Pethaps the most important single cause of this change was die feeling that unless Europe took some major initiatives to improve its economic and technological performance, it was doomed to fall not only further behind the United States, but also, and more particularly, behind Japan. Europe is now on the move towards a unified market of over *20 million consumers in which there will be die relatively free movement of capital, labour, goods and services. This process is already under way, and most major corporations and banks are positioning themselves to take advantage of the new situation through investments, mergers and takeovers. Also, there has been a surge of investment in Europe by countries outside the community, particularly by Japan and the United States, so as to ensure that they are not subject to discrimination as outsiders to the European Community. This integration among the nations of Euiope is not a mere economic or technocratic matter. It has both historical and political significance. As the process of economic Integration progresses, important political decisions will be taken which will determine the future shape of the European Community, its institutions, and its internal and external policies. However, many of die most difficult issues still remain unresolved and the final outcome of this integration b by no means clear.

Apart from the United Kingdom, there is. at least provisionally, an agreement to work together to define a process for an eventual single currency. The rapid changes taking place in eastern Europe are so profound that their future role in shaping the European Community after 1W2 cannot be ignored. Among other influences, that of German reunification will transform the nature of Europe and its role in the future Whether the world economy will return to and maintain a higher rate of growth will depend to a considerable extent en the leadership, the policies, and the cooperation of the main economic powers—the European Community, Japan and the United States. New patterns of cooperation should be developed to meet the global challenges of the coming decades. THE DEVELOPING COUNTTUES From the point of view of the management of the world economy, the term 'developing countries' is inappropriate for operational purposes. This broad grouping now covers such a wide range of countries that a more precise term is needed. It is useful to analyse a number of key issues which will clarify the role of these countries in the international economic setup of the future. Three such issues are debt, poverty and development, and participation in the wsrld economy Many nthrr approaches are possihle. hur rhr analysis of these issues does lead to insights into the future course of action. Debt: The debt problem is no longer a threat to the international economic system given the provisions now made by the major banks and their reorientation away from lending to developing countries land In fact, the greatest risks for banks today are related to their domestic real estate lending) Rut debt remains a major domestic problem for the developing countries themselves, especially in Latin America 2nd Africa. In the last two years the Western leaders have finally recognized that there exists the problem of overlndebtedness. Consequently, they have agreed to allow easier debt terms for the poorer developing countries which are making efforts to improve their economic management (the so-called 'Toronto terms' agreed on in lv&Sl. Secondly, they have put in operation a scheme ;the Brady Plan} to reduce the debt burdens of the larger debtors such as Mexico and Brazil. These are major steps lorwaid, but they clearly need to be pursued with greater urgency and will need more resources than are currendy provided. The growth of the world economy as a whole was nearly 4 per cent in 1Q&S, but that of Latin America was only six-tenths of 1 per cent. During that year. Latin American debt actually fell slightly, from US*441 billion to S 426 billicn.

However, over the next twelve months till March 1989. the debt-service burden grew by $ 10 billion. simply as a result of a 3 per cent rise in international interest rates. The cost of debt service each year is influenced by interest rates and the value of the dollar, and. as is evident, both these are beyond the control of the countries concerned. This dangerously unstable situation does not seem to elicit the close attention which it utgendy deserves. The problem, if unattended, may well undermine the future prospects of the world economy for several reasons' First, a number of major US banks, although they have reduced their lending to developing countries are still carrying substantial amounts of developing country loans in relation to their capital. Second, since 1984. the developing countries have been transferring money to the developed countries, a 'net negative transfer' of repayments in excess of new lending. The amount of this transfer was over US* 50 billion in 1958. Compounding this problem, the total flow of direct foreign investment to developing countries has fallen from S 25 billion in 1982 to $ 13 billion in 19*7. Thus, at a time when the developing countries urgendy need resources, there is a substantial net flow of these from poor to rich countries and. in effect, die developed debtor countries, particularly the United States, are competing for resources with the developing countries. This is inequitable, and represents a tremendous waste ot human and economic potential. Indeed, thcabrupt decline of the economies of Latin America boomeranged and resulted in a substantial decline in exports and employment in USA. On its own, the indebtedness of the developing countries constitutes a serious and growing threat to the economic and political stability of the world, but the deb: problem must be seen in the context of the other serious trade and financial imbalances in the developed countries. In this perspective, the present international management of the world economy seems very inadequate, and the hopeful and reassuring prospects of steady economic growth seem doubtful. New resources will also be needed on a substantial scale to stimulate development at a time when there are new competing claims, for example from eastern Europe and from the countries directly affected by the Gulf crisis. It is also essential that the access of die debtor countries to the markets of the North be maintained and expanded. If protectionism increases in the North, this will greatly aggravate the debt problem, as it has in the past. Developing a viable approach to the debt and development problem will require a far more coherent linkage of policies and Institutions concerned with financial management (IMF), with Investment and development (the World Auteursrechtelijk beschermd rnateriaal"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"58 • The First Global Revolution Bank), and trade (UNCTAD 1 . CATP). This will be a challenge to the world community, demanding imaginative cooperative efforts by the United States. Europe and Japan. In spite of institutional reluctance, policy objectives and action in such interlinked fields as finance, debt management, investment, development policy, human resource development, trade, and environment. must be made more coherent. Poverty and daxiopmtnt: Another Issue, even more threatening to the world in the long term than debt, is that of population growth, poverty and a decline in the level of development in many countries of the South such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and Haiti. Perhaps inevitably, the attention of politicians, business leaders, intellectuals and the public in the developed countries is focusscd on issues that Immediately affect their welfare. The long term implications of the present trend in the world economy—increasingly divided and polarized between a small percentage of the rich (perhaps 30 per cent in 2025) and a much larger percentage of poor and underprivileged people-seem too far away to worry about, but they are not. Apart from ethical considerations. which seem to have a very limited motivational force, two implications are likely to become evident fairly soon. In a number of poor countries, governments will begin to respond to the intense pressure exerted on them by their populations, especially by the frustrated youth, which will increasingly be concentrated In vast cities. There is no reason to expect that they will act in accordance with the norms of behaviour established predominandy by Westerners when they laid the foundations of the International system forty years ago. After scores of United Nations resolutions. North-South dialogues and conferences, with few positive results, they may well decide to move towards confrontation. That this may be illogical or cosdy would be Irrelevant to the political realities at work. History offers many such examples. In these conditions, the comfortable assumptions of International studies would no longer apply At best, only the delicate network of international travel, health and security controls, diplomatic courtesies, business, and scientific contacts, and so on would be threatened. At worst, terrorism and conflict —with ensuing migration flows—would drastically increase, which would certainly attract the attention of the North. The pressure of a rapidly growing population on the world environment is already becoming all too evident. But the solution to this vexed question 1.

There Is now wide public awareness that the Earth is a single delicate system, that the destruction of the environment in the South threatens the North, and vice versa. In the environmental area, there are now the preconditions for International action. PflrtKipatwM in Ike world tanm§: The outline of the developed economics presented earlier in this chapter demonstrates the enormous potential of new technologies, management practices and public policies to promote a new surge of growth. But at the same time, the demand in diese powerful economies for the products of the developing countries is likely to diminish as a result of technological progress, automation, and their changing demo graphic structure. The shift from natural to synthetic products and new materials has continued, moreover, to weaken the markets for most basic products which still are the main exports and the source of earnings in foreign exchange for most developing countries. A number of developing countries, such as South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia. Brazil, and more recently Mexico, which are able to compete successfully, attract Investment, and generate a modem economic base, may effectively become full participants in the developed part of the world economy. In other countries, the modem part of a dual economy may develop strong links to the northern economies, unconnected to the rest of the country which continues with Its traditional economic practices. In any case, most developing countries are In need of access to modem technology and enhanced scientific and technological cooperation. For many poorer countries, and for the poorer parts of dual economies, the economic opportunities will be limited. Demand for their primary products from the Ncrth is unlikely to increase significantly, and they will probably be unable to develop a significant manufacturing base. Further, the advantage of cheap labour will diminish as automation In the Norm reduces labour content, and the potential of the 'knowledge revolution', of information and computer :echnology, telecommunications, etc., is likely to remain unrealized. This Is because the trained and educated manpower, the systems, and the infrastructure, on which such a revolution must be based, are lacking. Another critical aspect will be the growing competition for resources of all kinds — particularly energy, water and suitable land for living —as world population grows and environmental problems increase. The orderly Auteursrechtelijk beschermd rnateriaal"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"60 • The First Global Revolution distribution of such resources through the market price mechanism, or by government allocation, will come under increasing pressure as demands become more desperate. This issue will require urgent attention at the international level. It will be one of the necessary functions in future, on both practical and ethical grounds. In the absence of a significant new strategy for world development, the world economy is likely to become even more polarized and divided between the rich and the poor. Already, abojt l.J billion people, more than 20 per cent of world population, are seriously sick or malnourished, according to the World Health Organization. With this perspective, it is alarming to note that the aid performance of the developed countries may be deteriorating. Since 1970. their provision of aid has expanded broadly in line with their economic growth, i.e. at about 3 per cent per annum. While the aid growth fluctuates from year to year, the average for the past four years has been less than 2 per cent. In 1989 the amount was US$ 46.7, about 0.33 per cent of the GNPof the dveloped countries, down from an average of 0.35 per cent of the last twenty pears (the UN target is set at 0.75 per cent). Within this average, some countries have consistently maintained an aid level of around 1 per cent, while others remain well below the average. An increase in ODA (Official Development Aid) is particularly important for the poorest countries as they have very limited options available to promote their development. The improvement In relations between East and West now raises die possibility of a truly global effort. Over USS 1 trillion is now spent worldwide on armaments each year, including $ 200 billion spent by developing countries. Therefore, substantial human and monetary resources could gradually be released for development through the reduction of expenditure on arms throughout the world. New thinking is badly needed; to Ignore the issue will lead to disaster. Besides, simply promoting 'growth' throughout the developing world along the lines followed by the Western economies is not a viable strategy on environmental and other grounds. This most not become an excuse for stagnation: it is a reason for examining new approaches to development. THE SOVIET CNION AND EASTERN EUROPE Until quite recently, the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe did not play a substantial role in the world economy. Now the situation Is rapidly changing and their role will become increasingly important for the following main reasons. The success of ftiatrmka in the Soviet Union, and in those East European countries engaged in reform, depends to a certain extent on trade and Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Mismanagement of the World Economy • 61 technological cooperation with the West. As reform continues, die intensity of such cooperation will increase, and this will be of particular importance to western Europe, especially to the Federal Republic of Germany. Thus, the leaders of the seven western industrial countries, at their meeting in Paris, assigned a coordinating role to the European Commission in this area. The Soviet Union and the East European ccuntries, particularly Poland, arc facing enormous budgetary and financial difficulties. The budget deficit of the USSR for 19X8 amounted to 120 billion rubles, or about USS 190 billion at the official rate. There is a vast collection of problems to be solved and the benefits anticipated from petalroika have not yet begun to appear. From the consumer's point of view, the situation is in fact worse rhan before. In these circumstances, finance and investment from the West are of great importance Although It has entered into loan agreements, particularly with German banks, the Soviet Union seems reluctant to take up the credit now available. Poland, however, is urgendy seeking resources for immediate use. Two important issues arise. First, until die management of the economy in die USSR improves, will the additional financial resources from the West be effectively utilized? Second, until it is clear that reform will suceed. and that a reformed Soviet Union will not revert to its past policy of confrontation with die West, should the West provide support* This second issue is proving to be a divisive force in the West. West European countries emphasize die opportunity and need to encourage positive change, while some in the United States emphasize the risk, and need for caution. If USSR should decide to move much raster, even incurring substantial debts to accelerate economic growth through cooperation widi die West, this problem will become acute. Relatione iwlh\" japan: One of the certainties of international relations since the Second World War was that relations between USSR and Japan would not significantly improve for two reasons, japan's friendly relations with the United States had precluded good relations with the Soviet Union, during the period of Fair We<riensions Secondly, the vehement disagreement between japan and USSR over the Kurile Islands prevented any rapprochement. Bodi these considerations may no longer be important. At a time when East West tensions have lessened, and because of an increasingly strained relationship with die United States, japan may feel more inclined to improve its relations widi die Soviet Union, and die Soviet Union in turn may wish to strengthen its ties widi japan in order to benefit from Its financial and technological resources.

Beyond these specific instances, it must be noted that the policies and prospects of the Soviet Union and its allies are of immense Importance to the future of the world. For more tiian forty years, the rivalry and tension between East and West have soured international relations and obstructed growth and progress throughout the world. Whether this situation is already irreversible, and ftjeiiroiia will fail to fulfil expectations and this failure will result in a return to confrontation is beyond the scope of this report. But one conclusion is inescapable. Every effort must be made to consolidate the progress which has already been made, away from East-West confrontation. and towards a reduction In armaments. This will produce positive results throughout the world, for two reasons: first, and most evident, it will help to reduce tensions, and thereby reduce the resources expended on armaments. These resources will then become available for investment, and for the provision of desperately needed social services. Secondly, the reduction of tension, conflict, and the threat of war will provide an mportant moral and psychological boost to world morale. This should not be underestimated. It could create the conditions for constructive new Initiatives in which East and West could cooperate for the first time, mobilizing their energies to face global problems. This is perhaps the greatest single opportunity available at the present time to consolidate the progress which lias been made by mankind and to open new ways for future global cooperation.

Agreements on arms reduction are achievements far beyond anything that could have been imagined a decade ago and there is the expectation of much more to come. This clears the way for more serious attention to the other problems which in conjunction make up the 'predicament of mankind'. 1 The new spirit of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union has made possible a high degree of solidarity between the nations against aggression, as proved by the agreement of the UN Security Council and General Assembly to impose a world blockade on Iraq following its occupation of Kuwait in 1990. Cooperative efforts have led to progress in other areas, such as the IJW of the Seas Conference where delegates, after iengthy negotiations, agreed on many important issues and novel institutional measures. They endorsed the concept of the oceans as the 'common heritage of mankind'. This precedent has also been applied to Antarctica, the last and extremely fragile unexploited area of the planet, which otherwise would have been pillaged by the Industrial nations in their greed for new resources, leading to ecological disaster. There have been in recent years, encouraging signs of an increase in public awareness cf the dangers which face us, due nitially to the reports by groups such as the Club of Rome which were then promoted by the media. Worldwide public debate, the pressure of green lobbies, calamities such as the Chernobyl and Bhopal disasters have forced politicians to recognize the importance of a whole scries of new issues, and compelled industry to adopt at least a semblance of social and environmental responsibility. As a consequence of awakened awareness, new signs of responsibility and solidarity have appeared among the general public in the form of citizens groups, cooperatives and NGOs with a vast variety of aims and methods, concerned with local, national and world problems. Particularly impressive has been the response of many private and volunteer agencies to disasters in places which are far from their bases. Their contributions have been outstanding in a number of earthquake relief operations.

These are manifestations of change which ten years earlier would have been suppressed by military intervention. This type of bloodless revolution is a rare event in world history, and contrasts with the brutal crushing of popular will a few months earlier in China and the tragic events in Romania. Changes in Chile have been positive and there is a trend towards democracy in many other places. The recent ideological volte-face by the leader of Ethiopia is amazing and hopes now arise for settlements in Central America and even for the disappearance of apartheid in South Africa, despite the danger of civil war in that country.

The battle is not yet fully won. Male chauvinism persists, but it will pass with the generations. Two elements are of paramount importance if women are to contribute actively and constructively to social development. Firstly, society must both listen to and place confidence in women. In the male dominated and seemingly rational world of today, female intuition, versatility and innate common sense arc too often ignored — often at a heavy cost. Secondly, women will have to be given both financial and moral support by society. Such support needs to be flexible and sensitive to allow women to play a positive role in the shaping of society, without compromising their place at the heart of the family. In the West, this means flexible work patterns, comprehensive child care and equal opportunities. In die developing world this means extensive legal rights as well as political and financial support. In some countries, availability of credit for women for the first time has unleashed a wealth of initiative and creative activity.

The implosion of the Communist ideology that had dominated the greater part of the twentieth century was certainly spectacular, but It was by no means an isolated event. It coincided with the end of the \"American dream', which lost its credibility with the painful Vietnam war that deeply scarred the collective American conscience. The failure of the Chatitn$a.

These are human rights and democracy. We shall now analyse their strengths and limitations. During the past decade, the concept of human rights has been a mobilizing factor which became effective through its dissemination by the media and by word of mouth in the countries where such rights were disregarded or denied. When freedom was widely enjoyed in other countries, how could the people of some countries be deprived of it indefinitely' This is especially the case in countries such as Poland or Brazil where the Catholic Church, an ardent protagonist and supporter of human rights, has a strong influence. In some of the most totalitarian of countries, aspirations for freedom have been fulfilled in such a way that it seemed as if the pressure of values had reached critical point and exploded, overthrowing the oppressors. Through various processes and despite the painful cost of civil struggle, death and Imprisonment, this thirst for freedom was expressed by Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa. Vaclav Havel. Don Helder Camara. and Nelson Mandela, Just as in earlier years Mahatma Gandhi had paved the way. But freedom alone cannot reorganize a state, write a constitution, create a market and establish economic growth, rebuild industry and agriculture, or build a new social structure. It is a necessary and noble inspirational force, but is far from being an operating manual for a new government. This is why the concept of human rights simply initiates but cannot implement the process of democratization. This is where uSe question must be raised—what sort of democracy is required today and for what purpose? The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last two hundred years, but they appear now to be In a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation. It is hoped, with the newfound enthusiasm for democracy in the tecendy liberated countries, that people will not reproduce slavish copies of existing models that are unable to meet contemporary needs, The limits of democracy Democracy is not a panacea. It cannot organize everything and It is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely, sacrilegious though this may sound. In its present form, democracy s no longer well suited for uSe tasks ahead.

Generally speaking, informed dlsucssion on the main political, economic and social issues take place on radio and television rather than In Parliament, to the detriment of the latter. The activities of political parties are so Intensely focussed on election deadlines and party rivalries that they end up weakening the democracy they are supposed to serve This confrontational approach gives an impression that party needs come before national interest. Strategies and tacrjes seem more Important than objectives and often a constituency is neglected as soon as It is gained. With the current mode of operation. Western democracies are seeing their formal role decline and public opinion drifting away from elected representatives. However, the crisis in the contemporary democratic system must not be allowed to serve as an excuse for rejecting democracy. In the countries now opening up to freedom, democracy is being introduced in a situation which demands greatly changed attitudes and patterns of behaviour from citizens. These Inevitable problems of phasing in democracy are difficult to solve. But there is another, still more serious question. Democracy does not necessarily build the bridge between a colonial or nco-colonial economy or a centralized bureaucratic economy, and a market economy based on competition and capable of producing growth. Attitudes, market relations and managerial styles simply do not exist in a country experiencing a transitional situation such as the present, which because of sudden and unforeseen changes has been neither planned nor prepared for the necessary structures. If such a situation is allowed to continue for too long, it is probable that democracy will be made to seem responsible for the lagging economy, the scarcities and uncertainties. The very conceptof democracy could then be questioned and allow for the seizure of power by extremists of one sort or the other. Winston Churchill was right when he quipped, 'Democracy Is the worstof all systems, except for the rest.' Yet we must be aware of its erosion, its fragility and its limitations. When persons say 'It is obvious what must be done to improve our situation,' they seldom ask 'Why isn't it done dien?' And if they do ask, they will have to answer.' It is because we lack the (political) will or because of our habits, or because of shortsightedness, or politics and so on...' Our inability to indicate how to overcome these sources of inertia and resistance makes it clear that we are not at all sure about what must be done. We overlook (psychologically speaking, we deny) our Ignorance and instead say, that we lack the political will.

Have we gathered the necessary means and wisdom to make decisions on the scale required for the world problematique, taking into account the exigencies of time? There is an increasingly evident contradiction between the urgency of taking some decisions and the democratic process founded on procedures such as parliamentary debate, public debate, and negotiations with trade unions or professional organizabons. The obvious advantage of these procedures is the achievement of a consensus: the disadvantage lies in the time they take, especially at the international level. For indeed the difficulty is not only in the taking of decisions, but also in their implementation and evaluation. Time In these matters has acquired a deep ethical value. The costs of delay are monstrous in terms of human life and hardship as well as waste of resources. The slowness of decision taking In a democratic system is particularly damaging at the international level. When dictators attack and international policing is required, delays in taking decisions can mortally affect the lives of thousands of people. The problem then is to invent instruments of governance capable of coping with change without resorting to violence and maintaining the kind of peace which provides security, justice and fulfilling growth for individuals and societies alike. Not only have we to find better means of governance at national and international levels, but we also have to determine the characteristics of the capacity to govern. Global governance' in our vocabulary does not imply a global 'government', but rather the institutions set up for cooperation, coordination, and common action between durable sovereign states. The good and, for our purposes, encouraging news Is that: —people and nations are beginning to agree 'o take the next steps' together. (However, they arc carefully avoiding to agree on wfiij they are agreeing.); —they are reaching a consensus by practical procedures rather than by the formal voting of governmental representatives; —many International functions, especially those requiring the most foresight and operational flexibility, an be carried out through non governmental arrangements; —in many fields governments have come to realize that the effective deployment of their most cherished right, their sovereignty, requires that it be jwld with the sovereignty of other nations, in order to do things that none of them can do alone. In this seme, cooperation does not mean relinquishing sovereignty, but rather exerting it through joint action— instead of losing it or just not using it.

The growing complexity of the world and of its problems makes it necessary to have a complete grasp on tremendous amounts of information before coming to a decision. This immediately calls into question the quality of information, for it is in constant danger of rapid obsolescence and possible inaccuracy, or of being used lor outright propaganda. A second impediment to governance is caused by the increasing size and inertia of large bureaucracies that spread their tentacles around the centres of power and slow down or paralyze both decision making and implementation. Other crucial impediments consist of the lack oi education for competent citizenship and inadequate intergencrational understanding. Yet another difficulty arises from die lack of cooperation within the administration and its sectoral structures. If the different power centres do not learn to cooperate, and instead insist on acting in ignorance of or in opposition to one another, the resulting administrative sluggishness can provoke delays that can lead to inefficiency, wrong decisions and confrontation. So far, governance has operated by treating problems separately and in a vertical mode, I.e. field by field. Today the interaction between problems is monopoly of governments and their departments, working in a vacuum. outside of the framework of the problematique. This in turn demands leaden of a new kind, capable of treating problems :n both a horizontal and vertical mode. In the world that is emerging, decision making can no longer be the monopoly of governments and their departments, working in a vacuum. There is the need to bring many partners into the process —business and industrial organizations, research institutions, scientists, NCOs and private organizations-so that the widest possible experience and skill is made available. And, of course, enlightened public support, where the public is aware of die new needs and die possible consequences of decisions, would be essential. A i ynamic world needs an effective nervous system at the grassroots level, not only to ensure the widest range of inputs, but also to make the identification of every citizen with the common process of governance possible. In the present situation in the world, the lack of identification of the people with the processes of decision-making is expressed in the form of indifference, scepticism, or outright rejection of governments and political parties, which are seen as having little controlover the problems of our times. These attitudes are dearly indicated by a decreasing rate of participation in elections.

These new tribes constitute a global phenomenon. They are strongly attracted by consumerism without, for the most part, having financial access to it. Furthermore, their own future seems to offer nothing but an uncertain fight for survival in an inhospitable global sodety marked by gloomy perspectives such as brutal competition or the threat of unemployment As for their elders, many of them are inclined to return to their traditional cultural and religious roots, convinced, at least for the time being, that this will provide the only way out of a life of misery and despair. In fact, another aspect of this great transition is the felt need to go back to the ancient spiritual principles such as those of Islam or Catholicism, or to find solace In cults and pseudo religions. This is essentially a manifestation of the deep quest for the absolute, which is shared by so many human beings. However In many cases, this need develops into fundamentalism and fanaticism, which is usually an expression of the immense disappointment felt W)M* the Western model of modernization, consumption, economic growth and social progress, which has not kept Its promise in most developing countries, and has brought dchumanization in the Industrialized regions.

Not only has little progress been observed in the field, but we must also acknowledge that poverty, famine and malnutrition have continued to increase in a great many countries in the South. An analogous phenomenon has been observed more recently where environmental problems are concerned, involving an incredible multiplication factor. Without being totally exempt from criticism in this context itself, the Club of Rome noticed that there was no progress from one meeting to the next, with some meetings yielding often debatable and sometimes even mediocre results. It was thus felt that it was no longer acceptable, at least as far as the Club was concerned, to speak of the probxmatique without formulating plans and procedures that would solve the problems set forth and analysed. The global approach to problems as required by the problematique implies a need for a corresponding approach with a glcbal perspective at every level of society to Interactive solutions destined to solve the problems.

Thus, even the partial liquidation of the arms industry brings many problems, and quick conversion of plants and of whole industries to the production of consumer and other civilian goods has to be considered urgently. In the USSR and China, large-scale demobilization and conversion efforts have been Initiated as a matter of national policy and directed, as expected, by the centre. In both these countries diere was an enormous scarcity of consumer goods, agricultural machinery, medical equipment. machine tools, and the like, so that conversion from arms production to the production of such goods was seen as highly desirable. Such endeavours have taker, place in conditions of minimal public accountability and economic chaos, giving little useful experience to countries with a market economy. It is certain, however, that the retraining of soldiers and armament workers to provide them with new skills and new attitudes is difficult and insufficient. Ir. contrast, in the Western market-economy countries, only Sweden has developed an active policy of conversion; most of the others have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Nevertheless die conversion issue is being discussed actively in most European countries, except in France despite the fact that much of its weapons manufacturing capacity mostly state-owned, is already lying idle. Conversion of arms plants to constructive civil uses is thus the currently accepted remedy, but in die industrialized countries this presents many difficulties. Existing lama-/aire attitudes assume that the market forces will take care of the transition. This may be so, but the major consequence is likely to be a lot of waste — resulting from abandened and unwanted plants and extensive unemployment. State-owned manufacturing facilities and contractors that have served the needs of the miliary for long are often incapable of handling new manufactures in a market environment. Grassroots action on the part of employees, trade unions, local communities, and so on, holds out seme hope in a few countries, but is unlikely to secure sufficient institutional backing in the absence of cleat governmental policies. Direct interventior, by the state it unlikely and would in any case be impractical because of bureaucratic rigidity. However, the state must play an active role, in view of the serious nature of the priority changes involved. The success of any comprehensive conversion scheme will depend heavily on the availability of extensive retraining facilities which only governments can provide.

The present historically significant situation of detente should be used to reveal and curtail the evils of the arms trade. In 19S6. the president of the Club of Rome, on the basis of a memorandum sent by Eduard Pestel to President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, put forward a proposal for the joint action of the two superpowers In limiting the sale of arms to the poorer countries. While there was only a formal acknowledgement from the White House, a personal and constructive reply was sent by Mr. Gorbachev, followed by a memorandum of further reflections on the suggestion. The correspondence was given full coverage by the press and television in USSR and Easi Europe, but was hardly noticed by the press in the West. It seems to us that the time Is ripe for the revival of this proposal, not only in the USA and USSR, but also in other major arms exporting countries. Recent events demonstrate the futility of the evil trade and how it can have a lethal backlash when the turn of events gives rise to unforeseen conflicts.

While this must continue, the main emphasis in the futuic must be in preventing the development of the macro-pollution which we have described earlier, to the level at which its effects are irreversible. By far the most urgent of these is global warming which threatens the world's economic and social system Prevention of global warming represents one of the greatest challenges which humanity has faced, and demands an international effort. Four lines of attack arc required: — reduction of rhe global emission of carbon dioxide, which will mean a reduction In the use of fossil fuels; — afforestation, especially in the tropics; — development of alternative sources of energy; — conservation of energy and the development of greater efficiency in its use. We shall base our discussion of the carbon dioxide situation on the Toronto changing atmosphere' target of reducing emission of this gas by 20 per cent by the year 2035. However, in view of the urgent need of the developing countries to provide energy for their citizens, and for agriculture and industries, the industrialized countries wi!l have to make even larger reductions in their use of fossil fuels — let us say JO per cent. Moreover, recent estimates Indicate that this is a very conservative figure. Initially, the highest priority must be given to energy conservation and efficiency in the transmission and use of energy in every sector of the economy. There are very large potential savings to be made which would, in any case, be economically useful and strategically necessary in view of the vulnerability of the Industrial countries to the cutting-off of oil supplies. In general, the market forces should be helpful here, but at present, incentives arc insufficient and will have to be increased. There arc also many non market barrers to energy conservation. In th? domestic sector, for example, the per capita consumption of energy in USA and Canada is approximately double that of the West European countries with an approximately equl valent standard of living.

Thi! alone can give us some breathing space before we face the more intractable problems of industrial adjustment. To be successful It will need a clearly expressed political will on the pan of governments and strong public support. Switching from oil and coal to other fuels has also been suggested. but apart from natural gas there are few alternatives which could be brought into use quickly. Natural gas has the advantage that in combustion the methane molecule produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy generated as compared to the longer chain hydrocarbons of oil and coal. Conversion to natural gas is relatively simple, so this may be a useful measure, although great care would have to be taken to prevent leakage, since methane is itself a greenhouse gas, being much more active molecule by molecule than carbon dioxide These arc. however, only palliatives or delaying measures. The fundamental issue is how to achieve 2 massive reduction in fossil fuel combustion in industry. It is frequently stated that the transition to the post industrial society will lead to considerable energy saving. It is true that the microelectronic technologies are nor energy intensive, and that their main applications are in the growing, important information sector, rather than in heavy industry where. however, through control techniques they an contribute greatly to energy efficiency. We have to remember, after all. that In an Information dominated society we shall still need heavy machinery, chemicals and other traditional manufactures. |ust as agricultural products were still needed after the Industrial Revolution had taken over. Reduction in the use of fossil fuel by industry, at least in the »l»ort and medium term, requires either considerable technological innovation, both in manufacturing methods and in the energy efficiency of those in present use. or else a drastic reduction in industrial activity. This last would necessitate a radical reorientation of the economy caking into account the intricate relationships of economic activity, ecology and technology. This is not a task which governments can be expected to perform effectively: it calls for new forms of government industry cooperation. Here the Japanese model may have something to teach the West. A number of European countries, notably Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, are already discussing these problems seriously and determining targets for their national contributions towards the reduction of the global carbon dioxide. Sweden, for example, has undertaken to maintain carbon dioxide emissions at tne 1988 level, while retaining its policy of phasing out nuclear power.

Coordinated efforts also exist at the international level and arc already being studied by the EEC. The social and economic consequences of a drastic cutting back of industrial activity are alarming and will be taken up later. The influence of the developing countries on the environment will increase rapidly with demographic and industrial growth, and they will have to share the burden of stabilizing the global climate. Development in these countries will inevitably increase the demand for energy and much of this an only be provided by fossil fuels. The Increased use of biomass through new biotechnologies is hoped for, but we must remember that this too generates carbon dioxide. Again increased numbers wil mean greater use of wood for domestic purposes, and the burning of wood has a greater greenhouse effect than that of coal. Energy efficiency Is thus of primary importance m the developing countries too. So far. industrialization in these countries has been modelled on the pattern established by the industrialized countries of the North. If things continue in tills way, the results will be disastrous for the countries In question and for the world as a whole. It is therefore Important that the improved cleaner technologies that the industrialized countries are striving for are made accessible to the developing world. Incentives given for their adoption, and aid offered in their implementation. So far we have concentrated on carbon dioxide, the classic greenhouse gas. but a whole range ot other minor components ot the atmosphere contribute about an equal extent to the greenhouse effect. Methane is one of the most important among these, and its origin requires much more research. Oxides of nitrogen are also critical. Their main source Is from agriculture, especially from the present excessive use of fertilizers. This also raises the question of energy use In agriculture, which has Increased greatly in recent decades. There Is a pressing need for the agricultural authorities to take up the question of making their industry much less energy intensive and of reverting to more organic systems. This is also desirable because oil prices, and hence the price of nitrogenous fertilizers, are likely to be much higher in the coming years.

Equally, an estimate of the probable Impact of these and other phenomena on the future climate of particular regions Is urgendy necessary.

It is necessary also to go back to first base and question the underlying assumption of most development policies, namely that the economic success of the prcsendy induitrialized countries, achieved through the systematic pursuit of a technology based economic growth, is the inevitable path that must be followed by all countries and all cultures.

A reversal of these trends, however, also implies radical change in the political systems, stability, elimination of corruption, a setting of priorities based on the needs of future generations, and strong limitations imposed on the uncontrolled spread of corrupt bureaucracies. In the semi industrialized countries, especially in those tliat became heavily indebted during the seventies and eighties, the adjustments that have had to be made to maintain the service of their external debt and to reduce inflation and waste, have forced them to cancel large projects, to redesign their strategics, and. particularly, to reduce me scope of. the public sector and provide strong incentives instead to domeidc private entrepreneurs. An important role can be played by direct foreign investment in this process. Many of these countries have had no alternative but to create conditions under which their Industries must become internationally competitive, following to sorr: extent uSe experience of the Pacific Rim countries. This process has sometimes been going on at the expense of the domestic market and with great sacrifice in terms of loss of employment and regular salaried incomes. We cannot ignore the fact that in many countries, especially in Africa south of the Sahara, too low a priority has been given to agricultural Improvement. This is due pardy to tnflated hopes of what might be achieved by industrialization and partly due to the fact thai industries arise mainly in or near cities and thus attract immediate attention.

Large numbers of small development projects in agriculture, health and education have sprung up in the poorest parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia, initiated by NGOs. independent organizations, farmers' groups, and village communities. According to estimates made in 1985, over one hundred ir.illion farmers were involved in development projects headed by one or several NGOs. The movement Is growing rapidly. Today.

Local savings, mostly made by women, are a fundamental investment for the future that should particularly be developed. Throughout all this, we can never overestimate die essential, irreplaceable role that women arc playing in development all over the world. NCOs and volunteer agencies have made a decisive and vital contribution, especially ir, the poorer regions of the world. There is no doubt that these actions will spread, for word about the villages that have come back to life gets around very quickly, reaching even the most distant villages in the desert, jungle or mountain. And villagers who were thought to be inert, fatalistic and resigned — when in fact they usually had no hope left and were too hungry to work — are beginning to believe that it can work for them too and are finding the will to improve their own lot and build a better future for their children. Priority must therefore be given in many places to small-scale projects, properly integrated into a global strategy. In addition, to avoid financial waste and the unwanted consequences of the large-scale projects we mentioned earlier. and to make the best of the lessons learnt from previous experience, it seems necessary to reverse the process that has been engaged in so tar and start favouring small - scale projects needing tar less investment and resulting in progress that is beneficial to the majority of people. At a time when financial resources are becoming even scarcer, the current situation demands that NGOs in die North, and the international agencies and financial ins:itution in particular, review the policies they have applied so far. Part of the investments planned for large-scale projects should be transferred to finance snail scale projects. The advantage of the latter is that they train the local men and women and set up the structures-village communities, farmers' associations — to launch a development based on the people's own needs and options, implemented with their active involvement and under their supervision. The replicability of the projects from village to village is starting to have a multiplying effect on the progress of development of groups of villages, then of regions. Beyond a certain stage of this kind of development, medium scale works like roads, markets, small hospitals, and schools become indispensable. Thus villages and NGOs have no choice - even though it may seem difficult—but to pursue action on these matters in a concerted movement on government policies. In the same way, home industries, small business firms or handicraft enterprises can be set up and give access to new productions and therefore new modest incomes.

This global vision of rural development bdscd on new perspective! and priorities requires full recognition by governments of the role of local initiatives and NCOs In fact, if a government decides to implement a rural development policy, this assumes that it has made essential political choices that must in many instances include land reform, population policy and development of small-sale health facilities. However, the recognition of the effectiveness of NGOs by governments has often remained rather theoretical. Again and again it has been observed how the results of small scale projects are compromised by the application of practices and even policies that are in contradiction to the type of development they stood for. Purchase prices for farm products do not sufficiently remunerate the farmers for their labour and discourage instead of encourage them to increase production. Similarly, direct and indirect taxes on the national level are bitterly felt in rural areas, where income is generally very low. Government taxation with its resulting financial burden could well slow down or put a stop lo all small-scale project efforts, however much external financial aid there is. When governments have decided to support this approach to rural development, they must then modify their political and financial options and adopt a policy of higher buying prices for village products, as well as relieve them of some of the tax pressure. Rural development based on small scale projects also demands that governments implement national planning policies favouring road construction and the development of intermediate settlements between villages and big towns. The absence of roads excludes a large number of village communities from normal trading and makes them live in a 'closed circuit'. Some of them have built roads or bridges themselves, but they are not equipped for such tasks, which should be planned on a national level and carried out on the systematic basis of a policy. Similar problems arise in the area of primary and secondary school education, hospitals, higher level training, and leisure activities for the young. Moreover, corruption must be fought at every level of the administration, and this implies, among other measures, the training of lower-level civil servants in order to motivate and involve them in a development policy that should be well understood as a national priority. We shall argue later that a major need in the development of the Soudi is the creation of an indigenous capacity in each country for research and development.

Moreover, we have to ask whether current conditions allow us to envisage successful international cooperation on the necessary scale. Two potential obstacles might bar the way. The first is political obstacles. Relaxation of tensions between East and West has pointed to the emergence of a new international climate and this process may continue, despite worrying signs of reactionary tendencies within the Soviet administration. This might slow down the democratization process or even take advantage of the present economic fiasco to re-emerge as a political force. The new climate raises expectations about East-West relations, but not necessarily about North South relations. Indeed, confrontation between East and West in the past often led to competicon in offering assistance to developing countries for political or trade-related advantage* However, an attitude verging on impatience has now become apparent among many economists and policy-makers in the industrialized world of the North. They seem to feel that while restructuring the former Eastern bloc is a practical proposition, development of the South remains an intractable problem. Furthermore, the Gulf War has given rise to increasing tension between North and South.

Governance attempts to apply at least a semblance of rationality to the Irrational. subjective, and often contradictory behaviour of politicians, economists and die rest of us. It is unwise to overgenerallze on the concepts of governance; different countries have different approaches as well as different problems. Nevertheless, predominandy Western ideas have stimulated economic growth and material progress In a large part of the world and have brought with them Western structures and concepts, now generally accepted, although with many variations and diverse interpretations.

In a very complex environment with instabilities and imbalances, as is the situation of humankind today, the feedback systems are so numerous and so intertwined that it is difficult to design them widiin a comprehensive model. It is even less possible to grasp such systems through common sense and intuition, or even to draw up an approximate mental image of them. The solution of problems within this complex system is therefore dificult. made all the more so because in many cases public acceptance of solutions is unlikely. What gives rise to this growth of complexity? We mention here a few of the factors operating on both the national and the international levels: (1) tile increased speed of technical, economic and demographic changes; {2) the increase in the number of actors in tiie systems to be governed, whether a big city, a country, the vast areas of the South, or humanity is a whole; (3) the increase in die number of sovereign states playing an active role in any given international system; (4) die extent of Interdependence between national societies over a wide range of matters such as transfer of knowledge, periodic or permanent migratory flows, cultural influences and economic exchange; [$) the coming into contact of heterogenous societies, differing in their cultures, values, political traditions, and standards of living; ^6) the erosion of national sovereignty.

As wjs inevitable, many of the agencies gradually began to cultivate their vested interests. Staff was recruited less on quality, than on assuring through quotas an equitable distribution of posts to each member country. At the same time the effectiveness of some of the main agencies was diminished by bureaucratization and polidcization. Attack on the complexity of the contemporary problems entails a double risk - that of excluding public opinion and elected representatives from the knowledge necessary for the understanding of a situation, as well as that of strengthening the influence of specialists and experts whose arcane knowledge is difficult for the decision makers to appraise and check. The complexity of the problems has been compounded by the number and complexity of the actors: political parties, trade unions, corporations, non governmental organizations, pressure groups of all kinds including informal groups which may be shortlived but nevertheless intense and effective In their mobilization on a particular issue. These various groups contribute to governance through their proposals and protests. Governance is no longer the monopoly of governments and inter governmental bodies, and its effectiveness will depend on the capacity of leaders to selectively include in their decision making process these new actors, who are in fact their partners in governance. The structurts, policies and procedures of governments Increasing obsolescence is thus a major characteristic of governance today. Its structure? are basic, designed more than a century ago to meet the needs of much simpler societies than the present ones. Some important Innovations have certainly taken place in the meantime, such as the emergence of universal suffrage, the evolution of the welfare state, and a recognition of human rights, but by and large change has been incremental or by way of an Improvement of the already existing structures. As the range of governmental intervention has increased. It has been accompanied by high costs, swollen bureaucracies and inefficiency. Here we shall mention only a few of the areas where major innovations in structure and attitudes are most urgendy required. One such area is the need for better mechanisms for the integration of sectoral policies in order to deal with the interaction of the problematlque.

A second area of difficulty concerns the conflict between long term and shortterrr, issues. This is a major endemic problem. The normal parliamentary cycle of four or five years between elections is a feature of democratic governance. The power game of party politics ensures that both administrations and opposition parties have to respond quickly to issues which are of immediate concern to the electorate, if they wish to retain or to win power at the next election. Thus governments, like individuals, tend to ignore problems that can be put off till tomorrow - in this case until after the next election. This has probably mattered little in the past, but in periods of rapid change such as the present, what formerly appeared as long-term tends to race Into the period just five to ten years ahead i.e. into the period of the next administration. As a consequence, the new government inherits a legacy of neglect: untackled problems come home to roost, become compounded and there is a descent into crisis government, a staggering from one emergency to the next - which range from dealing with monetary and social problems, balance of payments crises, unemployment, inflation, and so on. Each crisis is usually resolved by pasting paper over the cracks; remedial measures seldom reach the roots of the difficulty. Fundamental causes of difficulties, being long-term in their operation, are too easily ignored or go unidentified in favour of cosmetic measures of ephemeral effectiveness. A further critical area is that of the apprcpriate levels of decision ■ making. The current situation is somewhat a paradox. The complexity and highly technical nature of problems encourages the centralization of administration for their analysis and solution, since this would be difficult for regional . and provincial bodies to organize. Also the global coverage of so many problems which demand attention on the world scale. would seem to require centralized national decisions. At the same time there is an increasing clamour for decentralization, regional autonomy and greater participation of the individualcitizen in decisions which affect him closely. This tendency is being strongly reinforced at present by the demands for independence or autonomy of innumerable ethnic groups, as illustrated by the situation in Yugoslavia and the incredible secessionist tendencies in the Soviet Union. These two approaches are indeed two sides of the same coin, perhaps growing pains in the transition of the nation state towards some new kind of global system.

Finally, a few words about the bureaucracy. In many countries there i; general public criticism of the size and power of the bureaucracy which seem! to enjoy inventing petty restrictions to freedom and unnecessarily complicating the life of citizens. It is felt to be remote, unresponsive and unfeeling, made up of people with tenured jobs who revel in exercising their petty powers. No matter how intelligent and objective the Civil Service may be — and in many countries this is uncontroversial—it is a fact that its members are selected to provide stability and continuity as political administrations come and go. Hence they are seen to stand for the status quo. to be the apotheosis of inertia and resistance to change, especially radical change. In some Instances it Is felt that the faceless Civil Service is out of the control of its political masters and thus not accountable to the people. It is certainly very difficult for a minister to master all the details of his departmental activities, of which he has probably had no prior experience, while his officials, very efficient and well-informed, 'know at! the answers'. There is undoubtedly some truth in such criticism, but sometimes there may be a great deal of benefit for an inexperienced minister in the informed cautious advice of the official. The considerable extension of government responsibility in recent years, in so many aspects of life has inevitably led to an increase in the size of the bureaucracy, and in some instances such as defence, to the perpetuation of power and unsuitable policies. Internal policies may thus at times be responsible for creating dangerous and partly concealed vested interests. SOMF IMPORTANT ISSUES Having oudined some general thoughts on governance, we feel it necessary to discuss some aspects in more detail. Resistant* to change Governments seldom generate innovation. They react to pressure for change which arises from popular demands, either through the democratic process of elections or in the aftermath of a successful revolution.

In face of the gravity of die decisions that will have to be taken in die near future, artificially stimulated party rivalries. motivated by attempts to win popular votes at the next election and often not even based on real Ideological differences, could lead to disaster. There is an overwhelming need to establish a consensus between political parties claiming to be custodians of the national good, if we are to weather die many storms ahead. To this end it would be useful O bring together representatives of different parties in a non-political forum such as might be provided by the Club of Rome and similar bodies, for the discussion of specific issues. Government and the forces of the market In East Europe, abandonment of state-planned economies in favour of democracy and free-market economies has inevitably indicated die need for economic efficiency based on competition and incentive, i.e. to accept and operate the forces of the market. This has led to widespread euphoria m these countries which have assumed that this is the panacea for their economic ills. While we fully agree that these countries need to operate their economies on tiie basis of the market forces, we have already warned of die danger of relying exclusively on these forces. It Is dius necessary to discuss briefly die relationship between governments and the markets. The market is ill-adapted to deal with long term effects, inter-generational responsibilities and common property resources.

The system of the market economy is based on competition and is motivated by self-interest and ultimately by greed. In the absence of all restraints, the operation of die market forces could lead to exploitation, neglect of social needs, environmental destruction, and die unchecked consumption of resources essential for the future. However. society demands and industry and commerce accept that there has to be an agreed system of ethics, within which the market Is operated; the system is thus self-regulating to some extent.

At the same time governmental policies are necessary for the establishment of an economic climate conducive to the efficient functioning of the market within the country and for ensuring that its products are competitive in the international market Government strategies should also provide incentives for long term development, for example fiscal and other incentives, and should encourage industry to invest in scientific research and technological development aimed at long-term sustainablllty.

Close collaboration between the public and the private sectors has been established as a basis for long term technological development, particularly through publicly financed research programmes, with the wide participation of private enterprise. It is particularly important at the moment that those countries which are now moving vigorously from centrally planned to market oriented economies, should recognize the limitations as well as the benefits of die market economy. Humanity in Politics There is a need to introduce a new strain of humanity into politics. Recent years have seen a marked loss of confidence In political parties and personalities contempt for bureaucracy, voter abstention, and a general alienation from the establishment and society. This may be due partly to overccntraltzation, which depersonalizes the system, and partly to bureaucratic oppression. It is a symptom of deep malaise. Leaders and bureaucrats seem to have forgotten that politics (as economics) is concerned with people and Is meant to serve people. Until humanity and compassion permeate politics and politicians go beyond merely kissing babies during election campaigns, alienation will persist.

Programmes could then be set up in which the agencies could take part by contributing both finance and expertise, with some support from the centre where appropriate. Such a scheme would mean greater influence of the UN centre in the work of the specialist bodies, but this might not be a bad thing if it could be done with minimum bureaucratic interference and if the programmes were genuinely autonomous. New approaches arc also needed in the working of some of the Individual agencies. Intergovernmental organizations, just as governmental agencies on the national scale, are not the ideal locations for conducting research on this. They ran stimulate research, formulate problems, and provide for useful international discussions, but the lack of sufficient funds prevents them from undertaking research in depth. Their work is essentially catalytic. The vast number of topics which an organization such as Unesco has to examine makes it impossible to have a competent staff, expert in all the details of the subjects covered. Furthermore, areas of particular concern necessarily change, so that many matters that are in focus arc only tempotarily on the agenda, with the new points of attack requiring quite a different set of skills. This problem is dealt with by the use o: consultants in most agencies, but it seems more efficient to adopt a policy of delegating responsibility for particular studies to the most competent institutes in the world for each subject undertaken. Selection of competent individuals should be essentially on the basis of quality and there should be no question of applying the principle of the 'juste retour'. With such a system, the headquarters will have a staff consisting of the best-trained individuals with most wide-ranging interests, and contacts could be kept quite small. Finally we must mention the question of leadership, with especial reference to the high qualities looked for in the person who is the Secretary- General . This subject has been usefully discussed in a recent report of the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation. The UN Charter described the bolder of the post of Secretary-General as essentially die chief administrative officer of the organization, but it soon became obvious that important political mediation and leadership functions were inevitable. In the reformed and active United Nations of the future, the image of the Secretary General is vitally important. For millions of people throughout the world he personalizes what would otherwise be seen as yet another vast bureaucratic machine. This individual is required to possess almost superhuman qualities.

These then arc some of the desiderata. What about the present realities? Ac present, even in those countries where corruption in government is not rampant, the rewards of leadership, which in theory are those of serving society and the satisfaction of doing a good job, are in practice all too often enjoyment of power. Hence, those who present themselves for election, tend to be individuals with more than the average vanity and urge for power over others. These are hardly the criteria for the selection of the wisest people to guide the world through the difficulties of the revolution. As things are now. many people of high quality who have the potential to become national or world leaders avoid entering the political arena with all its vulgarity and back- biting and the paucity of its rewards to those for whom power Is not the primary consideration. Much attention is therefore required in the selection of our leaders. At present, this Is done by a survlvalof-the-fitlest process which tends to select persons who are overdy self seeking and at tines even willing to sacrifice the common good for their personal or party ambitions. The qualities which are essential for the attainment of high office arc thus frequently the very attributes which make the individual unfit for It.

It is difficult to see how this can be changed; It will certainly not happen from within the system, and there is therefore a need for wise Individuals without political ambition to point out these problems to the public. Political decisions arc seldom based on rational thinking. They are normally based. In each Individual case, on a complex mixture of Intuition, experience, personal and often unconscious motivations, and constraints of political dogma and expediency. This Is unlikely to change, but the process can be improved; better and more thoroughly analysed information can be made available, motivations can be more consciously recognized and thus modified. and expediency can be replaced if the system permits long term considerations.

They are: the learning challenge of education, the contribution of science and the new technologies, and die role of mass media.

Education is all this. even if the term may seem worn out from overuse. Indeed, the educational systems of most countries are undergoing a crisis and seldom satisfy existing needs. Wc now have to define other objectives and other priorities for education, as we are increasingly aware that the educational systems, the schools, the universities are only partly ensuriig what we call education, and that the family, die professional framework and many exher social cells arc, on various levels, playing the most important roles in education.

To cite an example, the quantity of scientific and technical publications in 1986 alone equalled and perhaps surpassed that of all scholars and experts from the remotest past up to World War II. How is such a flood of information to be sorted out? How is it to be transmitted? How can we select what is to be transmitted?

Learning how to adapt to charge has become one of the new primary objectives of education. From their very infancy, human beings begin to learn by acting, participating and experimenting, and not merely looking on passively. Even in early childhood, a human being is learning to be a protagonist rather than a spectator. It is through this active relationship with his human, natural and physical environment, and solely in this relationship, that a person's sense of independence, personality and creacvity will reach a high level of development. It should be remembered, tiiough. that to act positively does not imply the non observance of all rules or dSc rejection of restrictions. The education of every human being at any age must embrace uSe multiple functions that mark the learning process and guide it towards the immediate future, with the following objectives: —acquiring knowledge; —structuring intelligence and developing the critical faculties; —developing self-knowledge and awareness of one's gifts and limitations: —learning to overcome undesirable impulses and destructive behaviour; —permanently activating each person's creative and imaginative faculties: —learning to pay a responsible role in society; —learning to communicate with others; —helping people to prepare for and adapt to change; —enabling each person to acquire a global view of die world; —training people to become capable of solving problems.

The contribution of science and technology In the Industrialized countries of the North, society has been shaped by technology, their way of life has adapted itself to make full use of it, and prosperity has been built on it. Technology imported from the industrialized world is also being used in the urbanized areas of the South. At the same time, many of the problems of contemporary sodety have been caused directly or indirectly by technology or. more often, by its misuse. It is to be expected. therefore, that technology with its seminal partner science will be an essential clement of the resolutique.

Today we have enormously greater amounts of information and knowledge about man and the universe than our forefathers had. but there arc few sigm that human wisdom has increased significantly over the last five thousand years.

There is a second type of fundamental research increasingly pursued in industrialized regions, namely oriented fundamental research, which is an essential part of the input in the development of the most advanced technologies. Such research, while not expected to have direct practical application, is needed to identify areas of ignorance which have to be eliminated in the development of advanced technical processes. Such research may be carried out in the laboratories of corporations or under contract In universities. It can thus be a very useful link between industry and academia. Much research today Is of a directly applied nature, aimed at solving specific problems in industry, agriculture or the public services. It may be research in the natural sciences such as chemistry, physics and biology, or in economics and the behavioural sciences. Indeed, the complexity of so many contemporary problems demands a combined attack from several disciplines. Experience shows that In such multldisclplinaiy approaches, research workers from many sciences, natural and social, in dealing with a particular complex problem, soon acquire a degree of communication which transcends the boundaries between the disciplines. The cultivation of mulddlsclplinary research is urgently required by the resoludque. It is difficult to generate within the universities, since they are vertically organized into departments and faculties which often have little contact with each other. Applied research must be Intensified in the developing.countrics where it is already widely, if insufficiently, pursued in the agricultural sector. In such countries it is much less common in industry, since the small size and relatively low level of sophistication of firms makes it difficult to identify technical problems or to afford to employ scientists to solve them. Technological development is the essential, but only the initial step in industrial innovation. It consists of bringing together technical knowledge acquired through research or purchase, and to develop it through a chemical pilot plant or engineering prototype so as to be a reliable and effective manufacturing process, which is competitive in the market. The cost of the development phase is usually greater chan the cost of die research stage on which it is based.

First as already stressed. there is an immediate need for a massive campaign for energy conservation and efficiency. On the conservation side, the requiremen: is more for the application of well-understood techniques tiian for research. However, if this is to succeed there will have to be considerable changes in human habits, and this will entail new activities in die social sciences. There is. however, great scope for research aimed at improving efficiency in the generation, transmission and utilization of energy (for example, by using superconductors). in die design of new types of engines, in machines of a wide variety of types, and in chemical manufacture. Techniques of energy accounting need to be developed and applied. While die bulk of these effort! will have to be made in the cojntries of the North widi their energy-Intensive economics, die South with its increasing populations will face the same needs. It is encouraging to note die recognition of this in the recent \"Nairobi Declaration on Climatic Change' (May 1W0). Secondly, it will be necessary to give a very high priority to an international programme of research on alternative energy sources and similar work in individual countries. This should include nuclear fusion development, magnetonydrodynamlcs and die whole range of soft energies. Work should also be accelerated on the possibilities of a future hydrogen economy, die gas being produced by the decomposition of water by electrolytic or catalytic means. This is not an alternative energy but an energy transmission method for use in automobiles, aircraft, and so on. if oil becomes costly or is discouraged for earth-warming reasons. Beyond Wis. the search must go on for new. clean technologies and for ways to clean up traditional processes. In die chemical industry, for example, research could be directed towards improving methods of manufacture including research on new catalysts. Research in tills industry must also be aimed at finding ways to make toxic wastes harmless with minimum energy expenditure. Here, as in ouSer industries, research on recycling techniques is required. A further task for the chemical industry is to devise biodegradable plastics for packaging and other purposes.

Science: and iuhnoioa^ /or AevtUpmenl. Disparities between developed and developing countries in science and technology are even greater than in their economic levels. Some 95 per cent of the world's research and development is carried out In the industrialized countries. I: is also true that the poorer a country is. the greater will be the proportion of its scientists engaged In fundamental research. While the large developing countries such as Brazil. India and Mexico have an Infrastructure capable of supporting a significant extent of applied research and development In the rest of the developing world there is little applied research other than in agriculture. In such countries, a mere increase In the number of scientists is unlikely to influence economic growth; indeed it is more likely to increase the brain drain. This is because there is generally no employment for the scientists in the productive sectors. Science in these countries can only contribute significantly to development if it is intimately linked with the productive process. It is generally accepted that a major, and perhaps Ifu major need in the development ol the South is the creation of an indigenous capacity in each country for research and development. This was the main conclusion of the UN Conference on Science and Technology for Development held in Vienna in 1979, at which various financial and other mechanisms were devised to make this possible. After more than a decade, however, there is little to show. Yet the need remains to build this capacity if the developing countries are to enter the modem world economy. There is a vicious circle here. If productive capacity is to grow and hence if development Is to take place, a critical scientific and technological Infrastructure Is necessary. Yet such an infrastructure seems impossible to build unless it Is In symbiosis with the productive means. The means to overcome this impasse present a vital challenge to the countries concerned and to the international community. The rait of mass media The impact of mass media on public opinion and individuals no longer has to be demonstrated: a larger and larger part of humankind will henceforth be deeply influenced by the radio and television programmes it has access to.

In developing countries the phenomenon is even more recent and still of quite limited scope, which makes the study of the reactions in these countries more problematic. The reactions that have been recorded so far are for the most part critical when they arc not outright negative; the liTesponslblty of Journalists Is frequently criticized, as Is their subjectivity and their lack of professional ethics.

This is why it Is fitting to consider the question of the true power of mass media and of the role they now play and can play in future in the building of the new global society. The answer to these questions necessitates a dialogue with communication professional* with a view to finding out what role they are ready to assume, not only for a better comprehension by the public of the world problematique, but also of the rcsolutique. Experience has shown that the power Of the media often referred to is not Just an Impiesslon. There is no question about the reality of such power; consider, far example, die role played by transistor radios In Inciting the Algerian war of independence, or the pressure brought to bear by the press in the Watergate affair which led to the resignation of the president of the United States. The media also represent a balancing power in democracies by exposing political or financial scandals, as also by defending consumer interests. It is true that they are always in danger of being manipulated—whatever the political regime—due to political pressure, economic interests, disinformation procedures or even self-censorship. Mass media, especially television, have acquired considerable power over the last two decades; they have not, however, reached the level of maturity and responsibility which the exercise of juch power would require.

Motivations and Values We return once more to one of the main motifs of the contemporary scene, the dominant influence of technology in shaping our lives and society. Starting from the Industrial Revolution, wc have gradually adapted our aspirations and lifestyles to fit in with an ever more sophisticated and pervasive technology which has permitted the en|oymeni of what has been seen as material progress. This has. of course, increased the prosperity of a wide cross section of the population in the industrialized countries, while reducing poverty, improving health conditions, extending life expectancy, providing general. If not always appropriate, education, and introducing many social amenities. The recognition that technology has a determinative role in world development is relatively recent and, even today, the economic system which relies so heavily on technological solutions to problems, has not yet fully come to terms with it. It is still implicit in the thinking of many economists that technological developments arise from the interaction of economic forces and are, as it were, one of the muscles of Adam Smith's 'invisible hand'. There is no doubt much truth in this; however, more and more technological innovations originate from discoveries in the scientific laboratories and could not have been foreseen. Therefore, science is the autonomous force which gives rise to profit motivated technology, in creating new products and systems, and hence new demands. Despite the unwanted social and ecological side effects of technology, and a general suspicion of it as the creator of the nuclear bomb and of genetic manipulations, general expectations of an ever increasing affluence and more and more material possessions flowing from it persist within an economic system which is driven by the stimulation of consumer spending and credit Auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"146 • TheFint GMml&volmtim availability. The luxuries of yesterday become the necessities of today; planned obsolescence speeds up the turnover of goods; the wastes of society accumulate and are even more difficult to dispose of as scientific sophistication diffuses into everyday goods. There is. of course, die other side of the coin. Considerable amounts of wcaltii from economic growth have been diverted to the creation of social benefits—unemployment benefits, health services, education, and welfare measures to reduce poverty. In a number of countries, this process has been so strong that it has evolved to form the welfare state, which is beneficial but has psychological costs. For instance, it is felt by many that the welfare approach encourages an over-reliance on the state, with an unhealthy lowering of individual responsibility and Initiative. The paternalism of employers, that was resented so much by die trade unions, has been replaced by the paternalism of the state whose huge bureaucracies arc, in turn, regarded as distant, faceless and Impersonal. The materialistic technology based approach to development has penetrated into societies and cultures of all types, and even the most rigid fundamentalist cultures find It impossible to resist the promise of power and affluence which it appears to offer. The goal of material affluence seems to generate greed and selfishness. Not that these features have ever been absent In Individuals and societies, but they appear to be magnified by the shrinking of non-materialist values, and have become more apparent due 10 die disclosures of corruption, crime and financial scandals by the press.

In the behaviour of people and of states, even those with constitutionally guaranteed rights, morals are flouted and the law ignored or twisted to suit the convenience of the authorities. In so many relationships and areas of communication, the implicit trend is 'back to die jungle'. As already mentioned, people need to possess a sense of self respect if diey are to lead a iileot decent human dignity. This was understood well in many traditional societies, but it is very difficult to sustain In the whirlwind of change. As a consequence of the many cross continental migrations, people are faced with cultural contradictions, and often experience an identity crisis or arc demoralized. In Western societies with their shallow consumerism, 'I am what I own' or' I am what I do', the more fundamental aspects of life have shrunk in importance, including those of religion, ethnic identity, and inherited values and beliefs. Such a situation leads to hyper Individuality, selfishness of all kinds, over-consumption, as well as an excessive search for distraction, as for instance in TV viewing and drug addiction.

Moral values arc also being eroded, since they are flagrantly ignored by the individuals and societies for whom they are presumed to be the inspirational message. Lax behaviour, selfishness and materialism appear to have made them irrelevant. But people are troubled by such symptoms. Never before has the issue of values been the subject of so many symposia, discussions and so much research This demonstrates that a need is being expressed with increasing Intensity for a value system which would provide stability to the life of Individuals and society, and which would inspire the vision of a systematic world capable of leading to a systematic future. Does this mean that a new value system is in the making, which would be m opposition to traditional values or to the capacity of traditional values to take a stand on the new challenges, such as genetic engineering, that trouble human conscience and judgement? Can we speak today of universal human values that would be common to all the inhabitants of the planet, despite the diversity of their cultures? These questions are not easy to answer and yet they are what our future depends on: a global society can hardly be possible without being based on common or compatible values that will shape attitudes, the common determination to face up to challenges, the moral strength to respond to them and the management of change. We cannot want the emerging global society unless it is founded on the possibility of living together with the acceptance of differences and pluralism.

A new ethical vision such as this will necessarily have repercussions on the national level. In conclusion, the speed of evolution and of current changes leads us to consider that the time factor has an ethical value in itself. Every minute lost, every decision delayed means more deaths from starvation and malnutrition, means a further slide towards irreversible damage caused by pollution phenomena in die environment. No one will ever know for sure the human and financial cost of lost time. Once this has been recognized. the ethics of solidarity and of time leads to an ethics of action, where each citizen must feel concerned and mobilize himself for action. The isolated Individual always feels helpless amidst the immensity of the battle in which he is surprised to find himself. This should induce individuals to associate with others, and to find together the force and the effectiveness which they cannot muster alone. Collective ethics depend on the ethical behaviour of each individual in the group and It is obvious that inversely, die individual's adherence to a code of ethical behaviour can be encouraged, invited and aroused by die collective approach. How can different traditional and modern, collective and individual value systems co-exist both in a society and at the individual level? The emergence of certain universal values such as human rights or respect for nature does not mean the end of ancestral values even diough they may contradict each odier. In addition, individual values may at times conflict with collective values, or one value may conflict w.th another. A classic example of this conflict is the sale of arms, which is a source of profit for a nation and a source of employment for numerous men and women, yet is in opposition to tiSe same nation's desire for peace. The harmonious coexistence of very different values is nothing new, but it has been seriously undermined by the rise in fundamentalism. It is rather the relative importance attached to oSe values dut change according to the age of the ideology or religion in sway. As each person is biologically and socio- culturally unique, the emphasis should be on the individual aspect. 'Collective' values are often the outcome of a choice made—or worse, imposed—by those holding the reins of power, who want at all costs to die ethics of solidarity.

We also hope that the many, whose contacts with governance arc quite remote but whose future is deeply involved in the forthcoming changes, will begin to understand more clearly the significance of many of the topics presented here, such as the interdependence of the nations and the interaction of the problems. The time has come to show how every individual is more or less directly concerned with the problems of the world and the changes that are brewing, even if he or she can more easily perceive the symptoms than their causes. Even now. few remain untouched; one has only to mention the problems of co-existence with immigrants of different ethnic origin*, the effect on children and adolescents of certain television programmes, the internationalization of automobiles or the international spread of consumer products to arouse a variety of reactions.

The situation must be seen in local and personal terms. This is one reason for the need for a new, revitalized democracy, organized on a more participative basis, stimulated by die comprehension of global concerns. The need, then is 'to think globally and act locally' The Club of Rome has. since its establishment, realized the need for sjch an approach and there are a multitude of ways in which it could be achieved. We offer a few examples in die following pages. Global-Local Interaction On the Initiative of Maurice Strong 1 and the Club of Rome, a meeting was held in 1989 in Denver, widi some forty Colorado decision makers to discuss the following question: in what ways do the great world problems affect die economic and social life of die state of Colorado and :n what way can the political and economic leaders of die state exercise an influence on those great problems' During the work and discussions of the meeting, the necessity for joint action became more and more evident in a number of areas, especially on environmental issues.

If the individual is alone, the result will be merely symbolic. If a number of individuals pin to act In the direction of better environmental protection and if dieir influence tn the community strengthens their fight, then the result will be significant. The Denver meeting was followed by an open forum in which die ideas and conclusions of the small, restricted meeting were shared with a large audience of the general public. Similar meetings are being planned initially In Japan, and in odier countries, and similar approaches are being taken by other bodies and sometimes even by governments.

Further, we know a lot about some elements, but we understand very little. We have to learn, therefore, to act in spite of continuing uncertainty. Politics has always been the art of making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The difference today Is that the uncertainty Is much more and Is compounded with rapid change. This abiding uncertainty demands adaptation of our institutions and approaches in order to achieve greater flexibility and a great capacity for action as we train our sights on the moving targets of history. A central challenge in this connection Is hew to reconcile the language and concepts of economics that dominate the world today with environmental language and concepts. Two approaches are possible: environmental aspects can be added to conventional economic analysis, or economic approaches can be integrated within a broader ecological view. Great care and precise thinking are needed in this area, in which distinction must be made between different types of economics: macroeconomics, microeconomics, and environmental or ecological economics. We must find ways of integrating environmental aspects more effectively with the established and powerful approaches of both macro and microeconomics. The role of the market and its relation to the role of the government Is of vital importance in seeking to resolve and manage uSc environmental problems. No solutions based exclusively on the market exist in the real world. All Western countries, for example, have developed mixed economics in which governments provide a framework of regulations. Incentives, support and guidelines to the private sector. It has been acknowledged that the market approach alone cannot handle problems of common property resources or issues of long term common interest. The government must provide the boundary conditions In the public interest. The problems we face are not only intellectual and analytical; real interests and the structure of power are always at stake. In die real world, contradictory •ntcrefls arc inevitably operating. In establishing a normative approach, detinue arrangements for action have to be established between power groups and indeed between nations, which will continue to have different interests, values, norms and cultural traditions.

A fundamental upsurge of wisdom car probably only come through die inner development of the individual. The great religions in their purest aspirations have attempted to make this possible over the ages, with few outward signs of success. We cannot, therefore, expect miracles and have to construct a position of stability. This can only be based on the worldwide cultivation of an enlightened interest in the survival of the race and of human societies. This, in turn, can only be made possible by die universal understanding of the human predicament, its dangers and its promises. Mankind may have to choose between the two extreme alternatives of committing genocide or learning to live henceforth as a single family.

In The Firs'. Global Revolution, two members of the Council of the Club of Rome describe how material growth and over-consumption have now become a global problem. Environmental pollution, runaway population growth, food and energy shortages, and geopolitical upheavals make the future prospects of the world seem very bleak. What W3 are witnessing today is the emergence of the post- industrial society, and the tumultous changes around us are elements of this transitional phase. Poised on the brink of a social revolution ushered in by modern information technology, the world has two choices: • to continue pursuing material goals and selfish aims, and thereby cause the slow but sure decline of ail world systems: • to unite and work towards building an improved life for future generations. This book offers an overall perspective of the complex and interactive global problems, and discusses means of solving them comprehensively.
