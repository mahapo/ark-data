[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE PEGASUS FILE A former CIA deep-cover agent turns whistleblower at great risk. His shocking allegations expose powerful names controlling the international drug trade in very high places. V ietnam Special Forces Air Combat Contro ller; 25-year CIA deep-cover agent; US Army pilot flying classified missions during the US invasion of Grenada; Iran-Contra pilot flying cocaine shipments labeled as me dical supplies; and member of the ultra- secret, international G7-run Pegasus \"hit team\" ...this is the extraordinary story of Gene \"Chip\" Tatum. From sensitive, highly secretive (and hither to largely unknown) Special Forces covert operations in Cambodia, to wandering CIA a sset; through to \"black ops\" activities in Grenada and Oliver North's Iran-Contra \"Ent erprise\", as well as membership in an international \"hit team\", Gene \"Chip\" Tatum has seen it all, d one it all and is now telling it all. Tatum claims to know where the skeletons are buried. Above all, he is aware that his testimony implicates serving and former US Pr esidents plus a whole list of high-level government officials and others in a we lter of nefarious activities - including assassination, blackmail, coercion, gun -running, money-laundering and cocaine- trafficking. Tatum, a lanky Floridian, turned whistleblower following his arrest on treason charges in early 1995. The charge was both astonishing and patently ludicrous, and was later dropped and replaced by a fraud charge - a drastic step-down. Found guilty, he was sentenced to serve a 15-month sentence. In March 1996, an additional charge - conspiring to embezzle - was brought against him. Found guilty, he was incarcerated in Jesup Federal Correctional Facility, Georgia, wh ere he is serving a 27-month concurrent sentence. Ensuing press interest resulted in one article appearing in the Tampa Tribune on 4 May 1996. Many questions continue to hang over the c onduct of the trial. His defence lawyer refused to call any of the 80 witnesses whom Tatum nominated for the defence. Later, his lawyer freely confessed to having come unde r pressure from the US Department of Defense. Tatum says the fi rst charge was a set-up to discredit him following his \"resignation\" from \"Operation Pegasus\". Th e second charge he views with greater scepticism and concern. Tatum's resignation from Pegasus followed hi s refusal to \"neutralise\" a leading US political figure in the 1992 US presidentia l elections. Tatum declares he will not \"participate in assassinations of any sort , character assassinations or anything, of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"American citizens\". He goes on to explain that back in 1994, in a telephone conference call involving Oliver North, Fe lix Rodr√≠guez and the late W illiam Colby of the CIA, he was warned to turn over incriminating documents and tapes he had accumulated for his \"retirement\". He wryly observes that had he done so, he would probably have been quickly \"terminated\" in an \"extreme\" way - a speciality of the Pegasus team of which he was once a member. Countering this demand, Tatum volunteered to plead guilty on a fabricated felony count and serve a 12-month sentence - so that his cr edibility would be dama ged in the event he ever decided to speak out. His incarceration for the second charge - and especially the six- month sentence of his wife, Nancy - led him to speak out about his life, almost 30 years of which he served as a \"black\" opera tive, and to reveal a nd destroy the command structure of Pegasus. It is an extraordinary story. \"OPERATION RED ROCK\" Tatum has written of his early career in the military, and hi s involvement in a highly sensitive and classified operation, in an unpublished manuscript entitled \"Operation Red Rock\". Joining the Air Force in February 1970, he went through Army jump school, escape and evasion training, j ungle training, sea survival sc hool and diving school and was assigned along with six others as \"Comba t Controllers\" (the USAF equivalent of Special Forces), receiving his distinctive Sp ecial Forces burgundy-co loured beret. From there he was assigned to Tinke r Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and then on to Fort Bragg, North Carolina - home of the \"Green Berets\" - for training in C4 plastic explosives, mines, nuclear, biological and chemical warf are, plus indoctrina tion in electronic and psychological operations. Posted to South-East Asia as Airman First Class (A1C) in December 1970, he was assigned as a radio operator on a Forward Air Control (FAC) aircraft attached to Task Force Alpha at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. In short order he was recruited (an involuntary \"volunteer\") to \"Team Red Rock\". The team was composed of eight US Army Green Berets, three US Navy SEALs and two \"cowboys\" - a euphemism for CIA paramilitary specialists. With Tatum attached, Team Red Rock totalled 14 in all, and was about to be tasked with an operation th at came directly from the White House. In January 1971 the team received a final briefing from General Alexander Haig, who had flown in specially, along with CIA Sa igon Chief William Colby - nicknamed by the team as \"Mr Peepers\" because of his resemb lance to a well-known character in a TV sitcom. Haig and Colby outlined the plan, stressing its importance and extreme classification. President Nixon, desperate to quell domestic riots over an increasingly unpopular war, sought to withdraw all US pers onnel from South-East Asia. Withdrawal would - and, in the end, ultimately did - cause a military vacuum, quickly leading to the defeat of South Vietnamese forces."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"During those years, Nixon was also running a \"secret war\" in Cambodia and Laos. In Laos, a dwindling number of Meo tribesmen, together with covert US personnel employed by the CIA proprietary company, Air America, were battling against superior North Vietnamese ground forces. A much sim ilar pattern was occurring in Cambodia, amid grave fears that the \"domino theory\" woul d result if either of these two nations were to fall to the Communist No rth Vietnamese. Nixon hoped that native Cambodian forces could fill the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of US covert forces. Lon Nol, the Cambodian leader, stubbornly continued to resi st Nixon's diplomatic overtures to take up the slack, being anxious to hedge his bets and realistic about his chances of survival as Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces prepar ed to swarm in, unhindered by US air power. A plan had been drawn up at the highest le vels of Nixon's administration. Team Red Rock were to enter Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, in secret and attack the airport and military and civil installations, wreaking as much havoc as possible. The plan called for the team to parachute in to the outskirts of Phnom Penh, carrying captured NVA \"Sappers\" with them. Taken in unarmed and a live, the Sappers woul d be \"sacrificed\" and their bodies left to be discovered by Cambodi an forces. A furious Lon Nol would assume North Vietnam was to blame. It was hoped th at such an act would stiffen Lon Nol's backbone. With nowhere else to turn, the US puppet would urgently seek US hardware to strengthen his forces and continue the battle. The team members were not told that they, too, were to be sacrificed by their President to ensure that word of the operation never re ached the light of day. A detachment of Montagnard tribesmen (\"the Yards\"), in the pay of the CIA, was assigned to liquidate each member of the team and dispose of the bodies. The attack went successfully, but the team's suspicion of \"the Yards\" foiled the betrayal. Using their know ledge of \"escape and evasion\" tactics, the team decided to trek to the Vietnamese border and back to safety with US forces. 1 Casualties thinned out their numbers until only eight of them remained. Soon these, too, were captured by NVA regulars and underwent hi deous torture at the hands of Chinese and Russian interrogators. Ultimately, only Tatum and one other team member survived the ordeal. Convalescing, Tatum was debriefed by CIA stat ion chief, William Colby, and told he would, in future, be kept close to \"the Agen cy\". Recruited into the CIA, the yawning door of future \"black\" operations creaked open. Life would never be the same again for Chip Tatum. CIA DEEP-COVER AGENT For the next 10 years or so, Ta tum's covert activities were varied. For a while, he worked out of Homestead Air Force Base where he was NCIOC of the tower receiver sight and MARS station. This was the base which then-Pre sident Nixon used for his frequent visits"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to the Key Biscayne, Florida, \"White Hous e\". Much of this period remains obscured behind a thick blanket of classification. From there, he was stationed in northern Ital y, tasked with visiting the border towns of Yugoslavia and Italy. Colby felt that as a young Air Force man, Tatum might be \"approached\" in these towns for \"information\". The idea was to make contact with foreign agents and covertly gather informati on about them and their operations. Later, he was tasked with infiltrating Yugoslavia in order to gather intelligence on potential successors to the then Y ugoslavian President Tito. Tatum was also sent to search for missing US POWs from Vietnam and elsewhere in South-East Asia. By 1976, Tatum was operating out of Lamar, Colorado, in a communications facility called OLAB. His contact there was Don Holmes , president of Valley - a Savings & Loan bank. 2 Tatum acted as his courier, shuttli ng between Lamar and Springfield, Colorado, with transaction files. From there he was transferred to MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. Shortly before his MacDill posting, Tatum r eceived a call from Colby telling him he was resigning his position as Director, Central Intelligence, and recommending Tatum should deactivate his clandestine CIA activities. Co lby continued, saying that remaining active without Colby there to protect him might pl ace him in personal \"jeopardy\", as he had powerful enemies in Washington. This warn ing referred to Nixon, Kissinger and Haig, and Tatum's role in and survival from \"Operation Red Rock\". Tatum took good notice of the warning and became deactive. Later, in 1979, he requested and was granted entry into a USAF Reserve program. Leaving active military service he moved to Gunnison, Colorado, and took up a position with Bo Calloway, owner of the Crested Bute ski area. The appointment was arranged by Colby. During 1980 he received a visit from tw o men who informed him he was being reactivated, but into the US Ar my instead of the Air Force. He was sent to the US Army Flight School for rotary- wing training at Fort Rucker. From there he was assigned to the 160th Aviation Battalion/Special Forces at Fo rt Campbell, Kentucky. Shortly afterwards, the 160th combined with others to form Task Force 160. It was in this unit that Tatum played a \"s pooky\" role in the US invasion of Grenada. A photograph of him standing in front of his MD-500 Defe nder gunship on the beach-head in Grenada, appeared along with a feature story in the Louisville Courier-Journal . Tatum will only say of this episode that he \"wasn't th ere\", in the same sense that he \"wasn't in Cambodia\". At that time he was attached to the US Army 's 160th air wing at Fort Campbell. Not only was the Hughes helicopter then not in the Army 's inventory, but the 160th didn't officially exist. Jim Malone, of the Louisville Courier-Journal , finds this extraordinary. He has"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"documents showing the 160th was stationed at Fort Campbell, even though officials in the Pentagon continue to deny it - as they de ny the wing's role in Grenada. Malone, in a telephone conversation with this writer, advised that the 160th is now stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina - home of the famous Special Forces, the Green Berets. Their mission is to fly \"Delta teams\" on covert assignments, Malone added. THE CONTRA COCAINE TRAIN During 1983, Colby established contact agai n, advising Tatum he would shortly be contacted by \"a man called North\". This, as Tatum was to discover later, was none other than Lt Col. Oliver North - the central architect of America' s Nicaraguan Contra campaign. Besides fighting a covert war, No rth was also the link-man in much, much dirtier work. The \"Contragate\" years teem with well-documented acc ounts of illicit wholesale gun- running and dope-smuggling. The expos√© series published in Autumn 1996 by the San Jose Mercury-Post , entitled \"The Dark Alliance\", openly finger-points at the CIA and the Reagan administration for tu rning a blind eye to massive cocaine smuggling. Moreover, the series of articles claims that the explos ion of \"crack cocaine\" in Los Angeles resulted entirely from the Contra leaders-cum-dope peddlers who made vast personal fortunes from their activities. Today, the official argument remains that the Contras were \"freelancing\" without the knowledge or consen t of their CIA \"handlers\" or North's so- called \"Enterprise\". Despite th ese assertions, mountains of hard evidence point in a different direction. Included in this eviden ce is an entry from North's own diary which shows his knowledge of cocaine shipments. In stark contrast to these deni als, Tatum says that North's \"Enterprise\" not only set up the cocaine factories and \"ran\" the Colombia n cartels, but was also responsible for masterminding the massive shipments of narcot ics into the US. Significantly, he is not alone in making these accusations. A number of those involved in Col. North's operations have subsequently come forward and sp illed the beans. Almost all of these \"whistleblowers\" have been hounded and impris oned. Some have died, whilst others have fled. The whole Contra thing, Tatum states, wa s also being used by an extremely covert group called Pegasus. During February 1985, Tatum was piloting \"D ustoff\" (Medevac) flights for the US Army's 3/498th Medical Company, stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Two flight crews, including Tatum's, were tr ansferred to Palmerola Air Base, Honduras. Each flight consisted of a pilot, copilot, medic and crew chief. Once familiarised, they assumed the Medevac mission for Joint Task Force Bravo. Previously, in 1984, Ta tum infiltrated the 3/498th on the instructions of Lt Col. Oliver North who had establis hed contact under the code-name \"Jake\" (North ha d \"control\" of the 160th ai r wing and was also deeply involved with the tactical planning of \"bl ack ops\" missions in the Grenada invasion)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"On 15 February 1985, during a flight to La Ceib a, Honduras, he was instructed to contact his local \"handler\", Major Fe lix Rodr√≠guez - later to prove a major figure in the Iran- Contra investigation. Rodr√≠gu ez informed Tatum that in a ddition to his Army \"Medevac\" duties he was to support covert \"Pegasus\" missions. These, he was told, would take priority over his other dutie s. He was also given his \"chain of command\": three individuals, any of whom c ould authorise Pegasus missions. In addition to Oliver North and Felix Rodr√≠ guez, Tatum would henceforward take orders from Amiram Nir, a former Mossad agent a nd advisor to Vice Pres ident Bush. Aviation support for Pegasus missions operated out of Ilopango Air Base, Honduras (home of the CIA proprietary airline Corporate Air Servi ces) plus numerous Contra camps located in the jungles and mountains along the Honduras-Nicaragua border. 3 A common feature of all future Pegasus missions was the transport \"of large white cooler s in and out of the Contra camps\". On 26 February 1985, Tatum and his crew were instructed to fly two individuals to one of the larger Contra camps on the Honduran bor der. His flight log lis ts the names of the two individuals as Bill Cooper and Buzz Sawy er, both of whom worked for Corporate Air Services. Following a meeting between th e CIA agents and Contra leaders, Tatum was given a sealed cooler, marked \"Vacci ne\", weighing approximately 200 pounds, and instructed to deliver it to a USAF C-130 transport plane at La Mesa Airport, Honduras. Two crew members offloading the cooler a ccidentally dropped it, breaking the seal. Inside were over 100 bags of cocaine. Tatum re sealed the cooler a nd later watched as it was transferred aboard the C-130, outward bound for Panama. On his return to Palmerola Air Base, Hondur as, Tatum phoned Col. North to advise him of his discovery. North replied th at it was \"a trophy of war\" and that the \"Sandinistas are manufacturing cocaine and sell ing it to fund the military\". North closed the conversation by saying that \"the cocaine was bound for the world courts as evidence\" against the Sandinistas. The whole incident struck Tatum as odd a nd reminded him strongly of earlier missions dating back to 1983-84 when he was stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, as a Special Operations pilot. Regularly he would trans- ship white coolers, marked as \"Medical Supplies\", to Little Rock Air Force Base, Ar kansas. On two occasions he carried similar coolers to Mena Airport, Ar kansas. Deliveries of medical coolers to Little Rock AFB were picked up by Dr Dan Lasater - a close confidant of the then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. By now, almost two years later, Tatum had decided to document his discovery to safeguard his \"retirement\". Th ereafter, he documented all Pe gasus flights on the reverse of his flight logs. This was a difficult time for Tatum, since he had three balls to juggl e at the same time. On the one hand he was flying classified active-duty missions for the US Army; on the other, he was flying CIA missi ons arranged through Mil. Gro up A (CIA), located at the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and thir dly, he was flying Pe gasus missions under the control of William Colby, Oliver North and George Bush following his recruitment into Pegasus by Colby in 1986. Tatum completed numerous missions during hi s rotation out of Honduras. Picking up and trans-shipping coolers contai ning cocaine was a regular event. Extraordinarily, this included infiltrating Nicaraguan airspace (Tatum says it was not difficult to infiltrate any country and that \"foreign pow ers\" would kill to know how it is done), and landing at Bluefields Air Base with deliveries for placement aboard civilian C-123s and C-130s. 4 This mission was followed by a brief stint in Colombia, where he was assigned to assist the Drug Enforcement Administration's \"War on Drugs\", only to discover the DEA was heavily engaged in narcotics trafficking. THE \"BOSS HOG\" LIST One of the most flamboyant individuals invo lved in the cocaine trail from Columbia through Honduras to Panama and on into the Unit ed States, was Barry Seal. Seal flew an assortment of aircraft, offloading shipments of weapons in South America and picking up deliveries of cocaine for his retu rn flight to the US on behalf of Col. North's Enterprise. His primary base of operations was Mena Airport, Arkansas. A CIA \"asset\", Seal was later arrested and b ecame a DEA informer. Prior to his killing in 1986 - allegedly by a Medell√≠n cartel assass ination squad in revenge for informing on them - Seal openly boasted he had informa tion that implicated high-level government officials, including then-Vice President Bush, in the Enterprise's narcotics-trafficking business. Tatum would soon get to meet Barry Seal a nd become close friends. Tatum recalls being present during a meeting between Oliver North, Felix Rodr√≠guez, Amiram Nir and General Alvarez from Honduras, when North st ated that Vice President Bush was going to have his son Jeb arrange \"something out of Columbia\". This conversation focused on Barry Seal's increasingly notor ious activities. When Tatum la ter heard Seal had died, he immediately understood who was behind the k illing. The discussion also made it clear that VP Bush, Governor Clinton and his thr ee respective \"handlers\" were knee-deep in the cocaine venture and making fistloads of money. Unknown to all those present, Seal had earlie r provided Tatum with a list of names of those high-level government offi cials deeply involved with or responsible for controlling the narcotics business. Seal called them the \"Boss Hogs\". Tatum has kept this list a tightly-held secret until recent weeks. The list cites the surn ames only, and is reproduced above, as I received it, complete with misspel lings as written. I have appended their full names and titles in brackets.

If prosecuted, they clearly would have finge red the President himself."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" PEGASUS: DIRTY MONEY LAUNDERING But Tatum's story takes us even further along the dark road of power, greed and corruption. During l986, he ha d left Honduras and set up a money-laundering business in Watertown, New York State, close to th e home base of the Army's 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. The location was chos en with care. With access to Fort Drum's telephone lines for secure communications, he was assigned a Cherokee-140 fixed-wing aircraft, 5 used to ship personnel and supplies across the Canadian border under radar cover. His tenure with these companies lasted from 1986 through to 1990. This was a pure Pegasus operation. It was at Watertown that Tatum was provided with a civilian cover in the form of three construction companies: American National Home Builders, American Constructors and American Homes. Funding was provided by Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican politician and well known as the CIA's \"black money\" man. Hyde provided a US$250,000 line of credit with Key Bank, Wa tertown. Although Tatum was listed as the president in all three companies, in reality all were under the control of Ben Whittaker, a lawyer from Rochester, New York. Whittaker, Tatum says, is closely associated with Tony Wilson of the Wilson family who owne d Xerox Corporation. They are extremely wealthy and \"friends of the Rothschilds a nd Rockefellers\". In addition, he was also closely associated with South Eastern US Investment Group (SEUS) - an investment bank in Savannah, Georgia - from 1985 th rough to 1989. Another proprietary he was involved with was Irving Place Development, a service organisation of Irving Bank and Trust Company. Cocaine proceeds were laundered through these companies by an ingenious use of construction loans. In response to a question asking why the \"dr ug-related money\" was placed in \"Arkansas, Colorado and Ohio\", Tatum simply explains that he doesn't know why, adding that \"It was being done before I got there. I assume banking laws and whether or not Bush had people in his pocket in these areas.\" He does explain that the primar y figure involved in the laundry exercise in Arkansas was \"Jack Stephens\". Jackson Stephens, owner of Worthen Bank & Trust Company, is closely al igned with President Bill Clinton. Tatum states that \"...Clinton received the cash and divided it up between Stephens and [Dan] Lasater to clean it up. Stephens' company [W orthen Bank] was used as the guarantor, providing 'warehouse' lines of credit.\" Developing this theme in more detail, Tatum explains that the Enterprise was receiving drugs in exchange for the guns they supplied to the Contras. The raw product in the form of coca leaves was supplied by the Colombians and pressed into large cube-shaped bales and then shipped to Nicaragua and Honduras. 6 All the \"product\" wa s pre-sold and the delivery into the US \"guaranteed\". This eventually resulted in the sale proceeds being pre-paid to Panama, under Noriega's control. Some of this money was washed th rough banks and other companies operating in"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Panama and elsewhere. The rest was sent to Arkansas, Ohio and Colorado. Thereafter, the dirty money was filtered via construction loans with permanent \"takeouts\" \"arranged by banks and mortgage- lenders\". These, in turn, were late r sold to Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's - negotiable US Federal Mortga ge Securities that ar e traded globally on a daily basis. Each laundry \"cycle\" lasted from six months to a year. The result was dirty money transformed into good, clean, US currency. This system wasn't arbitrary or accidental. One initial \"test-bed\" was a small residential mortgage lender named Carl I. Brown (CIB) in Kansas. Others were larger, and still others became national. All were ultima tely destined to be purchased by a bank (proprietary) from Japan within a specific time-frame, 1996, as part of ongoing Pegasus plans. Eric Brown, the son of the founder of CI B, was heavily involved in these activities. Three additional companies were involved, to Tatum's knowledge: US Homes, Pulte Homes and Richmond Homes. All became ve ry successful, providing \"the American dream - as VP Bush put it in a meeting in 1987\". PEGASUS: ASSASSINATION & NEUTRALISATION Tatum has gone into considerable additional detail regarding the role of Pegasus as he knew it. He believes Pegasus was establishe d during the Eisenhower years as a secret group inside the CIA to spy on that agency on behalf of the President. At some point - believed to be after the assassination of President Kennedy - Pegasus went AWOL from direct US Government control and came under the direction of an in ternational Board of Directors which Tatum alleges now incl udes George Bush and Henry Kissinger. The directors of Pegasus meet once a year in secret conclave following G7 meetings. The group has \"representation\" from a number of intelligence agencies throughout the world. Included are the US Drug Enforcement Admi nistration (DEA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tob acco and Firearms (ATF) as well as agents from British, Israeli, Turkish and Danish Intelligence plus \"others who performed various functions for Pegasus\". 7 The mission of Pegasus, Tatum explains, is \"to 'align' world leaders and financiers to our [US] policies and standards\". One of Tatum's Pegasus duties included flyi ng \"Archer Teams\" (four-man hit teams) in his helicopter to their insertion point. 8 He states that Enrique Bermudez was assassinated in 1991 by a Pegasus team, adding he \"was shot in the back of the head while walking down the street...from about 150 yards\". Be rmudez, known as \"Commander Three Eight Zero\" was the senior Contra leader. Tatum r eceived two broken ribs when he came under small-arms fire during the assassination. 9 Following the Nicaraguan war, Bermudez sought a prominent position in the new government. Spurned by President Chamorr o, \"Commander 380\" tried to pressure George Bush to intercede on his behalf, threat ening to expose Bush's role in the cocaine trafficking enterprise. According to Tatum, Bush ordered his disposal."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Another Pegasus assassination was that of Ge neral Gustavo (Dr Gus) Alvarez Martinez, the \"cooperating\" Armed Forces Comm ander-in-Chief, Honduras. Alvarez was assassinated in 1989, following his demand fo r a bigger split of the cocaine profits. Tatum also describes his involvement in th e assassination of Amiram Nir, the former Israeli Mossad agent who went under the assumed name of Pat Weber. Nir was scheduled to testify to the Senate subcommittee and it was feared he would reveal the truth. He perished, following the shooting-down of hi s aircraft with missiles from Tatum's helicopter. Other \"neutralisations\" verge on the bizarre. An individual who must remain nameless for a variety of reasons - but whose name is know n to this writer - underwent an experience that is both horrific and chil ling. Readers are warned that what follows is not at all pleasant. For the sake of ease, I shall ca ll this individual \"Mr X\" or, simply, \"X\". 10 Mr X was a leader of one of the largest CI A-backed Contra groups. He recently testified before the US Senate Intelligence Committee. Formerly, X was a senior executive in a South American subsidiary of a leading US soft drinks corporation. During his Senate testimony, he denied any knowledge of CIA invol vement in the narcotics trade, adding that condoning such activity would have been foreign to his way of life. Not so, says Tatum. Mr X had been recruited into the CIA by then-Director William Casey, with the assistance of Oliver North. In 1990, when Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega announced there would be \"free elections\", X was ecstatic. He began jostli ng for position and asked President Bush to ensure he be given a prominent position in th e new government - in re turn for his years of toil at the behest of the CIA and the Enterpri se. The pressure came in a form that Bush could not ignore. Failure to help his friend would result in X's intimate knowledge of Bush's involvement in the dope trade being made public. His threat left Bush with a sour taste. A Pegasus team was assigned to \"neutralise\" him in early 1990. Mr X, Tatum states, \"fancied himself a love r of women. Tall, large- breasted blondes were his favourite. It was determined that, if eff ectively neutralised, [X] could be an asset. Therefore, it was decided that intimida tion would be used to control [X].\" They chose to use the drug Scopolamine, which also went by the nickname \"Burundanga\" or \"the Voodoo drug\". The drug is extracted from the pods of a flowering shrub that grows in remote regions of Sout h America. In its processed, powdered form, Scopolamine is \"void of smell, void of tast e\". When properly administered \"it causes absolute obedience\" without th is being \"observable by others \". Importantly, the target will not recall any of th e events that occurred during the period they were under the spell of the drug. In outlining these details, Tatum adds that it is important to administer the drug in the correct dosage, for he has known targets to die from too high a dose. Others have \"remained under the influence of Burundanga for up to three weeks\" . Precise dosage can"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"be achieved by liquid ingestion, the powder bein g readily soluble. Ingestion via cigarettes is also an optimum method of ingestion. It is fast-acting and takes no more than 20 minutes to work. Tatum states that X was invited to spend a re laxing weekend at a luxury hotel as a guest of his friend George Bush. His host for the weekend was a trusted 18-year veteran field- intelligence officer. The evening started with cocktails and was followed by a fine meal. \"'Nothing but the best' were the orders.\" Following the meal, he was ushered into the suite of a \"blonde bombshell\" supplied by the CIA. Mr X had already ingested a dose of Burundanga during pre-dinner cocktails. X was gallant with the blonde as they both moved into the bedroom where video cameras were already set up in one corner. In short order, the blonde had X standing naked in front of her and began to indulge his desire s. All the while, the video cameras whirred. Slowly stripping off, the \"blonde\" reveal ed his manhood in all its glory. Mr X was instructed to reciprocate the favour and perform fellatio. He obliged, his intimate activities recorded at 24 frames a second on videotape. Tatum says the male prostitute was hired from a bar in New York and killed that same evening. Two weeks later, X - wholly unaware of the events of that evening - was visited in Nicaragua. He was presented w ith a copy of the video footag e, along with instructions. Tatum says that X can never allow that vide o to be seen: \"Not only does it reveal his homosexuality, but it also reve als his bestiality and satani c worship rituals.\" As frame after frame flicked by, X reportedly wept, fo rced to watch himself kill his homosexual \"lover\" and then engage in the most grisly cannabalistic ritual imaginable. Neutralised, Mr X became a leading member of the Nicaraguan government a few short weeks later. 11 PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT Since 1985, when he first became aware of the Enterprise drug- smuggling, Tatum began collecting documents, audiotapes and videot apes for his \"retirement\". He was acutely aware that most deep-cover agents do not surviv e long in what is a very dirty game at a high-stakes poker table. Tatum says that, in 1992, President Bush inst ructed him to \"neutralise\" presidential runner Ross Perot, but he refused to do so. Tatum turned over a copy of an incriminating tape to President Bush, explaining that it w ould not be released - providing that he, his family and Perot were kept safe.

He closed the conversation by stat ing that when he or iginally \"placed the packages, I gave explicit instruc tions that if I asked for them to be sent back to me, they were to send them to the addresses on the packages.\" This, Tatum reasoned, would avoid intimidation or torture.

To be continued in the next issue of NEXUS... About the Author: Born in England, David Guyatt is a freelance in vestigative journalist whose former career in stockbroking and banking gave him the back ground that inspired his research into the shady world of international weapons fina ncing, drug-running and money laundering. His current research interests are focused on military/intelligence mind-control programs and non-lethal weapons systems, as well as the hidden influence of elitist groups around the globe. Endnotes 1 . Tatum has provided me with a variety of documents covering his military and CIA career from 1971 through 1986 when he was discharged from the US Army. His discharge papers outline a seri es of military decorations and campaign medals including \"The Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with Device\" and the \"Vietnam Service Medal\" (there are many others). Appended to these papers is a medi cal report, signed by Major Charlie Talbert, which outlines Tatum's various injuries gained during his military career&emdash;and includes notations describing his capture and tort ure in South-East Asia. Major Talbert repo rts that these injuries were tr eated in June 1972, and adds that Tatum's medical records are incomplete \"as details on this are classified\". I queried Tatum on the date, which should have been recorded as 1971. He responded, saying it was definitely 1971 and that the Army docto r only had \"Secret\" security clearance whereas Tatum had \"Top Secret\" clearance (c onfirmed in other military records, dated 1972, in my possession). Tatum avers that this discrepancy was the result of a typographical mistake on the part of the Army doctor."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Moreover, Tatum's covert role in the CIA is additionally confirmed by other military papers provided to me. In one dated 1974, Ta tum's assignment orders were \"cut\" by a Lt General USAF (name redacted) who was Chief Military Intelligence Adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other corroborative documents in my possessi on include a US Army payslip dated 1985; a copy of an \"Inmate Request Form\" on the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, showing Tatum was being detained on a \"t reason\" charge; assignment papers to the 3/498th Medac at Fort Campbell, dated 12 Ap ril 1984; copies of media news articles describing the attack on Phnom Penh; a ne ws report and photograph of Tatum in Grenada; a Special Forces USA MEDDAC Mission Request Form dated 6 April 1985, detailing Barry Seal's \"Boss Hogs\" listing; plus hard copies of Tatum's flight logs during his Honduras \"rotation\", additi onally supported by photographs of the original flight logs. I also have a copy of a TWIX message from the Commander US Forces, Honduras (Task Force Bravo), stating to his s uperiors that \"It has become increasingly evident during the past six weeks that Medevac A/C, in direct support of JTFs, in some cases are being utilised for other than Medevac requiremen ts and are being controlled by other than Medevac Officials.\" Tatum says he obtained a copy of this message from his Pegasus controller. I also have a copy of Tatum's full book manuscr ipt, \"Operation Red Rock\", together with a letter he sent to William Colby, dated 6 March 1996, which threaten: \"I will not only write about the missions but about the NWO timetable and planned events, including a chronology. And I will name names.\" I have other documents that I am not permitted to reveal but which corroborate missions in South America. 2 . The word \"contact\" is not meant to imply that Don Holmes was a CIA type. 3 . Tatum says that, through 1985, \"aviation supp ort\" for Pegasus was primarily out of Palmerola Air Base, Honduras. Ilopango Air Base is in El Salvador and it had \"operational\" support. 4 . Tatum adds that he had limited flights to Bluefields Air Base, Nicaragua, but \"primarily the military aircraft used were USAF C-141s and C-130s at Palmerola, La Mesa and San Lorenzo, Honduras. At San Lore nzo there were also civilian aircraft, including civilian C-123s.\" 5 . In addition to flying rotary-wing aircraft , Tatum was also competent flying smaller fixed-wing craft. He had acce ss to both at Fort Drum. 6 . Tatum adds in this connection that they were \"supplied with leaves and paste called 'bazooko'...the reason for that was because they were not supplying the paste fast enough, so they needed the leaves to make up for th e time. The leaves were brought from Peru.\""},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"7 . I wrote this sentence based on information provided to me and also extracted from a long list of Q&As prepared by author Rodney Stich for Tatum's attention (and now in my possession). In reviewing this article for erro rs and omissions, Tatum stated that \"there were no US DEA or ATF agents in Pegasus\". This appeared to conflict with an earlier reply to one of Stich's questi ons which stated, in part, th at \"DEA was represented. We had DEA agents, ATF agents.\" Naturally, I wa nted this clarified and asked Tatum to explain this quite significant amendment. He replied, advising that \"there were joint missions where DEA and ATF agents were us ed...they were not o fficially part of Pegasus\". Nancy Tatum advises that since Chip Tatum was in prison at the time he answered questions submitted by Stich, the \"misunderstanding\" was hers. 8 . Tatum adds that he also \"flew fixed-wing, multi-engine props and je ts...for the various missions\" and he was not limited to rotary-wing aircraft. 9 . These injuries occurred during the depa rture of the \"Team\" , six hours after the assassination itself, when they came under anti-a ircraft fire as they flew low-level across the border. Tatum was wearing two Kevlar (lightweight body armour) vests which absorbed the impact of incoming rounds. 10 . Tatum has provided me with the name of this individual, a well-known politician. He also asked that I consider excising this account from the article, for a variety of understandable reasons. I have elected to keep it, as I believe it is both an important and highly significant account. 11 . I phoned and spoke with Ron Lard, an offici al at the DEA HQ, Virginia, to ask about the properties of Burundanga. He was unabl e to provide any information. However, through other sources I can confirm that this drug is well known to cause both amnesia and a zombie-like trance in which the target follows all orders. Dr Camilo Uribe, head of Bogot√°'s toxicology clinic, says, \"it's like chemical hypnotism\". See Wall Street Journal , 3 July 1995. D uring his 22 years as a deep-cover CIA a nd DIA operative, Gene \"Chip\" Tatum saw or participated in a remarkable series of c overt operations. Foremost in his mind are the years 1986-92, when he operated for a group he called \"Pegasus\". This group operated on behalf of the US and other governments, unde rtaking tasks that ra nged from narcotics smuggling to assassinations. The name \"Pegasus\" was, in fact, a 'cover' designation used by Tatu m to protect himself against possible prosecution. Ear lier this year Tatum revealed the true structure of the group and explained why he felt the need to conceal it. Timing was all important. In a message to this writer, Tatum stated, \"It has now been well past the five-year statute of limitations which could have come back a nd haunted me. That date was January 22, 1997. On January 21, 1992 I walked out of the Jupiter Island meeting to which I referred earlier.\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Few individuals, even now, are aware of the significance of Jupiter Island. Located on the Atlantic coast of Florida, just a few miles north of Palm Beach, the island measures a mere half a mile wide and nine miles long. According to authors Webster Griffin Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, island residents read li ke a \"Who's Who\" of the Anglo-American establishment. Many have close connections to the intelligence apparatus and not a few are, or have been, members of the notori ous Skull and Bones Society, a secretive and influential Masonic lodge formed at Yale law school.1 Interestingly, many of the early residents, including Averell Harriman and Prescott Bush-George Bush's father-were strong supporters of Adolf Hitler and his Natio nal Socialist Party pr ior to World War II. Even in recent years, George Bush conti nued to have unfinished work with Nazis domiciled in South America, Tatum says-espec ially while the world's eyes were turned towards Saddam Hussein and Iraq during Desert Storm. That, however, is another story. Jupiter Island boasts hyper-sec urity. All vehicles are tracked by sensors placed in the roads and every housekeeper, gardener or othe r non-resident is requi red by ordinance to be fingerprinted and registered. Residents th emselves are carefully screened prior to being permitted to purchase real estate (many purchase by invitation, it is thought) and one of their primary duties as good residents is to perform active 'surveillance' to ensure the island remains secure.2 It was here that Tatum met with and discussed sensitive projects with then Vice President and later Pr esident Bush, at the residence of his mother, Rose Bush. SECRET GOVERNMENT APPARATUS The so-called Pegasus group's organisational st ructure, as provided by Tatum, demands recounting in detail. The various presidenti al orders, which led to the formation and operation of the covert activities in which Ta tum and others participated, are significant for they constitute a secret government within a government. This is the power that hides behind the open face of democratic government. Some have called this power base \"the Octopus\". Activities include high-level narcot ics trafficking, illegal transfers of ultra- high-tech weaponry, money laundering on a massive scale and an odd \"hit\" or \"alignment\" to keep wobbly-kneed indi viduals on the stra ight and narrow. It was in 1981, according to Tatum, that \"P resident Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive number 3 (NSDD-3) which au thorised the Vice President to chair the Special Situation Group (SSG). The Special Situation Group was a division under the National Security Council (NSC). One entity formed to support the SSG was the Terrorist Incident Working Group (TIWG), establishe d in April 1982 by authority of President Reagan in NSDD-30. This group consisted of re presentatives of the following: Director of Central Intelligence, Department of Defe nse (DoD), FBI, NSC staff and others as required.3 Tatum explained that, \"The purpose of TIWG is to provide SSG with direct operational support. TIWG then recommended to the Pr esident that a Terrorism Task Force be"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"formed and chaired by the head of SSG (t he Vice President). Reagan approved NSDD- 138 in April 1984, which extended TIWG's arm and ability to form sub-groups. As a result of NSDD-138 was the formation of the Operations Sub-Group (OSG). The Sub- Group was a select NSC-DoD-CIA-FBI-foreign in telligence agency which operated so as to bypass the regular operations of intel ligence/military/law-enforcement agencies. OSG was formed in February 1986.\" Having revealed the framework of the authoris ing presidential directives necessary for the conduct of these covert operati ons, Tatum then detailed the nitty-gritty of the OSG: \"I was an operative for OSG from April 1986 th rough January 1992. When I was operating under the authority of the OSG I would report directly to th e OSG, not to the CIA or DIA. This 'secret government' apparatus, bui lt by Bush from 1981 to 1986, was able to draw upon assets from the CIA, the DoD Special Operations units a nd the private sector. Using the private sector cl ause, Don Gregg, VP Bush's National Security Advisor, included a representative from British Intelligence and Israeli Intelligence. To date I have called this group 'Pegasus' in an attempt not to divulge its true identity until I was on safe ground. Although most of the missions performe d by OSG-2 are classified, the existence of the organisation is now declassified.\" Until Tatum forwarded these details, the ex istence of more than one OSG was unknown. In fact, Tatum has now revealed the existe nce of three OSGs. OSG-1 was headed by Ted Shackley and was \"our anti-narcotics group\" .4 OSG-2 was the anti-terrorism group and OSG-3 was \"our 'alignment' group\". Tatum wa s originally posted to OSG-2 which was commanded by Col. Oliver North. The thir d group, OSG-3, was commanded by Richard Secord. Following the exposure of Oliver North's role in Contragate in 1987, North resigned as head of OSG-2 a nd his spot was taken over by Secord. Tatum moved up to command OSG-3 at the same time. All three OSGs answered to those indivi duals who sat on the TIWG. General Colin Powell represented the Department of Defe nse; William Casey, the CIA; and Donald Gregg, the National Security C ouncil. \"FBI guys rotated in and out,\" Tatum says. \"It was like they couldn't get anyone,\" he concludes. Representing British Intelligence was Sir Colin Figure. Formerly head of MI6, Sir Colin transferred in 1986 to become \"Security Coordinator\", one of the top sl ots at the Cabinet office under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher. He retired in 1989. Amiram Ni r represented Israel i interests until his assassination by an \"Archer\" team led by Tatum-at the re quest of high-level Israeli individuals-in 1988. Any of these six could \"call a mission\". In addition, George Bush could do likewise. Of significance, too, was the occasional representation on the TIWG of Lord Chalfont. The British lord was an adviser on \"Mid-East affairs\" between 1986 and 1990. From the moment Chip Tatum was recruited to the OSG, he was posted to upstate New York where he established a number of cover businesses. One of these was Cedar Shores Estates, Inc.5 This was his base of op erations throughout th e next six years.6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"It may be no more than sheer coincidence that the name of the company is similar to Cedar Holdings, a British company that had a relationship to former British Conservative Party Treasurer, Lord (Alistair) McAlpine. Author Peter Jones, in an unpublished book, looked in some detail at the business activ ities of this Conservative Party \"Grey Eminence\" and leading Freemason.7 Of no little interest was the author's detailed connections of numerous companies that he be lieved were involved in all manner of dark activities. Interestingly, these included a comp any called Leisure Circle that has a sinuous connection to Sir John Cuckney, one of the centr al figures of the Scott Inquiry into arms sales to Iraq. Whilst these connections are admittedly tenuous, to say the least, it should be noted that Tatum's upstate New York operation was also involved in shipping the most sophisticated weapons across the border to Ca nada. Not least are th e known connections between Oliver North's related gun-running operations that saw dirty money being laundered through the British Channel Islands and the London-based BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International). Mone y laundering was one of the principal activities of Col. Oliver North. THE \"SUPERBILLS\" STING One operation of which Tatum has knowledge concerns the so-called \"Superbills\" or \"Supernotes\" sting. Years earlier, in the late '60s or early '70s, the CIA had secretly provided to the Shah of Iran a perfect set of printing plates that could reproduce US$100 bills without blemish. Also provided was an in taglio printing press. This special printing press ensures that the etched plate meets paper with tremendous force, creating the distinctive embossed feel of a genuine banknote. In addition, the Shah was also given the ink and banknote-quality paper, enabling hi m to produce perfect counterfeit US dollar banknotes. The Shah later fled Iran and left the plates and press be hind in his confusion. The whole caboodle sat in the mint at Tehran, according to some experts.8 According to Tatum, a deal was arranged in the early to mid-'80s between VP George Bush, Panama's Manuel Noriega and the Ir anian leadership. A sum of US$8 billion deposited in the Banco Nacional de Panama on behalf of Colombian cocaine king Pablo Escobar was \"lent\" to George Bush. Of this , US$4 billion was shi pped by plane to Iran where it was exchanged at a ratio of one good bi ll for two counterfeit bills. On the return trip, the 707 aircraft's cargo c ontainer carried two shrink-wr apped pallets containing $4 billion each. The 707 arrived at Howard/Albrook Air Force Base in Panama where the pallets were offloaded under armed guard of the Panamanian military. The counterfeit notes were re-deposited into Escobar's acc ount at the Panama central bank. Under no circumstances could the counterfeit bills be permitted to leave the bank vault-for fear of devaluing the US currency with forged notes -and active steps woul d later be taken to ensure this."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The other half of Escobar's \"good\" money wa s placed into the hands of Nana DeBusia, the grandson of Guyana's first democratic leader. DeBusia was chosen by the CIA's William Casey to launder the massive sum into numerous bank accounts under the joint signatures of VP George Bush and Director Casey. The next leg of the operation was to retrieve the $4 billion exchanged with the Iranians for the Superbills. This was facilitated by the supply of military equipment, arms, ammunition and replacement parts for weapons systems. This part of the deal was arranged by Col. Oliver North on behalf of the CIA's William Casey. The results of these complex manoeuvres were twofold. On the one hand the CIA acquired $4 billion via the arms sales, for use in future blac k operations, without the need to rely on congressional oversig ht or authority. If later caugh t, Tatum says \"...the CIA can report the source of funds as being from an ar ms transaction with Iran\". Some of these funds were then used to support the Contras, whilst the rest disappeared down the ultra- black hole of the Company's covert finances. Meanwhile, Nana DeBusia had begun la undering the remaining $4 billion through various banks, including the Vatican Bank.9 Fo r his trouble, DeBusia was entitled to take a commission amounting to $200 million. The remaining $3.8 billion was then secreted in private, numbered accounts around the gl obe and controlled by George Bush and William Casey. The operation was complete apart from some necessary mopping-up which occurred over the following years: 1) In 1989, Pablo Escobar was targeted by an intensive US-Colombian \"War on Drugs\" campaign. He fled into hiding, in fear of his life. Eventually, in 1993, he was tracked down and killed in a police shoot-out. A Br itish TV documentary revealed that the \"Cocaine King\" was gunned down while attempting to escape and was probably unarmed. The campaign waged against Escoba r ensured he could not withdraw the $8 billion in Superbills. Following his death, the quantity and quality of cocaine shipments from Colombia immediately increased mani foldly, giving lie to the \"War on Drugs\". 2) Also during 1989, Panama's General Nori ega was captured in the US invasion of Panama. Noriega was later convicted and pl aced in US federal prison under constant guard to ensure his silence.10 3) Penultimately, Nana DeBu sia was indicted on 32 counts including bank fraud and thereby effectively silenced.11 4) Earlier, in 1987, DCI William Casey died of a brain tumour-just days before he would have been required to attend the Senate hearings into the Contragate affair."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"According to Tatum, only one figure em erged unscathed: George Bush, who alone retained control of $3.8 billi on in laundered funds. Obvious ly, the CIA still retained control over the balance of their $4 b illion share of the 'sting' operation. It is of considerable sign ificance that this operation ha s been corroborated by another source whose credibility is not in question.12 This individual was present in Tehran during many of these events, and was later pos ted to another sensitive location in this connection. Moreover, it has additionally been revealed that Ban ca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) was heavily involved in the Superbills sting. That BNL was an intrinsic part of Oliver North's so-called \"Enterprise\"-in re ality, the OSGs of the Terrorist Incident Working Group-is beyond doubt.13 However, the question remains: What did Geor ge Bush intend to do with his 'black' $3.8 billion? What was the ultimate purpose of th e operation? Perhaps so me of the money was to be used to grease palms and otherwise fi nance Bush's bid for the presidency following the completion of President Reagan's second term. Maybe it was used to finance other lucrative projects. Perhaps it was to be used to inject financial muscle into another, grander scheme, of which Tatum has recently spoken, involving George Bush's \"scope and mission\" paper for a New World Order. A copy of the \"scoping\" paper supplied to Ta tum by George Bush outlines the formation of a Corporation whose purpose is to \" ...provide a central netw ork of information, analysts and strategists on an internationa l basis in pursuit of wo rld order and economic stability\". The \"scope\" of the Co rporation involves four features: 1) Centralisation of in formational services; 2) Analysis of data by region-specific analysts; 3) Provide recommendations based upon anal ysts' reports by inte rnational experts; 4) Provide international master plan for world growth and economic stability. The Corporation is to be priv ately owned with a board of di rectors \"consisting of twelve members, elected annually by the shareholde rs\". In addition there are to be five departments: \"Data Resources; Political Ma nagement; Economic Manage-ment; Military Management; Environmental Management\".14 THE COMPLETE \"BOSS HOGS\" LIST But it is in the realm of narcotics trafficking th at Tatum is most vociferous. Part 1 of this article recounted the names of high-level US individuals, given to Tatum by Barry Adler Seal before he was killed in 1986.

In March 1996, Tatum wrote to former Director of Central Inte lligence, William Colby. R eaders will recall that it was Colby who originally recruited Tatu m into the CIA in 1971 and set him on his career as a covert in telligence operator. Since that tim e, Tatum developed a fondness for the super-spook, and Colby, in tur n, played the role of mentor . In his letter, Tatum asked Colby to write a foreword for his book, Operation Red Rock, which he had completed just two months earlier. But there was anothe r purpose in writing to the former DCI. Four years earlier, when Tatum resigned hi s OSG command, he had volunteered to plead guilty on a felony charge in order to discredit himself. This was part of Tatum's strategy of survival, as he was aware that one didn't resign this particular team and remain alive for long. The fact that he had collected a body of evidence (including video and audio tapes and other related documentation) as 'life insurance', gave muscle to his negotiation. At that time he had not planne d to reveal any of the details that he has now provided. In the event, his offer was taken up and he served a prison sentence of just over one year. That is where matters should have ended. However, having served his sentence-thus comp lying with his part of the agreement-both Tatum and his wife, Nancy, were subsequent ly arrested and charged with another misdemeanour. Tatum got angry. His letter to Co lby stated: \"I have always kept my word with you. I told you that I would discredit myself. I don't need your help to accomplish this. But to charge Nancy with a crime, and expect me to allow this, is beyond my comprehension.\" He angrily continued: \"I know that North and Rodr√≠guez are the fuel for this, but haven't you warned them that I wouldn' t sit still for this?\" He then added: \"I do not blame you for this; I am disappointed that you have allowed the 'Pond Scum' to control you!\" There then followed a warning: \"The second boo k that I have already started will contain my movements from 1980 through today. I wi ll not only write about the missions but about the NWO [New World Order] timet able and planned events including a chronology.\" Ominously he added: \"And I will name names. You must detach yourself from these people!\" Tatum then continued by outlining how he would enter evidence for his forthcoming trial and warning that if disallowed for reasons of classification, then \"a Special Prosecutor will be required to investigate the information, and the videotape tells no lies.\" He added: \"I also had stills and an audi o clip of a meeting added to the video. Out of respect for you I have kept your name out to this point, but if you don't separate yourself from these terrorists I will have no choice but to reveal your involvement also. Either way, the group will be exposed-by the media or by the investigating committee. Either way, they're out"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of gas!\" Tatum closed the letter by sayi ng: \"Mr Colby-you've done too much for your country to be disgraced in the manner that these men will be.\" Less than two months later, the former DCI was reported missing. By Monday 6 May 1996, Colby's body was found. It was later re ported that Colby died following a \"canoeing\" accident on the Wicomico Ri ver, Maryland. Tatum and many others (including this writer) doubt this. Throughout hi s life, Colby had an all-abiding fear of water. It would have been entirely out of char acter for him to step voluntarily into a boat, let alone a canoe. Despite this, Colby's death officially remain s an accident. This has come as no special surprise to Tatum, who recently stated to this writer: \"I knew the OSG were bulletproof when one of our targets, a 25-year-old, was re ported to have died of a heart attack. His name was Al-Jarrah.\" That, however, is another story. POSTSCRIPT At 3 pm on Friday 4 April 1997-s hortly after publica tion of Part 1 of this article-Chip Tatum was roused from a mid-afternoon snooze and told to report to the warden of his prison. He was informed that he was being released-less than mi dway through his 27- month sentence-with immediate effect, followi ng an appellate court decision that found his conviction by Judge Adams to be illegal. The Tatums are now freely enjoying together the sunshine and cajun cooking of Florida, as Chip turns his attention to beginning a new career-his firs t real job-hunting in 26 years. \"Spy stuff\" will not form part of his job-search efforts. Meanwhile, he has written and published his Chronicles that de tail many of his allegations.15 Endnotes: 1.

Shackley's involvement in the narcotics indus try is legion. Not least, Col Bo Gritz-the most highly decorated Special Forces officer in history-has spoken of his encounter with the Burmese warlord Khun Sa. Housed in the cen tre of the \"Golden Triangle\", Khun Sa is one of the world's leading e xporters of raw opium. In an interview captured on camera, the warlord stated that his pr imary contact in the heroin bus iness was the CIA's very own Ted Shackley. Shackley worked closely with Ma fia chief Santos Trafficante, according to Khun Sa. 5. Tatum has stated that it was routine for a ll the OSG operatives to establish their own businesses as \"covers\". Funding was provided as a line of credit with the Key Bank of Central New York, Watertown, New York state, by Republican Harry Hyde. The company was formed by attorney Ben Wh ittaker. Legal representation was through O'Hara and Crough in Syracuse, NY. Tatum also operated through a number of other similar \"fronts\". These included Progressive Structures, Inc., Irving Place Capital & Development, and American National Home Builders. 6. Tatum has provided me with a number of documents of this proprietary company, including details of incorporation, board minutes, bank statements, legal billings and copies of cashed cheques. In addition he has also provided documents relating to other front companies he was involved with. 7. Jones, Peter, The Obedience of Austra lia, privately published, 1995. This book covers in considerable detail Masonic business connect ions that are shadow y to say the least. 8. For additional details see the article by Fr edric Dannen and Ira Silverman, published in the New Yorker, 23 October 1995. 9. Tatum says DeBusia laundered this su m through banks in London. Coincidences abound in this story and they may be no more than coincidences. However, I think it is worth citing Gerald James, former Chairman of Astra Plc and one of the principal figures in the Scott affair and arms sales to Iraq. In his book, In the Public Interest (Warner Books, 1996), Gerald James has reproduced an internal company memorandum referring to the massive British-Saudi Al Yamamah ar ms deal in which a sum of US$4 billion is mentioned in connection with a bribe to Saudi Prince Bandar, a nephew of King Fahd. The memorandum stated: \"This 4 bil US was me ntioned in connection with M. Thatcher's son.\" Interestingly, the sum of $3.8 billion is mentioned in the Kerry Report that looked into the Iran-Contra affair. 10. One of the principal prosecution witne sses against General Noriega was Gabriel Tab√≥ada. Arguably, without Tab√≥ada's testimony (he was regarded as the \"star witness\") the prosecution case against Noriega may well have failed. Tatum has provided this writer with a number of priv ate letters and other documents written by Tob√≥ada. These clearly show that Tob√≥ada was \"coached\" by the prosecution in what to say and, more"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"significantly, what not to say. Tob√≥ada's corre spondence makes it clear he was aware that the prosecution case against Noriega was seve rely flawed by perjury-a fact known to the prosecution team. Today, Tob√≥ada lives in fear of his life-a state of affairs that the US Department of Justice dismisses out of hand. 11. Following the intervention of the CI A, DeBusia was acquitted on all counts. Effectively discredited, he will co ntinue to maintain silence. 12. Private communication with this writer. 13. See Alan Friedman's The Spider's Web (F aber & Faber, 1993) for a more detailed role of BNL in the Contragate affair.
