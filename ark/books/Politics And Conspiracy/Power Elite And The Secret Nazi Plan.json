[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE POWER ELITE AND THE SECRET NAZI PLAN By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. February 23, 2009 NewsWithViews.com Dennis Laurence Cuddy, historian and political analyst, received a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (major in American History, minor in political science). Dr. Cuddy has taught at the university level, has been a political and economic risk analyst for an international consulting firm, and has been a Senior Associate with the U.S. Department of Education. Cuddy has also testified before members of Congress on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice. Dr. Cuddy has authored or edited twenty books and booklets, and has written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers around the nation, including The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and USA Today. He has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows in various parts of the country, such as ABC Radio in New York City, and he has also been a guest on the national television programs USA Today and CBS's Nightwatch. [NOTE: As I’ve written many times before, the goal of the Power Elite (PE) is a World Socialist Government. Critical to coercing Americans to accept Socialism is the nationalization of key sectors of the economy, such as banking. I’ve indicated in the past that this type of coercion would be brought about by an economic crisis, such as the one we are currently experiencing. Relevant to this, Jon Meacham and Evan Thomas wrote “We Are All Socialists Now” (Newsweek, Feb. 16, 2009), and Matthew Richardson and Nouriel Roubini wrote “Nationalize the Banks! We’re all Swedes Now!” (The Washington Post, Feb. 15, 2009) which begins: “The U.S. banking system is close to being insolvent, and unless we want to become like Japan in the 1990s—or the United States in the 1930s—the only way to save it is to nationalize it.” Even Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on ABC’s “This Week” (Feb. 15, 2009) indicated we should consider the possibility of nationalizing banks. [And in case you think this crisis happened accidentally, just consider the fact that “the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) waived the 12 to 1 leverage ratios for the five biggest investment banks. Those banks then leveraged 40 to 1 and collapsed the worldwide financial system” (January 5, 2009 Financial Sense editorial by James Quinn of the Wharton Business School). Do you really believe no one could see what the disastrous results of going from 12 to 1 leveraging to 40 to 1 would be? When these banks started taking losses, Quinn has also pointed out, their capital was immediately wiped out and the problem was dumped in the taxpayers’ laps.] In previous columns, I’ve mentioned the secret Nazi plan described in American official Sumner Welles’ The Time for Decision (1944). It was a plan (for a Nazi loss in WWII) which would come to fruition two generations later. It included Nazi agents going underground into two successive countries to avoid detection (Paul Dickopf went"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"underground into Switzerland in 1942). These agents would eventually rise to positions of power in those second nations. Welles must have learned of this secret plan when he was on friendly terms with the Nazi leadership long before the U.S. entered WWII. A Google search of “sumner welles portraits” shows a photograph of Welles and Hermann Goering on March 19, 1940. But why almost two years before the U.S. entered WWII would the Nazis plan for a loss? And why after WWII was there never an investigation of this secret plan? Robert Ludlum in his fictional The Apocalypse Watch referred to “The Brotherhood of the Watch” a global neo-Nazi secret organization formed in the days after the Third Reich’s defeat and exposed about 50 years later. As I’ve written before, Hitler’s rise and demise were facilitated by the PE. In the same year (1942) the Nazi agent Paul Dickoff went underground into Switzerland and the U.S. was already in the war, “Standard Oil of New Jersey managers shipped the enemy’s fuel through neutral Switzerland and the enemy was shipping Allied fuel. The Chase Bank in Nazi-occupied Paris after Pearl Harbor was doing millions of dollars worth of business with the enemy with the full knowledge of the heard office in Manhattan. Ford trucks were being built for the German occupation troops in France with authorization from Dearborn, Michigan. Col. Sosthenes Behn, head of ITT, flew from New York to Madrid to Berne during the war to help improve Hitler’s communications systems and improve the robot bombs that devastated London. And ITT built the Focke-Wulfs that dropped bombs on British and American troops.” (Charles Higham’s Trading With the Enemy , p. xv). As I’ve also written before, I.G. Farben’s war industries (e.g. chemicals, rubber, etc.) staffed and directed Hitler’s intelligence section and ran the Nazi slave labor camps. So why at the end of WWII were 87% of Farben’s industries still intact? At the end of the war, U.S. Justice Department attorney James Stewart Martin (author of All Honorable Men , 1950) went to Germany to sort out the relationship of American and German businesses during the war, but he was thwarted in his efforts, saying: “We had not been stopped in Germany by German businesses. We had been stopped in Germany by American business. The forces that stopped us had operated from the United States but had not operated in the open. We were not stopped by a law of Congress, by an Executive Order of the President, or even by a change of policy approved by the president.... In short, whatever it was that stopped us was not ‘the government.’ But it clearly had command of channels through which the government normally operates. The relative powerlessness of government... is of course not new.... National governments have stood on the sidelines while bigger operators arranged the world’s affairs.” Relevant to this, it’s important to remember that the PE is NOT the government of any country, but the PE’s agents are IN the governments of countries. In order to explain what the PE was doing, it is important to look at how they operate, and John J. McCloy as an agent of the PE is a useful example of this regard. In the 1930s, PE agent McCloy’s law firm of Cravath, de Gersdorff, Swaine & Wood were attorneys for I.G. Farben. This is perhaps one reason McCloy sat in Hitler’s box at the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1936 Olympics in Berlin (because the PE is neither right nor left politically, McCloy in late July 1961 went swimming with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the Black Sea). On October 29 of the same year (1936), American Ambassador to Germany William E. Dodd wrote to President Wilson’s chief advisor Col. Edward M. House expressing his surprise and wonder that “in spite of all the debts and all the huge losses since the great war, more than a hundred of our greater corporations have subsidiaries here and are of course involved in a great deal of the acute business which goes on. At the same time no corporation can take profits out of the country, although some I am told earn as much as half a million dollars a year.... Yet a great many of these corporations are supplying the means for rearmament, actually supplying arms. It’s strange to me that they are willing to risk the property of their stockholders in such a way.” Four years later, Skull & Bones member Henry Stimson went to Washington to become President Franklin Roosevelt’s Secretary of War, and he brought McCloy with him as Assistant Secretary of War. To demonstrate the importance of McCloy, Stimson would later question “whether anyone in the Administration ever acted without having a word with McCloy.” McCloy’s lawfirm had as one of its clients the Rockefeller family, and during WWII McCloy was a senior member of John D. Rockefeller III’s intelligence group, the State- War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC). With this background, McCloy established the highly secret U.S. Army’s Psychological Warfare Division at the time of D-Day in 1944. It was also during this time from 1940 to 1946 that American Thomas Harrington McKittrick (an associate of J.P. Morgan Banking) was president of the Nazi- controlled Bank for International Settlements (BIS) where $378 million of the Nazis’ looted gold had been sent. [NOTE: People across the U.S. question whether there really is a Power Elite (PE) facilitating global events. My response is, “If a former Chief of Special Operations (clandestine activities) for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (USJCS) says there’s a secret team that controls the U.S. and the World, why is it so hard to believe in a PE acting similarly?” Former Special Ops Chief for the USJCS, L. Fletcher Prouty authored The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World (1973), in which he revealed there’s a “Secret Team consisting of security-cleared individuals in and out of government who receive secret intelligence data gathered by the CIA and the National Security Agency.... The Secret Team has very close affiliations with elements of power in more than threescore foreign countries and is able when it chooses to topple governments, to create governments, and to influence governments almost anywhere in the free world.” Continuing the parade of Clinton administration Rhodes Scholars appointed by President Obama, Ashton Carter has been named an Undersecretary of Defense. Also, Obama’s “con” or “scam” regarding taxes continues as well. The idea that taxing only those earning over $250,000 per year will not negatively affect all of us is ridiculous. Many small businesses (e.g., five or six workers) file taxes under this provision of the tax code. If their taxes go up the owners have only three choices: (1) absorb the tax"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"themselves (which could cause them to go out of business if operating with only marginal profit), (2) cut costs (e.g., lay off workers or cut workers’ hours or wages), or (3) pass the increase along to consumers. While a few may opt for number 1 most would opt for the numbers 2 or 3. In these tough economic times, number 2 would be the preferred option, and that would increase unemployment. If Obama hopes that by the time these new tax provisions take effecting 2010 the economy will have turned around, that still would not change the three choices, except that number 3 may be preferred. Since the businesses therefore would then pass along their tax increases in the form of higher prices (inflation) to the consumer, how will Obama’s plan help us? It won’t! All of us will feel the effect of increased unemployment in the short term and higher prices (which are like tax increases) in the long run. And since those making over $250,000 per year already pay a majority of the taxes, do you really believe increasing their taxes alone will pay for Obama’s new national health insurance program and all the other new federal programs he has planned? This is why one might call all of this an “Obamacon” or “Obamascam.”] In Part 1 of this series, I mentioned the importance of I.G. Farben. In fact, after WWII the U.S. War Department conducted an investigation and produced a document that revealed: “Without I.G.’s immense productive facilities, its intense research and vast affiliations, Germany’s prosecution of the war would have been unthinkable and impossible....” And how was I.G. Farben able to have “immense productive facilities”? A great deal of Farben’s expansion prior to WWII was paid for by funds from Rockefeller’s National City Bank, J.P. Morgan’s Equitable Trust Company, Harris Forbes & Co., and another Rockefeller entity called Dillon, Read & Company. Hitler received funds via the August Thyssen Bank which was affiliated with the Harrimans of Skull & Bones in the U.S. The Union Banking Corporation (UBC) of New York was a joint Thyssen-Harriman operation, according to author Antony Sutton, and it had four directors who were members of the same Skull & Bones cell (D 115) as well as two Nazi directors (Johann Groninger and H. J. Kouwenhoven). Also mentioned in Part 1 of this series as being important was PE agent John J. McCloy. After WWII, Mc Cloy became president of the World Bank in 1947 and U.S. High Commissioner in Germany in 1949. From this latter influential position, he pressured West Germany (and France) to establish the European and Steel Community which later became the basis for the Common Market and eventually the European Union. This type of regional economic arrangement was a necessary part of the PE’s plan to link such economic arrangements into a management structure which would form the basis for a World Socialist Government. Regarding the Nazis, not only would their ability to wage war have been impossible without fuel (from Standard Oil, etc.), but also impossible without armaments from Krupp industries. Despite the fact that Alfried Krupp was tried before a Nuremberg Military Tribunal and found guilty as a war criminal on July 31, 1948 (with confiscation of all his property), on February 4, 1951 McCloy issued a general amnesty plus the return of Krupp’s personal fortune and corporate property."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Following this, McCloy in 1953 became chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which was an outgrowth of PE member Cecil Rhodes’ “scheme to take the government of the whole world.” McCloy held this position until 1970 when he was followed as chairman by David Rockefeller, who in his Memoirs has acknowledged being part of a “secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States,... conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world.” During his tenure as CFR chairman, McCloy in 1956 had written: “In my view we must be ready to consider the most far-reaching proposals, including those for total disarmament, universal, enforceable and complete with international controls and inspection.” Because of this viewpoint, President-elect John Kennedy on January 2, 1961 designated McCloy as his principal disarmament advisor and negotiator. Nine months later, Kennedy on September 25, 1961 addressed the U.N. General Assembly, proclaiming: “Let us join in dismantling the national capacity to wage war.... The program to be presented to this assembly is for general and complete disarmament.” Complete disarmament of the U.S. and all other nations was an important goal of the PE. Concerning the Nazi’s secret plan mentioned earlier, by the late 1960s Nazi agents had time to ascend to positions of power in the world. By 1968, Nazi secret agent Paul Dickopf had left Switzerland and became head of Interpol, headquartered in France (remember the plan was to go underground into two successive countries). He remained in that strategically powerful position until 1972. At this point, it is important to remember that Dickopf, McCloy, and others are not the PE, but merely its agents and not necessarily familiar with what each other are doing (e.g., McCloy may not have been involved in the Nazis’ secret plan). The PE is like a puppeteer pulling the strings of its individual agents in a coordinated manner to accomplish its overall objectives. However, given McCloy’s position in the War Department, given that no one in FDR’s Administration probably “ever acted without having a word with McCloy,” and given his position as U.S. High Commissioner of Germany, it’s doubtful he was unaware of the Rat Lines and Operation Paperclip. Rat Lines were escape routes Nazis used fleeing Europe at the end of WWII in order to get primarily to South America, but also perhaps to the U.S., Canada and the Middle East. If you do a simple Google search for “History of the Italian Rat Line,” an April 10, 1950 U.S. Army intelligence document will appear. One Nazi intelligence officer, Richard Gehlen, was employed by the CIA after WWII and headed the Gehlen Org which supported the ODESSA (Organization of former SS members) network in their use of Rat Lines. Examples of prominent Nazis using Rat Lines were Adolph Eichmann, Klaus Barbie, and Josef Mengele. At the end of WWII, a secret intelligence operation code-named Operation Paperclip brought hundreds of Nazi scientists to the U.S., and some parts of the operation may still exist today. The operation was under the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(JIOA). Beginning in 1948, the JIOA also began Project National Interest, which brought Nazis to the U.S. to work in universities or as defense contractors. John D. Rockefeller III as a Naval Lt.-Commander from 1942 to 1945 was a member of the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC, formed December 1944, was a precursor of National Security Council). SWNCC was headed by John J. McCloy, and it approved an expanded version of Operation Paperclip, bringing about 1000 German and Austrian scientists to the U.S. in the “interest of national security” (see SWNCC 257/22). According to Secret Agenda (1991) by Linda Hunt, some Nazi scientists (like Siegfried Ruff and Hermann Becker-Freyseng) “were employed under Paperclip to continue the same type of research that had resulted in the murder of Dachau prisoners!” Werner von Braun, leading NASA space scientist here in the 1960s had been a Major in Himmler’s ruthless SS. Convicted Nazi war criminal Otto Ambrose came to the U.S. as part of Project National Interest and worked as a consultant to W.R. Grace & Company for decades. Interestingly, Ambrose had been a director of I.G. Farben which manufactured Zyklon B, the gas that killed millions of Jews and others. Ambrose was also one of those released by U.S. High Commissioner of Germany John J. McCloy in 1951. Nazi Major-General Walter Dornberger commanded a missile base at Peenemunde in WWII, and under Operation Paperclip became vice-president of Bell Aerosystems in Niagara Falls, New York. The list goes on and on, but it’s clear McCloy and Rockefeller were aware of high profile Nazis who had been helped to escape to the U.S. at the end of WWII. And one can only wonder whether these Nazis might have been in contact over the years with those other Nazi agents who early in WWII spread throughout the world in order to fulfill today the secret Nazi plan mentioned at the beginning of this article! Given the current economic crisis in the world, remember that part of the secret Nazi plan (scheduled to come to fruition today) involved “creating doubts among the people of each country as to the ability, integrity or wisdom of their leading statesmen.” The secret Nazi plan also involved Nazi agents “being trained to appear as men of large financial interests... over a period of years gaining a controlling influence... in labor unions in the banking world.... When the right time comes, stimulate internal dissension sufficiently to destroy the morale of the people.” Sound familiar? Are we moving toward Socialism in the U.S. today? Are labor unions or “workers” being emphasized today? Since the U.S. is a “nation” could one call what is happening today a movement toward National Socialism emphasizing workers? And doesn’t the term Nazi stand for National Socialist (German) Workers’ Party? You can read in any good dictionary that the Nazis were Fascists who believe in “private enterprise under centralized government control.” Isn’t this what is occurring today? This is not an accusation that President Obama and the Democrats are some kind of secret Nazis. It is evident, however, that the country is being moved toward Socialism/Fascism, and thus the real Nazi agents would consider Obama and the Democrats (and some Republicans) as “useful idiots” in the fulfillment of their secret plan."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"[Note: Previously, I mentioned there are growing calls for a single global currency, and to them one can add that of Prof. Hossein Askari of Georgetown University, who wrote: “The only sure way to stabilize the world economy is to create a world central bank and a single reserve currency” ( Asia Times Online , Feb. 6, 2009). A single global currency will be an extremely important step on the way toward the planned World Socialist Government, which will be brought about by linking regional economic unions. And in that regard, one reads in “Mexico’s Fox Touts EU-like Integration for the Americas” ( San Antonio Express , March 28) that on March 27, 2009 former Mexican president Vicente Fox in San Antonio “expressed the hope that Canada, the United States and Mexico, indeed the rest of Latin America, would function like the European Union.” Fox stated, “My vision is to speed up the process of further integration” among the nations.] Regarding my previous columns about the Power Elite (PE) and the secret Nazi plan for today, I have referred to American official Sumner Welles’ book The Time for Decision (1944) partially revealing the plan. For some reason, most people do not seem to take this threat seriously, saying those Nazis from World War II are dead or too old to pose a real threat. They miss the importance of Welles’ statement that the German General Staff “made detailed plans for a later renewal of its attempt to dominate the world... when the favorable moment arrives... perhaps two generations from now,” which means the plan had to include succession. I mentioned in earlier columns that Abwehr (counterintelligence) Nazi agent Paul Dickopf went underground in the autumn of 1942 (he became head of Interpol 1968- 1972). According to journalist Curt Riess in The Nazis Go Underground (1944), it was on the morning of November 9, 1942 that Hitler’s Reichsfuehrer SS Heinrich Himmler in his private office in the Brown House in Munich confided to Martin Bormann (head of the Nazi Party) that while Germany may have to capitulate militarily, “never must the National Socialist German Workers Party [Nazi Party] capitulate. That is what we have to work for from now.” Relevant to this effort, Himmler organized everything right down to the last detail regarding Nazis going underground and spreading throughout the world to fulfill their plan, perhaps in two generations. Preliminary work and planning was done by Himmler at the Gestapo building in the Prince Albrechtstrasse, Berlin, and the major Nazi undergound movement began May 16, 1943 at 11 Koenigsallee in Berlin under SS Generals Werner Heissmeyer and Fritz Kaltenbrunner. Curt Riess in 1944 also revealed that “[The Nazi underground] organization in Argentina is all set up and waiting impatiently for the ‘go-ahead’ signal. Almost the same may be said of the numerous ‘collaborators’ in the United States.” Joseph Farrell (author of The SS Brotherhood of the Bell and Nazi International ) said that Bormann had shifted $800 million in Nazi assets to Argentina, which was then used as a great power leverage with western banks. In Europe, according Adam LeBor (“Revealed: The secret report that shows how the Nazis planned a Fourth Reich... in the EU,” Daily Mail , May 9, 2009), there was a secret meeting at the Maison Rouge Hotel in Strasbourg on August 10, 1944 where Nazi officials ordered an elite group of German industrialists to plan for the Nazis’ return to power in a Fourth Reich. This information was provided in U.S. Military Intelligence"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"report (known as The Red House Report) EW-Pa 128 written in November 1944 by a French spy who was at the Strasbourg meeting. LeBor writes that “powerful Nazi-era bankers, industrialists and civil servants... worked for a new cause: European economic and political integration.” The basis for this plan had been developed years earlier, as on September 11, 1940 Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels delivered a speech, “The Europe of the Future” to Czech intellectual workers and journalists stating: “I am convinced that in 50 years, people will no longer think in terms of countries.... In those days people will think in terms of continents.... No single European nation can in the long run be allowed to stand in the way of the general process of organization.” In the same year (1940) as Goebbels’ speech, Nazi Minister of Economic Affairs (1937- 1945) Walther Funk wrote a 16-page booklet, The Economic Future of Europe , and called for a “Central European Union” and “European Economic Area.” In 1942, Funk co-authored The European Economic Community , in which he declared, “There must be a readiness to subordinate one’s own interests in certain cases to those of [the EC].” According to the 3-page Red House Report (marked “Secret”) in 1944, Himmler’s SS Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Scheid (a Lt.-General) began the meeting at the Maison Rouge Hotel and ordered German industrialists to “make contacts and alliances with foreign firms, but this must be done individually and without attracting any suspicion.” Sheid also directed them to exploit the finances of those German firms that had already been used as fronts for economic penetration abroad, and he cited the American partners of Krupp, Zeiss, Leica, and the Hamburg-America Lines shipping company (remember here that George Herbert Walker’s and Prescott Bush’s Hamburg-America Lines transported Nazi Dr. Ernst Rudin and other Nazis to the Third International Congress on Eugenics in 1932 in New York where Rudin was unanimously elected president of the International Federation of Eugenic Societies). LeBor in the Daily Mail wrote that “as most of the industrialists left the meeting [in Strasbourg], a handful were beckoned into another smaller gathering, presided over by Dr. Bosse of the Armaments Ministry. There were secrets to be shared with the elite of the elite.... [Bosse] laid out the three-stage strategy for the Fourth Reich.... In stage 3, German businesses would set up a ‘sleeper’ network of agents abroad through front companies, which were to be covers for military research and intelligence, until the Nazis returned to power.” German economist Ludwig Erhard had written that their industry could expand after Germany’s defeat through supranationalism, meaning the voluntary surrender of national sovereignty to an international body. Thus, Germany (and France) were the primary advocates of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which created a common market for coal and steel and which would evolve into the European Union. LeBor wrote that “before the common market could be set up, the Nazis industrialists had to be pardoned, and Nazi banker and officials reintegrated. In 1951, John Jay McCloy, the American High Commissioner for Germany, issued an amnesty for industrialists convicted of war crimes.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Two years before 1957, the Bilderberg Group held its Garmisch-Partenkirchen Conference September 23-25, 1955, and relevant to “European Unity,” the Bilderberg document recorded that “the discussion affirmed complete support for the idea of integration and unification from the representatives of all the six nations of the Coal and Steel Community present at the conference.... [There was] some expression by certain European participants of the view that in the economic field, it might be better to proceed through the development of a common market.... A European speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common currency, and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority.... A United States participant confirmed that the United States had not weakened in its enthusiastic support for the idea of integration.... Another United States participant urged his European friends to go ahead with the unification of Europe....” [NOTE: I’ve mentioned before that President Obama’s mentor was Saul Alinsky, who authored Rules For Radicals in 1971 and emphasized “change” as does Obama. Alinsky also urged his followers to emphasize such concepts as liberty, equality and fraternity. These were the watch words of the French Revolution, which was the seedbed for Socialism. Less known is Alinsky’s Reveille For Radicals (1946) in which he promoted the “battle against narrow nationalism.” Relevant to today, President Obama appointed Clinton Assistant Secretary of State and Dean of International Law at Yale Law School, Harold Hongju Koh, as legal advisor to the Department of State. In 2006, Koh presented an essay, “Why Transnational Law Matters” (Penn State Law Review, Spring 2006) in which he addressed “why transnational law is important.” He first referred to Rhodes Scholar selection Philip Jessup’s definition of transnational law in 1956, but he didn’t mention Jessup’s The International Problem of Governing Mankind (1947), in which Jessup proclaimed: “I agree that national sovereignty is the root of the evil.” Koh indicated “transnational law matters... particularly when international law and policies become domesticated into U.S. law and policies.” He also referred to “the U.S. court’s future orientation toward the phenomenon of globalization” and “such topics in transnational public law as the law of global democracy, the law of global governance,...” Regarding the U.S. Supreme Court, Koh explained that “the transnationalist faction – which includes Justices Breyer, Souter, Stevens, Ginsburg, and at times, Justice Kennedy – tends to follow an approach suggested by Justice Blackmun (in 1987): “that U.S. courts must look beyond national interest to the ‘mutual interests of all nations in a smoothly functioning international legal regime’ and must ‘consider if there is a course that furthers, rather than impedes, the development of an ordered international system’.” Thus it seems clear that the principle of maintaining American national sovereignty will be further eroded under President Obama.] Adolph Hitler in the second part of his final “Political Testament” given in Berlin on April 29, 1945 at 4 AM requested that Nazi Party head Martin Bormann and others continue the work of the Nazis after Hitler’s death. He remarked, “Let them be conscious of the fact that our task, that of continuing the building of a National Socialist State, represents the work of the coming centuries, which places every single person"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"under an obligation always to serve the common interest and to subordinate his own advantage to this end.” In the first part of his final “Political Testament,” Hitler had forecast, “From the sacrifice of our soldiers and from my own unity with them unto death, will in any case spring up in the history of Germany, the seed of a radiant renaissance of the National-Socialist [Nazi] movement and thus of the realization of a true community of nations.” While Reichfuehrer SS Heinrich Himmler and Hitler both pursued the cause of National Socialism, Himmler did not pursue a military victory as persistently as did Hitler. In fact, in the second part of Hitler’s “Political Testament,” he expelled Himmler from the Nazi Party because the latter conducted “secret negotiations with the enemy” and for “illegally attempting to seize power in the State.” Was Himmler’s creation of a Nazi underground that would outlast the Third Reich and spread throughout the world part of the Power Elite’s (PE’s) plan? This certainly seems to be the impression one gets when listening to the final statement in the documentary “Himmler’s Castle,” which is as follows: “In the deepest cellar of the west tower is Himmler’s personal safe. Not even the castle’s SS commandants had known of its existence. Several days after the castle was first entered by the Allies, an American special unit blew open the safe and removed the piles of documents and valuables they found inside. The men and the documents then disappeared from history.” This was at the end of the war at the same time concealed SS assets were being shifted by the “Schroder/Dulles network.” PE agent Allen Dulles, head of American intelligence, was on the board of Schroder Finance House which had offices in Hamburg, New York and London, and had great influence in Latin America. Also an agent of the PE, Allen Dulles’ brother, John Foster Dulles, in a speech on October 28, 1939 had already revealed an important part of the PE’s plan: “[There must be] some dilution of sovereignty, to the immediate disadvantage of those nations which now possess the preponderance of power... the establishment of a common money, might be vested in a body created by and responsible to the principle of trading and investing peoples. This would deprive our government of exclusive control over a national money.” Dulles was foretelling the global currency that soon will become a reality. War had come once again “in fierce and exaggerated form” with World War II causing nations to become more willing to sacrifice some of their national sovereignty to a world body of nations. Nazis under Himmler pursued a plan that would come to fruition in perhaps two generations (about now). SS officer Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands began the PE’s sponsored Bilderberg meetings at Oosterbeek May 29-31, 1954. And the Rat Lines mentioned earlier in this series took the infamous Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele to South America in January 1945 to continue his work which emphasized identical twins. In Nick Evans’ “ Nazi angel of death Josef Mengele ‘created twin town in Brazil ’” (London Telegraph , January 23, 2009), he refers to Jorge Camarasa’s new book Mengele: The Angel of Death in South America and quotes Camarasa as saying: “There is testimony that he [Mengele] attended women, followed their pregnancies, treated"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"them with new types of drugs and preparations, that he talked of artificial insemination in human beings, and that he continued working with animals, proclaiming that he was capable of getting cows to produce male twins.” A farmer in Brazil recounted that Mengele (who called himself Rudolph Weiss) “said he could carry out artificial insemination of cows and humans, which we thought impossible as in those days (early 1960s) it was unheard of.” A former mayor of Candido Godoi (Brazil) and town doctor Anencia Flores da Silva recounted testimony that Mengele “attended women who had varicose veins and gave them a potion which he carried in a bottle or tablets which he brought with him,... and everyone remembers he used to take blood.” The town’s first twins were born in 1963, and one in five pregnancies have resulted in (mostly blond- haired and blue-eyed) twins there (typically there are one set of twins in 80 pregnancies in a country). The Nazis never did anything out of mere scientific curiosity, so ask yourself how the ability to create identical twins via artificial insemination might be used in the fulfillment of the secret Nazi plan for today! In Children of the Flames: Dr. Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of Auschwitz (1991), authors Lucette Matalon Lagnado and Sheila Cohn Dekel wrote: “It is believed Mengele was searching for ways to induce multiple births, so as to repopulate the depleted German Army.” But that would take too long, wouldn’t it? Perhaps Mengele’s emphasis on identical twins had more to do with the secret Nazi plan’s provision for succession (who would succeed the first generation of Nazis who went underground). After all, SS officer Mengele didn’t arrive in Auschwitz until May 1943, the exact date the Nazi underground movement began and 6 months after SS Reichsfuerher Himmler privately told Nazi Party head Bormann they may have to capitulate militarily but never must the Nazi Party capitulate. While it’s true that Mengele was trying “to produce an ideal race of Aryan men and women endowed with only the finest genetic traits, who would rapidly multiply and rule the world,” according to Lagnado and Dekel, it’s also true that aspects of Mengele’s research had nothing to do with this. For example, Lagnado and Dekel wrote that Mengele “also attempted to change the sex of some twins.... What was the point of these ghoulish experiments? No one, neither the child-victims nor the adult witnesses, ever really knew.” While sex changes would be largely irrelevant to developing an Aryan race, the change of one male and one female twin to both males or both females would be relevant to the matter of succession in the secret Nazi plan if replacing one identical twin with his brother or her sister at a later date was part of the plan. By 20 years after the time Mengele arrived at Auschwitz, it seems that his technique of producing identical twins had been perfected, as earlier in this article I mentioned the first twins were born in Candido Godoi in 1963 and one in five births since then have been twins. If by 1963 Mengele shared his technique with other Nazis who went underground during World War II, then twins born in the early 1960s under the Nazi’s secret plan today would be 40-50 years old. Succeeding the original underground Nazis “as men of large commercial or financial interests” with a “controlling influence in labor unions, in the banking world, in Chambers of Commerce,” etc., these individuals would"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"be in strategically important positions enabling them to fulfill today the secret Nazi (National Socialist) plan as partially revealed in Sumner Welles’ The Time for Decision . As David Lee Preston wrote in “Hitler’s Swiss Connection” ( The Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine , January 5, 1997), former Nazi Reichsminister of Finance Hjalmar Schacht “was quoted as saying National Socialism would conquer the world without having to wage another war.” Preston also related that the Swiss man who made investments for Schacht after the war, Francois Genoud, wrote in the preface of Hitler’s Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations (Bormann’s account of Hitler’s conversations) that “Hitler wanted the people of the Third World to carry on the work of the Thousand- Year Reich.” This is an important revelation given that these conversations occurred long before the Nazis lost militarily, and most people of the Third World could scarcely be considered the blue-eyed blondes representative of Hitler’s Aryan ideal. The revelation does show the breadth of the Nazi plan and that it included National Socialism even for the Third World. Are we seeing any movement toward National Socialism and the use of eugenics in the U.S.? These are important elements in the PE’s larger plan for population control and a World Socialist Government. And remember that PE agent Sir Julian Huxley (Fabian Socialist and first director-general of UNESCO) in UNESCO: Its Purpose and Its Philosophy (1948) wrote about “the implications of the transfer of full sovereignty from separate nations to a world organization.... Political unification in some sort of world government will be required.... Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.” [NOTE: Does American intelligence awareness of Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan’s contact with Al Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki seem like 9/11 déjà vu to you? Remember that German intelligence believed the CIA had been monitoring 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta in the U.S. long before 9/11. Is that what U.S. intelligence was doing with Major Hasan before the incident at Fort Hood on November 5? And just like after 9/11, don’t be surprised if no one gets fired because this disaster wasn’t prevented when it could have been.] Whenever I talk to people about the secret Nazi plan for today, they say the World War II Nazis are old today and therefore no threat. Besides, they say, the Mossad and others have monitored the Nazis who fled Germany toward the end of the war. But that’s the problem. Those are the Nazis the secret plan wants us to see and monitor. However, the real threat today is from the Nazis who dispersed under the secret plan early in World War II, and this secret Nazi plan included successors to the original Nazis. It’s also important to remember that the Nazis were simply one subpart of a larger effort by the Power Elite (PE) to bring about a World Socialist Government. In previous columns, I’ve mentioned how around 595 B.C., Solon was told by the priests at the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Temple of Isis in Sais, Egypt that the elite Aryans were the only people to survive the destruction of Atlantis (in 1626 Sir Francis Bacon wrote New Atlantis ). About two centuries after Solon, Plato would pick up on the theme of rule by an elite “republic of philosophers” in his book, The Republic (380 B.C.), and he also wrote therein: “If a man had a sickly constitution and intemperate habits, his life was worth nothing to himself or anyone else....” The Nazis would later adopt this same theme with “lebensunwerten Lebens,” life unworthy of being lived. On May 1, 1776, Adam Weishaupt founded the Bavarian Illuminati, a secret society of elitists who conspired to take over the world. They founded student societies at German universities at Tugenbund and Berschenschaften. William H. Russell matriculated through those institutions, and brought back the student societies’ ceremonies and rites to Yale University, establishing in 1832 the elite secret Skull & Bones society which would have elitist swastikas in its building on campus. Forty years later in 1872 jurist Karl Binding would begin teaching at the University of Leipzig (until 1912). Seven years later at the same university, Wilhelm Wundt (whose grandfather Kirchenrat Karl Kasimir Wundt was a member of the Illuminati with the code name “Raphael”) began the first psychological laboratory. Wundt’s first American Ph.D. was G. Stanley Hall, mentor of Socialist and “Father of Progressive Education” John Dewey (“Father of American Psychology” William James also received his Ph.D. from Wundt). Binding and Dr. Alfred Hoche would later author Die Freigabe der Vernichtung lebensunwerten Lebens (Permission for the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life) , which would serve as the basis for the Nazis’ euthanasia program designed to eliminate any “inferior” (non-Aryan, non-elite) human beings. Also, in 1872, Confederate Brig. Gen. Albert Pike (who revised the Scottish Rite of freemasonry) wrote Indo-Aryan Deities and Worship in which he praised Lucifer (as he did in 1871 in Morals and Dogma ). And in the Scottish Rite’s journal New Age (September 1950), C. William Smith wrote about “a new religion of ‘The Great Light’... and the American race will be the sixth Aryan civilization....” Fourteen years after Pike’s 1872 book, Elizabeth Nietzsche (sister of Friedrich Nietzsche) and her husband Bernhard Forster went to Paraguay to found New Germany (see Forgotten Fatherland by Ben MacIntyre) where the Aryan ideal could flourish. She later returned to Germany and became a mentor to Hitler in the early 1900s. At this same time, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger began publishing Birth Control Review in which Nazi Ernst Rudin of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and others) wrote “Eugenic Sterilization: An Urgent Need” in the April 1933 edition. Sanger believed in reducing “dysgenic stock” such as blacks, gypsies, Jews, etc., and so did Rudin and the Nazis. Rudin taught the “Angel of Death,” Josef Mengele, who was interested in identical twins. After WWII, Rudin’s daughter Edith Zerbin Rudin (member of the American Eugenics Society), worked at the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry on a project involving the behavior of twins. Also after WWII, the CIA recruited and deployed five of the Nazi"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"assistants of Adolph Eichmann, who fled to South America with Mengele (see www.democrats.com/node/3167 ) In previous parts of this series, I’ve indicated how I thought Mengele’s research on identical twins was designed to provide succession for the second generation in the secret Nazi plan for today. Also, Mengele’s research on being able to change eye color would fit that same theory so he could make twins appear to be identical if they were simply different in eye color. As I’ve written before in this series, SS leader Heinrich Himmler early in WWII confided to Martin Bormann (Nazi Party chief, May 1941-May 1945) that the Nazis may lose militarily but that the Nazi movement (National Socialism) must never be defeated. That Socialism was a PE goal even before Hitler and the Nazis came to power can be seen from the widely used college reader A Social History of the American Family (Vol. 3, 1919), in which author Arthur Calhoun wrote that “the modern individual is a world citizen” (just as President Obama claims to be). Calhoun went on to say that “The family goes back to the age of savagery while the state belongs to the age of civilization.... As soon as the new family, consisting of only the parents and the children, stood forth, society saw how many were unfit for parenthood and began to realize the need of community care.... The child passes more and more into the custody of community experts.... In the new social order, extreme emphasis is sure to be placed upon eugenic procreation.... It seems clear that at least in its early stages, socialism will mean an increased amount of social control.... We may expect in the socialist commonwealth a system of public educational agencies that will begin with the nursery and follow the individual through life....” The Nazis simply picked up on this theme and instituted eugenic procreation. And relevant to Calhoun’s statement about children and education, Hitler on November 6, 1933 stated: “I calmly say, ‘Your child belongs to us already.... What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time they will know nothing else but this new community.’” And on May 1, 1937 Hitler further declared: “This new Reich will give its youth to no one, but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing.” Remember that the secret Nazi plan was to come to fruition two generations after WWII, and reflect upon Prof. Richard Wexler’s reference in Wounded Innocents (1990) to “child saver” zealots who desire an expansion of government power. Commenting on Wexler’s assertion, psychologist John Rosemond in his syndicated newspaper column subsequently explained: “Implicit to all this liberal scheming is the belief, firmly held by many mental health professionals, that families are closed pathological systems that must, in the best interests of the helpless child-prisoners within, be made subject to state scrutiny, reorganization and management.” But how would these mental health professionals get around parents’ religious claims that God entrusted parents, not society or government, with the care of children? That’s simple. These professionals would just declare a connection between religion and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"mental health problems! For example, North Carolina’s 1980 State Health Plan had already listed religion as a possible socio-economic precursor of mental retardation. Six years after Wexler’s book was published, David Kessler (former federal Food and Drug Administration Commissioner) said on NBC Nightly News (August 23, 1996) that “the government can protect its kids.” Note he didn’t say government would “protect kids,” but rather he placed the possessive adjective “its” before the word “kids.” One might remember this “possessive” attitude when considering that despite laws against forced child labor, many school systems across the U.S. require students to engage in misnamed “voluntary” service in order to graduate from high school. Globally, a U.S. Department of Labor report released September 10, 2009 showed many nations, such as China, used child or forced labor. Products from such labor often are sold in stores frequented by minorities, whom one would think would be especially offended by such labor practices. However, the lack of boycotts of such products shows how successfully the PE has conditioned the buying public. [NOTE: The current push toward National Socialism in the U.S. is via healthcare, but one should remember Ronald Reagan’s 1961 warning: “One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It is very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project. Most people are less reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who can’t possibly afford it.”] It’s useful at this point to show how the secret Nazi plan within the larger Power Elite’s (PE) plan came about over time. In my NewsWithViews column “ What Is the Role of Iran: Part 3 ,” I referred to Herbert Samuel of the Milner Group (executing Cecil Rhodes’ secret plan) appointing Hajj Amin al-Husseini as political administrator of Arab Palestine. Al-Husseini was a close ally of Nazi Germany, and in 1936 he met Swiss Nazi supporter Francois Genoud. They met again in 1941 in Berlin where al-Husseini helped form the Muslim SS-brigade in Bosnia. Also in 1941, Genoud met Nazi SS officer Paul Dickopf (mentioned earlier in this series) with Abwehr (German intelligence), who went underground in 1942 and stayed with Genoud in Lausanne, Switzerland. Although a German agent, Dickopf started working for the U.S. via Allen Dulles’ OSS office in Bern, Switzerland. For 15 years (and during the 1930s), Dulles had been a director of the Schroeder Bank in New York, and according to Prof. Carroll Quigley “the Schroeder Bank in Cologne helped arrange Hitler’s accession to power as chancellor in January 1933.” After WWII, Dickopf rose quickly through the ranks of the Federal Police of West Germany and became head of the BKA (like the American FBI) in 1965, bringing many former Nazi agents with him. He became head of Interpol in 1968 until 1972, which was the year Nazi Kurt Waldheim became UN Secretary-General until 1982. In 1953, CIA director Allen Dulles (Council on Foreign Relations president 1946-1950) funded the overthrow of the elected Mossadegh government in Iran. In Zurich in 1951 an organization called the New European Order had been formed and would be led by Swiss Nazi Gaston-Armand Amaudruz. Several hundred Nazis were in Egypt in the 1950s, and in 1958 Genoud founded the Arab Commercial Bank (ACB). Hitler’s"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Reichsminister of Finance Hjalmar Schacht (mentioned in Part 4 of this series) helped set up the ACB and at one of its meetings proclaimed: “Germany can conquer the world without waging war.” Of course, that was the purpose of the secret Nazi plan. Swiss officials believed Genoud also founded the Lugano-based al-Taqwa Bank, reputedly a funding conduit for al-Qaeda and Hamas until 2002 when the bank was closed. Much of the above information came from Christoph Fringeli’s January 28, 2009 Internet posting on Francois Genoud, and Fringeli’s main source was Karl Laske’s 1996 book Ein Leben zwischen Hitler und Carlos: Francois Genoud. As I’ve written before, the ultimate goal of the PE is a World Socialist Government, and in that regard many conditioning devices have been developed. I’ve written previous columns about conditioning via music and remember, regarding the popular song “If I Had A Hammer,” that the famous Fabian Socialist window shows a hammer striking the world upon an anvil with the slogan “Remould it nearer to the hearts desire.” Also remember that the artist Bertold Brecht commented that “Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.” And concerning conditioning via television and movies, reflect upon the fact that Dr. David Hubel (mentioned by New Ager Marilyn Ferguson in her The Aquarian Conspiracy ) has described his research regarding the brain and vision, and how a line projected on a screen and tilted a certain way can cause the firing of a particular brain cell. Hubel then related this knowledge to a newborn child’s learning process. Relevant to the PE’s ultimate goal, Lord Christopher Monckton (former science advisor to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) on October 14, 2009 at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota warned that signing the new climate change treaty in Copenhagen in early December will impose a “world government.” And that the Obama administration has Socialist leanings in terms of government can be inferred from National Economic Council director Larry Summers’ White House blog referring extensively and positively to John Maynard Keynes, a leading Socialist of the 20th century (see online Wall Street Journal article by Phil Izzo, September 22, 2009). The self-proclaimed “world citizen” President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 on October 9, in part because the Nobel Committee said “his diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world’s population.” Concerning this, one might reflect upon the fact that the majority of the world’s population lives in Socialist countries. One might also reflect upon the fact that in his April 5, 2009 speech in Prague, Czech Republic, President Obama used the phrase “we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.” Regarding this, note that in William Butler Yeats’ “The Second Coming” (January 1919) one reads that, “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world; ...Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand....”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In his speech in the Czech Republic, President Obama also said “the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons.” What this would mean is that the world would return to the bloodbaths resulting from conventional wars prior to nuclear weapons. China with its huge conventional army, for example, would no longer be deterred militarily from conducting warfare. As I have explained before, the Nazis were simply a subpart of a larger Power Elite (PE) plan for world domination. And to find out who funded Hitler, you might read James and Suzanne Pool’s Who Financed Hitler: The Secret Funding of Hitler’s Rise to Power 1919-1933 . Before WWII, John J. McCloy was an attorney for IG Farben (German chemical company), and as the war ended McCloy helped many Nazis avoid prosecution. For example, the infamous Klaus Barbie and others reportedly were sent to the 370th Counter Intelligence Corps at Oberammergau where Private Henry Kissinger (McCloy’s protégé) was located. In Part 2 of this series, I mentioned Nazi General Reinhard von Gehlen who was Hitler’s chief intelligence officer. With the war’s end, the Gehlen Organization (GO) began working for the U.S., with Allen Dulles’ CIA giving the GO hundreds of millions of dollars. In turn, Gehlen helped Dulles (operating out of Bern, Switzerland) to overthrow the elected Mossadegh government in Iran in 1953. Gehlen’s chief man and successor in the U.S. was SS officer Otto Albrecht von Bolschawing, who in 1969 worked for TCI which had classified Defense Department contracts. Nazi spy George de Mohrenschildt was also in the U.S. after WWII. He was a member of the “White Russian” (anti-Communist) community and befriended Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. De Mohrenschildt was found shot in 1977 on the day a U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations investigator was to see him. Attorney Mark Lane in Plausible Denial asserts that de Mohrenschildt was a CIA contract agent. Whenever I write about a secret Nazi plan for a coming World Socialist Government, there will be those who say that’s a lot of conspiracy nonsense. However, one should remember a couple of things pertaining to this. First, the government lies to us. In this regard, note the last sentence of the first paragraph in the 1971 letter ( link here ) from California Assemblyman E. Richard Barnes to President Nixon. Secondly, it’s not paranoia to say the government has been monitoring me, because I witnessed it when I was in the federal government. I had thought the government was monitoring my phone calls, so one day I didn’t hang up when the other party did. Then I stayed silently on the phone for several minutes, determined to outwait my monitors. Finally, two voices came on the line – one saying “I guess he hanged up” and the other jokingly agreeing with him! In Part 3 of this series, I mentioned that Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels in 1940 said that in the future “people will no longer think in terms of countries... [but"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"rather] in terms of continents.” Relevant to this, Reuters on November 4, 2009 reported Czech president Vaclav Klaus finally reluctantly signed the Lisbon Treaty creating “a new, full-time president of the EU and foreign minister” and internal changes to the EU’s system of lawmaking which will “mean individual countries will have a harder time blocking EU legislation.” Klaus explained that “the Czech Republic will cease to be a sovereign state” after the treaty goes into effect on December 1, 2009. Continents like Europe with the EU then will be economically and politically merged and managed by a World Socialist Government. Relevant to that, Howard Fineman in Newsweek (October 19, 2009) authored “President of Planet Earth,” in which he wrote: “Obama isn’t going to be sworn in as planetary president. But it doesn’t matter; in his mind, he already is.” Concerning global economics, Fineman noted that “we cannot revive our economy... without the coordination that world leaders talked about at the G20 in Pittsburgh.” This “coordination” will become “management” of the global economy by a World Socialist Government. The next step in this plan is the first “test” global currency, which is the result of a United Future World Currency initiative that began in 1996 in Italy by Sandro Sassoli. It was based upon advice by CFR member Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., who had written in Partisan Review (May-June 1947): “There seems to be no inherent obstacle to the gradual advance of socialism in the United States through a series of New Deals.... The transition must be piecemeal....” Years, later, Schlesinger wrote in the CFR’s Foreign Affairs (July-August 1995): “We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words and money.” The Royal Mint of Belgium was the first to issue a test coin for the new currency, which will be given a final name and symbol via a competition by children in 1000 schools throughout the world. Don’t be surprised if the name and symbol just happen to be the ones (“The Phoenix”) to which I have referred many times, and which can be seen on the cover of The Economist for January 9, 1988. To show you how long this plan has been operational, reflect upon the fact that The Economist said “The Phoenix” was planned for 2018. And in “The demise of the dollar” ( The Independent , October 6, 2009), Robert Fisk wrote: “In the most profound change in recent Middle East history, Gulf Arabs are planning – along with China, Russia, Japan and France – to end dollar dealings for oil, moving instead to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan, the euro, gold and a new, unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council, including Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Qatar. Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and central bank governors in Russia, China, Japan and Brazil to work on the scheme, which will mean that oil will no longer be priced in dollars.... Chinese financial sources believe President Barack Obama is too busy fixing the U.S. economy to concentrate on the extraordinary implications of the transition from the dollar in nine years’ time. The current deadline for the currency transition is 2018.” Thus, the demise of the dollar as an international exchange currency is imminent. In “China alarmed by U.S. money printing” ( The Telegraph , September 6, 2009), a top"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chinese Communist Party member, Cheng Siwei, warned: “If they [the U.S.] keep printing money to buy bonds it will lead to inflation, and after a year or two the dollar will fall hard. Most of our foreign reserves are in U.S. bonds and this is very difficult to change, so we will diversify incremental resources into euros, yen, and other currencies.” Siwei also was quoted as saying, “Greenspan went wrong from 2000-2004 [because] he thought everything was all right because inflation was low, but assets absorbed the liquidity.” And referring to the U.S. constantly borrowing and going into debt to China and others, Siwei quoted Ben Franklin: “He who goes borrowing, goes sorrowing.” Yes, there really has been a PE plan to bring about a World Socialist Government. And yes, there really has been a secret Nazi plan scheduled for fulfillment today which was part of the larger PE plan. One can even see how people today have already accepted certain aspects of the Nazi mentality. For example, on November 5, 1996 The New York Times published a front-page article titled “Ban on Medical Experiments Without Consent is Relaxed” by Gina Kolata, which begins: “For the first time in half a century, new Federal regulations allow investigators to enroll patients in some medical research studies without their consent.... Even the most ardent supporters of the new regulations say they understand the seriousness of what they have done. They have repealed a principle that dates back to the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi doctors after WWII.” The Nuremberg Code stated, “The voluntary consent of the human subject is essential.” Unfortunately, many people don’t read today, but they will watch a movie. So, I sent the information regarding the secret Nazi plan to Chloe Dan with Steven Speilberg, but received a reply “we are returning your material herewith unread.” At least I tried to prevent the coming death of tens of millions of people. Lastly, if you want some indication that the Nazi movement, which was thought to be dead, is still alive via a secret plan, reflect upon the possible meaning of Revelation 17, which refers to “the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.” [Note: My book September 11 Prior Knowledge was perhaps the first book published about that tragedy. In the book I wrote: “One might also reasonably ask how Ali Mohammed could train Green Berets, then work for the CIA before working for the FBI in Sacramento from 1992-1996, and yet the U.S. government knew nothing of his involvement in the bombing of the World Trade Center and the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania before they occurred?” People today are asking where Ali Mohammed is! We know where Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed are incarcerated, but not Ali Mohammed. At the end of this note, I will suggest where he might be. Ali Mohammed is perhaps the real mastermind behind a lot of the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks in which a number of “mistakes” were made. But what if they were not “mistakes”? What if they were rather planned to be limited in their toll?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"For example, in the first World Trade Center (WTC) attack, even barely competent terrorists would have early in the morning of the attack occupied the parking space next to the key support column, so the explosive-laden van could be parked there later that day. And on 9/11, if the planes had hit the WTC only an hour later, thousands more would have died. Or if the four planes had instead flown into football stadiums holding 70,000 fans each, tens of thousands more would have died. Or if 19 terrorists from midnight to 5 AM had motorcycled through the backroads of the nation tossing incendiary devices into heavily wooded areas, it would have brought the U.S. to its knees. But none of these alternatives occurred! What if they were not meant to occur? What if Ali Mohammed only wanted limited damage? In CIA agent Robert Baer’s See No Evil , he related that one of the highest ranking CIA officials told a reporter friend of his “that when the dust finally clears, Americans will see that September 11 was a triumph for the intelligence community, not a failure.” Think about that! Perhaps Ali Mohammed is in a “safe place” along with Timothy McVeigh. You have been told McVeigh was executed? Perhaps he was. But then why did a woman present at the execution say that she saw his chest rising and falling even after he was pronounced dead?] I’ve mentioned several times in this series that Nazi SS officer Paul Dickopf in 1968 became head of Interpol (International Criminal Police Organization, founded in 1923). Rather than simply relate events and personages, it is also important to analyze and question what transpired. Since Israel had existed as a nation for twenty years by 1968, it’s hard to imagine the Israelis would not be aware of Dickopf’s past and object to his occupying such an important position as head of Interpol. So what happened? Remember that Lord Alfred Milner, who executed Cecil Rhodes’ “scheme to take the government of the whole world,” opposed the establishment of the nation of Israel. In 1940, President Roosevelt appointed Nelson Rockefeller coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (in 1944, F.D.R. appointed him Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs). According to The Secret War Against the Jews by John Loftus and Mark Aarons, there are transcripts of telephone conversations between Nelson Rockefeller and Nazi agents in South America in 1943 showing he arranged the sale of tons of petroleum products to Nazi Germany. Moreover, there is “evidence of his complicity in helping Allen Dulles smuggle criminals and money from the Vatican to Argentina.” When confronted in 1947 with this evidence as well as “his Swiss bank records with the Nazis and his signature on correspondence setting up the German cartel in South American,” Rockefeller agreed to provide the Latin American block of votes for admission of Israel to the UN (March 1947, John D. Rockefeller III presented UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie with a check for 8.5 million dollars to purchase land for the UN headquarters in New York City). These votes were in exchange for a guarantee that the Zionists would not reveal “the flow of Nazi money and fugitives to South America. There would be no Zionist-Nazi hunting unit, no testimony at Nuremberg about the bankers or anyone else, not a single leak to the press about where"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the Nazis were living in South America or which Nazis were working for Dulles,” such as Dickopf. In 1942, Dickopf began working for Power Elite (PE) agent Allen Dulles in Berne, Switzerland. It’s difficult to believe Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler would send a potentially treasonous officer to Switzerland, so think about the possible explanations for what was really happening. A young Allen Dulles had been collecting information on Germany and the Austro- Hungarian Empire even since WWI. While he worked for the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell from 1927 to 1941, he worked with some key Nazi industrialists including some with I.G. Farben. From 1942-1945, he was station chief of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Berne, Switzerland. According to Hugh Thomas’ The Strange Death of Heinrich Himmler (2001): “Allen Dulles had spent many years cultivating important social and business contacts in Germany. As a young lawyer after the first World War, he had joined his brother John Foster at Versailles, where they advised on war reparations while spinning a web of business connections through Gerhard Westrick and influential German banking colossus Kurt von Schroder. Dulles had secretly conspired with the huge conglomerate DuPont to ship munitions to Germany in violation of the sanctions against German rearmament. As he was in charge of determining how much Germany should pay the Allies, Dulles was an expert on sanctions. Consequently, he was in the best possible position to help DuPont evade sanctions; he knew every loophole and how to present the paperwork to ensure that imports escaped scrutiny. Working from his office in Berne for the OSS... his assistant was Gero Schulz von Gavernitz... who lent his support to [Helmuth James] von Moltke’s resistance [to Hitler] group, the Kreisau Circle.” Von Moltke’s father was head of the German General Staff in WWII, and his mother was Dorothy Rose-Innes whose father, Sir James Rose-Innes, was a South African member of Cecil Rhodes’ Association of Helpers. And according to Carroll Quigley’s The Anglo- American Establishment, “The Round Table for June 1946 makes perfectly clear to those who can read between the lines that Moltke became a member of the Milner Group,” which executed Rhodes’ secret “scheme to take the government of the whole world.” Moltke was also a member of Rhodes’ Association of Helpers, as was resistance (to Hitler) movement member Adam von Trott zu Solz (German Rhodes Scholar). Quigley noted that “it is not without significance that one of the chief projects which the [resistance] plotters hoped to further in post-Hitler German foreign policy was a ‘federation of Europe in a commonwealth not unlike the British empire’” (see my comment earlier in this series that the Nazis planned for an eventual European Union). Hugh Thomas asserted that beginning in March and April 1943, Dulles’ assistant von Gavernitz began meeting in Switzerland with Himmler’s emissaries, as did British agents. The plan, called “the SS solution,” was that Hitler would be put under house arrest in Berchtesgaden, and a de facto government under Himmler’s control would take over, end the war in the West, and concentrate on defeating the Bolsheviks in the East. Thomas wrote: “Walter Monckton, who ran Churchill’s private intelligence service, went"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"on a lecture tour to Stockholm, and was introduced to von Moltke, who spelled out the terms of the agreement.” I’ve mentioned before that Allen Dulles enlisted the help of the Gehlen Organization (GO) in toppling the elected Mossadegh government in Iran in 1953. The GO was named for Nazi Brig. Gen. Reinhard Gehlen who was chief of intelligence for the Nazis’ “Foreign Armies East.” Gehlen had become a member of the German General Staff in 1935, becoming a Major in 1939. Remember here that it was the German General Staff to whom U.S. diplomat Sumner Welles referred when writing about the secret Nazi plan that could come to fruition today. The head of the OSS, William (Wild Bill) Donovan and Allen Dulles worked to bring Gehlen and three of his top people to the U.S., which occurred on September 20, 1945. The GO started with about 250 Nazi intelligence agents and later grew to about 4000 members. The CIA and the GO cooperated on a number of ventures, and early training occurred at a camp in Oberammergau where Private Henry Kissinger was during WWII. Kissinger was mentored by PE member Nelson Rockefeller (mentioned earlier), who was on friendly terms with the Nazis and other Fascists. PE member David Rockefeller was/is on friendly terms with the Communists (Chinese, Cuban, etc.). This is how the dialectic process works in moving us toward a world government. In a series of lectures on “The Future of Federalism” at Harvard University in 1962, Nelson Rockefeller said: “The nation-state is becoming less and less competent to perform its international political tasks. These are some of the reasons pressing us to lead vigorously toward the true building of a new world order.... Sooner perhaps than we may realize,... there will evolve the bases for a federal structure of the free world.” Nelson’s son, Steven Rockefeller, coordinated the drafting process for the “Earth Charter” for Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong. Its provisions were completed in March 2000 and included a call for promotion of “an equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations.” Gorbachev and Strong both stated the Charter would be like a new Ten Commandments. Then in 2002, David Rockefeller in his Memoirs admitted: “We [Rockefeller family] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States,... and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will.” The synthesis of this dialectic can be seen in PE agent George H.W. Bush, who was probably a Dulles OSS agent in WWII (in 1959 Dulles was CIA director, and Bush’s ship Barbara was described in an FBI memo as “a CIA asset”). In the 1970s, Bush was U.S. Ambassador to Communist China, and later as president he supported Most Favored Nation trading status for them. But according to Brig. Gen. Russell Bowen in The Immaculate Deception: The Bush Crime Family Exposed and Russ Bellant in Old Nazis, The New Right and the Republican Party , at the same time he was president, Bush was close to World War II Nazi sympathizers such as Lazslo Pasztor (member of Hungary’s Nazi-like party called the Arrow Cross) and Yaroslav Stesko, who was a known war criminal heading a Ukrainian Nazi puppet regime during WWII. This is similar to PE agent John J. McCloy sitting in Nazi leader Hitler’s box at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and then decades later swimming in the Black Sea with Communist Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. (For more information relevant to these subjects, see"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Christopher Simpson’s Blowback: America’s Recruitment of Nazis and its Effect on the Cold War .) What’s all this got to do with the secret Nazi plan? The GO operated around the world, and therefore could have included Nazis facilitating the secret plan. The plan, which was to be executed over two generations, would have needed some global network of Nazis to provide communication and coordination over the years. And we know that at least one member of the GO, Alois Brunner (Nazi head of the Drancy Internment Camp near Paris, and culpable for the death of 140,000 Jews), was thought to be still alive in 2007, though it isn’t known if he was part of the secret Nazi plan. Gehlen in 1944 had anticipated the defeat of the Nazis and developed a plan to help later SS officers escape after being captured. The escape network was called Die Spinne, and Gehlen worked with SS Lt. Col. Otto Skorzeny. They helped about 600 officers, including Dr. Josef Mengele, escape mainly to Latin America, where Skorzeny eventually located (in Argentina). [Note: In my Note at the beginning of Part 8 in this series, I asked if Al Qaeda mastermind Ali Mohammed only wanted limited damage in his planned attacks. And I referred to CIA operative Robert Baer’s quote about 9/11 being “a triumph for the intelligence community, not a failure.” Relevant to this, remember we are told Osama bin Laden is sickly man on a dialysis machine hiding in a mountain cave in northwest Pakistan. But also remember that in an interview with Gen. Mike Hayden (head of the National Security Agency at the time) on CBS’s “60 Minutes II” (February 13, 2001), seven months before 9/11, Gen. Hayden revealed that “Osama bin Laden has at his disposal the wealth of a $3 trillion-a-year telecommunications industry that he can rely on.... He has better technology available to him [than does the NSA].” One of the investors in the Iridium global satellite system is the Saudi Binladen Group, and US News & World Report (November 8, 1999) reported that the Pentagon planned increasingly to use private satellite companies like Iridium for much of its communications. Think about all of the above.] At the end of Part 8 , I mentioned how the Gehlen Organization (GO) and Die Spinne helped Nazi SS officers, including Dr. Josef Mengele, escape to Latin America after World War II. Therefore, at this point, it would be instructive to examine exactly how the network worked in facilitating someone like Mengele to escape. In Mengele (1986) by Gerald Posner and John Ware, they noted that Mengele was actually in an American prison camp for two months at the end of WWII. The authors wrote: “Although there is no evidence of collusion between the American authorities and Mengele, the fact remains that this notorious war criminal was held for two months and never identified as the ‘principal war criminal’ on the ‘wanted’ list.” Perhaps Posner and Ware should have checked the relation between Gehlen and Allen Dulles! At the American prison camp, a Dr. Fritz Ulmann (also a prisoner) whom “the Americans had assigned to the prison staff of the main camp administrative office, where release papers were processed,” provided Mengele with release papers. Once out of prison, Ulmann’s brother-in-law, though not a Nazi, secreted Mengele on a farm in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Bavaria. In 1949, former SS contacts in Gunzburg helped Mengele escape Germany, along with “a small suitcase filled with scientific specimens” from his Auschwitz experiments (perhaps with identical twins research). A friend named “Kurt” acquired an International Red Cross passport for Mengele. Posner and Ware wrote: “The International Red Cross file on Josef Mengele was shrouded in secrecy for forty years after the war.” Remember, the Red Cross has been used as cover for U.S. government operations, as in American Red Cross representative Raymond Robins literally forcing Lenin to dismiss Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs Ivan Zalkind. Mengele was to leave Genoa on the North King ship which was to depart for Argentina on May 25, 1949, but he was arrested on May 22 for not having a proper Italian exit visa. After three weeks, he was released and the North King was still at the dock (how many ships have you heard of that are three weeks behind their departure date?). He embarked for Buenos Aires in mid-July 1949. After ten years in Argentina, he settled in Paraguay by May 1959. Posner and Ware noted the lack of effective cooperation by the West German police and Interpol in pursuing Mengele. One should remember at this point that former SS officer Paul Dickopf and other Nazis were active in the West German Federal Police (BKA, German Federal Criminal Police Office, formed in 1951) for some time after WWII, and Dickopf became head of Interpol from 1968-1972. Posner and Ware wrote: “Certainly for most of the 1960s and much of the 1970s, the West German government led everyone to believe that Mengele was likely to be in Paraguay.” However, the truth was that by late October 1960, Mengele had left Paraguay for Brazil where he would live until his death on February 7, 1979 near Sao Paulo. In Part 4 of this series, I referred to Mengele and the twins of Candido Godoi, Brazil in the early 1960s. About six months after I wrote that, National Geographic News on November 25, 2009 published “’Nazi Twins’ a Myth: Mengele Not Behind Brazil Boom?” about a National Geographic documentary aired November 29. The article and documentary indicated a high rate of twinning existed in Candido Godoi long before Mengele arrived, that most of the twins were non-identical, and that there was no surge in twinning in the early 1960s when Mengele was there. Gary Steinman (a twinning expert at Long Island Jewish Medical Center) is also quoted as saying: “Even if Mengele had ovulation induction drugs available, they would have had an effect only on the immediate recipients for one generation.” Therefore, this would not have produced the successive generations of Aryans for the army the Nazis desired. Steinman also “suspects a role for a growth hormone-produced protein called IGF which he’s previously linked to twinning in both cows and humans.” The problem with what National Geographic is studying is that they don’t understand what Mengele’s purpose may have been. Mengele was primarily interested in identical twins. In Brazil, he talked of “artificial insemination in human beings, that he was capable of getting cows to produce male twins,... and everyone remembers he used to take blood” (London Telegraph , January 23, 2009). If Mengele was only interested in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"being able to produce a set of twins for succession (explained in earlier Parts of this series) in the secret Nazi plan, he would not have been interested in producing multi- generational twinning. Secondly, if he was interested in being able to produce identical rather than non-identical twins, that would not have resulted in a surge in the rate of twinning. Thirdly, the fact that “everyone remembers he used to take blood” may mean he was trying to find the relation of IGF levels to the production of male identical twins. This would be to fulfill the secret Nazi plan’s provision for a second generation to succeed the original Nazi agents who went underground. If he found this relation of IGF levels, that information could have been shared globally with other Nazi scientists secretly dispersed via the GO. One question relevant to today regards the possible role of Iran in the secret Nazi plan. Prior to WWII, the Shah of Iran admired Hitler, Nazism and Aryanism so much that in 1935 he changed the name of Persia to Iran, which in Farsi means Aryan. During WWII, Germany’s envoy to the Middle East was a member of the Gestapo named Fritz Grobba, who promised a Pan-Arab crescent from Casablanca (Morocco) to Tehran (Iran). After the Nazi surrender in Mary, 1945, Nazi Brig. Gen. Reinhard Gehlen and his top aides were at Fort Hunt, Virginia on September 20, 1945 making a deal with OSS head William Donovan (and Allan Dulles) for them to use the GO (Nazis and SS officers) operating out of Pullach, Germany. Part of the deal called for the GO in ten years (1955) to become the West German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), and Gehlen operatives served therein for decades. This raises the question of whether GO agents have operated for decades, and perhaps even today, in Iran, threatening to destabilize the region. Remember, the Power Elite (PE) uses crises to further its goals. And just as Lincoln Bloomfield wrote about the need to maintain a “Communist dynamic” against the West to incentivize acceptance of a world government, could the “Iranian (radical Muslim) dynamic” be used to incentivize Israel’s acceptance of world government? In 1953, the GO helped the CIA (Allan Dulles and Kermit Roosevelt) overthrow the elected Mossadegh government in Iran, installing the Shah as leader of the country with Nazi collaborator Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi as Prime Minister. Zahedi then signed 25-year leases on 40 percent of Iran’s oil with 3 American companies, one of which was Gulf Oil, which a few years later made Kermit Roosevelt a vice-president! Another subject to contemplate is what happened to Heinrich Himmler. Could it be that his secret vault in his castle was found by an American secret team (that disappeared along with the vault’s contents) because Himmler told them where to look? Could the secret team have been sent by Allan Dulles, and could the documents have shown Himmler’s cooperation with Dulles years before the war ended? And also consider the possibility that the corpse of Himmler found while in Allied custody really wasn’t Himmler (the British placed a 100-year ban on seeing documents about his “suicide” by cyanide). For information concerning discrepancies about the X-rays, dental records, dueling scar, etc., of Himmler and the corpse, read Hugh Thomas’s The Strange Death of Heinrich Himmler ."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Also in this book, one reads that the Red House report (mentioned earlier in my series) “disclosed that Heinrich Himmler commanded the finances of Reich, one of the greatest bargaining tools of the 20th century. He was in a position not only to negotiate the Reich’s future but also his own survival, ready to engage in final discussions with Allied Intelligence.... Himmler assiduously arranged the transfer of a huge chunk of Nazi Germany’s assets abroad, [and] his long-term aim was to reinvest this capital and expertise in building a new Fourth Reich that would arise, phoenix-like, from the skeleton of the SS ‘state within a state,’ to be governed by a hardcore of the elite.” Remember that the new global currency planned for 2018 A.D. is called “the Phoenix.” If Himmler actually did not die at the end of WWII he could have guided the secret Nazi plan for decades after WWII since he was born October 7, 1900 A.D. Whenever I ask scholars about the secret Nazi plan described by Sumner Welles, they say “There’s no evidence” the plan actually existed. Notice they don’t say the plan didn’t exist, but that “there’s no evidence” of it. Relevant to these scholars’ dismissive attitude regarding the secret Nazi plan, it is important to remember that “official historians (those chosen by the British government to look at carefully selected archive material and produce reports and books for public consumption) have been reluctant to acknowledge that the Red House report ever existed, let alone admit the possibility that its contents might be genuine or significant.” This is according to Hugh Thomas, who added that “two who were involved in handling the Red House report when it first came into Allied hands continued to deny its very existence until the day its yellowing pages were released, somewhat belatedly, in 1996 from Washington’s archives under the Freedom of Information Act.” [Note: Regarding the political Left’s attempted deification of President Obama, on December 28, 2009 the Danish newspaper Politiken published an editorial “Obama Greater Than Jesus” proclaiming Obama “the practical savior of our times.” And here in the U.S., associate editor of Smith College’s The Sophian , Maggie Mertens, on September 18, 2008 wrote “‘I Will Follow Him’: Obama as My Personal Jesus,” in which she proclaimed: “Yes, I just said it. Obama is my Jesus.... I’ve officially been saved, and soon, whether they like it or not, the rest of the country will be too.... In the name of Obama, amen.” Concerning another matter, on April 28, 1997 Secretary of Defense William Cohen revealed that there are those who are “engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.” About what specific terrorists was he talking, and how could they use electromagnetic waves to set off earthquakes?] In part 8 of this series , I mentioned the connection between Nelson Rockefeller and the Nazis. In March 1942, the U.S. Attorney-General’s office revealed that next to the Rockefeller’s stock in Jersey Standard Oil Company, the second largest shareholder was the Nazi-controlled I.G. Farben. Building on this, Nazi Party head, Martin Bormann working with Himmler’s SS and others, initiated Aktion Adlerflug or Operation Eagle Flight using stocks, bonds, gold, etc. to create or control corporations in Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Argentina. According to Paul Manning (a CBS"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"journalist during WWII) in Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile , Bormann “utilized every known device to disguise their [750 corporations] ownership and their patterns of operation: use of nominees, option agreements, pool agreements, endorsements in blank, escrow deposits, pledges, collateral loans, rights of first refusal, management contracts, service contracts, patent agreements, cartels, and withholding procedures.” But who would manage all these corporations over the long term? According to Curt Riess in The Nazis Go Underground (Spring 1944, before D-Day), the Heimschulen (home schools) in the Spring of 1943 had their curriculum changed slightly so that “instead of developing spies and saboteurs, these schools were put to the task of developing workers for the underground.” Riess also explained that many SS members were “sheep dipped,” seemingly resigning from and disavowing the Nazi Party. Riess continued: “What has not yet become known is that all this applies to a much greater number of anonymous persons all over Germany, those on the second and third levels of the Nazi strata.... Party functionaries who may be known locally, but certainly not nationally, can easily be transferred to another city or town, where they will suddenly appear as anti-Nazis. The Party helps in their masquerades. These men get new documents which ‘prove’ that they have always been anti-Nazi. Notes are inserted in their personal files saying they must be watched on account of their anti-Hitler attitudes and ‘unworthy’ behavior. Some of them will undoubtedly be sent to concentration camps for crimes which they have never committed, but which will make them look dependable in the eyes of the Allies; some have perhaps already succeeded in joining anti-Nazi circles and are pretending to conspire against Hitler. Later on they will be able to use such activities as alibis.” In addition to Himmler and Bormann directing the secret Nazi plan, there were others of importance. Konstantin Hierl of the Ministry of Economics in July 1943 delivered a speech in Munich to key members of the Reich Labor Service stating that “we must decentralize to such a degree that we must seem to have disappeared.” Riess explained: “There will be no connections between the different cells, no go-betweens, for many years after the party has submerged.... The members of the cells will not know anything about the members of any other cells, not even that any other cells exist. Only a few leaders who will not be in Germany will have complete knowledge of how many men (200,000- 300,000) are available and where they are... hidden away within German plants, factories, city administrations, etc.” According to Riess, since May 16, 1943, the individuals primarily responsible for selecting members of the cells were SS Gen. Fritz Kaltenbrunner and SS Gen. Werner Heissmeyer. Another institution of political education besides the Heimschulen were the Ordensburgen. In the Swedish newspaper Aftontidningen (October 13, 1943), one reads that these schools instructed their students how to act “if extremely great distress should afflict the country.” Riess indicated that the Nazi Ordensburgen prepared agents to go underground who would “be physically fit young men... who speak a number of foreign languages fluently and, if possible, at least one without any trace of accent. They are also taught... how to behave in a number of countries in such a way as not to be immediately recognized as having been ‘made in Germany’.”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Riess also revealed that the German branch of the Red Cross “can provide an ideal front for the Nazi underground,” and that “undoubtedly Himmler has already taken measures to plant some of his best men in the Criminal Police and the regular uniformed police.” In his conclusion, Riess warned in 1944 that “if we don’t stamp out the Nazi underground, it will make itself felt all over the world; in this country too.” A primary destination for the Nazi underground was Argentina, and one would think denying the Nazis communications with their contacts there would be important. However, according to Glen Yeadon and John Hawkins in The Nazi Hydra in America , President Truman’s chief science advisor, RCA chief David Sarnoff, at the end of WWII approved of RCA (through its subsidiary Transradio) maintaining “a radio link between Buenos Aires and Berlin for the Nazis.” The next year (1946), Richard Nixon ran for Congress, and his law firm Bewley, Kroop, and Nixon received a $2 million fee from Romanian Nazi Nicolae Malaxa which helped Nixon get elected. Malaxa had been a business partner of Hermann Goering (head of the Nazi air force) and worked for the Gestapo before setting up a company in Nixon’s hometown of Whittier, California, according to John Loftus and Mark Aarons in The Secret War Against the Jews (1994). Allen Dulles and Nixon worked together, and in 1947 when the OSS was being transformed into the CIA, Henry Kissinger was Dulles’ translator and later President Nixon’s Secretary of State. The next year (1948) in August, President Harry Truman adopted National Security Council (NSC) document number 20, which included Operation Bloodstone. This Operation lasted from 1948 to 1950 and brought Nazi collaborators to the U.S. “as intelligence and covert operations experts,” according to Christopher Simpson in Blowback: America’s Recruitment of Nazis and its Disastrous Effect on Our Domestic and Foreign Policy (1988). Simpson continued: “Some of them eventually became U.S. agent spotters for sabotage and assassination missions. The men and women enlisted under Bloodstone were not low-level thugs, concentration camp guards, or brutal hoodlums, at least not in the usual sense of those words. Quite the contrary, they were the cream of the Nazis and collaborators, the leaders, the intelligence specialists, and the scholars who had put their skills to work for the Nazi cause.” Regarding the CIA’s work with Nazis, John Loftus in “The Muslim Brotherhood, Nazis and Al Qaeda” ( Jewish Community News , October 4, 2004) revealed that many of the Nazis he had been assigned to prosecute when working for the U.S. Attorney-General were on the CIA payroll. He found this information literally buried in U.S. government vaults underground in Suitland, Maryland. In those vaults, Loftus also found the CIA has volumes of files on the Muslim Brotherhood, “a fascist organization that was hired by Western intelligence that evolved over time into what we today know as al-Qaeda.” In the 1930s, “the Muslim Brotherhood became a secret arm of Nazi intelligence,” according to Loftus, who seems somewhat surprised that “at the end of WWII... instead of prosecuting the Nazis—the Muslim Brotherhood—the British government hired them. They brought all the fugitive Nazi war criminals of Arab and Muslim descent into Egypt,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and for three years they were trained on a special mission. The British Secret Service wanted to use the fascists of the Muslim Brotherhood to strike down the infant state of Israel in 1948.... What the British did then, they sold the Arab Nazis to the predecessor of what became the CIA.” Loftus wouldn’t have been surprised at this if he knew the connections between the British and Jamal Eddine al-Afghani going back to the 1870s; if he knew Afghani’s influence on Mohammed Abduh whose ideas influenced Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 1928; if he knew that Lord Alfred Milner (who executed Cecil Rhodes’ secret plan “to take the government of the whole world”) told the British House of Lords in 1923 that there must never be a Jewish nation in the Middle East; and if he knew that Herbert Samuel, who was a member of the Milner Group that controlled British foreign affairs for most of the 20th century prior to WWII, in 1921 appointed Hajj (Muhammed Effendi) Amin al-Husseini as Mufti and head political administrator of Arab Palestine even though he had killed many Jews (al-Husseini would become a Nazi ally). Loftus explained that “during the 1950s, the CIA evacuated the Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood to Saudi Arabia [where] some of the leading lights of the Muslim Brotherhood like [Abdullah Yusuf] Azzam became the teachers in the Madrasses, the religious schools. And there they combined the doctrines of Nazism with this weird Islamic cult, Wahabbiism.... [In these schools] there was a young student who paid attention—and Azzam’s student was named Osama bin Laden.... In 1979, the CIA decided to take the Arab Nazis out of cold storage,... [and] told the Saudis that we would fund them if they would bring all of the Arab Nazis together and ship them off to Afghanistan to fight the Russians.... We called them the Maktab al Khidimat il Mujahideen, the MAK.” Loftus again seemed surprised that after “Azzam and his assistant, Osama bin Laden,” won the war against the Russians in 1989, the CIA “left this army of Arab fascists in the field of Afghanistan.” Perhaps he wouldn’t have been surprised if he read The Grand Chessboard (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who lured the Soviets into Afghanistan in 1979; if he realized that al-Afghani (mentioned earlier) was an Iranian; and if he understood that the CIA relied on the Gehlen Organization’s Nazis in Iran (which is the primary threat to Israel today) to overthrow Iran’s elected government in 1953. Loftus correctly notes that another threat to Israel is Hamas, which “is actually the secret chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood.” As I’ve indicated before, the PE’s plans involved coercing Israel into joining the recently formed Mediterranean Union which could then be linked economically to the European Union (EU). In order to do that, Yugoslavia’s Slobodan Milosovic was standing in the way and therefore had to be removed. Toward that end, CIA and Arab Nazis would once again join forces. The heart of the Nazi movement was, of course, in Germany, which plays a critical role in the success of the EU. PE agent and Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton became President in January 1993, and on January 13, Sen. Joe Biden (now President Obama’s Vice-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"President), asked Secretary of State of State nominee Warren Christopher how the new administration would “foster the creation of a new world order... converting NATO into a military instrument for peacekeeping under UN or CSCE auspices.” NATO would be headed militarily by Rhodes scholar Gen. Wesley Clark, and on April 3, 1995 the Clinton Administration appointed Retired Maj. Gen. John Sewall (Rhodes scholar) as a special military advisor to help integrate the armed forces of the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The various factions in Yugoslavia met in Dayton, Ohio and the Bosnian Peace Accords were signed November 1995 with Croatian leader Franjo Tudjman saying he believed the agreements would “result in lasting peace and create conditions necessary for the establishment of a new international order in this part of the world.” Explaining what happened, U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham on December 6, 1995 revealed: “Germany sees its economic future in the hands of the Balkans.” This was why EU leaders on June 27, 1995 had sent mediator Carl Bildt to Serbia (Yugoslavia) to demand the opening of a land corridor to the Adriatic (which leads to the Ionian Sea then to the Mediterranean). But Yugoslav leader Milosovic was still a problem, so the PE had to devise a means to remove him. The Arab Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Al Qaeda (Osama bin Laden) allied with Albanian Muslims to support the Muslim Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). According to former Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia James Bissett in “We Created a Monster” (Toronto Globe and Mail , July 31, 2001), long before the NATO bombing of Serbia (Yugoslavia) which began March 24, 1999 supposedly because of “ethnic cleansing” in Kosovo, “We now know that NATO countries were inciting violence in Kosovo and attempting to destabilize that Serbian province.... Media reports have revealed that as early as 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency, assisted by the British Special Armed Services, were arming and training Kosovo Liberation Army members in Albania to foment armed rebellion in Kosovo. The KLA terrorists were sent back into Kosovo to assassinate Serbian mayors, ambush Serbian policemen, and do everything possible to incite murder and chaos.... After bombing Yugoslavia into submission, NATO then stood by and submissively allowed the KLA to murder, pillage and burn....” On June 3, 1999 Milosovic accepted NATO’s demands to stop the bombing. This was after he was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia on May 24 for war crimes. On April 21, 2001 he was arrested and then extradited to The Hague in June. In February 2002 his trial started, and in January 2003 he pled not guilty. While the trial was still going on, he was found mysteriously dead in his cell in March 2006. Milosovic was no longer an obstacle to the PE’s plans to connect the EU to the future Mediterranean Union (MU) to be established formally January 27, 2010 (see http://europenews.dk/en/node/28957 ). In anticipation of the MU’s formal establishment, on January 21, 2010 the first meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Regional & Local Assembly (ARLEM) was called by PE agent Javier Solana, who had been simply a physics instructor in Virginia, but later made political head of NATO by Rhodes scholars Bill Clinton, Strobe Talbot and Richard Gardner."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Relevant to the Americas, by the early 1940s, German courts had declared Indians to be Aryans (Nelson Rockefeller’s Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs files: EAC 5200 Central Files, RG 229, Box 410, National Indian Institute Folder). And relevant to Latin America, Gerard Colby and Charlotte Dennett in Thy Will Be Done (1995) wrote that shortly after President Dwight Eisenhower was elected in November 1952, “Nazi scientists and Gestapo officers were being recruited by the U.S. Army Command in Germany for work against local communists; many of these men were then allowed to pass through the ‘rat pipeline’ with Vatican passports from Italy and Spain to Argentina.... At least a dozen of these Nazi fugitives remained CIA assets in countries like Bolivia and Chile.” In 1953, Allen Dulles was made CIA director under Eisenhower and was aware of the Nazis in Latin America. In March 1955, he briefed Nelson Rockefeller and other members of the National Security Council’s Operations Coordinating Board (OCB) on the CIA’s activities, including Operation Bloodstone. One German, Rafael von Steinbeck, who “had escaped from Poland via the Vatican ‘rat line’ run by a Croatian priest, Father Dragonovic,” went from Argentina to Panama, and then to Peru in 1963. Colby and Dennett report that “using the alias Jose Marie Still Georges, he became well known as Peru’s premier smuggler of oro blanco, the ‘white gold’ (cocaine).” The cocaine was smuggled from Leticia (on the border of Peru, Brazil and Colombia) northward “to Bogota [Colombia], points north, and Miami by airplane.” This is one example of CIA knowledge about cocaine smuggling into the U.S. By 1967, the Santa Cruz region in Bolivia east of the Andes had become the center of the cocaine trade. And according to Colby and Dennett, “One of the most powerful Germans in Bolivia at that time was a middle-aged merchant named Klaus Altmann. His real name was Klaus Barbie, the ‘Butcher of Lyons,’ who had escaped prosecution for mass murder in France through the assistance of the CIA, which used him as an ‘asset’ in the Cold War.... Barbie’s partner in ‘business’ affairs in Lima [Peru] was Friedrich Schwend, formerly Hitler’s official SS counterfeiter, and now the self-appointed minister of finance of Nazi funds smuggled out of Germany and used to finance the German exile network’s often illegal ventures, including drug running and cocaine trafficking.” The Nazi Barbie was still active 35 years after WWII as in July 17, 1980, “Barbie’s team hunted down and slaughtered [Bolivian] government officials and labor leaders, while Argentine specialists flew in to demonstrate the latest torture techniques,” according to Georg Hodel in “ Evita, the Swiss and the Nazis ” ( iF Magazine , January/February 1999,). Any fulfillment of the Nazi philosophy within the Power Elite’s (PE’s) larger plan would include its spiritual component, which involves Aryan occultism symbolized by the swastika (elitist symbol of power – link here ). Himmler was deeply into the occult, with occultic rituals performed at his castle. Also, at the end of WWII, 1000 Tibetan lamas’ corpses in Nazi uniforms were found in Berlin in 1945. PE agents John Ruskin (Cecil Rhodes’ mentor) and Rudyard Kipling used swastikas, as did Rhodes’ confidante William Stead’s friend Annie Besant, co-editor of Lucifer with Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Hitler learned of the swastika from Madame"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine , which he kept by his bed. Besant was succeeded by Alice Bailey whose works were first published by Lucifer Publishing, which changed its name to Lucis Trust and later managed the UN Meditation Room for many years. Robert Muller was UN Assistant Secretary-General for decades, including the time Nazi Kurt Waldheim was Secretary-General (1972-1982), and Muller’s mentor was UN Secretary-General U Thant who was a Buddhist monk. According to Andrew Young in The Politician (2010), Sen. John Edwards’ mistress, New Ager Rielle Hunter, believes she was here to serve Edwards and that their baby is “some kind of golden child,” who is “the reincarnated spirit of a Buddhist monk” who’s “going to help save the world.” Robert Muller’s schools around the world are based on the underlying philosophy of occultist Alice Bailey, who foretold that “The Plan,” imparted to her by “Ascended Masters,” included a one-world religion that would come into existence by 2025 A.D. This would complete the fulfillment of the secret Nazi plan within the PE’s control. That this was the objective all along can be seen in the following comment by Hitler (found in The Morning of the Magicians by Louis Pouwels and Jacques Bergier): “I had to encourage ‘national’ feelings for reasons of expediency; but I was already aware that the ‘nation’ idea could only have a temporary value. The day will come when even here in Germany what is known as ‘nationalism’ will practically have ceased to exist. What will take its place in the world will be a universal society of masters and overlords.” At this point, you probably have several questions about the secret Nazi plan and apparent historical contradictions. For example, if the PE agent Allen Dulles facilitated the plan via “Operation Paperclip” and “rat lines,” including the escape of Klaus Barbie and about 5000 other Nazis to Latin America (e.g., Argentina, Chile, Nicaragua and El Salvador) where Right-Wing government “death squads” soon appeared thereafter, then why did the PE also facilitate the Communist Revolution of 1917 in Russia and have its agent Harry Hopkins in WWII pass on nuclear material to the Soviet Union? Why did PE agent H. Rowan Gaither (president of the Ford Foundation) tell Congressional investigator Norman Dodd about the “comfortable merger” planned for the U.S. and U.S.S.R.? And why did the PE facilitate Communist Fidel Castro’s rise to power? The answer to this apparent contradiction can be found in PE agent Col. Edward M. House’s statement that if WWI had not come “in fierce and exaggerated form,” the League of Nations would not have been possible. Wars have been used by the PE to pressure nations through a dialectical process eventually to accept the World Socialist Government, which is the PE’s ultimate goal – thus the saying “perpetual war for perpetual peace.” This is why the PE would promote and fund both the Nazis and the Bolsheviks as well as Right-Wing Latin American dictators and their Communist revolutionary opponents. This is why Iran and its surrogates Hamas and Hezbollah are used to pressure Israel. And this is why Islamic jihadists have been used to threaten Russia, the U.S., and other nations. Pressure via conflict will be applied until a weary world will accept World Government as the only way to stop the violence. Remember Lincoln Bloomfield’s report to Rhodes Scholar and Secretary of State Dean Rusk in the early 1960s that declared “if the Communist dynamic was greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it has"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"for world government.” And the world government will be Socialist just as the Nazis were Socialist, the Soviet Union was Socialist, the nations of the European Union are Socialist, and the U.S. and China are becoming Socialist from the opposite extremes of Capitalism and Communism. So what should we look for in the near future concerning the PE’s plan? It has bothered me that a Nazi SS officer like Paul Dickopf would be allowed to become head of Interpol (and, no doubt, bring a lot of other Nazis with him). Therefore, Interpol is worth watching. Its formation in 1923 was overseen by Raymond Fosdick, an agent of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. interested in eugenics and “social control.” Earlier in this series, I mentioned the connection between Nazis and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company in the 1930s. During this time, Allen Dulles was an attorney for Standard Oil as well as I.G. Farben of Nazi Germany. Regarding Interpol, Gerald Posner and John Ware in Mengele (1986) explained: “Its [Interpol’s] hierarchy also has an unhealthy history of close connections with National Socialism. In 1939, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Gestapo, was voted president of Interpol. In December 1941, Interpol moved its headquarters to the fashionable Berlin suburb of Wannsee, where it shared a villa with the Gestapo. Heydrich even made Interpol a division within the SD, the Security Police. When Heydrich was assassinated in June 1942, Himmler chose Heydrich’s successor at the Gestapo, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, to replace him as Interpol’s president” from 1943 to1945. At the end of WWII, Allen Dulles co-authored a booklet, The United Nations (1946), in which he wrote that “a long time will be needed before world government is politically feasible.... This time element might seemingly be shortened so far as American opinion is concerned by an active propaganda campaign in this country....” In 1946, Dulles also became president of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and in 1950 David Rockefeller became the CFR’s vice-president. Rockefeller held that position for 20 years till 1970, when he became the CFR’s chairman for 15 years until 1985. Dulles died in 1969, and earlier in this series I suggested he was probably the one who approved the Nazi Dickopf becoming head of Interpol in 1968. President after president in the U.S. did not grant Interpol immunities in this nation. However, on December 17, 2009, President Obama issued “Executive Order—Amending Executive Order 12425” (of June 16, 1983), thereby “designating Interpol as a public international organization entitled to enjoy certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities.” This was after The New York Times published an article by Doreen Carvajal on October 11, 2009, and datelined Paris that began as follows: “Interpol and the United Nations are poised to become partners in fighting crime by jointly grooming a global police force....” Who pushed for immunities for Interpol? I’m guessing it’s the controversial Obama Attorney-General Eric Holder, who believes we have no Second Amendment rights as individuals (see ABC’s “This Week” for May 2, 1999) and who wants to read terrorists their “Miranda Rights.” Holder is a close friend of Ron Noble (head of Interpol) from when they were both Clintonistas. It was Noble as U.S. Treasury Department’s"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Undersecretary for Enforcement who investigated the failed February 28, 1993 BATF raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. And it was then Deputy- Attorney-General Eric Holder to whom Sen. Danforth’s investigation of the FBI raid on the compound reported. After this, Clinton Attorney-General Janet Reno in 1998 nominated Noble to be Secretary-General of Interpol, and he occupied that position on July 2, 1999. He’s been there eleven years now, and with President Obama’s Executive Order of December 17, Interpol now has certain “immunities” in the U.S. Think about the possible consequences of this and how they could further the PE’s goals. It is important for the reader to remember at this point that the Nazis were/are only a subpart of the larger PE plan. Therefore, it is important to remember that in Sumner Welles’ expose in The Time for Decision (1944), it was the German General Staff (GGS) which had already dispersed its agents to two successive countries to carry out its plan in perhaps two generations. Thus, it is useful here to explain what Welles determined. He explained that whether the “ostensible ruler” is the Kaiser or Hitler, and whether the nation suffered defeat after defeat, “the German General Staff will continue making its plans for the future.” Welles related that the German people as a whole believed their “Army will survive to become the agency through which the master race will ultimately triumph.” He continued: “The German General Staff is already well-aware of Germany’s inevitable defeat.... It has, however, made detailed plans for a later renewal of its attempt to dominate the world. Measures have already been taken throughout the globe to facilitate the execution of these plans when the favorable moment arrives.... The General Staff itself is only one-half visible. Half the mechanism is secret and will so remain.” Welles revealed the GGS “have perfected the theory of ‘indirect complicity’... [through which it] plans to complete its domination of the world. The theory of ‘indirect complicity’... will prove so incomprehensible to the Anglo-Saxon mind in its entirety that the idea will not be fully grasped.” GGS agents via “indirect accomplices, preferably nationals of the country over whom a sure measure of control can be exercised,” would be able to possess key industries. The GGS would be able to carry out its plan initially because a majority of its agents “are being trained to appear as men of large commercial or financial interests, who will be able to dispose of considerable amounts of capital derived from the reserves which the German General Staff has already, during the past years, deposited under one guise or another in neutral countries.... Each agent will be able to cultivate a circle of indirect and unknowing accomplices, nationals of the country where he is stationed, who can determine opinion, control industrial production, and even influence the results of elections.” At this point, you may be asking who executed the secret Nazi plan, the GGS and its agents or Himmler and his SS agents? In my opinion they worked together toward its fulfillment, and the process has now been going on for about two generations. Perhaps this is why, as I mentioned in Part 9 of this series, the British placed a 100-year ban on seeing documents about Himmler’s supposed “suicide” by cyanide. It doesn’t take 100"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"years for the leaders of WWII to pass away in case a ban is desired to protect reputations. However, it would take about 100 years if the goal is to keep people ignorant about the PE’s plan for a world government. Remember, H.G. Wells’ book The New World Order about the planned world government was published in 1939. As I’ve mentioned before, “the Phoenix” as the world currency is planned for 2018, and Alice Bailey in 1933 said the outer structure of the World Federation of Nations will be “taking rapid shape by 2025.” Could the manipulation of public opinion, problems with industrial production, and election results today be the outcome of the secret Nazi plan? And that plan is a subpart of the PE’s plan for a World Socialist Government ruled by themselves, an elite whom they consider a “master race.” Remember that David Rockefeller once told Congressman William Dannemayer that “some men are born to rule, but most men are born to be ruled.” It’s like Robert Mitchum said in the 1981 movie Agency : “Someone must use a guiding hand. I’ve been hired, financed,... the names don’t matter, though you might recognize some of them. Let’s just call them an elite of power, or maybe an influential elite who understand the value of manipulating public opinion.... The public wants to be led. It needs to be led. We have long term plans.... The concentration of power is healthy. It’s like vacuum cleaner that sucks up all the chaos and disorder and gets rid of it.” [Note: On ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” (March 29), one of the songs played was “Fly Me to the Moon” written by Bart Howard in 1954. The lyrics to the song say, “You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.” Ask Adam what happened to him when he chose the will of Eve rather than the will of God, Whom Adam should have worshipped and adored exclusively.] In Charles Higham’s Trading With the Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1949 , one learns that “in 1936 the J. Henry Schroder Bank of New York had entered into a partnership with the Rockefellers. Schroder, Rockefeller and Company, Investment Bankers, was formed as part of an overall company that TIME magazine disclosed as being ‘the economic booster of the Rome-Berlin Axis.’ The partners in Schroder, Rockefeller and Company included Avery Rockefeller, nephew of John D., Baron Bruno von Schroder in London, and Kurt von Schroder of the BIS (Bank for International Settlements) and Gestapo in Cologne.... Their lawyers were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles of Sullivan and Cromwell.... The Rockefellers owned Standard Oil of New Jersey, the German accounts of which were siphoned through their own bank (the Chase) as well as through the independent National City Bank of New York.... Two executives of Standard Oil’s German subsidiary were Karl Lindemann and Emil Helfferich, prominent figures in Himmler’s Circle of Friends of the Gestapo—its chief financiers—and close friends and colleagues of the BIS’s Baron von Schroder.” According to “The Hunt Hits Home” by Michael Hirsh in Newsweek (December 14, 1998), in 1940 John Foster Dulles working for Sullivan and Cromwell oversaw the drafting of papers “creating a Swedish dummy owner” for Nazi engine parts producer “Bosch’s U.S. arm so that the Nazis could retain control,... and according to Marc"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Masurovsky, a former Justice Department historian, recently declassified documents show that at least 300 companies continued doing business in Germany during the war.” To understand why the Dulles brothers would help the Nazis, one must again be reminded that the Nazis were/are simply one subpart of the larger Power Elite (PE) plan for total control via a world government. PE member Cecil Rhodes’ secret Society of the Elect’s “scheme to take the government of the whole world,” in Rhodes’ own words, was executed by Lord Alfred Milner, whose group virtually ran British foreign affairs before WWII. Milner was anti-Zionist, and the head of British intelligence for the Transjordan was anti-Zionist Jack Philby, who in 1923 created the Arab Legion and afterward became advisor to the House of Saud. Ibn Saud was the leader of the Wahhabi Sect of Muslims from which Al Qaeda would arise. Harry St. John Bridger Philby (known as Jack) is an example of a PE agent at the nexus of Cecil Rhodes’ secret plan and its dialectical process, the pan-Islamic crescent, and the Nazis. Jack Philby’s Arabic name was Sheikh Abdullah. He had been a classmate of Jawaharlal Nehru, who would later be Prime Minister of India. In his autobiography, he referred to himself as “the first Socialist to join the Indian Civil Service” in 1907. In 1908, his work took him to Lahore, which later in the 20th century would become a terrorist training ground in Pakistan. In 1915, PE agent British High Commissioner Percy Cox (who would in late November 1922 create the Iraq-Kuwait border to keep Iraq from having access to the sea and therefore remain dependent on Britain) appointed Philby to a finance post in Baghdad. As usual, these two PE agents had a mission of subterfuge. In addition to protecting the oilfields near Basra, they organized the Arab revolts against the Ottoman Turks. Remember in the recent Iraq war how two British agent provocateurs dressed as Arabs engaged in terrorist attacks in Basra? Relevant to the dialectical process, while Jack Philby was allied with the Nazis, his son Kim Philby was a British intelligence officer who became a double agent for the Soviets. By 1940, Jack Philby had allied with the anti-Zionist Dulles brothers in making deals between the Nazis and the Saudis. However, in typical dialectical fashion, like PE agent John J. McCloy, Jack Philby early in 1939 had developed a plan for Jewish immigration to Palestine, and after WWII there was talk among those around King Ibn Saud that Philby was still working for the British Secret Service and was perhaps a Zionist spy. Prior to WWII, Graeme Howard was General Motors’ representative in Germany, and after the war he was in charge of personnel for the Control Council under the Deputy Military Governor of Germany, Lt. Gen. Lucius Clay, who was lenient on Nazi war criminals and halted all war crimes trials by the end of 1947. In 1940, Graeme Howard’s America and the New World Order was published, and in it he wrote about “the formation of regional economic entities.... Cooperative regionalism [will] bring about a better world order through internationally balanced economic and political regional blocs.” Similarly, Rhodes’ Association of Helpers member, Canadian P.E. Corbett, in 1942 authored Post-War Worlds declaring: “It must be recognized that the law of nations takes precedence over national law.... A world association binding together and coordinating regional groupings of states (nations) may evolve toward one universal"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"federal government.... World government is the ultimate aim, but there is more chance of attaining it by gradual development.” Two years later (1944), Corbett would become chairman of the political science department at Yale University, and would have likely come in contact there with members of Skull & Bones such as George H.W. Bush. The themes of Howard’s and Corbett’s books would be echoed by Rhodes scholar Richard Gardner in the Council on Foreign Relations’ Foreign Affairs (April 1974) and by PE agent Zbigniew Brzezinski at Mikahil Gorbachev’s first State of the World Forum (1995). The year after Howard’s book was published, on June 26, 1941 Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes declared: “If America loses the war it can thank the Aluminum Corporation of America.” According to George Seldes in Facts and Facism , this was because Alcoa had signed a cartel agreement with the Nazi-controlled I.G. Farben, and this “sabotaged the aluminum program of the U.S. Air Force.” In addition to major U.S. corporations helping the Nazis, American bankers also played a critical role. In Charles Higham’s Trading with the Enemy , he reveals that Joseph Larkin, who was in charge of Rockefeller’s Chase National Bank’s (CNB’s) European affairs, allowed Nazi collaborator Carlos Niedermann to head CNB’s Paris branch throughout the war, and that Larkin knew of the Nazis’ plan to use its CNB investments after the war to effect their policies in the U.S. Internationally important for the Nazis was its control over the BIS. The BIS was established in 1930 and its first president was Gates McGarrah of CNB. During the 1930s, the BIS helped fund the Nazis, and at the time of Pearl Harbor the BIS president was Thomas McKittrick, an associate of the J.P. Morgan bankers. According to Charles Higham in American Swastika , the Reichsbank and Nazi and Italian governments still (February 1942) approved of McKittrick, stating “McKittrick’s opinions are safely known by us.” After the war, McKittrick became vice-president of CNB. The year after the Nazis approved of American Thomas McKittrick being head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), on January 25, 1943 Hearst newspapers reporter Burnet Hershey described the Nazis’ escape route via Spain as follows: “Every talk I had with the Germans in Lisbon made that fact clear. They may be defeated on the battlefield, as they were in 1918, but they expect to win again at the peace table as they did in 1919. Of course, they will sacrifice Hitler as they sacrificed the Kaiser; but the old gang—the generals, big industrialists, phony professors of mis-education about German race superiority—will try to go underground again to lay the eggs for another war of German conquest.” There are two very important points about this quote. First, it shows that over 2-1/2 years before they lost WWII, the Nazis were going underground. And secondly, Hitler was unimportant in this whole effort. Who was important in the secret Nazi plan? It was Heinrich Himmler! About two years after Hershey’s report, on January 15, 1945 Newsweek reported: “Many of the men Himmler sent to Spain and Argentina, to carry out Nazi plans for postwar survival,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"carried passports under false names and later were reported dead in Germany. All have had training in Nazi political methods and experience abroad in commercial and other posts.” In T.H. Tetens’ Germany Plots With the Kremlin (1953), one finds that seven months after Hearst reporter Hershey’s description of the Nazis’ escape routes, on July 27, 1943 the German Foreign Office expert on the U.S., Dr. Colin Ross, wrote “Plan For An Ideological Campaign in the United States,” describing the need for all-out psychological warfare carried out by an underground organization in the U.S. (and in every country under “enemy” occupation). Also important in the secret Nazi plan was Martin Bormann. Beginning in 1943 until June 1944, he transferred large amounts of gold across France to Spain and then on to Argentina, where his deposits were safe under the sympathetic Peron government. CBS World War II journalist Paul Manning in Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile (1981) related that Bormann’s organization controlled Germany’s big business, and via its investments controlled much of the rest of the world’s economy. It was the repository for the stolen wealth of Europe, estimated by British intelligence to have been more than $180 billion by the end of 1943. Then, relating information he found in the FBI’s file on Bormann, Manning wrote: “...the file revealed that he had been banking under his own name from his office in Germany in Deutsche Bank of Buenos Aires since 1941; that he held one joint account with Argentinian dictator Juan Peron; and on August 4, 5 and 14, 1967, he had written checks on demand accounts in first National City Bank (Overseas Division) of New York, The Chase Manhattan Bank, and Manufacturer’s Hanover Trust Co., all cleared through Deutsche Bank of Buenos Aires....” Following what Sumner Welles revealed about the secret Nazi plan reaching fulfillment “in perhaps two generations,” Manning explained: “Bormann today may be likened to the classic chairman of the board of a vast international business complex, of an organization holding greater assets than any private investment house on Wall Street. Bormann, aged though he is (he was 80 on June 17, 1980), continues to guide the destiny of his financial empire. But he is sufficiently prudent and farsighted to realize that the assets he controls must be placed in younger hands, and today the leadership council of the senior NSDAP [National Socialist German Workers’ Party, Nazi Party] group is reflected in a younger generation, comprising professional managers, lawyers, and financiers, who are calling the shots as money and the trade are moved among the markets of the Americas and Europe. Their organization holds the bearer bonds that give him a voice in banks and industries of Germany, and likewise they hold blue chip stocks in U.S. heavy industries and chemical companies. They are represented too on the boards of corporations in France, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, as well as in a myriad of other countries, including those in their bastion, Latin America.” Relevant to how the Power Elite (PE) uses the secret Nazi plan to bring Israel under its control via economic coercion, Manning wrote: “It has drawn many of the brightest Jewish businessmen into a participatory role in the development of many of its corporations, and many of these Jews share their prosperity most generously with Israel.... This has taken place in many other instances across America and demonstrates how Bormann’s people operate in the contemporary commercial world, in contrast to"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the fanciful nonsense with which Nazis are described in so much ‘literature.’ So much emphasis is placed on select Jewish participation in Bormann companies that when Adolf Eichmann was seized and taken to Tel Aviv to stand trial, it produced a shock wave in the Jewish and German communities of Buenos Aires. Jewish leaders informed the Israeli authorities in no uncertain terms that this must never happen again because a repetition would permanently rupture relations with the Germans of Latin America, as well as with the Bormann organization, and cut off the flow of Jewish money to Israel. It never happened again, and the pursuit of Bormann quieted down at the request of Jewish leaders. He is residing in an Argentine safe haven, protected by the most efficient German infrastructure in history as well as by all those whose prosperity depends on his well-being.” In a related story, John Buchanan and Stacey Michael in “Bush/Nazi Link Continued” ( The New Hampshire Gazette , November 7, 2003) revealed that “after the seizures in late 1942 of five U.S. enterprises he managed on behalf of Nazi industrialist Fritz Thyssen, Prescott Bush, the grandfather of President George W. Bush, failed to divest himself of more than a dozen ‘enemy nation’ relationships that continued until as late as 1951, newly-discovered U.S. government documents reveal.... The records also show that Bush and the Harrimans conducted business after the War with related concerns doing business in or moving assets into Switzerland, Panama, Argentina and Brazil—all critical outposts for the flight of Nazi capital after Germany’s surrender in 1945.” In 1944, Nazi Gen. Karl-Heinrich von Stuepnagel in the French newspaper Combat, was very clear about the Nazis’ perspective, stating: “Our defeat in the present war need not be considered except as an incident in the triumphal march of Germany towards the conquest of the world.... What does a temporary defeat matter if, through the destruction of people and material wealth in enemy countries, we are able to secure a margin of economic and demographic superiority even greater than before 1939?... We shall have to organize a campaign of pity designed to induce [our enemies] to send us needed supplies at the earliest possible moment. Above all we must hold on to the assets we have deposited in neutral countries. The present war will thus have been victorious, in spite of our temporary military defeat, because it will have been a march forward towards our supremacy.” On March 30, 1945 the U.S. State Department indicated that in 1944, German patent registrations in foreign countries reached an all-time high. This was part of the secret Nazi plan for control after WWII. By the end of the year, in November 1944 the U.S. Senate Military Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on War Mobilization issued a report on Cartels and National Security that indicated the Nazis “are already deploying their economic reserves throughout the world in preparation for a third attempt at world domination,” according to Sen. Harley Kilgore. Martin Bormann’s success in spreading the Nazis’ assets around the world was heralded at the Nuremberg Trials by Hermann Schmitz, head of I.G. Farben and a director of the BIS. Farben’s N.W.7 division was, of course, close to Himmler’s SS and the Gestapo, and in Paul Manning’s Martin Bormann: Nazi In Exile , one reads that Schmitz at Nuremberg testified: “We can continue. We have an operational plan. However, I don’t"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"believe our board members will be detained long. Nor will I. But we must go through a procedure of investigation before release, so I have been told by our N.W.7 people who have excellent contacts in Washington.” Incidentally, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who formed the Bilderberg Group in 1954 was a Nazi SS officer who also worked for N.W.7. Before in this series, I’ve mentioned the Nazis’ Gehlen Organization (GO) and Nazi Otto Skorzeny’s ODESSA network and how they worked together after WWII. In Martin Lee’s The Beast Reawakens (2000), one learns that former U.S. intelligence officer William Corson revealed: “Gehlen’s Organization was designed to protect the ODESSA Nazis. It amounts to an exceptionally well-orchestrated diversion,” so that the Nazis could continue their plan for world domination. Relevant to this, Martin Lee in The Beast Reawakens (2000) revealed that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Otto Skorzeny struck up a relationship that lasted many years. “Arafat would have done anything for Otto!” remarked Ilse Skorzeny (Otto’s widow). I have also previously mentioned Operation Bloodstone, which brought Nazis to the U.S. and was originally approved on June 10, 1948 by the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC). One of the original sponsors of Operation Bloodstone was Robert Lovett of the War Department, who was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the secret Skull & Bones Society. According to Christopher Simpson in Blowback (1988), one month after Operation Bloodstone was approved, it was expanded to include covert operations including sabotage and assassinations. John D. Rockefeller III was a senior Navy staff member of SWNCC, which approved of Operation Bloodstone. As member of the Power Elite (PE), he also founded the Population Council in 1953 and later (1973) wrote The Second American Revolution , applauding sexual liberation and the “humanistic revolution” while disparaging “old- fashioned nationalism.” The president at the time Operation Bloodstone was approved and executed was Harry Truman, whom most believe to have been a patriotic nationalist. However, he carried in his pocket that part of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall” (1842) which called for “the parliament of man in the Federation of the world,” and he explained “that’s what I have been working for.” On June 28, 1945 Truman stated: “It will be just as easy for nations to get along in a republic of the world as it is for us to get along in the republic of the United States.” Truman was an agent of the PE, nominated for the position of Vice-President under F.D.R. in 1944 by Oscar Ewing and others. Ewing was Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and also a lawyer for Standard Oil, CBS, Fox Films, and others. Among the others was Alcoa, for which Ewing facilitated agreements with the Nazis. In George Seldes’ Facts and Fascism , he reveals that “some of our biggest monopolies entered into secret agreements with the Nazis’ cartels and divided the world up among them. Most notorious of all was Alcoa, the Mellon-Davis-Duke monopoly which is largely responsible for the fact America did not have the aluminum with which to build airplanes before and after Pearl Harbor, while Germany had an unlimited supply.”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Today, the federal government is taking control over more and more (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, General Motors, etc.). To the extent it has complete control over business entities, we are moving toward National Socialism. To the extent the federal government’s control is exercised via rules and regulations, it is Fascism. This is part of the PE’s secret Nazi plan beginning in the 1930s. From Ambassador Dodd’s Diary (1941), George Seldes in Facts and Fascism quotes U.S. Ambassador to Germany William E. Dodd in 1937 as saying: “A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime.... Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy. They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are helping to keep it there.” Money was at the heart of the Nazis’ secret plan for eventual world domination after WWII. Relevant to this, historian Marc Masurovsky testified on June 25, 1997 to the U.S. House Banking Committee that in late 1946 the Allied commissions searching for art the Nazis had looted were unfortunately closed down, and that from August 1944 to July 1946 perhaps thousands of these looted items “found there way out of Europe and into North and South American collections.” He also asked: “Why did the State Department agree to downplay the verifiable amount of looted gold in Switzerland as a means of obtaining ratification of the Washington Accord?” In answer to the above, remember the role of the Dulles brothers concerning the State Department and vis a vis the Nazis. Allen Dulles had also negotiated deals between the Nazis and the Saudis, and while President Franklin Roosevelt may have not have been allied with all of Dulles’ actions, one should remember what FDR wrote to the Saudi King on April 5, 1945. Relevant to the question of the Jews in Palestine, he wrote: “Your Majesty will also doubtless recall that during our recent conversation I assured you that I would take no action in my capacity as Chief of the Executive Branch of this Government which might prove hostile to the Arab people.” Not long after this letter, FDR was succeeded as president by Harry Truman, who approved of various operations that brought Nazis to the U.S. In Part 12 of this series, I quoted FDR’s Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes saying Alcoa would be to blame if the U.S. lost WWII. In 1944, Alcoa hired Oscar Ewing as its attorney for $750,000 per year. In that same year, Ewing was an official with the Democratic National Committee that promoted Truman for vice-president. And in 1947, President Truman appointed Ewing as administrator of the Federal Security Agency that included Public Health Service. Ewing immediately initiated a program to put fluoride in Americans’ drinking water, and he hired Edward Bernays to develop a propaganda campaign toward that end. In 1928 in Propaganda , Bernays had written that “those who manipulate the organized habits and opinions of the masses constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of the country.... The technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented.”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"In Alcoa’s aluminum refining process, fluorine/fluoride is produced, and Ewing had helped facilitate fluoride agreements with the Nazis. According to an October 2, 1954 letter from researcher Charles Eliot Perkins to the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, “In the 1930s Hitler and the German Nazis envisioned a world to be dominated and controlled by the Nazis' philosophy.... The German chemists worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass control which was submitted to and adopted by the German General Staff. This plan was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water supplies. By this method they could control the population of whole areas, reduce population by water medication that would produce sterility in the women, and so on. In this scheme of mass control, sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place.... The real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty.... There is a small area of the brain tissue that is responsible for the individual’s power to resist domination. Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluorine will in time gradually reduce the individual’s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing this area of the brain tissue and make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him....” Remember that the secret Nazi plan was developed by the German General Staff. DuPont was also helpful to the Nazis. Irenee du Pont greatly admired Hitler and in a September 7, 1926 speech to the American Chemical Society, he advocated the injection of special drugs to create a race of supermen. General Motors (GM) was under the control of the DuPont family, and according to Charles Higham in Tradiing With the Enemy , by “the mid-1930s General Motors was committed to full-scale production of trucks, armored cars, and tanks in Nazi Germany.” Higham also revealed that “on November 23, 1937 representatives of General Motors held a secret meeting in Boston with Baron Manfred von Killinger, who was... in charge of West Coast espionage [for the Nazis], and Baron von Tipplekirsch, Nazi Consul General and Gestapo leader in Boston. This group signed a joint agreement showing total commitment to the Nazi cause for the indefinite future.” Not only was GM working with the Nazis, but Henry Ford also greatly admired Hitler. Higham explained that as late as 1940, Ford Motor Company “refused to build aircraft engines for England and instead built supplies of the 5-ton military trucks that were the backbone of German army transportation.” There was considerable Fascist sentiment in the U.S. in the 1930s, and Marine General Smedley Butler was actually approached to lead an effort to overthrow FDR and establish a Fascist government. Butler reported this to the appropriate federal authorities, and his account can be verified by the report of the Congressional Special Committee on Un-American Acitivities investigation of Nazi and other propaganda which acknowledged that “certain persons made an attempt to establish a Facsist organization in the country.... The committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler.” Among Oscar Ewing’s other clients were CBS (for which Edward Bernays worked) and Rockefeller’s Standard Oil which helped the Nazis. The Rockefeller Foundation funded"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Nazi Dr. Ernst Rudin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Brain Institute, and Rudin taught Dr. Josef Mengele. Mengele was known as the “angel of death,” and the horrible things Nazi doctors like Mengele did were exposed in Robert Jay Lifton’s The Nazi Doctors (1986). Lifton wrote: “Dr. Hermann Pfannmuller developed a policy of starving designated children to death... [by] gradual decrease of the rations.” In case you think this type of mentality is not here today, remember that in 1986 the American Medical Association added “nourishment and hydration” to its list of “artificial” medical treatments which could be withheld from patients. More recently, President Barack Obama’s regulatory czar Cass Sunstein in 2008 co-authored Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness , wherein he referred to the possibility of “routine removal” of body parts because the state “owns the right to body parts of people who are... in certain hopeless conditions, and [the state] can remove their organs without asking anyone’s permission.\" From where did this attitude come? Francis Galton (half cousin of Charles Darwin) is known as the founder of the eugenics movement in the late 1800s. The Rockefellers saw eugenics as one means of developing the “social control” they desired. Concerning the Rockefellers, eugenics and the Nazis, in When Medicine Went Mad: Bioethics and the Holocaust (1992) edited by Arthur Caplan, one reads that “the German Mental Hygiene Movement was heavily subsidized by the Rockefeller Foundation and thereby put into a healthy position to continue its aims and objectives to the bitter end. Further it was Dr. Alexis Carrel of the Rockefeller Institute [for Medical Research in the U.S.] and a Nobel Prize winner, who so loudly applauded the actions of the Germans and blatantly advocated mass murder of mental patients and prisoners.” In Man, the Unknown (1935), Carrel wrote: “Why should society not dispose of the criminals and the insane in a more economical manner?... Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane guilty of criminal acts.” Also greatly supporting the eugenics movement was the Carnegie Institution, which funded the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory that conducted eugenic research experiments. The Institution was headed by Skull & Bones member Daniel Coit Gilman, who was succeeded by John Campbell Merriam, whose brother was Charles Merriam. This latter Merriam from 1923 to 1940 was chairman of the political science department at the University of Chicago, which was a Rockefeller-created and funded institution. In 1931 he wrote New Aspects of Politics , in which he indicated “control is likely in the future... to breed whatever type of human being is desired to have... strange beasts of burden....” And in The Role of Politics in Social Change (1936), he related how “management” of people would be part of “the strategy of control.” Today, people are about to be “managed” via such things as President Obama’s June 10, 2010 Executive Order “Establishing the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Council,” which “contains a list of national priorities on health promotion and disease prevention to address lifestyle behavior modification including... mental health, behavioral health....” [Note: Regarding the question of whether the founding fathers established the U.S. as a Christian nation, they also accepted the principle of religious freedom whereby there were no legal penalties against deists like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. The problem today is that identifiably Biblical values have been legally banned from the public arena (the Ten Commandments have been outlawed on public property but pagan deities are not). While Bible reading and prayer are legally prohibited from public schools, the religion of secular Humanism (based upon the principle that ethics are autonomous and situational) is preached in those same schools every day. The founding fathers never intended that. Recently, I had a 4-part series on NewsWithViews.com concerning the real meaning of the Statue of Liberty (SL). No doubt, on the upcoming History Channel program about this, American Freemasons will assert that the SL is simply a gift from the people of France symbolizing freedom. However, as I indicated, the SL’s designer, Auguste Bartholdi. originally planned the Statue to be the Egyptian goddess Isis and located at the Suez Canal. Bartholdi was initiated into the Grand Orient Freemasons of France on October 14, 1875. The Grand Orient was involved in the conceptualization of the SL, including the seven pointed rays of light emanating from the Statue’s head (exactly like an ancient engraving of the Assyrian/Babylonian equivalent of Isis named Semiramis) and the Masonic keystone in her left hand. Freemason Henri Martin encouraged the project, and Bartholdi even convened his lodge on June 19, 1884 to review the SL before it was shown to the U.S. committee. The founding fathers of America were well-versed in the classics, and the phrase “Annuit Coeptis” above the pyramid on the dollar bill (originally on the National Seal adopted June 20, 1782) is adapted from Aeneid (by Virgil), which says “Jupiter favour us in our undertaking.” “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” also on the National Seal and dollar bill is adapted from Virgil’s Eclogues . David Ovason has described the astrological orientation of Washington, D.C. involving Jupiter and the constellation Virgo (which is associated with the goddess Isis). For example, he shows that Washington is laid out so that every August 3 the sun shines down Pennsylvania Avenue striking the pyramidion on the top of the Post Office tower.] In Part 14 of this series, I related that Charles Merriam in The Role of Politics in Social Change (1936) explained how “management” of people would be part of “the strategy of control.” The Power Elite (PE) have “managed” and “controlled” world events through the dialectical process first to support the creation of the Soviet Union, and then the economic collapse (1929-1933) of Germany’s Weimar Republic which gave rise to Hitler and the Nazis as the countervailing antithesis to the Soviets. Concerning the Soviets, PE agent Col. Edward M. House entered into his diary in January 1919 how he lied to world leaders about the impossibility of intervening militarily against the Soviets when he actually believed it would have been successful."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Think of all the horrible things done under Communism since that time, and understand that they did not have to occur! But the PE wanted Communist regimes to exist as part of their dialectical process. In fact, beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intelligence had a file titled “Synarchist International: Nazi/Communist,” including Dr. Herman Erben who joined the Nazi Party in Austria in 1926, became active as a Nazi spy in the U.S., Mexico, China, etc., and then also started working with the Soviets in the 1930s. During WWII he worked for the Nazi Gestapo and Soviet agent Richard Sorge. And in 1950, he was in Iran where the Nazi Gehlen Organization would help Allen Dulles overthrow the Mossadegh government in 1953. There Erben converted from Judaism to Islam. To see how the PE was in control of the Nazi movement, it is useful to look at Nazis both useful and not useful to the PE. For example, Davud Monshizadeh was an Iranian who moved to Germany in 1937 and by 1939 was working for the Persian program of Nazi Germany’s Deutsche Radio. The next year, he began writing articles with the Nazi Party’s Das Reich . He became a member of the SS and helped protect the Fuehrer’s bunker at the battle of Berlin ( he even tried to look like Hitler ). In 1952, Monshizadeh was a co-founder of the Nazi Party in Iran called SUMKA. Beginning in 1948 via an operation code-named “Bedman,” the U.S. indirectly funded Nazi supporters who were Iranian nationalists as a means of countering Soviet influence in Iran. However, when they and Monshizadeh’s SUMKA supported Iranian leader Mohammad Mossadegh’s oil nationalization, the globalists PE wouldn’t tolerate that. Instead, Nazis like those in the Gehlen Organization (GO) were acceptable to the PE because they helped PE agents like CIA director Allen Dulles in “Operation Ajax” overthrow the nationalist Mossadegh government in 1953, installing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in his place. Pahlavi reversed oil nationalization and “unofficially exiled” Monshizadeh to Europe in 1953. What the PE giveth, though, the PE can taketh away. So PE agent Zbigniew Brzezinski (ZB) as President Carter’s National Security Advisor implemented a Pan-Islamic crescent strategy in the late 1970s to serve as a buffer to Soviet southern expansion. This meant the Fascist (according to author David Pryce-Jones) Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini replaced the Shah, who departed Iran on January 17, 1979. Khomeini being a Fascist would have fit well within the secret Nazi plan. Remember also that a key component of this plan was to finance foreign nationals (e.g., Iranians in Iran) as front men to control key industries in those countries. In Iran, this may have been done with assistance by the GO. During Khomeini’s takeover of Iran, Robert Gates (President Obama’s Secretary of Defense) participated in a meeting with the ZB and related how ZB “outlined the U.S. stance regarding the ouster of the Shah and Khomeini’s new Islamic Revolution very succinctly: Acceptance of the Revolution; recognition of Khomeini’s government; supplies of arms contracted by the Shah delivered to Khomeini; and a future working relationship.” According to Mike Evans in Jimmy Carter: The Liberal Left and World Chaos , a former naval intelligence officer and CIA operative informed him “that the U.S. government wrote checks to Khomeini in increments of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"approximately $150 million.” The PE/Nazi front men mentioned earlier may have helped to facilitate Khomeini’s Revolution and the Mullahs’ rule today. However, because this is part of a larger PE plan for world government, there will probably be an economic or military crisis in the not too distant future, caused by the PE which would coerce the Mullahs into becoming less belligerent and sharing power with the former Shah’s son, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi who has lived in the U.S. since 1984. For additional information relevant to Iran, see my 5-part series on NewsWithViews.com titled “What is the Role of Iran?” Therein you will see many examples of Iran being behind terrorist attacks against the U.S. The fact that we did not respond to these by retaliating against Iran shows that our national leaders really are not in control of this country, but rather it is the PE who is in control. Remember also that there is an occult element to the PE’s plans. I mentioned earlier in this series how Hitler had studied the occultist Madame Blavatsky who, with her close friend Albert Pike, emphasized Gnostic principles. In Pike’s Morals and Dogma (1871), he described “the fundamental teachings of Gnosticism,” beginning with “emanation from the Deity of all spiritual beings, progressive degeneration of these beings from emanation to emanation, redemption and return of all to the purity of the Creator; and, ... the re-establishment of the primitive harmony of all.” Gnosis referred to the secret knowledge obtained via the ancient mystery traditions whereby one could understand the spiritual forces behind things. While the Gnostics didn’t believe Jesus Christ was God or the Son of God, they did believe Christ had tapped into this Gnosis. Hitler learned of this concept as a child in 1899 at Lambach Abbey School headed by a Benedictine monk Theodore Hagen who was familiar with Gnosticism and had an affinity for Sufism (Thanksgiving Square in Dallas contains a chapel with a spiral ceiling designed by Benedictine Brother David Steindl-Rast who networks with the Islamic Sufis). At the abbey (which had various swastikas) was a Cistercian monk, Adolf Joseph Lanz, who mentored Hitler and founded the Order of the New Temple (like the Knights Templar). Lanz promoted Aryanism (as had Blavatsky and Pike) as did the Gnostic Thule Society, which used Hitler as a spokesman. As part of the Nazi plan for the future, Christianity in the sense of salvation through Jesus Christ as the Son of God would be replaced by the Gnostic belief in salvation via obtaining Gnosis as described above. Just as Hitler was an occultist, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was an admirer of Nicholas Roerich (of the Great White Brotherhood) and Lord Maitreya (allegedly the “returned Christ” of today). And do you really believe it was simply coincidental that David Rockefeller was standing outside the University of Wisconsin cafeteria where he asked Wayne Peterson to be in the Peace Corps? When Peterson returned from the Peace Corps in Brazil do you really believe in his parents’ living room just happened to be Mel Laird (Nixon’s Secretary of Defense) offering to get Peterson in the federal government? And from his position administering the Fulbright Scholarship Program, do you really believe Peterson then just happened to start traveling around the country (e.g., on the Merv Griffin TV show) promoting Lord Maitreya?"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Relevant to this, remember the “spiritual” aspect of the planned “new world order” is the first one listed in the following quote from the 1959 panel report of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Special Studies Project titled The Mid-Century Challenge to U.S. Foreign Policy: “We should not escape, and indeed should welcome, the task which history has imposed on us. This is the task of helping to shape a new world order in all its dimensions—spiritual, economic, political, social.” [Note: In 2003, I wrote a book called Cover-Up: Government Spin or Truth? regarding 9/11 and the war with Iraq. A new book, The Reluctant Spy by John Kiriakau, confirms that our government has covered-up important information regarding those two events. In March 2002 the author went to Pakistan as chief of counterterrorism operations for the CIA. He and the team members raided the Taliban Embassy in Pakistan and found files with 163 phone bills of calls to all over the U.S. that ended September 10, 2001 and picked up again on September 16. These were turned over to the FBI because they could reveal terrorist contacts in the U.S., but two years later the author learned the numbers had never been taken out of the box in which they were sent to the FBI, and they had been sent to a storage facility in Maryland never to be seen again! What if there were another major terrorist attack that could have been prevented by monitoring the people to whom those calls were made? Also the FBI requested Kiriakau give them not only the copies of the phone bills but the originals as well. Why would they want both if they were not going to take them out of the box but just put them in storage? Might there have been numbers in those files that the FBI didn’t want anyone else to know about? When Kiriakau returned to the U.S., he was promoted to executive assistant to the deputy director of the CIA and had to take a secrecy oath. When he asked the oath administrator why his pledge of silence was important, he was told: “Here’s the deal, next year in March 2003 we’re going to invade Iraq; we’re going to overthrow Saddam Hussein; and we’re going to open the largest air base in the world.” He was told this almost a year BEFORE the Iraq war began! So much for the reluctant invasion due to discovery of Weapons of Mass Destruction theory.] Continuing from the last section of Part 15 of this series regarding the occultic aspects of the Nazi/Power Elite (PE) Plan, some neo-Nazis secretly allied with Iran’s Fascist clerics to sponsor a search for the home of their common Aryan ancestors. I have already described in earlier series parts the Atlantis theory and how the Aryans located in the Shamballa area of the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet. One of the leading promoters of the Nazi-Iranian Aryan Axis was Swiss banker Ahmed Huber. Also in the last part of this series, I mentioned relevant to the Nazis and Iran that Operation Bedman (OB) began in 1948 to counter Soviet influence from expanding southward. OB received over 1 million dollars per year and funded Iranian Nazi elements like SUMKA. According to author Mark Gasiorowski in “The 1953 Coup d’Etat in Iran” ( International Journal of Middle East Studies , August 1987), OB even organized “attacks on mosques and public figures in the name of the Tudeh Party” (Soviet allies) to make them appear anti-Islamic. Two weeks after President Eisenhower was inaugurated in 1953, he met with top U.S. and British officials to discuss Operation Ajax which was to oust Iranian nationalist leader Mohammad Mossadegh."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Remember, PE agent Allen Dulles was Eisenhower’s CIA director after having worked with Nazi SS officers like Paul Dickopf in Switzerland during the War and with Nazi SS officers like Reinhard Gehlen since the War. OB had been approved by Frank Wisner (head of CIA covert operations), and Operation Ajax was facilitated by Allen Dulles, planned by Kermit Roosevelt, and organized by Don Wilber of the CIA. Operation Ajax called for replacing Mossadegh with General Zahedi who was protected from Mossadegh by the CIA. The U.S. approved military aid to the Zahedi forces, and on Monday, August 17, 1953 paid crowds began to demonstrate (including the fake Tudeh demonstrators). Reportedly, the Ayatollah Kashani was paid $10,000 to begin an anti-Mossadegh rally. The work of the PE via the CIA, the Nazi Gehlen Organization, and others was accomplished. Allen Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles were part of PE agent Col. Edward M. House’s group “the Inquiry,” and as I’ve mentioned earlier in this series, Allen Dulles worked with Himmler, Gehlen, and other Nazis as a dialectical counter to the USSR. In JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy (1992) by L. Fletcher Prouty (chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Kennedy years), the author refers to “evidence of a long-range view of Grand Strategy from a level above that of the leaders that we knew in public. The power elite had already set plans in motion for the post-WWII period that we have known as the Cold War. This is one of the best examples I have found revealing the work of the power elite, as distinct from that of the men who are the visible national leaders. As WWII came to a close, the long-range Cold War plan was already in existence, filling the vacuum by the end of that conflict. That long-range decision had to have originated from a center of power above the Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin level, because it ignored the WWII alliance represented by those three wartime leaders and went its own independent way.” The type of evidence to which Prouty refers was “the active role of U.S. Army officials in the unprecedented move of Hitler’s own intelligence chief, Gen. Reinhard Gehlen, directly into the U.S. Army as an officer by a special act of Congress. This was not a casual incident. The move, planned before the end of the war with Germany and directed from the top, was a classic example of the work of the power elite.... [Our] ‘leaders’ are all fine actors, and certainly not true rulers.... This is true not only in the world of politics but is equally true of banking, industry, academia, and religion.” Regarding the PE, Prouty explained: “The power elite is not a group from one nation or even of one alliance of nations. It operates throughout the world and no doubt has done so for many, many centuries.” Buckminster Fuller described them as “vastly ambitious individuals who [have] become so effectively powerful because of their ability to remain invisible while operating behind the national scenery.... Always their victories [are] in the name of some powerful sovereign-ruled country. The real power structures [are] always the invisible ones behind the visible sovereign powers.” During WWII, Winston Churchill made reference to intimate friends of a “High Cabal” (remember David Rockefeller’s admission that he was part of a “secret cabal”). After WWII, the Nazi Gehlen Organization was used in the Cold War against the Soviets. And just like PE agent Raymond Robins (a protégé of Col. House) could tell Lenin what"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"to do, shortly after PE member David Rockefeller visited the USSR in the early 1960s, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev suddenly found himself exiled to Siberia. The movement toward a New World Order has been in operation for some time. Sumner Welles, who revealed part of the secret Nazi plan, on June 17, 1942 called for the early creation of an international organization, “the setting up of a new world order on a permanent basis” (see reporter William Murphy, Jr.’s article in the June 18, 1942 Philadelphia Inquirer ). The Nazis (supporters of National Socialism) under the secret plan today will not be recognizable. Just like Esso (Rockefeller Standard Oil) money was used to “buy up a few radicals to make a lot of radical commotion” in the 1960s so the PE’s move to the Left wouldn’t be recognizable as equivalently radical (see James Simon Kunen’s The Strawberry Statement ), the secret Nazis today aren’t goosestepping around and wearing swastikas. Just as Communist Chinese businessmen today wear Western attire rather than Maoist peasant garb, and their universities have programs in entrepreneurship, the secret Nazis today and those who have been working with them are “respectable” corporate executives, bank presidents, etc. In Part 8 of this series, I mentioned how President George H.W. Bush was close to Nazi sympathizer Laszlo Pasztor, who was a member of Hungary’s Nazi-like party called the Arrow Cross. In the U.S., Pasztor headed the Coalitions of the Americas housed in the Free Congress Foundation (FCF). According to Kelleigh Nelson’s NewsWithViews column “Saving the Republic, Part 2,” Pasztor was the “right hand man” of Paul Weyrich, who founded the FCF and was a co-founder of the Heritage Foundation. Nelson also wrote that “Roger Pearson, writer and organizer for the Nazi-connected Northern League for Pan-Nordic Friendship, joined the editorial board of Policy Review (Heritage’s monthly publication) in 1977.” Pearson allegedly had bragged to an associate that he helped hide Nazi “Angel of Death” Dr. Josef Mengele, and in 1980, Pearson left Heritage after a 1978 Washington Post expose titled “The Fascist Specter Behind the World Anti-Red League.” With the Cold War continuing for decades after WWII, it was natural for many patriotic Americans to join various anti-Communist organizations. Unfortunately, organizations like The World Anti-Communist League (WACL, whose world chairman in 1978 was Roger Pearson) were also perfect places for secret Nazis and their sympathizers to find cover. While many of them were removed, in 1984 WACL affiliate The Latin American Anti-Communist Confederation was linked by columnist Jack Anderson to death squads. This caused some to remember how Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie had been active with death squads in Bolivia. According to Inside the League: The Shocking Expose of How Terrorists, Nazis, and Latin American Death Squads Have Infiltrated the World Anti-Communist League (1986) by Scott Anderson and Jon Lee Anderson: “Even before the dust had settled on Hitler’s shattered Third Reich, many of those responsible were escaping to work for the formation of a Fourth Reich. From their havens, they have nurtured their cause and kept it alive, they have recruited younger generations and they have formed networks for safety and strength, bonds that remain to this day.” While most people who think of escaped Nazis remember notables like Mengele and Barbie, there is another “type of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Nazi, who is far more powerful, public, and dangerous than other types: these are the Croatians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Latvians, who carried out the German-dictated massacres, who never faced a Nuremberg, and who joined the World Anti-Communist League.

The reason this is so is simple: many of them were recruited by American and British intelligence, brought into the United States and Canada, allowed to rise to prominent positions in their émigré communities, and ultimately to revise history.... Through their front groups and their involvement in American politics, the Nazi collaborators have blended in and become respectable.” Nazi angel of death Josef Mengele 'created twin town in Brazil' The Nazi doctor Josef Mengele is responsible for the astonishing number of twins in a small Brazilian town, an Argentine historian has claimed. By Nick Evans in Buenos Aires Published: 8:00PM GMT 21 Jan 2009"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"One in five pregnancies in the small Brazilian town have resulted in twins - most of them blond haired and blue eyed The steely hearted \"Angel of Death\", whose mission was to create a master race fit for the Third Reich, was the resident medic at Auschwitz from May 1943 until his flight in the face of the Red Army advance in January 1945. His task was to carry out experiments to discover by what method of genetic quirk twins were produced – and then to artificially increase the Aryan birthrate for his master, Adolf Hitler. Now, a historian claims, Mengele's notorious experiments may have borne fruit. For years scientists have failed to discover why as many as one in five pregnancies in a small Brazilian town have resulted in twins – most of them blond haired and blue eyed. But residents of Candido Godoi now claim that Mengele made repeated visits there in the early 1960s, posing at first as a vet but then offering medical treatment to the women of the town. Shuttling between Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, he managed to evade justice before his death in 1979, but his dreams of a Nazi master race appeared unfulfilled. In a new book, Mengele: the Angel of Death in South America , the Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa, a specialist in the post-war Nazi flight to South America, has painstakingly pieced together the Nazi doctor's mysterious later years. After speaking to the townspeople of Candido Godoi, he is convinced that Mengele continued his genetic experiments with twins – with startling results. He reveals how, after working with cattle farmers in Argentina to increase their stock, Mengele fled the country after fellow Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, was kidnapped by Israeli agents."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"He claims that Mengele found refuge in the German enclave of Colonias Unidas, Paraguay, and from there, in 1963, began to make regular trips to another predominantly German community just over the border in Brazil – the farming community of Candido Godoi. And, Mr Camaras claims, it was here that soon after the birthrate of twins began to spiral. \"I think Candido Godoi may have been Mengele's laboratory, where he finally managed to fulfil his dreams of creating a master race of blond haired, blue eyed Aryans,\" he said. \"There is testimony that he attended women, followed their pregnancies, treated them with new types of drugs and preparations, that he talked of artificial insemination in human beings, and that he continued working with animals, proclaiming that he was capable of getting cows to produce male twins.\" The urbane German who arrived in Candido Godoi was remembered with fondness by many of the townspeople. \"He told us he was a vet,\" said Aloisi Finkler, a local farmer interviewed by Mr Camarasa. \"He asked about illnesses we had among our animals, and told us not to worry, he could cure them. He appeared a cultured and dignified man.\" Another farmer, Leonardo Boufler, said: \"He went from farm to farm checking the animals. He checked them for TB, and injected those that were infected. He said he could carry out artificial insemination of cows and humans, which we thought impossible as in those days it was unheard of.\" But the Nazi eugenicist did not concentrate on animals alone. A former mayor and town doctor, Anencia Flores da Silva, set out to try to solve the town's mystery. He interviewed hundreds of people, and discovered one character who crept on cropping up: an itinerant medic calling himself Rudolph Weiss. Dr da Silva said: \"In the testimonies we collected we came across women who were treated by him, he appeared to be some sort of rural medic who went from house to house. He attended women who had varicose veins and gave them a potion which he carried in a bottle, or tablets which he brought with him. Sometimes he carried out dental work, and everyone remembers he used to take blood.\" The people of Candido Godoi now largely accept that a Nazi war criminal was an inadvertent guest of theirs for several years in the early 1960s. The town's official crest shows two identical profiles and a road sign welcomes visitors to a \"Farming Community and Land of the Twins\". There is also a museum, the House of the Twins. While the twins birthrate varies widely in different countries, it is typically about one in 80 pregnancies – a statistic that has left Mr Camarasa certain in his claim that Mengele was successfully pursuing his dreams of creating a master race, a real-life Boys from Brazil ."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"\"Nobody knows for sure exactly what date Mengele arrived in Candido Godoi, but the first twins were born in 1963, the year in which we first hear reports of his presence,\" he said. **Apparently, there is a large following of the Nazi party known as SUMKA in Iran.

Cuddy, Ph.D. May 3, 2010 NewsWithViews.com Recently I received calls from two people preparing TV documentaries. One of them represented a company that had produced programs for the major national television networks, and currently is preparing one for the History Channel. The spokeswoman said their focus would be the hidden meaning of the Statue of Liberty (SL), but she was also interested in any connections there might be with the Rockefellers, Nazis, and the Muslim Brotherhood. The SL was presented to the U.S. in 1884 and dedicated October 28, 1886. It was built by French engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel was a Freemason as was its designer Auguste Bartholdi, and the SL was a gift from the French Grand Orient Temple Masons to the Masons of America. The SL’s official title is “Liberty Enlightening the World,” with “Liberte” being one of the watchwords of the French Revolution of 1789. At the Masonic congress meeting in Paris on July 16, 1889, Louis Amiable affirmed that “the French Freemasons of the 18th Century made the Revolution,” and Colfavru asserted that “amongst its adepts” was Voltaire “under the respectful and fraternal patronage of Ben Franklin.” Franklin helped initiate Voltaire into Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"These “adepts” to whom Colfavru referred were from the Enlightenment period. And “Enlightened Ones” is also the translation of the word “Illuminati” who, according to the Freemason Marquis de Luchet (who obtained the position of Bibliothec for Voltaire) in Essai Sur La Secte Des Illumines (1789), infiltrated the French Masonic lodges. To the Illuminati, Liberte meant moral license, and during the French Revolution, a prostitute was placed on the altar at the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The SL looks like Semiramis, including the 7 rays coming from her head. (for pictures see next to last page of my April 26/May 1, 2003 NewsWithViews article). Semiramis is the legendary Assyrian queen who reputedly founded Babylon in the early 9th Century B.C. and was known for her sexual license. Voltaire even wrote a play called Semiramis. The Babylonians in The Holy Bible were known for their rebellion against God, and even before Babylonia existed, the Babylonians’ ancestors built the Tower of Babel as a rebellion against God. Recently, there was a European Community poster showing their rebuilding of the Tower of Babel today (see two pictures from the middle of dennis 75 ), and it is modeled after 16th century artist Pieter Bruegel’s painting of the Tower of Babel, with the added slogan “Europe: Many Tongues, One Voice.” The building in which the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union (Javier Solana) is located also looks like the Tower of Babel. Is Babylon relevant to the SL and New York City (NYC) today? In 1997, there was an engraving placed on St. John the Divine Cathedral in NYC that showed the city being destroyed. This, no doubt, refers to the Rev. 14:8 saying that a “great city” will be attacked, as it reads: “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city.” We know that this modern Babylon will fall in large part due to sexual license (fornication) for which Semiramis (which looks like the SL) was known. We know that “the great whore... sitteth on many waters,” and NYC is at the juncture of the Hudson River, East River, New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. We know the destroyed city is on the coast because Rev. 18:17-18 states that “every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors... cried when they saw the smoke of her burning.” We know that her burning occurs in modern times because Rev. 18:9 states “the kings of the earth... shall see the smoke of her burning.” And that would only be possible within instantaneous televised pictures. We also know the destruction will probably be caused by some type of nuclear device because Rev. 18:19 indicates that “in one hour is she made desolate.” Interesting also is the fact that in a 4th Century A.D. translation of The Holy Bible , Rev. 18:23 reads: “And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee.” Emma Lazarus’ Sonnet, “The New Colossus,” on the SL ends with “I lift my lamp beside the golden door.” Since rebellion against God will be the primary reason for the destruction of the modern Babylon, it is appropriate to note that rebellion against God was the main characteristic of Lucifer. At the front of Rules for Radicals (1971) by community organizer leader Saul Alinsky (admired by President Barack Obama), he offers an “acknowledgement” to “the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom—Lucifer.”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"At the time French Freemasons gave the SL to the U.S., former Confederate Brig. Gen. Albert Pike was Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasons, Southern Jurisdiction. And exactly 100 years before Alinsky’s acknowledgement to Lucifer, Ku Klux Klan chief justice Pike praised Lucifer in his Morals and Dogma (1871). The next year (1872), Pike again praised Lucifer in his Indo=Aryan Deities and Worship (As Contained in the) Rig Veda . Pike reorganized the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and in their levels of initiation, Freemasons say they want “more light.” The word Lucifer means “Light Bearer.” It should be noted at this point that most Freemasons don’t really understand the symbols of the Craft, as Pike said in Morals and Dogma that they are “intentionally misled by false interpretations” regarding these. Pike wrote that “it is not intended” that Masons in the lower or Blue Degrees “shall understand them: but it is intended that [they] shall imagine” they do. He said the true meanings of Masonic symbols are “reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.” Pike also authored Irano=Aryan Faith and Doctrine (As Contained in the) Zend=Vesta (1874), and he often emphasized Aryan (elite) man, expressing his belief in the concept of the “Aryan master race” in his Lectures of the Arya (1873). Pike used the Aryan symbol of the swastika as the Masonic symbol because he believed Freemasonry was the original religion of the Aryans as written in the Vedas (from a July 6, 1875 letter by Pike). In case you think modern Masons disavowed Pike’s Morals and Dogma , in the January 1989 edition of the Mason’s New Age journal, Sovereign Grand Commander C. Fred Kleinknecht wrote: “The apex of our teachings has been the rituals of our degrees and Morals and Dogma , written by Sovereign Grand Commander Albert Pike over a century ago.” From where did this concept of an Aryan elite come? Plato in his 4th Century B.C. work The Republic emphasized rule by an elite Republic of Philosophers. He said that 200 years before his time, the Greek philosopher Solon visited the priests of the Temple of Isis in Sais, Egypt (former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole has been for decades a Shriner/Freemason of Isis Temple in Salina, Kansas). SL sculptor Bartholdi originally planned it as a statue of the goddess Isis, “a robed woman holding aloft a torch,” overlooking the area of the Suez Canal. Isis is also known as the Roman goddess Juno (there is a 725 B.C. statue of Juno holding a torch), as the Greek goddess Athena (in New Ager Jean Houston’s co-authored Riding Into Your Mythic Life she refers to the SL perhaps standing “as one of the manifestations for the dynamic of Athena’s evolving form”), as the Sabine goddess Feronia (goddess of liberty), and as the Babylonian goddess Ishtar or Semiramis mentioned earlier. The priests at the temple of Isis told Solon about the Aryans being the only one of seven civilizations to survive the destruction of Atlantis (Sir Francis Bacon in 1624 authored The New Atlantis referring to America), and that the Aryans relocated in Shamballa near Tibet. Their symbol was the swastika representing an elite race of people. When Allied forces entered Berlin in 1945, they found 1000 Tibetan lamas’ corpses in Nazi uniforms, and the Nazis’ symbol was the swastika."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Swastikas have also been in the building at Yale University for the secret society of Skull & Bones to which both Bush presidents have belonged. Skull & Bones was begun in 1832 by William Huntington Russell and modeled after a German university corps. Russell matriculated in Germany at Tugenbund and Berschenschaften, where the Illuminati had formed student societies at universities. The Illuminati tutored Alexander I, Emperor of Russia 1801-1825. Six years after Alexander’s death, Helena von Hahn was born in Russia in 1831. She was the daughter of Col. Peter von Hahn of the ancient von Hahn family in Germany. Her married name would be Blavatsky, and she would become a close friend (and Co- Mason) with Albert Pike. On October 10, 1875, she founded the Theosophical Society in the U.S., and in 1877 authored Isis Unveiled . In the 1880s, she co-edited Lucifer with Annie Besant who wore a swastika pendant. Besant was asked by William Stead to write for his Pall Mall Gazette a review of Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine (1888), which Adolph Hitler would keep beside his bed and learn of “the power of” the swastika. Stead was a confidant of Freemason Cecil Rhodes who formed the secret Society of the Elect “to take the government of the whole world.” Rhodes’ mentor at Oxford University was John Ruskin, who has a swastika at the top of his gravestone. Rhodes Trust member Rudyard Kipling has swastikas on many of his early books. Annie Besant was succeeded by occultist Alice Bailey whose first works were published by Lucifer Publishing, which became Lucis Trust and managed the UN Meditation Room for many years. Bailey often wrote of the need for a “new world order” and “points of light” connected to “service.” President George H.W. Bush (Skull & Bones member) would years later speak of the need for these same things. Relevant to “points of light” and the 7 rays of the SL, Alice Bailey authored The Seventh Ray: Revealer of the New Age indicating that there would be a “future scientific religion of Light .” She explained “that seven great rays exist in the cosmos.... They might be regarded as seven intelligent Entities through Whom the plan is working out.” “The plan” includes a “Federation of Nations” that would be taking rapid shape by 2025 A.D., and there would be a “synthesis in business, in religion, and in politics.” According to Bailey, this would come about in the Aquarian Age, as we are moving from the “Piscean Age, governed by the sixth Ray of Devotion and Idealism,” to the “Aquarian Age, ruled by the seventh Ray of Order and Organization.” She said the time of the sixth Ray Piscean Age was dominated by “Many Christian people. Fanatics. Numbers of earnest Churchmen of all the world’s religions.” But the seventh Ray Aquarian Age would be dominated by “Masons. Financiers. Great Businessmen and organizers of all kinds.” (Perhaps community organizers?) Bailey explained that Masonry emanated from Shamballa, and that on the seventh Ray there would be “Your Masonic opportunity and your ability to organize and rule.” Connecting Masons, Lucifer, and the Aryans of Shamballa, leading Masonic philosopher Manly P. Hall in The Lost Keys of Freemasonry (1923) revealed that “the seething energies of Lucifer are in his [the Mason’s] hands.” Hall wrote in The Secret Destiny of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"America (1944) that The Order of the Quest symbol is on the cover of Sir Francis Bacon’s The New Atlantis and that Masonic Grand Master Ben Franklin was a member of that secret Order. Hall explained that Bacon’s secret society was set up in America before the middle of the 17th century, and that it was most powerful in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In Bernard Fay’s Revolution and Freemasonry—1680-1800, one finds that the Boston Tea Party was initiated from a tavern known as the “Arms of Freemasonry” or the “Green Dragon.” The “Green Dragon” was also the name of the esoteric Buddhist society through which the colony of Tibetan lamas settled in Berlin (1000 corpses of whom were later found in Nazi uniforms). As stated earlier, the Aryans of Atlantis supposedly went to Shamballa, near Tibet. Madame Blavatsky in her writings referred to the Aryans as the 5th race in human civilization, and she also referred to the “6th root race.” In the Scottish Rite Freemasons’ journal New Age (September 1950), C. William Smith wrote about “the unification of all races, religions and creeds... a new religion of ‘The Great Light’... and the American race will be the 6th Aryan civilization... for the dawn of the New Age of the world.” Concerning Freemasonry recently, author Dan Brown’s latest book focuses on their House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. (a statue of Luciferian and Masonic Sovereign Grand Commander Albert Pike stands in the city). However, interestingly absent from Brown’s volume is the fact that a swastika is embedded just above a serpentine/dragon figure on the façade of the House of the Temple! (see paragraph two of dennis 173 for link). LOOKING BACKWARDS By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. December 28, 2009 NewsWithViews.com [Note: This series of articles is written from the perspective The Order, which by 2100 has come to control the world.] It is the year 2100 C.E. (Common Era, as A.D. is no longer used), and The Order of the New World or New Civilization has decreed that a history of its rise to power be written by its Ministry of Peace. That is what this paper relates, as we are now living in the most wonderful of times under the guidance of the benevolent Order. First, it would probably be helpful to describe the model strategy used by The Order to obtain power over the people of the world. Because it was believed that the most difficult people (beside those fervently religious) to bring under The Order’s control would be those having a republican form of government, the model strategy used came from Philip Freneau’s “Rules for Changing a Limited Republican Government into an"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Unlimited Hereditary One” ( American Museum , July 1792), which was an unheeded warning to Americans who supported a republican form of government. This was written shortly after the United States began as a republic, and in this work, Freneau said the limitations of the Republic’s (e.g., the U.S.) Constitution should be emphasized with “precedents and phrases” (e.g., due process) “shuffled in.” He next said that civil turbulence in the Republic should be contrasted with the stability existing under a hereditary elite. The “grand nostrum” of Freneau’s outline was the creation of debt “made as big as possible, as perpetual as possible, in as few hands as possible,” and as complicated as possible. He then said, “A great debt will require great taxes.... Money will be put under the direction of the government, and government under the direction of money” (e.g., banking elite). The next step would be to create “artificial divisions” within society (e.g., “divide and conquer” strategy) which would “smother the true natural divisions between the few” (elite) “and the general mass of people, attached to their republican government and republican interests.” Freneau then indicated that the elite would give a popular name, such as “the general welfare,” to the usurped power so that those opposing the elite could be negatively labeled as “opposing the general welfare” of the people. He described how a military defeat (e.g., the Vietnam War) would “be turned into a political victory for the elite.” And lastly, he noted that those warning about the elite’s attempt to seize power would themselves be labeled as “enemies to the established government.” Freneau declared that this charge would “be reiterated and reverberated till at last such confusion and uncertainty be produced that the people, being not able to find out where the truth lies, withdraw their attention from the contest.” This last element of the model strategy was particularly useful to The Order in “turning off” people’s support for patriotic militia. Relevant to this and to the rise of The Order in the 20th century were the following statements published by the National Education Association’s Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development in To Nurture Humaneness (1970). Robert Ayres stated that “words like ‘patriot’ may in time become obsolescent.” Dan Dodson noted that “The old order is passing.... Social controls cannot be left to blind chance and unplanned change—usually attributed to God. Man must be the builder of new forms of social organization which will be more fulfilling to more people.” John Loughary indicated that “Many daily decisions and value judgments now made by the individual will soon be made for him.” And Raymond Houghton revealed that “while absolute behavior control is imminent, the crucial question concerns itself with identifying the practical critical factor as to when sufficient behavior control is accomplished to make the question of absolute behavior control only academic.... The critical point of behavior control, in effect, is sneaking up on mankind without his self-conscious realization that a crisis is at hand. Man will not ever know that it is about to happen. He will never self- consciously know that it has happened.” As early as May 1966 (in Esquire magazine), Dr. John McConnell, professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, had been quoted as saying: “I teach a course called The Psychology of Influence, and I begin it by stating categorically that the time has come when, if you give me any normal human being and a couple of weeks... I can"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"change his behavior from what it is not to whatever you want it to be, if it’s physically possible.... I can turn him from a Christian to a communist.... Look, we can do these things. We can control behavior. Now, who’s going to decide what’s to be done?...” Then 5 years later (September 1971), Milton Rokeach wrote in “Persuasion That Persists” ( Psychology Today ): “Suppose you could take a group of people, give them a twenty- minute pencil-and-paper task, talk to them for ten to twenty minutes afterward, and thereby produce long-range changes in core values and personal behavior in a significant portion of this group. For openers, it would of course have major implications for education, government, propaganda, and therapy.... My colleagues and I have in the last five years achieved the kinds of results suggested in the first paragraph of this article.... It now seems to be within man’s power to alter experientially another person’s basic values, and to control the direction of the change.” Today, freedom exists under The Order, but it is “managed” for the good of the people. For example, people have a choice in foods to eat, but it is from a selection The Order has determined is healthful for them. Initially, the people had been allowed the illusion of freedom by telling them they could eat whatever they wished. However, if they did not choose from The Order’s selection, their insurance premiums were made so prohibitively high that most “volunteered” to choose as The Order desired. It was not difficult ot know what each person was eating, as every individual’s Omnicard (Smart Card) recorded what he or she purchased at grocery stores, restaurants, etc. The Order had been able to take control of the world’s food supply many decades ago as megafarms bought up nearly all of the small (family) farms, and the megafarms came under the control of giant food processors (e.g., Archer-Daniels-Midland) which in turn were given production quotas by national governments and then by The Order. In addition to the establishment of criteria for healthful foods, the people happily reported to assigned exercise groups where their physical fitness could be monitored and tracked. Transportation to and from these groups and everywhere else has been accelerated by the development of photon energy, which also powers households and industries. Even space travel is now commonplace because of the development of electromagnetic (EM) power, as EM force fields are emitted by space crafts in front of themselves, accelerating the crafts forward at ever increasing speeds. The Order was able to begin its movement toward world control over a century ago, before 2000 C.E., by gaining control of the existing “processes.” For example, the people were allowed the illusion that they had real political choices during elections, but “big money” from big corporations primarily to Republicans and from big Labor primarily to Democrats allowed for the screening of political candidates as they rose on the political ladder to determine if they would be acceptable to The Order. Once computerized voting was introduced, it was also very easy for The Order to program the computers to “rig” election results and to know how everyone voted and whether they voted in a “politically correct” manner. Video cameras showed each person placing his or her ballot in a computer, which clearly displayed the number for each voter (e.g., voter number 49 or 273, etc.) and it was a simple matter for a representative of The Order to retrieve those ballots (e.g., ballot 49 or 273, etc.), from the machine to see how those individuals voted."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Even in the area of education, the credentialing “process” for superintendents, principals and others became so regulated that even if some disgruntled citizens successfully removed an education official objectionable to them, the official’s replacement would have to come from the same pool of “credentialed” educators. Once the people had come to see that it was useless to challenge The Order (which was, after all, providing for their health, safety, security and all of their other needs), they came to be dependent upon and to love The Order of the New World. The people’s consciousness had been changed so that they have come to accept the New Civilization of the World in which we now live happily. In 1973, feminist leader Gloria Steinem said, “By the year 2000 we will, I hope, raise our children to believe in human potential, not God.” This, of course, was accomplished via the establishment of a humanistic code of values to which all could agree, called our common faith. Pope John Paul II’s statement supporting the theory of evolution over a hundred years ago helped tremendously in this regard, as it provided much needed support for our undermining of the belief many had in the inerrancy of the Bible. The first head of the World Health Organization, Brock Chisholm, had earlier announced that the concepts of right and wrong taught to children by their parents and religious leaders had to be done away with. And those (e.g., fundamentalists) who objected to this new way of thinking were described as having “mental health” problems which need to be treated by The Order’s approved psychiatrists, psychologists and social service workers. Once Bible reading and prayer had been removed from public schools, and the public’s belief in moral absolutes had been eroded via a steady diet of values clarification lessons in those schools leading to the acceptance of situation ethics, it was not too difficult to gain public acceptance of abortions and other anti-life activities. There was even the election of a president whom the people knew to have committed clearly immoral acts, and to whom a majority of the people gave high approval ratings even though he supported the grotesque infanticide of partial-birth abortions. The people still longed, though, for some type of spirituality, so unlike the failed Communists and Nazis of the previous century, The Order did not try to eliminate the concept of God, but rather redefined God as being the cosmic force of love. This concept of a non-judgmental God who would never send anyone to something called hell allowed the development of The Order’s One-World Religion based upon our common faith in the goodness of men and women. Once again, this concept was greatly assisted by Pope John Paul II and other religious leaders who pronounced that Buddhists and those of other religions could also enter into heaven. The Order’s New World Religion of common faith based on common values includes a synthesis of Western Scientism and Eastern mysticism along with some New Age elements. Such efforts at syncretism had been tried earlier in the first part of the 20th century, but had been thwarted by individuals such as G.K. Chesterton who, in The Everlasting Man (1925), had written: “They call a Parliament of Religions (1893) as a reunion of all the peoples; but it is only a reunion of all the prigs. Yet exactly such a pantheon had been set up two thousand years before by the shores of the Mediterranean; and Christians were invited to set up the image of Jesus side by side with the image of Jupiter, of Mithras, of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Osiris, of Atys, or of Ammon. It was the refusal of the Christians that was the turning- point of history. If the Christians had accepted, they and the whole world would have certainly, in a grotesque but exact metaphor, gone to pot. They would all have been boiled down to one lukewarm liquid in that great pot of cosmopolitan corruption in which all the other myths and mysteries were already melting. It was an awful and an appalling escape. Nobody understands the nature of the Church, or the ringing note of the creed descending from antiquity, who does not realize that the world once very nearly died of broad-mindedness and the brotherhood of all religions.” In the latter half of the 20th century, however, the people were successfully conditioned to compromise their faiths to accept the syncretism of the world’s religions. Because one’s religion seemed to matter less and less, people stopped going to churches, which were turned by The Order into houses of entertainment, as people increasingly seemed to “worship” having fun. Perhaps the first example relevant to this was the conversion of St. John the Baptist Church in the Pittsburth, PA area to a Brew- pub in the mid-1990s (see photo). The people didn’t protest when the music and lyrics from many traditional religious songs (e.g., from Handel’s Messiah , “The Hallelujah Chorus,” and from “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen”) were used in commercial jingles. The masses of people were kept happy, and formerly illegal drugs were more freely distributed by The Order toward that end. Television, with its quickly changing hyper-reality images (in ads and other programming), and other forms of entertainment became useful in psychologically conditioning the people to accept new lifestyles desired by The Order (centuries ago, yogis had devised candles with a fast flicker effect that could change states of consciousness). Rhythm in music was used to soothe or to stimulate people’s emotions, which were now emphasized over the intellect. Talk show hosts approved by The Order were continuously programmed on radio and television both to allow the venting of frustrations and to mollify fears, reassuring the people that they were still free and had real political choices, naturally within the limits established by The Order for the people’s own good. The viewing of sports events continued to be a favorite pastime for the masses, and so that no one team gained superiority in any sport for any length of time, the outcomes of competition were carefully managed by The Order without the public’s knowledge. This did not even require the knowledge of individual players as to what the outcome of any game was to be, as simple signals by representatives of The Order on either side of a court or playing field could alert the opposition as to the appropriate defense to call. It was actually amusing to see how ignorant people had become, as they didn’t realize how"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"easy it was to “rig” an athletic event. All it took was one player deliberately missing one shot or kick or catch at a key point in the game! [Note: Letter written to Rick Warren on January 3, 2010—The next time you discuss the issue of abortion with anyone (including President Obama), would you please tell them that in The Holy Bible , God clearly states that He hates the shedding of innocent blood, and that He said BEFORE He formed us in the womb He knew us. That means that if President Obama’s mother had aborted him, she would have been killing someone already known to God as Barack Obama, NOT just a blob of tissue that might later become Barack Obama. Sincerely, Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. Regarding the attempt Christmas Day 2009 by the Nigerian jihadist to blow up the plane headed for Detroit, one could easily predict such an effort. When the government’s response to 9/11 was “let’s not point fingers” of blame, the message was no one in the federal government is going to be held responsible for not preventing the deaths of about 3000 Americans. Since no one was fired as a result of the 9/11 tragedy, federal employees got the impression that their lack of vigilance in the future would also not result in serious consequences if another terrorist attack occurred here. Further facilitating this impression, President Obama on January 5, 2010 said regarding the Christmas Day attempt that he “will not tolerate finger pointing by federal agencies.” And on January 4, Sen. Joe Lieberman said, “Officials should not be looking to point fingers.” President Obama’s lack of “finger pointing” and holding specific people responsible for their failure to prevent the Nigerian jihadist from boarding the airplane will probably result in future terrorist attacks. The President’s characterization of what happened as a “systemic failure” apparently means there is safety in numbers for incompetents just as there was after 9/11. Perhaps we should call this the Bush-Obama Principle—if many people are incompetent, then no one will be singled out for blame or be fired!] Because the public always wanted something “new” (similar to the Athenians in the Biblical reference of Acts 17:21), “change” was constantly structured into society (e.g., fashions, cars, etc.), and President Barack Obama’s theme of “change” in the early 21st century helped in this regard. All new cars were then fitted with On-Board Diagnostics III computers (each having its own electronic signature), which The Order could command (by global positioning satellites transmitting signals to the computers) to shut off the engine of anyone attempting to flee The Order’s control. The people had already been conditioned to accept the monitoring of their movements when late in the 20th century, video cameras were installed on interstate highways, in North Carolina for example, “to obtain information about travel patterns.” The cameras recorded license plate numbers, and motorists using many of one metropolitan area’s streets and highways were asked at checkpoints about the origin, destination and purpose of their trips. As one of the major forerunners of The Order, Bertrand Russell, had stated, “Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticisms of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.” People also"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"were kept busy so that they did not have time to analyze what was happening to them and possibly resist what The Order was doing for their own good. More and more women were encouraged to go to work to find self-fulfillment, thus enabling The Order to have more and more children placed in its approved daycare centers, where its child- rearing experts could shape the children’s values to accept The Order’s New World. People had to obtain licenses to become parents, and in order to mold the new man and woman desired by The Order, advanced eugenic projects were conducted based upon earlier research funded by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations. These were based on the philosophy of leading Fabian Socialist Sir Julian Huxley who, as first Director- General of UNESCO in the previous century, had written in UNESCO: Its Purpose and Its Philosophy about the need for a philosophy of “scientific world humanism,” about the need to “transfer full sovereignty from separate nations to a world organization... political unification in some sort of world government,” about the need to promote “a single world culture,” and then he stated: “Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.” The physicians of The Order now routinely replace human organs with the bodily organs of cows, pigs and baboons. And the doctors laugh amongst themselves as they reflect upon the fact that in the previous century, the people would have expressed outrage if Nazi doctors had performed the same transplants. Coincidentally, as late as 1972 former Nazi SS officer Paul Dickopf directed Interpol, which was begun in the 1920s. Its formation was overseen by Raymond Fosdick who also founded (on behalf of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.) the eugenics—promoting Bureau of Social Hygiene, and who in his memorial history of (Rockefeller’s) General Education Board indicated the Board was part of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.’s effort toward “this goal of social control.” The Order trained Ministers of Euthanasia so that people would not suffer unnecessarily when their usefulness to The Order has ended. This was done by euthanasia chemical compositions patented by Michigan State University. On July 1, 1994 a law firm representing the university declared that the compositions were intended for use in lower animals, but then added: “If it should ever become legal to use the compositions on human beings, the patent claims should encompass the use of compositions of the present invention for this purpose.” Funding for the university’s research in this project came from Hoechst AG, parent company of Roussel-Uclaf (developer of the RU-486 abortion pill) and stepchild of I.G. Farben, which manufactured the Nazi concentration camps gas in the 1940s and had connections with Rockefeller enterprises (John D. Rockefeller III in 1952 founded the Population Council). Dr. Richard Day (national medical director of Planned Parenthood from 1965-1968) in March 1969 had explained that euthanasia would be more accepted as the cost of medical care intentionally would be made burdensomely high. This led to the planned “health care crisis” of the early 21st century that facilitated the acceptance of a national health care plan that helped move the U.S. more and more toward Socialism."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"As another one of the major forerunners of The Order, George Bernard Shaw, had stated: “...under Socialism you would not be allowed to be poor. You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed whether you liked it or not. If it were discovered that you had not the character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, you might possibly be executed in a kindly manner....” Shaw’s reference to Socialism is applicable because The Order manages a World Socialist Government resulting from a synthesis of Western Capitalism and Eastern Communism. The experimental model for this synthesis began in July 1997 when Hong Kong (capitalist) was turned over to China (communist), resulting in Hong Kong’s synthesis into a Socialist Government. Once the people of the world had come to value economic considerations more than moral considerations, The Order’s path to power was made much easier. For example, China’s human rights violations were deliberately overlooked by national governments, which wanted to maintain their businesses’ access to the huge population and markets of China. Not only did national governments overlook China’s human rights violations, but the people in general had been conditioned to ignore the fact that many goods in stores were produced by slave or forced labor in China, Russia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Philippines, etc. Before the American Civil War, the Southern planter class justified enslavement of blacks in the U.S. by saying they were better off than being enslaved or killed by their conquerors in Africa. In the late 20th and early 21st century, many Americans justified their benefiting from slave or forced labor in other countries by saying those laborers were better off than they otherwise would have been. One result of this abandonment of moral considerations was that early in the 21st century China became a world economic power and shortly thereafter a world military power with nuclear weapons equal to those of any other nation. With this might, they were able to obtain hegemony over Southeast Asia, take over Taiwan, and threaten Japan and South Korea. This caused an international crisis, resulting in the other nations of the world uniting to resist Chinese expansionism, thus planting the seeds for the acceptance of World Government. Similarly in the areas of economics, a series of international economic crises (e.g., in the Fall of 2008 C.E.) caused the nations of the world to unite existing regional economic trading blocs under the already growing authority of the World Trade Organization. A new world financial and monetary system was then established with the “Phoenix” in 2018 C.E. replacing the dollar, yen, and other currencies. All societies became cashless, as Smart Cards (called Omnicards) were issued to everyone. These were then superseded by the L.U.C.I.D. system’s Universal Biometrics Card (UBC) containing information from iris scans, DNA genotyping and Human Leukocyte Antigen data, all within an International Standardization Organization (ISO) Reference Model. The UBCs also contained each person’s education, health, financial and other records, which were all kept on file at The Order’s central databank. It was amusing to see the Christians, who were familiar with the Biblical reference to the “mark of the Beast,” so willingly accept these UBCs with individually assigned numbers without which they could not buy or sell anything. Biochips were also implanted under everyone’s skin at birth so that they would be locatable.

It was curious that many Christians went along with this despite the fact that Leviticus 19:28 said: “Ye shall not... print any marks upon you: I am the Lord.” Community service acceptable to The Order was required for anyone to obtain employment. Of course, the people were allowed the illusion of freedom by telling them they did not have to engage in such service, but that their admission to higher education and their obtainment of employment were dependent upon their performing this service. Naturally, most “volunteered” to serve. Jobs were appropriately selected for individuals based upon their usefulness to The Order, and employers used Total Quality Management (TQM) principles for which employees had been prepared by School-to- Work programs approved by The Order. All students, including those homeschooled or in private schools, were required to pass subjective outcome- or performance-based tests prepared by The Order before they could pursue higher education or be employed. These tests were designed to separate the future elite of The Order from the masses of labor serfs who would perform the service jobs in the techno-feudal society The Order was creating. The concept of “lifelong learning” was used by The Order as another excuse whereby files could be maintained on everyone from cradle to grave. All students had to obtain School-to-Work skill certificates, and workers’ credentials (demographic and educational/training information, occupational experience, etc., as in the Nazis’ Arbeitscbuch or Communist Chinese Dangan) were contained on their UBCs. Early in the previous century, revolutionary Antonio Gramsci (among whose followers were the last head of the old Soviet Empire, Mikhail Gorbachev, and his wife) theorized that to take control of a nation, one must attack its culture, including education and music. Relevant to education, Marxist philosopher Gyorgy Lukacs (who introduced sex education in Hungary’s schools as their Commissar for Culture and Education) was admired by Max Horkheimer, who helped found the Institute for Social Research (Frankfurt School) in 1923. Horkheimer developed “Critical Theory” with the goal of social emancipation, and along with Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse (who coined the phrase “make love, not war”) at the Frankfurt School promoted Cultural Marxism. They came to New York City and were loosely affiliated with Columbia University (where John Dewey was) from 1934-1943. “Critical Theory” criticized the traditional values of the cultural institutions in Western capitalist countries. In 1941 Edward Glaser authored An Experiment in the Development of Critical Thinking , and The Order was able to use “critical thinking” to foment the “generation gap” in the 1960s. As an educational tool, “critical thinking” was used to cause students to criticize the traditional values of their parents, clergy, and other authority figures. Relevant to the area of music, Theodor Adorno of the Frankfurt School described how fractious (e.g., rock) music could be used to undermine the traditional values of an existing culture. Paul Cantor of “The Jefferson Airplane” was reported as saying, “The new rock music is intended to broaden the generation gap, alienate parents from their children, and prepare young people for revolution.” Similarly, David Crosby (of “Crosby, Stills, and Nash”) said in Rolling Stone (vol. 1): “I figured the only thing to do was to steal their kids.... I’m just talking about changing young people’s value systems which"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"removes them from their parents’ world effectively.” In education, “forced busing” destroyed the concept of “neighborhood schools” for many, and greatly reduced the ability of parents to be involved in their children’s education. Proponents of “forced busing” relied much upon the research of James Coleman, who wrote in The Adolescent Society (1961, research funded by the U.S. Department of Education and the Ford Foundation): “The adolescent lives more and more in a society of his own; he finds the family a less and less satisfying psychological home.... Even if a strategy (to bring the adolescents back into the home) were extremely successful, it would have serious disadvantages.... Equality of opportunity, which becomes ever greater with the weakening of family power, would hardly be possible.” With “forced busing” (which increases the separation of parents from their children) in place to facilitate “equality of opportunity,” it was fairly easy for The Order to reduce parents’ role in the education of their children even further to the status of being simply one of many “partners.” Students, along with the adult population, had come to be considered by The Order as merely its own “human resources,” or “human capital,” or “humanware.” Once education had been nationalized in all of the countries of the world, it was not difficult for The Order to promote international standards in education as necessary if students were to be prepared to become workers in a global economy. Thus, education became internationalized, and schools everywhere were enlarged to become community service centers, providing not only education but also health care and other social services (e.g., contraceptives, abortion pills, etc). Population control was also maintained by The Order’s placement of fertility control agents in the water supply of certain selected communities where labor-serf housing was assigned. [Note: I have written many times about the Power Elite’s (PE’s) plan to link regional economic arrangements into a global economy managed by a World Socialist Government. In that regard, on January 27 the “Union for the Mediterranean” (formerly the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership) will come into being. It will include Israel as well as non-democratic Arab nations such as Jordan from which the Union’s Secretary- General Ahmad Khalaf Masadeh comes. And it will include economics, financial, social, cultural and human partnerships. Regarding Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol , ask yourself why it omitted reference to the embedded swastikas on The House of the Temple in Washington, D.C .."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Also, ask yourself why Dan Brown didn’t emphasize that leading Masonic philosopher Manly P. Hall said “the seething energies of Lucifer are in his [the Mason’s] hands.” Hall’s books can be found in Masonic libraries around the world, as can Morals and Dogma by Albert Pike who revised the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Pike in this book also praised Lucifer, as he likewise did in his Indo-Aryan Deities and Worship (remember there’s a connection between the Aryans and swastikas). In addition, Freemasons often say they seek “more light,” and Pike said Lucifer is the “Light-Bearer.” Most Masons are unaware of its true intentions or meanings of its terms, as Pike in Morals and Dogma revealed that those in the blue (lower) degrees are “intentionally misled.”] Of course, there were periods when The Order’s absolute rule was lessened, even allowing small revolutions to occur, so that potential adversaries to The Order could be"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"drawn out, identified, and dealt with before they could become too great in number. Bertram Gross had explained in Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America (1980) how computerized information could be used for “direct character assassination and defamation.... The creative assembly of unrelated sounds is now possible through electronic means.... Through ‘tape-recording,’ a person’s own voice may be used to say anything that the tape recorders want him to say.” Gross also had described how this might be done in the editing of film and videotapes by “the use of new RAVE methods (Random Access Video Editing).” In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the primary opposition to The Order was from various patriot militia groups around the world. The Order wisely engaged in a plan to discredit these groups along with very religious people by branding them as extremists who want to impose their views on everyone else. It was not difficult to infiltrate these groups with agents of The Order, who engaged in such outlandish behavior that the public perception of the patriotic groups to which they belonged became negative. Conveniently, while media and press attention focused upon right-wing militia as a threat to the U.S. government, little notice was given to the International Socialist Organization’s (holding regular meetings at universities across the U.S.) promotion of “worker’s militia” and its statement that “The struggle for socialism is part of a worldwide struggle.... To achieve socialism, the most militant workers must be organized into a revolutionary socialist party.... Only mass struggles of the workers themselves can destroy the capitalist system.... Capitalism must be overthrown...” ( Socialist Worker , November 22, 1996). So that the people did not recognize and react against The Order’s growing power and control, use was made of various psychological techniques. For example, use was made of the work of Wundtian psychologist Kurt Lewin and Soviet psychologist Alexander Luria concerning the artificial disorganization of behavior to control human behavior via the creation of social chaos. Their work was followed by J.R. Rees’ “Tavistock Method” inducing and controlling stress in order to make people give up firmly held beliefs under “peer pressure.” Rees’ work was followed by the “social turbulence” theory of Tavistock senior staff member Fred Emery. Use of this theory by The Order was carried out by creating a series of emotional crises, which caused the people to reduce the tension by adaptation and eventually psychological retreat (similar to Pavlov’s “protective inhibition” response), accepting the will of The Order. “Psychologically controlled environments” (Rees’ term) were created to manipulate particular populations via mass media. Relevant to this, villains in films did things so horrible that anything “anti-hero” heroes did to them, the audience would accept it. Modifying this technique, whenever the public began to become suspicious of The Order’s growing power, they were flooded with fictional conspiratorial books, motion pictures and television programs showing life in the future to be so totally controlled and terrible under various “Big Brother” types that they became confused and unable to perceive what The Order was in reality doing gradually to control them. And what the Order was actually doing was viewed by the public as not so extreme when it was compared to the hideous portrayals of the future presented by The Order in these books,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"films and TV programs. Thus, the people were psychologically manipulated into non- resistance to The Order’s increasing power and control over their lives. The possibility of terrorism, such as the nearly 100 missing Russian nuclear devices capable of fitting into suitcases, plus actual terrorist attacks upon buildings, airplanes, trains, etc., were used by The Order to justify greater monitoring of the population’s activities along with the confiscation of all firearms. The basis for firearms confiscation was a February 20, 1997 U.S. Justice Department letter indicating the Clinton administration’s position that Americans had no 2nd Amendment Constitutional rights as individuals. Immediately after the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on the morning of September 11, 2001, ABC News/Washington Post that evening released poll results indicating at least two-thirds of those surveyed “would sacrifice some personal liberties in support of anti-terrorism efforts.” This willingness of the people to sacrifice liberties paved the way for passage of the Patriot Act and the Homeland Security Act, both of which infringed upon the people’s freedom. Precedent for monitoring people’s activities has already been accepted with the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China in 1995, where a “family dependency ratio” was suggested. This ratio would measure each family member’s production and consumption to see that it was in line with preserving “sustainable development.” The U.N. and World Bank then audited natural capital (natural resources), manufactured capital (anything built), human capital (a person’s work skills, etc.) and social capital (what people think). Mega-church pastor Rick Warren, who was mentored by Peter Drucker, was helpful in this regard, as he got all of the churches across the globe on board for this agenda, thereby neutralizing any remaining opposition. In public areas, video and audio monitors were placed on all streets and buildings; and in people’s homes, audio monitors were placed on all phones, and all televisions were adapted for 2-way viewing. The public was told that this was to make them secure from theft and assault. Because computer hackers had become so proficient, the public was advised that for their own good, all domestic (including bank transactions) and Internet computer communications would have to be monitored by The Order. All word- processing and E-mail programs, all web browsers, and all computer software contained components allowing The Order to monitor everyone’s communications and other activities without their knowledge. On October 1, 1997 the federal government of the United States began operating a directory of all people hired for any full-time or part-time job in the U.S. All employers were required every 3 months to report all employees’ wages, and the gigantic database also even included the amount of the individuals’ assets and debts. Then on the front page of the July 20, 1998 New York Times , reporter Sheryl Stolberg wrote: “As legislation that would protect patient privacy languishes in Congress, the Clinton Administration is quietly laying plans to assign every American a ‘unique health identifier,’ a computer code that could be used to create a national database that would track every citizen’s medical history from cradle to grave.” It was somewhat surprising to see how willing the people were to lose their right to privacy, their right to bear arms,"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"and their freedoms in exchange for the peace, stability and security provided by The Order. Late in the previous century, The Order’s National Security Agency even developed the ability to monitor individuals’ electromagnetic emissions from their brains using remote neural identification and monitoring techniques, and then alter certain individuals’ brain waves (based upon capabilities of U.S. Patent 3,951,134, approved April 20, 1976) for their own good or, if necessary, to discredit those who were obstinate and resisted the beneficent work of The Order. Relevant earlier work included IBM’s 2020 neural chip implant, tested upon unsuspecting (sedated before implanting) Soledad prisoners, which provided a visual and audio record of all events in which they were involved, and which was used to reduce aggression, to make them lethargic, or to disable them. In 2025 C.E., this was supplemented by a computer chip (implanted behind the eye) developed by British Telecom’s artificial-life team headed by Dr. Chris Winter. This chip records a person’s every sensation, which can then be played back by a computer. The Order’s capabilities in this regard were an extension of what Zbigniew Brzezinski had written about the earlier Technozoic Era in his book, Between Two Ages (1970), in which he stated that “In the technetronic society the trends seem to be toward... effectively exploiting the latest communication techniques to manipulate emotions and control reason.... Human beings become increasingly manipulable and malleable... the increasing availability of biochemical means of human control... the possibility of extensive chemical mind control.... A national grid that will integrate existing electronic data banks is already being developed.... The projected world information grid....” The Technozoic Era was followed by the Ecozoic Era in which ecological and environmental concerns were used to persuade people that only a world government could solve the problems in these areas which transcend national borders. Very helpful in this regard were the early efforts of Mikhail Gorbachev, who became head of the International Green Cross, and remarked: “We are part of the Cosmos... Cosmos is my God. Nature is my God.... I believe that the 21st Century will be the century of the environment, the century when all of us will have to find an answer to how to harmonize relations between man and the rest of Nature.... We are part of Nature.... The future society will be a totally new civilization which will synthesize the experience of Socialism and Capitalism.” In the Ecozoic Era, the pledge of allegiance to the flag was replaced by the pledge of allegiance to the Earth. One of the pioneering efforts in this regard was Putnam School in Minneapolis, MN, in the early 1990s. This was followed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors on June 25, 2001 endorsing the Earth Charter, which has as a goal to “promote the equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations,” a clearly Socialistic concept. Also, The Order’s agents’ deliberate placement of endangered species on land desired by The Order was useful as a pretext for confiscating people’s property. At the beginning of this past century, the people had become anxious over the increasing chaos in the world, and they longed for peace, stability and security. Toward this end,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"health care, education, service and even the police of all nations had been nationalized and then internationalized, first under the authority of various U.N. agencies and then under The Order. U.N. treaties (e.g., on children’s rights) were enforced through domestic courts in the nations of the world. Military downsizing in nearly all of the nations forced a greater and greater reliance upon U.N. peacekeepers to quell disturbances and even to intervene in advance in countries where there might be trouble (e.g., racial discrimination in the U.S.). The people were already used to U.N. peacekeepers and foreign troops on their own soil, and these forces from other nations were used to put down domestic uprisings, even in the U.S. Eventually nations became borderless, and immigrants moved freely wherever they pleased, with The Order’s permission, of course. This resulted in a loss of what had been known as national cultures, and all countries came more and more to resemble each other, forming a New World Culture under the benevolent, guiding hand of The Order of the New World or New Civilization. Relevant to The Order’s establishment of a One-World culture, economy, government and religion, early Socialist August Comte had written in System of Positive Polity (vols. I to IV, 1851-1854) and The Catechism of Positive Religion (translated in 1858) about “the class whose special function it is to systematize man’s peaceful activity” and “a systematic domestic organization of public opinion, as they will stamp an unconstrained uniformity on all the salons of the globe, a process facilitated by the progressive acceleration of all means of communication.... Ultimately, political power will fall into the hands of the great leaders of industry.... The industrial chiefs are the representatives of Humanity.... The principle of all regular concentration of duty is this: A single manager for the whole field of industry which one man can personally direct. Thus temporal authority will be centered in a certain number of Families, scarcely one- thirtieth part of the entire population.... Man indeed, as an individual, cannot properly be said to exist.... Existence in the true sense can only be predicated of Humanity.... Now that Sociology is once for all substituted for Theology as the basis for the religious government of mankind.... Everywhere the relative definitively takes the place of the absolute.” With the people thus accepting moral relativism over Biblical moral absolutes, The Order was able via a series of crises to create a climate of desperation in which the people became willing to give ultimate power to the leader of The Order in the hope that their problems would be solved. For three and one-half years, The Order’s benevolent leader allowed the people to believe they had chosen wisely their ruler. However, for almost the last three and one-half years, The Order’s wonderful leader has ruled more forcefully for the public’s own good. Because the people began to see the leader as The Antichrist foretold in what they called The Holy Bible , The Order once again decided to assuage the public’s fears by creating their expected second coming of Jesus Christ. Late in the 20th century, the Intel Corporation had developed a supercomputer capable of performing more than 1 trillion calculations a second. This was described by Intel expert Justin Rattner as “a baby step toward being able to do a real simulation of the physical world,” where holographic scenes could not be easily distinguished from reality. After The Order significantly"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"improved upon this “baby step,” it holographically portrayed what many believed to be the second coming of Jesus Christ. (Note that Revelation 13 and 14 repeatedly refer to the “image of the beast,” the false Christ.) This helped fulfill in 2100 C.E. “the Plan” foretold by leading occultist Alice Bailey (whose first works were published by Lucifer Publishing) in her pamphlet “The Next Three Years (1934-1935-1936),” in which she described the “outer form” of the “World Federation of Nations... taking rapid shape by 2025.” She further remarked therein that one should “not infer by this that we shall have a perfected world religion and a complete community of nations..., but division and the idea will be universally recognized, universally desired, and generally worked for. When these conditions exist, nothing can stop the appearance of the ultimate physical form.... Approximately four-hundred men and women are working consciously with the Plan.” Further regarding The Order’s created perception of Jesus Christ’s second coming, late in the 20th century, the sound of a trumpet in midair without the use of a loudspeaker was generated by using American Technology Corporation’s Norris Acoustical Heterodyne Effect, acoustically mixing ultrasonic waves to create new waves that can be heard as sound in “midair.” (Note that Revelation 13:15 says that the image of the beast is given “life” and should “speak.”) The pyramid constructed to honor the accomplishments of The Order is now nearly complete as it reaches into the sky, higher than any other structure ever built by man. As I am concluding this paper describing the wonderful history of The Order’s rise to power, I am looking out of a window in the Ministry of Peace near the top of the commemorative pyramid and there is lightning in the sky from east to west. There is also a sound like a trumpet filling the air, and in the sky I see a figure of a Man coming....
