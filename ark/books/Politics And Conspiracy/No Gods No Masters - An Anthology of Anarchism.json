In 1870, while the imperial pleb iscite was in progre ss, one of Au guste Blanqui's youngest disci ples, Doctor Susini, had issued a pamph let entitled The More God, the More Master. In the twili ght years of his life (1805 -1881), during November 1880, Bla nqui himself launched a newspaper wh ich he endowed with the title Ni Dieu ni Maitre (Neither God nor Maste r) . After the great revol utionary's dea th, a number of grou ps and newspapers laid claim to the title. It was displayed on the walls of the Ma ison du Peuple in the Rue Ram ey in Par is . From then on it was the catch phrase of the anar chist FOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"movement , even if the latter 's inspiration was so very different from- not to say contrary to-Blanquism's. As we shall see in Volume II of this antholog y, Peter Kropotkin, in his Paroles d'un Revolte (1885) took the catch phrase fo r his very own, in the fol­ lowing terms: On his death-b ed, the man who, more than anybody else, was the embodi­ ment of this system of conspiracy, the man who paid with a life of imprisonment fo r his commitment to that system, uttered these words, which amount to an entire prog ram: Neither God nor Master! Af ter the bo mb out rage mounted by the anarc hist Auguste Vaillant against the Chamber of Deput ies on Dec ember 9, 1893, the bo urgeois authorities retali­ ated by pa ssing the so-c alled \"criminal\" laws in order to stamp out anarc hism. Fol lowing the debating of the bills , onlooker Alexandre Flandin shouted fr om the gallery in the Palais Bourbon: \"Anarchists strive to im plement the motto Neither God nor Master.\" In July 1896, the libertarians of Bordeaux issued a manif esto in which they eulogized \"the beauty of the libertarian ideal of Neither God nor Master.\" A little later, Sebastien Faure, writing in Le Libertalre of August 8-14 that year, declared: \"Blanq ui's catch-phr ase, Neither God nor Master, cannot be dis­ sected , but must be embra ced in its entirety .... \" During the 1914- 1918 war, Sebastien Faure revived the catch -phrase and, once peace had returned , th e Libertarian Youth fo unded in Paris adopted the name Ni Dieu ni Maitre, as Le Libertaire reported on June 25, 1919.

The text here offered is, in a sense , th e hefty dossier of evidence in a trial in defense of a reputat ion. Anar chism , in fa ct, has been victimized by undeser ved slurs-slurs that have come in three shapes. For a start, those wh o defame it contend that anarchism is dead . It is alleged not to have survived the great revol utionary ordeals of our times: the Russian Revo lution and the Spanish Revol ution , instead ofleaving it out of place in th is modern world characterized by centralization , large political and economic units and the totalitarian mind-set. As Victor Serge had it, anarchists had no op­ tion left but to \"switc h, under th e lash of events , to revolutionary marxism.\" 2 FOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Secondl y, its detr actors , the better to discr edit it, offe r a quite con tentious slant on its teac hings.

On two grounds: Firs t, the chrono logic al. In fa ct, Stirn er's ear liest libertarian writi ngs date from 184 2-1 844, which is to say, fr om a time when Proudhon was pub­ lishing his first anarchist scribb lings . So, fr om the point of view of chr onology, it really does not matt er which of that pair with which we open. If we have opted to open with Stirner, the rea son is that he stopped writi ng well bef ore Proudhon and because it would have been hard to situate Stirne r anywhere else in the anthology: Stirner being, in effect, a solitary rebel, a loner. Even in his cont emporary setting, he was a breed apart. He rehabilitated the individual in an age when, in the realms of philos ophy, Hegelian anti-in­ divi dualism was in the asce ndancy , and when in the rea lms of social criticism, the one-e yed app roach of bou rgeois egoism had led most reformers to pla ce the emphasis on its opposite . After all, is not the term soc ialism the opposite of individu alism? Hence the sound birc hing meted out to him, somewhat too seve rely, by Marx and Eng els. Stirner, stand ing fo ur-squ are against this societal appro ach, exalts the intr insic worth of the \"unique\" indivi dual-whic h is to say the indi vidu al nonpareil, destined by natur e to be one of a kind: this notion, be it said in passing, is endorsed by the latest disc overies of biology and also reflec ts the preo ccu pations of the contemporary wor ld, eage r to rescue the individu al fr om all sorts of oppressive alienati ons, the alienation implicit in industr ial slavery as well as that of tota litarian conf ormi sm. As Stirner told it, the indivi dual, in order to fr ee himse lf, must sort thr ough the baggage inhe rited fr om his fo reb ears and educators, and embark upon a comprehensive effort of \"de-sa cralizatio n.\" That effort has to begin with so- called bou rgeois moral ity. To that end, Stirn er mad e Pur itanism a special target . The apostles of secul arism had quite simply and plainl y tak en fo r their own eve rything that Chr istia nity \"has devised against pass ion.\" The y refuse to heed the calls of the flesh. He deplores secular ism's zeal against the flesh, its striking \"at the very essence of immortal ity.\" How scathing Stirner would have been about the secular morality of the Third Republic in France ! MAX STIRNER 9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Anticipating contemporary psychoanal ysis, our philmopher note, and denounces internalization. From childhood , moral prejudices have been in­ culcated into us. Morality has turned into \"an authority within , from which I have no escape.\" \"Its despotism is ten times worse now than once it was, fo r it mumbles in my consci ousne ss.\" \"The young are herded to school so as to learn the same old cant, and once they have comm ended to memory the prattle of their elders , they are pronounced adults.\" And Stirner becomes the iconoclast: \"God , conscien ce, duty, laws, all of them nonsense which they have packed into our heads and hearts.\" The real seducers and corrupters of the young ar e pries ts, teachers , and fathers who \"fill young hearts with figments and young heads with brutishnes s.\" Stirner is the fo re-runner of May 1968. Now , fr om time to time the spirit of his writing led him into certain paradoxes and drew asocial aphorisms from him, leading him to the concl u­ sion that life in society was impos sible. But these quite occas ional sorties do nothing to traduce the fu ndaments of his thinking. For all his hermit -like posturi ng, Stirner aspired to life in a commun ity. Like lost loners, cloistered persons and introverts , he craved companionship. Asked how his exclusivism might allow him to live in socie ty, he replied that only a man who has grasped his \"singularity\" can enter into relations with his fellows. The individual has need offriends and companionship: i( say, he writes books , he needs an audi­ ence. The individ ual joins fo rces with his fe llows in order to bolster his own power and in order to achie ve, through a pooling of resources , what each of them could never achieve on his own. \"If behind you there stand millions of others to prote ct you, together you represent a power to be reckoned with and success wi ll readil y be yours .\" On one condition , though : such relations with others must be voluntary and freely contracted , and revoc able at any time. Stirner draws a distinction between pre-established society , which is constricti ve, and associa tion which is a free action. He thereby prefigures the fe deralism of Proudh on, Bakunin and Kropotkin , as well as Lenin's right to secession. The author of The Ego and His OWl! is especia lly identified with contem­ porary concerns when he broaches the question of the party and specifi cally invokes the party of his Communist contem porari es. As we shall see, he is scathing in his criticism of the party's conformism. In his view, a monolith ic party is no longer an associa tion and has beco me a corpse instead. So he re­ jects any such party , though not, of course, the inclination to join a political associ ation: \"I can always fm d plenty of people willin g to assoc iate with me 10 MAX STIRNER"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"without having to pledge loyalty to my colors .\" He could not join a par ty, espec iall y if this involve d \"anything obligatory.\" The sole condition upon his eventual affi liation would be his not \"being swallowed up by the party.\" \"In any event, as he saw it, the party was me rely a party , onl y a part.\" \"The party is fr eely associated and acts upon its freedom similar ly.\" There is only one ingredient missing in Stirner's thinki ng, albeit it is that ack now led gment of it in some shape or form under lies his writings : he can­ not quite bring himself to accept that his \"egoism\" holds equall y true fo r the grou p. Onl y out of \"selfishness\" does he countenance associa tion with oth ers. The Stirnerian synthesis between the individual and soci ety rem ains wob­ bly. In the mind of this rebel, the asocial and the social are at odds with each other and never quite coal esce. Soci ally fo cused anarchists will repudiate him. All the more so as the misi nformed Stirner makes the mistake of including Proudhon among the \"authoritarian\" comm unists who would condemn the individ ualist aspiration in the name of some \"social duty.\" Now , while it is true that Proudhon was critical of Stirnerian \"worship\" of the individ ual, his entire output is a quest fo r a synthesis, or rather , a \"ba lanc e,\" between def ense of the indi vidual and the interests of socie ty, between individual power and collec tive power. \"Individ ualism is the elementary fa ct of humani ty,\" \"its vital princ iple,\" but \"assoc iation is its complem ent.\" The pages devo ted to Stirner which fo llow open with a review of his life, written by his French disci ple, E.

ARMAND MAX STIRNER Who , then, was this Max Stirner whose chief work , The Ego and His Own, has been such an unexpected success , having been published in edition after edition , translated , re-translated , and distributed , fu rnishing the matter fo r doctoral theses in philosoph y, fo r pamphlets and books and commentaries , and countless newsp aper and magazine articles in every one of the languages spoken by the civilized peoples of the world? The Ego and His Own (Dey Einzige und scin Eigentum) was issued in 1843, only to lapse into oblivion after attracting a fe w critical articl es. Then a German by the name of John -Henry Macka y Oohn -Henry's Scottish father passed away when his son was two years old: John-Henry was then educated by his mother and a step-f ather , both of them linguist ically and culturall y Germans ), who would later gain notoriety l himself, fo und his gaze drawn while studying in the British Museum in London in the summer of 1887, to Lange's tome on The History of Materialism, in which there were a fe w lines on Stirner and his book. Eventuall y he got hold of a copy of The Ego and His Own and read it through . So affected was he by the contents that he began to wonder about the man who had written it, about his origins , the course of his life, the circumstances in which he had lived and how he had met his end. He spared no effort in his researches , scouring the public libraries fo r any and all information about the man who so intrigued him, seeking out the offspring of those who had assoc iated with Stirner some half-century or fo rty years before, drawing them out, collecting their recolle ctions. He also contacted Stirner's secon d wife, Maria Danhardt. It was Trojan work, belie ve me. And what r am about to set out now are the findings of that dogged and protracted pursuit. Out of his researches came a voluminous tome of biography, Max Stirner, sein Leben und sein Werk (Max Stirner, Life and Work), the first edition of which appeared in 1897. It is my contention that book , regrettably not translated into French thus far, is of singular assistance in understanding The Ego and His Own. 12 MAX STIRNER"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"It will surprise no one that, fo r all his impartiality , Macka y depicted his hero in the kindliest of lights. Not unreasona bly, he regarded Stirner as the most daring and significant of think ers on that side of the Rhine, accounting hiln one of the successo rs of a Newton or a Darwin , rather than of a Bis­ marck, and as toweri ng above Nietz sche who was not, moreover , unfamiliar with Stirner.2 ( ... ) Macka y informs us that Max Stirner was merely a pen-nam e, a nom de guerre, and that his hero's real name was Johann Kaspar Schmidt and that he was born in Bayreuth on October 25, 1806. The name Stirner was simply a nicknam e given on account of his balding pate (in German Stirn). He held on to that nickname in The Ego ... and his other publicatio ns. We shall quickl y gloss over every thing that Mackay has to tell us about his education , his career as a free teacher , his nondescript first marriage which ended with the premature death of his wife, and move on to his dealings with the celebrated Berlin coterie of the \"The Free,\" and look at Macka y's revelations . They were a curious group, a club or coterie which met in the home of one Hippel, an innkeeper famed fo r the quality of his beverages , whose place was located on one of the busiest streets of the Berlin of his day. Without fo rmality or chairman , all sorts of criticisms were given an airing there and a mockery made of censo rship of any sort. The most heated arguments took place there amid the steam emanating from the great porcelain pipes with which anyone who has visited the breweries beyond the Rhin e will be fa­ miliar: conversations were held over a few glasses. All manner of folk were to be found rubbing shoulders there: there were the group 's regulars , sitting in the same position year after year, and there were the casual s, coming and going , popping back and dropp ing out of sight. To get the proper measur e of the story of this group- which was, to some extent , the incubator of The Ego . .. , we need to imm erse ourselves in the world of the German intellec tual between 1830 and 1850. Germ any was then turned upside down not just by criticism in matters theologic al-Stra uss's Life of jesus dates from this time- but also by the yearnings fo r political liberty that were to give rise to the German revol ution of 1848 . Among these \"Free\" the main and primary topics of discussion were poli­ tics, socialism (in the communist sense ), anti-Semi tism (which was beginning to make some headway), theology , and the notion of authori ty. Theologi ans like Bruno Bauer rubbed shoulders with liberal journali sts, poets , writer s, students delighted to get away from ex cathedra lectur es, and even with officers MAX STIRNER 13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"whose conversation extended to more than horsef lesh and women and who had the tact to leave their super cilious airs and swagger at the door. Ther e were also a few \"ladies\" around: Marx and Engels also frequented these circles, albeit brief ly. Bohemians and iconoclasts as they were , the \"Free\" did not always get a good press or enjoy good repute. It has been argued that there were veritable German- style orgies on Hippel's premises. One occasional visitor, Arnold Ruge , berated them one day: \"You want to be free men and you cannot even see the [clUl mire in which you wallo w. One does not free men and peoples with vulgarities (Schweinerein). Clean yours elves up before you embark upon any such undertaking.\" The \"Hippel's place gang\" was not always flush. One evening the inn-keeper refused to give them any more credit, and so they were fo rced-Bruno Bauer along with the rest-to pass the hat around in Unter den Linden. On one occas ion there was a generous outsider who sized up the situation and, being amused and intrig ued, coughed up enough money to restor e their credit at Hippel's establishment. Mackay tells us that Max Stirner was a regular at \"Free\" get-togethers fo r ten years . He would show up with his sardonic grin, a dream y, piercing gaze emanating from the blue eyes behind his wire-rimmed spectacles. Macka y paints him as having been cold, impassive, inscr utable , having no need to confide in anyone and keeping everyone at arm's length: even those \\vith whom he had every thing in common were vouchsaf ed no insight into his joys, his griefs, any of the minutiae of his everyda y life. To tell the truth. no one in the circle knew Stirner, not his close fr iends nor his sworn enemies . His character appears to have spared him passionate love or passionate hatred . Plain, manner ly, sober, virtu ally without needs or an y particular disposition beyond a preference fo r plainness, this is how Mackay portrays him in the eyes of those closest to him. Strong and self-contained. At the time when he married again in 1843, this time to Maria Danhardt, an affable, blond, well-to-d o sentimental dreamer from Mecklembur g, Max Stirner's star stood at its highest point. Indeed. within months, The Ego and Its Own would appear. The youthf ul Maria, who had a distinguished education which she had taken in her stride, was also an associate of the \"Free\" circle. She too was a connoisseur of cigars, smoked the long-stemmed pipe so beloved of students and readily downed old man Hippel's ales. But the marriag e was not a happy one. Macka y also had wind of the calumnies to which Stirner had been sub- 14 MAX STIRNER"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"jected. He had been accused ofliving off his wife. Macka y was keen to find what substance there may have been to the charge. He managed to track down Maria Danhardt in London, and fo und her profoundly religi ous, elder ly and embi ttered, but with a good enough memory to be able to tell him \"that it made her blood boil to think that a man of such erudition and education could have exploited the position of a poor woman like herself, and so abuse her trust as to dispose of her assets as he deemed fit.\" She went even furt her and insinuated th at this egoist of egoists had derived some curious sadistic thrill from introducing his wife to the \"Free\" to see her corrupted by the infection there and watch material and moral corruption at work. How much truth was there in all of this? Broadl y speaking, I go with Macka y's contention. Both of them-especi ally Stirner, wh o had always lived in a condition of impoveris hment -being poorly versed in financial matters , the likelihood is that the money slipped through the fingers of them both. Of course, the sensiti ve Maria Danhardt could not understand the deep th inker wh o had asked her to share his journey th rough life. And yet Stirner was not without sensibilit ies, but was first and fo remost a romantic . Within a short time of their wedding, they were \"co-habiting\" rather than living as husband and wife. A point came wh en sep aration became inevitable. It was reached in 1845. ( .. . ) Far from being slothful, Max Stirner had continued to produce. Neither his conjugal debts nor those he had incurred through publication of The Ego and His Own had dimin ished his mind' s fertility. And so he set abou t translating the nuster works of J.B. Say and Ada m Smith which saw publication in Leipzig in 1845-1847, eight volumes com plete with his own commentary and notes. 1852 saw the publication in Berlin of his two-volume History qfReaction. Also in 1852, we find his annotated translation ofJ.B. Say's pamphlet Capital and Interest, published in Hamburg. Thereaf ter, no more mention of him. Macka y shows him to us ground down by poverty, flitting from lodgings to lodgi ngs, all of them tracked down by Stirner's indefatigable biograph er. He dropp ed out of sight, mixing with no one and shunning his old friends. Coping da y by day as best he could, he continued to profess to be a journalist, teacher, doctor of ph ilosophy, and even rentier , althoug h in point of fact he was a courier, a messe nger.

Thus the ultimate object of educat ion can scarcely be knowledge any more : it is, rather, the will born of such knowledge. In short, its tendency will be to create the personal or free man. Wha t is truth but the revelat ion of what we are? It is a matter of our discovering ourse lves, of freeing ourse lves from everyth ing extraneous to us, of refraini ng ourse lves or releas ing ourse lves radically from all author ity, of a return to innocence. But school ing does not produce such absolutely true men. And if there be a school that does, it is in spite of school ing. The latter no doubt affords us mastery over th ings, and, strictly speak ing, also affords us mastery of our own nature. But it does not make free natures of us. In fact, no know ledge , no matter how profound and comprehens ive it may be, no alert, wise mind and no dialectical finesse can arm us against the snares of thought and will. ( ... ) All sorts of vanity and desire fo r profit, ambition, slavish enthus iasm and dupli city, etc., are highly compat ible with immense learn ing, as they also are wi th an elegant classical educa tion. And this whole scholar ly farrago , which docs not impinge upon our moral behavior, is frequently fo rgotten by us, espec ially as it is useless to us: we shake off the dust of the school whenever we leave it. How come? Beca use educat ion consists exclus ively of the fo rmal or the mater ial, or at best of a blend of the two, but not of truth, not of the mold ing of the true man. ( . . . ) Like some other fields , the field of pedagogy too is numbered among those where the point is that freedom should not be allowed access, and opposi­ tion not tolerated: what is sought is subm issiveness.

Does th is amount to abandoning culture? No, nor to sacrif icing freedom of thought , but rather to transf iguration of it into freedom of the will. On th e day wh en man regards it as a point of honor that he sh ould be alive to or cognizant of self, acting fo r himself with complete autonom y, with fu ll self-consciousne ss, and complete freedom , th at day he will no longer be fo r himself a curious , inscrutable object and will begin to banish th e ignorance that hobbles and thwart s his fu ll self-knowledge .

It is the orderi ng of that mutual dependency . Should the king, who , from the top down, conf ers authority upon everyon e, even upon the executioner's assistant, perish, order would nonetheless be maintained in the fa ce of the disorder of bestial instin cts, by all who have a sense of order well-anchored in their consc iousn esses.

And so all is fo r the best in the best of all pos sible orders , but that ideal order is the State. Our societies and our States exist without our having fa shioned them: they are put together without our consent: they are pre-ord ained, having an independent and indiss oluble life of their own , being against us individual­ ists.

Even without my interven tion, a State exists . I am born into it, raised within it and I have my obligations to it, I owe it \"loyalty and homage .\" It takes me under its sheltering wing and I live by its grace.

Our existence opens with the closest of unions, since, even before we draw our fIrst breath, we share our mother's existence: then, when we open our eyes to the light, 'oNe find ourselves at the breast of a human being: her love cradles us, keeps a check upon us and binds us to herself by a thousand ties. Society is our natural state. Which is why, as we come to self-awareness, the union that had at first been so intimate grows increasing ly looser and the disinteg ration of primiti ve society becomes more and more manif est. If the mother wants to have again, all to herself , the child that but la tely was nestling beneath her heart, she has to fe tch him from the street and wrest him from the compan y of his playmate s. For the child prefers the company of his peers over the society which he did not enter of his own voliti on, but into which he merely happ ened to have been born . ( ... ) Once an assoc iation has crysta llized in society, it has ceased to be an association, since assoc iation is an ongoing act of re-as sociation. It has become an assoc iation in an arrested state , it has frozen. It is no more as fa r as assoc iation is concerned, being now merely the corpse of an association: in short, it has become society, commun ity. The [political] party offers us an eloquent instance of this pr ocess. 22 MAX STIRNER"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"For a soc iety , the State for ins tance, to gnaw away at my freedom is a mat­ ter of small conseq uence to me.

Even so, were I the autocrat of all the Russias, I could not enjoy absolute freedom. But, as far as my ind ividuality goes, I do not want anyone tampering with it. Now, it is precise ly individual­ ity that society targets and means to sub ject to its power. A socie ty to wh ich I affil iate certainl y strips me of a few freedoms but it affords me other freedom s in com pensation. It matters little, too, whether I den y my self such and such a freedom (through some contract, say) . On the othn han d, I will stand guard jea lou sly over my individuality. According to the extent of its power , every community more or less tends to set itse lf up as an authority over its members and to restrict their freedom of movem ent. It requires of them, and is obliged to require of them, the limited conscience suited to sub ject s: it wants them sub jected and onl y exists inso far as they are in sub jection. Not that that precludes a certain toler ance: on the contra ry, socie ty will give a ready welcome to improvement schemes, reprimands, and repro aches, just as long as they are of benefit to it: but the criticism that it ac­ cepts has to be \"frien dly. \" It must not be \"inso lent and lacking in rever ence.\" In short , there must be no trespass against the substance of the soc iety , which must be regarded as sacr osanct. Society requires that no one should rise above it, that one should stay within the \"bo unds of the law,\" that is, that onl y what is permitted by the soci ety and its laws be allow ed. There is a difference between a societ y that curtails my fr eedom and a soc iety that curtails my individual ity. In the first case, there is union, agre ement, asso­ ciation . But if my individuality is jeo pardized, then it is because it is confronted by a soci ety wh ich is a power in itself , a power higher than the Ego, one that is inacces sible to me, one that I may well admir e, adore, venerate and respect , but which I may never tame nor use, for the good reason that in its presence I make renunciation and abdication .

No associa tion could be launched, nor coul d one exist in the absence of certain lim itations upon free dom, just as a State is not com pati ble with boundless freedom.

Where in dividu ality is conce rned, the difference between State and as­ sociation is considerable: the fo rmer being its fo e, its murderer , and the latter its daughter and auxili ary. One is a spirit that demands our adoration in spirit and in truth: the other is my handi work, my creation. The State is the master of my spirit: it demands my fealty and fo rces an article of fa ith, the creed of legality , down my throat. It wields over me a moral influence , commanding my spirit, dispossessing me of my Ego so as to supplant it as my real self In short , the State is sacred and, set alongside me, the individual, it is the authentic man, the spirit, the spook. Associa tion, by contrast , is my own doing , my creature . It is not sacred. It does not impose itself as a spiritual power superior to my spirit. I have no wish to become a slave to my maxims , but would rather subject them to my ongoing criticism. I afford them no citizenshi p rights within myself. Much less do I wish to commit my entir e fu ture to the associa tion, to \"sell it my soul,\" as the Devil would have it, and as is truly the case when the State or any other spiritual authority is involve d.

I am told that I must be a man in the company of my peers (Marx, The Jewish Question, page 60). I ought to respect them as my peers. As fa r as I am concerned , no one is deserving of respect , not even my peer. He, like others, is merely an object in which I take or fail to take an interest , a servicea ble or unservicea ble sub ject.

In the second 1845 issue oj the same reFiew, Feuerbach had pub lished , anollymously, all essay entitlcd \"Regardin g THE ESSENCE Of CHRISTIANITY ill relation to THE EGO AND H IS OWN.\" Stirner next replied to Moses Hess, who had attacked him in a little 28-page pamphlet published in Darmstadt in 1845 as THE LAST PHILOSOPHERS. The second portion oj this Coullter-Criticism was published under the NOM DE PLUME oj G. Edward in the Jo urth 1847 issue of Otto W(�(md's reFiew THE EPIGIONES as \"The reactionary philosophers. A reply to Kuno Fischer's The Modern Sophists, \" wherein, again in the third person, Stirner replied to a criticism Jrom KUlla Fisc/lcr, which had appeared ill 1847 as \"The Modern Sophists, \" in the LEIPZIGER REVUE and which was esselltially directed agaillst him. To day's reader will doubtless be interested, Ilot so much in the argument s and quibbl es oj a Stimer grapp ling with his adversaries as in the way in which he draws a distinction between his own individl/a list \"1:r;oism \" and vulgar �r;oism, and the manner in which he recollciles his individualism with the spirit of associa tion. WHAT IS STIRNERITE EGOISM? A certain notion of egoism, whereby it is taken simply to mean \"isolation, \" has gained currency . But wh at can egoism have to do with isolation? Do I (Ego) become an egoist if say, I shun men's comp anionshi p? I isolate my self and live alone of course, but that does not make me any more of an egoist than the rest who continue to coexist with men and revel in it. IfI isolate my self , it is beca use I no longer delight in society; ifI remain within it, it is because men still have much to offe r me. Remaining in their com pany is every wh it as egotistical as isolating my self fr om them. When it comes to competiti on, to be sure, everyone is on his own. But should competition some day disa ppear, beca use concerted effort will have been ack now ledged as more beneficial than isolation, then will not every sing le indi­ vidual inside the associa tions be equal ly egoistic and out fo r his own interests? The coun ter to that is that it will, though, not be at his neighbor's expense now, MAX STIRNER 31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"but rather fo r the good reason that the neighbor will no longer be so fo olish as to let anybody else be a parasite upon him. And yet it is said: \"The man who thinks only of himself is an egoist.\" But that would be a man who does not know and cann ot appre ciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others , from the consid eration shown to others . That would be a man beref t of innumerable pleasur es, a wretched character. Why then should that runt, that loner be declared to be more egotistical than richer natures? Is the oyster more of an egoist than the dog, the Black more of an egoist than the German, the poor, despisedJewish second-hand clothes dealer more of an egoist than the enthusiastic socialist? And the vandal destr oyer of works of art that leave him cold, is he more of an egoist than the painstaking connoisseur who treats them with the utmost care, because he has an interest in and taste fo r them? And if there should be someon e-we shall pass over the question of whether there is any evidence for the existence of anything of the sort-who takes no \"human\" interest in men, who cannot appreciate them as men, would he not be a wretched egoist, rather than a genuine Egoist? ( ... ) The person who loves a human being is, by virtue of that love, a wealthier man than someone else who loves no one: but what we have here is not a contrast between egoism and non-ego ism. fo r both these human types are merely obedient, each after its fa shion, to their respec tive inter ests. \"Even so, everyone ought to take an interest in peo ple and should love people!\" Well now, let us see where that duty, that commandment to love has got usl For the past two thousand years , men's hearts have been stutfed with it, and yet the socialists are comp laining today that our proletarians are treated with less consi deration than slaves in Ancient times, and yet those same socialists once again are peddling, albeit with much greater stridency, that comman dment to love. You want men to display an interest in you? Well then, make it an obliga­ tion upon them to fe el some fo r you, and stop being unin teresting saints who wear their blessed humanity like a sacred garment and clamor like beggars: \"Respect our human natur e, fo r it is sacred !\" The Egoism fo r which Stirner acts as spokesman is not the contrary of love, nor of thou ghtfulness, and is not inimical to a sweet life oflove, nor to commitment and sacrifice: it is not hostile to the tenderest of cordiali ty. nor is it the enem y of criticism, nor of socialism: in short, it is not inim ical to any interest: it excludes no interest. It simply runs counter to un-interest and 32 MAX STIRNER"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"to the unin teresting: it is not against love but against sacred love, not against thinking, but against sacred thinking: not against socialists , but against the sacred socialists, etc. The \"exclu sivism \" of the authentic Egoist, which some would represent as \"isolation\" or \"detachm ent\" is instead a full partici pation in whatever arouses interest, to the exclusion of whatever does not. There has been a refusal to give due credit to Stirner for the most signifi­ cant chapter of Stirner's book2, the chapter on \"M y Intercourse ,\" intercourse with the world and the associa tion of Egois ts. MOSES HESS AND THE TWO SORTS OF EGOISTS' ASSOC IATIONS ( ... ) Hess contends that \"our entire history has thus fa r been nothing but the his tory of egoist associa tions , the fruits of which, the slavery of Antiq­ uity, Roman serf dom and modern, axiomatic, uni versal servitude, are all too fa miliar to us all.\" For a start, Hess here uses ( ... ) the expression \"ego­ ist assoc iation\" rather than Stirner's term \"Egoists' associ ation .\" His readers ( ... ) will assur edly not be long in finding it accur ate and indubitable that the associa tions to which he refers were indeed \"egoist assoc iatio ns.\" But is an assoc iation, wherein most memb ers allow themse lves to be lulled as regards their most natural and most obvious interes ts, actu ally an Egoists' assoc iation? Can they reall y be \"Egoi sts\" who have banded together when one is a slave or a serf of the other? No doubt there are egoists in such a societ y, and on that basis it could with some semblance of justifi cation be described as an \"egoist associa tion\" but, my word! the slaves did not seek out such company out of egoism, and are, rather, in their egoist heart of hearts, against these splendid \"associa tions ,\" as Hess describes them. Societies wherein the needs of some are satisfied at the exp ense of the rest, where , say, some may sati sfy their need for rest thanks to the fa ct that the rest mu st work to the poin t of exhausti on, and can lead a life of ease because others live in misery and perish of hunger, or indeed who live a life of dissipation beca use others are foolish enough to live in indigenc e, etc ., such societies are described by Hess as \"egoist associa tions\" and he ventures quite can didly and intoler ably to take these \"egoist assoc iations\" of his as synon ymous with Stirner's \"Eg oists' associations.\" Tr ue, Stirner does happen to use the expression \"egoist associa tion\" too, but that expre ssion is, for one thing, spelled out as an \"Egoists' associa tion ,\" and, fo r another, is appro priate, whereas what Hess calls MAX STIRNER 33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"by that name is more of a religious soc iety, a communion held as sacrosanct by right, by law and by all of the pomp and circumstance of the cour ts. Th ings would be different had Hess agreed to look at egoist associ ations in real life and not just on paper. Faust was in the midst of such associa tions when he cried out: \"H ere I am a man, here I can be one ( . . . )\" Go ethe spells it out fo r us in black and wh ite. Had Hess paid close attention to real life, to which he is said to adhe re so clos ely, he might see hundre ds of egoist associa tions of that sort, some ephemer al, some enduring. Even at this very moment there may be some chi ldren gathered outside his window and becoming pla ymates: let him obse rve them then , and he will spot joyful egoist associa tions. Ma vbe Hess has a fr iend , a belov ed: in wh ich case, he may know how the heart has its reasons, how two beings come toget her egoist icall y in enjoyment of each other, neithe r of them the reby \"losing out.\" It may be that he comes across good pals in the street who invite him to acco mpan y them to a cafe: does he takc up this invitation so as to do them a kind serv ice, or does he go along with thcm because it holds out the pro spect of pleasur e to him? Should they thank him warmly fo r his \"sacr ifice,\" or do they appre ciate that, tog ethe r, they all make up, fo r an hour or so, an \"egoist assoc iation? \" FEUERBACH'S ABSTRACT \"MAN\" ( .. . ) Feuerb ach fo rgets that \"man \" does not exist, that he is an arbitrary abstr action and he sets him up as an ideal . Is it any wonder that in the final analysis he turns him into a generic , my sterious, impe rsonal being endowed with sec ret \"pow ers\" wh ich, like the Greek gods alongside Zeus, conf er a polythei stic fu nction upon him' ( ... ) Stirner cou nters this watch wo rd, this phraseology of \"humanism,\" with that of \"Eg oism.\" Wh at?

Does that amount to saying that Sti rner, with his \"Egoism,\" is seeking to den y every thing that belongs to us all, to declare it non- existent, that, out of negation pure and sim ple, he wants to make a tabula rasa of all private prop ­ erty in our social organization, which none may escape? Does it mean that he wishes to turn his back on all human com mun ity, to turn into a chrys alis, wh ich would be tantam ount, so to speak, to committing suicide?

( ... ) Stirner himse lf has descri bed his book as a sometimes \"clumsy\" articula tion of what he intended to say. It is the laborious product of the best years of his life: and yet he agrees that it is, to some extent, \"clum sy,\" insof ar as he is grap pling with a language corrupted by the phil oso phers, debauched by the henchmen of the Sta te, of religion and of other belie fs, a language that has been turned into a generator of an unf athoma ble mishmash of ideas.

The solution to the poverty problem thus consists of taking the book ­ keeper's expertise to fresh heigh ts, setting down the entries fo r societ y, re­ cording the credits and debits of each institution, with the general accounts or divisions in the social ledger being, not the terms of or dinary accountancy such as capital, funds, general merch andise, orders and deliveries, etc., but those of the philoso phy oflegislation and politi cs, like competition and monop oly, property and commun ity, citizen and State, man and God, etc. Finall y, and to round off my analo gy, the entries must be kept up-to-date, that is to say, there must be a precise recording of rights and duties, so that at any given moment one can gauge the scale of order and disorder and a balance be arrived at.

As he was later to admit, the approach of the republic struck terror into him. The advent of it first \"dum bfound ed\" him and he prematu rely wore \"mourning fo r the republic and carried the bur den of the calumnies about to strike socialism.\" However, he very quickly recovered and welcomed the revol ution .

That revol ution, which was about to erupt in the political order, was the birth date of a social revolution that was in no one's voca bul ary.\" No one, that is, except Proudhon. Since 1846, he had had a very settled idea of it. It fe ll to him to launch a \"crucial revol ution\" an \"economic revolut ion .\" He had his own \"so lution to the social que stion.\" In the fo rm of the mut ual associa tion, what we toda y would desc ribe as self-management . \"I am the Revol ution ,\" he noted proudl y in his earne ts. The panacea he prop osed was a cur ious blend of realism and utopia. Realism when he called fo r a prolif eration of workers' production assoc iations as the only way of side-stepping capi talism and Statist nationalization alike. Utopi a, when he deluded himse lf that his system would spread like an oil stain and wind up progressi vely taking over the whole of industry, without violent expropriation, thanks to interest-free loans granted to workers' associa tions by a \"Pe ople's Bank,\" a sort of mu tual fu nd operating outside of the orbit of any State contr ol. But politics snatched Proudhon away fr om his panaceas . Def eated at first in the April elections, he was returned as a deputy in the fo llow-up election s on June 4-5, 1848, by some 77, 000 vot es. A fe w weeks earlier he had been thunderi ng: \"U niversal suf frage is counter -revolu tion .\" As will be seen anon, he was to concede now that: \"When I think of eve rything that I have put down on paper and published over the past ten years regar ding the State' s role in socie ty, bringing the auth orities under con trol and the revolut ionary incapacity of govern ment , I am tempted to think that my electi on on June 1848 was the result of incomprehension on the part of the people.\" A fo rtnight later, the workers fr om the fa ubour gs rose up to register their protest at the closure of the \"national wor kshop s,\" a sort of work scheme that PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON 59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"had been devised fo r the purpose of reducing unemplo yment. But Proudhon had taken his parliamentary calling too seriously: \"As fo r me, the memory of the June events will fo rever be a burden of guilt upon my heart .... Out of parliamentary cretinism, I fa iled in my duty as a repre sentative. I was there to see and saw not: to raise the alarm and did not cry out'\" But whenever the distur bances in the Faubo urg Saint-An toine were crushed savag ely by General Cavaignac' s' troops, Proudhon took to the streets . He went to the Place de la Basti lle. To a question er, he replied: \"I am listening fo r the sublime hour of cann on fi re.\" While a terror-st ricken bour geoisie screamed hystericall y, he insisted that the rebels be not slandered . He eulogized the un­ selfishness and lofty morality of the working classes. \"The combatants ofJune ( ... ) they used you ill who, in the name of the authori ties, made you a promi se that the authorities were powerle ss to keep.\" After the June events, Proudhon was no longer quite the same man. He spoke a class language, aggressi vely proclaiming his socialism. From mid-July on, he was up to his neck in the fray. He mounted the parliamentary rostrum to turn it into an instrument of social strug gle. \"Wh ether it was hubris or lightheadedne ss,\" he was to write, \"I reckoned that my time had come. It was up to me, I told myself, to th row myself into the whirlwind. From my seat in the audien ce, I hurled myself-a new actor -into the drama.\" He tabled a bill which was designed simultaneous ly to hit the rich and exonerate the poor: a one third levy upon all income, with a one-th ird discount on all rents or fa rm dues. The suggestion provoked widespread scand al. On the finan ce commis­ sion, \"Monsieur\" Thiers , the spokesman fo r the bour geoisi e, cut lumps out of Proudh on. OnJuly 31, Proudhon expla ined himselfin a great speech delivered before the assem bly. Exasp erated by interruptions and insults, he turned provo­ cateur. He \"questione d\" the \"propriety of proceeding with social liquidatio n,\" only to add: \"In the event of refusal, we would proceed with the liquidation without you.\" (Violent grumb ling). And, by way of reply to his interru pters , he added also: \"When I say 'we,' I identif y myself with the proletariat, and when I say 'you,' I am identif ying you with the bourg eois class.\" A deputy cried out; \"That's social warfare'\" The speech closed with what were adjudged these inflammatory words: \"Capital will not be making a comeback. Society is wise to it.\" Proudhon \\vas t o COll1ment: \"Which meant: the social question has been posed and you will resolve it or you \\vill not have an end of it.\" \"It was no longer I who was speaking fr om the rostru m, it was all toilers !\" 60 PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The scandal created by this parliamentary outburst was tremendous and Proudhon 's bill was rejected virtu ally unan imously by 69 1 votes to 2, the latter being Proudhon and a certain Grepp o. Proudhon was to deliver this forceful comment: \"From July 31 fo rward, I became, to borrow the expres­ sion of one journalist, the boge yman. ( ... ) I have been preached at, toyed with, eulog ized, placarded, had my life story rehearsed, been caricatured, condemned, insulted, cursed. ( ... ) In anonymous letters, the bigots have threatened me with the wrath of God: pious women have sent me blessed medals . ( ... ) Petitions have been fo rwarded to the National Assem bly, asking that I be expelled as unfit.\" The by-elections of September 17, 1848 provided Proudhon with a fu r­ ther opportunity to espouse a clear- cut revolu tionary stanc e. Swallo wing his repugnance vis-i -vis universal suffrage yet again, he gave his endorsement through his newspaper to the candidacy ofFranvois- Vincent Raspail. A scien­ tist renowned fo r his work in the fields of botan y and organic chemi stry, and a specialist in the medical uses of camphor, Raspail (1794-1 878) had earned a reputation as \"doctor to the poor\" and in 1846 had been prosecuted for practicing medicine unlawfully. On February 24, 1848, he had been one of the first to march on the city hall and proclaim the Republic there. Later , he had declined all public office and gone on to launch a newspap er in which he was scathingly critical of the provisional government. Alongside Auguste Blanq ui, he had been one of the leading lights behind the mighty demonstration by the popular clubs which had stormed into the Palais Bourbon on May 15, declaring the assembly dissolved and installing a short-lived insur gent government in the city hall. That same evening, along with Barbes and a handf ul of others, Raspail had been arrested and committed to the Vincennes fortress. Conseq uently, it was as a prisoner that he offered himself to the electors of the Seine department in the partial elections. Raspail romped to victory. \"Socialism,\" Proudhon was to relate , \"made the elections of September 17. Even as every thing stood ready to crush him, 70,000 men answered his call by way of protesting against the June victors, and appointed Raspail to represent them. The democratic election committee held its meetings in the offices of Le Peuple . In the face of an extreme backlash, the democracy adopted its most vigorous mouth piece as its flagship. ( .. . ) The issue was no longer a choice between monarch y and demo cracy , but rather between labor and capital.\" Within a fe w weeks , at a banquet, Proudhon prop osed a resounding \"toast to the Revolut ion.\" He resolutel y added the adjective \"socia list\" to that of PIERRE- JOSEPH PROUD HON 61"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"\"democratic,\" arguing that from now on there was no way of \"disentangling the Republic from socialism.\" \"Only the people, shifting for itself, without intermediaries, can carry through the economic Revolution launched in February.\" But the June revolt and the horrific repression of it had not just radical­ ized the vanguard: it had also, to a much greater extent, given a fillip to the counter-revolu tion. Except in the Seine department, the by-elections had favored the conservatives and a newcomer, Prince Louis Bonaparte, nephew of the great Napoleon, who successfully had himself returned by 300,000 votes across five departmen ts. Whereupon he put himself forward as a candidate in the presidential elections of December 10. Proudhon once again urged Raspail to run in those elections.2 At first, his newspaper had urged abstention, before urging that votes be spoiled by way of protest. By then, Louis Bonaparte, Ge neral Cavaignac (the butcher from June) and the bourgeois democrat Ledru-Rol lin had already declared their intentions to run. What good would it do for Raspail to run? Proudhon was to explain: \"Raspail's candidature was specific ally prompted by Ledru-Rollin's.\" By voting for Ledru-Ro llin, the democracy \"was coming out in support of the governmental thesis and was no longer socialist. ( ... ) The honor of its future opposition required that it register its protest.\" In the tide of reaction that sw ep t the pro vinces of France, especiall y in rural areas, Ledru-Rollin's candidature stood no chance. But, as Proudhon explains, even ifit \"stood no chance of success and it were up to us to contrive its failure, we should have done so.\" Raspail's candidacy was a gesture of defiance towards the bourgeois democrats who had proven themselves bankrupt in their exercise of power since the February revolution. In the end, it was the Prince who carried the day, by a huge majority. Proudhon had this to say about this stunning result: \"france has appointed Louis Bonaparte president of the Republic, because it is weary of parties, because all of the parties are moribund.\" And he went on to explain that the righteous horror inspired by General Cavaignac had, in any case, \"herded most democr ats in the direction of Napoleon.\" The Revolu tion had given up the ghost. The incoming regime wasted no time before throwing Proudhon into pris­ on. As a result of which he had plenty of time to probe and draw the lessons of the revolution's failure. This was his chance in 1848, if not to venture quite so far as anarchy \"which, like any other principle, is more indicati ve of an ideal than of 62 PIER RE-JO SEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"a reality,\" then at least to attack State centr alization. Citizens had to be \"en joined to reco ver poss ession of thems elves.\" \"De partments and comm unes [had to recover l control of their affairs, control of policing, the disposition off unding and of their troo ps.\" Unless these minim um requirements were met, \"all talk of revol ution was hypocris y.\" But the men of 1848 \"held back as they were by the general pre judice and that fe ar of the unknown that stalks the greatest minds, lacked daring.\" \"The political question was devolved ... upon the National Ass em­ bly : whereup on it was fo reseea ble that it would be buried there. There, the understanding was that the peo ple , being a minor, could sca rce ly be trusted to its own counsel: gove rnmentalism was uphe ld with increased vigor.\" \"The flaw, the very great flaw of the gove rnm ent ( ... ) resides in its fa ilure to demo lish. Power has to be disarmed,\" its \"nails and teeth dra wn,\" \"half of the army let go, and troops banished fr om the capital .\" Instead of whi ch, the government raised twent y-f our battalions of the National Mobile Guard, made up of vol unteers . \"What then did it intend to do with all these soldiers? June was to teach us the answer to that.\" Proudhon had arrived at the fo llow ing libertarian concl usions fr om his scru­ tiny of the historical preced ent of 1793: \"C lubs had to be org anized. The orga­ nization of popular soci eties was the fu lcrum of democ racy , the corner-stone of the repub lican order.\" \"If there was one insti tution that democratic authorities should have respected, and not just resp ected but also fo stered and org anized, it was the clu bs.\" \"Ever ything was done the wrong way round in February ( ... ) Instead of restoring to the people its fertility of initiative by subordin at­ ing the authorities to its wish es, an attempt was made to resolve , fr om posi­ tions of authority, matters on which time had not [enlightened ] the masses .\" \"The pro visional gove rnment, having none of the genius of revolu tions ( ... ) wasted days and weeks on poin tless trial and error, agitations and circul ars.\" \"D riven by the breath of opinion, it strove to latch on to some initiative . A dismal venture !\" Aside fr om the odd positive measure, \"every thing else was me rely fa rce, bluster, nonsense and flying in the fa ce of common sense. We could say that power has a stultif ying effect on men of intellect. And Proudhon gave a sound thrashing to those who , like the members of the Popular Front gove rnment of 1936, had but one thought in their heads: keeping within the bounds of the law. \"The whole of their ambition ( ... ) has been to render a true accoun ting like good stewar ds. Ha unted by the memory of '93 ( ... ) not wishing to be tak en fo r wre ckers , nor to usurp the nati on's sovereignty, PIERRE- JOSEPH PROUDHON 63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"they have confined thems elves to the maintenance of order. ( .. . ) They reckoned that by straying from the legal path and pitching ( . .. ) the people into Revol ution, they would have fo rfeited their mandate .

( . . . ) Rather than resort to summar y, extra-legal methods agains t the rich ( .. , ) they have set integrity in the place of policy . ( . . . ) They were filled with honor and scruples ( ... ) slaves oflegality , incorruptible guardians of democratic decency.\" As Colette Audry has written aprop os of Leon Blum, they were de­ termined to be \"just. \"3 They took \" delicacy to the lengths of meticulous ness, respect fo r persons , opinions and interests to the lengths of [self-] sacrif ice.\" Among the bankrupters of 1848, the one whom Proudhon bore the most animosity was Louis Blanc . In his estimation, Blanc bore the heaviest re­ sponsibil ity, in that he styled himself a \"socialist.\" On 17 March 1848, Louis Blanc had been one of the organizers of a huge popular demonstration that had attracted upwards of 100,000 work ers. But he had prevented its being turned into a gauntlet thrown down to the government to compel it to take a more vigorous line with regard to those sabotaging the Revol ution. Proudhon could not fo rgive Blanc this let-do wn. \"What! Here we have a man convinced that the men in power, his colleag ues, are hostile towards progr ess: that the Revol ution is in jeopardy unless they are succes sfully replaced: he knows that opportun ity is rare , and, once past, is never repeated: that he has but one chance to strike a decisive blow : and when that chance comes along, he seizes upon it only to hold back those who offer him their comm itment and their muscle '\" And, to conclude his embittered descripti on, the imprisoned Proudhon lets slip this bittersweet comment: \"The revolution evaporated like drawn- off alcoho l.\" But this swinging criticism of its unsaf e steersmen was not the only lesson that Proudhon drew from the 1848 Revol ution: as we shall have occas ion to see, it prompted him in his vigorous and innovat ive condemnation of the State and of power generall y. PROUDHON JOINS IN THE FRAy4 The February Revol ution erupted. As indeed might be imagined, I had no inclin ation to throw myself into this politic o-social mess where Monsieur Lamartine5 was translating the com monplaces of diplomacy into poetic prose; where there was talk of bringing the whole of commerce, ofindust ry, and soon of agriculture, one after another, into associa tions or State control; of buying 64 PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"out all property and working it along administr ative lines; of centralizing capital and competences in the hands of the State; then of carrying this governmental regime out to the peoples of Europe at the head of our victorious armies. I felt that there was greater usefulness in pressing ahead with my laborious studies behind the scenes, in the conviction that that was the only way in which I could be of service to the Revol ution, and in the certainty that neither the provisional government nor the neo-Jacobi ns would steal a march on me. ( .. . ) While I, alone of my persu asion , was slicing through the carapace of the old political economy. While P. Leroux, Ville garde lle, Vidal6 and a handful of others were pressing ahead in different directions with this scientific task of demo lition, what were the organs of democracy up to? What were they about? Alas! Allow me to remind them, least the socialists alone bear the responsibility fo r the misfortunes of the Repub lic: they were indulging their parliamentary preoccupa tions. Stubbornl y sidestepping social issues lest they frighten their subscribers , and preparing to cloak February in mystery. Through this de­ liberate oversight, they were organizing the national workshop s: they were drafting the provisional gover nment's decrees and unwitting ly laying the fo undations of the reasona ble, moderate repub lic. Le National, no harm to it, heaping curses on socialism, was pushing through the fo rtifications of Paris; La Riforme, smugly well-me aning, was standing by universal suffrage and by the govern mentalism of Louis Blanc . They were allowing utopia to flourish when it ought to have been pulled up by the roots : ( ... ) Neverthele ss it took the experience of February fo r our Statesmen to be convinced that a revo lution is not presc ribed nor impro vised. ( ... ) Thus, democracy spent itself in the pursuit of that power which it is precisely designed to annihila te through diffusion. All party factions had fallen, one after another; with the Exec utive Commission dismissed, we were on to the next generation of repub licans, rubbing shoulders with the doctrinarians. Unless we could stem this retreat, or at least accommodate it within the constitutional orbit, the Republic was in peril-but that required a complete change of tack. We had to stand in opposition, and place the authorities on the defensive, widen the battlefield, and simplif y the social question by genera lizing it: stunning the enem y by the audacity of our proposals, hencef orth lobbying the people rather than their representativ es, steadf astly countering the blind passions of the reac­ tion with the philosophical and revol utionary idea of Februa ry. One party did not play along with this tactic : it demanded a steadf ast, even eccentric individualism, a spirit fo rged fo r protest and negatio n. Whether it PIERRE -JOSEPH PROUDHON 65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"was hubris or lightheadedn ess, I thought that IllY time had come . It was up to me, I told myself, to throw myself into the turmoil. The democrats, seduced by the memories of our glorious revolut ion, sought to re-enact the drama of 1789 in 1848: while they staged their comed y, we strove to make history. The Republ ic's fate was now in the hands of God. While one blind fo rce was pulling the authorities in one direction, might we not manage to push society fo rwards down another? The directions of minds having changed, it would fo llow that the government, in persisting with reaction, would then, unwitting ly, spark off revolution . And from my seat in the audienc e, I hurled myself , a new actor, into the drama. My name had caused enough of a sensation over the preceding 18 months fo r me to be fo rgiven fo r offering a few explan ations, a fe w apologies fo r my notorie ty. For good or ill, I had had my portion of influence upon my country's fate: who could tell if that influence, stronger now precise ly because it was concen trated, might yet be brought to bear? Thus it was import ant that my contemporaries should know what I wanted, what I had done, what I am. I am not bragging; I would simply be flattered if, after reading, my readers were to be left with the conviction that ther e is neither fo lly nor fu ry in my actions. The only vanity my heart has ever entertained was the belief that no man had conducted his entire life with more deliberation or more disce rn­ ment than I have . But I disco vered to my cost that in the very moments when I thought myself most free, I was still, amid the torrent of political passions to which I was seeking to give some direction, merely an in strument of that im moral providence that I deny and repudi ate. Perhaps the history of my delibera tions, which cannot be disenta ngled from that of my actions, may prove of some advantage to those who, whatever their views, like to look to experience fo r justifica tion of their ideas. ( . . .) The revolution of contem pt brought low the gove rnment that had established the materialist princ iple of inter ests. That revol ution which condemns capital, by that very action ushers and carries labor into gove rn­ ment. Now, accordingly to the widespread prejudice, labor, having become government, ought to proceed along governmental lines: in other words, it is up to government hencef orth to do that which had been done without it and in spite of it, to seize the initiat ive and prosecute the revol ution .

( ... ) As fo r myself, and I make no bones about it, I have gi ven my all to political disorganiza tion, not out of revolut ionary impat ience, not out oflove fo r some empty notoriety, not out of ambition, envy or hatred, but in antici­ pation of inevitable backlash and, in every instance, out of the certainty I had that demo cracy could achie ve nothing of any good through the governme ntal hypothesis to which it persisted in clinging. As for the masses, meager thoug h their intelligence might be and weak though I know their virtue to be, I fo und them less frightening in the midst of anarchy than at the ballot box. Among the people as among childr en, crimes and trespasses have more to do with shifting impr essions than perversity of the soul, and I found it easier fo r a republi can elite to complete the people's education in a setting of political chaos than to have it exercise its sovereignty, with small prospect of success, throug h the bal­ lot box.7 PROUDHON TH E UNSE AT ED CA NDI DATE (APRI L 1848)8 ( ... ) Along came the April election s. I deluded myself into running as a candidate. In the circular that I addressed to the voters in the Doubs, dated April 3, lR4R, I stated: The social question has been posed; you will not get out of it.

Within it, one finds, side by side, an i1l5pired anticipation (!f contemporary self-management, a somewhat utopian and, to be sure, petit bourgeois \"m utualist\" notion of social reorganization, a rather aberrant preoccupation with preserving property on a small scale, and a reluctance to impose taxes upon it or upon larger scale property, and,finally, a revolutionar y social­ ist stance vis-a-vis participation in presidential elections which Proudhon regarded as a \"dismal affair,\" and a straighiforward opportunity to set out his program. The central electoral committee, comprising delegates from the fo urteen Seine arrondissements and designed to make preparation fo r the election of the president of the Republ ic, has just concluded its opera tions. Citizen Raspail, the people's repre senta tive, has been selected unanim ously as the cand idate of the social democratic repub lican party. The centr al committee is to publish its circular to electors without delay.

Throughout history, the ambitious and scheming have, in more or less pompous language, promised the people: Liberty, equality and Work, fa mily, property and progr ess; Credit, educ ation, associa tion, order and peace; Participation in government, equita ble distri bution of taxes, honest and inexpen sive admin istration, fair courts, move ment towards equality of income, emancipation of the proletariat and eradication of poverty!

The true friends of the people must hencef orth adopt a diffe rent tack. What the people expects of its candidat es, what it asks of them, is not prom ises now, but practicalities. It is upon these practicalities that they suggest men should be judged: and it is upon such that we ask that we be judged. As socialist-democr ats, we belong, in truth, to no sect, no school. Or, rather, if we were obliged to come up with a description of ourselves, \\ve should say that we are of the critical school. For us, socialism is not a system: it is, quite simpl y, a protest. We beli eve, though, that from socialist works is dedicated a series of principles and ideas at odds with economic conv ention, and which have been absor bed into popular belief , which is why we call ourse lves socialists. Professing socialism while embr acing nothing of social­ ism, as the more artful do, would be tantamount to gulling the people and abusing its credulo usness. Being a republ ican is not the last word: it is not the last word to ackno wledge that the Republic ought to be surrounded by social institution s; it is not enough to inscribe upon one's banner, DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL REPUB LIc-one must plainl y point up the difference between the old society and the new. One has to spell out the positive product of socialism: and wherein and why the February Revol ution which is the expression thereof , is a social revol ution. For a start, let us recall socialis m's unde rlying dogma, its pure dogma. The objective of socialism is emancipation of the proletariat and eradica­ tion of poverty, which is to say, effective equality of circumstances between men. In the absence of equal ity, there will always be poverty , always be a prole tariat. Socialism, which is egalitarian above all else, is thus the democratic fo r­ mula par excell ence. Should less honest politicians be mealy-m outhed about admitting it, we respect their reserva tions, but they ought to know that-in our view-they are no democrat s. Now, what can be the origin of this inequal ity) As we see it, that origin has been brought to light by a whole series of so­ cialist criticisms, partic ularly since Jean- Jacques [Roussea u]-that origin is the realizat ion within society of this triple abstraction: capital , labor and talent. It is because society has divided itself into three categories of citizen corre­ sponding to the three terms in that fo rmula -that is, because of the fo rmation 72 PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"of a class of capitalists or proprietors , another class of worker s, and a third of talents-that caste distinct ions have always been arrived at, and one half of the human race enslaved to the other. Whereso ever an attempt has been made to separate these three things­ capital, labor and talent -effectively and organically, the worker has wound up enslaved: he has been descri bed, turn and turn about as slave, serf, pariah, plebeian and proletari an, and the capitalist has proved the exploiter. He may go variou sly by the name of patrician or noble , proprietor or bour geois -the lllan of talent has been a parasite, an agent of corruption and servitude. At fi rst he was the priest, then he was the cleric, and today the public fu nctionar y, all manner of competence and monop oly. The underlying dogma of socialism thus consists of reducing the aristo­ cratic fo rmula of capital-labor-talent into the simpler fo rmula oflabor! ... in order to make every citizen simultaneous ly, equall y and to the same extent capital ist, laborer and expert or artist. In reality as in econ omic scien ce, producer and consumer are always one and the same person, merely considered from two different viewpoints . Why should the same not be true of capitalist and laborer? of laborer and artist? Separate these qualities in the organization of society and inexorably you create castes , inequality and miser y; amalgamate them , on the other hand, and in every individual you have equality , you have the Repu blic. And that is how in the political order, all these distinctions between gove rnors and governe d, admini strators and admini stered, public fu nctionaries and tax-payers, etc., must some day be erased. Each citizen must, through the spread of the social idea, become all; for, ifhe be not all, he is not free: he suffers oppression and exploitation somewhere . So, by what means is this great amalgamation to be brought to pass? The mean s is indicated by the affliction itself. And, first of all, let us try to define that affliction better, if possible. Since the organic origin of the proletariat and of poverty is located in the division of society into two classes: one that works and owns not; and another that owns but works not and, consequen tly, consumes without producing. It fo llows that the affliction by which socie ty is beset consists of this singular fiction according to which capital is, of itself , producti ve; whereas labor, of itself , is not. In fact, fo r all thing s to be equal in this hypothesis of the sepa­ ration of labor and capital, then, because the capitalist profits by his capital without working, so the worker should profit fr om his labor, in the absence PIER RE-JO SEPH PROU DHON 73"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"of capital . Now, that is not the case. So, in the current system, equality. lib­ erty and fraternity are impossible: and thus, poverty and proletariat are the inevita ble consequence of prop erty as present ly consti tuted. Anyone knowing that but not confessing it is lying equa lly to bour geoisie and to proletariat. Anyone courting the people's votes but keeping this from it is neither a socialist nor a democrat. We say again: The productivity of capital, which Christian ity has condemned under the designation of \"usury,\" is the true cause of poverty , the true origin of the prole tariat, the never- ending obstacle to estab lishm ent of the Republ ic. No equiv ocation, no mum bo-jumbo, no sleight of hand I Let those who profess to be socialist demo crats join us in signing this profession offaith; let them join our compan y. Then , and then only, will we acknowledge them as brothers , as true friends of the people, and will we associa te ourselves with their every act. And now, what is the means whereby this afflicti on can be eradicated, this usury tenninated? Is it to be an attack upon net produc t, seizure of revenue' Is it to be, while professing utmost regar d fo r propertv , the ravishing of property by means oflevy, as it is acquired through work and enshrined by law? It is on this count above all that the true fr iends of the people stand apart from those whose only wish is to command the people; it is on this count that true socialists part compan y with their treacherom imitators . The means of destroying usury, is not, let us repeat , the confiscation of usury: it is by coun tering princi ple with principle, in short, by organizing credit. As fa r as socia lism is concerned, the organization of credit does not mean lendi ng at interest, since that would still be an acknowle dgment of capital 's suzerainty: it is, rather, organizing the workers' mutual solidarity , introd ucing their mutual guaran tees, in accordance with that vulgar economic princi ple that anything that has an exchange value is suscep tible to becoming an article of exchange and can, in conseq uenc e, fu rnish the basis fo r credit. Just as the banker lends money to the business man who pays him interest upon the loan. Or the estate-owner lends his land to the peasant who pays him a rent fo r it. Or the house- owner lets his tenant have lodgings in return fo r payment of rent. Or the merchant lets his goods go to the customer who pays on the installment plan: 74 PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"So the worker lends his labor to the employer who pays him by the week or by the month. Every one of us vouchsafes something on credit: do we not talk about selling on credit, working on credit, drinking on credit? Thus labor can make an advance of itself , and can be as much the creditor as capital can. Furtherm ore, two or more workers can advance one another their re­ specti ve produc ts, and, if they were to come to an arrangement regar ding perman ent transactions of this sort, they would have organ ized credit among themse lves. This is what those labor associa tions are to be admired fo r having grasped which have spontaneou sly, without prom pting and without capital been fo rmed in Paris and in Lyon, and which, merely by liaising with one another and making loans to one another, have organized labor as we said. So that, organ ization of credit and organization oflabor amount to one and the same. It is no school and no theoretician that is sa ying this: the proof of it, rather, lies in current practice, revolutionary practi ce. Thus application of one princi ple leads the people towards disco very of another, and one solution arrived at al­ ways opens doors to another. Ifit were to come about that the workers were to come to some arrangement throughout the Republic and organize thems elves along similar lines, it is obvious that, as masters oflabor, const antly generat ing fresh capital through work, they would soon have wrested alienated capital back again, through their organization and competition; they would attract to their side, to start with , small property, small traders and small industries: then la rge - sca l e property and large industries; then the very biggest ventures, mines, canals and railways: they would become the masters of it all, through the succes sive affiliation of producers and the liquidation of property without the proprietors' being despoiled or indemnif ied. ( ... ) Such is the undertaking upon which the people has spontaneou sly embarked before our very eyes, an undertaking that it prosecutes with ad­ mirable vigor, weathering all difficulties and the most frightf ul privations . And we ought not to weary of saying that this movement was initiated, not by the leaders of schoo ls, and that the primary instigation came not from the State but from the people. We are merely its spokesmen here. Our creed, the democratic and social creed, is not a utopia any more: it is a fa ct. This is not our doctrine that we are preaching; these are the people's ideas that we have taken up as themes for our explorati ons.

( . . . ) Should the government, the National Assembly, the very bour geoisie sponsor and assist us in the accomplishment of our undertaking, we will be grateful fo r that. But let none try to distract us fr om what we regard as the people's true interests; let none try to decei ve us with the empty sham of reforms. We are too clear-sighted to fa ll fo r that again, and we knO\\v more of the workings of the world than the politicians who regale us with their admonitions . We should be delighted if the State were to contribute through its bud­ getary provisions to the emancipation of the worke rs. We would look only with mistrust upon what is termed State organization of credit, which is, as we see it, merely the latest fo rm of man's exploitation of his fellow-man. We repudiate State credit, because the State, in debt to the tune of eight billio ns, does not possess a centime that it could advance by way of a loan: because its finances repose solely upon paper of obligatory usage: because obligatory usage necess arily entails depreciation, and depre ciation always hits the worker rather than the proprietor: because we associated workers or workers in the process of association, Ileed neither the State nor obligatory usage in the orga nizatio n of our intercourse: because, in the end, credit fr om the State is always credit from capital, not cr edit from labor, and still monar chy rather than democr acy. Under the arrangement suggested to us and which we reject with all of the vigor of our convic tions, the State, in the a\\var ding of credit, first has to secur e capital. For such capital, it must look to property , by way of taxation . So we still have this reversion to princi ple when the point is to destr oy it; we have displacement of wealth, when we ought to have its creation ; we ha\\'e with drawal of property , after it has been declared by the constitution to be inviolable. Let others ofless advanced and less suspect ide as, meticulous in their morals, support such ideas , and we will not question their tactics. But we, who wage war, not upon the rich but upon principles: we whom the counter -revol ution never wearies of vilifying; we have to be more demanding. We are socialists, not despoilers. We do not want progres sive taxat ion, because progress ive taxation is the validation of net prod uct and we wish to do away with net product, through 76 PIER RE-Jos EPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"association: because, if progressi ve taxation fa ils to divest the rich man of all his wealth, it is merely a concession made to the proletariat, a sort of ransom fo r the right of usury, in short, a trick; and if it seizes all income, it amounts to confisca tion of property, to expropriation without prior indemnific ation and is of no public use. So let those who claim to be primaril y politicians invoke progres sive taxa­ tion by way of a reprisal against property, a punishment fo r bourgeois selfish­ ness: we respect their intentions and if it should ever happen that they get the chance to implement their princ iples, we will bow to the will of God. As fa r as we repre senta tives of those who have lost every thing to the rule of capital are concerned, progr essive taxation, precisely because it is an enf orced restitution , is off-limits to us: we will never propose it to the people. We are socialists , men of reconcilia tion and progr ess: we seek neither reaction nor loi agraire. We do not want levies upon State revenu es, because such a levy is, like progr essive taxation in the case of rentiers , mere confiscation , and in the case of the people, mere sleight of hand, trickery. We believe that the State is entitled to repay its debts, and thus to borrow at the lowe st rates of interest: we do not think that it is licit fo r it, under cover of taxatio n, to default upon its commi tments . We are socialists, not bankrupters . We do not want taxes upon inherit ance, because such a tax is likewise merely a retreat from property , and, prop erty being a cOllStitutional right acknow ledged universall y, the wishes of the majority must be respected with regard to it because that would be a trespass against the family; because, in order to emancipate t h e pro l etar i at , we need not indulge in such fr esh hyp oc­ risy.

We do not seek taxes upon luxury items , because that would be to strike a blow against the luxur y industries: because luxury items are the very badge of progr ess: because, with labor in the ascen dant and capital subor dinated, luxury must extend to each and every citizen. Why, having encouraged proper ty, would we retaliate against proprietors for their pleasures? We are socialists, not begrudgers .

For which reason we ask fo r certain things that socialis m suggests, and which men who purport to be particul arly political fa il to understand. Politics tends to lead to speciali zation and indefinite proliferation of jobs: socialism tends to amalgamate them all. Thus we believe that virtuall y the totality of public works can and should be carried out by the army; that such participation in public works is the primar y duty that the republican youth owes to its home land; that, as a result, the army budget and the public works budget duplicate each other . That represents a saving of more than 100 millions: politics overlooks that. Ther e is talk of trades educat ion. We believe that agricu ltural training comes in the form of agriculture: the school fo r arts, craf ts and manuf actur e is the wo rk s ho p; the school fo r commerce is the coun ting- house; the mining school is the mine; the navigation school the navy; the administr ation school the civil service, etc. The appre ntice is as necessa ry to the job as the journey man; why put him to one side in a schooP We want the same education fo r everyb ody: what good are schools which the people sees as only schools fo r aristocr ats and which repre sent a double drain upon our finances?

Freedom of assembl y. Freedom of religion. Freedom of the press. Freedom of thought and of speech. Freedom oflabor, trade and industry. Freedorn of education. In short, absolute freedom. Now, among these freedom s, there is still one that the old politics will not countenance, which makes a nonsense of all the rest! Will they tell us once and fo r all if they want freedom on condition or uncondition al freedom? We want the fa mily: where is there anyone who respects it more than we do? But we do not mistak e the family for the model of socie ty. Defenders of monarchy have taught us that monarchies were made in the image of the family. The family is the patriar chal or dynastic element , the rudiment of royalt y: the model of civil society is the fraternal association.

THE GOVERNM ENTAL PREJUD ICE2 The fo rm in which the earliest men thought of order within society was the patriar chal or hierarchical fo rm, which is to say, in essence, authority and, in operation, government. Justice, which was later dissected into the distributive and comm utative, at first showed itself to them under its first aspect only: a superior bestowing upon his inf eriors the portion that was their due. Thus the gove rnmental idea arises out of family practice and domestic experience: conse quentl y, there was no objection voiced, government ap­ pearing as natural to society as the subordination that obtains between the father and his children. Which is why Monsieur de Bonald3 was correct in saying that the family is the embryo of the State, whose essential categories it reprod uces: the king being the father figure, the minister being the mother, the subject the child. For that reason too, the fraternity socialists who accept the family as a buildi ng-block of societ y, all arrive at dictatorship, the most exaggerated fo rm of governm ent. Monsieur Ca bet's adminis tration in the States ofNauvo 04 is a splendid example of this. How much longer will it be before we grasp this ideal connection? The primiti ve conception of order through gove rnment is the common prop erty of all peopl es: and while the efforts made right from the beginning to organize, curtail, and modif y the operations of authority and tailor them to general needs and to circumstan ces, demonstrate that negation was implicit in affirmation, the certain ty is that no rival hypothesis has been advanced; the spirit has remained the same throughout. As nations have emerged from the savage and barbarous state, we have seen them promptly embark upon the gove rnment path, run the gamut of institutions which are always the same, and which all the historians and publicists categorize under these succes sive headings: monar chy, aristocracy and demo cracy. But here is a matter of greater seriousnes s. The governmental prejudice having permeated every recess of the con­ sciousn ess, striking the reason in its seat, every other outlook has long since been rendered impos sible, and the most daring of think ers have as a result PIERRE -JOS EPH PROUDHON 81"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"ventured the opinion that while government W:lS undoubtedly a scourge, and a blight upon society, it was neverth eless a necessary evil. Which is why, right up to our own day, the most liberating revolutions and all offreedom's stirrings have repeate dly culmin ated in a pledge ofloyalty and submission to authority: why all revolutions have served only to recon­ stitute tyranny: and I no more except from this rule the Constitution of '93 than the one in 1848, even though both were the most advanced expressions of French democracy. What has sustained this mental predisposition and made this fascination for so long invincible is that, following the supposed analogy between society and the family, government has always been presented to men's minds as the natural agent of justice, the protection of the weak and the keeper of the peace. As a result of this providential and sacrosanct attribute, government ensconced itself in men's hearts and minds alike. It became part of the mental furniture of the world: it was citizens' faith, their innermost and invincible superstition. If it should weaken, it was said of it, as it was of religion and of property: it is not the institution which is evil, but the abuse of it. It is not that the king is mischievous, it is his ministers: \"AB, If ONLY THE KING WERE AW ARE ! \" And so, added to the hierarchical and absolutist aspects of a governing authori ty, there was an ideal that addressed the soul and conspired unceas­ ingly agains t the yearning for equality and independence: while the people, every time there was a revolution, thinking to effect reforms, obedient to the promptings of its heart and the vices of its government, was betrayed by its very own ideas. In the belief that it was entrusting its interests to the authorit ies, it had always in reality acted in its own worst interests: instead of a protector, it found itself a tyrant. Experience shows, indeed, that always and everywhere, government, no matter how popular it may have been in its origins, has sided with the best educated and wealthiest class against the poorest and most numerous one: that after having shown its liberal face for a time, it has gradually become excep­ tional and exclusive : finally, that instead of securing freedom and equality for all, it has toiled doggedly at destroying these things, on account of its natural predispo sition towards privilege. ( . . . ) The negation of government, which is, in essence, Morelly's utopia,S which beams out a hastily extinguished light, through the sinister demonstra­ tions of the Enrages and Hebertistes and which would have emerged from the teachings ofBabeuf , had Babeufbeen able to think his O\\vn principle through 82 PIERRE -JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"and make deductions from it-that great and telling negation traversed the whole of the 19th centu ry, all misund ersto od.

Saint-Sim on6 was the first to trace the connection, albeit in fa ltering terms and with a still vague grasp of the phenomen on: \"The human species,\" he wrote in 1818, has been fa ted to live first under governmental and fe udal rule: It has been doomed to pass fr om go vernmental or military rule to admin­ istrative or industrial rule, after having made suf fic ient progress in the po sitive sciences and in industry: Finall y, it has been doomed by [t he manner of] its orga nization to pass throug h a long and violent crisis in the course of its transition fr om the mili­ tary to the peacef ul system. The present time is an age of transition: The transitional crisis opened with Luther's preaching: since that time, minds have been of an ess entia lly cr itical and revolutionary bent. ( ... ) The whole of Saint-Simon is encapsulated in those few lines, writ­ ten in the style of the pro phets , but too hard to digest for the times in which they were written, too condensed fo r the young minds which were the first to latch on to the noble innovator. ( ... ) What was Saint-Simon's meaning? From the moment that, on the one hand, philoso phy supplants faith and replaces the old notion of government with that of contract: when, on the other hand, in the wake of a revolu tion that has done away with the fe udal regime, society seeks to develop its economic potential and achieve harmony within it: from that moment fo rth, it is inevitable that government, being repudiated at the level of theory, is progressi vely demo lished in practice. And when Saint-Simon, in descr ibing the new order of things, keeps to the old style and employs the word \"gove rnment\" together with the qualification \"adminis trative\" or \"industri al,\" it must be obvious that the term, coming trom his pen, takes on a metaph orical or rather analogical meaning to which only PIERRE- JOSEPH PROUDHON 83"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"the uninitia ted could be blind. How could there be any misreading of Saint­ Simon's thinking after reading this even more explicit passage. I quote: If one looks at the course taken by the education of the in divid ual, one finds, in pri mary schoo ling , that the act of gov ernance is the primary fa ctor: and in schooling beyond that level, one sees the act of gov erning the chil dren con­ tinuall y lessen ing in intens ity , while teaching plays an incr easi ng ly im portant role. The sam e has been true of the education of soc iety. Mi litar v, which is to sa y fe udal (governmental) action, must ha ve been stronger in its inf ancy; it has always had to assert its importance: and administ rative power must, of neces sity, wind up triumphant over mili tary power. To these extracts from Saint-Sim on we ought to add his fa mous Parabole which struck the world of of ficial dom like an ax in 1819, and in conseq uence of which its author was arraigned before the assizes on February 20, 1820 and acquitted. The length of that all too notorious piece prohibit, us fr om citing it. As may be seen, Saint-Sim on's negation is not a deduction fr om the notion of contract, which Rousseau and his sectarians had corrupted and dishon ored over an 80-year period: rather, it flows from another flash of quite experiential and a posterior intuition, as befits an observer of events. What contract theor y, prompted by providential logic , had supposedly antici pated in so c i e t y ' s fu ture prosp ects ever since Jurieu 's7 day-to wit, the end of gove rnments-S aint-Si­ mon, putting in an appearance in the heyda y of the parliamentary scrimm age, registers as part and parcel of the law of human evolution. Thus, the theory of right and the philoso phy of history, like two surveyor's staffs planted one behin d the other, led the mind towards an unkn own revolu tion: one more step and we are grappl ing with the phenom enon . ( ... ) The 18th centu ry, as I believe I have demonstrated more than amply, had it not been derailed by Roussea u's classical, backward-lo oking, declama tory republ icanism, would, by extrapolation upon the contract idea, which is to say by the juridical route, have arrived at negation of government. Saint-Sim on deduced that negation from his scrutin y of history and of the education of mankin d. If I may cite myself at this point when I alone repre­ sent the datum of revol ution, I in turn derive it from analysis of economic fu nctions and from the theory of credit and excha nge.

Rousseau, Sieyes, Robespierre, Guizot, that whole school of parliamentarians , were the standar d-bearers of reaction .8 One man, very belatedl y alerted by the degradation of the guiding princip le, brought this young and fruitf ul idea once more into the light: unfortunate ly, the realistic aspect to his doctrine blinds his own disciples: they fa il to see that the producer is the negation of the governor, that organization cannot be reconciled with authority: and fo r a fu rther 30 years the fo rmula was lost from sight. ( ... ) The idea of anarchy had scarcely been planted in the popular soil before there instantly sprang up so-ca lled conser vatives to water it with their calumni es, fatten it upon their violenc e, warm it beneath the cloches of their hatred and afford it the support of their inane reactions . Thanks to them, it has today mooted the idea of anti- govern ment, the idea of labor, the idea of contrac t: it grows , it climbs, its tendrils wrap thems elves around the workers' societies: and soon, like the little mustard seed in the Gospe ls, it will blossom into a huge tree whose branches will cover the whole of the earth. The sovereignty of reason having replaced that of revelation: The no­ tion of contract taking over from that of governme nt: Historical evolution necessa rily steering humanity into fresh practice: Economic criticism even now registering that under this new regime, the political institution must be absor bed into the industrial organism: We fe arlessly conclude that the fo rmula for revolution can no longer be either direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified gove rnment : but is-no more gov ernment. N either mona rchy nor aristocracy nor even democr acy, insof ar as this third expression might imply some government, operating in the people's name and purporting to be the peop le. No authori ty, no government, not even popular government: therein resides the revol ution.

If evolution, instead of taking place merely in the mind, in the form of theorie s, is simultane ously effected through institutions and acts, it constitutes history. This is the case with the authority principle or government. The first term in which that principle is displayed is absolute authority. That is the purest, most rational, most emphatic, frankest and, all things considered, least immoral and least irksome formulation of government. But absolutism, in its unadorned form, is odious to reason and to liberty: throughout the ages, pe oples' consciousnesses have bridled at it: in the wake of consciousness , rebellion has made its objections heard. So the principle has been forced into retreat: it has retreated step by step, through a series of concessions, each of them more inadequate than the next, the latest of which, pure democracy or direct government, amounts to impossibil ity and absurdity. The first term in the series being absolutism, its fateful, final term is anarchy, taken in its broadest sense. We shall now review, one by one, the main staging-posts in this great becoming. Humanity asks its masters: \"Why do you seek to rule over me and gov­ ern me?\" To which they reply: \"Because society cannot do without order: because a society has need of men who are obedient and who labor, while others command and direct: because, since individual talents differ, interests conflict with one another , and passions compete and the particular advantage of the individual runs counter to the common good, there is a need for an authority to prescribe the limits of rights and duties, some arbiter to settle disputes , some public force to see that the sovereign 's verdict is carried out. Now, power, the State, is precisely that discretionary authority , the arbiter that renders unto each person that which is his, the force that guarantees and enforces the peace. Government, in short, is the principle and guarantor of order in society: common sense and nature both proclaim it.\" Throughout the ages, from out the mouths of all authorities, you will hear the same, unvarying message-in the tomes of the Malthusian econom ists, in the newspapers of the reaction and in the testimonials of repub licans. The only thing that differentiates them one from another is the extent of the con­ cessions they intend to make to freedom on this principle: those concessions are illusory concessions which add to so-called tempera te, constituti onal, 86 PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"democratic etc., fo rms of government a seasoning of hypocri sy, the taste of which merely leaves them more unpalata ble. Thus government, in its simplicit y, offers itself as the absolute, necessa ry, sine qua non condition fo r order. Which is why it always, regardless of what mask it may wear, aspires to absol utism: indeed, according to the principle, the stronger the government, the nearer perfect order. Those two notions -gov­ ernment, and order-ther efore, allege dly, have a cause and effect relationshi p with one another: government being the cause and order its effect. That indeed was the reasoning of prim itive societi es. ( . .. ) But that reasoning is nonetheless false, and its conclusion wholly untenable, since according to the logical classification of ideas , government's relationship with order is not at all, despite what heads of State may claim, that of cause with effect, but rather the relationshi p of the particular to the general. Order being the general ; gove rnment being the specimen. In other words, there are several ways oflooking at order: who can prove to us that order in society is that which it pleases society's masters to describe as such? On the one hand, they invoke the natural inequality of talents , from which they arrive by induc tive reasoning at the conclusion that there shoul d be a natural inequal ity of condition s: on the other , they cite the impossi bility of reducing divergent interests to unity and of reconciling sentimen ts. But at best that antagonism should be viewed as a problem to be resolved, not as a pretext fo r tyrann y. Inequality of talents? Divergenc e of interests? Well now, you sovereigns with your crowns, fa sces and sashes, that is preci sely what we mean by the socia l question: and do you believe that it can be banished by baton and bayonet? Saint-Simon was quite right to take those two words, governmental and milit ary, as being synonymou s. Government bringing order to society is Alexander cutting the Gordian knot with his sword . Who then, ye shepherds of the peoples, author izes your belie f that the problem of contradictory interests and unequal talents admits of not resolu­ tion? That class differences naturall y follow from them? And that, in order to preserve that natural and providential differentiation, fo rce is not merely necess ary but legitil 1late� I contend, on the contr ary-and all those whom the world descri bes as utopians because of their repudiation of your tyrann y contend with me-that a solution to that problem can be fo und. Some have thought to disco ver it in commun ity, others in associa tion, still others in mas­ sive industri alization . For my own part, I say that the it lies in the organization PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON 87"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"of economic fo rces under the aegis of the supreme law of contract. Who tells you that none of these hypotheses is true? By way of a counter to your governmental theor y, which has no derivation other than your ignoranc e, no princi ple other than a sophi stry, no method other than fo rce, no purpose other than exploitation of human endea vor, of the progress oflabor and of ideas, you place in my mouth this liberal theo­ rem: find some fo rm of comprom ise which, reducing diver gence of interests to unity, identif ying the particular good and the general good, substit uting inequality of education fo r innate inequal ity, resolves all political and economic contradiction s; where every individual is equall y and synonymou sly producer and consum er, citizen and prince, admini strator and administered: where his freedom is fo rever expanding, without his being required ever to fo rswear any of it: v,,·here his well-being increases indefinitely, without his being able to suffer trespass by societ y or his fe llow-citizens against either his proper ty, his labor, his income or his interest, \"opinion\" or sentiment-based dealing s \\vith his neighbors . What! Such specif ications strik e you as impossi ble to meet? The social contrac t, when you think of the terrif ying multitude of relationships that it has to regulate, seems to you the most unfathomable thing conc eivable, something akin to the squaring of a circle and to perpetual motion. Which is why, war-wear y, you lapse again into absolutism , into fo rce. Consider however that if the social contract can be agreed between two producers-and who could doubt that, reduced to such simple terms, it would be susceptible to resolutio n?-it call be agreed between a milli on too, since we are still talking about the same commitment, the number of signatories, while rendering it more and more effective, adding to it not one iota. Where­ upon your powerle ssness argument fa lls apart : it is laughable and leaves you without a defense. In any event, you men of power, this is what the producer, the proletar­ ian, the slave, the man whom you would have work in your place, has to sa y to you: I ask for no man's property and no man's brasse, � and am not disposed to coun tenance the fruits of my labors becoming another man's prey. I too want order, every bit as much as, and more than, those who breach it with their alleged government: but I want it to be a product of my will, a condition of my labor and a testimonial to 111y reason. I will never tolerate its coming from someone else's will, fo isted upon me with servitude and sacrifice as its precon ditio ns. 88 PIE RRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"ON LAWS In the face of the impatience of peoples and the imminence of rebellion, government was forced to yield: it promised institutions and laws: it has stated that its most fervent wish was that everyone might enjoy the fruits of his labor in the shade of his vine or of his fig tree. Its position required as much of it. Since, in fact, it posed as judge of the law, sovereign arbiter of men's fates, it could not purport to lead men according to its whim. King, president, direc­ tory, committee, popular assembly-wh atever-power must have a code of rules to live by; without that, how can it ever establish discipline among its subjects? How can citizens abide by its order, if they are not notified of it: if, right after being notified, it is rescinded: if it should change from day to day, from hour to hour? The government, then, has to make laws, that is to say, impose limits upon itself: because everything that is a rule for the citizen becomes a limitation upon the prince. He will pass as many laws as he finds interests: and since interests are beyond number and the relationships that are struck up multiply into infinity, and there is no end to antagonism, the law-making will have to operate non-stop. Laws, decrees, edicts, ordinances, writs will shower down upon the poor people like hailston es. After a time, the political ground will be covered with a layer of paper, which the geologists need only register as the \"papyraceous\" formation in the earth's rotations. In three years, one month and four days, the Convention issued 11,600 laws and decrees: the Constituent Assembly and Legislative Assembly were scarcely any less prolific: the Empire and governments since have done likewise. At present, the Bu lletill des Loi s registers, they say, upwards of 50,000; if our represent atives were to do their duty that enormous figure would soon be doubled. Do you think that the people and the Government itself can preserve its reason in this maze? True, we have come a long way since the primitive institution. In society, the government plays, so they say, a father's role: now, what fither ever bothered to enter into a compact with his family? To issue a charter to his children? To strike a balance of power between him self and their mother? In his governa nce, the paterfamilias is prompted by his heart: he does not prey upon his children but supports them through his own toil: by his love, he considers nothing ex­ cept his f:tmily's interests and circumstances: the law to him is what he wishes, and everyone, mother and child, trust in that. The petty State would be lost, if there was the slightest resistance to the father's actions, if those actions were limited in their prerogat ives and predeter mined in their effects. What! Might PIERRE-J OSEPH PROUDHON 89"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"it be that the government is not a father to the people because it is subject to regulations, makes comprOinises with its subjects and makes itself the prime slave of a rationale-be it divine or popular -which is not its own? Were that the case, I do not see why I should conform to the law myself. Who otTers me a guarantee of its justice and sincerity? Whence does it come to me? Who made it? Roussea u teaches correctly that in a truly democratic and free government, the citizen, ill obeying the law, is obeying only his own will. Now, the law has been made without my participation , and in spite of my absolute dissent, regardle ss of the trespass it may inflict upon me. The State does not negotiate with me; it offers nothing in return, it holds me to ransom. So where are the ties, of conscien ce, reason, passion or interest that place me under an obligation? But what am I saying? Laws-for him who thinks for himself and should be accountable for his own actions only, laws for him who aims to be free and feels called to become so; I stand ready to negotiate, but I want no part oflaws: I acknowledge none: I protest against every order with which some authority may feel pleased on the basis of some alleged necessity to over-rule my free will. Laws! We know what they are and what they are worth. Gossamer for the mighty and the rich, fetters that no steel could smash for the little people and the poor, fishing nets in the hands of government. You say that fe w laws will be passed and that they will be kept simple and be good ones. There we have another concession. The government really must be guilty if it admits its trespasses like that! A small number oflaws and excellent laws at that' Impossible. Must not government regulate every interest, sit in judgment of every challenge? Now, by the very nature of society, interests are innumerable, relations variable and infinitely fluid: So how can there be only a few laws made? How could they be straightf orward? How could the best oflaws not soon be despicable? They talk of simplification. But if there can be simplification on one count, there can be simplification on another: instead of a million laws, one will do. And what might that law be? Do not do unto others that which you do not wish done unto yourself. The law of the prophets. But obviously that is no longer a law: its is the basic formula of justice, the rule governing all intercourse. So legislative simplification brings us back to the idea of contract and cOllSequently to negation of authority . Indeed, if the law is singular, if it resolves all of society's antinomie s, if it has everybody's consent and en­ dorsement, it will suffice tor the social contract. In promulgating it, you are 90 PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"proclaiming the end of government. So who is stopping you from proceeding at once with this simplification? THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM ( . . . ) There are not two sorts of gove rnment , any more than there are two sorts of religion. Government is gove rnment by divine right or it is not: just as religion is from Heaven or it is not. Dem ocratic government and natural religion are two contra dictions, unless one would rather look upon them as two mystifications . The people no more has a consul tative voice in the State than in the Chur ch: its part is to obey and to believe. Also, just as princi ples cannot fa il and men are alone in enjoying the privilege of inconsequential ity, so gove rnment, according to Rousseau, as well as under the '91 Consti tution and all succeeding ones, is still, regardl ess of the election proced ure, only gove rnment by divine right, a mystical and supernatural authority over-riding freedom and conscien ce, while seeming to woo their support. Follow this logic : Inside the fa mily, where authority is implanted in men's hearts, government proceeds from procreation: In savage and barbarous settings, it proceeds from patriar chy, which meets the preceding definition, or of fo rce: In priestly settings, it proceeds from belief; In aristoc ratic settin gs, it proceeds from primogen iture, or caste; In Rousseau's system, which has come to be ours, it proceeds from fate, or numbers. Procreation, fo rce, belief, primog eniture, fate, numbers-all of them equall y unintelligi ble and unfathomable things, which it is pointless to reason about and which we would do better to just accept: these are, I will not say the princi ples-authority like liberty recognizes only itself as a princ iple-but the different modalities by which power is bestowed in human societies. For every primi tive, superior, preceding and incontrovertible principle, the popular instinct has, down through the ages, always looked fo r an expre ssion that was equa lly primitive, superio r, preceding and incontr overtible .

I have no belief at all-and with good cause-in the sure-f ooted intuition of the multitude which is supposed to enable it to discern the candidates' mer­ its and worthiness at a glanc e. There are examples galore of persons elected by acclamation who, even as they strode the platform to parade bef ore the intoxicated onlooke rs, were at work on the hatching of their betrayals.

Will the cost to me be any greater, and will I not be all the surer of myself than of my advocate? I am told that the thing must be settled: that it is not fe asible fo r me to look to such a diverse range of interests; that, when all is said and done, a whole panel of arbiters whose memb ership will have been appointed by the unanimous vote of the people, holds out the promise of an approx imation to truth and right that is much superior to the justice of an unacco untable monar ch, as represented by insolent ministers and magistrates whose tenure places them, like the prince, far beyond my reach . For a start I see no need to settle at that price: above all, I do not see it as being settled. Neither election nor vote, even should they be unanimous , resolve nothing. We have had recourse to both, to vary ing degrees, over the past sixty years , and what have we settled? What have we even defined? What illumina tion has the people obtained fr om its assemblies?

Such comprom ises have the moral consolation of testifying to the presence in men's souls of something loftier than justice-the sentiment offraternity. But in matters of principle, apropos of the very essence of rights and the direction with which society is to be endowe d: apropos of the organization of industrial forces: apropos of my labor, my subsiste nce, my life: apropos of the very hypothesis of government that we are dealing with-I recognize no conclave: I want to shift directly and individually for myself: universal suffrage strikes me as a real lottery. GO VE RNM ENT AND PE O PLE ( . .. ) Let me pass right on to the final hypothesis. Whereby the people, restored to absolute authority and acknowledging itself in its entirety as the despot, would deal with itself accordingly: where, as a result, it would amass all pow­ ers, as is only fair, and vest all authori ty-legislative, executive, judicial and otherwise, if such there be-in itself: where it would make all of the laws, issue all the decrees, ordinances , edicts, writs and judgments: issue all the orders: take to its bosom all its agents and functionari es, from the top of the hierarchy to the bottom: conveying its wishes directly to them without intermediary: overseeing and ensuring that those \\vishes were implemente d, by imposing proportionate responsibility upon everybody: would sit in judgment of all endowmen ts, civil lists, pensions and incentives: would, finally, as de fa cto and dejlire king, enjoy all the honors and prerogatives of sovereignty-p ower, money, pleasure, leisure, etc. ( . . . ) Regretta bly, that set-up, which is, I dare say, generally and in its details, beyond reproach. runs up against an insurmounta ble difficul ty in practice. Because a government implies a converse term, and if the people as a body, q ua sovereign , becomes the government, we will search in vain for the governed. The object of government is, let us remind ourselves, not to reduce the divergence of interests to unity-in which respect it acknow ledges its utter incompete nce-but rather to maintain order in society, in spite of conflict of interes ts. In other words, the object of government is to make up for absence of economic order and industrial harmon y. So should the people, in the interests of its liberty and sovereignty, take charge of the government, it can no longer 94 PIERRE -JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"concern itself with production, since, by the very nature of things, produc­ tion and government are two irreconci lable Llctors, and attem pting to marry them together would be tantamount to sowing division every where .

Or the executed) ( ... ) We must move on to the extreme hypothes is, whereby the people joins the government en masse, exercising every authority and spends all of its time in delib erations, voting and implementing, like in an insurrection, of one mind throughout, with nothing above it-n ot presid ent, not represen tative s, not commiss ioners , not the pays legal and not the majority: in short, where it alone, as a body, makes the laws and is the sole fu nction ary. But if the people, thus organized fo r the exerc ise of power, effectively no longer has anything above it, let me ask this: what does it have beneath it? In other words, where is gove rnment's conv erse? Where are the fa rmers , the industrialists, the businessmen, the soldiers? Where are the toilers and the citizens? Will it be the contention that the people is every thing at once, that it pro­ duces and legislates simultaneou sly, that labor and gove rnment are con joined within it? Which is an impossibil ity. Because since gove rnment on the one hand has the divergence of interests as its raisoll d'erre, and on the other -no resolution involving authority of majority being admissi ble-the people alone and without exception is competent to pass laws, then, as the debate attend­ ing legislation will be dragged out by the sheer numbers of the law-m akers , and since the affairs of State will be inflated as a direct consequence of the numbers of statesmen, there will be no time lef t over fo r citizens to attend to their industrial duties: it will take all of their time-and then some-to deal with the business of gover nment . There is no middle grou nd: one either works or one rules. ( .. . ) This, more over, is how things were done in Athens, where , over a number of centuries, save fo r a fe w intervals of tyran ny, the people as a body went to the public square to engage in discussions from morn ing to evening. But the 20,000 citizens of Athens who were sovereign, had 400,000 slaves to do the work fo r them, where as the French people has no one in its service and a thousand times as much business to transact as the Athen ians.

AWAY WITH AUTH ORI TY Is the principal, crucial idea of this revolution not, in eHeet-away with au­ thority, whether in the Church, the State, over the land, or over money? Now, no more authority means that one has never seen and never grasped the compatibility of the interests of the individual with the interests of all, the identity between collective sovereignty and sovereignty of the individual. No more authority! which is to say no more repayment of debts, the aboli­ tion of servitude, the lifting of mortgage s, farm rents returned, dues payable to church, courts and State all done away with; interest -free loans, free trade, freedom of association, fixed share prices; guaranteed inexpen sive education, work, property and housing; an end to antagonism, to war, to centralization, to government, to priests. Is that not society knocked otT its axis, working in reverse, turned upside down? No more authority! Which means free contract in place of absolutist law; voluntary compromise instead of State arbitrati on; equitable and reciprocal justice, instead of sovereign distributive justice; rational morality , instead of revealed morality; the balance offorces replacing the balance of powers: eco­ nomic unity instead of political cel ltralizatioll. Once aga1l1, is not that what I will venture to call a complete overhau l, a turn-ar ound, a revolution? One can get the measure of the gap between these two systems from the difference between their styles. One of the most solemn moments in the evolution of the authority principle was when the Ten Commandments were handed down. The voice of an angel commands the people prostrate at the foot of Mount Sinai: Thou shalt adore the Eternal one, and none but Him. Thou shalt swear by Him only. Thou shalt mark his feast days by idleness and thou shalt pay him His tithe. Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. ThOll shalt not commit fornication. Thou shalt do no wrong. Thou shalt not be covetous and bear no false witness . For this is the Eternal's ordinance, and it is the Eternal who has made thee what thou art.

The moderns do likewise ( . .. ) whatever the law, from whatever mouth it emana tes, it is sacred once it has been uttered by that fateful trum p which is, in our day, the majority. \"Thou shalt not gather together: Thou shalt not publish: Thou shalt not read: Thou shalt respect thy repre sentatives and the fu nctionaries whom the result of the count or the whim of the State will have given thee: Thou shalt obey the laws which their wisdom will have made for thee: Thou shalt faithfully pay thy taxes: And thou shalt love the gove rnment, thy lord and thy God, with all thy heart, all thy soul and all thy mind: because the government knows better than thee what thou art, what thou deserv est, what is approp riate fo r thee, and it has the power to punish those who offend against its commandmen ts, as well as to reward, even unto the fo urth generation, those whom it favors.\" o personality of man!

But the controversy goes a lot further back: and is heavy with implications fo r the future. For one thing it signals the opening of a breach between the working class and the stalwarts of bourgeois democ racy-its determination, more or less faltering as yet, to assert itself politic ally as a \"separate\" class; then again, it pits, one against the other, two contrasting views of worke rs' political action: anarchist abstention ism, and socialists' emancipation through the ballot box. When the imperial regime held gcneral elections on May 31 and June 1, 1863, there had been no consul tation of the electorate since 1857. On which occasion, although the support of the peasantry had been secured in the vast majority of provinces, in Paris the victory had none thele ss been a narrow one: the regime won by 110,536 votes as against the 96,299 fo r the democratic oppo­ sition. Five liberal deputies had thus been returned. They included Proudhon 's friend, Alf red Darimon. But Proudhon had stayed in the background, and, while the \"democrati c-socialist\" candidate owed his election to the prestige of his mentor, he had not, however, enjoyed his support. In 1863 Napoleon III had decided to consult the country once more , because what was described as the \"authoritarian Empire\" was afflicted by aging and venal ity. The despot also fe lt a need to revive a sham parliamentary life in tbe country and to bolster His Majesty's overly fragile opposition. In Paris, the results of the poll were celebrated by democrats who secur ed a quite consi derable majority: taking 153,000 votes in comparison with the Imperial authorities' 82,000. In France as a whole , 35 deputies from the opposition were returned to the legislature. According to Proudhon, at least half of those 153,000 votes had come from the work ing class. Yet no working man was elected. Of the nine candidates from the list of victors in Paris -of the democrats, six were journalists or mcn ofletters and three were lawyers. However, a worke rs' committee had been appointed with worker candidate s, including Henri Tolain, an engraver, who PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON 99"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"would very sh ortly figure among the founders of the First Internatio nal. In a memorable pamphlet entitled A Few Facts abollt the Paris Elections, Tobin offered this explanation: \"The loud voice of universal suffrage is all we have with which to make ourselves heard .... The people wants to govern itself. ... What can the people exp ect ... if it does not take its atTairs into its own hands?\" But the worker candidates won only a derisory number of votes (one got 332, another only 11: Tobin had withdrawn his candidacy a fair while before the election ). The bourgeois democracy looked upon these candidacies vvith such contempt that its spok esman, Jules Ferry, in his pamphlet The Elec­ tio11 Comest �f 1863, quite simply passed over them without a mention. Proudhon adopted tactics that were very much his own, the tactics of ac­ tive abstention. He \\vas the driving force behind an abstentionist committee whose activity was inteme: meetings, handbills, posters, all cr owned bv a cracking manifesto, and publication, on the eve of the election, of a pamphlet bearing his name and entitled Sworn Democ rats and Refractories. He was astute enough not to rehearse his anarchistic ideas on the topic and took care not to attack the very principle of universal suffrage \"the democratic principle par excellence.\" But, he reasoned, under the Empire, universal suffrage could not oper ate with complete independence, on a number of grounds which he went on to enumerate: the absence of freedom of assembly, of press freedom, and of municipal freedom . Electoral legislation tailored to suit the authori­ ties made a nonsense of the vote. Finally, and above all else, candidates were manipulated into pledging oaths ofloyalty to the Emperor. AgaillSt that backdrop, abstention was, as £lr as the voter was concemed \"a culpable gesture of indifference or sterile dignity,\" merely \"an act of conservation, an appeal to law and entitleme nt.\" It was \"an essential faculty of the voter.\" \"Part of electoral law.\" \"Merely a declaration by the country to the govemment that, in this context ... the voters' vote means that the head of the Empire renounces this dictatorship and simultaneo usly calls upon citizens to do their electoral duty and perform a true act of sovereignty.\" In passing, Proudhon was to shoot down recourse to plebiscite on tenden­ tious or deliber ately misconstrued issues, and his criticisms would be equally applicable under Gaullism: \"Abstention or silent voting ... are to be obliga­ tory, being the pre-condition , the prime and most sacred of duties, when the matt er put to the vote is equivocal, insidious, inopportune or unlawful.\" And Proudhol 1 concluded: 100 PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"From the present essa y and from the abstention committees ... it will be apparent that there exists an eli te that ... declines to vote . and which bases its refusal upon the fa ct that un iv ersal suf frage, fr ee dom's instrument and guarantee, would turn against it if the vote's guarantees were less than fu ll and its fi)fms less than sinc ere. But this language, which was in danger of seeming a touch aristo cratic , went unheeded by the popular electorate. In the Seine department, there were onl y 4,556 spoiled votes, and, across the country, \"passive\" abstenti ons, which had numbered 143,000 in 1857, plummeted to 86,000. However, the 4,556 spoiled votes thems elves far outnumbered the fe w hundreds cast fo r the worker candidat es. On March 20 and 21, 1864, there were fo llow-up elections. Once again Tolain placed a workers' candidacy before the electors of Paris-h is own-and this time he did not back out. He won only 424 votes. As in the previous year, the worker candidates had been sacrif iced to candidates fr om the bourgeois democr acy, who had two deputies retur ned. By way of backing fo r Tobin's candidacy, a 60-mem ber workers' committee had drafted a Manifesto . This is the text with which we open and which was to be passed down to posterity as the first public expression of the working class's consciousn ess. To begin with, Proudhon was enthusiastic as he read this docum ent. But a second glance diminished his ardor and praises. In his view, this arrival on stage by the \"worker plebs\" was \"at once a great victory and a great fa iling.\" He set out his reason ing in a book expressly writtel l fo r the occasion; publisbed in its unfinished fo rm a little after his death, it was his political testament, On The Political Capacity of the Working Classes. The authors of the Manifesto, Proudhon explained there , had not \"promoted and proposed the candidacy of one of their number other than on the basis of his worker status.\" Being a worker, they reckoned that he \"represented the working class better than anyb ody.\" The signif icance of this action did not elude the per­ spicacious Proudhon: \"Let me say that this gesture ... is indic ative in the working classes of a hitherto unprecedented revel ation , of its coop erative consci ousness: proof that half and more of the French nation has stepped on to the political stage , bearing an idea which, sooner or later, must transf orm society and government fr om top to toe .... Asocial phenomenon ofincol11parable transccndence has been made manifest inside society: the arrival in political life of the most numerous and poorest class, hitherto scorned as possessed of no consci ousness.\" PIE RRE-J OSEPH PROUDHON 101"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"But after paying that tribute, Proudhon nevertheless took issue ,yith the \"Sixty.\" Not unrea<;onably, he saw the 1�63-1864 elections as a \"real low blow,\" \"a sort of comedy laid on in order to buy time and harness the Revoluti on,\" \"the instrument of a political deal.\" It was senseless to enter the imperial system. Instead, what was required was a radical breach with the authoritie s. As for the democratic opposition, he was scathing: their candi­ dates made their ,tand \"on the terrain of imperial legality.\" \"They represent nothing, mean nothing and know nothing.\" The oppositi on's policy was \"in principle, its professed anti-socialism .\" The worker candida tes had made the mistake of holding out the olive branch to this opposition and of fering it their support. PA RIS , ONE ELE C TION EV ENING (J UNE I, 18 63) Monday, June 1, 1863, around ten in the evening: Paris is in the grip of a muffled agitation, reminiscent of that ofJuly 26, 1830 and February 22, 1848. However unmoved one might be by impressions on the streets, one would have thought oneself on the eye of a battle. On every side, Paris, returning to political life after a 20-year interval, was wakening from her slumbers, feeling herself alive, stirred by the breath of revolution. Ahl-cried those who had set themselves up as leaders of the movement ­ Paris right then was Monsieur Haussman 's new, monoton ous, tireSOIne city, with its ramrod-str aight boulevards and its gigantic hotels and magnificent but deserted quays with its sluggish river bearing only stones and sand to its railway stations which, in replacing the ancient city's gate s, have destr oyed its raison d'erre with her gardens, her new theaters , her new barracks, her tarmac, her legions of street-sweepers and her frightful dustiness. Thi s was the old Paris, whose specter appeared by starlight to booming cries of \"Long live liberty!\" Paris then, watchful guardian over the nation's freedoms, had arisen to the summons of her orators and answered the importuning of the government with the driest of rebuttals. Independent candidates had scored a formidable majority. The democratic list had been returned to a man; the results of the count were known. The administration had been defeated: its men had been rejected by some 153,000 votes to 82,000. The people, responsi ble for this cou p , mu lled over its success: the bourgeoisie had been split: one segment had indicated uneasiness, the other allowed its delight to erupt. 10 2 PIERR E-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"-Some coup! said one. What a slap in the face! -A serious business, added another. Very serious. Paris being with the opposition , the Empire has lost its capital. ... ( ... ) Then, on June 1, 1863, there was an eclipse of the mOOll. The sky was splendid, the evening magnificent. Tender and light, the breeze seemed to share the refreshing, not to say, harmless earthly emo tions. The whole of Paris was able to monitor the phases of the phenomenon which, having be­ gun at 56 minutes past nine-just as the polling booths were comple ting the count-was all over by 16 minutes past one in the morning. -Thus, opined the wits, is despotism eclipsed by liberty. Democracy has reached out its great hand and a shadow has fallen over the star of De­ cember 2: hierophant -like, M. Pelletier , one of those elected and today the parliament's most irritating orator as far as those who read his words or listen to them are concern ed, did not fail, in one of his pamphlets, to interpret the threat in this augury. -More a case, retorted the losers, of the eclipse of Paris's reason. It's a repeat of your fiascoes of 1830 and 1848, and it may well turn out worse for you than in 1830 and 1848! MAN IF ESTO OF SIX TY WORKER S FRO M THE SEINE DEP AR TMENT (FEB RUAR Y 17. 18 64) On May 31, 1863, the workers of Paris, more preoccupied with the oppositi on's victory than with their selfish interests, cast their votes for the list published in the newspap ers. Without hesitation, without haggling over their support and prompted by their devotion to liberty, they offered startling and irrefut­ able evidence of it. And so the opposit ion's victory was complete, just as had ardently been desired, but it was assuredly more overwhel ming than many had dared hope. A worker candidate was fielded, it is true, but championed with a modera­ tion that everyone was forced to acknowledge. Only secondary and partisan arguments were advanced in his defense, in view of an exceptional situation that afforded these general elections an especial character: his defenders re­ frained from raising the widespread problem of poverty. It was with a huge store of propaganda and arguments that the proletariat attempted to make its presence felt: the proletariat, that bane of modern society, even as slavery and serfdom were the banes of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Those who acted thus had foreseen their defeat, but they saw fit to blaze a trail. It seemed PIERRE -JOSEPH PROUDHON 10 3"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"to them that such a candidatur e was necessary if the profoundly democratic mentality of the great city was to prosper. In the forthcoming elections, the situation will no longer be the same. By having nine deputies returned, the liberal oppo sition has been largely grati­ fied in Paris. No matter who they were, selected on the same basis, the newly elected would add nothing to the import of the vote on May 31. Whatever their eloquence, it could scarcely add to the roar emanating today from the slick and sparkling words of the opposition's orators. There is not a single item of the democratic program that we would not be as eager as they to see realized. And let us state once and tor all: we employ that word, democracy , in its most radical and clear-cut sense. But whereas we are in agreement on policy, can the same be said of social econom y? The ref orms we seek, the institutions we demand and the freedom to found them, are these accepted by all who represent the Liberal Party in the legislative body? That is the rub, the Gordian knot of the situation. One fact offers a peremptory and painful demonstration of the difficulties attend­ ing the workers' position. In a country where the Constitution is founded upon universal suffrage, in a land where everyone invokes and advocates the principles of '89, we are compel led to justify worker candidates, to spell out in detail and at some length the hows and the whys, simply in order to ward off, not just unfair charges that we are faint-hearts and out-and-out conserva­ tives, but indeed the fears and misgivings of our friends. Universal suffrage has marked our coming of age politicall y, but we have yet to emancipate ourselves socially. In France, a democratic country, that liberty which the Third Estate was able to win with so much vigor and perseverance, must be extended to every citizen. Equality of political rights necessarily implies equality of social rights. It has been repeated time and time again: there are no classes any more: ever since 1789, all Frenchmen are equal before the law. But we who have no property beyond our arms, we who suffer, on a daily basis, the lawful or arbitrary conditions of capital, we who live under emer­ gency legislation such as the law on combinations and Article 1781 which in­ fringe our rights as well as our dignity, we find it ha rd to credit that claim. We who, in a country where we have the right to choose our deputies, still do not have the wherewithal to learn to read : we who, being unable to assemble or enter freely into association, are powerless to organize apprentice­ ship training, and who watch as that priceless tool of industrial progress turns 10 4 PIERRE- JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"into a privilege of capital, cannot afford to delude ourselves so. We whose children often spend their younger days in the degrading and unhealthy factory environment, or as apprent ices, which is at present simply a condition bordering upon slavery: we whose women-f olk are obliged to quit the home for overly demanding toil at odds with their natures and de­ structive of the family: we who have no right to come to some arrangement among ourselves for the peaceable defense of our wages, and to make provision against unemployment, we state that the equality written into the law has yet to pass into our mores and yet to be carried into practice. Those who, bereft of education and capital, cannot have recourse to liberty and solidarity to withstand selfish and oppressi ve demands, inevitably suffer the over-lordship of capital: their interests remain subordinated to other interests. That interests are not regulated, we know: they elude the law: they can only be reconciled through specific agreements as fluid and changeable as those interests themselves. Unless freedom is afforded to all, such reconci lia­ tion is not feasible. We will pursue the acquisition of our rights peaceably and lawfully, but vigorously and with persistenc e. Our emancipation would soon demonstrate the progress achieved in the mentality of the laboring classes, that countless vegetating multitude dubbed the proletariat, which, having recourse to an apter description, we shall call the wage slaves. To those who reckon that they see the organization of resistance and strike action in any demand on our part for freedom, we say: you do not know the workers: they pursue a goal much greater and more fecund than t ha t o f expending their dIorts in day-to- day stri f e in which the adve rsaries on both sides would ultimately achieve naught but ruination for some and misery for the rest. The Third Estate used to sa y: What is the Third Estate? Nothing! What should it be? Everything! We are not about to say: What is the worker? Noth­ ing! What should he be) Everything! But this we will say: the bourgeoisie, our senior in respect of emancipation, was, in '89, able to swallow up the nobility and eradicate unjust privileges; it is not for us to destroy the rights deservedly enjoyed by the middle classes, but rather to secure for ourselves the same freedom to act. In France, the democratic country par excellence, every political right, every social reform, every instrument of progress cannot remain the preroga tive of the few. By the very nature of things, the nation that has an innate sense of equality has an irresistible tendency to make that a universal inheritance.

We know that there is no talk of industrial, commer cial, milit ary, jou rnalist can didate s, et c., but the phenomenon exists even if the name does not. Does the vast ma jo rity of the legisla tive bod y not comprise great proprietors , industri alists, businessmen, generals , jo urnalists , et c., who tac itly vote or speak only in of fices and then onl y on issues in which they have a specialist interest? A very tin y number speaks out on broad issu es. To be sure, we think that workers elected should and would ch ampion the broad interests of democracy , but even if they were to confine thems elves to champio ning the secti onal interests of the most numerous class, what a specia lization that would be! They would sup ply a want in the legisla tive bo dy, where manual labor has no repr esent ation. We who have in our service none of these thin gs-no fo rtun e , no connections, no public of fice-are indeed obliged to give our candidates a plain and telling descr ip tion and to call thing s by their proper name ins ofar as we can.

No doubt, in the good old days, in the days of divine right, when, beiJlg imposed by God, kings and nobles thought thenlselves the fathers and elder brothers of the people, when happiness and equality were relegated to Heaven, charity had to be a social institution . In the age of popular sovereignty and universal suffrage, it is no longer such, and can now be nothing more than a private virtue. Alas! The vices and infirmities of human nature will always leaye plenty of scope for the exercise of brother liness: but undeserved misery, the sort that, in the form of sickness , inadequate pay and unemployment, traps the vast majority of well-intentioned working men in a hellish circle from which they strain in vain to break free: THAT misery, let us state emphatical ly, can be eliminated and will be. How come no one has made that distinction before? We have no wish to be clients or dependen ts: we wish to become equals: we reject alms: we seek justice. No, we are not represented, for no one has said that the spirit of antagonism is dail y growing weaker among the popular classes. Enlightened by experi­ ence, we bear no man hatred, but we do wish to alter things. No one has said that the law on combinations is only humbug these days and that, instead of eradicating the evil, kept it alive by barring every escape route to the man who believes himself oppressed. No, we are not represented, for, in the matter of trades councils, a queer confusion has taken root in the niinds of those who recommended them : ac­ cording to them, the trade council would be made up of employers and workers, a sort of professional panel, referees charged with deciding, day to day, UPOJl whatever matters may arise. Now what we ask is a council made up exclusive ly of work ers, elected by universal suffrage, a Trades Council along the lines, say, of the Chamber of Commerce, and, in reply, they give us a tribunal.

What better constituencies could be chosen than the first and the fifth' The prospects for success must be better there than anywhere else. The vote on May 31 has resolved the great issue of liberty beyond all chal­ lenge in Paris. The country is calm: is it not wise and politic to put to the test today the power of the free institutions which are to smooth the transition from the old society rooted in wage slavery to the society of the future which is to be founded upon common title' Is there not a danger in waiting until moments of crisis, when passions become unduly inflamed by widespread distress? Would not the success of worker candidates have an immeas urable moral impact' It would prove that our ideas are underst ood, that our feelings of concilia tion are appreciated: and that, at last, the refusal to implement in practice what has been acknowledged as fair in theory has ended. Could it be true that worker candidates would need to be possessed of those eminent oratorical and publicist gifts that single a man out for the admiration of his fellow-citizens? We think not. It would be enough for them to be able to appeal to justice, by spelling out plainly and clearly the reforms for which we ask. Moreover, would not the votes of their electors afford their words a greater authority than the most illustrious orator could claim? Springing from the ranks of the masses, the import of those elections would be all the more sensational in that those returned would have been the obscurest and most unknown off igures up until then. Finally, the gift of eloquence and universal expertise, have these ever been demanded as necessary qualifications of the deputies appointed hitherto? In lil48, the election of workers set the seal upon political equality: in 1864 such election would set the seal upon social equality. Other than by flying in the face of the evidence, one is forced to acknowl­ edge that there is a special class of citizenry in need of direct representation, in that the precincts of the legislative body are the only place where workers could worthil y and freely articulate their wishes and stake their claim to the 108 PIERR E-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"rights enjoyed by other citizens. Let us examine the current position without bitterness or pre judice. What does the democratic bourgeoisie want that we did not want along with it equa lly fe rvently? Univer sal suffrage without impedi ment of any sort? We want that. Freedom of the press , freedom of reunion, governed by a comm on entitlement? We want that. Complete separation of Church and State, a bal­ anced budget, municipal exem ptions? We want all that. Now then! But fo r our support, the bour geoisie would have a hard time securing or retaining these rights, these liberties, which are the very essence of a democratic society . What do we want more especially than it, or at any rate more sorely, in that we have a greater interest in it? Free and compulsory primary education and freedom oflabor. Education nurtures and reinfor ces the sense of human dignity, which is to say, awareness of rights and duties. The enlig htened man appeals to reason and not to force in the realiza tion of his desir es. Unless we have freedom oflabor by way of a coun ter-balance to freedom of trade, we will witness the emergence of a financial autocracy. The petit bour geois, like the worke rs, will soon be nothing more than its servan ts. Is it not apparent today that credit, far from beco ming widely acces sible, has instead a tendency to be conc entrated into a few hands? And does not the Bank of France offer a glaring exam ple of contradiction of every economic principle? It simultaneous ly enjoys a monopoly upon the issuance of paper money and a free hand in the unrestricted raising of interest rates. Without us, let us say again, the bour geoisie cannot establish anyth ing with security: without its backin g, our emancipation may be postponed fo r a long time yet. So, let us unite in a common object: the trium ph of true democ racy. Sponsored by us and backed by us, worker candidates would be living proof of the serious, enduring unity of democrats without regard to distinctions of class or position. Are we to be left to our own devices? Are we to be compelled to seck, alone, the triumph of our ideas? For everyo ne's sake, let us hope not. Let us recapi tulate, in order to avoid any misunderstanding: the essentiall y political import of the worker candidates would be this: A reinf orcement, a complement ing of the activity of the liberal opposition.

Today the ground is clear and since, as we see it, the necessity fo r worker candidates has been th rown into even sharper relief by what has happ ened in the interval, we have no hesitation in breaking new ground in order to fe nd off the reproach leveled at us in the last electi ons.

We are told that since '89, there have been no more classes: that the no­ tion of worker candidates tends to resurr ect them: that, if a work ing man is accepta ble as a candidate, just the way one would accept a sailor, an engineer, a scholar, a journalist, a lawyer, this is because that working man will, like his colleag ues, repre sent socie ty and not a specific class: that, otherwise, the fielding of this working man would be a step backwar ds, an illiberal, even a dangerous move , by virtue of the misgi vings, the alarm, the hostility that it would inspire in the bour geois class. Such is the logic of the advers aries of the Manif esto, who do not even real­ ize that they contradict themse lves. But, as I see it, it is precise ly on account of its specific character , and as the manifestation of one class or caste- for I do not recoil from the word-t hat worker candidature has value: stripp ed of that, it would be meaning less. What! Is it not a fact that, in spite of the Revol ution, French soc iety is profoundly split into two classes: one, which lives exclus ively by its labors, and whose wages are generally less than 1,250 francs annuall y, for a family of fo ur, a sum that I take to be the rough average of the national product: another, which lives of f something other than its labors , assuming that it does work , and lives off the income from its propertie s, capital, endowm ents, pensions, subsidi es, shares, salaries , honors and stipends? Is it not a fact that, in terms of the division of wealth and prod uce, there are still, as once there were , two categories of citizen among us, commonly described as bour g­ eoisie and plebs, capitalism and wage slavery? But the whole of our political organization, political economy, industrial organization, history, literature and society repose upon that distinction which only bad faith and a fo olish hypocrisy seem to deny. Society's division into two classes -one class of waged workers , another of proprietor s-capitalists-en treprene urs-the refore enjoying indis putable de PIER RE-JOSEPH PROUDHON III"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"facto status, the implications of that ought not to come as a surprise to anyone : it is that there has always been some question as to whether that distinction did not also have a de jure existence: whether it fe ll within the province of nature, compatible with justice: whether it might not be possible to bring it to an end, which means contri ving some amalg amation of the classes: in short, whether, by means of improved implementation of the laws of justice and economic s, one might not succes sfully do away with a dismal distinction which every man would wish at heart to see eradicated? That quest ion, scarcely a new one, is what has been described in our day as the social question: it is the whole and all of socialism. Well, now! What say the Sixty? They, fo r their part, are convi nced that the social question can be resolved in an affirmati ve sense: with moderation and firmness, they note that fo r quite some time, it has been stricken from the agenda, that the time has come to re-ta ble it: to that end, and as a signal or earnest of that resurr ection, they propose that one of them stand as a can­ didate: that, by virtue of his being a working man and precise ly because he is a working man, they reckon that he can represent the working class better than anyone else. And these men are accused of designs upon the re-establishment of castes? Some would have them barred as reactionarie s, professing dang erous opin­ ions, from representation of the nation , and their Manif esto has even been denounced as inciting some citizens to hate their fe llow-citizens! The press thunders , the supposedl y democratic opposition shrieks its displeasur e, and there are cries of importuni ty and recklessness and what not. Ther e are dark hints about the police ! With a show of consu mmate disdain, the question is posed whether the Sixty would claim to know more about their interests and their rights, and about defending them, than Mess rs]. Favre, E. Ollivier, Pellet an , ]. Simon, etc. C Contem ptible . Thus far at any rate, I am quite in agreement with you, citizens, and with the Sixty , and it is gratif ying that not fo r a single mome nt did you imagine that I could fe el differently than yours elves. Ye s, class distinction enjoys a de ja cto existence in our democratic Franc e, and it has yet to be proved entir ely that this phenomenon is rooted in entitleme nt, albeit that there are no grounds fo r imputing it to anyone. Yes, except fo r 1848, national representation h as been the preroga tive of one of those classes: and. unless the representatives 112 PIERRE-JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"drawn from said class make a prompt commitment to effect the fusion sought, justice, common sense and universal suffrage require that the second of those classes be represented like the other, in proportion with its population fig­ ures. In mooting that ambition, the Sixty are not in any sense insulting the bourgeoisie, are not threatening it, but are standing up to it like the youngest son to his older siblings. ( . . . ) Such language, as candid as it is modest, ought to reassure the faintest of hearts: and the bourgeoisie, the middle class especially, would be ill-ad­ vised to be alarmed by it. Whether it knows it or not, its true ally, its savior, is the people. So let it with good grace concede the workers' entitlement to national representation and not, I say again, merely as citizens and despite their worker status, but rather on the basis that they are workers and members of the proletariat. That said, let me move on to the second point. Whether, in the present circumstan ces, exercise of the eligibility right is indeed, as far as the working class is concerned, the best way of bringing about the ref orms for which it sues, whether such a conclusion on the part of the Manifesto does not conflict with the aim its authors have set themselves, whether it is not at odds with their principles: in short, can socialism, under the current regime, do what it managed to do in 1848 without injury to its dignity and faith? Men of some import in the democracy, whom no one ever suspected of compromise with the enemy, who themselves refrained from voting, nevertheless reckoned it their duty, out of sympathy with the working class and by way of testimony to their distancing themselves from an opposition which was misunderstood, not to oppose the workers' decision and to wish their candidature well. While acknowledging sentiments in which I share, I regret that I can make no such concession, and on this count, I take issue with the Sixty. Consider this: the imperial government, established by coup d'etat, identifies as the prime cause of its success its def eat of red socialist democr acy, that to this day that is still its raison d'etre, which it has never overlooked that in its policy, and that there is at present nothing to indicate that it has any inclination nor indeed capacity to change. Under that government, the financia l and industrial fiefdom, long incubated over the thirty three years of the Restoration and the July monarchy, has completed its organization and climbed into the saddle. It has supported the Empire, which has rewarded it for its sponsorship.

The Republic, through the introduction of universal suffrage, provided Democracy with a moment of effervescence, but the conservative aristocr acy soon recaptured the upper hand, and, come the coup d'etat, it might be said that power was a foregone conclusion for the side that had best used the reaction against the socialist tendenc ies. On which basis we may say that, under the regime that has ruled over us since 1852, our ideas, if not our persons, have been, so to speak, placed outside of politics, outside of government, outside of the law. To none but us has access to the periodical press, the preserve of the old parties, been denied. Whereas sometimes a proposition inspired by our principles was put to the authorities, it quickly foundered-I know of what I speak-when rebuffed by contradictory interests. Confronted with a state of affairs where our destruction is the salvation of society and property, what can we do but accept our reprobation in silence, and, since the government has ventured to impose this draconian condition , separate ourselves radically from it? Entry into its precincts, where we may be sure to find all our enemies, old and new, defectors to the Empire and non-def ectors, ministry folk and opposition folk, embracing the prescribed condition s, seeking representation in the legislative body-that would be an absurdity, an act of cowardice' All that we are permitted to do under the exist­ ing law is register a protest in great elections, through the negative content of our bulletins. Bear this in mind-that in the system of compression by which democracy is oppressed, it is not such and such a financial measure, such and such an undertaking, such and such an expenditure, such and such an alliance, such and such a treaty, policy or law that we must debate: they have no need of us for that: our opinion is ruled null and void in advance. Such debates are the preserve of the constitutional opposition, friend or foe. For there is room for every view but ours in the Constitution: can you doubt it, after the brouhaha that erupted everywhere after publication of the Manifesto' Now, in order to exercise our separatism, we need neither representatives nor candidates: in legal terms, all we require is a single word, veto, the most vigorous message that universal suffrage can deliver. Let liS clarify our thought with a few example s: May we, by word of mouth, in writing, or through the actions of men authentically ours, pledge fiddity to the 1852 Constitution, to which we see all 114 PIERRE -JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"our enemies, Legitimists, Orleanists, ex-Repu blicans, clericals agog to pledge themselves? No, we cannot, for that oath, injurious to our dignity, incompatible with our principles, would imply apostasy on our part, even should we remain, as so many others have after their oath, the personal enem ies of the Emperor. The Constitution of '93, by enshrining the sovereignty of the people, swept away the civic oath required under the '91 Constitution to these three terms: Nation, Law and King. Let Napoleon follow that example and then we shall see. Meanwhile, no representati ves and no candidates! There are some who say that the pledge imposed upon deputie5 is mean­ ingless: that it is not binding upon the maker, provided that, in the act of making it, he understands that his pledge is being made, albeit under the name of the Emperor, to the nation: that. furthermore, the pledge does not imply any support for imperial policy. Finally, that it is not for electors to overcome this scruple. which is a matter of concern to the candidates only. In bygone times. the Jesuits alone possessed the secret of salving consciences: Has that secret now been passed down to the E cole Normale? Such moralists, no matter how high their reputation for virtue may stand, ought to be deemed the most infamous human creatures by the socialist democr acy. So. no representatives and no candidates! Just now, I referred to the periodical press monopoly introduced and especially directed against us. From the outcom e of the May elections. we know what it cost us to have had a week's dalliance with it. Do you think that abolishing ministerial authorization would be enough to do away with that monopoly? Then you are well wide of the mark. We want neither hide nor hair of a regime that has been depraving our political morals. misrepr esenting ideas and misleading opinion for 12 years now. Authori zing such corruption of the public mind-be it for six months, for a day, or through the election of a socialist deputy-would amount to declaring ourselves accomplices of that corruption and unworthy ever to be heard. So, no represent atives and no candidate s! We want no conditions upon the exercise of universal suffrage, and why? Not just because natural population clusters ha ve been subverted by arbitrary constituency boundaries: we leave it to the Imperial government' s competi­ tors to bleat while they await their chance to imitate it. Nor is it because of adminis trative interference either. In meetings summoned to decide the government's fate, those who rail loudest against such interference are careful to say that, in the minister's shoes, they would not refrain from it.

To call for the emancipation of the plebs and then to consent, in the plebs' name, to a method of election which is tantamount to rendering it seditious or dumb. What a paradox! So, no representatives and no candidates! Note, citizens, that in all of this I am sticking to politics alone and deliber­ ately steering clear of economic and social considerations. How many further arguments I could adduce against this candidatures f.1ntasy, which would assuredly not have possessed the pe ople, had we been able in time to explain this proposition, the truth of which you are doubtless starting to discern: that an opposition vote is one thing, a protest vote another and a duly recorded constitutional vote, bearing the stamp of the returning officer another, and a democr atic and social vote quite another. In May 1863, the people thought it was voting for itself and as sovereign: it voted only for its bosses and as client. As for the rest, I know that by now you have no illusions left: the worker candidates, if my sources are accurate, say as much themselv es. So, what good are representativ es! What use are candidates? Everything that has been done since November 24, 1860, in govern­ ment and in oppositi on, indicates a reversion to the regime of 1830, with the sale modifica tion that the title of emperor is to replace that of king, and the Bonaparte dynasty replace that of the Bourbons. Leaving to one side the dynastic issue, with which we need not concern ourselves, can we democr ats lend a hand with this about-turn? It would be a betrayal of our past to worship that which we have put to the torch, or put to the torch that which we have worshipped. Now, that is necessa rily what must happen if we let ourselves be represented in a legislative body, among an opposition three fourths of which have come around to the idea of a constitutio nal, bourgeois monarchy.

This will help them get to grips with the thing: It is axiomatic that in a coun try racked by revolutions such as ours is, suc­ ceeding government s, although their slogans may chang e, still close ranks against a third party, and take turns at the duties imposed upon them by this redoubtable inheritance. Now, that is a condition which, should the oppor­ tunity arise, we are prohibited from accepting. We-the outla ws of 1848, 1849 and 1852-cannot agree to the undertakings , deals and all the acts of power devised with an eye to our exter mina tion. That would amount to a betrayal of ourse lves, and the world should know that. At present , the public debt, consolidated and outstanding, with growth rates at three percent, stands at 14 thousand 600 millions. So much for the financial expre ssion of charges accrued since 1789 and be­ queathed to one after another of our various governmen ts. It is the plainest and most clear- cut product of our political systems , the most splendid bequest to pos­ terity of seventy five years of conservative , bourgeois rule. l f need be, we would assume responsibility tor that debt up until 24June 1848: but we are within our rights to repudiate it afterthat. And since it is unacce ptable that the nation should be declared bankrupt, it would be up to the bour geoisie to pay off the residue. We await its decision. So, citizens, no repre sentati ves and no candidates! In the Manif esto of the Sixty, there is an unfortuna te choice of term s. In politics, they profess to be in agreement with the opposition: this is an unduly large concession, inspir ed by the generous intention of bridging, in part at least, the gulf separating democracy from its representati ves, and it must be put down to a slip of the pen. In all sincerity , we can no more be happy with the opposition 's politics than with its economic and social ideas: if the latter be mistaken, how could the fo rmer be above reproach? The opposi tion's politics is not the criticisms which parties fling at each other regardi ng their actions , such as the Mexican expedition, the state of Algeri a, the swelling budget, etc.: nor is it the banal demonstrations in favor of freedom, the philan thropic jeremiads , the sighs heaved over Poland, or the more or less explicit support for the trade agreement. On all such matters of pure detail , we shoul d have our reservations about the opposition's criticisms , not just as soc ialists and comm unists, but as politicians and democra ts. The opposition 's politics is above all its declared anti-socialism, which necessaril y places it in the reactionary camp against us. Messrs . Marie and Jules Favre have said as much, in the opening debate, and in a tone never to PIER RE-JOS EPH PROUDHON 117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"be forgotten: \"We are no socialists'\" At which words the entire Assembly erupted into applause: not a single voice was heard to object. So \\ve are within our rights to say that, on the very principle of their politics, members of the so-called democratic opposition are in agreement with the government: they outdo the government itself in their anti-socialism: how could they fail to become ministers some day? The opposition's politics is its love for parliamentarislll, which will draw it willy-nilly into a bloc with the imperialist majority, under the 1830 arrange­ ment: it is its enthusiasm for centralization and unification that shines through all its speeches, in spite of all its declaiming about municipal freedoms and sycophancy towards Parisians. Remember, a high degree of centralization alone can satisfy high ambitions and you will notice that, should France ever have the misfortune to find opposition personnel summoned to take their turn at overseeing this much-cherished centralization. The opposition's politics is its constitutional dynastic oath: it is the solidarity with the actions of the government to which it consents, if only by drawing its deputy's stipend; it is the compliments, the praises, the thanksgiving which it mixes with its criticisms, the share it claims of its successes and glories. The oppositio n's politics is its conduct in the May 1863 elections . When we saw it, once it had usurped the oversight of the count, trampling suffrage underfoot, fielding everywhere candidates utterly i rrec on cilable with the spirit of the Revolution, showing itself to be more scheming, more tyrannical, more corruptive than the administr ation, against which it then strove to focus the public revulsion, so as to whiten its own record.

What, then, has this rigorous action produced? 1. A thunderous declaration from Messrs. Marie and Jules Favre: \"We are no socialist s!\" Yes!

The lamentable result of the oath. The democracy, led by its new tri­ bunes, fo ndly imagined that the oath of obedience to Napoleon III, and of fidelity to the 1851 Constitution, could not but be a sublime perjury on the lips of its repre senta tives. It was intoxicated with this notion, and it has sadly deceived itself. Our sworn deputies will no more have the courage to breach their oath than to keep it. Can you see them beating about the bush, sustai ning heavy losses, swimming between the waters of treachery and fidelity? Traitors to democracy when in cahoots with the Empire, traitors to the Empire when closeted with democ racy. Privy counci lors and table companions of His Maje sty, are still more honest and less hypocritical. Thanks however to this policy , the Restoration of the Orleanist system, with M. Thiers at the helm, is visibly underw ay. M. Thiers and his cronies, positing monarchy as, in princi ple, essential fo r the organiza tion of power, and declaring themse lves to be, by virtue of the very same princi ple, indiffe rent as to the dynasty chosen, that being a simple question of personalities according to them, are perfect ly at horne here. Nothing prevents them from taking the oath, and the more that Napoleon affords them cause to keep it, the more content they are . Also, since the taking of all these oaths, a matter of such high significance and import fo r the Orleanists, but which the country can watch democ rats do only with disgust, the party of constitutio nal, parliamentary monar chy has bounced back comple tely: supported by the weightiest and most enlightened fa ction of the Bonapart ists, it believes that its victory is assured: it has secur ed over the Repub lican party the only advantage it has retained since 1852, the advantage of logic and political honest y. 3. The conclusion to this deplorable intrigue? Democ racy, the prepon­ derance of which should have been estab lished once and fo r all by the 1864 poll, momentaril y hailed as sovereign fo llowing the election of the new incu mbents, now no longer matters , pending the advent of new order, except as the instrum ent of a political re-plastering job, against which our every effort must henceforth be deployed in defend­ ing ourselves.

Our success has been splendid enough for us not to lose heart: At first we told ourselves: In our own right and allte-dating the 1852 constitution , we have the right to vote. We have the right to vote or not to vote. If we vote, we are free to choose between the administr ation 's candi date and the opposition 's candidate, just as we are to protest against each by select­ ing a candidate of a hue opposed to them both (which is what the authors of the Manif esto propose ). Finall y, we have the right to protest against election orany sort, either by depositing blank votes or by voting fo r some citizen who would not meet all of the criteria fo r eligibil ity, who, say, might not have taken the oath, if in our jud gment electoral law, as practiced, does not offe r sufficient guarantees fo r universal suffrage, or on any other grou nds. The point, therefore, was to find out what would be the most useful way for us to vote. Those who have argued that the vote must necessarily desig­ nate a candidate , that universal suffrage by itself was bereft of meaning, and that it de rived all of its value from the choosing of a man-those people have overwhel med the public, and they have lied. We have opted then for the protest vote, by means of blank vote or equiva­ lent, and this was the outcome: Out of 64 departments we have been able to monitor, there were 63,000 protest votes-4 ,556 of them in Paris: proportionall y speaking, that makes around 90,000 for the whole of France. We would have numbered 100,000 in Paris and a million across the 89 departmen ts, had we been allowed to make our voice heard and explain our thinking.

They might have sunk them all, and the government might have been left all alone with its elected deputies, facing a pro testing democracy , had the monopoly press not smothered our voice.

Would we be less informed as to our financial situation, the European situation and electoral strengths and so many other matters about which the government and its friends are so wont to prattle, simply because we might not have heeded the pleas of a half-dozen lawyers? Would it not be a thousand times better for democracy's honor and its future prospects, had we left the government to debate with its own represent atives and to wash its dirty linen at home, as Napoleon I used to say, than to have besmir ched our conscien ces, hitherto unblemished by oath?

COMMUNISM\" I Here, ill retrospat, Proudholl attacks the type of State and \"communi stic\" socialism preached b y Louis Blanc during the 1848 Revolution fro m the so-called Luxem b ourg Commission. 2 COLLE CTIVE SOV EREIG NTY In essence, the Luxembourg system is the same as those of Cabet, R. Owen,3 the Moravi ans, Campanella, More, Plato and the earliest Christians: a com­ munist, governmental, dictatorial, authoritarian and doctrinal system. It starts from the premise that the individual is essentially subordinate to the group, that his rights and his very life derive from that alone, that the citizen belongs to the State, the way the child does the family, that he is in the power, the possession, in manll, of the State and owes it full submission and obedien ce. By virtue of that underlying principle of collective sovereignty and sub­ mission of the individual, the Luxembourg school tends in theory and in practice to relate everything to the State-or the community. Work, industry, property, commerce, public education and wealth, as well as law-making, the courts, police, public works, diplomacy and war-they are all turned over to the State for subsequent assignment and distribution, in the name of the commun ity, to every citizen, member of the wider family, in accordance with his aptitudes and needs. The first movement and first thought of labor democracy, in seeking out its law and offering itself as the antithesis of the bourgeoisie, must have been to throw its maxims back in its face; this is strikingly evident from a first glance at the communist system. What is the principle underlying the old, artisanal or feudal, post-revolu­ tionary or divine right society? Authority, whether descended from Heaven or deduced from the nation as a whole as Rousseau does. The communists in their turn have spoken and acted thus. They trace everything to the rights of the collective, the sovereignty of the people: their concept of power or of the State is absolutely identical to that of their former masters . Whether it goes by the name of empi re, State, monarchy, republic, democr acy or com­ munity, the thing is self-evidently the same throughout. For followers of that school, the rights of man and the citizen derive from the people's sovereignty: even liberty itself is an emanation from that.

The communists abide by that-as far as they also are concerned -the individual is indebted for his assets, his faculties, his honors and even his talents, to the State. The difference lay in implementation only. For a reason or out of necessity, the ancient State had loosened its hold: a host of noble or bourgeois families had stepped out of the primitive indivision and they have formed tiny sovereign­ ties within the larger one. Communism's object was to reincorpor ate all such fragments of its in­ heritance into the State. Under the Luxembourg system, society's democratic revolution was to be merely a restorat ion, which is to say, a step backwar ds. Thus, like an army which has captured the enemy's guns, communism merely turned their own artillery against the army of proprietors. The slave has always aped his master ( .. . ) ON ASSO CIA TI ON When it comes to methodology, quite aside from the public order authority to which it does not yet have access, the Luxembour g party settled upon and preached association. The idea of association is a new one in the world of economi cs: the divine right states, ancient and modern alike, are the ones that have launched the mightiest associations and supplied the theories for them. Our bourgeois legislation, (the civil code or commercial code) has adopted many of their categories and concepts . What have the Luxemb ourg theorists added to that? Absolut ely nothing. For them, association has very often been merely common ownership of assets and earnings. Occasiona lly, it has been construed as simple partnership or cooperation, or indeed a collecti ve or share-ho lder compan y. Labor associations have more often been taken to be mighty, numerous companies of workers subsidized, comma nded and directed by the State, which draw in the bulk of the working class, enjoy a monopoly of works an d undertakings, meddling in every industry, all farming, all trade, every office and all ownership, leading to a vacuum in private establishments and under- 12 4 PIERRE- JOSEPH PROUDHON"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"takings, and fi nall y overw helming and crushing every individual in itiative, all private prope rty, all lif e, all liberty and all wealth, precisely as the great limited com panies are doing toda y.

The February revolu tion broke out. As soon as I disco vered that there was fighting unde rway in Paris, I borrowed a passport from a person of my acquain­ tance, by way of preparing for any eventual ity, and set off for Paris. But the passport proved useless: \"The Republic has been proclaimed in Paris\" -those were the first words we heard uttered at the border. The news sent a shiver down my spine: I arrived in Valenciennes on fo ot, the railway line having been destr oyed: there were crowds everyw here, shouts of enthu siasm, red flags on every street, in every square and on every public building. I was obliged to make a detour, the railway being impassa ble in a number of places, and I arrived in Paris on February 26, within three days of the proclama tion of the Republ ic. Even on the way there, I relished it all. That huge city, the fo cus of Europ ean culture, had suddenly been turned into a savage Cauca sus: in every street, virtu ally everywh ere, barricades towered like mountains stretching to the level of the roof-tops: atop these barricades, amid the rubble and broken fu rniture , like Geor gians in their gorges, were workmen in picturesque smocks, blackened with dust and armed to the teeth: fat grocers-f aces rendered stupid by fright-p eered fe arfully from their windows : there was not a single vehicle on the streets or in the boulevards : gone was all the old smug ness, all the odious, monocled, wise-cracking dandies and in their place, my noble working men, triump hant, enthused crowds brandishing red flags, singing patriotic anthems and intoxicated by their success. And amid this unbounded rejoicing, this intoxication, they were all gentle, humane , compassionate, decent, modest, well-mannered, fr iendly and high-minded to a degree possi ble only in France and there, only in Paris. There after and fo r over a week I lived alongside these workers in the barracks in the Rue de Toumon, right next to the Luxembourg Palace; that barra cks, previou sly reserved fo r the municipal guard, had now, like man y another , been turned into a republican stron ghold servin g as a billet for Caussidiere' s MIKHAIL BAK UNIN 129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"army. I had been invited to move in there by a democrat friend of mine who was in command of a detachment of 500 working men. Thus I had occasion to see the workers and to study them from morning to evening. Never and nowhere , have I discovered in any other class of society so much high-minded unselfishness, nor so much truly touching integrity, delicacy of manners and light-hearted friendliness married with heroism as among those simple uneducated folk who have always been and will ahvays be worth a thousand times more than their leaders! Especially striking about them was their profound sensibility to discipline: in their barracks, established order, laws and constraints were out of the ques­ tion: but would to God that any regular soldier could obey with as much precision, and divine as well the wishes of his officers and maintain order as strictly as these free men: they asked for orders and asked for leadership, eagerly obedient to the merest detail; in their onerous service, lasting whole days at a time, they endured hunger and still their friendliness was undimin ished and they were still light-hearted. Had these folk, had these French working-men been able to find a leader worthy of them, capable of understanding them and taking them to his heart, that leader might have accomplished miracles with them. ( . .. ) That month spent in Paris ... was a month of intoxication for the soul. Not only was I intoxicated, but so was everybody else: some from a crazed fear, others from a crazed ecstasy of senseless expectat ions. I rose at five o'clock or four o'clock in the mornings, went to sleep at two o'clock, was on my feet all day long, attending every assembly, meeting, club, parade, march or demonstration: in short, I drank in the intoxication of the revolutionary atmosphere through every one of my senses and through every pore. It was a fiesta without beginning and without end: I saw everyone and saw no one, fo r every individual was subsumed into the same, coun tless, me­ andering crowd: I spoke to everybody but could remember neither my own words nor others', for my attention was at every step held by new events and objects, by unforeseen developments. This widespread feverishness drew a modicum of sustenance and reinforce­ ment from news coming in from other parts of Europe: all one could hear was comments such as the following: \"There is fighting in Berlin: the king has fled after having made a speech!

In short, the state of mind was such that, had someone turned up and announ ced: \"God has just been driven out of Heaven and a Republic proclaimed therein,\" everybody would have believed him and no one would ha ve been surprised in the slightest. And the democrats were not the only ones to succum b to this intoxication. Quite the contrary: they were the first to come to their senses again, obliged as they were to set to work to consolidate power that had fallen into their lap against all expectations and as if by miracle . The conservative party and dynastic opposition, (the latter having become, overnight, more conservative than the conservatives themselves)-in short, all of the men of the old regime- believed even more than the democrats in every seeming miracle and far-fetched development: they had even stopped believing that two plus two make four and Thiers himself had declared: \"There is but one option open to us now, namely, to seek oblivion.\" That fact alone explains the alacrity and unanimity with which all the provincial towns and every class in France recognized the Republic .

Conseq uently, we join James Guillaume' s biography oj Bakunin at that point only: ( ... ) When the Polish uprising erupted in 18 63, he [B akunin ] attempted to reach the activists leading it: but the orga nization of a Ru ssian Legion fa iled, and Lapins ki' s expedition came to nothing: and Bak unin, who had gone to Sto ckholm (where his wif e jo ined him) in hope of getting the S\\vedes to in tervene, had to return to Lon don (in Octob er) without having succeeded in any of h is ven tures . He then traveled to Ital y, fr om where , in mid -1 864, he made a second trip to Sw eden: he returned via London, where he called again on Marx, and Paris, where he paid another call on Proudho n. In the wake of the war of 18 59 and Gar ibaldi 's heroic expedition in 18 60, Ital y hadj ust begun a new lif e: Bakunin sta yed in the country until the autumn of 186 7, staying first in Florence and then in Naples and its en virons. He had devised a plan fo r a secret international orga niza tion of revoluti onaries, with an eye to propaganda, and, when the time came, to action, and fr om 1864 onwar ds, he managed to recruit a certain number of It alians, French, Sc andi­ navians and Slavs into that secret soci ety , wh ich he dubb ed the \"I nternational Brother hood\" or the \"A lliance of Socialist Revol utionar ies.\" In It aly, Ba kunin and his fr i ends applied themselves in a particular way to com ba ting the Mazzinians ,l who were author itarian, rel igious republ icans whose watch word was Dio e popolo (God and pe ople) . A newspaper, Liberia e Giustizia, was launched in Naple s: in its col umns, Bakunin spelled out his program. In Jul y 18 86, he inf ormed Herzen and Ogaref r of the existence of the secret socie ty, briefing them on its program, by which his two old fr iends 132 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"were, as he himself admitted, \"greatly shock ed.\" At that point, according to Bakunin, it had supporters in Sweden, Norwa y, Denmark, England, Bel­ gium, France, Spain and Italy, and also numbered Poles and Russians among its memb ership. In 1867, bour geois democ rats from a number of countries, mainly French and Germans, launched the League of Peace and Freedom, and summoned a congress in Geneva that caused a sensation. Bakunin still clung to a fe w illu­ sions regarding democrats; he attended the congr ess, where he made a speech, became a member of the League's central committ ee, established his home in Switzer land (near Vevey) and, over the ensuing year, strove to steer his fellow committee members towards revolutionary socia lism. At the Leag ue's second congress in Berne (September 1868), along with some cronies who belonged to the secret organization fo unded in London in 1864 ... he attempted to have the League pass blata ntly socialist resolu tions, but after a few days' proceed­ ings, the revolut ionary socialists, being in a mino rity, announced that they were quitting the League (on September 25, 1868), and on the very same day, they launched a new grouping under the name of the International Alliance of Socialist Democ racy, with a program drawn up by Bakun in. That program, encapsulating the conclusions at which its author had ar­ rived at the end of a protr acted evolution that had begun in the Germany of 1842, stated, among other things: The Alliance proclaims itself atheis t: it seeks the defi nitive and com plete elimination of classes, and political, economic and social equality fo r persons of both sexes: it wants the land, the instrum ents of labor, as well as all other capital , having be come the collec tive property of the whole of society , to be availa ble only fo r the use of toilers, which is to say, of agricultural and ind ustrial assoc iations . It acknow ledges that all the existing political and authoritarian States, being reduced progres sively to sim ple fu nctions in the adminis tration of public services in their respec tive coun tries, will have to melt into a worldwide union of fr ee associations. agricultural and ind ustrial alike. With its establishment, the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy had testified to its desire to be a branch of the International Workingmen's Associa tion, whose general statutes it accepted. September 1868 had seen the appearance in Geneva of the first issue of Na rodnoye Dyelo, a Russia n newsp aper written by Mikhail Bakunin and Nikolai MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 133"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Zhukovsky; it published a program entitled \"Program of the Russian Socialist Democ racy,\" which was essentiall y identical to the program that the Interna­ tional Alliance of Socialist Democracy was to adopt a few days later. But the paper had a change of editorial staff from the second issue onwards and came under the control of Nikolai Outine,3 who gave it a quite different slant. The International Workingmen's Associa tion had been launched in London on 28 September 1864, but its organization was not finalized and its statutes not adopted until its first congress was held in Geneva between September 3 and 8, 1866. While passing through London in October 1864, Bakunin, who had not seen Karl Marx since 1848, had had a visit from him; Marx had called on him for the purpose of of fering an explanation of the calumn y\" once published by the Ne ue Rheini sch e Zeitu ng and put back into circulation by some German journalists in 1853. At the time, Mazzini and Herzen had come to the defense of the libeled Bakunin who was incarcerated in a Russian fortress: on that occasion, Marx had stated once again in the English ,Hornin g Ad verti ser that he had had no hand in that libel, adding that Bakunin was a friend of his, and he repeated as much to Bakunin. In the wake of their conversation, Marx had encouraged Bakunin to join the Internation al: but once back in Italy, Bakunin had thought it better to devote himself to the secret organization mentioned earlier; apart from the General Council in London, the Internation al, in its beginnings, represented little more than one group of mutualist workers in Paris, and there was noth­ ing to hint at the importance that it was about to assume. It was only after its second congress in Lausanne (September 1867), after its two court cases in Paris and the great strike in Geneva (1868) that the association attracted serious attention and became a power whose role as a lever of revolutionary action could no longer be ignored. At its third congress in Brussels (September 1868), collectivist ideas were mooted, in competition with cooperativism. In July 1868, Bakunin was inducted as a member of its Geneva branch and, once he had quit the League of Peace and Freedom at its Berne congress, he settled in Geneva in order to be in a position to take an active hand in that city's labor movement. Immediately propaganda and organizing ac tivity were given a great fil­ lip. A trip to Spain by the Italian socialist Fanelli5 led to the foundation of branches of the International in Madrid and Barcelona. The francophone branches in Switzerland came together into a federation that took the name 134 MIK HAIL BAK UNIN"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"of the Feder ation romand e and had a mouth piece of its own in the newspap er U']l3.g alitc, launched in January 1869. The battle was then joined with phon y socia lists who were hobbl ing the movement in the Swiss Jura, and this ended with a majority of Jura workers coming over to revol utionary socialism . On several occas ions, Bakunin traveled to the Jura to speak on behalf of those fighting against what he termed \"reaction wearing the mask of cooper ation\": this was the origin of the friendshi p that he struck up with the militants of that region. In Geneva itself , a dispute between the instinc tively revol ution­ ary socialist construction workers and the so-ca lled \"manuf acturing\" watch­ makers and jewelers eager to partici pate in election campaign s, was resolved thanks to Bakunin, who campaigned vigorousl y from the pages of L'YEg al ite and there, in a series of remar kable article s, he spelled out the program of the \"policy of the International,\" on the basis of the regretta bly ephemeral success of the revolut ionary element . The Internatio nal's sections in France, Belgium and Spain acted in concert with the francophone Swiss section, and it was anticipated that at the next general congress of the Association, collec tivism would be carried by a majority of votes. The London- based General Council had refused to admit the Interna­ tional Alliance of Socialist Democracy as a branch of the International, on the grounds that the new society represented a second international body and that its presence within the International would have a disorganizing effect. One of the grounds fo r this decision was Marx's anim osity towards Bakunin, in whom the illustrious German comm unist believed he saw a \"schemer\" keen to \"turn the International upside down and turn it into a tool in his hands \" : but, independently of Marx's personal fe elings , the fact is that the idea of launching a second organization alongside the Internation al was an unha ppy one, as Bakunin 's Belgian and Jura friends indicated to him: whereupon he yielded to their persuasion and recognized that the General Counc il's decision had been right. As a result , the Allian ce's central bureau, after consultation with the organiza tion's membership, announced, with their agreernent, that it was being disbande d: the local group that had been set up in Geneva became an ordinary branch of the International and was recognized as such by the General Council (July 1869). At the fourth general congress in Basle (September 6-12, 1869), virtu­ ally every one of the Internati onal's delegates came out in favor of collec­ tive ownership: but it was app arent that there were two distinct schools of thought among them : some, the Germans, the German-s peaking Swiss and MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 135"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the English were State communists; others , the Belgians, the francophone Swiss, the Spani ards and virtuall y all of the French were anti-authoritarian communists, or federalists, or anarchists, who called themselves collectiv ists. Bakunin, of course, belonged to the latter gronpi ng, as did the Belgi:m Dc Paepe and the Parisia n, Varlin, among others .\" ( ... ) The secret organization launched in 1864 had been wound up in January 1869, following an internal crisis, but several of the mem bers of it had kept in touch with one anothe r, and their band offriends had been joined by a few new Swiss, Spanish and French recruits, of whom Varlin was one; this fr ee assoc iation of men who combined into a revolutionary broth erhood fo r collec­ tive action must, one might think, have afforded greater strength and cohesion to the great movement of which the International \\vas the expres sion. In the summer of 1869, a fr iend of Marx's had reprinted in the Ber­ lin Lukutljt the old chestnut that \"Bakunin \\vas an agent of the Russian gover nment,\" and Liebkneche had repeated the allegation on a number of occasions. When Liebknecht visited BasIc fo r the congr ess, Bakunin invited him to explain himself before a panel of honor. There. the Saxon socialist stated that he had never made any allegations about Bakunin but had merely repeated sOll1ething he had read in the press. The panel agreed unan imously that Liebknecht had acted with culpable frivolousn ess and fo rwarded to Bakunin a written statement carrying the signatures of the panel- mem bers; Liebknecht, acknow ledging that he had been in err or, offered his hand to Bakunin, and, in everyone's presenc e, the latter burned the panel's statement , lighting his cigarette with it. After the congress of Basle, Bakunin left Geneva and withdrew to Lo­ carno (Tessill) ; he had been prom pted to do so by considerations of a strictly personal character, one being the need to settle somewhere where the cost ofliying was cheap and vvhere he would have the peace and quiet to devote himself to the translation work he intended to do on behalf of a St. Petersburg publisher (initiall y, this consisted of translating the flrst volume of Marx's Das Ka p ital, which had appeared in 18(7). But Bakunin 's departure from Geneva unfortunately left the gate open fo r political schemers who, by associating thems elves with the chican ery of a Russian emigre , Nikolai Outine, only too well known for the part he played in the International tor us to hang a label on hil1l here, they succeeded \\vithin a few months in throwing the Gene va branch of the International into disar ray and in gaining the upper hand and taking over the editing of U'lEJ<illitc. 136 MIKHAI L BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Marx, blinded completely by his resentment and petty jealousy with regar d to Bakunin, had no hesitation in allying himself with Outine and the pseudo­ socialist clique of Geneva politicos, men of the \"Temple Uniq ue.\"8 While, at the same time, in a Confidential Bulletin circu lated to his friends in German y (March 28, 1870), he did his best to ruin Bakunin in the eyes of German socialist demo crats, by representing him as the agent of a Pan- Slavist party, from which, Marx alleged, he received an annual stipend of25,000 francs. The scheming of Outine and his Geneva confederates contri ved to pro­ voke a split in the Federation romande: the latter split (April 1871) into two factions, one of which, by common agreement with the Internationalists in France, Belgium and Spain, had come out in favor of the revolu tionary policy, stating that \"any working class participation in governm ental bour ­ geois politics cannot but result in the conso lidation of the existing order of thing s\"; whereas the other faction spoke up fo r \"political intervention and worker candidate s.\" The General Council in London. as well as the Germans and the German Swiss, sided with the latter faction (the Outine and Temple Unique faction), while the French, the Belgians and the Span iards sided with the other (the Jura faction). At that point, Bakunin was quite engrossed in Russian matters. As early as the spring of1869, he had come into contact with Netcha yev:\" at that time he still belie ved that it might be pos sible to organize a sweeping peasant uprisi ng in Russia .... It was then that he penned, in Russian, the appeal kllo'vvn as A Few Wo rds to Yo ung Friends in Russia and the pamphlet SciCl1ce and the Rev olut ion­ ary Cause To day. Netcha yev had returned to Russia, but had had to flee once more following the arrests of almost all his friends and the destruction of his organization, and by January 1870, he was back in Switzer land. He insisted that Bakunin drop his transl ation of Das Kapital in order to devote himself wholly to Russian revolutionary propaganda .... In Russian, Bakunin wrote the pamphlet To the OJficer s oj the Russian Army and, in French, the pamphlet The Bear s oj Berne and the Bear oj St. Peter sbur g; he also brought out a fe w edi­ tions of a fresh run of Kolokol10 and was tremendou sly busy fo r some months; but in the end, he realized that Netcha yev was intending to use him as a mere pawn and was resorting to Jesuitical measures in order to secur e himself a personal dictatorship. Following a definitive show-down in Geneva in July 1870, he severed all connect ions with the young revol utionar y. His unduly trusting nature had been abused, as had the admiration he had at first fe lt fo r Netcha yev's mave rick vigor. \"Needless to say,\" Bakunin wrote to Ogaref f MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 137"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"(August 2, 1870) in the wake of this falling-out. \"we nude complete fools of ourselves.

To his socialist friends in Lyon he wrote: The patriotic movement of 1792 is nothing by comparison with the one you must now mount, if you would save France. So arise, friends, to the sOllnd of the Marseillaise, which, today, is once again France's legitimate anthem, aglow with relevance, the anthem of liberty, the people's anthem, the anthem of mankind, because France's cause is again, at last, mankind's cause. Bv playing the patriotic card, we will salvage the world's freedom. Ah, if only I were a young man. I would not be writing letters. I would be in your midst! A contributor to Volksstaat (Liebknecht's newspaper) had written that the workers of Paris were \"indifferent to the present war.\" Bakunin was outraged to find them credited with such criminal apathy: he put pen to paper to show them that they could not remain impervious to the German invasion and simply had to defend their freedom against the armed hordes of Prussian despotism: Ah, \\'.-ere France invaded by an army of proletarians-Germans. English, Belgians, Spaniards. Italians-displaying the colors of revolutionary socialism and proclaiming the Ii nal emancipation of labor to the world, I would have been the wry first to cry out to France's workers: \"Welcome them with open arms, for they are your brothers, and join forces with them to sweep away the putrefying remnants of the bourgeois world!\" But the invasion by which Frallce is dishonored today is an aristocratic, monarchical and military invasion. By staying passive in the face of this invasion, French workers would not only be 138 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"betraying their own freedom, but would also be betraying the cause of the proletariat the world over, the sacred cause of revolutionary socialism. Bakunin's thoughts on the situation and the means by which France and the cause of freedom might be saved were set out by him in a short pamphlet which appeared, uncredited to any author, in September, under the title Let­ ters to a Frenchman on the Current Crisis. On September 9, 1870, Bakunin left Locarno to make his way to Lyon, ar­ riving there on September 15th. A \"Committee for the Salvation of France\" had been set up and he was its most active and most daring member, immediately making preparations for an attempt at a revolutionary uprising: that movement's program was made public on September 26 through a red poster bearing the sig­ natures of delegates from Lyon; Saint-Etienne, Tarare and Marseilles: although a toreigner; Bakunin had no hesitation in adding his signature to those of his friends, claiming his share of their danger and responsibility. After having an­ nounced that \"having become impotent, the administrative and governmental machinery of the State has been abolished\" and that \"the people of France were reverting to complete self-possession,\" that poster moved that committees for the salvation of France be formed in every federated commune and immediately despatch two delegates from the committee of every departmental capital \"to join the revolutionary Convention for the salvation of France.\" A popular revolt on September 28 left the revolutionaries in possession of the city hall in Lyon: but treachery on the part of General Cluseret and the cowardice of some of those in whom the people had placed its trust aborted this attempt; Bakunin, against whom the procurator of the Republic, Andrieux, had issued an arrest warrant, successfully reached Marseilles, where he went into hiding for a time, while trying to put another revolt together: meanwhile, the French authori­ ties were peddling the rumor that he was a paid agent of Prussia, and that the government of National Defense had proof of this: for its part, Liebknecht's Volksstaat carried these lines with regard to the revolt of September 28 and the program set out in the red poster: \"The press bureau in Berlin could not have done a better job of furthering Bismarck 's purposes!\" On October 24, despairing of France, Bakunin left Marseilles aboard a ship whose skipper was friendly with friends of his, returning to Locarno via Genoa and Milan.

The revolt that erupted in Marseilles on October 31, seven days after Ba­ kunin left, merely confirmed him in his gloomy assessment: the revolutionary Commune that had set itself up in the city hall when the news came ofBazaine's surrender, was only able to survive for five days and abdicated on November 14 in favor of commissioner Alphonse Gent, Gambetta's envoy. Back in Locarno where he spent the whole winter in isolation, grappling with material discomfort and black misery , Bakunin wrote, by way of a se­ quel to his Letters to a Frenchman, a review of the new situation in Europe: it appeared in the spring of 1871 under the telling title The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution. News of the Parisian uprising on March 18 came as a partial rebuttal of his gloomy prognost ications, demonstrating that the Parisian proletariat at least had retained its vigor and spirit of rebellion. But the heroics of the people of Paris were to prove powerless to galvanize an exhausted and defeated France: attempts made in several provincial loca­ tions to propagate the communalist movement failed, and the brave Parisian insurgents were overwhelmed by superior numbers. And Bakunin, who had arrived among his friends in the Jura (April 27) so as to be closer to the border with France, had to make his way home to Locarno Oune 1) without having had the opportunity to act. This time, though, he was not disheartened. The Paris Commune, the target of hatred from all of the concerted reactionaries, had lighted a glimmer of hope in the hearts of all victims of exploitation;11 in the heroic people which had shed its blood in torrents for the emancipation of mankind, the world's proletariat saluted, as Bakunin phrased it, \"the modern Satan, the great rebel, beaten but not broken.\" The Italian patriot Mazzini had added his voice to those cursing Paris and the International; Bakunin wrote an Internatiorzalist's Answer to Mazzini that appeared in both Italian and French (August 1871): that essay had a tremendous impact in Italy, and among the youth and work­ ers of that country, it brought about a shift in opinion that, before 1871 was out, had led to the creation of numerous branches of the International.

The split inside the Federation romande, which might have been resolved amicably, had the General Council in London so desired, and had its agent, Outine, been less treacherous, had worsened and gone beyond remedy now. In August 1870, Bakunin and three of his friends had been expelled from the Geneva branch for having indicated their support for the Jurassians. In the immediate wake of the war of 1870-1871, agents of Marx arrived in Geneva to reopen old sores: the membership ofthe Alliance branch thought that they were offering proof of their peaceable intent by announcing that their branch was being wound up, but the Marx-Outine camp did not disarm: a new branch, the so-called revolutionary socialist propaganda and action chapter, launched in Geneva by refugees from the Commune and which the erstwhile members of the Alliance branch had joined, was refused admission by the General Council. Instead of a general congress of the International, the General Council, led by Marx and his friend Engels, summoned a secret conference in London in September 1871: it was comprised almost exclusively of Marx loyalists with whom the latter had arrived at decisions that did away with the autonomy of the International's branches and federations, awarding the General Council an authority that flew in the face of the Association's fundamental statutes: at the same time, the conference sought to organize, under General Council auspices, what it termed \"the working class's political action.\" As a matter of urgency, the International, a wide-ranging federation of groupings organized for battle on economic terms against capitalist exploitation, had to be spared the overlordship of a tiny coterie of Marxist and Blanquist sectarians. The Jura sections, in concert with the Geneva-based propaganda branch, came together in Sonvilier on November 12, 1871 into aJura Federation, and issued a circular to all other federations of the Interna­ tional, inviting them to join with it in resisting the trespasses of the General Council and in vigorously reasserting their autonomy. \"The society to come,\" the circular read, \"should be nothing other than the universalization of the organization with which the International will MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 141"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"have endowed itself. So we should take care to assimilate that organization as closely as possibly to our ideal. How could one expect an egalitarian and free society to emerge from an authoritarian organization? That would be an impo ssibility. It is incumbent upon the International, being the future hu­ man society in embryo. to stand here and now as a faithful reflection of our principles of liherty and federation and to eschew from its ranks any principle tending towards authority and dictatorship.\" Bakunin gave an enthusiastic welcome to the Sonvilier circular and thre\\v himself wholeheartedly into spreading its principles around the Italian sections. Spain, Belgium and most of the branches reorganized in France in defiance of the Versailles backlash, as secret chapters, and most of the branches in the United States took the same line as the Jura Federation: and the thwarting of the attempt by Marx and his allies to establish their domination over the International was soon assured. The first half of 1872 was marked by a \"Confidential Circular \" from the General Council; it was written by Marx and published in a pamphlet entitled Fhe Alleged Splits ill the illtcYIlati(mal. In it, the main militants of the autonomist or federalist camp were personally attacked and libeled, and the protests that had erupted on all sides against certain actions of the General Conncil were represented as the products of intrigues mounted by members of the late International Alliance of Socialist Democracy. These, under the direction of the supposed \"mysterious pope of Locarno,\" were alleged to be working to destroy the International. Bakunin summed up this circular as it deserved when he wrote to friends: \"The sword of Damocks vvith which we have for so long been threatened has just fallen on our heads. It turns out to be not so much a sword as Mr. Marx's usual weapon, a pile of rubbish.\" Bakunin spent the summer and autumn of 1l:S72 in Zurich, where (in Au­ gust), at his instigation, a Slav branch was launched that was made up almost exclusively of Russian and Serbian male and female students: it affiliated to the International's Jur::t Federation. From April onwards, he was in touch from Locarno with a number of young Russians living in Switzerland and had organized them into a secret action and propaganda group .... Friction with Petr Lavrovl2 and differences of opinion alllong a few members were to lead to the winding up of the Slav section in Zurich in 1873. Meanwhile, the General Council had decided to summon a general con­ gress for September 2, 1872: but as the venue for the congress, it selected The Hague, the better to be able to field, from London, large numbers of delegates 142 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"equipp ed with courtesy or fictitious mandat es, all of them com mitted to the Council 's policy, and to make access to the congress all the more difficult fo r delegates from more remote federations and impossible fo r Bakunin.

The case made by Marx and his supporters in requesting, after a deris ory sham inquest held in camera, that Bakunin be expelled, rested upon the fo llowing two arguments: That proof exists, in the form of draft statutes and letters signed Bakunin, that that citizen tried and perhaps was successful in founding in Europe an organi­ zation by the name of the Alliance, with statutes wholly different in social and political viewpoint from those of the International Workingmen's Association: that citizen Bakunin has had recourse to fraudulent procedures designed to appropriate to himself all or part of someone else's fortune, which amounts to embezzlement: that, furthermore, he or his agents have had recourse to intimidation in order to evade honoring their commitments. It was that latter part of the marxist indictment, with its allusion to the adva nce of 300 rubles Bakunin had received fo r the translation of Das Kapi­ tal, and to the letter written by Netcha yev to the publisher Poliakov, that I described earlier as an attempted moral assass ination . A protest at such infamy was immedia tely made public by a group ofRus­ sian emigres: here are the essential passages fr om it: Geneva and Zurich, October 4, 1872-At our friend Mikhail Bakunin, they have dared to hurl the charge of embezzlement and blackmail.

Wh en he saw the Internation al reorga nized on the basis of the victory of the principle of free federa tion, he reckoned that the time had come when he might take his leave of his colleagues, and to the members of the Jura Fede ration he addr essed a letter (published on October 2, 1873) requesting that they accept his resignation as a member of the Jura Federation and of the Internati onal. He added: I no longer feel that I have the strength required for the struggle: consequently. I could only be a burden upon the proletariat's camp and not a help.

The so-call ed nationali ty princi ple, as posited in our day by the governme nts of France, Russia and Prussia, and also by many German, Polish, Italian and Hungaria n patriots, is merely a by-product which the reaction uses as a counter to the spirit of revolution : at bottom eminen tly aristocratic, even to the extent of scorning the dialects ofilliterate populations, implic itly refuting the freedom of provi nces and the effective autonomy of comm unes, and backed in every count ry, not by the mass es of the people, whose real interests it system atically sacrifices to a suppo sed public good, which is never anything ot her than the benefit of the privileged classes, this princ iple articulates nothing except the alleged historic rights and the ambition of State s.

Which is why this notorious incompati bility and this strife between personal interests and society's interests are noth ing but trick ery and a political lie, sprung fr om the theological lie that concoc ted the doctrin e of origi nal sin in order to bring man into dishono r and destroy whatever consciousness of his own self-worth he may have had, That very same coun terfeit notion of antagonistic interests was also incu­ bated by the dreams of metaphy sics which, as we know, is a close cOllsin of theology.

But whereas the metaphysicia ns, espec ially the ones that believe in the im mortalit y of the soul, assert that men are, olltside of society, free beings, the inevitable conc lusion from that is that men can only combine into society on condition that they forswear their freedom, their native independence and 170 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"sacrif ice their interest s, personal interests to begin with, and then their local ones. The imperviousness of such renunciation and sacrifice of itself must be, ipso fa cto, all the greater according to the increase in society's numbers and the com plexity of its organization .

Enjoying such an abstract, and at the same time violent , existenc e, it carries on, needless to say, making greater and greater trespasses against individual libert y, in the name of the lie that goes under the name of \"the public good,\" although, self-eviden tly, it repre sents only the interest of the ruling class. In this man ner, the State appears to us an inev itable negation and annul ment of all liberty and every interest, whether personal or gener al. It can be seen here that in metaph ysical and theological systems ever ything is connected and self-explanat ory. Which is why the logical defenders of these systems may and indeed should, with an easy conscience, carry on expl oiting the masses of the people through Church and State. Lining their own pock ­ ets and indulging their every sordid whim, they can at the same time take consolation from the thought that their labors are fo r the glory of God, the victory of civiliza tion and the eternal happiness of the proletariat. But we who believe neither in God nor in the immortality of the soul, nor in fr ee will proper, we contend that liberty ought to be understood in its com pletest and widest sense as the goal of humanit y's historical progre ss.

People cannot countenance the notion of independence from one another, without turning their backs on the recipr ocal influence of the interweaye of manif estations of external nature. Within natur e herself, that marv elous warp and weft of phenomena is certai nly not achieved without tension. Quite the opposi te. The harmo ny of natural forces emerges only as the authent ic product of that continual tension that is the very essence of life and movement. In nature as in society, order in the absence of struggle amounts to death. If order is natu ral and feasible in the universe, that is only because that universe does not functio n according to some preconceived system imposed by an over-arching will. The theological supp osition of divine ordinance leads to a self-evident absur dity and to negat ion, not just of all order , but of natu re itself Natural laws are only real insofar as they are inherent in nature, which is to say, insofar as they are not ordained by any authority. Those laws are merely manifestations or fluid modali ties of the develop ment of things and of combinations of these greatly varied, ephemeral but real phenome na. Taken all together, they constitute what we call \"nature.\" The human intellect and science took note of these phenom ena, eXJrnining them experim ental ly, then codifi ed them into a system and called them laws. But natur e herself is above laws. She opera tes unco nsciously, being herself a represe ntation of the infinite variety of phenomena, inexorab ly manifesting themselves and repeating themselv es. Which is why, thanks to such inexorability of action, universal order can exist and, in effect, does exist. Such order also appears in human society, which, apparently, evolves in a so-ca lled anti-natural fashio n, but which in fact is subject to the natu ral, inevitable progress of phenome na. Except that man's superiority over other animals and his capaci ty for thou ght introduce a special (and, let it be said, quite natural in this sense, that like every living thing, man represents the material product of the marri age and opera tion of pheno mena ) ingred ient into its development.

Failing to comprehend the nature and material causes of their own thoughts, not cogniz ant even of the conditions or natur al laws particular to them, the first men to live in society could assuredly not have suspected that their absolute notions were merely products of their capacity fo r conceiving abstract ideas . Whi ch is why they took the view that those ideas , derived fr om nature, were real phenomena before which nature itself would cease to count for anything. Whe reupon they set about worshipping their fictional creatio ns, their impos sible notions of the absolu te, and rendering every honor to them. But somehow a way had to be devised to make the abstract notion of nothingness or Godhead sensible . To that end, they inflated the concept of divinity and also endowed it with every good and bad quality and attribute which they had only ever encountered in natur e and in socie ty. So much fo r the origin and historical development of all religions , starting with fe tishism and ending with Christiani ty.

It is common knowledge that superstition has alwa ys given rise to frightf ul misfortunes and compelled the spilling of rivers of blo od and tears . Let us sa y only that all of these revo lting vagaries of poor humankind were historical phenomena inevita ble in the cour se of the normal g row th and evol ution of social organ isms. Such vagaries spawned in society the fatal notion, enthroned in men's imaginations, that the universe was supp osedly governed by a supernatural fo rce and will.

After which, any society was impos sible unless it boasted these two institutions as its fo undations: Church and State. These two social scour ges are defended by all doctrinar ians. These institutions had scarcely arrived in the world before two castes were suddenl y organized : that of the priests and that of the aristocrats, who, MIKHAIL BAK UNIN 173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"losing no time, took care to inculcate deeply into the enslaved populace the indispensabili ty, usefulness and healthine ss of Church and State .

But did the priests and aristo crats honestly believe in the institutio ns that they supp orted with all their might and with particular advantage for them­ selves? Were they simply liars and decei vers? No. My belief is that they were , at one and the same time, belie vers and impos tors. They too were believers because they share d, naturall y and inevitably, in the viciss itudes of the masses, and it was only later, at the time of the demise of the ancient world, that they turned skeptics and shamel ess deceivers . There is another basis on which we may regard the fo unders of States as honest fo lk. Man always readily belie ves in whatever he \\vants and whatever does not run counter to his own intere sts. It matters not if he is intelligent and well- edu­ cated: out of self-regard and a desire to live alongside his neighbors and enjoy their respect, he will always have fa ith in whatever he finds agreeable and servicea ble. I am convinced that, sav, Thiers and the Versailles govern ment strove at all costs to persuade themselves that by killing a fe w thousand men, women and children in Paris , they were saving France. But while the priests, augurs, aristocrats and bourg eois, in ancient and in recent times, might well have been sincere believers, they were nonetheless sycophan ts. Indeed, it is unthinka ble that they should have credited every one of the absurdities which go to make up fa ith and politics. I will not so much as mention the days when, as Cicero has it, \"two augurs could not look at each other without laughing.\" Even in the days of ignorance and wide spread superstition, it is hard to imagine the inventors of miracle s, day in and day out, having believed in the authen ticity of those miracle s. The same may be said of politics, which can be encapsu lated under the fo llO\\ving axiOln: \"The people must be subjugated and fleeced in such a fa shion that it does not com­ plain too loudly about its fate, that it does not fo rget to submit and that it has not the time to turn its mind to resistance and rebellion.\" How then, after that, could we imagi ne that fo lk who have turned politics into a profession and are co nversant with its object, which is to say, injustice, violence, fa lsehood, treachery, murder -m assive and individual -ca n have :1l1y honest belie f in the art of politics and in the wisdom of the State as pro­ vider of social happiness) For all their cruelty, they cannot have grown silly to that degre e.

On that score, history is brimf ul of lessons: the horrif ying guillotine of 1793, which could scarcely be accused of slothf ulness nor of slugg ishness, fa iled to eradicate the nobility of France as a class. The aristoc racy , while not com­ pletely destr oyed by it, was at least prof oundly shaken , not by the guilloti ne, but by the confisca tion and sale of its assets . And as a general rule it may be said that political blood baths have never killed off parties: above all, they have shown themse lves to be po werle ss against the privileged classes, such is the extent to which power resides not so much in men as in the positions awarded to men of privilege by the organ ization of things, which is to say, the insti tution of the State and its imp lications as well as its natural basis, private ownership.

Assured of a majority which they had been long in building and orchestrated with much skill and care, if not with much regard for the principles of morality, truth and justice which are so readily encountered in their speeches and so rarely in their deeds, the marxians have cast aside their mask and, as behooves men enamored of power, as ever in the name of that sovereignty of the people which is henceforth to serve as stepping stone for all pretenders to governance of the masses, they have daringly proclaim ed the enslavement of the people of the International. Were the International less lively, had it been founded, as they imagine, only upon the organization of directing centers, and not upon the real solidarity of the effective interests and aspirations of the proletariat of every country in the civilized world, upon the spontaneous and free federalization of workers' sec­ tions and federations, indepen dently of any government tutelage, the decrees MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 189"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"emanating fr om this noxious congress in The Hague, the all too comp laisan t and loyal embodi ment of marxian theories and marx ian practic es, would have been suffici ent to do it to death.

The popes at least coul d plead the absolute truth which they claim ed to hold in their hands through the grace of the Holy Spirit and in which they were required to believe . Mr. Marx cannot enter that plea, and I will not do him the injury of supposing that he imagines that he has scientificall y devised something appr oaching absolute truth . But, as soon as the absolute is ruled out, there can be no in fa llible dogrrta where the International is concerned, not by rcason of political theor y nor by virtue of fo rmal economi cs, and our cong resses ought never to lay claim to the role of ecum enical councils enun­ ciating princi ples binding upon all members and believers .

The marxians and we are at one on this score . But immediate ly there arises the matter which so profoundly separates us from the marxians . Our reckon ing is that the, necess arily revolu tiona ry, politics of the prole­ tariat should have as its sole and immediate object the destruction of States. We cannot understand how there can be talk of international solidarity when there is this desire to pres erve States, unless the referen ce is to the universal State, which is to say, universal slavery. Like the great emperors and popes, the State, by its very natur e, is a breach in that solidarity and thus a standing cause of war. Nor can we com prehend talk of freedom of the proletariat or true deliverance of the masses within the State and by the State. State signi­ fies domination, and all domination implies subjection of the masses, and as a result, their exploitation to the advantage of some governing mino rity. Not even as revo lutionary transition will we coun tenance national Con­ vent ions, nor Constituent Assemb lies, nor provisional gover nmen ts, nor so­ called revolu tionary dicta torsh ips: beca use we are persuaded that revo lution is sincere, honest and real only among the masses and that, when ever it is concentrated in the hands of a few governing individ uals, it inevit ably and immedi ately turns into reaction. Such is our belief , but this is not the time to expand upon it. The marxians subscribe to quite contrary ideas . As befits good Germans, they worship the power of the State, and of necess ity also the prophets of political and social disci pline, the champions of order established from the top down , always in the name of universal suffrage and sovereignty of the masses, who are marked down fo r the privilege and honor of obeying leaders , elected masters. The marxians ackno wledge no other emancipation than the one they expect from their so-cal led people's State (V olkss taa t) . They have so little enmity fo r patriotism that their International even flies, all too often, the colors of Pan-Germanism. Between Bismarck's politics and marx­ ian politics there is doubtless a very palpa ble difference, but betw een the marxians and us there is a yawning gulf. They are governmentals and we are anar chists, come what may. Such are the two main tendencies which have the International at present divided into two cam ps. On the one side, there is only, strictly speaking, Germany: on the other, there are, to varying degree s, Italy, Spain, the Swiss Jura, much of France, Belgium, Holland, and, in the very near future, the Slav peoples. These two tendencies clashed at the congress in The Hague and, thanks to Mr. Mar x's great deftness, thanks to the quite contrived organization of its latest congr ess, the Germanic tendency has carried the da y.

And even if he had entertained such a mad hope fo r a moment , the closing of ranks by the Jura, Spanish , Belgian and Dutch delegates (not to mention Italy which did not even deign to send its delegates to this congr ess, which was all too blatantly rigged) , a protest so moderate in fo rm but essential ly all the more energetic and telling, must have quic kly disabused him.

By popular gove rnment the marxians mean government of the people by means of a small number of representatives elected through universal suffrage. Election by the nation as a whole of so-called people's repre sentatives and State leaders, which is the latest device of the marxians as well as of the democratic school of thought, is a lie that shrouds the despotism of the leading minority, a lie all the more dangerous because it is peddled as expressing the supp osed will of the people.

But this mino rity, the marxians argue, will be made up of work ers. Yes, to be sure, offormer workers who, as soon as they become the people's governors and representati ves, will stop being workers and will begin to look down upon the proletarian world from the heights of the State: they will then repre sent, not the people , but them selves and their ambitions to govern it.

Bakunin 's text contains nothing to startle . It is in fa ct quite consistent with the line he adopted in his earlier writi ngs. In it one finds the distil latio n of libertarian socialism. By contrast, there is more to surprise in the Address drafted by Marx on behalf of the General Council of the workers' InternationaL to which marx­ ians and Bakuninists alike belonged at the time.

For that reason, it diffe rs noticea bly from Marx's writings of before and after 1871, and compares exceptionall y well to Bakun in's writings.

The State is to administer and direct cultivation of the land through its appointed en­ gineers commanding armies of rural workers organized and disci plined fo r such cultivation.

Everyone is to be equal, not just before the law and politi­ cally, but in economic terms too. That, at least, is the promise, although I very much doubt that, given the manner in which it is tackled and the course intended, the promise can ever be honor ed.

Thus, in a fo reword (dated June 24, 1872) to a new edition of the Ma nif esto, they conceded that \"in man y respects, \" they would now \"rephrase\" the passage in question from the 1848 text. And, remar kably, they cited in support of any such redrafting \"the practical experie nces, first of the February [1848] revol ution, then, to a much greater extent, of the Paris Commune, when , fo r the first time, the proletariat held political power in its hands over a two month period.\" And concluded: \"All of which means that, in places, this program is no longer up to the minute. The Commune in particular has supplied proof that the work ing class cann ot rest content with taking possess ion of the existing machinery of the State in order to place it in the service of its own aims .\" The 1871 Address also anno unces that the Comrn une is \"discovered at last, MIKHAIL BAK UNIN 199"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"the political fo rmula whereby the economic emancipation of labor can be brought about.\" In his Life if Karl Marx, Franz Mehring, an undi sputed marxist, has himself stressed that the 1871 Address fe ting the Paris Commun e was, on this score, somewhat of an amendm ent to the l'vfanifesto, where elimination of the State had indeed been considered, but only as a long-term proce ss. Later, though , Mehring assur es us, after the death of Marx, Engels, by then grappl ing with anarchist tenden cies, had jettisoned the amendm ent in question and reverted to the old ideas in the Manifesto.4 The fact remains that the rather abrupt \"about -turn\" by the author of the 1871 Addr ess must have aroused skepticism from Bakunin. Speaking of the Comm une, he wrote: \"So fo rmid able was its impact everywhere that the marxians themse lves, all of whose ideas had been overthrown by that insur ­ rection, fo und themse lves obliged to doff their hat to it. They went fu rther: flying in the face of si mple logic and their true fe elings, they proclaimed that its program and its aim were theirs. It was a truly absurd travesty, but a nec­ essary one. They had been fo rced into it, on pain of finding themselves cast aside and deserted by everybody, such was the extent of the passion aroused by that revolu tion in all and sundry .\"5 And Bakunin observ ed: \"It appears that at the congress in The Hague [September 1872], Mr. Engels, taking fr ight at the despica ble impr ession pro­ duced by the reading of a fe w pages from that Manifesto, had wasted no time in declaring that it was a superseded docum ent, a theory which they [Marx and Engels] had since abandoned . Ifhe said that, he was less than honest, fo r, on the very eve of that same congres s, the marxians had striven to dissemin ate that docum ent throughout every country.\"\" As fo r James Guillaum e, Bakun in's disciple fr om the Jura, he reacted in similar terms to a reading of the 1871 Addr ess: \"This is an aston ishing state­ ment of princ iples, where Marx appears to have jettiso ned his own program in order to come over to fe deralist ideas. Does that mean a real conversion by the author of Das Kapital, or at least a temp orary seduction to which he suc­ cumbed under the pressur e of even ts? Or was it a ploy on his behalf, designed to reap, through appar ent support fo r the Commune's progra m, the benefits of the prest ige attaching to its name?\"7 In our own day, Arthur Lehning, to whom we are indebted fo r the erudit e edition of Archives Bakounine currently being published, has stressed the contra­ diction between the ideas in the Address and all of Marx's other writings: 200 MIKHAIL BAKUN IN"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"\"It is an iron y of hist ory that at the very moment when the strug gle between the authoritarian and the anti-a uthori tarian tendencies was reaching its peak [inside the First Interna tional] , Marx, reeling fr om the tremendous im pact of the revol utionar y uprising of the Parisian proleta riat, articulated the ideas of that Revolu tion, the very opposite of the ideas fo r which he stood, and in such a way that they might almost be described as the program of the anti­ authoritarian tend ency against which he fo ught [inside the Interna tional] with tooth and nail ( ... ) There is no doubt that the brillian t Addre ss of the General Council ( ... ) does not fit in at all with the elaboration of the system of 'sci en­ tific socia lism'.

BAKUNIN: THE PARIS COM MUNE' (. . .) In the Paris Commu ne, revolutionary socialism has just essayed its first spec­ tacular, practical venture. I am a supporter of the Paris Commune which, though it has been massacred and smothered in blood by the henchmen of monarchist and clerical reaction, is all the livelier and more potent in the imaginations and hearts of Europe's proletariat: I am a supporter of it because it was a well artic ulated and daring rebuttal of the State. It is an historical fact of immense implications that this rebuttal of the State should have manifested itself specifica lly in France, which has hitherto been par excellence the home of political centralization, and that Paris specifically, the center and historical creator of this great French civilization, should have been the one to take the initiative in this. Paris, yielding up her crown and enthusiasticall y announcing that she was stepping down in order to bring liberty and life to France, Europe and the world at large; Paris, reaffirming her historical powers of initiative by pointing out to all enslaved peoples (and which popular masses are not slaves?) the only path to emancipation and salvation; Paris, dealing a death blow to the political traditions of bourgeois radical­ ism and affording revolutionary socialism a substantial basis; Paris, earning once again the curses of every reactionary in France and in Europe; 202 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Paris , burying herself in her ruins in order to signif y a solemn repudiation of the triumphant reaction; redeeming, through her own misf ortu ne, the honor and prospects of France; and proving to a comf orted humani ty that, while life, intelligence and moral firmness may have deserted the upper classes, they thrive in the fullness of their powers in the proletariat; Paris, ushering in the new age, the age of defini tive and com prehensi ve liberation of the masses of the people and their solidar ity which hencef orth will be quite substantial, criss- crossing and over -riding the borders of States; Paris, doing patriotism to death and fo unding the religion of humanity upon her ruins; Paris , proclaiming herself humanitarian and atheist, and substituting the great realities of social life and fa ith in science fo r fictitious gods: the principles of liber ty, justice, equality and fratern ity, those timeless foundations of all human moral ity, fo r religi ous, political and juridical mor als; Paris, heroic, rational and fa ithful, confirming her vigorous belief in the destinies of human ity, through her glorious demise and death, bequeathing it much more vigorous and lively to succeeding genera tions; Paris, drowned in the blood of her most selfless children, is mankind cruci­ fied by the concerted international reaction in Europe, under the aegis of all the Christian churches and of the high priest of iniquity, the Pope: but the coming international, solidarity revol ution of peoples will be Paris's resurrecti on. Such is the true meaning, and such the beneficent, incalcu lable im­ plications of the Paris Comm une's two month life span and its never- to­ be-f or g otten collapse. The Paris Commune was too short-liv ed, and in its inner developme nt, it was unduly hobbled by the deadly battle which it as obliged to wage agJ.inst the VersJ.illes reaction, fo r it to be able to-I will not say apply, but elaborate in theo ry- its socialist program. Also, and this has to be recog nized, most of the mem bers of the Commune were not, stric tly, socialists and if they showed themse lves to be such, this was because they were hopeles sly carried away by the irresis tible fo rce of circumstan ces, by the nature of their environ ment, by the demands of their position, rather than by heartf elt convic tion. In the Comm une, the socialists, at the head of whom stood, of course, our fr iend Varlin, were but a very tiny min ority; at most they numbered 14 or 15 mem­ bers. Jacobins accounted fo r the remainder. But, let us be clear about this, there are Jacob ins and Jacob ins. There are Jacobin lawyers and doctrinar ians, like Mr. Gambetta, whose positivist, MIKHAIL BAK UNIN 203"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"pom pous, despotic and fo rmalistic republ icanism, having abjured the old revo lutionary fa ith and retained nothing of Jacobinism save the cult of unity and authority , has delivered the people's France to the Prussians, and later to the home- grown reaction : and there are staunchl y revol utionary Jacobi ns, heroes, the last honest representatives of the democr atic fa ith of 1793, capable of sacrif icing both their beloved unity and their cherished authority to the requi rements of the Revolu tion , rather than accommodate their consciences to the insolence of the reaction . These magnanim ous Jacob ins, at whose head stands Delescluze of course, a great soul and a great charac ter, seek the success of the Revolution above all else: and as there is no revolu tion without the masses of the people, and since those masses toda y are eminentl y endowed with the socialist instinct and can­ not mount any revolution other than an ec onomic and social revol ution, the authentic Jaco bins, surrendering ever more to the logic of the revol utionary mov emen t, must finish up becoming reluctant socialists . Such indeed was the situation of those Jacobins who belonged to the Paris Commune. Delescluze and man y another with him put their signatures to programs and proclamation s, the general tenor and promises of which were positi vely socialistic . But since, fo r all their bona fides and good intentions, they were only socialists a lot more superfi ciall y enthused than converted in their heart of hearts, and as they had not had the time nor the ability indeed to overcome and banish from their minds a host of bourgeois prejudices which were at odds with their new-f ound socialism, it is understan dable that, stymied by that inner turmoil, they were never able to move beyond generalizations nor take one of those decisi ve steps that might fo rever have severed their fe l­ lowship and all their connect ions with the bour geois world. This was a great misfortune fo r the Commune and fo r themse lves: they were paral yzed by it and they paralyzed the Com mune: but this cannot be counted against them as a fa ult.

Who will dare requir e more of them? The y are all the more deserving of fo rgive ness in that the people of Paris itself , under whose influence they thought and acted, were a lot more instinc­ tively socialist than socialists by belief or through considered reflection. Their every aspiration is comprehen sively and exclu sively socialist: but their idea s, or rather, the traditional expre ssions thereof cannot pretend to such loftiness. 204 MIKHAIL BAKUN IN"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"In the proletariat of France's larger towns and even in that of Paris, a lot of Jacobin prejudices, a lot of dictatorial and governmental idioms survive. The cult of authority, the necessary outcome of religious education, that historical source of all of the people's misfortunes, depravities and slavishness, has yet to be banished utterly from its heart. This is so true that even the people's most intelligent sons, the sincerest socialists, have yet to be delivered entirely from it. Root around in their consciences and you will find the Jacobin, and governmentalism, lurking in some dark recess, much shrunken, it is true, but not quite dead. Also, the circumstances of the tiny number of convinced socialists who were part of the Commune were exceedingly difficult. Not feeling that they had sufficient support from the great bulk of the Parisian populace , for the International Association's organization, which was in any case very flawed, numbered only a few thousand individuals, they had to wage a daily bat­ tle against the Jacobin majority. And in what a setting at that! They had to find work and bread for some hundreds of thousands of workers, they had to organize and arm them and they had to monitor reactionary activity in a sprawling city like Paris, which was under siege, famished and prey to every filthy trick by the reactionaries who had successfull y ensconced themselves in Versailles, with the permission and under the aegis of the Prussians . They had to counter with a revolutionary government and fight the government and army of Versailles, that is to say, in order to combat the monarchist and clerical backlash, they were obliged to set aside and sacrifice the basic premises of revol utionary socialism and organ ize thems elves into a Jacobin coun ter. Was it not onl y to be expected that, in such circumstanc es, the Jacobins, who were the stronger, in that they represented the majority of the Commune and who also possessed to an infinitely greater extent the political instinct, tradition and practice of governmental organization, should have enjoyed immeasu rable advantages over the socialists? The astonishing thing is that they did not make a lot more capital out of it than they did, that they failed to invest the Paris uprising with an exclusively Jacobin character, and that they allowed themselves, instead, to be swept into a social revolution. I know that many socialists, very conscientious about their theory, take our Paris friends to task for not having been socialist enough in their revolution­ ary practice, while all of the yaps of the bourgeois press, on the other hand, charge them with having abided only too faithfully by socialism's program.

Anyone who had the good fo rtune to be acquainted with Varl in, say, to name only the one of whose death we can be sure, knows how impassioned, thought through and deep-s eated were his and his friends' socialist convicti ons. These were men whose burning zeal, commi tmen t and bona fides could never have been called into question by anyone who had dealings with them. But precise ly because they \\vere men of good fa ith, they were fu ll of self .. doubt in the fa ce of the immense undertaking to which they had devoted their thoughts and their lives: they were so disparaging of themse lves! Also it was their conviction that in the social Revolu tion , which on this score as on every other is the diametrical opposite of political Revolu tion, the actions of individuals counted fo r virtuall y nothing and that the spontaneous action of the masses had to be everything. All that individuals could do was artic ulate, clarif y and dissemi nate ideas mirroring the people's instinct, and, in addi­ tion, contr ibute through their unceasing efforts to revolu tionary organiza tion of the natural might of the mass es, but no more than that: every thing else ought to and can only be achi eved by the people itself. Otherwise the upshot would be political dictdtorship, that is, reconstitution of the State, privilege , inequal ity, all of the State' s oppr essions, and, by a roundabout but logical route , restoration of the political, social and economic ensla vement of the masses of the people . Varl in and all his fr iends, like all honest socialists, and, broadl y speaking, like all toilers born and raised among the people, were very much subscribers to this perfectly legitimate prejudice against initi ative continuall y emanating fr om the same individ uals, against rule exerc ised by higher-up s, and, being above all else fa ir-minded, they trained this suspicion as much upon them­ selves as everyone else. Contrary to the authoritarian comm unists' notion -a quite wrong-headed notion as I see it-t hat a social Revolution can be ordained and organized either by a dictatorship or by a constituent assembly issuing from a political revol ution, our fr iends, the socialis ts of Paris , reckoned that only through ongoing spontaneous action of the mass es, groups and associations of the people could it be mounted and prosecuted to its fu llest extent .

That origination will never be anything other than a Procrustean bed upon which the more or less pronounced violence of the State will compel society to stretch out. Which is what has always happened hitherto, and it is precisely this ancient system of organization through force to which the social Revolution must put paid by restoring their full liberty to the masses, groups, communes, associa­ tions and indeed individuals, by destroying, for once and for all, the historic cause of all violence, the might and very existence of the State which, when its downf all comes, must necessar ily bring down with it all of the iniquities of juridical law along with all the lies of several cults, such law and such cults never having been anything other than the necessar y consequence, in ideas as well as in substance, of all of the violence represented, guaranteed and fostered by the State . It is self-evident that liberty is not about to be restored to humanity, and that the substantial interests of society, of the groups and of all the local organiza­ tions as well as all of the individuals who make up society, will not really be gratified until States are no more. Obviou sly, all the so-called general interests of society which the State is supp osed to repre sent, and which in point of fact are nothing but the general and standing negation of the positive interests of the regions, communes, associations and the greater number of individuals subjected to the State, add up to an abstraction, a figment, a falsehood, and the State is like one huge butchery and like a vast cemetery where, in the shade and under the pretext of that abstraction, all of the real interests, all of the vital forces of the land come along generou sly and blithely to let themselves be hacked up and buried: and since no abstraction ever exists of itself or for itself, as it has neither legs to walk on, nor arms to create, nor stomach to digest the stream of victims fed to it, then plainly, just as the religious or celestial abstraction, God, ill reality stands for the very positive, very substantial inter­ ests of a privileged caste, the clergy, its earthly counterpart, so that political abstraction, the State, stands for the no less positi ve and substantial interests of the class which is today the main, if not exclusive, exploiter class, and which, MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 207"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"moreover, tends to assimilate all others-the bourgeoisie. And just as the clergy is always divided and is today inclined to split even further into a very powerful, very wealthy minority and a very subordinate, passably impoverished majority, so the bourgeoisie and its several social and political organizations in industry, agriculture, banking and commer ce, as well as in every administr ative function of the State, financiaL legal, academic, police and military, tends to divide further with every passing day into a truly dominant oligarchy and a countless mass of more or less vain and demeaned creatures, their lives a perpetual illusion, inevitably and increasing ly driven down into the proletariat by an invisible force, the force of the current eco­ nomic development, and red uced to serving as the blind instruments of that omnipotent oligarch y. Abolition of Church and State must be the essential precondition for the real liberation of society: only after that can it and should it be organized dif­ ferently, though not from the top down and in accordance with some ideal scheme devised by a few sages or savants, or indeed by means of decrees issuing from some dictatorial force or even national assembly elected by universal suffrage. Such an arrangement, as I have said before. would inevitably lead to creation of a new State, and, consequ ently, to formation of a governmental aristocracy, which is to say, a whole class of people having nothing in common with the mass of the peo ple and, assur edly, that class would embar k again upon the exploitation and subjection of it, on the pretext of the common good or in order to sa ve the State . The future organization of society must proceed from the bottom up only, through free association or federation of the workers, into their associations to begin with, then into communes, regions, nations and, finally, into a great international and universal federation. Only then will the true and enliven­ ing order of freedom and general happiness come about-that order which, far from denying it, instead affirms and reconciles the interests of individuals and those of society. KARL MARX: THE PARIS COM MUNE' The cry of \"Social Republic!\" to which the Parisian proletariat had launched the February revolution represented little more than a vague longing for a Republic that would not just abolish the monarchist form of class rule, but class rule per se. The Commune was the positive embodiment of that Republic. Paris, the central seat of the former government power, and at the same 208 MIKHAI L BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"time, the French working class's social stronghold, had taken up arms against the attempt by Thiers and his Rurals to restore and perpetuate the former governmental power bequeathed them by the Empire. Paris was able to resist because, on account of the siege, it had got rid of the army and replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which was made up of workers. It was now a matter of turning this de Ja cto state into a durable institution . The Commune's first decree, therefore, abolished the standing army and rep laced it with a people in arms. The Commune was made up of municipal councilors, elected by universal suffrage in the various arrondissements of the city. These were at all times answerable and subject to recal1.2 Most of its members were, naturally, workers or acknowledged representati ves of the working class. The Commune was not to be a parliamentary body, but an active body, executive and legislature in one. Instead of carrying on as the instrument of the central government, the police were immedi ately stripped of their political powers and turned into an instrument of the Commune, accountable and revocable at any moment. The same was true of officials from all other branches of the administr ation. From Commune members down to the bottom of the scale, public service had to be repaid with a workman's wage . The traditional back-handers and commissions of high State dignitaries vanished along with those dignitar­ ies themselves. The public services ceased to be the private preserves of the central government's henchmen. Not merely the city administration, but the whole of the initiative hitherto exercised by the State was transferred back into Commune hands. With the standing army and the police, those material instrum ents of central government power, done away with, the Commune turned to the task of smashing the spiritual instrument of oppression, the priestly power: it decreed Church and State separated and all churches expropriated insofar as they constituted proprietorial bodies. Priests were despatched to the peace­ ful retreat of private life, there to live upon alms from the faithful, like their predecessors, the apostles. Every single educational establishment was thrown open to the people free of charge and simultaneou sly released from all Church or State interference. Thus, not only was education made accessible to all, but science itself was freed from shackles which class prejudices and governmental power had placed on it. Court officials were stripped of that sham independence which had served only to disguise their squalid submission to every succeeding government, to MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 209"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"which, one by one, they had pledged their loyalty, only to break it thereafter. Like every other public official, magistrates and judges were to be electable, accountable and revocable. The Paris Commune of course was to have set the pattern for every great industrial center in France. Once Commune rule had been established in Paris and other secondary sites, the former central government would have had to yield in the provinces also to the self-government of the producers. In a short outline of national organization which the Commune was denied the time to develop, it is explicitly stated that the Commune was to be the political model even for the tiniest rural hamlet, and that in cou ntry areas the standing army was to be replaced by a people's militia with an extremel y brief term of service. The rural communes in each department were to administer their shared affairs through a delegates' assembly in the departmental capital, and these departmental assemblies would in turn send deputies to the national delegation in Paris: delegates would be subject to recall at any moment and bound by the imperative mandate issued by their electors. Those few but significant duties retained by the central government would not be abolished, as has falsely and deliberately been claimed, but would be performed by com­ munal officials, which is to say by officials strictly accountable. There was to be no injury done the unity of the nation: instead it would be orchest rated hy means of the communal Constitution ; it would be made a reality through destruction of the State power which purported to be the embodim ent of that nationhood, but which sought to remain independent of the nation itself, and superior to it, when it was really only a parasitical excrescence. While it was important that the purely repressive organs of the former governmental authority be lopped off, its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority that claimed a pre-eminence over society itself and awarded to accountable servants of society. Instead of deciding once every three or six years which member of the ruling class was to \"represent\" and trample the people underfoot inside Parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the people, organized into communes, the way individual suffrage serves any other employer on the look-out for workers and staff to run his business. And it is a commonplace that societies, like individuals, when it comes to genuine matters, generally manage to place everyone properly and, in the event of a mistake's being made, manage to make prompt amends. Then again, nothing could have been more alien to the spirit of the Commune than the replacement of universal suffrage by some hierarchical 210 MIKHAIL BAKUNIN"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"investiture. Broadly speaking, it is the fate of entirely novel historical forma­ tions to be mistaken for the counter to older, even extinct forms, of social life, to which they may bear a certain resemblance. Thus, in this new Com­ mune which shattered the power of the modern State, some have been intent upon seeing an evocation of the medieval commu nes, which to begin with, prefigured that State power and then became its foundation. 1 The communal Constitution has mistakenly been interpreted as an at­ tempt to break down into a federation of small States, (as Montesquieu and the Girondins dreamed about), that unity of great nations which, although originall y engendered by violence, has now grown into a potent factor in social production. The antagonism between the Co mmune and State power has wrongly been seen as an overblown form of the age-old struggle against over-centralization. Particular historical circumstances may, in other countries, have thwarted the classical development of the bourgeois form of governm ent, as has happened in France, and, as in England, may have allowed the huge central organs of the State to ramit), through corrupt vestries, 4 jobbing municipal councilors and ferocious welfare board administr ators in the towns, and, in the counties, effectively hereditary justices of the peace. The communal Constitution would have restored to the body of society all of the resources hitherto gobbled up by the parasitical State which feeds upon society and hobbles its freedom of movement. By virtue of that fact alone, it would have been the launching pad for France's regenerat ion. ( ... ) Implicit as a self-evident fa ct in the very existence of t he Commune was municipal freedom: but henceforth it was no impediment to State power, which had been done away with. Only the mind of a Bismarck ( ... ) could have come up with the idea of ascribing to the Paris Commune aspirations to that lampooll of the old French municipal organization from 1791 represented by Prussian llmnicipal government, which degrades administration in the towns until these arc Illere secondary cogs in the Prussian State's police apparatus. The Commune made a reality of that watchword of all bourgeois revo ­ lutions, cheap government, by abolishing these two great drains upon ex­ penditure: the standing army and State officials. Its very existence supposed non-existence of the monarchy which, in Europe at any rate, is the usual burden and indispensa ble mask of class rule. It supplied the Republic with the basis of genuinely democratic institutions. But its ultimate objective was neither \"cheap government\" nor the \"real Republic\": these were merely its MIKHAIL BAKUNIN 211"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"corollaries. The multiplicity of constructions placed upon the Commune, and the multiplicity of interests making claims upon it demonstrate that it was a political form with every potential for expansion , whereas every form of government up to then had placed the emphasis on repression.

Not knowing, not having ever seen or imagined any practice other than bourgeois practice, lots of them reckon that it would be legitimate warf are to resort t o that same practice in order to combat the bour geoisie. They are naive enough to believ e that what murders labor may emancipate it, and that they, as well as the bour geoisie itself , might deploy against the latter, the weapon by means of which the bour geoisie grinds them down. This is a great mistake.

( ... ) We too seek cooperation: we are even convinced that cooperation in every branch of labor and science is going to be the prevailing form of social organization in the future. But at the same time, we know that it cannot prosper, develop fully and freely and encompass the whole of human industry, unless its foundation is equality, when all capital, all the instruments oflabor, including the land, will have been handed back to labor as collective property. So we look upon that requirement above all, and organization of the interna­ tional power of the workers of every land as the main goal of our great associa­ tion. That accepted, far from being adversaries of cooperative undertaking s at present, we regar d them as in many respects necessiti es. At first, and this in our view for the moment is their chief advantage, they accustom the workers to organizing, conducting and running their af fairs for themselves, without in­ terference, whether from bourgeois capital or from bourgeois management. It is to be wished that, when the time for social liquidation comes, every country and every locality should boast lots of cooperative associations which, if they are well-orga nized, and above all rooted in the principles of solidarity and collectivity and not in bourgeois exclusivi sm, will carry society from its current state through to a state of equality and justice '.vithout undul y great traumas. But if they are to be able to perform that task, the International Association must stand over only those cooperative associations built upon its principles. II.

Implicit in this state of affairs, where mutual societies are concerned, is federation of the local societies, helping one another out by means of money loans, organizing meetings to discuss social issues and, in concert, taking steps of mutual interest.

Born in 1842 and dying in 1890, de Paepe was a witness to the grandeur and decline and then the resurgence of the Belgian labor movement. Son of a Belgian State official, de Paepe trained for a career in the law, but his father's sudden death compelled him to abandon his studies. He became a typographer under Desire Brismee and promptly the latter's colleague in the free thought movement. He joined the Societe des Solidaires (Fellowship Society) before joining with some new friends who included Voglet and Steens to launch the Le Peuple (People) society in 1861: this was a militant democratic association from which the Belgian section of the International Working Men's Association was to emerge four years later. From then on, up until his death, de Paepe, who had in the interim resumed his studies and qualified as a doctor, was in the forefront of the Belgian labor moveme nt. We cannot rehearse everyone of the phases of his busy life. 2 Let us note only that he was delegated to virtu ally every congress of the International where his addresses and speeches were among the most noteworth y. Categorizing his ideology and political stance would be an even more daunting task than describing his life. Free-thi nker, federalist, Proudhonist, collectivist, commu nist, anarchist, social democrat? What in fact was he? But what was the Belgian labor movement of his day, this \"motley socialism, both mutualist and marxist, that goes under the name of collectivi sm\"-to borrow Elie Halevy's felicitous but necessaril y incomplete phrase?3 It strikes us that the two questions are really the same and that they cannot be answered on the sole basis of the classifications of \"marxism,\" Proudhonist mutualism or anarchism in the Bakuninist sense. For de Paepe's thinking and that of his colleagues was, as well as being influenced by the great schools of thought emanating from Germany and France, tainted with the theories of Belgian thinkers like Potter and Colins,4 and by workers' traditions going back DIRECT ACTION AND liBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTI ON FORESHADOWED 219"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"to the days of the guilds. To be sure, de Paepe had periods when he was more or less Proudhonist and anarchist, but he also came under the sway of Marx's thought. But, reading his writings and speeches, we get the impression that, while inclining sometimes towards the one and sometimes towards the other tendency within the internationalist movement, de Paepe never wandered far from that Belgian collectivism which sought to reconcile the idea of col­ lective ownership and the idea of freedom of the individual. In his questing after a system founded upon social justice and political liberty, de Paepe-or so we believe, at least-never made a definitive choice with regard to the proper means of bringing about this goal. The advocates of centralization often criticized his federalism, while anarchists took him to task for certain \"statist\" features of his system. Likewise, de Paepe's attitude with regard to the choice between absten­ tion or political activity was never categorical. Undecided at the time of the London Conference (September 1871), he turned \"abstentionist\" for a few years only to end up joining the Belgian socialist 'Youth' who prefaced the creation of the Belgian Workers' Party (POB) of 1885. Let us note further that de Paepe's extremely conciliatory nature afforded him great suppleness when it came to taking a stand. A tolerant free spirit, he sought to pursue discussions through to a philosophical level which might facilitate an understanding which was not fe asible in a climate of cont roversy. 220 DIRECT ACTI ON AND LIBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTION FORESHADOWED"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"CESAR DE PAEPE ON THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FUTU RE' Let us take as our starting point the present state of affairs, the public services as they currently are: then, let us strike from those services whichever of them a new social organization appears to make redundant; let us look at which public services the new requirements will necessitate, and those which, starting right now, are a palpably felt necessity: then let us ask to whom the performance of these various public services naturally and rationally falls. At which point, we are impelled to cast a glance over the overall economic trend, and ask ourselves if the thoroughgoing changes which that trend imposes or is going to impose upon certain industries, turn or are about to turn those industries into veritable public services: finally, we end by looking into how and in what manner public services in general ought to be performed in the future. MANAG EMENT BY WORKER S' COMP ANIES? By whom ought the various public services to be organized and performed? Here we find two great currents of thought, two downright antagonistic schools. As a general rule, one of these schools tends to abandon public services to the private enterprise of individuals or spontaneou sly formed companies, and thereby divests them, in a way, of their character as public services in order to turn them into private undertakings: so much for the laissez-faire school. The other, as a general rule, tends to place the public services under the direction of the State, the province (department or canton), or commune: this is the inter­ ventionist school. True, to begin with at any rate, the concessio n of the railways, mines, etc., to workers' companies would not display the same characteristic of runaway exploitation which has come to typify the financial concerns which presently hold the concession on these great public services. But let us not forget that the modern capitalist aristocracy too emerged from the third estate: let us not forget that, before they became what they are today, the great financial barons (or if not them, at least their fathers or grandfathers) were workers, but workers placed in a situation of privilege.

Dou btless we will be told that concessions are granted only upon certain stipulations, and that the workers' com panies, in accepting the concession , would be bound by contrac t. But the capitalists' companies to which the State has conceded collieri es, railroad lines, etc., are bound by contract too: is that any impedim ent to their handing out fat dividends to their share-holders or plundering public assets as brazenly as you like? From the moment that the companies to which you grant any monop oly become owners of their work plant, where is the contract that is going to prevent them from improvi ng that plant, reducing over heads, not replacing staff who die, and finall y amassing capital -in short, from becoming a new privileged class? At best we should, in those circumstan ces, have the grim pleasure of substituting a worker aristoc­ racy fo r a bour geois aristocr acy, even as our fo rebears substituted a bour geois aristocr acy fo r the old high-born aristocr acy. We will be told that the plant need not neces sarily be the propert y of the company; that it can be supplied to the compan y by the greater social collec tive, and remain the inalienable property of the latter; whereupon the improve ments resulting fr om the progress of civiliz ation would bring benefit to the society as a whole : we grant that, but then these companies wou ld no longer really be concessionary com panies, but \\vould be associate entrepre­ neurs simply bound to pert(JTm certain public services on behalf of society, as represented by the commune, province, canton or State, etc. STATE MANAG EMEN T?

( .. . ) Starting from the notion of the State as communicated to us by the history of every country, which is to say, from the despotic State, from the State which has everywhere to date been nothing more than the organized domination of a single family, huge caste or class over the multitude which is reduced to a state oflegal and economic slavery, a great number of socialists have cried out: War on the State! They do not want to hear talk about the State in any form, no matter how interprete d. They declare very plainly that they seek the absolute destruction of the State, of all States: and the more logical among them, perceiving rightly that the commune is, in the final an alysis, merely a mini-State, a State with a tinier territory, whose functions are performed on a smaller scale than ordinary States, declare that they want no more to do with the commune State than with the State proper. Upon their standard they have daubed the device: An-archy! Not \"anarchy\" in the sense of disorder, since, on the contrary, they believe in the possibility of arriving at true order through spontaneous organization of economic forces, but An-arch y, in the sense in which Proudhon intended it, that is, absence of power, absence of authority, and in their minds, in the sense of abolition of the State, the terms authority and power being in their view absolute synonyms for the word State. But alongside this traditional historical notion of the State, which, in fact, ha s thus fa r never been anythin g other than autho rity, power, and, fu rther, despotism, (and the worst of despotisms at that, since it has always been ex­ ercised by an idle minority over the toiling majority), these socialists have taken account of a true fact and one that will become increasing ly true, a fact that is one of the greatest economic phenomena of modern times: they have seen, in the chief branches of modern production , large industry increasingly replacing small-scale industry, centralization of capital, more and more massive application of collective effc)ft and division oflabor, the incessant introduction of mighty steam-driven machinery powering a host of tools and machine s, tools hitherto isolated, now requiring that huge masses of workers be gathered into enormous factories, and that all of this cannot but add day by day to the domain of big industry. They have seen that in this great modern production, the isolated worker or artisan gives way to collective labor force, to workers' collectives; they have seen that these workers' collectives, faced with the al- DIRECT ACTI ON AND LIBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTI ON FORESHADOWED 223"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"lied capitalists whose interests arc diametric ally and openly opposed to their own, had of necessity to form themselves into resistance groups, into trades unions, and indeed implicate the workers of small industries in this moveme nt: that association by trades mmt spread, and their conclusion is that such spon­ taneous organization of the working class had to furnish the basis for a new social grouping not unlike the spontaneous banding together into bourgeois communes in the Middle Ages: community of interests inevita bly impelling trades bodies to spread in order to support one another, out of this grows a whole range of federations -at first local, then regional, then international . What is more, not content with these theoretical observations, they have embarked upon practice: like the English workers, they have founded trade unions, they have federated with one another, and they have, quite rightly, sought to found the International Association upon this federative economic basis. Thus they have embraced this grouping of workers' bodies which is rooted in the depths of modern economic life as a counter to the more or less artificial and obsolete grouping into purely political Communes and States, and predicted the imminent demise of these latter. So far so good. But we wonder whether the workers' bodies, the associated trades bodies of the same locality, whether this Commune of proletarians, in short, on the day that it replaces today's official Commune or bourgeois Com­ mune, will not act just like the latter vis-a-vis certain public services whose survival is essential to the life of society? We \\vonder whether, in the new Commune, there will be no need for security, a civil state, maintenance of roads and public squares, street lighting, drinking water in the houses, se\\ver maintenance, and a whole host of public services that we listed at the start of this work? Would there not be a need for workers' groups, the Commune's trades bodies, to select from among their number delegates to each of the public services, delegates charged with operating these various services, unless these groups prefer instead to act as a bloc in appointing a delegation to share manage­ ment of these various services? In either instance , does that not saddle us with a local public service administration, a communal administration' But all public services cannot be handled by a purely local administr ation, since many of them, and the most important of them at that, are by their very natures fated to operate over a territory larger than that of the Commune: is one Commune about to run the railways, maintain the high\\vays, dam the rivers, channel the streams, see to delivery of mail and the despatch ing of telegrams to other localities, etc.? Obviou sly not! So Communes have to come 224 DIRECT ACTI ON AND LIBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTI ON FORESHADOWED"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"to some arrangement, organize themselves into a Federation of Communes and choose a delegation to look after public services. Whether that delegation be appointed with a general remit to run all great regional public services, or with a special remit applicable to a particular service, matters not: in any event these delegates have to be in direct and ongoing contact with one another, so they still represent a regional or national public administ ration, the name having no bearing upon the thing. To start with, is it not more than likely that, for want of bases other than traditions and language, these regions or nations would broadly correspond to the present nationalitie s, or, at least, to the chief great divisions of those nationalitie s, say, in the case of Great Britain, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland? or, in the case of Switzerland, germanophone Switzerland and francophone Switzerland? or, in the Belgian case, Wallonie and Flanders (unless the latter, on account of especial affinities, linguistic, let us say, should rejoin Holland)? And what is that regional or national Federation of communes going to be, in essence, other than a State? Yes, a State, for we should call things by their name. Except that this will be a federative State, a State formed from the bot­ tom up. A State having at bottom, at its origins, an economic association, the grouping of trades bodies making up the Commune, and, in addition, having, no doubt, alongside its great public services adminis tration directly emanating from the federated Communes, a Labor Chamber emanating direc tly from the general unions (in England they call them amalgamated unions) made up oflocal unions from the same trade federated at regional level. \"AN AN-AR CHIC STATE\" The State is a machine; it is the instrum ent of the great public services. Like any other machine, this one too is essential for large-scale modern production and for substantial traffic in the products resulting from the same: like any other machine, the latter too has been murderous for the workers and has thus far always worked for the exclusive benefit of privileged classes. If there is to be an end of that, the workers must take over that machine. But in taking it over, let us check whether the State machine does not stand in need of important modifica­ tions so that it cannot injure anyone: let us check whether certain gears which bourgeois exploitation had overloaded do not need removing and others, which bourgeois carelessness had neglected, added: let us see indeed ifit does not need to be established upon wholly new foundations. With those reservations , we can say: workers , the machine belongs to us, the State belongs to us.

On the contrary, the horror which an-archy strikes into the bourgeois class (a horror which seems to us to be a lot more in vogue among them than felt by the workers ) means that it brings a smile to our lips and that we should be very sorry to drop the word. With the permission of our anarchist friends, therefore, we \\vill not exac tly reject the word, although strictly speaking, it ma y not mean the same thing to us as it does to them. After all, the State, as we think of it and as we wish it to be, is not exactly an authorit y, a governmental system, something imposed upon the people by force or by guile, in short, an \"archy,\" to use the Greek term. Is there anything very authorit arian about expressions like State postal service, State railway, State-sponso red clearance of scrubland, etc.? We have no difficulty conceiving of a non-author itarian State (we were going to say an an-archie State, but we desisted, because many of our readers would have regarded juxtaposition of those two terms as some sort of swearword). In fact, real authority certainly does not consist of the act of carrying out decisions taken, or implementing laws passed, or running public services in accordance with the law, but rather of the act oflaying down and imposing law. Now, legislation may very well not be the handiwork of the State and may lie out­ side of its remit, either because laws are passed directly in the Communes or at some other level, or, because of the rounded education given to all and the single-mindedness resulting from that, society's laws one day become so self-evident to the spirit that they are no more in need of being passed than are the laws of astronom y, physics or chemistry. And so, to the Commune fall the merely local and communal public ser­ vices under the purview of the local administration appointed by the trades bodies of the area and operating under the supervision of all local inhabitants . To the State fall the more widespread regional or national public services, under the management of a regional administration appointed by the Federation of Communes and operating under the gaze of the regional Chamber of Labor. Is that alP No; there are and increasingly there will be public services which, by their very nature, are international or inter-regional (the actual names mat­ ter very little here). To cater for these there will have to be an internatio nal, and, we should say, voluntary federation that is universaL humanitarian or planetar y, while conceding that, given the backwardness of the State among certain peo ples, it will take quite some time before the reality can live up to these epithets.

COM MUNI SM AND \"ANARCHY\" But, we will, perhaps, be told ( . . . ) shouldn't ( .. . ) all branches of production be regarded as destined to be organized as public services? Can you not see that that would mean a descent into the most frightful communis m!? It is an astonishing thing, the power to frighten which lurks in certain words, when the idea which they articulate roams far and wide and is perfectly acceptable as long it is dressed up under some other name. This is the case with the word an-ar chy, which raises the hackles of our bourgeois, whereas the idea of indefinite whittling away of governmental functions and ulti­ mately the abolition of government is the last word among the laissez-faire economists favored by these brave bourgeois! And it is the case with the idea of the State and State intervention in industrial affairs, where another type of person is concerned, who lumps together the official economists and the anti-State socialists, along with a central administr ation: the State, in short, is something which could very well have been managed without until the recent advent oflarge-scale modern production, but which has become and is increasingly becoming a social necessity in the face oflarge-scale output and large -scale traffic, as the usual organ of economic centralizatio n, the usual manager oflarge industries which supply the raw materials for production and the great transport fleets to carry products to the consum er. So necessary is it that, without such economic centralization in the State's hands, economic forces would centralize anyhow in the hands of mighty companies which are out and out oligarchical States. The term communism has had the singular distinction of ha ving been repudiated by socialists as a calumny, having been envisaged by economists as the last word in utopias, and in the bourgeoisie's eyes, it appears as a theory consecrating ongoing theft and promiscu ity, in short, the worst of blights. As for ourselves, who are not frightened by the word \"State,\" which some find so scary, any more than we are frightened by the word \"an-archy\" which others find so horrifying, why should we take fright at the word \"commu­ nism\"?

But the word communism also has a more precise meaning, in that it represents a genuinely scientific id ea. Communism means common ownership, public ownership, social ownership. BOUR GEOIS STATE AND WORKER STATE ( . . . ) We have seen that the State shoots us down, passes sentence upon us, im­ prisons us and shoots us once again, and we wish to divest the State of its judges, its jailers and its fusiliers. With our very own eyes we have seen that the Sta te, even the present, bourgeois State, whenever it sought to produce on its own account instead ofleaving production to companies of capitalists who have no aim other than to enrich thems elves, produced a higher quality of product at cheaper cost than those companies: the State railways in Belgium and the postal service and the constructi on of seaports are all testimony to that.

THE \"WORKER S' STATE\" RESEMBL ES THE PRESENT STATE What is the idea underpi nning modern States and by invoking which needs do supporters of the State justify its existence? The fact is that in all dealings between people, there are purely private dealings, but there are also esse ntial relations of concern to one and all: hence the necessity for a public order, by means of which normal pursuit of public and general dealings between men can be guarante ed. Ponder well the Brussels memorand um, and you will find that the notion of the workers' State, by which it is inf ormed, is, fundamen­ tally, absolutely analogous with that of the current State. Here come the objections: reorganized, directed and adminis tered by the working classes, the State will have lost the oppressi ve, exploitative nature which it currently displays in the bourgeoisie's hands: instead of the political, judicial, police and military organization which it is at present, it is to be an economic agency, regulator of public services organized in accordance with social needs and the appliance of the sciences. But let us take stock of the functioning of such a State. Lawful political action or the social Revolution have placed the running of the Commune and State in working class hands. What the laboring classes seek-emancipation of labor from all rule and all exploitation by capital-they can effect. The instru­ ment oflabor must become collective property, production must be organized, intercourse proceed, trade assist intercourse, and the present ignorance must be replaced by scientific and humane science and education: the existence of individuals and of society must be assured by hygienic conditions; public security must take the place of the current antagonism, the criminal interplay of hateful passions and brutal rivalries. The proletariat, having become dicta­ tor through the State, ordains collective ownership and organizes this for the benefit either of the Commune or of the State; it lays down the conditions upon use of the instrum ents of labor, in order to safeguard the interests of production, those of the producer groups, those of the Communes and of the State: then it prescribes the operation of exchange of produce, orchestrating and developing the means of intercourse: devises a program for training and education of the young, entrusting its impleme ntation either to the Com­ mune or to the State; it establishes a communal and general health service: DIRECT ACTI ON AND LIBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTI ON FORESHADOWED 231"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"and takes what ever steps may be necessary to guarantee public secur ity in the Comm unes and in the State.

Precise ly as is standar d practice toda y. This task of distinguishing and disentangling the private fr om the public, of orga nizing every thing public, ever ything fa lling under the remit of the Commune and the State, cannot be handled by the proletariat directl y as a body.

So there will still be a minority to whom the majority will lay down the law, or vice versa; fo r, given that the State is ackno wledged as a necessary safeguard fo r public interests, the State's law will be binding upon every one, and any who seek to evade it are to be treated as criminals.

That revo lutionary measure, practic ally superior to all decrees fr om dictatorial assemblies which might fe el themse lves qualit led to direct the Revol ution or the who lesale emanc ipation of the working classes: and spontaneous action of the masses of the populace, whence alone this may spring, is, right fr om the first acts of the Revol ution, the practical assertion of the princi ple of auton omy and fe deration which becomes the basis of all social combination . Along with the bour geoisie' s economic privileg es, all State institutions by means of which the bour geoisie sustains its privileges will have fo undered in that revol utionary storm. Now let us examine the implications of such a Revolution fo r the reor­ ganization of society. In any local ity, the various trades bodies are masters of the situation: in such and such an indust ry, the implements employed are of minimal value: in another, they are of consid erable value and a wider useful­ ness: if the group of producers employed in that industry are to be proprietors of the implements used, ownershi p of them may lead to a monopol y fo r one group of work ers, to the detri ment of other group s. The revo lutionar y neces­ sities which have driven laboring group s into concerted action also commend to them fe deration agreements by means of which they mutuall y guarantee the gains of the Revolut ion: of necess ity, these agreements will be comm u­ nal, region al and internat ional, and will enshrine sufficient assurances that no group may arrogate the benefits of the Revol ution to itself alone. Thus, it seems to us that collecti ve ownership ought to be at fi rst comm unal, then regional, even international, according to the more or less general deve lop­ ment and importance of such and such a branch of human activity, such and such a natural resour ce, such and such instrum ents of labor built up by preceding labor. As to the constitution of groups of prod ucers, the spontaneity of the revo ­ lutionary interests to which they owe their gestation is to be the starting point fo r their organization, and fo r the spread of their organization, with an eye to reor ganizing society. Banded together freely fo r revol utionary action , the workers will stick to such free associ ation when it comes to orga niza tion of produc tion, exchange, commer ce, training and educ ation, health, and security: and just as, in revol utionary strife, the hostile attitude of one individual within 234 DIRECT ACTION AND liBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTIO N FO RESH ADOWED"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"such and such a group, of one group within such and such a commune, one commune within a region. one region in an international context, has fa iled to stall the onward progress of Revol ution, so isolation, when it comes to expan­ sion of the gains of the Revol ution, will not be capable of halting the onward progress of the to iling masses operat ing without let or hindranc e. T HE S TATE REPL ACED BY THE FEDER ATION OF COMMUNE S Let caref ul note be taken of the essential difference between the workers' State and the Federation of Comm unes. The State determines what constitutes public service and how that public service is to be organized: there we have human activity regim ented. In the Federation of Commun es, toda y the shoe mender works at home, in one room: tomo rrow, thanks to the appl iance of some discovery, shoe production can be multipl ied a hundr ed-fold and sim­ plified at the same time: shoe-menders will theref ore band together, fe derate with one another and set up their worksho ps, their manuf actories and thereby involve thems elves in orchestrated activity. The same is true of every branch of human activity: that which is restricted organizes in a restricted way; that which is comprehen sive, organizes in a com preh ensive way, at the levels of group, commune and fe deration alike. This is experience, day-to- day prac tice placed in the service of human liberty and human activity . In the context of such organization, what becomes of the public services of the present State, its legislation, its jurisdiction, its police, its army, its official schooling and official Church? The free contract replaces law: if there are disputes, these are judged by arbitration panels within the group s where the disputes originate: and as far as repressi ve measures are concerned, these now have no reason to exist in a society fo unded upon free organizati on-such and such a group's organization and action being inca pable of harming me in any way, if there is parity of esteem for the orga nization and action of the group of which I am a member, in that such organiza tion and action is hard to disenta ngle from the interests of emancipated humanity, once the Social Revol ution has swept away all of the practical implications of bour geois ism. A secur ity service may well still have a temporary usefulness but it cann ot survive as an institution with the genera l, indispensa ble, irksome and oppre s­ sive remit which it en joys under the present arrangem ent.

Today only the ignorant and people of bad fa ith dare argue that solution of the social question can be sought by means other than Revol ution. We are pleased to recor d that our fr iends from German y, in spite of the lawf ul character of their current socialist agitation , are in agreement with us upon this point. But the Revol ution may come to pass in two ways: it may have as its immediate objective and also as the basis for its action, the working classes' conquest of political power within the State as it stands and conversion of that bour geois State into a workers' State: then agai n, it may have as its immediate objective and as the basis of its action, destruction of every State and spon taneous, fe derative combination of all of the proletariat's revolu tionary forces. While revol utionary action can vary fr om coun try to country, it is also liable to variation in the communes of the same coun try: here the Comm une retains an author itarian, gove rnmental character , an aspect even of bour geois- ism: elsewhere , there will be a clean sweep . If due account is taken of the current circumstances of the peoples of the different civilized States, and of the varying views still current on such matt ers, it will be understood that it is inevitable that the Revol ution will be subject to extreme variati on.

How could it be otherwise when toda y we see a great country like German y clinging to the notion of the workers' State, and others , like Italy and Spain, clinging to the notion of a Fede ration of Comm unes? This diversity of revo ­ lutionary tendencies has given the bour geoisie grounds fo r accusing socialism of impoten ce. With a modicum of fo resight, however, it is easy to appr eciate that, while there may be differences regar ding the terms of a new organiza­ tion of socie ty, the working classes are more and more united on working to bring dow n the bourgeois edifice. And such difference cannot be a source of impotence: rather, it is a sour ce of strength, in this sense-that workers' grou ps, implementing their own views and respecting the views of other grou ps, will, all of them, have all the more interest in the Revolution's succeeding. 236 DIRECT ACTION AND liBER TARIAN CONS TRUCTIO N FORESHADO WED"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"In what respect will it halt the proletariat's revolutionary march, if the Germans make a reality of the workers' State, while the Italians, Spaniards and French make a reality of the Federation of Communes?

We would even take this conviction so far as to declare that it is the Federation of Communes that will emerge from the Social Revolution with the greatest power. This Federation of Communes has been taken to task for being an obstacle to achievement of a broad agreement , a complete union of the workers, and for not offering the same potential for action as a State, when it comes to revolutionary action. But how are the workers' groups, freely federated within the International, to practice solidarity, accomm odate one another and reach agreement? The fact is that the economic situation itself compels them to practice solidari ty. What form will that take, once their action is no longer opposed by all of the hindrances the current order has to offer? How comes it that the International grows in potential for action as long as it is a Federation, while it comes apart as soon as its General Council seeks to turn it into a State?

His father, a Swiss from Neuchatel, was a natural ized Engl ishm an: his mother was French. His father's fa mily lived in Fleurier in the Val-dc- Travers. There, around 1�15, his grandf ather had fo unded a clock -making firm with a branch in Lond on. He was a republ ican and had had to flee to the canton ofVaud in the wake of the distur bances in 1831 . James Guill aume's fa ther arrived in Lon don at the age of twenty, a skilled clock-maker even by that date, to replace his uncle as branch man ager. He was not an ordi nary man and culture held rather more fascination for him than the watch business . Not content with mastering German and Spanish during his leisure hours, he also studied the natural sciences, in which he had an especial interest, as well as philos ophy. In 1843, he married a young and highl y cultivated woman who came from a fa mily of musi cians. In 1848, after a Republic was proclaimed in Neuchat el, James Guilla ume' s fa ther, himself an enthusiastic repub lican, retu rned to Switzer land. He was soon appointed ajudge, then prefect of the Val-de- Trave rs, and from then on concentrated exclu sively upon public life. Elected State Councilor in 1853, he returned again and again over a period of thirty-five years . James Guillaume was fo ur years old then when he arrived in Swit zerland. At the age of nine- and-a-half years , he entered grammar school, at the age of sixteen years , he matriculated into what is toda y called the academ y, and stayed there until 1862. A some what undisciplined student, he was often in hot water with the school authorities who were royalist and religious . But whereas during the year he had blotted his copy book with his willf ul atti­ tudes, he made up the lost ground in the examina tions , always coming first. The important thing about his school career is not what he did in class -he did not listen to his teachers , having no conf idence in them -but that he was determi ned to learn on his own and what was going on inside his head. He read every volume in his father's library, being enthused by the Anci ent world, the French Revolut ion, philosophy and especia lly Spinoza and poetry ranging from Homer and Shakespear e through to Goethe and Byron, and was stirred by Rabela is, Moliere and Volt aire.

In Neuchatel, the strife between repub lican and royalist was bitter. From that time on, Guillaume was fa scinated by the history of the Revol ution , and his heroes were drawn fr om among the Montagnar ds: Marat (himself a native ofNe uchatel), Robespierre and Saint -J ust. In September 1862, Guil laume traveled up to Zurich; he was to read phi­ losoph y, complete his education, and train as a teacher of Classi cs. He enrolled at the philological and peda gogical institute run by Kochl y. Kochl y and the aesthetician Vischer were the only teachers he ever had whom the young anti-authoritarian took seriousl y, and how! In Zurich, Guillaume fa miliarized himself with the German mind, its poets and philosophe rs. He also immersed himself in Greek literature. It was in Zurich that he began a translation of novelist Gottfried Keller's The Folk fr om Sedl u'yla. Though Swis s, Keller was a super b writer of German. Guill aume was the first person ever to render Keller into French and his book appeared in 1864. As yet, socialism was virtu ally non-exi stent as fa r as he was concerned . When a slightly younger colleague confided that he had an enthusiastic admir ation for Proudhon, Guill aume's reply was that Proudhon was a sophist. In the spring of 1864, Guil laume was obliged to return to Neuchatel. Much to his regret, he had to abandon his plans to make a study visit to Paris. As the year ended, he sat the examination fo r a teaching position in a trades school and was posted to the College de Lode.

He observed and his heart rebelled and his mind was incensed. He had a passion fo r truth, which ignited his passion fo r justice. He was struck by the fu tility of his classical education, and shrug ged his shoulders as his mind wandered to his old plans fo r the future. Though a poet, he abjured song, as he now gave car to the cries ofliving poetry. A historian , he wondered whether the Revolu­ tion was over, or indeed whether it had yet begun. To make his life worth the living, he meant to devote it to acces sible education fo r the populace: fo r a start, he laid on ev ening classes fo r appr entice s.

He was tortured by such questions fo r a long time: when, in the end, he bowed to negation of metaphys ical free will, it left him calm and with solid ground underf oot. His thinking lacked fo cus. howeve r; and the socialist had not yet taken shape in the heart of the teacher and meta physician. The French coop erative movement spilled over into Switzer land, and it was this that was to ignite the interest of the even ing classes. In 1865, a section of the International was set up in La Chaux -de-Fonds: a people which had begun to help itself deserved a helping hand. It onl y remained fo r him to disco ver its living embodiment, commi tment and patience, life and death sacrifice: such was the image which Guill aume admired and cherished in Co nstan t Mem on, veteran of the Neucha­ tel riots , a revolu tionary and repub lican who had never known anything other than revol ution and republ ic. From then on, Guillaume was mold ed; he was eager to act and knew why to act. As to the how, he still dithered a little. He thought of becoming a village schoolmast er so as to get closer to the people; then of becoming a compos itor, just as Constan t de Meuron had turned his hand to the guilloch e craft. He was talked out of both ideas after it was shown him that ifhe stepped down a class, he would lose virtu ally all of the useful influence he might wield. In the autumn of 1866, Constant de Meuron and James Guillaume fo unded the Le Locle section of the International and Guillaume traveled to the Gene va Congr ess. Thus fa r he had been committed to general education of the workers most often by means of history lectures (which later fo und their way into print) but also by means of dabb ling in organizing coop erative credit and consumer coop erativ es. He also played an acti ve part in the political and par liamentary movement, but, like most of the Jura's Internation alists , he soon came to the conclusion that the worki ng class had nothing to gain from that. The Inter­ national 's Congress in Lausanne and the Cong ress in Gen eva of the League of Peace and Freedom, both held in 1867, modified Guillaume' s thinking prof oundly; in fa ct it was there that he came into contact with revol utionar­ ies from all over Europe and there that he was converted to universal social revol ution .

He was one of the most enthusiastic orators of that left, fo rmed at the Congress of Bas Ie, and which took shape as the authorit arians and anti-authoritarians parted compan y at the famous Congress in The Hague. When it comes to the devel opment of Guill aume's ideas, then , setting on one side his person al capa bilities, both intelle ctual and mor al, one cannot overstate the importance of the happiness he derived fr om living and operating among a working class whose spiritual activity was out of the or dinary. It is hard to distinguish what Guillaume gave his comr ades from what he received fr om them . The Jura militants of that day truly were welded into one huge conf ession : they felt in common, thought in common and operated in common. They had no leaders and no led: only men of greater or lesser resolution and initiative, naturall y gifted to a greater or lesser extent. But it wou ld be a vain undertaking to try to establish where the work of one begins and where the work of another ends . 244 JAM ES GUIL LAU ME"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"In this way, Guillaume became the intellectual emanation of a collecti ve ( .. . ) There , in the Jura, the watch-makers and Guillaume together produced ideas which a later generation would redisco ver and rename as revo lutionary syndicalism. From 1870 onwards, one can discern a clear opposition in western Swit­ zerland between the two tendencies today described as social democ ratic and revolu tionary syndic alist. The first fa lling -out came in 1870, at the Congress of the Federation Romande in La Chauxde-Fonds: what was to occur on a larger scale in 1912 was seen there in micr ocosm. Guillaume was then editor of the organ of the \"collec tivists\" (revol utionary syndi calists ), La Solida ritc, which survived until after the Commune and the crisis which then assailed the Jura ssians. Later, he was editor of the Bu llet in , which replaced La Solida rite. After the slaughter of the Commune, the conflict between authorit arian and anti-authorit arian inside the International grew more acute than ever. Marx attacked the anti-authori tarians and especia lly the Jurass ians, at the London Conf erence . The upshot was that all anti-authorit arian elements were drawn together into even closer assoc iation , and hostilities worsened. We know that Bakunin and Guillaume were expelled from the International at the Cong ress in The Hague in 1872, when Marx and his colleagues reck­ oned that they had rid themse lves of the anti- auth oritar ians' leading lights. This is not the place to go into the methods to which Marx resorted in order to encom pass this end: the details of that can be fo und in Guil laume's I.: Inte rnati onale. 2 Even prior to The Hague, Guillaume had been to the fo re, but, after that Congress, it becomes quite impossible to understand the subsequent deve lop­ ment of the International without him. The opposition fa cing Marx was a very motley crew; and if that opposi­ tion was to be fo cused and maintained, there was a need fo r an open min d capa ble of taking cognizance of lots of diverse personalit ies, if a concerted effort was to be fe asible. Such was the role which Guill aume understood and performed so marvelousl y. The rarest of gifts in men , that, on the one hand, they should have clear, firm ideas of their own , and, on the othe r, that they should be able to accommoda te themse lves to the ideas of men differing from them and give them their due, was what set Guilla ume apart . This is why he was so active in the intellectual strife within the Internat ional. Indeed, in every thing he says and writes, one can sense an outstanding moral presence, equall y fr ee of fa naticism and of eclecticism.

FOREWORD Implementation of the ideas set out in the pages about to be read can onl y be achie ved by means of a revolu tionary move ment. It is not in one day that waters rise to the point where they can breach the dam holding them back: the waters rise slowly and by degr ees: but once they have reached the desired level, the collapse is sudden, and the dam crum bles in the blinking of an eye. There are, thus, two phenomena in succession, of which the second is the necessar y cons equence of the first: first, the slow cOllversion of ideas, needs and methods of action within the society; then, when the moment comes when this conversion is fa r enough adva nced to be translated entirely into deeds, comes the abrupt and decisi ve crisis, the revol ution, which is merely the culmi nation of a protracted evol ution, the sudden manif estation of a change a long time in the hatching and become inevita ble. It will not occur to any serious-minded person to signal in advance the ways and means whereby the revo lutio n, that indispensa ble overtur e to the over hauling of society, must be carried out. A revolution is a natural phe­ nomenon, not the act of one or of several individual wills; it does not operate in accordance with any pre-determined scheme, but comes about through the uncon trolla ble impulse of necessities which no one may command. So do not look to us fo r an outline revol utionary plan of campaign: we leave such childishness to those who still believe in the possibility and efficacy of a personal dictatorshi p in encom passing the work of human emancipation.

That character has to be above all else negative and destruc tive. It is not a matter of improving certain institutions from the past so as to adapt them to a new society, but rather of suppre ssing them .

Guerin JAM ES GUIL LAUME 247"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"the revol ution: it is the workers' assum ption of ownership of the instrum ents of labor and of all capital. We ought to explain how we envisage this assumption of ownership . First, let us speak of the land and the peasants. In several countr ies, but particular ly in France, the bourgeois and the clergy have long soug ht to gull and frighten peasants by telling them that the revolution aimed to take away their lands. This is a fo ul lie by the enemies of the people . The Revol ution seeks the very opposite: it aims to wrest the land fr om the bourg eois, the nobles and the clergy, in order to bestow it upon those among the peas ants who have none . If a tract belongs to a peasant, and that peasant works it himself , the revolu­ tion will not touch it. On the contra ry, it will guarantee him fr ee possession of it, and will release him fr om all charges weighing upon it. The land that paid a levy to the exchequer, and which was bur dened by heavy mortg ages, the revolution will emancipate just as it emancipates the worke r: no more levie s, no more mortgage s; the land be comes fr ee again, as does the man. As fo r the lands of the bourgeois, the nobles and the clergy and the lands which the rural poor have tilled to this day fo r their masters , the revol ution will wrest these back fr om those who stole them and restore them to their rightf ul owners, to those who cultivate them. What will the revo lution do in order to seize the land fr om the bour geoisie, the exploiters and give it to the peas ants? To date, whenever the bour geois made a political revol ution, whenever they mounted one of these move ments of which the sole upshot was that the people had a change of masters , they were wont to issue decrees and proc laim the wishes of the new government to the country: the decree was posted up in the communes, and the prefect, the courts, the mayor and the gendarmes saw to its implementation . The authentica lly popular revolu tion will not be fo llowing that example: it will not draf t decree s, will not require the services of the police and of the government administration. Not with decr ees, with words written upon paper, does it seek to emanci pate the people, but with deeds. II. THE PEASANT S In this chapter we shall be examining the manner in which the peasants must orga nize themse lves in order to extract maxim um possi ble profit from their 248 JAM ES GUIL LAU ME"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"instr ument oflabor, the soil. In the wak e of the Revol ution, here is the position in which the peasants will find themse lves: some, who alread y had been small proprietors , retain the parcel ofland which they carry on cultivating unaided, along with their family. Others , and these are the greater number, who were tenants of some big landlord, or mere waged laborers of some fa rmer, will have joined fo rces to seize a huge tract ofland, and should cultivate it in common. Which of these two arrangements is the better? It is not a matter here of theorizing, but of taking the fa cts as our point of departur e and establishing what is practica ble imm ediately. Appr oaching it from that angle , let us say fo r a start that the essential thing, the thing fo r which the Revol ution has been made, has been achiev ed: the land has beco me the property of him who works it, the peasant no longer toils in order to profit an exploiter who lives off his sweat. This great gain made, the rest is of secon dary importan ce: the peasants may, should they so desire, divide the land into individual lots and assign one lot to each worker, or they may instead take the land under comm on owner ­ ship and band together to work it. However, although it may be secondary by comparison with the essential fact, the emancipation of the peasant, this matter of the best way to approach cultivation and ownership of the soil is also deserving of attentive scrutiny. In a region which , prior to the Revol ution, would have been peopled by peasant small-holders; where the nature of the soil is not such as to favor large hold ings; where agric ulture still clings to methods from the days of the patriarchs or where use of machin ery is unknown or not widespre ad-in a region like that, it will be natural that the peas ants should cling to the form of property to which they are accustomed. Each of them will carry Oil worki ng his holding as he did in the past, with this sole differenc e, that his erstwhile servants (if he had any) will have become his colleagues and will share with him the fr uits extracted from the land by their common ef fo rt. Yet, the probability is that after a little while, these peas ants who stayed small -holders will see the advantage to thems elves of amending their traditi onal working arran gement . To start with, they will combine in order to set up a communal agency charged with sale or exchange of their prod uce: then that initial combination will lead them to essay others not along the same lines . They will act in comm on to acquire various machines designed to fa cilitate their labors; they will assist one another in performance of certain tasks better JAM ES GUI LLAU ME 249"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"performed when carried out quickl y by a large number of hands, and they will doubtless end up imitating their brethren, the workers of industry and those from the large holdings, by deciding to pool their lands and fo rm an agricultural association. But they will cling to the old routine fo r some years, and even though a whole generation may elapse in certain commu nes before the peas­ ants resolve to adopt the collecti ve ownershi p fo rmat, that delay will not pose any serious inconvenience; would that not be an end of the rural proletariat, and even within the comm unes clinging to the past, would there be anything other than a popul ation of free workers living amid plenty and peace? On the other hand, where big estates, and vast holding s account fo r a con­ sider able number of workers, whose concer ted and co mbined efforts are neces­ sary fo r the soil to be worked, collective owner ship prevails unaided. We will see the territory of an entire commune, sometimes even of sever al communes, composing only one agricultural venture , where the method s of large-scale fa rming will be fo llowed. In these huge, farm-workers ' comm unities, there will be no attem pt, as the small peasant strives today upon his little parcel of land, to extract a host of different products from the same soil; we will not see, side by side, within the compass of a single hectar e ofland, a little stand of wheat, a little stand of potat oes, another of vines, another of fo rage, another of fr uit trees, etc. By virtue of its external configuration, its exposure and its chemical com position, every soil has a special disposition fo r one variety of prod uce: thus, there will be no sowing of wheat on land suited to vines, no attempt to wrest potatoes from soil that would be better employed as pasture. Should it have land of just one sort, the agricultural comm unity will engag e only in the cultivation of one sort of produc e, in the knowledge that cultivation on a large scale brings much more considerable results v,:ith less labor, and it will opt to secur e the produce it needs through exch ange, rather than produce only a small crop of inferior quality from soil not suited to the purpose. The internal organization of an agricultur al community is not necessaril y going to be the same everyw here: there may be a rather wide variety accor d­ ing to the preferences of the combined worke rs; provided that they abide by the principles of equal ity and justice, they need consider only conv enience and usefulness in this connection. The manag ement of the comm unity may be conf erred upon either a single individua l, or upon a panel of several members elected by all of the membership: it will even be fe asible fo r various admini strative fu nctions to be separated, each one entrusted to a special commission. The length of the 250 JAM ES GUIL LAU ME"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"working day will be fixed, not by some general law appl icable nation- wide , but by decision of the community itself: the only thing is that, as the com­ munity is to be in contact with all of the agricultural workers of the region , it has to be accepted as likely that an agreement will be reached among all the workers upon the adoption of a standard practice on this score. The products oflabor belong to the comm unity and from it each member receiv es, either in kind (subsisten ce, clothing, etc.) or in exchange currency , remuneration fo r the la bor performed by him. In some associa tions , such remuneration will be in proportion to hours worked; elsewhere, it will refle ct both hours worked and the nature of duties performed; still other arrang ements may be tried and put into prac tice. This matter of distribution be comes quite a seco ndary issue, once the ques­ tion of ownership has been settled and there are no capital ists left to batten upon the labor of the masses . We reck on, however, that the princi ple to which we should seek to appro ximate as close ly as possible is this: FROM EACH ACCORD­ ING TO ABILITY, TO EACH ACCO RDING TO NEEDS. Once- thanks to mechanical methods and the advances of indus trial and agricultural science- production has been so increased that it fa r outstrips the needs of society -and that result will be achieved within a fe w years of the Revolution-once we are at that point, shall we say, there will be an end of scrupulous measuring of the portion due each worker: each of them will be able to dip into the abundant social reserve , to meet all of his requi remen ts, without fe ar of ever exhausting it, and the moral senti ment which will have grown up among free and equal workers will prevent abuse and waste. In the interi m, it is fo r each community to determine fo r itself during the transitional period, the method which it conside rs most approp riate fo r distributing produce among its members . III. THE INDUSTRIAL WORKER S As with the peasants, there are several categories to be distinguished among the workers of indus try. For a start, there are trades in which tools are virtua lly insignificant, where the division oflabor is non-existent or just barely exists, and where, as a result, the individual worker can produce every bit as well as he would were he to work in concert. The prof essions of tailor, cobbler, etc., fo r exam ple, fit that bill.! Then there are the trades requiring cooperation of several workers , re­ cour se to what is described as collec tive power, and which are generally JAM ES GUIL LAUME 251"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"fo llowed in a workshop or chapel: the prin twork ers, cabinet-makers and masons are example s. Finall y, there is a third category of industr y, where division of labor is taken much fu rther, where production takes place on a mammoth scale and requires use of mighty machines and access to consi derable capital. Exam ples are weaving, the metal- working plants , collieries, etc. In the case of workers belonging to the first category, collective labor is not a necess ity: and it will doubtless happ en that in many cases, the tailor or cobbler may prefer to go on working alone out of his little shop . This is quite a natural thing, espec ially as in the smaller communes, there may be perhaps only a single worker belonging to each of these trades . Yet, and while not wishing to trespass in the least against the independence of the individual, our reckoning is that, where fe asible, working in common is better: in the company of his equa ls, the worker has the incentive of emulati on: he produces more , and plies his trade with more heart : in addition, working in common fa cilitates more useful monitoring of the whole by the individual, and of the individual by the who le. As fo r the workers of the two other categor ies, obviousl y com bination is fo rced upon them by the very nature of their toil: and as their instruments of labor are no longer simple tools fo r personal use only, but rather machines or tools, the use of which requires collaboration of several workers , ownership of that e q uipment cann ot be other than collec tive . Every workshop , every fa ctory will theref ore represent a workers' associa­ tion which will remain at liberty to administer itself howsoever it may see fit, as long as the rights of the individ ual are safeguarded and the pri nciples of equality and justice put into practi ce. In the preceding chapter, aprop os of the agricultural workers' associa tions or communities, we offered, with regard to man agement, duration of working hours and distribution of produc e, ob­ servations which are of course equall y applica ble to workers in industr y, and which, as a result, we need not repeat. We have just said that, whereso ever we have an industry requiring somewhat complicated equipment and work ing in common, there had to be common ownership of the instru ments oflabor. But there is something that needs to be dete rmined: is that comm on property to belong exclus ively to the workshop where it operat es, or should it instead be the property of the whole body of the workers of this or that industry? Our view is that the latter of these solutions is the right one. When, fo r instance, come the Revol ution, the printworkers of the city of Rome assume possess ion of all of that city's prin twor ks, they ought imm ediat ely to meet 252 JAM ES GUIL LAU ME"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"in general assembly, there to declare that the range of printworks in Rome const itutes the common property of all Rome's prin twork ers. Then, as soon as possible , they ought to take another step, and show solidarity with the print­ workers of the other towns in Italy: the outcome of this solid arity agreement will be the establishment of every printing works in Italy as collecti ve property of the fe deration ofltalian prin twork ers. Through this communalization, the printw orkers right across Italy will be able to go and work in any of the towns in the countr y, and be assured of finding there the instrum ents of labor of which they will be entitled to avail. But whereas, in our view, ownership of the instruments of labor ought to be vested in the corporation, we do not mean to say that, above the teams of workers making up the workshop s, there is to be a sort of industrial government empowered to dispose of the instruments oflabor as it deems fit. No: the workers of the various workshops do not at all abandon the instruments oflabor captured by them to the care of a higher power called the corporation. What they do is this: under certain conditions, they mutually guarantee one another usufr uct of the instrument oflabor of which they have gained possession, and, by affording their colleagues fr om other workshops a joint share in that power, they receive, in return, a joint share in the ownership of the instruments oflabor in the care of the colleagues with whom they have entered into the solidarity agreement. IV. THE COMMUNE The commune comprises the body of workers resident in the same local ity. Taking as our model the commune, such as it exists in the vast majority of cases, and overlo oking the exceptio ns, let us define the comm une-as the local fe deration of producers' grou ps. This local fe deration or commune is established with a view to fu rnishing certain services which are not the sole preserve of one corp oration or another , but which affect them all, and whic h, fo r that very reason , are known as public servic es. Comm unal public services can be summarized under the fo llowing headings : A. PUBLIC WORKS' All homes are the property of the commune. Once the Revol ution has been made, everyone carries on, temporaril y, living in the same lodgings as before, with the exception of those fa milies JAM ES GUIL LAUME 253"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"who were consigned to unhe althy or much too inadequate homes, and who are to be lodged immedi ately, through the good offices of the commune, in vacant apartments of homes previou sly the property of the rich. The construction of new homes , cont aining healthy, spacious and COmi(l ft­ able lodgings, by way of replacement fo r the squalid hovels in the old popular distric ts, will be one of the prime tasks of the liberated society. The commune will turn its attention to this immedi ately, and in so doing, it will not only be able to supply work to the masons', carp enters', locksmiths' and roofers' corporatio ns, etc., but will also readil y find useful occupa tion fo r that mass of fo lk who, living a life of idleness prior to the Revol ution, have no trade; these can be employed as laborers on the huge building and excavat ion sites which will then open all over the liberated region, particular ly in the towns. These new lodgings are to be erected at everyo ne's expense -w hich means that, in return fo r labor performed by the various construction trade s, the latter will receive fr om the commune the exchange bonds needed fo r them to be able largely to subsidi ze the upkeep of all their members . And since the housing will have been erected at the expense of all, it will have to be acces sible to all which is to say that access to it will be fr ee of charge, and that no one will be requ ired to pay a levy or rent in return fo r the apartment he is to occupy. Accomm odations being tree of charge , it seems that serious disagre ements may arise from that, because no one will be willlllg to hold on to poor lodg ings and everybody will be squa bbling over the best ones . But we th ink that it would be wrong to think that serious problems would arise on that score, and here is the reason why. First, we ought to say that unwillingness to live in poor accom ­ mod ations and yearning fo r better is assured ly a very legitimate desire : and it is precise ly that desire , that we shall see arise very t(lrcef ully, which affords us an assuran ce that there will be vigorous steps taken everywhere to satisfY it, throug h the building of new homes. But until such time as they have been built, we will indeed have to be patient and make do with existing stock: as we have said, the commune will have taken care to meet the most pressing needs by lodging the poorest fa milies in the airy mansions of the rich: :llld, as fo r the remainder of the popu lation, we believe that revolutionary enthusiasm will have engendered a feeling of unselfishness and self .. denial which will ensure that everyo ne will be happy to bear, fo r a little while yet, the discom forts of unsuitable accommodations, and that it will not occur to anyone to take issue with a more fo rtunate neighbor who may, tempor arily, have 1110re agreeable acco mmodations . After a short while, thanks to the vigor with which the builders, under the stimu- 254 JAM ES GUIL LAUME"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Ius of widespread demand, will work, accommodations will become so plentiful, that every demand can be met: everybod y will merely have to choose, in sure and certain knowledge that accommodation to his taste will be forthcoming. What we say here is not at all as fanciful or wondrous as it might appear to those whose gaze has never looked beyond the horizon of bourgeois society: instead, it could not be simpler or more natural, so natural that it would be impossible for things to happen otherwise. In effect, with what ought the le­ gions of masons and other construction workers to busy themselves, other than endlessly building comfortable accommodations truly worthy of occupation by the members of a civilized society? Will they need to build for years on end, before every family has its own? No. It will be a short-lived endeavor. And once they have finished, are they to fold their arms? No, of course not: they will carry on working: they will improve and refurbish existing stock, and graduall y we will see the dismal districts, the narrow lanes, the unfit housing in our present towns disappearing: in their place will be erected mansions accomm odating workers restored to their manhood. B. EXCHANGE In the new society, there will be no more commer ce, in the sense attached to that term today. Every commune will establish an exchange agency, the workings of which we are about to explain as clearly as possible. The workers' associations, as well as individual producers (in the sectors where individual production may continue) will deposit their products with the exchange agency. The value of these various products will have been fixed in advance by agreement between the regional trades federations and the various communes, on the basis of inf ormation which statistics will afford. The exchange agency will issue producers with exchange vouchers to the value of thei r products: these exchange vouchers will be acceptable currency throughout the whole territory of the Federation of communes. Among the products thus deposited with the exchange agency, some are destined for use in the commune itself, and others for export to other com­ munes, and thus for, barter against other products. The former among these products will be shipped to the different commu­ nal bazaars, for the establishment of which temporary recourse will have been had to the most convenient of the shops and stores of the former merchants. JAMES GUIL LAUME 255"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Of these bazaars, some will be given over to fo odstuf fs , other s to clothing, others to hous ehold goods, etc. Products destined fo r export are to remain in the general stores, until such time as they are despatched to communes which are in need of them. Here let us pre-empt one objection . We may perhaps be told: by means of exchange vouchers, the exchange agency in every commune issues the pro­ ducers with a token of the value of their produce, and that before it has any assur ance of those same products \"mo ving.\" Should the products not \"move ,\" where would that leave the exchange agency? Might it not risk incurring losses, and is not the sort of operation entrusted to it high risk? Our answer to that is that every exchange agency is confident in advance that the products it receives will \"move,\" so that there cannot be any problem with its promptly issuing producers with their value in the fo rm of exchange vouchers . There will be certain categories of workers who will fm d it materiall y impossible to bring their produc ts into the exchange agency: construction workers are one such example. But the exchange agency will nonethele ss serve them as an interme diary: they will register there the various works they will have completed, the value of which will at all times have been agreed before­ hand, and the agency will issue them with exchange vouchers to that value. The same will be true of the various workers employed in the commu ne's admini strative services: their work takes the fo rm, not of manuf actur ed prod­ ucts, but of services rendered; these services will have been cos ted in advance and the exchange agency will issue them with the value of them . The exchange agency's fu nction is not just to recei ve products brought to it by the commune's workers : it liaises with other comm unes, and brings in prod ucts which the comm une is fo rced to secure fr om outside, either to supplement their diet, or as raw materi als, fuel, manuf actu red prod ucts, etc. Such products drawn from outside are displa yed in the communal stores, alongside local prod uce. Con sumers arrive at these various stores, brandishing their exchange vouchers, which may be split up into coupons of differing values: and there, on the basis of a standard tariff, they obtain all of the consumer items they may need. So fa r, the account we have offered of the oper ations of the exchange agency does not diffe r in any essential from cu rrent commercial practice: in fa ct, those operations are nothing more than purchase and sale transac tions : the agency buys produce from the producers and sells consu mers consumer 256 JAM ES GUIL LAU ME"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"items. But we reckon that after a while, the exchange agencies' practices may be amended without any drawback, and that gradually a new arrangement will supplant the old: exchange proper will fade away and make room for distribution pure and simple. Here is what we mean by that: As long as a product is in short supply, and is found in the communal stores only in quantities smaller than the consum ers could cope with, then one is obliged to introduce a measure of rationing into distribution of the item: and the easiest way to enforce rationing on consum ers is to sell them the item, which is to say, to make it available only to those who will offer a certain price in return. But once, thanks to the prodigious expansion of production which will inevi tably ensue as soon as work is organized along rational lines-once, shall we say, thanks to that expansion, this or that class of product far exceeds what the population could consum e, then it will no longer be necessary to ration consum ers; the sale transaction, which was a sort of brake upon im­ moderate consumption, can be dispensed with: the communal agencies will no longer sell products to consumers, but will distribute to them in accordance with the requirements claimed by the latter. This substitution of distribution for exchange can be effected shortly in re­ spect of all basic necessities: for the initial efforts of the producer s' associations will be focused above all upon plentiful production of those items. Soon, other items, which today are still hard to come by and expensive, and are, as a result, regarded as luxury items, can, in their turn, go into large-scale production, and thus enter the realm of distribution, which is to say, of widespread consump­ tion. On the other hand, other items, few in number and oflittle importance (say, pearls, diamonds, certain metals) can never become commonplac e, because nature itself limits availability; but as the high repute they enjoy today will no longer be attributed to them, they will scarcely be sought after, other than by scientific associations eager to deposit them in natural history museums or to use them in the manufactur e of certain instruments. c. FOODSTUFFS The provision offoodstuffs is, in a way, only ancillary to the exchange facility. Indeed, what we have just been saying about the exchange agency is applicable to all products, including products specially destined for use as foodstuffs. However, we deem it useful to add, in a special paragraph, some more detailed explanation of arrangements to be made regarding distribution of the chief JAMES GUILLAU ME 257"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"fo od prod ucts. Today, the bakery, butch ery, wine trade and colonial produce trade are at the mercy of private industry and speculators, who, through all sorts offrauds, seek to enrich themse lves at the consu mer's expen se. The new society will have to remedy this state of affairs imm ediate ly, and that remed y will consist of elevating to the status of communal public service anything having to do with distribution of essential fo odstuf fs . Let careful note be taken here : this does not mean that the commune com­ mandeers certain branches of produc tion. No: produ ction proper rema ins in the hands of the producers' associations. But in the case, say, of bread, of what does production comprise? Of nothing except the grow ing of the whe at. The fa rmer sows and harvests the grain, and delivers it to the communal exchange: at which poin t the fu nction of the producer is at an end. Grinding that grain into flour , turning the flour into bread no longer have anything to do with prod uction; it is work com parable with the work performed by the various employe es of the communal store s, work designed to make a fo od produc t, wheat, acces sible to the consu mers . The same goes for beef, etc. So we can see: from the point of view of principle, ther e cannot be anything more logical than reincorporating the bakery, butcher y, wine trade , etc., into the remit of the commune. As a result, wheat, once it reaches the commune's shop s, is to be ground into flour in a comm unal mill (it goes without saying that several communes may shar e the same mill ): the flour is to be turned into bread in communal bakeries, and the bread will be issued to consum ers by the commune. The same will be true in the case of meat: animals will be slaughtered in the communal abattoir s and butchered in the communal butcherie s. Wines will be stored in the communal cellars and issued to consum ers by specialist staff. Finall y, other fo od crops will, according to whether they are fo r more or less immediate cons umption, be stored in the commune stores or displayed in the markets, where cons umers may come in search of them. It is primar ily with regar d to th is category of produc ts, bread, meat, wine, etc., that every effort will be made to supplant the exch ange arrangement with the distr ibution arrangement as quickly as possi ble. Once everyone can be assured of plentif ul fo od suppl y, progress in the scien ces, industrial arts and civilization in general will make giant strid es. 258 JAM ES GUIL LAUME"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"D. STATISTICS The communal statistical commission will have charge of collating all statistical information affecting the commune. The various production associations or bodies will keep it constantly up to date with the size of their membership and with changes to their personnel, in such a way that instantaneous information may be available regarding the numbers employed in various branches of production. Through the good offices of the exchange agency, the statistical commis­ sion will secure the most comprehen sive data regarding production figures and consum ption figures. It will be through the statistics thus collected from all of the communes in a region, that it will be possible to strike a scientific balance between production and consum ption: by working to such information, it will be possible to add to the numbers employed in branches where production was inadequate, and to re-deploy in those where productivity is excessive. It will also be thanks to them that we will be able to determine-granted not absolute ly, but with sufficient practical accuracy-the relative worth of various products, which will serve as the basis for the exchange agencies' tarim. But that is not all: the statistical commission will still have to perform the tasks currently within the remit of the civil state; it will register births and deaths. We will not say marriag es, because, in a free society, the willing union of man and woman will no longer be a formal act, but rather a purely private act in need of no public sanctioIl. Lots of other things fall within the statistical remit: diseases, meteorologi­ cal observations, in short, everything which, happening on a regular basis, is susceptible to registration and calculation, and from the statistical analysis of which some information, and occasionally even some scientific law may be deduced. E. HYGIENE Under the general heading of hy giene we have classed sundry public services the good operation of which is crucial to the maintenance of community health. Pride of place has to go, of course, to the medical service, which will be made accessible by the commune free of charge to all of its mem bers.

That is the fu nction of hygi ene proper ly so called. We might go on to cite still other matters which should hold the atten­ tion and fa ll within the remit of the hygiene commission, but what little we have just said must by now be enough to give some idea of the natur e of its fUllctions and their importanc e. f. SECURITY This service takes in measures necessary in order to guarantee the personal security of every inhabitant of the commune, as weI] as protect buildings, prod uce, etc., against any depredation and misadventure. It is unli kely that there will still be instances of theft and banditry in a society wher e everyone will be able to live fr eely upon the fr uits of his labor, and will find all of his requirements met in fu ll. Material well-b eing as well as the intellectual and moral uplift that will result from the truly humane training afforded to all, will in any case mak e much rarer the sort of crimes that are the products of debauc hery, anger, brutality or othe r vice,.

This service, which might -had the term not an excessi vely erroneous implic ation -be described as the commu ne's police, will not be entrusted, as it is toda y, to a specialist corps; every inhabit ­ ant will be liable to partici pate in it, and to take turns in the various secu rity positions which the commune will have estab lished. Here no doubt, there will be speculation as to the treatment to be meted out in an egalitarian society to someone guilty of murder or other violent offenses. Obviousl y, a murderer cannot be allowed to go blithe ly on his way, on the pretext of respectin g the rights of the individ ual and rebutting author­ ity, nor can we wait fo r some fr iend of the victim to claim a life tor a life. He will have to be denied his fr eedom and kept in a special establishm ent until such time as he can be returned safely to socie ty. How ought he to be treated during his captivity?

G. T HE CHILD IS NO ONE ' S PROPERTY \" The first point to be consi dered is the question of the upkeep of children. Today, it is the parents who are char ged with seeing to the nouri shment and education of their childr en; this practice is the result of a bad practice which looks upon the chil d as parental prope rty. The child is no one's prop erty , but belongs to itself ; and fo r the duration of the period when he is still inca pable oflooking to his own protection , and when, as a result, he may be exposed to exploita tion, it is up to soci ety to protect him and guarantee his unh indered deve lopment. It is up to soci ety, too, to see to his upke ep: by subsidizing his consum ption and the sundry costs incurred by his educat ion, soci ety is simply advancing him money which the child will reimburse through his labor once he becomes a producer. Thus , it is socie ty, and not paren ts, that should look to the upkeep of the child. That general pri nciple accepted, we believe that we should refrain from prescribing in any precise and detailed way the fo rm in which it should be implemen ted; we should be risking a lapse into utop ianism; we must give freedom a chance and await whatever experience has to teach . Let us say only that with regard to the child, society is represented by the commune and each commune will have to decide upon the arrangement it deems best with regard to the upkeep of its childr en: in some places, pref erence will be given to the common life, elsewhere the children will be left to their mothers , up to a certain age at any rate , etc. But this is only one fa cet of the question. The commune fe eds, clothes and houses its children : who is to teach them, who will make men and producers of them? And accor ding to which scheme will their education be administer edl To snch questions our answer will be: children's education should be round­ ed, which is to say that it should develop simultaneou sly al\\ bodily fa culties and all intellectual ones, so as to turn the child into a rounded adult. This JAMES GUILLAUME 261"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"education should not be entrusted to a special teacher caste: everyone \\\\'ho has a science, an art or a trade to offer can and should be invited to impart it. Two levels are to be di stinguished in education: one when the child, be­ tween the ages of five and twelve years, has not yet attained the age to study the sciences, and when essentially it is a question of developing his physical attributes, and a second level when the child, aged between twelve and sixteen years, should be introduced to the several branches of human knowledge, wh ile also learning the practice of one or several branches of production. At the first level, as we have said, essentially it will be a matter of developing the child's physical faculties, strengthening the body and exercising the senses. Today, the task of exercising the vision, training the ear or developing manual dexterity is left to chance; by contrast, rational education will, by means of spe­ cial exercises, set about making the eye and the ear as powerful as they have the potential to be; and, as for the hands, great care will be taken not to accustom children to being right-handed only: an effort will be made to make them as dextrous with the one hand as with the other. At the same time as the senses are being exercised, :ll1d bodily vigor boosted by means of clever gymnasti cs, a start will be made on the cu ltivation of the mind, but in a quite spontaneous way: the child's head will be filled automati­ cally by a number of scientific facts. Personal observation, experienc e, conversations between children, or with the individuals charged with supervising their instruction will be the only lessons they will receive during this stage. The school governed arbitrarily by a pedagogue, where the pupils sigh for freedom and outdoor games, is to be done way with. In their assemblies, the children will be completely free: they themselves will organize their games, their get-togethers and will establish a panel to oversee their work and ar­ bitrators to resolve their squ abbles, etc. In this way, they will grow used to public life, accountabil ity, mutuality; the teacher whom they \\vill have chosen of their own free will to deliver their education will no longer be a despised tyrant but rather a friend to whom they will listen with pl easure. At the second level, the children, upon reaching the age of twelve or thirteen years, will, in a methodical way, study, one after another, the chiefbranches ofhu­ man learning. Instruction will not be entrusted to the care of men who will make it their sale occupation: the teachers of this or that science will simultaneo usly be producers who will spend part of their time on manual labor: and every branch will number, not one, but a very great number of men in the commune who are 262 JAMES GUIL LAUME"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"pmsessed of a sCIence and disposed to teach it. What is more, joint reading of good textbooks, and the discussions which will fo llow such reading will do much to redu ce the importance currently attached to the perso nality of the teacher. At the same time as the child is develo ping his bod y and absorbi ng the scien ces, he will serve his apprentic eship as a producer. In first level educat ion, the need to amend or modif y play materials will have initiated the child into the hand ling of the major tools . At the second level , he will visit a variety of worksho ps, and soon, he will choose one or several specializations fo r him self. His instructors will be the producers thems elve s: in every workshop, there will be pupils and a part of every worker's time will be devoted to demonstrating wor king procedures to them . To this practical instruction, a fe w theoretical lessons will be added. In this way, upon reaching the age of sixteen or seventeen years, the young man will have sam pled the whole range of human kno wledge and will be equipp ed to proceed alone to fu rther studie s, should he so wish; in additio n, he will have learned a trade, whereupon he will enter the ranks of the useful prod ucers , in such a way that, through his labor, he is able to repa y to society the debt he owes it for his education . It remains fo r us to say something about the child's re lations with his fa mily. There are people who contend that a social organization fo rmula that makes the child 's upkeep incum bent upon socie ty, is nothing short of \"destruction of the fa mily.\" That is a meaningless expressi on: as long as it requires the co­ operation of two individu als of opposite sex to procreate a new-b orn child, there will be fa thers and mothers , and the natural bond of kinship between the child and those to whom he owes his existence cannot be stricken from social relat ions. The character alone of this bond must neces saril y und ergo change. In ancient times, the tither was absol ute master of the child, enjoying the right of lif e or death over it: in modern times, the paternal authority has been limited by certain restriction s, so what could be more natural if, in a fr ee and egalitarian society, what rema ins of that authority should be complete ly eclipsed and give way to relations of unallo yed affection? We are not claiming, of cour se, that the child should be treated like an adult, that all of its tantrums command respect and that whenever its childish wishes conf lict with the rules established by science and common sense, the child should not be taught to yield. On the contrar y, we are saying that the child is in need of direction; but in its early years , that direction should not JAMES GUILLAUME 263"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"be vested exclusively in its parents, who are often incompeten t and generall y abuse the power vested in them. The object of the education received by the child being to equip it as quickly as possible for self-direction by comprehen­ sive development of all its facultie s, then obviousl y no narrowly authoritarian tendency is compatible with such a system of education. But because the rela­ tions of father and son will no longer be those of master and slave, but rather those of teacher and pupil, of older friend and younger one, is it conceivable that the mutual afTection of parent and child should su ffer by that? Is the op­ posite not the case when we will have an end of these enmities and frictions of which today's family has so many examples to offer, and which are almost always caused by the tyranny the father wields over his children? So, let no one corne along and say that the liberated, regenerated society is going to destroy the family. On the contrary, it will teach the father, mother, and child mutual love, mutual regard and respect for their mutual rights: and at the same time, above and beyond the family affections which encompass only a narrow circle and which sour if they remain exclusive, it will infuse hearts with a loftier, nobler love, love for the whole family of man. A FEDER ATIVE NETWORK Departing now from the narrow ground of the commune or local federation of producers ' groups, let us take a look at social organization as it is comple­ mented, on the one hand, by establishment of regional corporative federations embracing all workers' groups belonging to the same branch of production: and, on the other, by establish ment of a Federation of communes. ( . .. ) We have already indicated briefly what a corporative federation is. Within the bosom of the present society, there are organizations bringing all of the workers in a trade within the compass of the same association: the federation of typogra phical workers is one example. But these organizations are only a very flawed foretaste of what the corporative federation should be in the society to come. The latter will be made up of all producer groups be­ longing to the same branch oflabor; they band together. 110t, now, to prot ect their wages against the rapaciousness of the bosses, but primaril y in order to assure one another of use of the instruments oflabar in the possession of each of their groups and which, by mutual agreement, are to become collective property of the corporative federation as a whole; furthermore , by federating one with another , the groups are empowered to exercise a constant watching brief on production, and, as a result, to add to or subtract from the intensity 264 JAMES GUIL LAUME"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"thereof, in reflection of the needs manifested by society as a whole. Establishment of the corporative federation will be effected extremely simply. In the wake of the Revolution, the producer groups belonging to the same industry will be alive to the need to send delegates to one another, from one town to another, for fact-finding purposes and in order to reach accom­ modatio ns. Out of such partial conferencing will emerge the summoning of a general congress of the corporation's delegates to some central venue. That congress will lay the groundwork of the federative contract, which will then be put to all of the groups of the corporation for approval. A standing bureau, elected by the corporative congress and answerable to it, will be designed to act as intermediar y between the groups making up the federation, as well as between the federation per se and other corporative federations. Once all branches of production, including those affecting agricultural production, are org anized along such lines, a vast federative web, taking in every producer and thus also every consumer, will cover the country, and statistics regarding production and consumption , centralized by the bureau of the various corporative federations, will mak e it possible to determine in a rational way the number of hours in the normal working day, the cost price of products and their exchange value, as well as how many of these products have to be made in order to meet consum er demands. People accustomed to the empty bombast of certain alleged democrats may perhaps ask whether the workers' groups should not be called upon to take a direct hand, through a vote by all members of the corporati ve federation, in the settlement of these various details: And when we respond negatively, they will protest at what they will term the authority of the bureau, empowered to decide matters of such gravity for themselves and to take decisions of the highest importance. Our response will be that the task with which the standing bureau of each federation will have been charged has nothing to do with the wielding of any authority: in [let, it is simply a matter of collecting and collating information supplied by the producer groups: and once this inf(mnation has been gathered and made public, of deducing the necessary implications it holds for working hours, the cost price of products, etc. That is a simple arithmetical calcula­ tion, which cannot be done in two different ways or produce two different results: there is but one result possible from it; that result can be checked out by every person for himself, because everyone will have the data before him, and the standing bureau is simply charged with registering it and publishing it for all to see. Even today, the postal administration, say, performs a service JAMES GUIL LAUME 265"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"rather analogous with the one to be entrusted to the corporative federations' bureau, and it would not occur to anyone to complain of abuse of authority just because the post office should decide, without reference to universal suffrage, how letters arc to be classified and grouped into packets for delivery to their destination as speedily and economic ally as practicable. Let us add that the producer groups making up a federation will take a hand in the bureau's doings in a manner a lot more eHective and direct than mere voting: in fact, it is they who will supply the information , all the statisti­ cal data that the bureau merely collates, so that the bureau i, only the passive go-between by means of which groups communicate with one another and publicly register the results of their own ac tivities. The vote is a suitable means of settling matters that cannot be resolved on a scientific bas is, and which ought to be left to the whim of the balance of numbers, but in matters liable to precise scientific resolution, there is no need for a vote; truth is not balloted, it is si mply registered and then overwhelms everybody by virtue of its obviousne ss. But thus far we have shown only one of the facets of extra-communal organization: and alongside the corporative fedeLltions the federation of communes should be establish ed. NO SOCIALISM IN ONE COUNT RY The Revolut ion cannot be confined to a single country; on pain of death, it is obliged to subsume into its movement, if not the whole world, then at least a consider able portion of the civilized countrie s. Indeed, today no country can be sufficient unto itself: international relations are a necessity of production and consum ption, and they could not be severed. Should the neigh boring States around a country in revolution manage to impose an impregnable blockade, the Revolution, being isolated, would be doomed to perish. Thus, as we are speculating on the hypothesis of the Revolution succeeding in a given country, we must suppose that most of the countries of Europe will have made their revolution at the same time. It is not essential that the new social organization installed by the Revolu­ tion, in every land where the proletariat will have overthrown the rule of the bourgeoisie, should be the same in every particular. Given the differences of opinion which have thus far surfaced between the socialists of the Germanic countries (Germany, England) and those of the Latin and Slav countries (Italy, Spain, france, Russia), the likelihood is that the social organization adopted 266 JAMES GUILLAU ME"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"by the German revolutionaries, say, will differ on more than one count from the organization espoused by the Italian or French revolutio naries. But such differences have no bearing upon international relations; the basic principles being the same in both cases, relations of friendship and solidarity cannot but be established between the emancipated peoples of the various countries. It goes without saying that the artificial frontiers created by existing governments will collapse before the Revolution. Communes \\vill band together freely according to their economic interests, linguistic affinities and geographical situation. And in certain countri es, like Italy or Spain, which are too huge to form only one agglomeration of communes, and which na­ ture herself has split into several distinct regions, there will doubtless be, not one, but several Federations of communes set up. Which will not signify a breach in unity, a reversion to the old atomization into small, hostile, isolated political States; their interests will be all of a piece and they will enter into a pact of unity with one another, and this voluntary union, rooted in genuine usefulness, in a community of aims and needs, in ongoing exchange of good offices, will be tight and solid in a way quite different from the sham unity of political centralization established by violence and with no raison d'etre other than exploitation of the country for the benefit of one privileged class. The compact of unity will not be established only between the Federations of communes within the same country: the old political frontiers having become redundant, all of the Federations of communes, by and by, will enter into this fraternal alliance, and, once the principles of the Revolution have carried all be­ fore them in the whole of Europe, the great dream of the fraternity of peoples, achievable only by Social Revolution, will have become a reality.

Those were propitious times, for, between the ages of fifteen and twenty five, he witnessed the great liberal and radical awakening that came in the wake of Nicholas I's death; he saw natural science attain its apogee through the great works of Darwin and other contemporarie s, and his travels in Siberia greatly widened his horizons .

Finally, he realized his dream of 1872, to live in the Swiss Jura. where the intelligent, independent workers had done so much to sustain and spread anti-authori­ tarian ideas in the International.

Similarly, Paul Brousse drafted and wrote (for translati on) for the first German anarchist newspaper of that time which was published out of Berne. And in Guillaume's absence, he even edited the Blllletill JlIr<1ssicl l and passed the first article calling for \"propaganda by deed\" (in as many \\vords, too), an article penned by Paul 13rousse. A congress happened to take him to Belgium. to Verviers (in September 1877), but, in order to avoid harassment, he travekd to Paris. there to embark upon his research into the French Revolut ion. He nude a trip to Spain (summer 1878), to Barcelona and Madrid, and managed to smooth over a disagreement that divided Morago's terrorist group (Madrid) and Viilas's revolutionary syndicalist group (Barcelona): in point of fact, both these groups were anarchist. 272 PETER KROPOTK IN"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Paris at that time was none too hospitable towards anarchist International­ ists and he soon moved to Geneva. It was there that, at the beginning of1879, his favorite offspring, Le Revoite, was launched (on February 22) ( . .. ) There it was that he published that long series of articles , which might have appeared disconnected, in that they mir­ rored developments of the time, but which lent themselves so well to being collected into pamphlets published and translated times beyond number, before publication in book form as Paroles d'un Revolte, because the entire series had been thought out and written in accordance with a pre-arranged scheme. For a time to follow, Kropotkin's life was an eventful one. He was deported from Switzerland over an article which had been written by Cafiero. He spent another very bleak period in London , where he also attended the London International Revolut ionary Congress (in 1881). He was reduced to living in Thonon, in Savoy, unable to re-enter Switzerland and increasingly threatened on the French side where the vigor of anarchist propaganda in Paris and Lyon had triggered an urge to strike at its very heart through its most committed propaga ndists. Kropotkin too was caught up in this dragnet and was arraigned in the despicable trial in Lyon-the anarchists' declaration, drafted by him, is worth re-readi ng-and Clairvaux prison and, I think, the very same cell as the aged Blanqui, became his last fixed abode in France. Freed after several years under an amnesty at the start of 1886, he was able to stay only a short time in Paris, and for the next thirty years , he was to dwell in England, only to return to Russia in the spring of 1917, under Kerensk y.

In terms of propaganda, there was still La Re 1JO lt e - in which the series of informative articles collected under the title The Co nquest (:f Bread was pub­ lished: later, there was Les Te mps nouveaux. Soon there would be the English monthly Freedom, from October 1886 on. But there was another route by which he could develop his ideas. For years he had been writing about Russia, her revolution and her prisons, etc., in the Newcastle Chro nicle, penning letters to the Times and highly fastidious articles in Nineteenth Century.

But the important thing is, regardle ss of what its character may be, that the socialists of every country, capitalizing upon the disorganization of powers in time of revolution, should bend their every effort to achieving, on a large scale, a change in the property system, through plain and simple expropriation of the present owners oflarge landed esta tes, the instruments of labor and all sorts of capital, and through all such capital being taken over by the cultivators, the workers' organizations and the agricultural and municipal communes. The act of expropriation should be carried out by the workers of town and countryside themselves. It would be a profound error to wait for any govern­ ment to do it: for history teac hes us that governments, even when th ey have emerged from the revolution, have never done anything other than give legal sanction to acc omplished revolutionary facts, and indeed, that the people had to wage a protracted battle with these governments in order to wrest from them assent for the revolutionary measures for which it had been calling loudly over periods of restlessness. Moreover, a measure of that importance would remain a dead letter unless it had been freely implemented in every commune, in every stretch of territory, by the interested parties themselves. 3. The expropriation of social capital and the taking of it into common ownershi p should be carried out whereso ever such action is feasible and as soon as the opportunity presents itself, without inquiring into whether the whole or most of Europe or of such and such a country is ready to embrace the ideas of collectivism. The drawbacks which would ensue from partial realiza­ tion of collectivism will largely be made up for by its advantages.

Moreover, it would be tedious to go into a discu ssion of whether it may or may not be necessar y to wait until the ideas of collectivism have been accepted by the majority before putting them into practice , fo r it is certain, that unless they set thems elves up as a government which would shoot the people down, the doctrinarian socialists will not prevent expropriation from proceeding in those localities most advanced in terms of their socialist education, even should the great mass of the country remain in a cond ition of inertia. 4. Once expro priation has been carried through , and the capitalists' power to resist has been smashed, then, after a period of groping, there will neces sar­ ily arise a new system of organizing production and exch ange, on a restricted scale to begin with, but later more com prehens ive. and that system will be a lot more attuned to popular aspirations and the requi rements of coexistence and mutual relations than any theory, however splen did, devised either by the thinking and imag ination of reformers or by the deliberations of some legisla tive body. However, we believe that we are not mistaken in predic ting right now that, in franco phone Switzer land at least. the fo undations of the new orga niza tion will be the fr ee fe deration of producer s' groups and the free fe deration of Communes and groups of indep enden t Commun es. 5. Should the revolution set to work immediat ely upon expr opriation, it will derive fr om it an inner strength that will enable it to withstand both the attempts to fo rm a government that would seek to strangle it and any onslaughts which might emanate from without. But, even should the revolu tion have been beaten, or if expro priation has fa iled to spread to the extent we anticipated, a popular uprising launched on that basis would do humanity the immense service of acce lerating the advent of the social revol ution . While contributing (like all revolu tions ) a measure of immediate improv emen t to the lot of the proletariat, even if defeated, it would render impos sible thereaf ter any other uprising that would not have expropri ation of the lew fo r the benefit of the man y as its point of departure. A fu rther explosion would thus of necessity lead to an end of capitalist exploit ation , and, with the departur e of that, to economic and political equal ity, work fo r all, solid arity and liberty. 6. If the revolution is to bear all of the fr uits which the proletariat is en­ titled to expect of it after centuries of unceasing struggles and holocausts of 276 PETE R KRO POTK IN"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"victims sacrificed, then the period of revol ution must last fo r several years , so that the propagation of new ideas should not be confined solely to the great intellectual centers , but should reach even into the most isolated haml ets in order to shak e the inertia which is necessaril y evident in the masses prior to their turning towards a fu ndamental reor ganiza tion of societ y, so that, at long last, the new ideas should ha ve the time to be deve loped fu rthe r, as the true advancement of human ity requires. So, far from seeking to establish imm ediately and in place of the auth ori­ ties overthrown, some new authority which, having been born in the in itial stages of the revolu tion , when the new thinking is only just beginning to stir, would of neces sity be essentiall y cons ervative: far from aiming to create an authority which, repre senting phase one of the revol ution, could not help but hobble the fr ee development of subseq uent phases, and which would inevita­ bly tend to immobi lize and circumscri be, socialists have a duty to thwart the creation of any new gove rnm ent and instead to arouse those popular fo rces destruc tive of the old regime and at the same time generat ive of the new organization of society. 7. This being our conception of the coming revolution and the goal we in­ tend to achieve, it fo llows that during the preparatory period through which we are passing toda y, we ought to concentrate all of our efforts upon widespread propaganda on behalf of the idea of expropriation and of collecti vism. Instead of consigning these princi ples to some corner of our Ininds, and proceedi ng to talk to the people of nothing but the business of so-c alled politics (which would amount to an attempt to lay the mental grou ndwork fo r an eminently political revolu tion, palpably neglecting its economic aspect, the only one capable of investing it with sufficient strength ), we ought instead, ahvays and in every circumstance, to spell out those principles at length , demonstrating their practical implications and prov ing their necessity; we ought to make every effort to prepare the popular mind to embrace these ideas, which, odd though they may seem at first glance to those filled with politico-e conomic prejudice s, readil y become inco ntrovertible truth fo r those who discuss them in good fa ith, a truth which science is toda y beginning to grasp, a truth often ackno wledged by the very people who publicly resist it. Working along these lines, without letting ourse lves be dazz led by the momentary and often contrived success of the political parties, we work at infusing the masses with our ideas: all undetecta bly, we are effecting a shift of opinion in the direction of our ideas; we bring together the men we need PETER KRO POTKIN 277"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"to propa gate these ideas on a wide scale during the period of effervescence towards which we are striding: and we know from the experience of human history that it is precise ly in periods of effervescence, when dissemi nation and transf ormation of ideas takes place at a rate unknown in periods of tran­ sition, that the princi ples of expropriation and collectivism can spread like wildfir e and inspir e the broad masses of the people to put these princi ples into practice. S. If the revolu tionary period is to last fo r a number of years and if it is to bear fruit, it is absolute ly necessary that the coming revolution should not be restricted to the larger towns only: the uprising aimed at expro priation must take place primaril y in the countr yside. So there is a need to set about preparing the ground in the countryside right now and not rely upon the revol utionar y elan which might, in a period of effervesc ence, radiate fr om the towns into the villages. As a temporary stratagem and as an experiment, the Jura sections ought to make it their duty to undertake, in villag es adjacent to the town s, ongoing prop aganda in favor of expropriation of the land by the rural commun es. As there have been experi ments along these lines already, we are in a position to state that they have borne more fruit than had been expected at the outset. Trial and error will show the best way to proceed, and how this propaganda might b e extended. Difficult though thi n g s might be to begin with, a start should be made without fu rther delay. Furthermore , we could not recommend too highly that a study be made of the peasants' uprisings in Italy and the revolut ionary propaganda currently being conducted in the villages of Spain. 9. While urging that our efforts be conc entrated upon widespread propa­ gatio n, in all its fo rms, of the ideas of expro priation, we do not mean to say that we should miss opportunities to agitate on all matters pertinent to the life of the country and going on around us. On the contrary : we think that socia lists ought to avail of every opportunity that arises to launch economic agitation, and it is our conviction that every agitation launched upon the ter­ rain of the struggle of the exploited against the exploiters , however narrowly circu mscribed its initial theater of action, the aims it pursues and the ideas it advances, can prove ground fo r socialist agitation , unless it falls into the clutches of ambitious schemers . So it would be a good idea fo r sections not to scorn the various issues agitating the workers of the district fo r the sole reason that these matt ers have but very little to do with socialism. On the contrary, by taking a hand in 278 PETER KRO POTK IN"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"all these issues, and by capitalizing upon the interest which these arouse, we might work to broaden the scope of the agitation, and, while sticking to the practicalities of the matter, seek to broaden theoretical notions and awaken the spirit of independence and revolt in those taking an interest in the resul­ tant agitation. Such parti cipation is all the more necess ary in that it ofTers the only way of combat ing the wrong-he aded opinions peddled on every such occa sion by the bour geoisie, and of preventing the worke rs' agitation from going down a road absolut ely contrary to the workers' inter ests, as a result of activities carried out by ambitious perso ns. ro. As anarchists' efforts ought to be directed at undermining the State in all its parts, we cannot see the usefulness of our setting ourselves up as a political party which would strive to ensconce itselfin the ramifications of government, in the hope of one day claiming its share of the inheritance of the present govern mentalism. We belie ve that the best way of shaking this edifice would be to escalate the economic struggle . But we belie ve too that it wou ld also be a good idea to ha ve an eye out at all times fo r the acts and fe ats of those who govern us, to study dilig ently those political issues which interest the laboring people , and to let slip no favorable opportunity to point up the incom petence, hypocrisy and class self-interest of existing governments , as well as the vicious and noxious character of gove rnmental rule. Let us wage war on the State and its represent ative s, not so as to take a seat in its deliberations, as the political parties do, but in order to undermine the force they oppose to the worker's aspirations and in order to hasten their inevita ble downf all.

Convinced that the mode of combination that will become a reality in the near fu ture (in francophone Swiss territory at any rate) will be the Com­ mune, independent of the State, abolishing the repre sentative system from within its ranks and effecting exprop riation of raw materials, instrum ents of labor and capital fo r the benefit of the commun ity, we hold that there is a need fo r serious study of the collectivist Commune and discu ssion of the part which anarchists may play in the strug gle curr ently incubating on the political and econ omic terr ain, between the Communes and the State. PETE R KROPO TKIN 279"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE 1880 CONG RES S OF THE JU RA FEDERAT IO N The next year, 1880, saw a congress of the Jura Federation meet in Chaux ­ de-Fonds, in the Swiss Jura. Ever since the split in the worke rs' International at The Hague in 1872, the Jura Federation had acted as the spokesman fo r the \"anti- authoritarian\" libertarian socialis m inherited fr om Mikhail Bakunin. Below the reader will find: 1) Lengthy excerpts from the minutes of the congress carried in the Oc­ tober 17, 1880 edition of the newspaper Le Revolte, and, in particu lar, Kropotki n's contributio n. 2) Extracts from the memorandum (or \"progra m\") submitted to the cong ress by the Workers' Federation of the Courtelary District 1 3) Finall y, the report submitted to the congress by the Italian Carlo Cafiero, on the subject of \"Anarchy and Communism.\" These texts allow us to distinguish two divergent schools of thought within the Jura Federat ion: one, represented by Kropotkin, Cafiero, etc., openly professed libertarian comm unism. The other, more cautious and less ambi­ tious, whose spokesman was Adhemar Schwitzgucbel, still clung to use of the term collectivism .2 What was the difference bet\\veen these two tendencies? In theo ry, collec tivism merely wanted to see the means of production taken into comm on ownership and it left the workers' associa tions free to determine how the products of/abor might be distribute d, a fa culty \\vhich in fa ct boiled down to remuneration fo r labor being a fu nction of work performed. Libertarian com.mu nism, on the other hand, aimed to take into comm on ownership not just the means of production, but also consumer goods , and to distribute products thereaf ter in abundant supply on the market, free of charge, in accordance with the fo rmula: \"To each accord­ ing to his needs.\" This was what James Guilla ume had suggested back in 18 74. (See above) The objections to cOlll munism of the supporters of collectivism were pri­ maril y on grounds of opportun ity. As Adhcmar Schwitzgucb el, who professed 280 PETER KRO POTK IN"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"to be an anarchist-communist hims elf, said: \"Thus fa r, the comm unist idea has been misu ndersto od among the populace where there is still a belief that it is a system devoid of all liberty.\" Objections from the supporters oflibertarian communism inimical to the word collect ivism also derived from the fa ct that in 1880, the latter term had lost the sense which had commonl y been given to it in the First International. Reformists no longer understood collec tivism to mean taking of the instru­ ments oflabor into common ownership in a revolutionary and general way, but rather an evolutiona ry, parliamentary socialism. MINUTES OF THE JURA FEDERATION CONGRESS ( 1880) (EXT RAC TS) I ( . . . ) The congress was held in Chaux -de-Fo nds on October 9 and 10, 1880. Comrade Kropotkin reports, having attended a meeting of the Geneva section, that the latter held that the program was much too long to be made effective use of in popular propagand a. Moving on then to discu ssion of the program, he says that fo r some time past socialism has been in fashion, and even where one might least expect to hear it, people have been heard to say: \"We too are socialist s!\" We also have socialists of every hue, red and pink, blue and green, white and even black. All who ackno wledge the neces sity of some modification to the relations between capitalists and workers , however anodyne, have staked a claim to the descr iption socialists. We need not concern ourselves about those who claim to be socia lists with the specific object of hobbling socialis m's develop ment. Let us leave those to the side fo r one moment . But if we were to examine all the other schools of socialism -ref ormist, statist, demo cratic, etc.-and if we were to compar e them against anarchist socialism, we very readily perce ive one idea constituting a clear ly defined difference between these various schoo ls and us. Namely, our conce ption of the work which the revolution is due to carry out. Among all the evolu tionary socialists and even among some revolutionary socialists , there is one common notion. They do not believe in an imminent great revol ution, or indeed, if they do, they are persuaded that that revolution is not going to be a socialist revolu tion: \"Come the next uphea val,\" they say, \"the people is not going to be ready yet to carry out a serious revolut ion in the system of ownership: that is why the point is to first carry out a political PETER KROPO TKIN 281"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"revolution that will offe r every opportunity fo r prepa ring minds fo r a social revolution.\" If they are to be believed, it would theref ore only come v,·hen our great-gra ndchil dren are graybeards . Examine the writings of socialists of every persuasion and you will find that at bottom, they are dominated by this idea, regardless of the langu age they may use to disguise the fa ct. We could not protest too loudl y against this idea, whereby fa int-hearts strive in advance to set a term to the implications of the coming revol ution. It is our firm conviction that expropriation will be the goal and dri ving fo rce behind the next European conflict, and we ought to bend our every effort to ensuring that that expro priation becom es an accomplished fact fo llowing the battle which we can all sense drawing near. It is expro priation , carried out by the people and followed by the tremendous shift in thinking which it will bring in its wake , which alone can invest the coming revolu tion with the requisite power to overcome the obstacles being erected in its path. It is expro priation that will have to serve as the point of departure fo r a new era of social development. And even should the efforts of our enemies, abetted in this by men who would even now tell the people \"So fa r and no fu rther! \" succeed in defeating us, the very fa ct that we had made the attempt to take the whole of social capital and the products oflabor into comm on ownership, albeit only within a restricted space, would be a salutary example presaging the ultimate success of the fo llowing revol ution . Expropriation, carried out by the people, once an uprising has thrown the power of the bour geoisie into disarray: imm ediate seizur e by producer groups of the whole of social capital: that is how we shall act come the next revolu­ tion, and it is primar ily upon this point that we take issue with those schools of socialism which, at bottom, having no confidence in the people, seek to make the fo rthcoming revolu tion a mere change in the fo rm of government, some of them, under the pretext of establishing the freedoms necessary fo r the socialist idea to prosper, and others of them, under the pretext of carrying out expropriation gradual ly, in piecemeal fa shion, once they, the governmen ts, judge that the right time has arrive d. lfthe Federation embraces the idea put fo rward by the Geneva section, that a summary of our program be published, might it not be a good idea fo r that summary to make more plain and explicit this essential difference between our party and the evolntionary schools? Comrade Krop otkin fu rther observes that use of the word collectivism in the program might be open to misinterpret ation. 282 PETER KRO POTK IN"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"When that term was introduced into the Internati onal, it was invested with a meaning quite different from the one suggested by it toda y. With due consideration for the prejudices then existing in France against comm unism, which was understood to signif y a monastic order walled up in a convent or barracks, the International opted fo r the word collectivism. It also said that it wanted social capital to be taken into common ownership and groups to be com pletely fr ee to introduce whatever system fo r distri but­ ing the products oflabor they may regard as best suited to the circumstan ces. Today, an attempt is underwa y to imply that the word collectivism means something else: according to evol utionists, it mea ns, not the tak ing of the instrum ents of labor into common ownership, but rather individual enjoy­ ment of produ cts. Others go fu rther still and seek to restrict even the social capital which would have to be taken into common ownership: supp osedly, this would extend only to land, mines, fo rests and means of comm unication. Furthermore, collectivists of this stripe would be read y to defend it at gun­ point against those who would presume to lay hands upon it in order to turn it into collecti ve property . It is high time that there was an end of this misun derstanding, and there is only one way of achieving that: by jettisoning the word collectivism and declaring openly that we are comm unists, poin ting up the difference exist­ ing between our conception of anar chist communism and the one peddled by the mystical and authoritarian schools of communism prior to 1848. That would be a better expression of our ideal, and our propaganda could not but be strengthened by it. It will benefit from the fillip afforded by the idea of comm unism, a boost that the idea of collectivism will never afford. Comrade Elisee Reclus2 supports comrade Kropotkin 's remar ks. In spite of all the expl anations offered by the non-communist collec tivists, he finds it impos sible to comprehend how their organ ization of society would work . If the large plant, which is to say the land, and if all the secon dary fa ctories upon it are taken into common owner ship, if work is performed by everyone , and the quan tity and quality of products are due precise ly to concerted endeavor, to whom might these legiti mately belong, other than to the united body of workers? What rule is to serve as a guide fo r the distributive bookkeepers and help them determine the portion of the manna generated by the toil of mankind as a whole, preceding generations include d, which is due to each person? Such dist ribution , effected at random or whimsicall y, cannot have PETE R KRO POTKIN 283"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"any outcome other than the sowing of the seed of disagreemen ts, strite and death in the collecti vist society. What is true and what is just is that prod ucts owed to the labor of all should be the prop erty of all, and each person should be fr ee to avail of his portion in order to consume it as he sees fit, with no regulati on other than that emanat­ ing from the solid arity of interests and the mutual respect between associates. Moreo ver, it would be absurd to fe ar shortage, since the enormous loss of products caused by the current wastage of trade and private appro priation would have ceased at last. Fear is always a bad counse lor. Let us have no fe ar about describing ourselves as comm unists, as in tact we ar e. Popular opinion has a logic to it: the collectivists have done well and universal common sense has grasp ed that appropriation of the land and of fa ctories necessaril y leads on to common ownership of prod ucts. Comr ade Reclus would also like to see congress express reservations re­ garding the paragr aph in the Courtelary memorandum which relates to the Comm une. No doubt local conditions are a very significant fa ctor, and most of the groups will be established within the confin es of existing comm unes: but it should be borne in mind that combination of revolu tionary fo rces pro­ ceeds freely, outside of any communal organization. Up to now, communes have been only tiny States, and even the Paris Commune, insurrectio nary below, was governmental at the top and retained the whole hierarchy of of­ ficials and employees. We are no more communalists than we are Statists: we are anarchists, remember, and we offe r the best proof of that in our gathering today. We truly do hope to have a hand, however slight, in the revol utionary endea vor, and, whether we hail fr om Le Vallon, Geneva , Lausanne, France or Naple s, w . e fe el no attachm ent to any particular commune, nor to an y State. The International does not recognize these borders. Comrade Schwitzguebel declares himse lf an anarchist comm unist: ifhe accepts the program as just presented, which is to say, with collectivist ideas predominating, this is because he sees the populace as being rather more hostile than favorable to these ideas and because the drafting of a candidl y communist program could only exacerbate that hostility; he remarks that there is a matter of appropri ateness, so to speak, which needs to be investi­ gated carefully. Thus fa r, the communist idea has been poor ly understood among the populace where it is still belie ved to be a system devoid of all libert y. By his reckoning, there is a great preparatory work to be done to induce the populace to embr ace comm unism. 284 PETER KROPO TKIN"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Comrade Herzig, delegate fr om Geneva, finds that the program just outlined ascribes too man y powers to the Comm une and appears to want to replace the authority of the State, to which we stand opposed, by a new fo rmula, that of the Commu ne- which would amount only to the decentral­ ization of authority . Whereas it is true, as the program states, that the coming popular revol utions have their seat in the Commune and ha ve the autonomy of the latter as their objective, we should not, fo r that reason , look to this new conception of Revolution fo r our way ahead, nor seek to get the upper hand in events: our duty is to see that new ideas utter ly contrary to any prin ciple of authority blossom in men's minds.

We contest this view even when it might be proven that such strug gles would help bring down the State , fo r, in order to launch them, we should necessaril y have to walk the path oflegali ty, which would be contrary to our principles and would imply their abandonment. Comrade Cafiero, speaking of the revol utiona ry progra m, ventured to speak about communism ( ... ) 3 Comrade Pindy observes that not only can the idea of communism earn acceptance by the French worker, but communist sen6ment is innate in him: ifhe styles himself at the moment a collecti vist, this is on accoun t of ridicu­ lous stories that have been told ever since 1848 about the communism of that vintage .

It opens with the words \"For us manual workers ... \" This was the decorative engral'cr Adhemar Schwitzguebel, writ­ ing on behalf oI his comrades, These were workers who knew what they wanted. They bluntly spell out their views to the authoritarian socialists who flattered themselves that they would be taking power \"in order to turn the present State into a (ommuni st State.\" And did not heat about the hush when they answer ed them thus: 'TVL' cannot share this outlook.\" And they expressly condemn the obstacle to progress represented, as they saw it, by the State, in a vivid phrase, illspired by the countryside in which they lived and labor ed: \"H uman society strides out, hut the State is alri'ays a crock.\" Yet these libertarians, supporters of the masses' spontaneity, had no worries abollt the activist minorities whom they rega rded as indispensabl e in the steering of the social 286 PETE R KROPO TKIN"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"revolution: \"Intervention (. . . ) oj the party possessed (?f a theor etical understan ding oj this revolution is a no less significa nt Ja ctor. \" But, at the same time , the dangers if the successf ul revoluti on's being captur ed by leader s thrown up Jr om within its own rank s did not escape them . They labored the necessity of actin g in such a way that it \"does not revert to op erating to the adl'an tage oj the gover ning classes. \" As good disciples oj Bakunin and Ja mes Guillaume , but still ahead oj their time s, in that the anar chists oj 18 80 had not yet become syndicalists, they advocated a Je dera­ tion if trades bodies and sought a synthesi s betwcetl commune and syndicate.

But, worker s as they were, their penc hant was rather towa rds the latter soluti on: it would be the local Je dera­ tion oj trades bodies that would Jo und the commune of the Ju ture. Thus, probl ems which, in hard and Ja st Jo rm, confronted the Sp anish libertarian communi sts, during the 19 36 rel'olution, (See Volume III) had already been broached as long ago as 18 80 by the manual worker s oJ the Courtelary distric t.

Una ble to con ceive of any fo rm of politics other than the all-p owe rful, centralized State gov erned by an elective power, author itarian soci alism hopes to carry out the revolution in the system of ownership by taking over power in the State in order to turn the present State into a comm unist State.

The statist socialist party, in order to operate politically on lawful ter­ rain, had, unfortun ately, but one option: to pocket its communist program\" and espouse a short-term practical program, on which basis it hoped to rally the masses: from the programs put fo rward by the democratic bourgeoisie, it borrows the salient points, affording them a socialist hue and thus have arisen the differing short-term policy programs of the lawful socialist party.

This statist political tactic thus does not strike us as the correct one. Let us take a look at the abstentionist approach. The anarch ists, in broaden ing the social question and introducing into it, besides changes in ownership, the destruction of the State, were logic ally consistent in saying: since we seek destruction of the State, then, far from seeking to capture it in order to modify and transf orm it, we should instead be trying to create a vacuum around it, in order to undermine it with all the moral and material fo rces capable of mak­ ing their contribution to this effort. Such are the origins of the contemporary abstentionist current. Unfortunate ly, common sense and theoretical logic rarely square with real ity. While it is absolutely true, theoretic ally, that on the day the popular masses would refuse to appoint legislators, governm ents and State adminis trators , rejecting constitutions and laws and decli ning to pay taxes or perform military servic e, the State would have had its day in History, it is also 110 less true, on the other hand, that, in terms of practical ity, most human beings are attached to something or other in the present society and in the State .

The old Jacobin revolutionary tradition has had its day, and, since the Paris Comm une, a new revolutionary tradition has been building up around the idea of communal autonom y and fe derati on. More and more, opinion is leaning towards this new political fo rmat, as the excesses of centralization are fe lt to be mor e of a bur den by the populace everywhere; the development of the material situ­ ation as well as new currents of opinion lead on to the Commune and the fe deration of comm unes. Add to these general consi derations the necessary conseq uences of our party's preparatory efforts, and we can assert that the people's insu rrection will be hatched in the Comm une. Thus we ought to turn our attention to short -term revolu tionary measures in the Comm une.

Certain religious comm unities are living proof of that, since the most com plete equality obtai ns there , alongside despotism. Complete equal ity, in that the leader wears the same garb and eats at the same table as the others: only his right to command, sets him apart fr om them. And the supporters of the \"people's Stat e\"? If they were not to run up against all sorts of obsta cles, I am sure that they would event uall y achieve perf ect equal ity, but at the same time, also the most perf ect despotism, fo r, let us not fo rget, the despotism of the present State would be magnified by the economi c despotism of all of the capital which would have passed into State hands, and the whole thing would be multi plied by all of the centralization necessary to this new State.

Thus, contrary to what has been said, we are perf ectly right to fe ar fo r liberty, even should equality exist: whereas there can not be any fe ar fo r equal­ ity where true libe rty, whi ch is to say, anar chy, exists.

The people, mankin d, not being indivi duall y capable of seizing the wealth and holding it in their two hands, some have sought to conclude from that, it is true, that fo r that reason we have to raise up an entire class of leaders, represent atives and depo sitories of the common wealth.

No: as we have said and will never cease repeating: no go-betweens, no courtiers and no obliging servitors who always wind up as the real masters: we want all existing wealth to be taken over directly by the people itself , want it to be held in its powerf ul hands, and want the peo ple to decide fo r itself the best way of putting it to use, either fo r produ ction or consumption. Ye s, comm unism is feas ible. Each person can very well be left to avail at will of what he needs, since there will be enough fo r everyo ne. There will no longer be any need to require more labor than the individual is willing to give , because there will still be a sufficiency of prod ucts fo r the next day. And it is thanks to this abundan ce that labor will lose the ignoble character of slavishne ss, leaving it sole ly the charms of a moral and physical need, like the need to study and live alongside nature. This is not at all to argue that comm unism is possible: we can affirm its necess ity. Not onl y can one be a comm unist, but one has to be one, on pain of falling short of the goal of revol ution. Indeed, once the instru ments oflabor and raw materials have been taken into common ownersh ip, if we were to cling to private appropriation of the produc ts ofla bor, we should find ours elve s obliged to retain mone y, the root of more or less siza ble accumulation of wealth, accordi ng to the greater or lesser merits, or rather, greater or lesser shrewdness of the indivi dual. In which case equality would have vanished, since anyone who contrived possession of more wealth would alread y, by virtue of that very fact, ha ve raised himself above the level of the others . It would require just one more step to be taken for counter -revol utionaries to intr oduce rights of inheritan ce.

For those of us who are inti mat ely acqu ainted with where the accumulation of wealth and its transmission through inheritan ce has taken socie ty, there is no room fo r doubt on this score. But indi vidual claim upon products would not only restore the inequal­ ity betw een men: it would also restore inequal ity between the various types PE TER KR OPOTK IN 295"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"of work.

This would lead to a renaissance of idleness and diligence, merit and demer it. good and evil, vice and virtue, and conseq uently, of \"reward \" on the one hand, and of \"punishment\" on the other, along with law, judge, under ling and prison. There are socia lists who persist in arguing the notion of individual owner­ ship of the products oflabor, on the basis of a sense of fa irness. Curious delusion! With collecti ve labor, which fo ists upon us the neces­ sity of large-scale production and widespread mechani zation, with modern industry 's ever-inc reasing tendency to avail of the labor of preceding genera­ tions, how could we determine which morsel is the product of one man's labor and which the product of another 's? It is utter ly impos sible and our advers aries acknowledge this so readil y them selves that they wind up saying;- \"Well then' Let us take time worked as the basis for distributio n.\" But at the same time they themse lves confess that this would be unfair, since three hours of Peter 's work can often be worth five hours of Paul's. T h ere was a tinle when we used to describe ourselves as \"collectivists,\" i n that that was the word distinguis hing us from the individ ualists and authori­ tarian comm unists , but, basicall y, we were quite simply anti-auth oritarian comm unists, and by calling ourse lves \"collectivists,\" we sought to use that name to express our idea that everything should be held in common, with no differe ntiation being made between the instru ments and materials oflabor and the products of collecti ve labor . But one fine day we witnessed the emergence of yet another stripe of so­ cialists who, reviving the errant ways of the past, began to philo sophize, and draw distinctions and make differentiations on this score, and finall y ended up as apostles of the fo llowing thesis: \"There are\"-they say-\"u se values and product ion values.

So, as we can see, it was not that theory that could have given fresh strength to advoc ates of indi vidual ownership of the products of labor. This theory achieved only one thing: it gave away the game of these fe w socialists who soug ht to blunt the thrust of the revolut ionary idea; it has opened our eyes and shown us the necessity of decl aring ourselves quite bluntl y comm unists. But finally let us tackle the one and only serious objection that our adversar­ ies have put fo rward against comm unism. They all agree that we are inevita bly moving towards comm unism, but they note that we are just at the beginning of this and, products being in insuf ficient supply, ratio ning and sharing will have to be introd uced, and the best way to share out the prod ucts oflabor would be one based upon the amount oflabor performed by each individual.

Let us take a look at the main ones. What was the essential object of this \"conspiracy\" or \"conf ederacy\" into which the bour geois of a given city entered in the twelf th centu ry? The object was to break fr ee of the seigneur. The inhabitan ts, merch ants and artisans , came together and pledged not to allo w \"anyone at all to do wrong to one of them and treat him thereaf ter as a serf \": it was against its fo rmer masters that the Commune rose up in arms. \"Co mmune\" -says one twelf th century writer quoted by Augustin Thierr y-\" is a new and despicable word, and this is what is meant by the term : persons liable to tallage now deliver on ly once a year to their seigneur the rent which they owe him. If they commit any crime , they can be quit of it through payment of a legall y prescribed fine : and , as fo r the levies in money cust omaril y inflicted upon serfs, they are wholl y exempt fr om those.\" So it was very much against the seigneur that the medieval Com mune revo lted. It is fr om the State that toda y's Commune will seek libera tion.

It knows that there can be no half way house: eith er the Commun e is to be absolut ely free to endow itself with what ever institutions it wishes and intr oduce all reforms and revolu tions it may deem nece ssary, or else it will remain what it has been to dat e, a mere subsidiary of the State, chain ed in its every movem ent, fo rever on the brink of conflict with the Stat e and certain of succ umbing in any ensuing struggle. It knows that it must smash the State and replace it with the Federat ion, and it will act according ly. Mor e than that, it will have the wherewithal so to do. Today, it is no long er just small towns which are hoisting the flag of comm unal insurr ection. It is Paris, Lyo n, Marseill es, Carta gena, and soon every great city will unfurl the sam e flag. And that, if ever there was one, is an essential difference . In liberat ing itself from its Seigneur, was the medieval Commun e also breaking free of the wealth y bour geois who , through sale of merchandis e and capital, had amassed personal fo rtun es inside the city? Not at all! Once it had torn down the tow ers of its seign eur, the town dweller soon watch ed the rise with in the Comlnun e itself of the citad els of rich merc hants determin ed to bring him to heel, and the dom estic hist ory of the medieval Communes is the hist ory of a bitter stru ggle betw een rich and poor, a stru ggle which, inevita bly, ended with intervention by the king . With aristocracy expand­ ing more and more within the very bosom of the Commun e, the populac e, now fallen, with regard to the wealthy seign eur from the upper city, into a servitud e which had previou sly been his status with regard to the lord outside, realized that the Comm une was no long er worth defending: it deserted the ram parts which he had erected in order to win his freedom and which, as a result of individ ualist rule, had become the boul evards of a new serfdom. With nothing to lose, it left the rich merchants to look to their own defenses, and the latter were defeated; unsexed by luxury and vice, enjoying no su pport fr om the peopl e, they were soon com pelle d to yield to the injuncti ons of the king 's heralds and handed over the keys to their cities.

Will its first thought not be to smash the power of capital and banish fo rever any chance that aristoc racy , which brought about the down fall of the medieval Communes, might raise its head? Will it mist ake bishop and monk fo r allies? Finally, is it going to imitate ancestors who looked to the Commune for nothing more than the creation of a State within the State? Who, abolishing the power of the seigneur or king, could think of nothing better to do than recons titute the very same power, down to the finest detail, forgetting that that power, though conf ined within the town wal ls, never thele ss retained all of the vices of its paragon? Are the proletarians of our century about to imitate those Floren tines who, while abol ishing titles of nobility or forcing them to be worn as a badge of disgr ace, simultaneous ly allowed a new aristocr acy, an aristocr acy of the fa t purse, to be created?

Once it had shaken off the yoke of its seigneur, did the medieval commune seek to hit him in the source of his power? Did it try to rally to the assistance of the agricul tural popu lation which surrounded it and, equi pped with weap­ onry which rural serf s did not have, place these weap ons in the service of the wr etches u p on whom it looked proudly down fr om atop its walls?

Proud of its liberties , it did not think to extend them to those groaning outside. It was at this price, at the price of preserving its neighbors' serfdom, that many a commune earned its independenc e. Then again, was it not also in the interests of the great bour geois of the commune to see the serfs from the plains stay boun d to the land, ignorant of industry and commerce, and still obliged to look to the town fo r their suppl ies of iron, metals and industrial products? And whenever the artisan thought to stretch his hand beyond the walls separating him from the serfs, what could he avail against the wishes of the bour geois who had the upper hand, a monop oly upon the arts of war and hardened mercenaries in his hire? Now what a differenc e: would the victorious Paris Commune have made do with endowing itself with more or less free municipal institutions? The Parisian prole tariat smashing its chains would have signaled social revol ution, first in Paris and then in the rural comm unes. The Paris Commune, even as it was fighting desper ately fo r its survi val, neverth eless told the peasant: Seize the land, all of it! It would not have confined itself to words, and, if need be, its valiant sons would have carried their weapons to fa r-flung villages to as­ sist the peasant with his revoluti on: to drive out the land-thiev es, and seize it in order to place it at the disposal of all who wish and have the expertise to harvest its bounty. The medieval Commune sought to retreat inside its \\valls: the nineteenth- century one seeks to range fa r and wide, to become universal. I t h as replaced communal privilege with human solidar ity. The medie val commune could ensconce itself within its walls and, to some extent, cut itself off from its neighbors. Whenever it entered into deal­ ings with other comm unes, those dealings were most often confined to a treaty in defense of city rights against the seigneur, or a solidari ty agreement fo r the mutual protection of comm une citizens on long journeys. And when authentic leagues were fo rmed between towns, as in Lomba rdy, Spain and Belgium, these leagues being far from homog eneous, and too fragile because of the diversity of privilege s, promp tly fragmented into isolated groups or succum bed under the onsla ught of neighboring States.

Isolation need not be feared: if communists in the United States have a grieva nce in their communi ty, it docs not relate to isolati on, but rather to the intru sion of the surroun ding bourgeois world into their communal affairs. The fa ct that today commerce and trade, oYerruling the limitations of borders, have also torn dowll the walls of the ancient cities.

The devel opment of the big industrial hubs has done more. Even in our own day, the parochial mentality could arouse a lot offrictions between two adjacent commu nes, prevent their allying with one another and even ignite fratrici dal strife. But whereas such frictions may indeed preclu de direct federation of these two communes, that federation will procee d through the good offices of the larger centers . Today, two tiny adjoining municipal ities often have nothing to bring them really close: what fe w dealings they have woul d be more likely to generate friction than establish ties of solidarit y.

And yet this hub coul d not itself acquir e an irksome ascen dancy over the surrounding commun es. Thanks to the infini te variety of the needs of industry and commer ce, all population centers already have several centers to which they are bound, and as their needs devel op, they will fo rm at­ tachments to other centers Clpable of meeting these new needs. So various are our needs and so rapidly do they sprout that, soon, one federation will no longer suffice to meet them all. So, the Commune will sense a need to contract other alliances and enter into another fe deratio n. Member of one group fo r the purposes of securing its fo od requiremen ts, the Commune will have to belong to a secon d one in order to obtain other items it needs, say, meta ls, and then a third and fourth group for its cloth and craft goods . Pick up an economic atlas of any coun try at all, and you will see that economic frontiers do not exist : the areas where various products are produce d and exchang ed mutually overl ap, interlinking and criss-cr ossing. Similar ly, the federat ions of comm unes, if they continue to expan d freely, would soon interwea ve, criss-cross and overl ap, thereby fo rming a compact \"one and indivisible\" netw ork quite different from these statist combinations which are merely juxtaposed, just as the rods of the fasces are group ed aroun d the lie tor's axe. Thus , let us repeat, those who come along and tell us that the Co mmu nes, once rid of State oversight, are going to clash and destroy one another in internecine warfare , overlook one thing: the intimate bonds already existing between various localities, thanks to the industrial and commercial hubs, thanks to the numbers of such hubs, thanks to unbroken dealings . They fail to appreciate what the middle ages were, with their closed cities and caravans lumbering slowly along difficult roads overlooked by robber-barons; they overlook the flows of men, goods , mail, telegr ams, ideas and affections hurtling between our cities like the waters of rivers which never run dry; they have no clear pictur e of the difference between the two eras they seek to compare one with the other.

As fa r as we anarchists are concerned, dicta torship of a single individual or party -wh ich boils down to the same thing -stands fo rever condemne d. We know that a social revolu tion is not steered by the mind of just one man or one group . That revolu tion and gove rnment are incompatib le, we know: the one must do the other to death , and the name under which gove rnment may go-dic tatorship, monar chy or parliamen t-is oflittle account.

Those who peddle dict atorshi p gener­ ally fa il to real ize that, by sustaining that prejudice, they are merely preparing the ground fo r those who will later cut their throats . There is, though, one phrase by Rob espierre which his admi rers would do well to remember.

But those words were spoken in 1792! By which time France had been three years already in revolution! In fa ct, the monarchy was no more : it only remained to deliver the cou p de grace; in fact, the fe udal system had been swept away. And yet, even at that point, when the revolution was surging freely ahead, there was this counter -revo lutionary, I3rissot, standing every chance of being acclaimed dictator! And earlier, in 1789? It was Mirabeau who might have been hoisted into power. The man who offered his eloqu ence to the king fo r hire, this was the man who might have been hoisted into power at that point, had the risen people not imposed its sovereignty at pike-point, and had they not fo rged ahead through the fa it s accomplis of the Jacquer ie, exposing the insubstantiality of any constituted autho rity in Paris or in the departmen ts. But the governmental prejudice so blinkers those who talk about dictat or­ ship that they prefer to pave the way fo r the dictatorship of some new Brissot or Napoleon, rather than turn away from the idea of awarding a new master to men breaking free of their chains! The secret societies from the time of the Restoration and Louis- Philippe have made a mighty contribut ion to the survival of the prejudice of dictat or­ ship. Backed by the workers, the bourgeois republ icans of the time mounted a long succes sion of conspiracies aiming at the overthrow of monarchy and procl amati on of the Republ ic. Not cognizant of the profound changes which were needed in France , even if a bourgeois republ ican regime was to be estab­ lished, they deluded them selves that through a tar-reaching conspiracy they could some day topple the monarchy, seize power and proclaim the Repub lic. Over a period of almost thirty years , these secret societies toiled unceasing ly, with unbounded commitment and heroic perse verance and coura ge. If the Republic emerged quite naturall y from the February 1848 insurrecti on, this was thanks to these socie ties, thanks to the propaganda by deed which they had mounted over those thirty years . But fo r their noble efforts, the Republ ic would even now be imposs ible. Thus, their goal was to seize power themse lves and set thems elves up as a repub lican dicta torshi p.

But the final push, the one that brought down the bourgeoi sie's king once and fo r all, was a lot broader and a lot stronger than any secret society might mount: it emanated from the mass of the people. The outcome, we know. The party which had paved the way for the downtall of monarchy found itself excluded from events in City Hall. Others, too cautious to tread the paths of conspiracy, but likewise better known and more moderate, bided their time until they could seize power and occupy the position which the plotters intended to capture to the sound of cannon. The journalists, lawyers and good orators who worked on their good reputat ions while the real republicans were forging themselves weapons or perishing in dungeons, captured power. Some, being famous already, were acclaimed by the rubbernecks : others pushed thems elves fo rward and were acceptable because their names stood for nothing, other than a program of accommodation to everyone. Let no one tell us that the party of action is lacking in practical acumen: and that others can outdo them. No, a thousand times, no! As much as the movements of the heavens, it is a law that the party of action is excluded while schemers and prattlers take power. The latter are more fa miliar to the broad masses which mount the final push. They poll more votes, fo r, with or without news-sheets, and whether by acclamat ion or through the ballot box, there is, essentiall y, always a sort of unspo ken choic e made at that point by acclam ation . They are acclai med by all and sundry, especi ally by the revolution's enemies who prefer to push nonentities to the fo re, and acclama­ tion thus ackn owledges as leaders persons who, deep down, are inimical to the movement or indif ferent to it.

Allowing some government to establish itself, some strong po wer which com­ mands obedience, is tantamount to stunting the progress of the revolution fr om the outset. The good which gov ernment might do is negli gible and the harm immeasur able. Indeed, what is it about and what do we take Revo lution to mean?

Anv external authority cannot be anything other than an impediment, an obstacle to this organizational undertaking which has to be carried out, and, from the outset, a source of discord and hatred. But it is high time that the oft-rebutted illusion of revolutionary govern­ ment, which has so often cost us so dear, was jettisoned. It is time to tell our­ selves once and for all and take to heart the political adage that a government cannot be revolutionary. The Convention is in voked: but let us not forget that the few mildly revolutionary measures taken by the Convention placed the seal upon acts carried out by the people which was at that point marching ahead, ignoring all government. As Victor Hugo said in his vivid style, Danton pushed Robespierre, Marat monitored and pushed Danton, and Mar at himself was pushed by Cimour dain,5 that embodiment of the clubs of the \"enrages\" and rebels. Like every government before and after it, the Convention was merely a ball and chain about the people's ankles. The lessons of history here are so conclusive: the impossibility of revolu­ tionary government and the poisonous ness of what goes under that name are so self-evident that it would be hard to account for the passion with which a certain self-styled socialist school clings to the idea of government. But there is a very straightforward explanation. Socialists though they profess to be, exponents of this school have a view that differs very greatly from our own of the revolution we are called upon to carry out. For them as for all bourgeois radicals, the social revolution is rather a distant prospect not to be contemplated today. Though they dare not say it, what they have in mind, in their heart of hearts, is something quite different. What they have in mind is the installation of a government similar to the one in Switzerland or in the United States, with a few attempts to take into State care what they ingeniou sly describe as \"public services.\" This is something akin to Bismarck's ideal or the ideal of the tailor who has been elected to the presidency of the United States. It is a ready-made compromise between the socialist aspirations of the masses and the appetites of the bourgeois. They would like co mprehensive expropriation , but have not the courage to attempt it and put it off until next century, and, even before battle is joined, they are locked in negotiations with the enemy.

Even now the latter is trying to get itself organized so as to restore the old order, capitalizing upon the widespread exhaustion caused, first, by the war, and then by the bmine we in central Russia are suffering and by the utter chaos existing in exchange and production -thi ngs inevitable during such a comprehensive revolu tion, carried out by decree. In the West, there is talk of re-establishing \"order\" in Russia by means of armed intervention by the allies. Well, dear friend, you know what a crime against the whole social progress of Europ e, in my view, was the attitu de of those who toiled to break down Russi a's power of resistance , which prolonged the war by a year, brought us German invasion under cover of a treaty, and cost rivers of blood in order to prevent all-conquering German y from trampling Europe beneath its imperial boot. My fe elin g s on this score, you are fa miliar '.vith 3 And yet I protest as strenuou sly as I can against armed allied intervention of any sort in Russian affairs. Such intervention woul d result in an upsur ge of Russian jingoi sm.

The Americans have already grasped this. Perhaps the belief is that by backing Admiral Koltchak and General Denikin;' one is supporting a liberal, republ ican party. But even that is a mistake. Whatever the personal intentions of these two military leaders may be, the vast majority of those who have rallie d to them have different aims. Inevita bly, what they \\voul d bring us would be a return to monarchy, reaction and a bloodbath. Those of the allies who have a clear vision of events ought theref ore to turn away from any armed interven tion. Especi ally if they genuinely do wish to come to the assistance of Russia, they will find plenty of opportuni ty elsewhere .

MO SCOW GUBE RN IY A, APRI L 28. 1919 I have been asked whether I do not have a messa ge for the workers of the western world. Assured ly, there is a lot to say and learn about the current events in Russia. As the message might be unduly long, let me just set out a few main points . First of all, the workers of the civilized world and their friends in other classes ought to lobby their gover nments to abandon completely the notion of armed intervention in Russia 's affairs, whether this be mounted overtly or in an underhand, military way or in the fo rm of sub sidies to different nations. At this moment, Russia is undergoing a revol ution as profound and impor­ tant as those made by England in 1639-164R J11d France in 1789-1794. Each nation ought to refuse the shame fu l role to which England, Prussia , A ustria and Russia were reduced during the French revolu tion. Furthermore, it should be remembered that the Russian revolution which is aiming to build a society in which the entire output of the combined efforts oflabor, techn ical expertise and scientific know ledge woul d go wholl y to the community itself , is not a mere accident of party political strugg le. It has been incubated over almost a centur y of comm unist and socialist propaganda , ever since the days of Robert Owen, Saint-Simon and Fourier.1 And although the attempt to usher in the new society by means of a one-party dicta torship may seem condemned to failure, it has to be ackno wledged that the revolut ion has already introduced into our everyday life fresh ideas regar ding the rights of labor, its true status in society and the duties of every citizen, and that these will endure. Not just workers but all progres sive elements in the civilized nations ought to cut off the support that they have hitherto given adversaries of the revolutio n. Not that there is nothing objectiona ble in the methods of the Bolshevik gover nment. Far from it! But any armed intervention by a fo reign power necessa rily leads to a bolstering of the dictatorial tendencies of those PETER KROPOTK IN 329"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"in government and stymies the efforts of those Russians ready to help Russi a, regardless of their government, in the restoration of its life. The evils inherent in party dic tatorship have thus been magnified by the war-time circumstances amid which that party exists . The state of war has provided the pretext for reinforcing the dictatorial metho ds of the party as well as its tendency to centralise every detail oflife within government hands, the upshot of which is to halt the enormous ramifications of the nation's normal activiti es. The native evils of State communism have been multiplie d ten-f old, on the pretext that all of the miseries of our lives are ascribable to interv ention by fo reigne rs. I ought to point out, too, that if the Allies' military in tervention persists , it will assuredl y spawn in Russia a fe eling of resentment towar ds the western nations , a sentim ent of which use will some day be made in future conflicts . Even now that resen tment is growing. In short, it is high time that the nations of western Europe entered into direct relations with the Russian nation. And in this regard, you, the working class and most advance d elements in every nation, ought to have your say. One more word on the overa ll situation. The restoration of relations between the European nations, America and Russia in no way signifies the Russian nation 's suprem acy over the nationalities making up the empire of the tsars. I mperial Rus,ia is dead and will not return from the grave . The future of its different provinces lies in the direction of a great fe deration . The natural territories of the various parts of this fe deration are quite distinct, as any of us conversant with Russia 's history , ethnography and economic life are aware . All efforts to unite under a central comman d the comtitu­ ent parts of the Russian Empir e-Fi nland, the Baltic provinces, Lithuania, the Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Siberia, etc.-are assuredly doomed to fa il. So it would be useful, were the western nations to declar e that they recognise the right to indepen dence of each and every part of the fo rmer Russian Empire. My view is that this trend will continue. I see coming soon a time when each part of this fe deration will itself be a fe deration of rural communes and free cities. And I believe, fu rther, that certain parts of western Europe will soon follow the exam ple of this movement . As fa r as our prese nt economic and political position is concer ned, the Russian revolu tion, being the conti nuation of the two great revolu tions in Engla nd and France, is trying to venture beyon d the point where France 330 PETER KROPOTKIN"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"stopp ed, when she managed to establish what was called de fa cto equality, which is to say, economic equal ity. Regretta bly, in Russia, this attempt has been mounted under the strong ly centralized dicta torship of one party, the maximalist Social Democra ts. An experim ent along the same lines was conducted by Babeuf's extremely cen­ tralistic Jacobin conspir acy. I have to tell you candidly that, in my view, this attempt to erect a comm unist republic upon a base of strong ly centr alized State comm unism, under the iron law of a one-party dicta torship is heading for fiasco. We in Russia are beginning to learn how communism shoul d not be introduc ed, even by a populace weary of the old regime and offering no active resistance to the experiment being conducted by the new governors. The idea of Soviets , that is, of workers' and peasants' councils , fm t advocated prior to the attem pted revolut ion of 1905 and prom ptly realized by the Feb­ ruary 1917 revoluti on, once tsarism had been overth rown, the idea of such councils controlling the coun try's political and economic life, is a grand idea. Especially as it necess arily leads to the idea that these councils ought to be made up of all who, through their own personal effort, play a real part in the production of the nation's wealth. But as long as a country is governed by a one-par ty dictatorship, the work­ ers' and peasants' councils obviou sly lose all significance. They are reduced to the passive role fo rmer ly played by the estates general and parliaments when these were summoned by the king and pitted against an all-powerful royal council. A labor council ceases to be a free and substantial council when there is no press freedom in the land, and we have been in those circumstances fo r the past two years , supposedly because a state of war obtain s. What is more, workers' and peasants' councils lose all significance when elections are not preceded by free electioneering, and when elections are conducted under the pressur e from a party dicta torship. Of course, the usual excuse is that dictato­ rial legislation is inevitable as a means of combatting the old regim e. But such law obviou sly becomes a retrograde step once the revol ution buckles down to the construction of a new society upon a new economic founda tion. It turns into a sentence of death upon the new construction. The ways of overthr owing an ailing government are well known to history, ancient and modern.

This is what we are learning in Russia today. And this is what you western workers can and shoul d avoid by all means if you have the success of social reconstruction at heart. Send your delegates over here to see how a social revolution operates in real lifc. The tremen dous construc tive endeavor which a social revolution requires cannot be performed by a central gover nment, even if it is guided by some­ thing more substantial than a few socialist and anarchist hand-b ooks. It takes expertise, brains and the willing cooperation of a host of local specialize d elements, who, alone, can successf ully address the range of economic issues as they affect the local ity. Rejecting such cooperation and falling back upon the genius of the party's dictators is tantamount to destro ying the indepen dent agent such as the trade unions (known in Russia as professional unions) and local cooperati ve organizations, by turning them into bureaucratic adjuncts of the party, as is currentl y the casco But that is the way not to make the revol ution, the way to render its maki ng imp ossib le. And the reason why I fe el it my duty to place you on your guard against borrow ing such directives . The imperialist conq uerors of every national ity may want the populations of the one-tim e Russian empire to remain fo r as long as possible in miserable economic conditions and thus condemned to fu rnishing western and centr al Europe with raw materials, while the western industrialists will pocket all of the profits that Russians might have been able to reap from their labors. But the work ing classes of Europe and America, as well as the intelligentsia of these countries, assuredly understand that violence alone could trap Russia in such subjection. At the same time, the sympathies which our revol ution evoke d everywhere in Russia and in America show that you were happy to salute Russia as a new memb er of the international confraternity of nations. And you will assuredly soon notice that it is in the interests of all the workers of the world that Russia shoul d be freed as soon as possible from the condi­ tions prese ntly arresting her development.

In order to bring this about, the working classes of every nation must be closely united and the notion of a great international of all the world's workers must be revive d, not in the shape of a unity under the baton of a single party, as was the case with the Second International, and is again the case with the Third International. Such unions of course have every reason to exist, but outside of them, and uniting them all, there ought to be a union of all the world 's trade unions, federated so as to deliver worldw ide production from its present subje ction to capital.

In spite of his years, his thinking has retained all of its lucidity. His steps are as sprightly as ours. His memory inexhaustib le. He speaks to us of the days of the Commune and rehearses tiny detail s, as ifit had all happ ened just yester day. He also relates tales of his youth, when he explo red Siberia and the borders with China, with the same liveliness as a yo ung schoolbo y.

More than ever, Kropotkin is confi rmed in his opinion s: with their metho ds, the com­ munists, instead of setting people on the road to communism, will finish up making its very name hatef ul to them. Sincere they may well be: but their system preve nts them in practice from introducing the slightest princi ple of comm unism. And, noting that no progress is being made in the work of the revol ution, he fo resees from this \"that the people is not ready to endorse their decrees, that it will take time and changes of course .\" This is reasonable: the tale of political revolu tions told all over again. The saddest thing is that they do not recogn ize and refuse to ackno wledge their mistakes, and each passing day wrests a morsel of the conq uests of the Revolution away from the masses, to be gobbled up by the centralist State. III any event, he says, the experience of the Revo lution is not waste d on the Russian people. It has awakened; it is on the move towar ds better pros­ pects. Four years of revolution do more to raise a people's consciousness than a century spent vegetating. -W hat is your view of the fu ture of the Revolu tion, and, as you see it, what force might profita bly replace the Bolsheviks? -We shoul d not place undue emphasis upon the masses' refusing indefi­ nitely to back the Bolsheviks.

In an y such uphea val, the basic fa ctor was the organization of the coun try's ec onomic lif e. The Russian Revo lution was proof that we ou ght to ha ve made preparations fo r that.

He was ref erring to anarcho-syndic alism, hinting that such an arrangement, with heIp fr om coop erati ves, would rescue futur e revol utions fr om the fa tal mis takes and ghastl y suf fering which Ru ssia was end uring.

It was fo ur o'clock in the morning by the time we arrived. Along with Alexa ndrer Schapiro, 3 a close fa mily fr iend of the Kropo tkins, and Lavrov, a comrade from the Bakers' Union, I rushed towards the Kropotkins' villa.

His devastated widow told me that Peter had asked repeate dly whether I was on my way and when I would be arriving. Sophie was on the verge of collapse and, thanks to the need to tend her, I fo rgot the cruel conspiracy of circumstances which had denied me the chance to render the slightest service to the man who had given such a powerf ul fillip to my life and work . Sophie informed us that Lenin, upon hearin g of Peter's illness, had des­ patched the flllest doctors from Mosco w to Dmitrov, as well as provisions and sweets fo r the patient . He had also ordered that he be kept briefed regular ly about Peter's condition and that these bulletins be carried by the ne\\vs papers. What a sad denouement, that so much attention had been lavished. as he lay upon his death bed, upon the man who had twice been raided by the Cheka and been forced to go into reluctant retirement fo r that very reason! Peter Kropotkin had helped prepare the ground fo r the Revolu tion, but had been denied a part in its life and development: his voice had rung out throughout Russia in spite of tsarist persecution, but it had taken a communist dictator­ ship to silence it. Peter never asked and never accepted any favors from any government , and would countenance no pomp and circumstance. So we decided that there should be no State interference in his fu neral, and that it should not be degraded by the attendance of officials .

His deepest regret in his declining hours was that he had not had just a little more time to complete what he had begun years earlier.

Sasha ar rived in Dmi trov with numerous Moscow comrades to he lp remove Peter's body to Mosco w. The little village had never paid anyone such grand tribute as it did to Peter Kropot kin.

From Sasha, I disco vered en route that the commission handling Peter Kropotkin 's fu neral arra ngemen ts, which he had hel ped run and of which he was the chairman, had al ready been the ob je ct of a lot of obstruction fr om the soviet authorit ies. The commission had been autho rized to publish two of Peter's pamphlets and bring out a special edition of the bulletin in commemo­ ration of Peter Krop otkin.

Sasha, Schapir o :1I1d other comrades ob je cted, saying that that would dela y publicat ion. To buy time, the y had promised that the bulletin would carry onl y commentaries upon Kropotkin's lif e and work . Then, all of a sudden, the censor rememb ered that he had too much wor k at the moment and that the bulletin would ha ve to wait its turn . Which meant that the bulletin could not app ear in time fo r the fu ner al, and it was obvious that the Bolsheviks were rel ying upon their usual dela y tactics to hold it up un til it was too late to se rve its purpose. Our comrades res olved up on direct action. Lenin had of ten hi ja cked that anarchist idea, so why should the anarchists not reclaim it fr om him? Time was pressing and the matter was important enough to risk arrest over. They broke the seals which the Chcka had placed upon our old comrade Atab ekian 's pri ntworks and our comrades worked like Tro jans to prepare and get the bulletin ready bef ore the fu neral.

But the Ve-Cheka was not, it seems, inclined to obey, either Lenin or the highest authoritv of its own part y. It asked if the commis sion could guarantee the prisoners' return to prison. The commission offered its collecti ve assur ances. Whereupon the Ve-cheka declared that \"there were no anarchists imprisoned in Mosco w.\" In point of fact, the Butyr ky and the Cheka 's own cells were crammed with comrades of ours rounded up during the raid on the Khar kov Conf erenc e, even though the latter, by virtue of an agreement between the soviet government and Nestor Makhno, had had official authori zation.

At the early age of fo urteen years , he sent an insolent threatening letter to King Victor Emm anuel II, as a result of which he was arrested. He received his education in Naples at the seminary of the Scalloped Friars, going on to read medicine at university . A one-tim e republican who later repudiated Mazzin i's patro nage, he joined the Inter­ national in 1871, a fe w months before the Paris Commune, falling in with its Bakuninis t wing. In October 1876, he played an active part in the Berne congress of the \"anti-a uthoritarian\" International, where , straying somewhat from Bakunin 's ideological legacy , he repudiated \"collectivism\" to become an exponent of \"libertarian communism \" (See Volume II) and also to broach the notion of \"propaganda by deed.\" From then on, Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero and Kropotkin were inseparable. In the province of Benevento in 1877, the first two named attempted to put their activism into effect, Blanqui st-fashion. At the head of around thirty Interna tionalists, armed and fo llowing red flags, they seized the villag e of Len­ tino, issued arms to the population and put the public records to the torch . But the popu lation remained passive onlookers and the army stepped in. Malatesta and Cafiero were arrested on the spot. Although they conceded that they had fired shots at the carabinieri, they were acquitted when brought to trial. After lots of adventures in the Middle East, Malatesta left Marseilles for Geneva, where he joined Kropotkin in publishin g the newsp aper Le Revolte. Expelled from Switzerland and then from a number of other countries, he finally settled in London, where he turned his hand to a number of minor trades. In 1881, the anarchists assembled in London fo r an international congr ess, and Mala testa sugge sted, to no avail, that an Anarchist International be formed (see below). Returning to Italy, he was able to resume his revol utionar y activity and founded two newspapers there , La Que stiane saciale and I.:A narchia, which were anti-patriotic and anti-par liamentarist in tone.

ON THE NE C ESS ITY OF OR GAN IZA TI ON2 Organization is only the practice of cooperation and solidari ty, the natural and necessary condition of social life, an inelucta ble fact forcing itself upon everyo ne, upon human society generall y as well as upon any group of people with a comm on aim to strive for. Man does not wish, nor has he the ability, to live in isolation. He cann ot even become truly a man and meet his material and moral requi rements other than in society and through cooper ation with his fellows. So it is inevitable that all who do not organize themselves freely, either because they cannot, or because they are not alive to the urgent necess ity of so doing, should ha ve to endure the organization established by other individuals ordinar ily constituted as a ruling class or group, for the purpose of exploiting other people's labor for their own benefit. And the age-old oppression of the masses by a tiny number of privileged has always been the consequence of most indi viduals' ina bility to come to some accommodation, to organize alongside other workers on the basis of shared interests and persuasio ns, fo r the purposes of production and enjoyment and self-defense against the exploiters and oppre ssors. Anarchism offers a remed y for this state of affairs, with its under lying princi ple of free organization, generated and sustained by the free will of the assoc iated with no authority of any sort, which is to say, without any individual 's having the right to foist his wishes upon anyone else. So it is only natural that anarchists should seek to apply to their private lives and party life, this very same princi ple upon which, they hold, the whole of human society should be fo unded.

Before a whole category of think ers ever deemed such organization pos­ sible and desir able, before it was ever adopted as a goal by a party which has since become one of the prime factors in modern social strug gles, the word Anar chy was generall y taken in the sense of disorder, confusion: to this very day, it is taken by the ignorant masses and by adversaries concerned to hide the truth to mean just that. As government was held to be necessar y, in t113t it was accepted that without government there could be naught but disorder and confusion, it is only natural, and indeed logical, that the term Anar chy, signif ying absence of government, should also signif y absence of order. The phenomenon is not without precedent in the history of words. In the days and in the countries where the people believed in the necessity of government by one person (monarch y), the term Republ ic, signif ying gov­ ernment by m;uori ty, was taken in the sense of disor der and confusion: the very same meaning still attaches to it in the popular parlance in virtuall y every country. Do but change minds and persuade the public that not only is government not a necessi ty, but that it is extremely dang erous and harmf ul, and the word Anarchy, precise ly because it signifies absence of government, would imply, as far as everyone is concerned: natural order, harmony of everyone's needs and interests, utter freedom in solidar ity. It is argued, incorrect ly, that the anarchists made a poor choice of name, since that name is miscons trued by the masses and susce ptible to misinterpre­ tation . The error resides, not in the word, but in the thing: and the difficulty encoun tered by anarchists in their propaganda springs, not from the name they espouse, but from the fact that their outlook sits ill with all of the age­ old prejudices which people cherish regar ding the fu nction of government Of, to use the common parlance, regarding the State.

The meta physi cal tendency (which is an afflic tion of the mind whereby man, having, by means oflogic , abstracted the qualities of an entity, succum bs to a sort of halluci nation whereby he mistakes the abstraction for the reality), the metaphysical tendency , shall we say, which, tor all of the buffeting of positive scien ce, is still de eply rooted in the minds of most contempor aries, ensures that many think of government as a moral entity , endowed with cer­ tain attributes of reason, justice and equity quite separ ate from the personn el of the government. For them, the govern ment, or rather, the State, is the abstract power of society: it is the represe ntative , albeit the abstract repre sentati ve, of the gen­ eral interest : it is the expression of the rights of all, construed as a limit upon the rights of each. This way of thinking about government is supported by interested parties preoccu pied \\vith salvaging the principle of authority and seeing it outlive the shortcomings and errors of those who succeed one another in the exerc ise of power. We see government as the collec tivity of those who govern: and gove rn­ ments , kings, preside nts, ministers, depu ties, etc., are those endowed with the fa culty of making laws in order to regulate the relations between men and of having those laws carried out; of prescribing and levying taxes; of enfor cing military service; of judging and punishing those who trespass again st t he laws, of supervising and sanctioning private contr acts, of mono polizing certain areas of production and certain public service s, or, should they so desire, the whole of production and every public service; of expediting or obstructing the exchange of products; of declaring war or concluding peace with govern ments from other countries; of granting or withholding franchises , etc. Governors, in short, arc those who, to a greater or lesser extent, arc empowered to make use of society's resour ces, or of everyone's physi cal, intellectual and economic wher ewithal, in order to compel everyone to do their will.

More over, be they good or bad, wise or ignorant, what are governments? Who appoints them to their elevated position? Do they prevail of thems elves by right of war, conquest or revol ution? In which case, what assur ance does the people have that they are prom pted by considerations of general useful­ ness? It is a straightf orward matter of usurpation; and their subjects, should they be unha ppy, have no recourse but fo rce if they are to shrug off the yoke . Are they chosen by a class, by a party? In which case it is the interests and ideas of that class which will preva il, while others' wishes and interests will be sacrificed. Are they elected by universal suffrage? In which case the sole criterion is numbers, which is assur edly no proof either of equ ity, reason or competence. Those elected will be the ones best able to gull the masses, and the minority , which may well be a half minus one, will be sacrificed: and that is without taking into account the fact that experience te aches there is no way of devising an electoral machinery to ensur e that those elected are at least truly representati ve of the majority. Many and varied are the theories by means of which attempts have been made to explain away and justify the existence of gover nment.

If, say authorit arianism 's theoretic ians, an individu al's interests, inclin ations and desires are at odds with those of another individu al, or even of society as a whole, who is to be entitled and empowered to compel him to respect the interests of the others?

So runs the theory: but, if they are to be just, theories must be founded upon facts and have the capacity to explain them, and we know that in social econo my, theories are all too often devised in justification of facts, which is to say, in defense of privilege and in order to have it blithely accepted by those who are its victims. Let us examine the facts instead. Throughout the whole course of histor y, as well as in our own day, gov­ ernment has been, either the brutal, violent, arbitrary rule of a few over the mass, or a tool designed to guarantee the rule and the privilege those who, on fo ot of fo rce or guile or heredi ty, have laid claim to all of the wher ewithal of existenc e, particula rly the soil, and utilize it in order to keep the people in servitude and to have it work fo r them. Men are doubly oppressed: either direc tly, by brute fo rce and physical violence; or indirec tly, by being denied the means of subsistenc e, thereby reducing them to powerle ssness. The fo rmer mode is the source of power, that is, political privilege; the second is the root of economic privilege. Men can fu rther be oppre ssed by working upon their intellect and their fe elings, as represented by religious or \"academic\" power, but since the mind is merely a product of material fo rces, fa lsehood and the bodies set up in order to peddle it have no reason to exist except insofar as they are the product of economic and political privilege, a means of defending and consolidating the latter. Today, gover nment, made up of proper ty-owner s and of people in their service, is whol ly at the disposal of the prop ertied: so much so that the wealthiest often even disdain to belong to it. Rot hschild has no need to be either deput y or minister: it is enoug h that he has deputies and minister s to do his bidding. In many countri es, the proletariat nominall y enjoys a greater or lesser part in the election of the government . This is a concession granted by the bour geoisie , either in order to secure popular backing in its struggle against ro y al or aristocratic power, or in order to divert the people away from the notion of self-emancipation, by affording it a semblance of sovereig nty. Whether or not the bourgeoisie anticipated this, from the moment it granted 358 ERRICO MALATESTA"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"the people the right to vote, it is a certai nty that that right turned out to be quite illusor y, good only fo r conso lidating the power of the bour geoisie, by affording the most vigorous portion of the proletariat the illusory hope of achicving power. Even with universal suffrage, we might indeed say particul arly with universal suffrage, government has remained the bourgeoisie's serf and gen­ darme. Were it otherw ise, were the government to threaten to turn hostile , if democracy could be anything other than a means of deceiving the people, the bourgeoisie, its interests in jeopardy, would make ready for revolt and would utilize all of the strength and influence afforded it by its possession of wealth in order to call the governm ent to order as a mere gendarme doing its bidding. At all times and everyw here, whatever the name by which government has been known, whatever its origins and its organiza tion, its essential fu nction has always been that of oppressing and exploiting the masses and defending the oppressors and usurpers: its chief organs and vital characteristics are the gendarme and tax-collec tor, the soldier and the jailer, unfailingly joined by the peddler oflies, priest or professor, paid and protected by the government to ensla ve minds and make them suffe r the yoke without complaint. A governm ent cannot exist for long unless it conceals its natur e behind some semblance of general serviceability: it cannot ensure respect for the life of the privileged without seeming to seek respect fo r everyone's life; it cannot secure acceptance fo r the privileges of some without going through the motions of safe-guarding everybody' s rights. \"The la w,\" Kropotkin says, which is to say, those who make the law, meaning the government, \"the law has played upon man's social sentim ents in order to secur e the passage, along with moral precepts readil y acceptable to man, orders servicing the mino rity of despoil ers against whom he would have revolte d,\" A government can scarce ly want the break -up of society, because that would signif y the disappearance of victims fo r it and the ruling class to exploit.

What well-informed nun of good fa ith would dare argue that we are not social ists? Might we not be socialists because we want the workers to gain their rights throug h their organ ized efforts? Or because we want them not to cling to the-as we see it, chim eric al-hope of securing them through the concessions of some gov ernment?

Tuesd ay, August 27 AMEDEE DUNOIS: It is not so long ago that most anarchists were opposed to any notion of organization. Then, the scheme we have before us, would have drawn cou ntless object ions fr om them and its authors would have been suspected of back ward-lo oking ulterior motives and autho ritarian intent. Those were the days when anar chists, isolated fr om one another, and even more i,olated from the wor king class, seemed to have lost all social sensibility: when anarchism, with its endless appeals fo r reformation of the individ ual, appeared to man y as the highest expression of the old bour geois individ ualism. Individ ual action, \"individual initiative\" was held to be all-suf ficing. Gen erall y speaking, no one gave a fig fo r study of economics, of the fa c­ tors of production and exchange, and indeed, some of us, den ying that the class strug gle had any substance to it, refused to see in the existing society anything other than conflicts of opinion fo r which it was the precise task of \"propaganda \" to equip the individu al. As an abstract protest against the social democracy's opportu nistic and autho ritarian tenden cies, anar chism has played a consid erable role over the past twenty five years. So why, instead of sticking to that, has it attempted, in the fa ce of parliamentary social isITl, to build up an ideology of its very own? In its ERRICO MA LA TE STA 373"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"daring aeroba tics, that ideology has all too often lost sight of the solid ground of reality and practical action, and, all too often also, it had ended up coming in to land, willy-nilly, upon the fa rther shores of individ ualism. This is why, among us, organization cannot be thoug ht of any longer in anything other than terms which are inevita bly oppressi ve of the \"individ ual\" and why we have come system aticall y to repudiate any collecti ve endea vor. Ho wever, on this matter of org anization, which is the one we have before us, a telling shift is taking place. Without the shadow of a doubt, this particular shift shoul d be seen in the context of the ov erall evolution which anarchism has undergone in France over the past few years . By taking a more active hand than hitherto in the workers' movement, we have bridged the gulf separating the pure idea, which so readil y turns into inviol able dogma, from the living realit y. Less and less have we any interest in our fo rmer abstractions and more and more in the practical movement , in action: trade unionism and anti-militarism have claimed first place in our con­ sidera tions. Anarchism appears to us much less in the guise of a philosophical and moral doctrine than as a revolutionary theor y, a concrete program for social transf ormation . It is enough that we should see in it the most comprehensive theoretical expre ssion of the proletarian movement's tendenc ies. Anar chist organiza tion still provokes objections . But those objections diffe r greatl y, dependi ng upon whether they emana te fr om individualists or from syndic alists . Against the former, we need only appeal to the history of anarchism. The latter evolved as an outgrowth from the \"collec tivism \" of the Internati onal, which is to say, in the final analysis, from the workers' move ment. So it is not a recent, not the most rounded fo rm of individu alism, but rather one of the modalities of revolutionary socialism. Thus, what it refutes is not organiza­ tion: but, quite the contrar y, government, with which, Proudhon tells us, organiza tion is in compatib le. Anarchism is not individ ualist: it is primaril y fe deralist, \"associa tion- ist.\" It might be defined as: unallo yed fe deralism. Moreo ver, we fa il to see how an anarchist organization could harm the individual growth of its memb ers. No one, in fact, would be compelled to join it, nor, having joined, prevented from quitting. The objections raised fr om the individualist viewpoint against our schemes fo r anar chist organization do not stand up to scrutin y; they might as readil y be voiced against any form of society.

But should our anarchist groups confine themselyes to completing militants' education, conserving their revo lutionary vigor and allowing them to make one anot her's acquaintance and get together? Should they not be engaged in activity of their own? We think that they should. The social revo lution cannot be carried out except by the mass. But ev­ ery revolution necessar ily entails acts which, bv virtue of their, so to speak, technical character, can only be carried out by a small number, by the boldest, most expert fr action of the seething proletariat. In every distric t, every city , every region, in times of revolut ion, our groups would repre sent so nun y little combat orga nizations, assigned to carr y out special, delicate tasks, fo r which the broad masses are most often not equip ped.

CRO I S E T : What matters above all else is that I offer a defi nition of an­ archy which will serve as the basis fo r my reasoning. We are anarchists in this sense, that we seek to bring about a social condition in which the indi vidu al will find his complete liberty assured, in which everyone will be able to live his life to the fu ll: to put that another way, in which the individual will be afforded the right to live without constraints of any sort, his whole life his own, and not, as it is toda y, the life others would have him lead. I mean to say the life that others fo rce upon him. My motto is: Me, me, me ... and then the rest! Individu als ought to combine only when it has been shown that their indi vidual ef forts cannot enable them to accomplish their aim unaided. But com bination, organization ought never, on any account, to beco me a con­ straint upon him who enters fr eely into it. The indi vidu al was not made fo r society: instead, it is society that was made fo r the individ ual. Anarch y seeks to place every individual in a position where he can develop all his fa culties fr eely. Now, the inevitable outcome of organiz ation is that it always limits the fr eedom of the individual to a greater or a lesser extent. Anarch y thus opp oses any system of standing organization . In their pointless ambition to beco me practical, anarchists have made their peace with organi­ zation. It is a slippery slope on to which they are stepping, there. Some da y or another, they will wind up making their peace with authority itself , just as the social democ rats have done' Anarchist ideas must retain their ancien t purity, rather than incline to become more prac tical. So let us revert to the ancient purity of our ideas. SIEGfRIED NACHT: I will not fo llow Croiset on to the ground where he has taken his stand. It strikes me that what is in need of eluc idation above all else is the relationshi p between anarchism, or, to be more precise, anarchist organiza tions, and the labor unio ns. It is in order to fa cilitate the work of the latter that we, as anar chists , ought to set up special groups to offe r training and education fo r revo lution. The workers' movement has a mission of its own, arising out of the living ERRICO MA LA TE STA 377"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"conditions fo isted upon the prol etariat by the present societv: that mission is the conquest of economic power, and collectiv e appro priation of all of the wellsprings of production and life. That is \\v hat anarchism aspires to, but the latter could not attain it with its ideologi cal prop aganda groups alone. How­ ever fine it may be, theor y makes no deep impressio n upon the people, and it is primaril y through action that it is educat ed. Little by little, action will invest it with a revolu tionary mental ity. The general strike and direct action ideas have a very seduc tive impact upon the consciousness of the laboring masses . In the revolu tion to come, those masses will, so to speak, make up the fo ot-soldiers of the revolu tion­ ary arm y. Our anarchist grou ps, specializing in technical matters, will, so to speak, repre sent its artill ery, which, though less numerou s. is no less vital than the infantry. GEORGE THoNAR : In the anarchist idea taken as a whole, comm unism and individualism are equal and insepar able . Organization, concerted ac­ tion, is indis pen sable to the growth of anar chism and in no way contra dicts our theoretical premises. Organization is a means and not a prin ciple: but it goes without saying that if it is to be accepta ble, it should be constituted in a libertarian way. Organiza tion may have been useless in the days when there was only a very small nurnber of us anarchists, all fa miliar with one another and in fr equent contact with one another. We have become legion , and we must take care lest our strength be squander ed. So let us orga nize ourselv es, not just fo r anarchist propaganda, but also and above all fo r direct action. I am fa r fr om being hostile to trade unionism, especia lly when its inclina­ tions are towards revol ution . But, after all, the worke rs' organization is not anarchist, and as a result. inside it we will never be absolutely ours elves; our activity there can never be undil utedly anarchist. Hence, the need fo r us to set up libertarian grou pings and fe derations , fo unded upon resp ect fo r the liberty and initia tive of each and every one. K. VOHRYZEK: It is as an individualist that I wish to argue the case fo r orga nization. There is no way to pretend that anar chism, by virtue of its very principl es, could not countenance organization . The self-proclaimed indi vidu­ alist makes no radical condemnation of association between individ uals. To say, ;lS is sometimes done, either Stirner or Kropot kin, thereby pit­ ting these two think ers one against the other, is a mis take. Kropotkin :lnd Stirner cannot be contrasted one with the other: they set out the same idea 378 ERRICO MA LA TE STA"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"from differing points of view. That is all. And the proof that Max Stirner was not the dyed-in-the- wool individ ualist that has been claimed is that he spoke up in favor of \"orga nization.\" He even devoted a whole chapter to the \"Associa tion of Egoists .\" Our organization, having no executi ve power, will not be at odds with our princi ples. Inside the trade unions, we cham pion the workers' economic interests . But fo r every thing else, we should combine separate ly, to create organiza tions with libertarian fo undati ons . EMMA GOLDMAN: I too am favorable , in prin ciple , to organization. How ­ ever, I fe ar that the latter may, some day or another, lapse into exclusi vism. Dunois spoke against the excesses of individ ualism. But such excesses have nothing to do with true individ ualism, any more than the excesses of communism have anyth ing to do with real communism. I have set out my views in a report, the conclusion of which is that organization always tends, more or less, to erode the individu al personali ty. That is a danger which we have to anticipate. So I will agree to anar chist organiza tion on one condition only, that it be based upon absolute respect fo r all individual initia tive and is able to hamper neither its operation nor its evol ution. The essential princi ple of anar chy is individual autonom y. The Interna­ tional will be anarchist only if it abides by that principle complete ly. PIERRE RAMUS: I favor organization and every effort to be made among us in that direction . Yet it does not strik e me that the arguments advanced in Dun ois's submission are quite of the quality to be desir ed. We should strive to return to anarchist prin ciples as fo rmulated just now by Croiset, but, at the same time, we ought systematically to organize our moveme nt. In other wor ds, individual initia tive should depend upon the strength of the collecti ve and the collec tive should express itself through individual initiati ve. But jf this is to be achieved in practice, we must keep our basic prin ciples intact and undiluted . What is more , we are far from devising anything new. In real ity, we are the imm ediate success ors of those who , in the old Interna­ tional Work ing Men 's Association, stood with Bakunin against Marx. So we are not offering anything new, and the most that we can do is to inject fr esh life into our old princi ples, by encouraging the trend towards organization everywhere . As fo r the aim of the new International, that ought not to be to constitute an auxiliary to the fo rce of revolut ionary syndicalism, but rather to work on the dissemi nation of anarchism in its total ity.

We are quibbling over wor ds. But with regar d to the very crux of the issue, I am persuaded that everyb ody is in agreement. All anarch ists, whatever the tendency to which they belong, are, in some sense, individ ualists. But the reverse is fa r fr om being true: all individu alists are not-if only they were !-anar chists. Indi vidualists are thus divided into two quite distinct types: some demand, fo r every human indi vidual, them­ selves and others alike, the right to fu ll development -others have a care only fo r their own individuality and never hesitate to sacrifice others to it. The tsar of all the Russias belongs to these latter individual ists. We belong among the former. Ibsen's cry, that the most powerf ul man in the world is the one who is most alone, is taken up. What utter nonsens e! Dr. Stockm ann, in whose mouth Ibsen places that maxim was not a solitary in the fu ll sense of the word : he lived in a constituted society and not on some desert island. The \"solitary\" man is disbarred fr om perf orming the tiniest usef ul and produc tive task: and if anybody needs a master to watch over him, it is the man who lives in isolation . What sets the individual free, what allows him to develop all his fa culties, is not solitude but association. In order to accom plish trul y usef ul work, coop eration is essentia l, today more than ever. Of course, the association must leave its component indi­ viduals complete autonom y, and the fe deration ought to resp ect that same autonom y in its group s: preserve us fr om the belief that lack of organization is a guarantee oflibert y. All of the evidence indicates otherwi se. To take one exam ple: there are French anarchist newspapers which close their columns to all whose ideas, style or simply personality has had the misf ortune to incur the displeasur e of their cust omary editors . The upshot is that those editors are invested with a personal power that sets limits upon the comrades' fr eedom of opinion and expres sion. Thin gs would be different if those newspa pers , instead of being the personal property of such and such an individual, belonged to group s: whereup on every opinion might contend fr eely with every other opinion. There is much talk of authority and autho ritarianism. But we have to be clear here. Against the authority embodied in the State and having no purpose other than to pres erve economic slavery in soci ety, we revolt with all of our 380 ERRICO MAL AT ES TA"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"might and will never cease revolting. But there is a purely moral authority which arises out of exp erienc e, intelligen ce or talent, and, anarchists though we may be, there is not one of us but resp ects that authori ty. It is wrong to portr ay the \"orga nizers,\" the fe deralists as authorit arians , and it is also a no less great error to represent the \"anti-org anizer s,\" the individ ualists, as deliberat ely dooming thems elves to isolation . In my view, let me repeat, the squa bble betw een individualists and organizers is purely a seman tic quibble that does not stand up to atte ntive scrutin y of the £, cts. In practical realit y, what then do we see? That the \"individu alists\" are some­ times better organized than the \"organizers\" fo r the reason that the latter all too often restrict themse lves to preaching organization without practicing it. Then again, it happ ens that one finds a lot more actual authoritarianism in the groupings noisil y invoking the \"absolute freedom of the individ ual\" than in the ones ordinaril y regarded as authori tarian on the grounds that they have a bureau and make decisio ns. To put this another way: organizers or anti-org anizers, they are all orga­ nizing. Only those who do nothing or next to nothing can exist in isolation and be content with it. That is the truth : why not acknow ledge it? Evidence to back up my argument: in Italy, all of the comrades currently in the strug gle invoke my name, the \"individu alists\" and the \"organ izers\" alike, and I reall y think that they are all right, fo r, whatever their theoretical discr epancie s, they all practice collecti ve action equall y. Enough of the semantics! Let us stick to action s! Words divide and action unit es. It is time that we all set to work together to exerc ise effective influ­ ence over social happ enings. It pains me to think that in order to wrest one of our peo ple fr om the clutches of the executioners, we were obliged to look to parties other than our own. And yet, Ferrer would not be indebted to the freemasol lS and bour geois fr ee-think ers fo r his liber ty, had the an arch ists, banded together into a mighty and fe arsome Internati onal, been able, them­ selve s, to take char ge of the worldw ide protests against the criminal infamy of the Spanish gov ernme nt.

Individ ualism signif ies a very special effort in the direction of inner, moral liber ation of the individual; orga niza tion signifies associa tion between conscious individuals with an eye to some aim to be achie ved or some economic need to be satisfied. However. it is important that it should never be fo rgotten that a revol utionary orga nization has need of espec ially energetic and conscious individ uals. AMEDEE DUNO IS: Let me place it on record that I was trying to bring the discu ssion down from the heaven of vague abstractions to the terra ./in lla of concrete. precise, humbly relat ive ideas. Croiset, on the other hand, lifted it into the heavens again, to the meta physical heights where I refuse to fo llow. The resolution which I move be adopted by congress is not inspired by specu lative ideas about the individual 's entitlement to integral develo pment. It starts fi'om quite practical consi derations of the need which exists fo r our prop aganda and combat efforts to be orga nized and orchestr ated. CHRISTIAN CORNELISSEN: The re is nothing more relati ve than the notion of the individ ual. In dividuality per se does not exist in real ity, where we find it fo rever boun ded by other individ uals. The individ ualists are too apt to to rget about these de fa cto limits, and the great boon of organization resides precise ly in its making the individual consci ous of such limits by accustoming him to rec­ onciling his right to personal development with the entitlements of others. G. RIN JNVERS: I too am not hostile to orga nization either. Moreo ver, ther e is not one anarchist who is not, deep down, in fa vor of it. It all depends on the way in which orga niza tion is construed and estab lished. What has to be avoided above all else is personalit ies.

For instance, what is authority ; If it is the infiut'nce that men of real abil ity exerc ise and will always exer cise inside a grouping, I have nothing to say again st it. But the authority which is to be avoided at all costs in our ranks is that which arises fr om the fa ct that certain comrades blindly fo llow such and such.

The State is born of mili tary might; it has grown through recourse to mili tary might, and, logicall y, it is upon military might that it must rely if it is to retain its omnipotence. Wha tever the fo rm it may assume, the State is merely oppr ession organized fo r the benef it of a privileged minority. The present conflict offers a striking illustr ation of this: all fo rms of the state are embr oiled in the present war -absolutism is represented by Russia, absolutism mitigated by parliamen tarism, by German y, a State ruling over very diffe rent peo ples, by Austria, consti tutional democracy b ).

The mistortune of the peo ples, who were neverthe less all deep ly comm it­ ted to peace, is that they trusted in the State with its scheming diplom ats, in democracy and in the political parties (even the opposition parties, like the parliam entary sociali sts) to avert war.

Anar chy means no government, and thus, all the more emphatica lly, no dictatorship, meaning an absolute government, uncontrolled and without constitutional restraints. But whenever the Bolshevik revol ution broke out, it appears that our friends may have confused what constitutes a revolution against an existing government with what was implied by a new government which had just dominated the revolu tion in order to apply the brakes to it and steer it in the direction of its party political purposes. And so our friends have all but declar ed thems elves Bolshe viks. Now, the Bolsheviks are merely marxists who have remained honest, conscientious marxis ts, unlik e their teachers and mode ls, the likes ofGuesde, Plekha nov, Hyndman, Scheidem ann, Noske, etc.,2 whose fate you know. We respect their sinceri ty, we admire their energy, but, just as we have never seen eye to eye with them in theoretical matters , so we could not align ourse lves with them when they make the transition from theory to practice. But perhaps the truth is si mply this: our pro-Bolshevik friends take the expression \" dicta torship of the proletariat\" to mean simply the revolu tionary action of the workers in taking posse ssion of the land and the instrum ents of labor, and trying to build a society and organize a way oflife in which there will be no place for a class that exploits and oppresses the produc ers. Thus construed, the \"dictatorship of the prole tariat\" would be the effective power of all workers trying to bring down capitalist socie ty and would thus turn into Anarch y as soon as resistance from reactionaries would have ceased and no one can an y longer seek to compel the masses by violence to obey and work fo r him.

In reality , what we have is the dicta torship of one party, or rather, of one party's leaders: a genuine dicta torship, with its decrees, its penal sanctions, its henchmen and, above all, its armed fo rces which are at present also deployed in the defense of the revolution against its external enemie s, but which will tomorrow be used to impose the dictators' will upon the workers, to apply a brake on revol ution, to consolida te the new interests in the process of emergi ng and prote ct a new privileged class against the masses.

At which point a question is posed. What about the lazy ? Will everyone be willing to work? To which our ans wer is: yes, everyone will be willing to work, and here is the reason why : Today, the average working day is ten hours long. Lots of workers are engaged in tasks of abs olutely no use to soc iety, parti Cll­ lady in the manuL 1Cture of mil itary armaments fo r the lan d-b ased and marine serv ices.

Add to these a comider­ able number of able-bodied men pro duc ing nothing: soldie rs, priests, police, magistra tes, civil servan ts, etc. Thus we can argue, without fe ar of being accused of exaggerat ion, that out of every 100 persons capable of perf orming some work , onl y fifty turn in an effort of any real use to soc iety. It is these fifty that prod uce the entire wealth of soci ety. From which it fo llows that if everyone were to work , the wor king day, instead of being ten hours, would L'l ll to just five hours . Bear in mind, too, that in the cur rent situation, the total ofm anutactured products outweighs by four tim es, and the sum of agricultural produce by three times, the amoun t required to meet the needs of humanity -which is to say, that a human race three times as numerous could be clothed, housed, heated, fe d, in short, could have all its needs met, if the surplus production was not destroyed through waste and man y other bctors . (These production figures can be found in a little pamphlet entitled Lcs produit s de la Te rre et lcs produits de 1'll1dustrie.) So, fr om the fo regoing we can deduce the fo llowi ng conclusion: A socie ty in which everyone would do his bit fo r production and which would be content with production not greatly in excess of its needs (the excess of the former over the latter should build up a small reserve) , need require of each of its able- bod ied members only two or three hour s' labor, maybe even less.

How arc we to account fo r this anarchist entry into the trade unions? Around 18 80, an archism in France was at an impasse. It had ma naged to cut itself off fr om the burge oning worke rs' movement that was fa lling more and more under the sw ay of ref ormist social dem ocr atic po litici ans. It was walled up in a sort of ideological ivory tower, or else it had preached mi nority acti vity, in the shape of \"propaganda by deed, \" a eu phemism fo r terrorism and recourse to bom bs. Kropotkin must ha ve been one of the fir st to set things to rights and ur ge ana rc hism to break out of its impotent in sularity: \"We ha ve to be with the peo ple, which is no longer calling fo r isolated acts but rather fo r men of action in its ranks ,\" he wrote in one article. And to call fo r a resurrection of mass trade unionism along the lines of its First In ternational tore-run ner, but ten times stronger: \"Monster unions embrac ing millions of prolet arians.\" Following Kropot kin' s lead , a young an arch ist jo urnalist, Fer nand Pelloutier, who came fr om Sain t-Nazaire, publ ished an article in the libertarian review Les Te mps IlOltVCClUX in 18 98, under the title of \"A narchism and the workers' unions,\" the text of which the reader will find be low. According to him, the trade union was to be \"a practical school of anarchism,\" much as it was supp osed by communists of the Bo lshevik school to be the ante-r oom to comm unism .

He had no hesitation in arguing that trade unionism was self-suffici ent and had no need oflibertarian theoreti cians acting as chaperone s, and that the trade union should be regarded as the social combination \"par excellenc e.\" So, after Pelloutier's article , we have included a particular ly telling piece by Pouget. The anarchists' entry into the unions was an event of some signif icance. It breathed new life into the movement, bringing it a mass base and, far from becoming bogged down in \\vhat Lenin was to term \"economism,\" it was to afford it the opportunity to re-immerse itself and rediscover its bearings in a vibrant new synthesis. Revolutionary syndic alism neverthel ess carried with it an implicit risk, against which the die-har d anarchists had not been wrong to sound a note of caution. Might not corpor ative action in pursuit of short-term deman ds, in the long run, incubate a labor bureaucr acy likely to sterilize the social struggle and reduce it to a conser vatism compar able to that which the anarchists pointed to in the social democrats; As we shall see, Fernand Pelloutier , to his credit, did not overlook this hypothesis in his argument. Far-sig htedly, as ear ly as 1895, he conceded that the trade union admin istrations could \"turn into authorit ies,\" which is to say, spawn a bureaucracy . And, later, Malatesta, taking this objection fu rther, was to sound the alarm at the Amsterdam international anarchist congress in 1907 when he opined: \"Inside the labor movement the official poses a threat compar able only with parliamen tarism.\" But Pierr e Mona tte, an overly optimistic supporter of \"pure-syndi calism , was to reply that true, trade union burea ucracy \\vas not without its dangers,\" but that syndic alism carried within it enough democratic antidotes to render its officials harmless.

Elsewhere , by contrast, in Paris, Amiens, Marseilles, Roanne and a hundred other towns, anarchists admire the new spirit by which the trade unions have been moved these past two years, yet do not dare to venture into that revolu tionary field to ensure that the good seed sown by harsh experience germina tes. And, between these men, emancipated almost to the same extent , intellectuall y connected by a shared objective and by a perception here and a conviction there, regar ding the necess ity of a violent uprising, there is a lingering mistrust which keeps the fo rmer distant from comr ades held to be systematicall y hostile to all concerted action, and the latter from a fo rm of combination in which, they persist in believing, alienation of the freedom of the individual is still obliga tory. However, the rapproch ement begun in a few large industrial or manu­ facturing centers is relentlessly spreading. A comrade from Roanne only re­ cently indicated to readers of Les Te mps nouv eaux that not only have that city's anarchists at last joined the trades bodies , but that they have gained a moral authority there of real service to propaganda by virtue of the vigor and passion o f their prosel ytization. What we have learned regard ing the trade unions of Roanne, I might repeat relati ve to many trade unions in Algiers, Toulou se, Paris, Beauvais, Toulon, etc., where , worn down by libertarian propagand a, they are today studying teachings which yester day, under marxist influence, they refused even to hear tell of.

So often had they been told: \"Patience!

In the end, impleme ntation of the la w of Novemb er 2, 1R92 had such an impact that fe male and male workers called and are calling still fo r it to be rep ealed. What was the pr ove nance of such a reve rsal? The trade unions hastened to look fo r an expla nation, but, their fa ith in legislation being too rec ently acquired to be serio usl y strick en, too ignorant of social econo my to probe be yond the tang ible causes, they believed (in that the cuts in wor king hours had determined the cuts in pay) that the law would be fla wless if regulation of labor costs conld be added to regulation of hours . But the hour of disappoin tment had fina lly come. The prom ises which had made fo r refo rmist sociali sm's po wer now yielded to the prac tice, which would spell its ruination. Fresh laws ar ose, designed either to see that the pro­ ducer was paid be tter or to cater fo r his old age. But then the un ions noticed (and it is pri maril y to the women that the credit fo r this disc overy, crucial to social ism 's evol ution, must go) that the items fo r which they were paid most as producers were sold to them at increasi ngly high cost as consumers, and that as wage rates rose, so too the cost of bread, wine, meat, housing, fu rnit ure-in short, all oflif e's essential needs -ro se too; and they noticed too (and this was spelled out fo rmall y at the recent Limoges congress ) that in the last anal ysis, reti rement pensions are still fu nded out of levies upon wag es.

For a long time, the trade unions reckoned that the socialist party's weakness , or rather, the weakness of the proletariat had been primaril y, and maybe even exclu sively, attributa ble to divisions among the politi cians. The moment that Citizen X fell out with Citizen Z, or the \"bespect acled Torquem ada,\" hitherto damned by Clovis Hugues and Ferroul,.l and some prima donna from what Lafargue� has called the \"Fed eration of Socialist Unrel iables ,\" the trade unions would be split down the middle, and if it came to the mounting of some concerted action like a May Day demonstration, say, they would find their members splitting into five, six or ten fa ctions, pulling in different directions in obe­ dience to their leaders' watch words. This gave them pause fo r thought, and mistaking the effect fo r the cause, they expended what could be described as imm easur able-energy on dIorts to resolve this insoluble problem of socialist unity.o Ah, no one who has not lived among the trade unions can have any conception of the efforts made to make a reality of that chimera! Agen das, deliberati ons, manif estoes: every thing, but every thing was tried, but fo und wanting: even as agreement seemed to have been reache d, or when the discus­ sions were being wound up, more as a result of weariness than of conviction, one word would fan the spark: Guesdists, Blanq uists, die-har ds and 13rou ssists would jump angril y to their fe et to exchange insul ts and take issue with this Guesde, Vaillant and Brou sse, and this fresh outbreak of fighting would drag on for weeks , only to flare up again when scarcely it had finished. In this world, everything comes to an end. Wearying of their growing weakness and their pointless endea vors to reconcile politics, which has to do primaril y with individual interests, with economics. which has to do with the interests of society, the trade unions eventually came to understand (bet­ ter late than never) that the divisions in their own ranks had a loftier cause than the division among the politic ians, and that both of these proceeded frolll ... politics. At which point, emboldened by the manif est ineffectuality of \"social \" legisla tion, by the treachery of certain elected socialists (some of whom gave their backing to the Bercy big business interest), by the lamentable results of interference by deputies or town council ors in strikes, notably the omnibus strike, by the hostility shown towards the general strike by newspa­ pers and men whose entire policy consists of building or finding themse lves a stepping stone towards their 25 francs and sash, the trade unions decided 412 TH E FRENCH ANAR CHIS TS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"that from now on political agitations would be none of their concern , that all discussion, other than economic , would be ruthles sly excluded from their program of study and that they would devote themselves whole -heartedl y to resisting capital. Recent instances have shown how quickl y the trade unions have taken to this slant! Yet the rumor of this about-turn had been vindicated. The new watch­ word \"No more politick ing!\" had spread through the workshop s. A number of union members deserted the churches devo ted to the cult of electio neer­ ing. So, the trade union terrain seemed to some anarchists ripe to receive and nurture their doctrine, and came to the aid of those who, freed at last of parliamentary tutelage, now strove to fo cus their attention and that of their comrades upon the study of economic laws. This entry into the trade union of some libertarians made a consider able impact. For one thing, it taught the masses the true meaning of anarchism, a doctrine which, in order to make headway can very readil y, let us say it again, manage without the individual dynamiter: and, thr ough a natural lin kage of ideas , it showed union members what this trades organ ization, of which they had previou sly had only the narrowest conception, is and may yet become. Nobod y believes or expects that the coming revol ution, however fo rmi­ dable it should be, will realize unadulterated anarchist comm unism. By virtue of the fact that it will erupt, no doubt, before the work of anarchist educa­ tion has been completed, men will not be quite mature enough to organize thems elves absolutely without assistance, and fo r a long time yet the demands of caprice will stifle the voice of reason in them. As a result (and this seems a good time to spell it out), while we do preach perfect comm unism, it is not in the certainty or expectation of comm unism's being the social fo rm of the future: it is in order to fu rther men's education , and round it off as complete ly as possible, so that, by the time that the day of confl agration comes, they will have attained maximum emancipa tion. But must the transitional state to be endured necessaril y or inevita bly be the collec tivist jail?6 Might it not consist oflibertarian organization confined to the needs of production and consump­ tion alone, with all political institutions having been done away with? Such is the problem with which many minds have- right ly-b een grappl ing fo r many a long year. Now, what is the trade union?

No: as fa r as they are concerned, lawful constitution is merely an amusing means of making revol utionary propaganda under government guarantee , and anywa y, how many of them do not and will not ever figure in the unions' formal annual returns? Do they use the parliamentary mechanism in order to arrive at their resolutions? Not any more: they hold discuss ions and the most widel y-held view has the fo rce oflaw, but it is a law without sanction, observed precisely because it is subject to the endorsement of the individu al, except, of course, when it comes to resisting the employ ers. Finall y, while they appoint a chairman, a delegated supervis or, for every session, this is not now the result of habit, for, once ap­ pointed, that chairman is utter ly overlooked and himself frequently forgets the powers vested in him by his comrad es. As a laboratory of economic struggl es, detached from election contes ts, favoring the general strike with all that that implies, governing itself along anarchic lines, the trade union is thus the simultaneou sly revolutionary and libertarian organization that alone will be able to counter and succes sfully reduce the noxious influence of the collecti vist politic ians. Supp ose now that, on the day the revolution breaks out, virtua lly every single producer is orga­ nized into the unions: will these not repre sent, ready to step into the shoes of the present organization, a quasi-libertarian organization, in fact suppre ssing all political power, an organization whose every part, being master of the instru ments of production, would settle all of its affairs fo r itself, in sovereign fa shion and through the freely given consent of its members? And would this not amount to the \"free assoc iation of free producer s?\" To be sure, there are many objections: the fe deral agencies may turn into authorities; wily persons may come to govern the trade unions just the way the parliamentary socialists govern the political groupings; but such objections are only partly valid. In keeping with the spirit of the trade unions, the federal councils are merely half-way houses generated by the need to spread and make economic strug gles more and more fo rmidab le, but which the success of the revolution would make redundant, and which, also, the groups fr om which they emanate monitor with too jealous an eye for them ever to succes sfully win a directorial authori ty.

Then again, trades organization is still only in the embryonic stages.

But who can sa y where a softly-softly approach and, rather more , the fruits of freedom will have carried them in ten years' time? It is up to libert arian socia lists to commit all of their efforts to getting them there. \"The Federal Committee of the Bourses du Travail\"-say the official minutes carried by the Bulletin de la Bour se de Na rbonne -\" has as its task the instruction of the people regarding the pointlessness of a revol ution that would make do with the substitution of one State for another, even should this be a socialist State.\" That committee, states another minute due to appear in the Bulletin de la Bour se de Per pignan, \"should strive to prepare an organization which, in the event of a transf ormation of society, may see to the operation of the economy through the free grouping and render any political institution superflu ous. Its goal being the abolition of authority in an y of its fo rms, its task is to accustom the workers to shrug off tutelage .\" Thus, on the one hand, the \"union ized\" are today in a posit ion to under­ stand, study and receive libertarian teachings; on the other, anarchists need not fear that, in taking part in the corpor ative movement , they will be required to fo rswear their independ ence.

Natu rally there is no shortag e of candidates -there is something fo r every taste and in every hue; a sow could not pick out her own fa rrow.

REPRESSION But such propagan da, conducted with so much vigor, was certai nly not with­ out draw backs. Prosecutions came hot and heavy and while his editors might escape, Pouget too served his time in Saint-Pelagie , the prison of the day, not that that stopped Le Pere Peinar d from appearing, as his colleagues took it in turns to collect his copy from inside prison itself. 422 THE FRENCH ANARC HISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"A period of such intense agitation-a nd, it must be said, not just that-h ad driven a number of individuals over the edge; a series of attentats followed, culminating in the assassina tion of President CarnotS in Lyons.

Arrests followed the hundreds of house searches carried out across the coun try and a great trial, known as the \"Trial of the Thirty\" was mounte d. Pouget and quite a few other comrades put some distance between them­ selves and their would -be judg es.

The bourgeoisie was fe eling a little more reassured and Pouget went home to face the music, and was acquitted, as were all of his co-accused in the \"Trial of the Thirty.\" None of these adventures had changed the militant's fervor one iota; on May 11 the same year, Le Pere Peinard's success or, La Socia Ie, came out. For a number of reaso ns, its founder was unable fo r the time being to resurrect the fo rmer title (which reapp eared only in October 1896).

The General Conf ederation of Labor (CGT) was growing and growing and assuming an ever greater significance in so­ ciety. At Pouget's instigation, the Toulouse Congress (1897) had adopted a sig­ nificant report on Boyco tting and Sabo tage offering the wor king class a novel weap on of struggle. Finally, and this was his most cherished idea, he had dreamt of equipping the working class with a fighting journal written entirely by interested partie s. An ini tial commitment to this had been forthcoming at the Toulouse Congr ess, and had been reiterated by the Rennes Congress. What the comrades had in mind at that point was a daily newspaper, a project which they were later forced to abandon in the light of all sorts of financial difficulti es. No matter . The idea had been floated and we would do well to rememb er here that it was also thanks to Pouget's tenacity that the first edition of La Vo ix du Peu p le appeared on December 1, 1900. Poug et, who had been appointed assistant secretary of the CGT , Federa­ tions branch, was in charge of getting the newspaper out each week . Thanks to his dogged efforts and with the aid ofFe rnand Pelloutier, the working class fo r the first time ever had a newspaper all of its very own.

The entir e working class fought through his pen. However, I have to recall those splendid and unforgettable special edi­ tions on \"Drawing lots\" or \"May the first,\" conc eived and presented in such a way that it is no exaggeration to say that such intensity of propaganda has never been outdone. Let me recall, too, the campaign fo r the eight-hour working day, culmi­ nating in May 1, 1906: One has to have lived through those times alongside Pouget to appreciate what propagandistic science-and no, that does not 424 THE FRENCH ANAR CHISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"strike me as too strong a word fo r it-he deployed then.

So, there is no exag­ geration in saying that, wherever it was able to enforce its will entire ly, the working class enjoyed the eight-h our day and owes that, in no small part, to E mile Pouget. One need only review the succession of CGT congresses between 1896 and 1907 to get the measur e of the profound influence that he wielded over those labor gatheri ngs. His reports, his speeches and above all his effective work on working parties are still the most reliable index of syndic alism's debt to him.

Property and authority are merely differing manif estations and expressions of one and the same \"princi ple\" which boils down to the enforcement and enshri nement of the servitude of man. Conseq uently, the only difference between them is one of vantage point: viewed from one angle, slavery appears as a PROPERTY CRIME, wher eas, viewed from a different angle, it constitutes an AUTHORITY CRIME. In life, these \"principles\" whereby the peoples are muzzled are erected into oppre ssive institutions of which only the fa�ade had changed over the ages. At present and in spite of all the tinkering carried out on the ownershi p system and the adjustments made to the exercise of authority, quite superficial tinkerings and adjustmen ts, submission, constraint, forced labor, hunger , etc. are the lot of the laboring classes. This is why the Hell of Wage-Sla very is a lightless Gehenna: the vast ma­ jority of human beings languish there, beref t of well-being and libert y. And in that Gehenna, fo r all its cosmetic trappings of democracy , a rich harvest of misery and grief grows. ESSENTIAL ASSO CIATION The trade association is, in fa ct, the only fo cal point which, in its very com­ position, reflects the aspirations by which the wage slave is driven: being the sole agglomeration of human beings that grows out of an absolute identity of interests, in that it derives its raison d'ctre from the form of production, upon which it models itself and of which it is merely the extens ion. What in fact is the trade union? An association of workers bound together by corporative ties. Depending on the setting, this corporati ve combination may assume the fo rm of the narrower trade connection or, in the context of the massi ve industrializa tion of the 19th century, may embr ace proletari ans drawn from several trades but whose efforts contri bute towards a common endeavor.

To wit: 1. The offering of constant resistance to the exploi ter: fo rcing him to honor the improvements won; deterring any attempt to revert to past practice; and also seeki ng to minimize the exploitation through pressure fo r partial improvements such as reduction of working hours, increased pay, improved hygiene etc., changes which, although thev may reside in the detai ls, are nonetheless etTective trespasses against capitalist privi leges and attenu ation of them. 2. The trade union aims to cultivate increasing coordina tion of relati ons of solidari ty, in such a way as to facilitate, within the shortest time possible, the expropri ation of capital, that bei ng the sole basis which could possi bly mark the commencement of a thoroughgo ing transf ormation of society. Only once that legitimate social restitution has been made can any possibility of parasi tism be exclu ded. Only then, when no one is any longer obliged to work fo r someone else, wage- slavery having been done away with, can produc tion beco me social in terms of its destina tion as well as of its provenance: at which time, econo mic life being a genuine sum of reciprocal efforts, all exploitation can be, not just abolished, but rendered impos sible. Thus, thanks to the trade union, the social questi on looms with such clarity and starkness as to force itself upon the attention of even the least clear-si ghted persons; without possibility of error, the trade associa tion marks out a divid­ ing line between wage slaves and masters. Thanks to which society stands exposed as it truly is: on one side, the workers , the robbed; on the other, the exploi ters, the robb ers. TRADE UNION AUTONOMY However superi or the trade union may be to every other form of associ a­ tion, it does not fo llow that it has any intrinsi c existe nce, independent of that breathed into it by its membershi p. Which is why the latter, if they are to conduct thems elves as consci ous union memb ers, owe it to themse lves to partici pate in the work of the trade union. And, fo r their part, they would have no conception of what consti tutes the strength of this associ ation, were they to imagine that they come to it as perfect union memb ers, simply by doing their duty by the union financi ally. Of course, it is a good thing to pay one's dues on a regular basis, but that is only the merest fragment of the duty a loyal member owes to himself , and thus to his trade union; indeed, he ought to be aware that the union's value 428 THE FRENCH ANAR CHISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"reside s, not so much in the sum of their monetary contributions as in multi­ plication of its memb ers' coher ent endea vors. The const ituent part of the trade union is the individual. Except that the union member is spared the depressing phenomenon manifest in democratic circles where , thanks to the veneration of universal suffrage, the trend is to­ wards the crushing and dimin ution of the human personali ty. In a democratic setting, the elector can avail of his will only in order to perform an act of abdication: his role is to \"a ward \" his \"vote\" to the candidate whom he wishes to have as his \"repr esentat ive.\" Affiliation to the trade union has no such implications and even the greatest stickler could not disco ver the slightest tresp ass against the human personal ity in it: after, as well as before, the union mem ber is what he used to be. Autonomous he was and autonomous he remains. In joining the union, the worker merely enters into a contract -wh ich he may at any time abjure-with comrades who are his equals in will and potential, and at no time will any of the views he may be induced to utter or actions in which he may happen to participate, imply any of the suspension or abdication of personality which is the distinguishing characteristic and badge of the ballot paper. In the union, say, should it come to the appointment of a trade union council to take charge of adminis trative matters, such \"selection\" is not to be compared with \"electio n\": the form of voting custo maril y employed in such circumstances is merely a means wher eby the labor can be divided and is not accom panied by any delegation of authority . The strictly prescribed duties of the trade union council are merely admini strati ve. The council performs the task entrusted to it, without ever overru ling its princi pals, without supplant­ ing them or acting in their place. The same might be said of all decisions reached in the union: all are restrict­ ed to a definite and specific act, whereas in democ racy, election implies that the elected candidate has been issued by his elector with a carte blanc he empow ering him to decide and do as he pleases, in and on everything, without even the hindrance of the quite possi bly contrary wishes of his princi pals, whose op­ position, in any case, no matter how pronou nced, is of no conseq uence until such time as the elected candidate' s mandate has run its course. So there cannot be any possible parallels, let alone confusion, betw een trade union activity and participation in the disappointing chores of politics.

The bour geoisie has contrived to preach resignation and patience to the people by holding out the hope that progress might be achieved miraculou sly and without effort on their part, through the State's intervention from without. This is nothing more than an extension, in less inane fo rm, of millenaria n and crude religious belief s. Now, while the leaders were trying to substitute this disappointing illusion fo r the no less disa ppointing religious mirage , the work ers, toiling in the shadows , with indomita ble and unfailing tenac ity, \\vere building the organ of liberation to which the trade union amounts . That organ, a verit able school for the will, was fo rmed and developed over the 19th centur y. It is thanks to it, thanks to its econo mic character that the workers have been able to survi ve inocu lation with the virus of politics and defy every attempt to divide them. It was in the first half of the 19th century that trades associ ations were established, in spite of the interdicts placed upon them. The persec ution of those who had the effrontery to unionize was ruthless, so it took ingenuity to give repression the slip. So, in order to band together without undue dang er, the workers disguised their resistance assoc iations behind anod yne exteriors, such as mutual societie s. The bour geoisie has never taken umbrage with charita ble bodies, knowing very well that, being mere pallia tives, they cannot ever offe r a remed y tor the curse of poverty . The placing of hope in charity is a soporific good only fo r preventing the exploited from reflecting upon their dismal lot and searching fo r a solution to it. This is why mutu al associations have always been tolera ted, if not, encouraged, by those in charge. Workers were able to profit from the tolerance shown these groups: under the pretext of helpi ng one another in the event of illness, of setting up retire­ ment homes, etc., they were able to get together, but in pursuit of a more manl y objective: they were preocc upied with bettering their living conditions and aimed to resist the employers' demands . Their tactics were not always 430 THE FRENCH ANARC HISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"succe ssful in escaping the attentions of the authorities which, having been alerted by complaints fr om employ ers, often kept these dubi ous mutual aid societies under surveill ance. Later, by which time the wor kers, by dint of experience and acting fo r thems elves, felt strong enough to defy the law, they discarded the mutualist disguise and boldl y called their associa tions resistance societies. A splendid name! expressi ve and plain. A program of action in itself. It is proof of the extent to which worke rs, even though their trades associa tions were still in the very early stages, sensed that they had no need to trot along behind the politicians nor amalgamate their interests with the interests of the bour geoisie, but instead should be taking a stand against and in opposition to the bour geoisie. Here we had an instinc tive incipient class strug gle which the Interna­ tional Working Men's Associa tion was to provide with a clear and defin itive fo rmulation , with its announcement that \"the emancipation of the workers must be the workers' own doing.\" That fo rmula, a dazzling affirmation of workers' strength, purged of all remnants of dem ocratism, was to fu rnish the entire prolet arian movement with its key-note idea. It was, moreover, merely an open and categorical af­ firmation of tendenc ies germinati ng among the people. This is abundan tly demonstrated by the theoretical and tactical concordance between the hith­ erto vague, underground \"trade unionist\" movement and the International's openi ng declaration. After stating as a principle that the workers should rely upon th eir own unaided efforts. the Internati onal' s declaration married the assertion of the neces sity of the proletariat's enjoying autonom y to an indication that it is only through direct action that it can obtain tangi ble results: and it went on to sa y: Given, That the economic subjection of the worker to those who hold the means oflabor, which is to say, the wherewithal oflif e, is the prime cause of political, moral and material servitude; The economic emancipation of workers is, consequen tly, the great goal towards which every political movement should be striving ( . .. ) THE FRENCH ANAR CHISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS 431"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Thus, the International did not confine itself to plain proclamation of workers' autonom y, but married that to the assertion that political agitations and adjust­ ments to the fo rm of the government ought not to make such an impression upon workers as to make them lose sight of the economic realiti es.

Except that when the International was setting out its premi ses, the work­ ers' will was still much too clouded and the proletariat's class consciousness too under-developed for the economic approach to preva il without the pos­ sibility of deviation . The working class had to contend with the distracting influence of seedy politicians who, regarding the people merely as a stepping- stone , flatter it, hypnotize it and betray it. More over, the people also let itself be carried away by loyal , disinterested men who, being imbued \\vith demo cratism. placed too great a store by a redundant State. It is thanks to the dual action of these elements that, in recent times (be­ ginning with the hecatomb of 1871), the trade union movement vegetated fo r a long time, being torn in several directions at once. On the one hand, the crooked politicians strove to bridle the unions so as to tie them to the govern­ ment's apron strings: on the other, the socialists of various schools beavered away at ensuring that their fa ction would prevail. Thus, one and all intended to turn the trade unions into \"interest groups\" and \"affl11ity groups.\" The trade union movement had roots too vigor ous, and too inelucta ble a need fo r such divergent efforts to be able to stunt its devel opment . Today, it carries on the work of the International, the work of the pioneers of \"resis­ tance soc ieties\" and of the earliest combinations. To be sure, tendenc ies ha ve come to the surface and theories have been clarified, but there is an absolute concordance between the 19th century trade union movement and that of the 20th century: the one being an outgrowth of the other. In this there is a logical extension, a climb towards an ever more conscious will and a displa y of the increasi ngly coordinated strength of the proletariat, blossom ing into a growing unity of aspirations and action . THE TASK IN HAND Trade union endea vor has a double aim: with tireless persistenc e, it must pur­ sue betterment of the working class's current conditio ns. But, without letting 432 THE FRENCH ANAR CHISTS IN THE TRADE UNIONS"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"themse lves become obsessed with this passing concern, the workers should take care to make possible and imminent the esse ntial act of comprehensive emanci pati on: the expro priation of capital. At present, trade union action is designed to win partial and gradual improvements which, fa r fr om constituting a goal, can only be considered as a means of stepping up demands and wresting fu rther improvements from capi talism. The trade union offers employers a degree of resistance in geometric proportion with the resistance put up by its mem bers: it is a brake upon the app etites of the expl oiter: it enforces his resp ect fo r less draconian wor king conditions than those entailed by the individual barg aining of the wage slave opera ting in isolation. For one-sided barg aining between the employer with his breast-plate of capital, and the defenseless prole tarian, it substitutes col­ lecti ve bargaining. So, in opposition to the employer there stands the trade union, which mitigates the despica ble \"labor market\" and labor supp ly, by relieving, to some extent, the irksome consequences of a pool of unemployed wor kers: exac ting from the employer resp ect fo r workers and also, to a degree pro­ portionate with its strength, the union requires of him that he desist fr om offering privileges as bribes.

In fact, the commandeering of land and factories by the Spanish workers was not designed merely to bring pressure to bear upon the propri­ etors, managers and public auth orities in order to secure improved work ing conditions and pay: instead, it was well and truly aimed at vesting direct management of the means of production and exchange in all who operated them-and, in the case of lands left: fallow or inefficient firms, this \"taking charge\" was in the nature of an authentic social rescue measure. Handi capped on the world market for farm produce and industrial products by a parasitical admin istration as well as competition from new countries, bourgeois Spain had not the ability to help its unemployed nor to make proper use of its own soil and grow its own food. The response of the Spanish workers and peasants to that was an act of fair­ ness and respo nsibility performed by the rank and file, eschewing all bureau­ cracy and party political dictatorship, enabling the country to fe ed itself. On July 19 and the days that followed, every large undertaking was aban­ doned by its directors.

In any case, the influence of anarchist teach ings upon this change- over cannot be questioned. For man y a long year, Spai n's anarchists and syndicalists had regarded the social transformation of society as their ultimate objective. In their trade union asse mblies and groups, in their newspapers, pamphlets and books, the issue of social revolut ion was endlessly and system atically discussed. What should happen once the proleta riat had won? The machinery of government had to be dismantled. The work­ ers had to operate their firms for themselves, admin ister themselves and the unions should oversee all economic activity. The industrial federations had to run produ ction: local feder ations would see to consump tion. Such were the ideas of the anar cho-syndical ists, ideas to which the FAI subscribed also. In its conferences and congresses, the latter had conti nually reiterated that economic life should be run by the trade unions. (00.) After 19 July 1936, the CNT unions took charge of production and supply. At first, the unions strove to resolve the mo st pressing problem : keeping the population supp lied. In every district, canteens were set up on the union premises. Supply committees took it upon themselves to seek out provisions in the central depots in the tow ns, or in the countryside. These provisions were paid for with vouchers whose value was guarant eed by the unions. Every union member and the wives and children of militians, as well as the general populace were all fe d fr ee of charge. During strikes, workers got no wages. The Antifascist Militias Committee decided to pay workers and staff however much they would have earned had they worked those days .

In every workshop, office, bureau or retail outlet, trade union delegates were appointed to act as the man agers .

Wa ges had been increased and the profit margin - sacrosanct in bour geois economic s-was put towards the fight against fa scism. In this way, in most firms, the man agement of prod uction was assumed by the workers. As long as they resisted the new economic management, the bosses were shown the door. They were allowed in as workers if they agreed to the new arrangements. In which case, they would be taken on as techni­ cians, business directors or, indeed, as sim ple workmen. They received a wage equ ivalent to that earned by a worker or technician fo llowing that trade. That start and these changes were compa rat ively rather straigh tforward. Dif ficulties emerged later. After rather a short time, raw materials ran out. In the fmt fe w days after the Revo luti on, raw materials had been requisitioned. Later, they had to be paid tor, which is to say, entered in the accounts . Very fe w raw materials arrived fr om abroad, leading to an esc alation in the prices of raw materials and fin ished goods. Wa ges were increased, but not across the boar d. In some industr ies, the increase was considera ble. During the tlrst phase of collecti vization, the wages of workers or staf f dif fered , even within the sam e indus try. ( ... ) The unions decided to look to the control of firms themse lves. Fac­ tory unions turned into industrial enterpris es. The Bar celona construction union took cha rge of work on dif ferent building sites in the city. Barber shops were collecti vized.

The latter was to embrace all of the economic commit­ tees from the various union s, funds were to be concentrated in a single place, and an equal ization fu nd would ensure that fu nds were proper ly allocated. In certain industr ies, this liaison committee and equalizat ion fund had been in existence from the outset . The Barcelona Bus Compan y, a profita ble under­ taking run by its workf orce had excess revenues. A portion of that revenue was set aside fo r the purchase of materials abroad. A further portion was set aside for the upkeep of the Tram Compan y whose revenues were lower than those of the Bus Compan y. When petrol became scarce, 4,000 taxi drivers became unemployed. Their wages still had to be paid by the union. This was a heavy burden upon the Transport Union. It was fo rced to seek assistance from two other unions and from Barcelona corporation. In the textile indus try, because of the dearth of raw materi als, working hours had to be reduced. In certain plants, they were down to a three-day week. However, the workers had to have their pay. As the Textile Union did not have the fu nds at its disposal, the Generalidad had to pay the wages instead. The collec tivization process could not rest there. Trade unionists pressed fo r socializa tion. But socializat ion does not, to them, signif y nationalization, or State direc tion of the economy. Socialization is to be generalized col­ lectivization. It is a matter of gathering the capital from various unions into one central fund: concen tration at local fe deration level turned into a sort of comm unal economic enterprise. It boils down to a bottom-up sociali zation of workers' activities at commune level. COLLE CTIV IZATION IN AGRICUL TURE Not just in Catalonia, but also in every other part of Spain, collec tivist tradi­ tions went deep. Once the power of the generals had been defeated, there was a discernible general aspiration favoring collect ivization of the existing large estates. The trade union organizations and anarchist groups placed themselves at the head of this campaign for collec tivization. They kept faith with their traditio ns. Collectivization of the land in Spain proceeded along different lines from the ones in Russia. Agric ultural propert y, at commune level, was collec tivized if it had previou sly belonged to a large landowner . The latter had sided with the clerical-military clique and against the people. Those landowners who had THE SPANIS H COLLECTI VES 443"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"agreed to the economic changes were able to go on working under the super­ vision of the union which spea r-headed the collectivizat ion. Exporters also went over to the union and, in several places, so too did the small-holders. The land and prope rty were worked in common by the rural workers, all prod uce being handed over to the union which paid the wages and mar­ keted the produce. Those small-holders unwilling to join the trade union operated on the outside of the collectivizatio n. They had a hard struggle to make a living. No pressure was brought to bear on them, but the advantages of collective production were not extended to them either. Inside the union, on the other hand, work was organized along rational lines . The principle of \"all for one and one for all \" really did apply there. So, the small-holder lived apart from the commune (or comm uni ty) . When it came to the sharing out of farm machinery, food prod uce, etc., the small-holder is at the back of the queue .3 The farmworkers' union today constitutes an economic enterprise. The clea ning and packaging of different fruits destined for shipment are entrusted to union supervis ion . Workers get their wages from the uni on. In certain communes, economic life as a whole is in the unions' han ds. The union has appoin ts several committees to organize work, oversee consumption and dis­ tribution and the fight against fascism. Insofar as they exist, cafes and cinemas are under trade union control. In small localities, there is no difference between the various trades uni ons or crafts sectio ns. They are all amalgamated into a local federation which represents the economic nerve center as well as the political and cultural hub of the comm une. In one sector, there was no collectivizat ion: banking. So how come the banks were not organized? The bank staffs were barely organized. They belo nged, not to the CNT unions, but to the unions of the UGT which is against collectivizatio n. The socialist UGT , in fact, has a differ­ ent traditi on. Its ideology is social democratic and it aims at State ownership . According to that outlook, socialization has to be implemented by the State through decrees.

After seven months of collecti vizations, the union s, in the light of their experien ces, observed that all of the collec tivized unde rtakings across a range of industries stood in need of coordination. So, they worked on the basis of first-hand experience. The central directo ry, which has been established today, need not bother itself with the creation of subordi nate bodies, as these already exist. The edifice of collecti vization rests on a solid fo undation , based on the industrial union, its trades sections in firms and the workshops themse lves. The unions also entertained the notion of regulating suppl y, without, howe ver, intending to claim a monopoly there. The Foodstuf fs Union took over the operation of the bakeries. (In Barcelona, there are no large bakerie s, no bread factories.) Alongs ide the latter, there are still little bakers' shops operating as betore.

The aim was to organize and orchestrate supply genera lly right across Catal onia, in such a way that every area's needs might be met. A uniform price was set by the collectivized comm unes, the fishermen's unions and other fo od suppl iers, in accordance with availability . The object of this economic policy was to prevent rises in fo od prices. In which case specu lators and hoarders could be elimina ted. In mid-D ecem ber, this policy was set aside.

The regional federation of collec tives is hereby consti tuted, for the purpose of coordinating the region's economic potential, and in order to afford solida ry backin g to that fe derat ion, in accordance with the principles of autonom y and fe deralism which are ours. 2. In the constitution of this fe deration, the following rules must be ob­ served: a) collec tives must fe derate with one anothe r at cantonal level; b) in order to ensure that the cantonal committees achieve cohesion and mutual control, a REGIO NAL COMMITTEE OF COLLE CTIVES is to be established. 3. The collec tives are to make precise inventory of their output and their consum ption, which they are to forward to their respec tive cantonal comm ittee- which is to forward it to the regional committee. 4. The abolition of money in the collec tives and its replacement by ration card will make it possible for the requisite amounts of basic necessities to be made available to each collecti ve. 5. So that the regio nal comm ittee may see that the collect ives are supplied with imported goods, the collectives or the cantonal committees shall furnish the regional committee with a quantity of products reflecting the wealth of each locality or canton, so as to build up the regio nal fu nd fo r external trade.

And, with regard to anything having to do with tilled lands , working tools , fa rm mach inery and the raw materials set aside fo r them, these are to be made available to collect ives which may be lacking in them. 2. An appeal is to be issued to those collec tives with a surplus of man-power or which, at certain times in the year, are not using all of their producers because their services may not yet be required, and the available teams may be put to work, under the supervision of the cantonal committee, to bolster those collec tives which are short of man-p ower. III. POLICY WITH REGARD TO LOCAL COU NCIL S AND SMALL-HOL DERS 1. Relations with local councils: a) Local councils made up of representatives from the various antifascist organizations have a specific, wholly lawful fu nction, as acknowledged by the Aragon Regional Defense Committee. b) The administr ative councils of collect ives perform a fu nction clearly distin ct from that of the local and cantonal council s. c) But as the trade unions are called upon to appoint and monitor the delegates to the two aforementioned functi ons, they can be performed by the same comrade , it being understood that he ought not to mix th em up in any way. 2. Relations with small -holders : a) Be it understood that small- holders who, of their own volitio n, hold aloof from the collec tives, have no right to require labor services or services in kind from it, since they claim that they can meet their own needs fo r themse lves. b) All real estate, rural and urban, and other assets which belonged to seditious personnel at the moment of expropriation and which are incorporated into the collec tive, become collec tive prope rty.

It has to be noted that one hundred kilos of unrefined rice produces sixty kilos of white rice.

The significance of agriculture in the first four of these provinces, all of which border the Mediterranean and are among the richest provinces in Spain, and the size of their population (almost 3,300,000 people) add to the profile of the social experiments which have been carried out there. In our view, it is in Levante, on account of its natural resources and the creativity of our comrades, that the work of the agrarian collectives has been conducted on the largest scale and been handled best. ( ... ) Of the five provinces, the movement has been most extensive in Valencia. This can be explained, first, in terms of its great importance: it had a population of 1,650,000 when the revolution came. Next, in descending orde r, came the province of Murcia, with its 622,000 inhabitants, Alicante with 470,000, Castellon de la Plana with 312,000, and finally, Albacete with 238,000. The number of collectives reflected the size of the population. But it was in Valencia province that the socializations proceeded at the most con­ sistent and accelerated rate. ( ... ) At the time of the congress of the Levante Peasant Federation on November 21-23, 1937, the collectives numbered 430. Five months on, there were five hundred. To get the measure of these figures, we ought to point out that the five provinces together had a total of 1,172 municipalities, ranging from the largest city down to the tiniest village. Which means that in 43 percent of the settlements in Spain's wealthiest farming region, where, in the huerta\" of Valencia, the population density was the world's highest at 450 people per square kilometer, five hundred agrarian collectives sprouted in twenty months.

In Levante, as in the remainder of Spain's regions, the authorities had remained in place, as had the Assault Guards, the Carabineros and troops commanded by officers who displayed no revolutionary mentality at all. Thus, right from the beginning, it was hard to carry out collectivization at the same dogged rate as in Aragon. Also, in the Levante region, the size of villages, which were often like small towns, also made it hard to win the unanimous backing of the populace: political and social divisions there were more plainly marked and the different tendencies better organized. In Levante, the collectives were almost always launched at the instigation of the local peasants' unions: but it did not take them long to become an au­ tonomous organization. An external link to the trade union, which represented the necessary meeting place between collectivists and individualists was all that was retained. In fact, the individualists used to bring along their produce for exchange against something else. In practice, therefore, their isolationism was entirely dissolved into the intermediary activity of the union, which had been overhauled structurally to cope with this new mission. Commissions had been set up under it aegis-rice commissions, orange commissions, hor­ ticultural commissions, potato commissions, etc.-each with its harvest and distribution depot. The collective itself had its own depot and commissions. Later, this pointless duplication was done away with. The depots were amal­ gamated: the commissions were manned by collectivists and by individualists who were union members. Other collectives set up mixed commissions: such as purchasing commissions buying machinery, seed, fertilizers, insecticides, veterinary products, etc. They used the same trucks. Solidarity was extended. And the collectivist mentality was increasingly attractive to those who had misglvll1gS. ( ... ) This network quickly tended to amalgamate and rationalize every­ thing. Rationing and the family wage were introduced at cantonal level, with the richest villages helping the poorest through go-between cantonal commit­ tees. A corps of technicians was established in each cantonal center; it comprised book-keepers, an agronomist, a veterinarian, an expert in combating plant diseases, an engineer, an architect and an expert in commercial affairs. ( ... ) Every collective had its vet. Most of the engineers and vets joined the CNT trade union. There was also a large number of agronomists.

But the vet also consulted the arch itect and the engineer over the con­ struction of pigg eries , stable s, byre s, and collec tive poultry hous es. Work was planned spontaneou sly. The planning took place at grassroots level , fr om the bottom up, in accordance with libertarian princip les. Thanks to the engineers, a huge number of canals and artesian we lls had been constructed, the better either to irrigate the soil, which was scarce, or to tran sform waterless soil. By means of vac uum pumps, water was captured and distri bute d. This was scarce ly a new techniq ue, but it was, in fa ct, a novelty fo r ma ny of the region's villages . The highly porous natur e of the soil and the meager rainf all-400 mms. on average- had always made it very hard to bring up water fo r which one had to go down 50, 100 or 200 meters below the surf ace.

The same situation obtained where rice was concerned. There were 30,000 hectares given over to rice in the province of Valencia alone, out of the 47,000 hectares under rice in the whole of Spain. This was true also of fresh vegetables-the hurrta of Valencia and the gardens of Murcia produced two or three crops each year.

If there were enough factories in existence to cope with the available raw materials, the proposal was turned down and that decision explained. If the initiative was a viable one, the proposal was endorsed. But the work was not left to the local collectives unaided.

The closure of many of the markets in Europe, and the loss of the domestic markets occupied or cut off by Franco's troops, and the obstacles placed in the way of socialization by the government, exacerbated the problem.

The Decree of October 24, 1936, and partiwlarly this last-mentioned provision, have been quite perceptively glossed by certain anarchist authors like Vernon Richards in his Lessons of the Spanish Revolu tion (1953). But the decree was the inevitable consequence of the anarchists' deliberate decision, 0/1 the morrow 4 the Francoist putsch, to forswear, in the interests of antifascist unity of action, the immediate introduction of libertarian communism and to take their place in the appendages of the petit bourgeois republican State which was intent upon exercising its ri,l!.hts of supervision while simul­ taneously safe-guarding small proprietors (See Volume IV). As to \"State\" inteiference in the economic power of the workers, that was obvious, but the National Conf ederation of Labor (CNT) itself wielded great irifluence in the Generalidad of Catalonia and the Decree was, in part at least, the handiwork of anar­ chists. It should be added that it was prompted by a concern for economic integration and a remarkable sensibility to socialist planning. It was anticipated that in every industry, there would be all industrial council made up of workers, trade unionists, alld techni­ cians, whose task it would be to \"lay down the industry's work plans and regularize production in their sector\"(Article 25). In every firm, output would have to \"conform to the overall plan laid dowlI by the industrial council\" (Article 12). For all its shortcomin�s and limitations, the Decree of October 24,1936 represents the first legislative document since the Russian Revolution of October 1917, to attempt to defille, with an eye to socialist planning, how workers' power ill the larger concerns and workers' control in the smaller workshops or craft shops might be exercised democratically. The Decree, of course, is open to criticisms, but it does not deserve, perhaps, all of the onslauclZhts which it has suffered from anarchist sticklers and \"collncilists\" (supporters of workers' councils) today.

He was along on the workers' march on the Winter Palace, led by Father Gapon. A little later, he was present at the birth of the fl fSt soviet in Saint Petersburg. Arrested by the tsarist police and imprisoned and finally deported to Siberia, he managed to escape in 1907, making his way to France. It was in Paris that Voline became an anarchist. As a member since 1913 of the International Anti- War Action Committee, his activities led to his being placed under arrest in 1915. Threatened with internm ent in a concentration camp, Voline successf ully sailed aboard a steamshi p, as a coaltrimmer, fo r the United States. For several months past, he had been sending correspondence from Paris to a Russian anarcho-syndi calist weekl y Go los Tr uda (\"The Voice of Labor\") in Americ a. In 1917, its editors-and with them, Voline-ar­ rived in revol utionary Russia, intent upon transf erring the weekl y to Saint Petersburg. Around this time Russian anarchists who had stayed behind in Europe (and who were under the sway of Peter Krop otkin's ideas) and those who had spent some tinle in America were reconciled with olle another, as manif ested in a declar ation, followed up by an organization which then took as its name: the Petro grad Anarcho -Syndicalist Propaganda Union and decided to bring out Go los Tr uda, which was regarded as the contin uation of the American publication. Voline was selected to edit it. After the October revol ution, Gol os Tr uda turned to daily publication and Voline had the help of an editorial panel which included, among others , Alexander Schapiro. At a time when the proletarian revol ution was only a few month s old, Voline was already issuing terribly prophetic warnings in that paper: \"Once their power has been consolidated and legalized, the Bolsheviks [ ...

A little later, he joined the news­ paper Nabat (\"The To csin\") and became one of the prime movers behind a Ukrainian anarchist conf erence in Ku rsk on November 18, 1918. At that conf ere nce, he was commissioned to draf t the res olut ions passed and to draw up a declaration agreea ble to every one of the schoo ls of anar ch ism, so that they all mig ht work together ins ide a common fr ame work . The draf ting of a program led Vol ine to articulate the idea of an \"anarchist synthesis\" which could embrace all three schools of anar chism: the anarcho-synd icalist. the libertarian comm unist and the individ ualist. A second Nahat cong ress was held in Ma rch- April 1919 . Participants declared themse lves to be \"categorica lly and irr eversi bly opposed to all par­ ticipation in the sovie ts, which have beco me pu rely political bodies, org anized on authorita rian , centralist and Statist fo undation s.\" This declaration was very poor ly rec eived by the Bolshevik authoriti es.

And the authentic liberating Revolution will once again be smothered, by the \"revol utionaries\" themselv es. ( ... ) From October 1917 on, the Russian revolution entered quite new terrain: that of the great social revolu tion. Thus, it proceeded along a very specific route, virgin territory. From which it fo llows that the subsequent progress of the Revolution was of a quite novel and origi nal sort. [ ... j Through all of the crises and fa ilures that followed one upon another up until the Revol ution of October 1917, Bolsheyism alone put the case fo r a social revol ution to be carried out. Not counting the (Left) Social Revolu­ tionary doctrin e with its similarities to Bolshevism in terms of its political , authorit arian, Statist and centralistic outlook, and a fe w other small kindred currents , a second fundamental idea, which also envisaged a frank, thorough­ going social revol ution emerged and spread through revolutionary ranks and made head way among the laboring masses also: this was the anarchist idea. Its influence, initially very slight, grew as events broadened their scope. By the end of 1918, this influence had become such that the Bolsheviks, who would brook no criticism, let alone contradiction or op position, were seriou sly worried. From 1919 on, and up until the end of 1921 , they were to wage a very savage strug gle against this idea's onward march: a struggle at least as long and as bitter as the strug gle against the reaction had been. On this score, let us stress a third fa ctor \\vhich is not sufficiently appreci­ ated: Bolshevism, once in power, fo ught against the anarchist and anarcho­ syndic alist ideas and movem ents, not at the level of ideological or practical experi mentati on, not by means of open, above board strug gle, but with the same methods of repression that it emplo yed against reactionar ies, unadulterat- 478 VOLINE"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"edly violent metho ds.

It doom ed the masses to not hearing the anarchist voice or to misconstruing it. And since, in spite of these impedimen ts, the idea gained ground, the Bolsheviks quickl y moved on to more violent measur es: imprisonm ent, proscri ption and death sentenc es. So, the unequal struggle between the two tenden cies, one of them in power and the other opposed to power, escalated and spread and in certain regions, resulted in fu ll-sca le civil war. In the Ukraine, in particul ar, this state of war dragged out fo r more than two years, obliging the Bolsheviks to mobilize all their resources in order to smother the anarchist idea and crush the popular movements drawing their inspiration from it. So, the strif e between the two appr oaches to social revol ution and, by the same token, between the Bolshevik authorities and certain movements of the toiling masses occu pied a very important place in the events of the years between 1919 and 1921. Tw o CONFLICTING IDFAS C . . . ) The Bolshevik idea was to erect upon the ruins of the bour geois State a new \"workers' State,\" to establish a \"worker and peasant government\" and introduce the \" dicta torshi p of the proletariat.\" The anarchist idea was to overhaul the economic and social fo undations of soci ety without resorting to a political State, government or \"dictatorship\" of any descr iption, which is to say to carry out the Revo lution and resolve its difficult ies, not by political and State means, but by means of the natural , unforced economic and social activity of the workers' very own assoc iations , once the last capitalist government had been over thrown. In order to coor dinate activity, the first of these outlooks envisaged a central political authority, orche strating the lif e of the State to abet the government and its agents, in accordance with fo rmal directives emanating from the \"center.\" The alternative approach implied jettisoning political and State organization once and fo r all; direct and fe derative arrangements between economic , social, technical or other bodies (trade unions, cooperative s, various assoc iations, etc.) at local, regio nal, national and international levels; signif ying not a political, statist centralization reaching out from the government at the center to the periphery controlled by it, but rather an economic and technical central ization, dictated by real needs and interests, moving from the periphery towards the VOLINE 479"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"centers and established naturally and logically in accordance with actual needs, with no domination and no comman ds.

J had to be done once the bourgeois State had been destroyed-a destruction upon which all are agreed. Along what lines should the construction of the new society proceed: statist, centralist and political, or federalist, apolitical and merely social? This was as ever the subject of disputa­ tions between the two sides: irrefutable evidence that the anarchists' central preoccupation was always nothing less than building the future. In place of the parties' thesis that there should be a \"transitional\" political, centralized State, anarchists offered their own: that there should be ongoing but immediate progress towards real economic and federative commun ity. The political parties rely upon the social structur e bequeathed by bygone ages and regimes and argue that there are constructi ve ideas implicit in tnis model. Anarchists reckon that, from the outset, fresh construction requires fl'esh methods and they advocate such methods. Whether their contention be right or wrong, it proves at any rate that they are perfectly clear as to what they want and tha t they have clear-cut constructive ideas. Generally speaking, a wrong-headed , or, most often, knmving ly incor­ rect, interpretation argues that the libertarian approach signifies absence of all organization. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is not a ques­ tion of \"organization\" or of \"non-or ganization,\" but rather of two different organizing principles. Of necessity, every revolution begins in a more or less spontaneous -and thus confused and chaotic fashion. It goes without saying, and libertarians understand this as well as anybody else, that if a revolution remains at that stage, the primitiv e stage, it founders. Immediately following the spontaneous eruption, the organizing principle has to intervene in a revolution, as in any other human undertaking. And it is at that point that the serious question arises: what are the tenor and the basis of that organization to be' Some contend that a central leadership group, an \"elite\" group, should be f()rmed in order to take the whole endeavor in hand dnd see it through in accordance with its lights, imposing the latter upon the entire collectivity, establishing a government and organizing a State, dictating its wishes to the 480 VOLINE"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"population, imposing its \"laws\" through fo rce and violence and com bating, eliminating and even annih ilating those in dis agreement with it. Other s reckon that such a view is absurd, cont rary to the underlying trends in human evolution and, in the last analysis, more than steri le: downright dama6ring to the whole undertaking. Of course, the anarchists say, soci ety must be organi zed. But that new, nomlal and henc eforth fe asible organizing ought to proceed fr eely and soc ially and, above all, from the grassroots up. The organizing pri nciple should emanate, not fr om some center read y-made fo r the purpose of capturing the whole and ov erruling it, but the very opposite, fr om all points, arriving at coordinating centers, natural centers designed to service all these points . Of course, the organizing spirit, men with a capacity fo r organization, \"elites,\" must play their part. But everywhere and in all circumstan ces, all such human resources must par ticipate fr eely in the common undertaking as true collaborators and not as dict ators. Everyw here, they should set an example and set about marshaling, coordinating and organizing peo ple's go odwill , initia tive , exp ertise, talents and aptitude s, without dominating, sub jug ating or oppre ssing them. Such men would be true organizers and their han diwork would amount to authentic , fr uitf ul, solid orga niza tion preci sely beca use it would be natural, humane and genui nely progres sive. Whereas the other sort of \"organization,\" modeled upon that of an old soc iety rooted in oppression and expl oitati on, and conseq uen tly tailored to those two purposes, would be sterile and un stable, beca use incongruent with the new targets and thus in no way progres sive . Indeed, it would con tribute nothing to the new society: instead, it woul d take all of the blights of the old society to extremes in that onl y their app earance would have altered. Be longing to an obso lete soc iety overtaken in every resp ect and thus impos sible as a natural, fr ee and trul y human institution, it coul d not survi ve other than with the aid of some new artifice, some new tric kery , some new viol ence, fr esh oppressions and exploitations. Which would, of nece ssity, sidetrack, mislead and jeo pardize the entire revol ution. Self -evid ently, such organization would remain stalled as a loc omoti ve of the social revol ution. In no way could it serve as a \"transitional society\" (as the \"communists\" cont end) fo r such a soci ety would necessaril y have to carry at least a fe w of the seeds of the one towards which it would be evol ving -now, every authoritarian and Statist society would possess onl y residues fr om the overthrown soci ety.

According to libertarians, happy resolution of the problems of the social revo lution could only come about through the fr eely and consc iou sly col­ lecti ve , solidary dI orts of millions of men, contributing and recon ciling the whole diversity of their needs and interests as well as of their ideas, strengths and capabilitie s, their talents, aptitudes, dispositi ons, prof essional kn ow-how and expertise, etc .

ANARCHIST GUERRILLA In the wake of tbe October Revol ution, the young anarchist son of poor peasants, Nestor Makbno, had taken it upon himse lf to organize the peasant masses of the southern Ukraine socia lly and militaril y, on a basis of autonom y. It had all started with the establishment in the Ukraine of a right-wing regime imposed by the German and Austrian armies of occupation -a regime that had wasted no time in restoring to the fo rmer landlords estates which the revol utionary peasants had just wrested from them. The farm laborers took up arms in defense of what they had so recen tly won and defended it against tbe reactionari es, as well as against the ill-timed intrusions into the countryside of Bolshevik commissa rs and their unduly onerous requisitioning. This mammoth Jacquerie, married to a guerrilla war, ,vas enli vened by an avenger, a sort of anarchist Robin Hood whom the peasants nicknamed Batko (Little Father ) Makhno. The armistice on Novemb er 11, 1918 led to a withd rawal of the German -Austrian armies of occupation, ;lS well as of­ fering Makhno a unique opportuni ty to accum ulate weapons reserves and stock -pile. The congress of the Makhnovshchina embraced both peasants' delegates and delegates from the guerrillas . Indeed, civilian organization was an extension of a peasant insur gent army prosecuting a guerrilla war. It was remar kably mobile, capable of covering up to a hundre d kilometers a day, not just because it had cavalry but thanks also to its infantry who traveled aboard light horse­ drawn and spring-loaded carts. This army was organized on the specif ically libertarian foundations of volunteer service, the elective princ iple applicable to all ranks , and freely accepted discipline; the rules of the latter, drawn up by teams of partisans and then endors ed by general assemblies, were strictl y observed by all. \"The bonor of having eradicated Denik in's coun ter-revolution in the autumn of 1919 belongs chiefl y to the anarchist insur gents ,\" writes Piotr Arshi nov, the chronicler of the Makhnovshchina.

But once the dire threat had receded, the Red Army resumed military operations against Makhn o's guerr illas, who matched them blow fo r blow. At the end of November 1920, the Bolshevik authorities had no hesitation in laying an ambush. The officers ofMakhn o's Crimean army were invited to parti cipate in a military council. Wher eupon they were promptl y arrested by the political police, the Cheka, and shot out of hand, or stripped of their weap­ ons.

And I mentioned the name of the chairman of the Alexandrovsk Revolu­ tionary Committee, Comrade Mikhailevitch , a few other militants from Ekaterino slav. The secretary said nothing for a moment, then questioned me about the state of mind of the peasants of \"Southern Russia,\" their behavior towards the German troops and the Central Rada's2 soldiers, their attitude to the soviet authorities, etc. I made some short replies which manifestly satisfied him: persona lly, I regretted that I did not have the time to answer more fully. Then he made a telephone call to somewhere and promptly invited me to enter the office of the CEC chairman, Comrade Sverdlov. En route, my thoughts turned to the tales peddled by the counter-revolu­ tionaries as well as by revolutionar ies, by my own friends indeed, who were against the policies of Lenin, Sverdlov and Trotsky , tales to the effect that it was impossible to gain access to these earthly gods. They were, talk had it, surrounded by bodyguards and the leader of the latter only granted admission to those of whom he liked the look.

He also gave me the impression that he had more interest than him in what had been happening in the Ukraine over the past two or three months. Straight out, he said: -So, comrade, you've come from our tortured South; what work did you do down there? -The same as was done by the broad masses of the revolutionary toilers of the Ukrainian countryside . The latter, having been active participants in the Revolution, strove to secure their complete emancipation. I was, you might say, always the first among them to go down that road. Today, following the collapse of the Ukrainian revolutiomry front, I find myself moment arily stranded in Moscow. -What's that you say? shouted Comrade Sverdlo v, interrupting me.

Seemingly shaken, Comrade Sverdlov was nonetheless unable to stop repeating: Why then have they not supported our Red Guards? According to our intelligence, the South's peasants are infected by the worst Ukrainian chauvinism and have everywhere rapturously welcomed the German troops and Rada soldiers as liber ators. I could feel myself getting irritable as I set about strenuou sly rebutting Sverdlov's information about the Ukrainian countryside. I admitted to him that I myself had been the organizer and leader of several battalions of peas­ ant volunteers who waged a revolutionary fight against the Germans and the Rada and I was sure that the peasants could recruit a mighty army from among their ranks to fight them, but they could not see the Revolution's battle-f ront clearly. The Red Guard units which, with their armored trains, had fought along the railway lines without ever straying far from them, withdra wing at the first set-back, very often without taking care to load up their own fighters and surrendering dozens of versts to the enemy, whether the latter advanced or not ... these units, I told him, inspired no confidence in the peasants who realized that, being isolated in their villages and unarmed, they were the ones at the mercy of the Revolu tion's foes. Indeed, the Red Guards' armored trains never sent detachments out into the villages located within a ten or twenty kilometer radius, not merely to issue them with weapons but also to stimulate the peasants and urge them into mounting daring strikes against the Revolution's enemies by taking a hand in the action themselv es. Sverdlov heard me out attentively and from time to time exclaimed: Can that be possible? I named several units of Red Guards attached to the groups of Bogdanov, Svirski or Sablin and others; very calmly, I pointed out that Red Guards charged with protecting the railroads for armored trains thanks to which they could switch rapidly on to the offensive, but more often beat a retreat, could scarcely inspire much confidence in the peasant masses. Now, those masses saw the Revolu tion as the means of getting rid of the oppression not just of the big la ndowners and rich kulaks but also of their hirelings and of escaping from the political and adminis trative power of the State official, and that consequently they were ready to defend themselves and their gains against summary executions and mass destruction, whether these emanated 504 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"from the Prussian Junkers3 or from the hetman [Skorop adsky's] troops. -Yes, said Sverdlov, I believe that you are right as far as the Red Guards are concerned ... but we have now reorganized them into a Red Army, which is building up its strength and if the peasants in the South are, as you describe, driven by such revolutionary commitment, there is every chance of the Germans' being flattened and the hetman 's biting the dust shortly-in which case, soviet power will triumph in the Ukraine also. -That will depend upon the clandestine action carried out in the Ukraine. For my own part, I reckon that such action is more necessary today than ever, provided that it be organized and whipped into fighting shape, which would inspire the masses to open revolt in town and countryside against the Germans and the hetman. In the absence of an essentially revolutionary uprising inside the Ukraine, the Germans and Austrians will not be forced to evacuate and we will not be able to get our hands on the hetman and those supporting him or to force them to flee with their protectors. Do not forget that on account of the Brest-Litovsk treaty and international political factors with which our Revolution has to contend, a Red Army offensive is out of the question . While I was putting this to him, Comrade Sverdlo v was making notes. -As it happens, he told me, I am entirely of the same view as yourself . But what are you, a Communist or a Left4 Social Revolutionar y? It is plain from the way you talk that you are Ukrainian, but it is unclear to which of those two parties you belong. While it did not bother me (the CEC secretary having put it to me already) that question did place me in a bit of a quandary. What was I to do? Tell Sverdlov bluntly that I was an anarcho-communist, the comrade and friend of those whom his party and the State system created by it had crushed in Moscow and several other cities just two months previousl y, or should I fly some other flag of convenience? I was of two minds and Sverdlov noticed it. I was loath to spell out my conception of the social revolution and my political affiliation in the middle of our intervie w. But I also found it repugnant to conceal them. That is why, after a few moments' deliberation, I told Sverdlov: -Why so much interest in my political affiliation? Are my papers which show you who I am, whence I come and the part I have pla yed in a certain region in the organizing of the toilers of town and country as well as parti­ san bands and volunteer battalions to fight the counter-revolution which has fastened on the Ukraine, not enough for you?

I told the CEC chairman: -Anarchism is too realistic an ideal not to understand the modern world and current events, and the part that its exponents pla y in one way or another in those events is there to be seen, and not to pay attention to the guidelines by which its action must be governed and the means that have to be used to that end ... -Glad to hear it, but you are not at all like these anarchists who, here in Moscow, had set up their headquarters in Malaia Dmitrovka, Sverdlov told me, and he was about to add something else, but I interjected: -Your Party's crushing of the Malaia Dmitrovka anarchists5 must be regarded as a painful episode of which, for the sake of the Revolu tion, there must be no repetition in the future ...

The latter welcomed me like a brother. He took me by the arm, and tapping my shoulder lightly with his other hand, had me sit in an easy chair. Having invited Sverdlov to settle into another armchair, he went over to his secretary and told him. -Be so kind as to finish that job by two o'clock. Whereupon he sat facing me and began to question me. His first question was: What region do you come from? Then: How have the peasants of the area taken to the watchword A LL POWER TO THE SOVIETS IN THE VILLAGES and what has the reaction been from the enemies of that watchw ord, and the Central Rada's reaction in particu lar? Then: Have the peasants of your area risen up against the Austro -German invaders? If so, what prevented the peasant revolts from turning into a general uprising and linking up with the actions of the Red Guard units which have so courageo usly been defending our revolutionary gains? I gave Lenin brief answers to all of these questions. With that talent that was all his own, he strove to put the questions in such a way that I could answer them point by point. Take, for instance, the question: How have the peasants of the area taken to the watchword ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS IN THE VILLAGES? Lenin put it to me three times, and was astonished at my reply: The peasants have welcomed it after their fashion, which is to say that, as they understand it, all power should, in every sphere, mirror the consciousness and wishes of the toilers; that the soviets of worker-p easant deputie s, at village , cantonal or district levels are nothing more nor less than offshoots of the revolut ionary organization and economic self-management of the toilers struggling against the bourgeoisie and its lackeys, the Right Social Revolutionaries and their coalition government. -Do you think that that is a proper construction to place upon our watchword? asked Lenin. -Yes, I replied. -In that case, the peasants of your region have been infected with anar- chism, he told me. -Is that such a bad thing? I asked. -That is not what I mean. On the contrar y, it is to be ce lebrated for it would hasten communism 's victory over capitalism and its power. -I find that flattering, I told Lenin, straining not to laugh .

I am even inclined to believe that this mentali ty, cornered by the trium phant counter-revolution before it had the time to spawn an organization, has already perished . I poin ted out to Lenin that a political leader ought never to display pes­ simism or skepticism. -So, according to you, Sverdlov interrupted, these anarchist tendencies in the life of the peasant masses ought to be given encouragement? -Oh, your party is not going to encourage them, I replied. Whereupon Lenin interjected: -And why should we encourage them? In order to divide the proletariat's revolutionary forces, clear a path for the counter-revolution and, when all is said and done, mount the scaffold ourselves along with the proletariat? I could scarcely contain myself, and with my voice betraying my irrita­ tion, I pointed out to Lenin that anarchism and anarchists did not aspire to counter -revolution and would not lead the proletariat there. -Did I really say that? Lenin asked me, and he added: I meant to say that anarchists, lacking mass organizations, are not in a position to organize the proletariat and the poor peasants and, as a result, incite them to def end, in the broadest sense of the term, what has been won by us all and which we hold dear.\" The conversation then turned to other matters raised by Lenin. To one query, regarding \"The Red Guard units and the revolutionary courage with which they defended our common gains\" Lenin forced me to give as complete an answer as possible. Plainly, the question bothered him or else reminded him of what the Red Guard units had recently accomplished in the Ukraine in achieving, so they claimed, the objectives which Lenin and his party had set themselves and in the name of which they had despatched them from Petro grad and other far-off great cities in Russia. I rememb er Lenin's emo­ tion, the emotion that could only be displayed by a man who passionate ly lived the struggle against the social order which he despised and wanted to see beaten, when I told him: -Having been involved in the disarming of dozens of Cossacks withdra wn from the German front at the end of December 1917 and the start of1918, I 508 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"am well-informed about the 'revolutionary bravado' of Red Army units and especially their command ers. Now it strikes me, Comrade Lenin, that, taking second- and third-hand intelligence as your basis, you are exaggerating it. -How so? Are you questioning it? Lenin asked. -The Red Guard units have displayed revolutionary spirit and courage, but not to the extent you describe. The Red Guards' struggle against the Central Rada's 'haidamaks'6 and above all against the German troops have seen times when revolut ionary spirit and bravery, as well as the Red Guards' and their commanders' actions, have proved very flimsy. To be sure, in many instances, there are, as I see it, grounds for putting this down to the fact that the Red Guard detachments had been hastily put together and employed against the enemy tactics that resembled neither the tactics of partisan bands nor those of regulars . You must know that the Red Guards, whatever their numerical strength, mounted their attacks upon the enemy by traveling along the rail­ roads. Some ten or fifteen versts from the rails, the terrain was unoccupied: defenders of the revolution or of the counter-revolution could have circulated there at will. For that reason, surprise attacks almost always succeeded. It is only around railway halts, towns or hamlets served by the railways that the Red Guard formations organized a front and launched their attacks. But the rear and the immediate environs of the places under enemy threat were left undefended. The revolut ion's offensive action suffered counter­ thrusts as a result. Red Guard units had scarcely finished issuing their appeals in a region before the counter-revolutionary forces went on to the counter­ offensive and very often forced the Red Guards to beat the retreat, scrambling aboard their armored trains. So much so that the rural population never even saw them and conseq uently could scarcely support them. -What are revolutionary propagandists doing in the countryside? Can they not even manage to keep the rural proletariat on stan d-by to act as fresh troops to replenish Red Guard units passing through the neighbor hood, or to form new Red Guard irregulars and occupy positions for the purposes of combating the counter-revolution? Lenin asked. -Let's not get carried away. There are very few revolutionary propa­ gandists in the countryside and there is not much that they can do. Now, every passing day brings hundreds of propagandists and secret enemies of the Revolution into the villages. In many places, we should not be waiting for revolutionary propagandists to conjure up fresh forces for the revolution and organize them to confront the counter-revolution.

Failure to take that into account, especially where we in the Ukraine arc concerned, amounts to letting the counter -revolution marshaled behind the hetman expand at will and consolidate its power. Sverdlov's eyes darted from me to Lenin and back again and he smiled with satisfaction. As for Lenin, his fingers were intertwined and he was deep in thought, his head tilted to one side. Having taken it all in, he said to me: -Every thing that you have just told me is greatly to be regretted. And, turning towards Sverdlov, he added: We are on the right track in reorganiz­ ing the Red Guard units into the Red Army, the track that leads on to the proletariat's definitive victory over the bourgeoisie. -Yes, yes, Sverdlov responded with animation. Whereupon Lenin said to me: -What work have you in mind to do here in Moscow? My answer was that I would not be staying long. As agreed by the Confer­ ence of partisan groups held in Taganrog, I was due to return to the Ukraine early in July. -Clandestine ly) Lenin asked. -Yes, I replied. Turning then to Sverdlov, Lenin mused: -Anarchists are always full of the spirit of sacrifice, ready to face any sacrifice, but being blind fanatics, they ignore the past and have their thoughts fixed exclusively upon the distant future. And, beggi ng me not to take that as applicable to me, he went on: -You, comrade, I regard as a man with a feeling for the realities and re­ quirements of our times. If only a third of the anarchists in Russia were like you, we Communists would be ready to work with them under certain condi­ tions and work in concert in the interests offree organization of the producers . Right then, I felt a deep regard for Lenin develop within me, although until recently I had held him responsible for the elimination of Moscow's anarchist organizations, which had been the signal for the crushing of them in lots of other cities. And in my heart of hearts, I was ashamed of myself. Search ing for what answer I should make to Lenin, I let him have it point-blank: -The Revolution and its gains are dear to anarchist-comm unists: and that is proof that on that count they are all alike. -Oh, come off it! Lenin returned with a laugh. We know the anarchists as well as you do. For the most part, they have no idea of the here-and-now, 510 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"or at any rate, care very little about it; now the present is so serious that not thinking about it or not adopting some positi ve stance with regard to it is more than shameful in a revolutionary. Most anarchists have their minds focused on the future and devote their writings to that, without making any attempt to understand the here-and-now : and that is another thing that sets us apart from them. At which Lenin rose from his easy chair and pacing back and forth, added: -Yes, yes, anarchists are big on ideas for the future, but in the here-and­ now, their feet never touch the ground; theirs is a deplorable attitude, because their vacuous fanaticism ensures that they have no real links to that future. Sverdlov smirked, and, turning in my direction, said: -You cannot challenge that. Vladimir Ilitch's reasoning is spot -on. Lenin hurriedly added: -Have anarchists ever acknowle dged their lack of realism in the 'here­ and-now' oflife? It doesn't even occur to them. In reply to that, I told Lenin and Sverdlov that I was a semi-literate peasant and would not get into a discussion of the, to me, overly erudite, view which Lenin had just expressed regarding anarchists. -But I ought to tell you, Comrade Lenin, that your assertion, to wit, that anarchists have no grasp of the 'here-and-now' and have no real ties to it, et cetera, is wrong through and through. The anarchist-communists of the Ukraine, (or \"Southern Russia,\" since you Bolshevik-Communists try to steer clear of the word Ukrain e)-as I say, the anarchist- communists -have already furnished proof aplenty that they stand four-square in the 'here­ and-now.' The entire struggle of the Ukrainian revolutionary countryside against the Central Rada has been conducted under the ideological direction of anarchist-comm unists and, partly, of the Social Revolut ionaries (who, to be honest, ascribe to their fight against the Rada quite different objectives than we anarchist-communists do). Your Bolsheviks are, so to speak, non­ existent in our countryside; where any do exist, their influence is minuscule. Nearly all of the peasant communes or associations in the Ukraine have been launched at the instigation of anarchist-comm unists. And the laboring population's armed struggle with the counter-revolu tion general ly, as well as with the counter-revolu tion embodied in the Austro-Hungarian and Ger­ man armies of invasion, has been undertak en under the exclusi ve ideological and organizational aegis of anarchi st-communists.

THE FIRST \"FREE COM MUNE S\" [In the southern Ukraine, following the expulsion of the great landowners ] the land came into peasant hands. The latter were well aware that it was not all over yet, that it was not enough to seize a tract ofland and leave it at that. Life, a tough teacher, had taught them that there were enemies lurking everywhere and had taught them to stick together. In a number of places, attempts were made to reorganize life along communal lines. In spite of the peasants' hostility towards the official (governme nt) communes, in many places throughout the Gulyai-Polye region there sprang up peasant communes known as \"labor communes\" or \"free commun es.\" Thus the township of Pokrovsk oye saw the formation of the very first free commune, called after Rosa Luxemburg. Its members were all unemployed. To begin with, this com­ mune comprised only a few dozen members; later, their numbers expanded to over three hundred. ( ... ) With a straightforward ness and expansiveness of the soul character­ istic of the people, the peasants had honored the memory of a heroine of the Revolution, a stranger to them, who had perished as a martyr in the revo­ lutionary struggle. Now, the commune's internal arrangements were based upon the anti-au thoritarian principle. As it developed and grew, it began to exercise great influence over the peasants of the entire district. The \"com­ munist\" authorities attempted to meddle in the commune's internal affairs, but were rebuffed. ( ... ) Another commune which brought together the poor peasants of Gulyai-Pol ye was launched on an old estate seven kilometers outside Gulyai­ Polye. It was simply called \"Commune No. 1 of the peasants ofGulyai-Polye .\" Communes No. 2 and No. 3 lay around twenty kilometers from there. And there were further communes elsewhere . True, taken all in all, the communes were not numerous and encompassed only a minority of the population: par- NESTOR MAKH NO 515"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"ticular ly the ones who had no solidly estab lished arable holdings. But these communes had been formed on the initiati ve of the poor peasa nts themselve s. The Makh novists' work only influenced them to the extent that the latter were pushing the idea of free communes in the region. The communes were launch ed, not as the result of some dream or exam ple, but quite simply to meet the essential needs of the peasants who had had noth­ ing prior to the revolu tion and, having achie ved victory, set about organizing their econ omic activity along communal lines. These were not the contrived communes of the Communist Party which usually included people rounded up haphazar dly who did nothing except waste the grain and ruin the ground, who enjoyed support from the State and the government and thus lived off the labors of the people whom they presumed to teach how to work. These were genuine working comm unes of peasants accustomed to work since childhood and capable of appre ciating the labors of others as well as their own. To begin with, the peasants worked there in order to secure their daily bread. In additi on, every individual received there all the moral and material backing he could need. The princi ple of fraternity and equality was staunchl y upheld in the comm unes. Every one, man, woman or child, was expected to work there , insof ar as they were able. Or ganizational tasks were entrusted to one or two comrades who, once those tasks had been dealt with, returned to their normal work alongside all the other memb ers of the comm une. Obviousl y, such healthy, responsible practices were due to the comm unes' having emerged in a working context and their growth having proceeded along natural lines. However, these seeds of free comm unism fe ll fa r short of accounting fo r the whole of the peasants' creative , constructi ve, economic and social activi­ ties.

It was essential that a united organization be arrived at, not just within the confines of such and such a hamlet or village, but also in whole districts or even departments (governments ) making up the liberated region. There was a need to work together to resolve the various questions confronting the region as a whole. Appropriate bodies had to be created, and the peasants did not fa il to do so. These bodies were the regional congresses of peasants , workers and partisa ns. During the region' s period offreedom, three such congr esses were held.

Contrary to the Bolshe­ viks' and other socialists' political soviets, the frec soviets of the peasants and workers were to have been the organs of their social and economic \"self­ gove rnance.\" The individual soviet was only the executor of the wishes of the distric t's toilers and of their organiza tions . The local soviets established the requisite liaison with one another, thereby forming larger-scale economic and territorial bodies . However, the context of war made the creation and operation of these bodies extre mely difficult, and fo r that reason, complete organization of them was never successf ully carried through. MAKHNO 'S INSUR GENT ARMY INCORPORATED INTO THE RED ARMY (EARL Y 1919) At the beginning of 1919, after a series of skirmish es, the Makh novist insur­ gents drove Denikin 's troops back in the direction of the Sea of Azov and captured around one hundred wagon-loads of wheat from them . The first thought of Makhno and the staff of the insur gent army was to despatch these captured provisions to the famished workers of Mosco w and Petrogr ad. That suggestion was enthusiastic ally endorsed by the broad masses of the insur gents . The hundred wagon-loads of wheat were delivered to Petro grad and Moscow, under escort from a Makhn ovist delegation that was very warmly received by the Mosco w Soviet. The Bolsheviks arrived in the region of the MAKHNOVSHCHINA long after Denikin. The Makh novist insur gents had, by then, been locked in battle with him fo r a good three month s; they had by then driven him out of their region and established their line of defense east ofMariupol, by the time that the first Bolshevik division, headed by Dybenko,! arrived in Sinelnik ovo. Makhno persona lly, and the entire insur gent revolut ionary moveme nt, were still unkn own quantities as fa r as the Bolsheviks were concerned. In the Communist press in Mosco w and in the provinces, Makhno had hitherto been mentioned as a daring insurgent of great promise. His strugg le against Skoropadsky, and then against Petliura and Denikin assured him in advance of the goodwill of the Uolshevik chief s. To them, there seemed to be no doubt but that the Makh novists' revol utionary detachments which resisted so many varieties of counter -revol ution in the Ukraine, would be absor bed into the Red Army. So they arrived singing Mak hno's praises, without first having NESTOR MAKHNO 517"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"acquainted themse lves with him on his home turf, and whole columns of their newspapers were devoted to him. The Bolshevik fighters' first encou nter with Makhno took place under the same auspices of goodwill and praise (in March 1919). Makhno was immedi ately invited to join the Red Arm y along with all his detachm ents, with an eye to joining fo rces in order to defeat Denikin. The political and ideological idiosyncrasies of the revolutionary insur gency were regarded as quite natur al and in no way potential obstacles to amalg amation on the basis of comm on cause. Those idiosyncrasies were to be left intac t. As we shall see anon, the leaders of the MAK HNOVSHCH INA had been mistaken in their hopes that the Bolsheviks would be ideological adversaries only. They had failed to take into consideration that they were dealing here with the most accom plished of statists and exponents of authoritarian violence. Errors, unless dang er ensues, can have their uses. Theirs proved a good lesson for the Makhnovists. The insur gent army became a component part of the Red Army under the following conditions: a) the insurgent arm y is to retain its fo rmer internal order. b) it is to have seconded to it political commissa rs appoi nted by the Com­ munist author ities. c) it is to be subordi nated to the Red high command only in relation to militar y operations proper. d) it is not to be removed from the Denikin front. e) It is to obtain munitions and provisions on the same fo oting as the Red Army. f) it is to retain its title as the Insurgent Revol utionary Army and keep its black flags. The Makhno vist insur gents' army was organized in accordance with three underlying principles: volunteer service, the electi ve princi ple and self-disci pline. Volu nteer service meant that the army comprised solely revolu tionary combatants enlisting of their own volition. The electi ve principle consisted of the fact that the command ers of every part of the army, memb ers of the staff and council as well as all persons holding positions of importance generall y in the army, had to be elected or endorsed by the insurgents of those respec tive parts or by the army as a whole. 518 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Self-disci pline meant that all of the army's disciplinary rules were draw n up by commissions of insurgents, then endorsed by the general assemblies of the parts of the army, and were stringe ntly observed, on the respon sibility of each insurgent and each commander.

REPL Y TO DYBENKO (APR IL 1919) \"Comrade\" Dybenk ol declared the congress scheduled for Gulyai-Polye on April 10, 1919 counter -revol utionary and outla wed its organizers, against whom, he claims, the severest repress ive measures must be enforced.

Prior to declaring the congress counter-revo lution ary, \"comrade\" Dybenko did not even take the trouble to inquire in what name and fo r what purpose this congress was convened by the \"disban ded\" military revolu tionary staff of Gulyai-Pol ye, whereas in point of fact, it had been summoned by the executive committee of the military revol utionary committee. So the latter , having summoned the congr ess, cannot tell whether it is it which \"com rade\" Dybenko regards as being outside of the law. If such be the case, allow us to inform Your Excellency by whom and to what end that (in your view, manif estly counter-revol utionar y) congress NESTOR MAKH NO 519"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"was convened, and then, it may, perhaps, no longer appear as frightening as you portr ay it. The congr ess, as said, was summ oned by the executive committee of the military revol utionary council of the Gulyai-P olye region, in Gulyai-Pol ye itself (it being the centrally situated town) . It was designated as the third Gulyai- Polye regional congr ess. It was summoned fo r the purpose of deter ­ mining the future policy line of the military revolu tionary council. (You see, \"comrade\" Dyben ko, three of these \"coun ter-revol utionary\" congresses have taken place alread y.) But the question arises: what is the proven ance of the regional military revolu tionary committee itself and for what purpose was it fo unded? If you still do not know the an swer, \"comrade \" Dybenko, let us enlighten you. The regional military revolut ionary council was set up in accordance with the resolution from the second congress held in Gulyai-Polye on February 12th this year. (A long time ago, as you can see, long before you ever got here.) The regional military revolutionary council was formed, then, to organize combatants and oversee voluntary mobilization, fo r the region was encir cled by the Whites, and the insur gent detachments made up of the first volunteers were no longer sufficient to hold an extended front. At that time, there were no soviet troops in our region; and then again. the popula tion expected no great help, its view being that it was up to itself to look to the def ense of its region. To that end, the Gulyai-Polye regional military revolu tionary council was set up; that council compri sed, according to the second congress's resolu­ tion, one delegate per distric t, thirty-two members in all, representing the districts of the Ekaterino slav and Tauride govern ments. But we will go into the military revolu tionary council later. Here the question arises: where did that second regional cong ress come from' who convened it? who authorized it? was the convener an outla w, and if not, then why not? The second regional cong ress was summ oned to Gulyai-P olye by a steering com mittee made up of five individuals elected by the first congr ess. The second congress took place on February 12 this year and, to our great astonishment, its conveners were not outla\\v ed, fo r at the time there were none of those \"heroes\" who would dare trespass against the people's rights, won with the people's own blood. A fu rther question theref ore arises: where had the first congress come from? who had convened it? was its convener not outla wed, and if not, why not? \"Comrade\" Dybenko, you are, it seems, still very new to the revol utionary movement in the Ukraine and we must educate 520 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"you as to its very beginni ngs. Which is what we are about to do; and you, once you have been educated about it, will perhaps mend your ways a little. The first regional congress took place on January 23 this year in the fIrst insurgent camp in Greater Mikha ilovka. It consisted of delegates from the districts adjacent to the front. Soviet troops were then a long way away, a very long way away. The region was cut off from the whole world: on one side by the Denikinists, on the other by the Petliurists; conse quentl y, there were only the insur gent detachments with Father Makhno and Shchuss at their head to match these others blow for blow. The organizers and social institutions in the towns and villages in those days did not always go by the same names. In such and such a town, there might be a \"soviet,\" somewhere else a \"people's regency ,\" in a third place a \"military revolutionary staff,\" in a fo urth a \"provincial regency ,\" etc., but the ethos was equall y revol utionary throughout. In order to consolidate the front as well as to introduce a degree of unifo rmity of organization and action across the regio n, the first congress was summoned. No one had convened it; it had come together spontaneou sly, in accor­ dance with the popula tion's wishes and with its approva l. At the congress it was proposed that those of our brothers who had been forcibly enlisted in the Petliurist army be snatched back. To that end, a five-man delegation was elected and instructed to call to Father Makh no's headquarters and whiche ver others might be necess ary, and to infiltrate even the army of the Ukrainian Directory (known as Petliura's army) in order to proclaim to our conscr ipted brethren that they had been misled and must quit that army. In additio n, the delegation was charged with summoning, upon its return , a 1110re comprehen sive second congr ess, with a view to organizing the entire region delivered from the count er-revolu tionary bands and creating a more powerful defense front. So, upon returning, the delegates did summ on that second regio nal congr ess, outside of any \"party,\" \"authorities\" or \"law\"; fo r you, \"comrade\" Dybenko, and other lovers and guardians of the law of the same ilk as yourself were away far away : and since the heroic leaders of the insur gent move ment did not aspire to power over the people who had just, with their very own hands , torn asunder the shackles of slavery, the congress was not declared counter-rev olutionar y, and its conveners were not outla wed. To return to the regional council: Even as the Gulyai-Polye regional military revol utionar y council was being fo rmed, the soviet authorities ar- NESTOR MAKH NO 521"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"rived in the region . In accordance with the resolution passed at the second congr ess, the regional congress did not leave matte rs in abeyance pending the arrival of the soviet authori ties. It had a duty to implement the instruct ions from congress, unswerving ly. The council was not a directing agency but merely an executi ve one. It carried on doing what it could and continued its efforts along revol utionary lines. Little by little, the soviet authorities began to place obstacles in the way of the council 's activi ties; commissar s and other high-r anking official s of the soviet government began to look upon the council as a counter -revolut ionary organization. At which point the council members decided to summon the third regional congress fo r April 10 in Gulyai-Polye , in order to determine the counci l's fu ture policy line or indeed to wind it up, should congress so decide. And 10 and behold, the congress went ahead. Those who attended were not counter-r evolutionarie s, but rather the people who had been the very first to raise the flag of insurrection in the Ukraine, the flag of social revolut ion. They had come in order to assist in the coordination of the overall struggle against all oppressors. Representa­ tives from 72 cantons spread over various districts and govern ments, as well as several military units showed up fo r the congr ess, and they all fo und that the Gulyai-Polye regional military revol utionary council was needed; indeed, they expanded its execu tive committee and enjoined the latter to carry out egalitarian mobilization of volunteers in the region. The congress was well and truly stunned by \"comrade\" Dyben ko's telegram pronou ncing the con­ gress \"counte r-revolu tionary,\" when that region had led the way in raising the banner of insurrec tion. Which is why the congress passed a vigorous protest against that telegram . Such is the pictur e that should come as an eye-opener to you, \"comrade\" Dybenko. Catch yourself on! Think! Do you, on your own, have any right to declar e counter -revolu tionary a popu lation of one million toilers who, with their very own horny hands, have cast off the shackles of slavery and are now rebuilding their lives as they deem fit? No! If you are truly revolu tiona ry, you must rally to their aid in the struggle against the oppressors and in their endea vors to build a new, free life. Can it be tha t there are laws made by a handf ul of individuals purp ort­ ing to be revol utionaries, entitling them to place the most revol utionary of peoples, in its entirety, outside of the law?

It was Trotsky, who had in the meantime arrived in the Ukraine, who set the tone for this campaign; according to him, the insurgent movement was nothing but a movement of well-to -do fa rmers (\"kulaks\") bent upon conso li­ dating their power in the area. All of the Makhnovist and anarchist prattle about the libertarian toilers' commu ne was merely a tactical ploy, where as in reality the Makhn ovists and anarchists were bent on establishing their own anarchist authori ty, which, when all was said and done , added up to that of the wealthy kulaks.

Simul taneou sly with this campaign of deliber ately misinf orma tive agita­ tion, the surve illance, or rather blockade, maintained on the insur gent terri­ tories was taken to extreme s. Revol utionary workers drawn to that proud and independ ent region by their symp athies from far-flung regions in Russia, from Mosco w, Petrogr ad, Ivanovo- Voznessensk, the Volga, the Urals and Siberia had to confront the greatest difficulties before they could arrive there .

Did the Bolsheviks realize what they were doing and understand the implications of their policy fo r the already very complex situation in the Ukraine? Certainl y. They were perfectly well aware of what they were doing. They had resorted to blockade tactics with an eye to destro ying and eradicating the region's military might.

MAKH NO OFFER S TO TAKE A BACK SEAT (JUNE 6-9, 1919) Makhno informed his staff and the council that the Bolsheviks had left the front in the Grishino sector unmanned and were thereby offering Denikin 's troops unhin dered access to the Gulyai-P olye region via the north-east flank. And in fa ct, the Cossack hordes burst into the region, not where they faced the insur gents' front but on the left flank where the Red Army troops were stationed. As a result, the Makh novist army manning the front in the Mariu pol-Kuteyni kovo -T aganrog area fo und itself outflank ed by Deniki n's troops. The latter flooded through in huge numbers into the very heart of the region. ( ... ) The peasants throughout the region had so expected an all-out at­ tack by Denikin that they had made preparations fo r it and had resolved to raise a levy of volunteer troops in reply. Ever since April, peasants in a host of villages had been despatch ing fresh fighters to Gulyai-P olye. But arms and munitions were in short supply. Even older units serving on the front had no munitions left and of ten mounted attacks on the Whites fo r the sole purpose of procuring some. The Bolsheviks who, under the agreement concluded, had undertaken to keep the insur gents supplied III ilitaril y, had begun their sabotage and blockade policy back in April. For which reason it was not pos­ sible to train fresh troops in spite of the influx of volunteer recruits, and the outcome of this could be predicted. In just one day, the Gulyai-Polye peasants raised a regim ent in an effort to save their village. To which end they had to arm thems elves with primi­ tive tools: axes, picks, ancient carbines, hunting pieces, etc. They set out on a 530 NESTOR MAKH NO"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"march to meet the Cossacks, in an attempt to halt their progr ess. Around 15 kilometers outside ofGulyai-P olye, near the village ofSviatodukhov ka, they clashed with significan t numbers of Cossa cks from the Don and Kuban. They engaged them in bitter, heroic , murderous fighting, during which they almost all perished, along with their commander, B. Veretelnikoff, a native ofGul yai­ Polye who was a worker from the Putilov plant in Petrograd . Whereupon a veritable avalanche of Cossacks descended upon Gulyai-P olye, occupying it on June 6, 1919. Makhno and the army staff, having only one batte ry, retreated as fa r as the Gulyai-Polye railroad station, around seven kilometers from the village: but, towards evening, he fo und himse lf obliged to quit the station too. Having marshaled whatever forces he still could, Makhno successf ully mounted a counter-attack against Gulyai-Po lye the next day and managed to dislodge the enem y. But he held the village for only a very short time: a fresh onslaught of Cossa cks compelled him to abandon it once again. It should be noted that the Bolshevi ks, even thoug h they had already issued several orders targeting the Makh novis ts, carried on, right from the start, to look well upon them, as if nothing was wrong. This ploy was calculated to win over the movement' s leaders for sure. On June 7, they sent Makhno an armored trai n, urging him to hold out to the bitter end and prom ising that further reinf orcements would follow. In fact, a few Red army detach ments arrived two days later at the Gaitchur railway station in the Chaplino sector, about twenty kilometers from Gulyai-Polye; with them came the arm y com­ missars Mezhla uk, Voroshi lov and others. Contact was established between the Red Army and insur gent commands: a sort of joint staff over both camps was fo rmed. Mezhlauk and Voroshi lov rubb ed shoulders with Makhno in the same armored train, and they directed military operations together. But at the same time, Voro shilov had with him an order signed by Trotsky, instructing him to seize Makhno and all other ranking leaders of the MAKH­ NOVSHCHINA, disarm insur gent troops and mercilessly mow down any who might attempt resistance. Voroshilov was just waiting for the right moment to carry out that mission. Makhno was alerted in time and realized what he had to do. He summed up the situation as it stood, and saw the bloody events that might erupt any day and cast around for a satisfactory resolution . He reckoned that the best thing would be fo r him to quit his post as commander of the insurgent front.

THE REGIONAL PEASANTS' AND WORKERS' CONGRE SS (OCTOBER 1919) A regional peasan ts' and workers' congress was held in Alexand rovsk on October 20, 1919. Upwards of two hundred delegates took part, 180 of them peasan ts and two or three dozen workers. The congress examined both issues of a military nature (the fight against Denikin. expansion of the insur gent army and its supply lines) and other business relating to the elements of civilian Ii fe . The congress proceeding s lasted fo r more than a week and were marked by a quite extraordi nary vigor on the part of participants .

The idea of free soviets working in concert with the \\vishes of the toiling popula­ tion locally; the relations between the peasants and the urban work ers, based upon mutual exchanges of the products of their labors: the idea of organ iz­ ing life along egalitarian and libertarian lines, all these theses, which Voline expounded in his reports, reflected the thinking of the peasant popula tion which could not imagine the Revolution and creati ve revol utionary endeavor in any different shape or fo rm.

It is presently bringing to a successf ul conclusion the fight against Denik in's army, liberating region after region, where soever tyrann y and oppre ssion existed. Many peasant toilers have asked themse lves the question : what to do? What can and what ought we to do?

WHO AHE THE \"MAKHNOVITSI\" AND FOR WHICH CAUS!: DU THEY fiGHT? The MAKHNOVITSI are peasants and workers who rose up as long ago as 1918 against the brutal ity of the bourgeois, German, Hungarian and Austrian authorities and against that of the hetman of the Ukraine . The MAKHNOVITSI are toilers who have unfurled the banner of struggle against Denikin and against any fo rm of oppre ssion, violence and falsehood, whatever its provenance. The MAKHNOVITSI are those same toilers who, through their life-long labors, have enriched and fattened the bour geoisie in general and, today, the soviets in particular. 2. WHY ARE THEY CALLED \"MAKHNOVITSI \"? Because, during the darkest and gravest moments of the reaction in the Ukraine, our ranks included our indef atigable friend and CONDOTTIE RE,2 Makhno, whose voice rang out across the whole of the Ukraine, in protest at every act of violence against the toilers, summoning them all to the strug gle against the oppre ssors, robbers, usurpers and political charlatans who deceive the toilers . To this very day, that voice rings out among us, within our ranks , unchanging in its exhortation to strug gle for the ultimate goal of the liberation and emanci pation of toilers from each and every oppression . 3. How DO YOU INTEND TO BHING THAT LIBERATION ABOUT? By overthro wing the monarchist coalition government, the republi can, social democratic governm ent, the Bolshevik -Communist government. In their place, through free elections , toilers' councils must be elected and these will not const itute a government, complete with written, arbitrary laws. For the soviet arrangement is not autho ritarian (unlike the Social Democr ats and Bolshevik Communists who purport to be the soviet authorit ies today). It is the purest fo rm of anti-authori tarian, anti-State socialism, articulated through free organization of the social life of toilers , independent of authorit ies: a life where every worker, alone or in assoc iation, can quite independen tly pursue his own happiness and his own complete well-b eing, in accord3l1ce with the precepts of solidar ity, amity and equali ty.

Ida Mett, who wrote a book on The Kronstadt U p rising (1938, reprinted 1948) acknow ledges that the anarchist influence in it was discer nible \"only to the extent that anarchism too was pushing the idea of a workers' democracy.\" However, the Kronstadt Revol utionary Committee had invited two anarchists to join its ranks: Efim Yartchu k, who later wrote KrollStadt, and Voline, who devo ted a substantial segment of his The Unknown Revolution to Kronstadt \"the first wholl y independent popular essay ( . .. ) at social revol ution ( . . . ) mounted di­ rectly by the laboring classes thems elves.\" But neither Yartchuk nor Voline was able to take up the Kronstadt Revol utionary Committee' s invitation, in that they were both held in Bolshevik prisons at the time.

Our purpose, of course, is certainl y not to join with them as they mock Lenin and Trotsky, nor to reiterate on our own account the insul ts and sarcastic remarks they shower upon that pair. It is all too obvious that anger pushed the revolt's language over the edge and rendered it, in part, unfair. The accumulated errors of the Bolshevik authorities between 1918 and 1921, of which Kronstadt was to be the culmination, in no way diminished the revol utionary convictions or genius of the authors of the October Revolu­ tion. But how could these sailors and worke rs-once the grassro ots archit ects of the mass uprising of 1917-who were about to perish under the gunfir e of the Red officer cadets and Mongolian troops have retained the historian' s objectivity and sung the praises of their executioners? Contrary to the impr ession that might be obtained from a reading of the revolt's daily newspaper Izvestia, the crushing of the Kronstadt revolt was not the result of perverse and malignant intent on the part of Lenin and Trotsky, but rather the outcome of a conspiracy oHate attended by implacable objective circumstances (like civil war, economic disarr ay, EUlline) and daring human miscalcula tions (the harshness of an autocratic regime increasingly isolated from the popular forces which had hoisted it into power ). Viewed thus, the lesson of Kronstadt turns out to be a caution ary note and forewarning fo r all advocates of revolu tion from above who might be inclined not to heed it and who, in the proletariat's name, might finish up, paradoxically, turning their guns on the proletariat.

The cause lay in the increased suffering caused by an exceptionall y severe winter, and in the soviets' habitual shortsigh tedness. Terrible blizza rds had delayed the delivery of fo od and fu el supplies to the city. In addition, the Petro-So viet had made the stupid mistake of shutting dO\\vn several fa ctories and halving their workforce's rations.

The strike spread, in spite of all their extreme measures. Arrests fo llowed, but the very stupidity with which the authorities reacted acted as a spur to the ignorant. Counte r-revolu tionary and anti- Semitic proclamations began to appear, as mad rumors of militar y repression and Cheka atrocities against the strikers swept the city.

The three against were Vassiliev, chair man of the Kronstadt soviet, who chaired the meeting, Kuzmin, commissar of the Baltic Fleet, and Kalinin, president of the fe derated soviet socialist republ ic. Two anarchists had been at the rally and returned to regale us with the order, enthusiasm and good mood which had prevailed at it. They had not witnessed such a spontaneous display of solidarity and fervent comradeship since the early days of October. They mere ly deplored the fact that we had missed this demonstration. The presence of Sasha, whom the Kronstadt sailors had staunchly defended when he was in danger of being extradited to Calif ornia in 1917, and myself, whom the sailors knew by reputation, would have added weight to the resolution, they said. We agreed with them that it would have been a marvelous experience to participate on soviet soil in the first great mass meeting not organized to order . Gorky had long ago assured me that the men of the Baltic Fleet were all born anarchists and that Illy place was with them. I had often wanted to go to Kronstadt to meet the crews and talk to them, but it was my belief that in my confused, befuddled state of mind of the time I had nothing constructi ve to of fer. Now I would go and take my place alongside them, knowing well that the Bolsheviks would peddle the rumor that I was inciting the sailors against the regime. Sasha said that he did not care much what the Communists might say. He would join the sailors in their protests on behalf of the striking workers of Petro grad. Our comrades labored the point that Kronstad t's express ions of sympath y with the strikers could not in any way be construed as anti-so viet activity . In fa ct, tbe sailors' frame of mind and the resolutions passed at their mass rally were markedly pro-soviet. They objected vigorousl y to the autocratic attitude shown towards the fa mished strikers , but the rally had contained not the slightest hint of opposition to the Comm unists. Indeed, that great meet ­ ing had taken place under the auspices of the Kronstadt Soviet. In token of their loyalty , the sailors had welcomed Kalinin with singing and music when he arrived in the town, and his address had been listened to attenti vely and with the utmost respect. Even after he and his colleagues had condemned the sailors and their motion, they had escorted Kalinin to the railway station with the utmost friendliness , as our informants were able to testif y. We had had wind of rumors that Kuzmin and Vassiliev had been arrested by the sailors at a meeting of three hundred delegates from the fleet, the garrison KRON STADT 549"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"and the trade union soviet. We asked our two comrades what they knew of this. They confirmed that the pair had indeed been placed under arrest. The reason was that Kuzmin had denounced the sailors and Petrograd strikers to the gathering as traitors, ( . .. ) declaring that hencef orth the Communist Party was going to tIght them to the bitter end as counter-revolu tionaries. The delegates had also learned that Kuzmin had issued orders that all provisions and munitions be removed from Krons tadt, thereby condemning the town to starve. On these grounds the Kronstadt sailors and garrison had decided to arrest the pair and to take precautions to ensure that the provisions \\vere not removed from the town. But no way was that an indication of any in­ tent to revolt, nor of the men of Kronstadt's having stopped believing in the revolutionary integrity of the Communists. On the contrary. They allovved Communist delegates to speak like the rest. Further proof of their contIdence in the regime was that a thirty-strong committee was sent fo r talks with the Petro-Soviet regarding an amicable settlement of the strike. We fe lt pride at this splendid solidarity on the part of the sailors and soldiers of Kronstadt with their striking brethren in Petro grad and we hoped fo r a speedy end to disturbances, thanks to the sailors' mediation. Alas! our hopes crumbled when news came an hour later of developments in Krons tadt. Petrograd was stunned by an order signed by Lenin and Tr otsky. The order said that Kronstadt had mutinied against the soviet government and denounced the sailors as \"the tools of former tsarist generals, who, by arrange ment with the Social Revolution ary traitors, had mounted a counter­ revolutionary conspiracy against the proletarian republic. \" \"Nonsense! Utter madness !\" Sasha shouted when he read a copy of that order. \"Lenin and Tr otsky must have been misinformed by someone. Even so. they cannot believe that the sailors are guilty of counter-revolutio n! What? The crews of the 'Petropavlo vsk' and 'Sebastopol: who had been the staunch­ est supporters of the Bolsheviks in October and ever since? Didn't Tr otsky himself salute them as 'the pride and glory of the Revolution' ?\" \"W e must go to Moscow right away,\" said Sasha. It was absolutely essential that we see Len in and Trotsky and explain to them that this was all a horr ible misunderstanding, a mistake that could prove fatal to the Revolution itself. It was very hard for Sasha to renounce his faith in the revolut ionary integrity of men who were, for millions across the globe, apostles of the proleta nat. I agreed with his belief that Lenin and Tr otsky had perhaps been misled by Zinoviev who telephoned every night with detailed reports from Kronstadt. 550 KRON STADT"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Even among his own comrad es, Zino viev had never had a reputation for personal courage. He had been seized by panic at the first sign of disco ntent on the part of the Petro grad worke rs. When he learned that the local garrison had indicated its sympa thy with the strikers, he lost his head complet ely and ordered that a machine-gun be set up in the Astoria Hotel for his personal protection. The Kronstadt business had filled him with terror and drove him to peddle nightmarish stories to Moscow. Sasha and I knew all that, but I could not believe that Lenin and Trotsky truly thought that the Kronst adters were guilty of count er-revol ution , or capable of colludi ng with White gener als, as Lenin 's order accused them of doing. An exceptional state of martial law was imposed throughout the entire province of Petrograd, and no one except officials with special passes could leave the city now. The Bolshevik press launched a campaign of calumn y and venom against Kronstadt, announcing that the sailors and soldiers had made common cause with the \"tsarist General Kozlovsky;\" they were thereby declar­ ing the Kronst adters outla ws. Sasha was beginning to realize that the roots of the situation went a lot deeper than simply Lenin and Trotsky acting upon bad information. The latter was to attend the special sitting of the Petro-Soviet at which the fate ofKronstadt was to be decided. We resolved to attend. This was the first time I had heard Trotsky in Russi a. I had thoug ht that I might remind him of his farewell words in New York;5 the hop e which he had expressed that we might soon meet in Russia to help out with the great tasks now possible fo llowing the overthrow of tsarism. We were going to ask him to let us he lp resolve the Kronstad t problems in a spirit of fratern ity, to offer our time and our en ergy, and even our lives, in this supreme test to which the revol ution was putting the Communist Party. Unfortun ately, Trotsky's train was late in arriving and failed to make the sitting. The men who addressed that assem bly were inaccess ible to reason or appeal. A demented fa naticism prom pted their words and a blind fe ar ruled their hearts. The platform was tightl y guarded by \"kursanty;\" bayonets fixed, Cheka troops stood betw een the platform and the audie nce. Zinoviev, who was in the chair , looked as ifhe was on the verge of a nervous breakdo wn. He stood up to speak several times, only to sit down again. When he eventua lly did start to speak, his head turned to right and left, as if fearing a surprise attack. His voice, weak as a child' s at the best of tim es, rose to an extremely disagreeable and unco nvincing shriek.

Not that that prevented Zinov iev, chairman of the special purpose-built defense committee, fr om announcing that Kronst adt had revolted against the revolution and was attempting to carry out the plans of Kozlovsky and his tsarist aids. Kalinin departed from his customary fa therly attitude and launched vio ­ lently into the sailors, fo rgetful of the homage paid to him in Kronstadt only a fe w days earlier. \"No measure can be too severe fo r counter-revolutionar­ ies who dare raise their hand against our glorious Revolutio n,\" he declared. Secondary speakers carried on in the same tone, stirring their Communist fa naticism, ignoring the true fa cts, and calling fo r a frenzied revenge on men who, until ver y recently, had been acclaimed as heroes and brothers. Above the din of the screaming, fo ot-stamping audience, a single voice strove to make itself heard: the strained and serious voice of a man fr om the fr ont rows. He was the delegate fr om the striking Naval dockyard workers. He was fo rced, he said, to register a protest at the fa lse accusations hurled fr om the platf orm against the courageous, loyal Kronstadters. Looking at Zinoviev and pointing him out, the fellow thundered: \"It is your cruel indif ference and your party' s which have driven us to strike and awakened the sympathy of our sailor brothers, who have struggled alongside us in the revolut ion . They are guilty of no other crime and you know that! You are deliberately misrepresenting them and calling fo r their extermination.\" Shouts of \"Counter-revolut ionary, trait or! Mens hev ik!

The elderly workman remained standing, his voice soaring above the tu­ mult: \"Barely three years ago, Lenin, Tr otsky, Zinoviev and all of you \\vere being denounced as traitors and German spies,\" he cried. \"W e workers and sailors came to your aid and rescued you fr om the Kerensky government.

And he began to read out the Kronstadt resolution passed at the mass meeting on March 1.\" The hubbub which erupted at this act of daring drowned his voice, except fo r those sitting close to him. But he stuck at it and carried on reading until the end. The sole reply to these two bold fellows, sons of the revolu tion, was the resolution moved by Zinoviev, demanding that Kronstadt surrender imllledi­ ately and unconditiona lly, or face extermina tion. It was rushed through, amid a pandemonium of confusion and opposing voices were shouted down. But this silence in the fa ce of the appro aching massacre was unbear able. I had to make myself heard. Not by these men possessed who would shout me down, as they had others . I would spell out my position that very night in a submission addressed to the supreme soviet defense authorit ies. Once we were alone, I spoke to Sasha about this and I was glad to dis­ cover that the same thought had occurred to my oId friend.

Two comrades who had been with us at the meeting were of the same mind and offered to sign their names to a joint appeal to the authori ties.

But I was determined to register my view , by way of leaving a testam ent to the future that would prove that I had not stayed silent on the Com munist Party's darkest act of treason to the revol ution . At 2:0() A.M., Sasha telephoned Zinoviev to tell him that he had someth ing important to say to him regarding Kronstadt.

For three years now, famine, cold and economic chaos have trapped us in a vice-like grip. The Communist Party which governs the country has drifted away from the masses and proved itself powerless to rescue them from a state of general ruination. The Party has not taken any heed of the disturbances which have recently occurred in Petro grad and Mosc ow, which plainly demonstrated that it has lost the toiling masses' confidence. Nor has it paid any heed to the demands articulated by the workers. It looks upon all this as inklings of counter-revolution. It is profoundly mistaken. Those disturbances and those demands are the voice of the people as a body, the voice of all who labor. All workers, sailors and Red soldiers today can clearly see that only concerted efforts, only the concerted determination of the people can afford the country bread, wood and coal, can clothe and shoe the people and rescue the Republic from the impasse in which it finds itself.

It was, in fact, the result of the ruling party's policy of seeking to educate the masses empl oying the central­ istic , \"Communist\" approach . When all is said and done, the trade unions' \\\\iork was reduced to utterly useless minutes and correspondence, the object of which was to establish the membership figures of such and such a union and then to record the spec ialty of each member, his standing vis-il-uis the Party, etc. As for economic activity along cooperative lines, or cultural education of the unions' worker membership, not a thing was done in those areas. Which was quite understandable.

No one believed a word from Zinoviev or Trotsky, but where Lenin is concerned, confidence in him had not yet been lost. But ... March 8th saw the opening of the Tenth Congress of the Russian Com­ munist Party . Lenin reiterated there all of the lies about rebel Krons tadt. He declared that the rebellion's watchword was \"freedom of trade. \" True, he did go on to say that \"the movement was for soviets, but against the Bolsheviks' dictatorship\"; but he could not resist invoking \"White generals and petit­ bourgeois anarchist elements. \" So, by uttering rubbish, Lenin confuses himself. He lets slip the admission that the basis of the movement was the fight for soviet power and against the Party's dictatorship. But, rather troubled, he adds: \"Th is is counter -revolu­ tion of another breed. It is extremely dangerous, however insignificant the would-be amendments to our policy may appear at first glanc e.\" There is reason to worry .

After which, vou might think it would be time fo r it to take a back seat. Alas! it seems that the toilers have not shed enough tears and blood. Even as the historic struggle boldly launched by revolut ionary Kronstadt on behalf of the rights of the toiling people, (rights ridiculed and tramp led underfoot by the Com munist s) raged, a flock of crows has dccided to hold its \"Tenth Party Congr ess.\" At which it works out how to carry on, with even more malice and success, its fr atricidal work.

Circumstances have fo rced us to look abroad to purchase not just machinery but also coal, which, however, we have in abundance.\" He went on to say: \"In fu ture, we will still have to make further sacrifices in order to get everyda y consumer goods and also what the agrarian economy needs.\" So where are the famous economic fe ats in the name of which the worker is turned into a slave in the State factory and the peasant laborer into a serf of the sovkhozes? That is not all. Speaking of agriculture, Lenin promises even more \"well­ being,\" if the Communists carry on with their \"economic fu nction arism\" (which was his expression ). \"And if, one day\"-he contin ues-\"we do manage to rebuild great rural economics and big industry here and there , it will only be by imposing further sacrifices upon every producer, while offering nothing in return.\" So much fo r the \"well-being\" which the Bolsheviks' leader dangles as a carrot before all who might docilely bear the yoke of the commissars' abso­ lutism. He was fairly right, the peasant who told the Eighth Congress of Soviets: \"Every thing is going very well. Excep t, whereas we get the land, you get the bread: we get the water, but the fish is yours: the fo rests belong to us, but the wood belongs to you.\" That aside, the toiler need have no worry . Lenin indeed promises \"to award a few incentives to small employe rs, to expand a little the boundaries of the free econom y.\" Like the \"good old sei­ gneur,\" he prepares \"a few incentives\" so as to clamp the toilers' necks even tighter into the vice of the Party's dictatorship later on. As is plain from this admission : \"True, we will not be able to dispense with constraint, fo r the coun try is weary and in terrible poverty.\" There we have it plain: we may have the last shirt off the pauper's back. Which is how Lenin thinks of the task of construction: trade concessions at the top, taxes at the bottom. THE BENEFITS OF THE \"C OMMUNE \" \"Comrades!

So only the bureaucrats are agree­ ably, comforta bly and spaciou sly accomm odated. The number of habitable lodgings has fallen. The workers have stayed where they were . They now live there in dire straits, in worse conditions than before. Houses, not being maintained, are going to wreck and ruin. The heating is out of order. Broken wind ows are not replaced. The roofs are falling apart and water is starting to seep through. Fences collapse. Pipes are half wreck ed. Toilets are out of order and their contents invade the apartme nts, fo rcing citizens to answer their needs in the yard or in a neighbor's place. Staircases are still unlighted: and covered in filth. The yards Jre fu ll of excrem ent, on account of the latrines, rubbish bins, sewage outlets and spouting being neither repaired nor emptied. The streets are filthy. The pavements, which are never repaired, are grimy and slick. Walking the streets is dang erous. To secur e accommodati on, one has to ha ve a good \"connec tion\" in the lodgings office, in the absence of which, just fo rget it. Only the favored fe\\v have accepta ble lodgi ngs. Things are even worse where provisions are concern ed. Irrespon sible, ignorant officials have let thousands of tons of produce spoil. The potatoes distributed are always frost-bitten; the meat, in the spring and summer, always \"off.\" Once upon a time, we \\vere relu ctant to set before the pigs that \\vhich citizens today get from the \"builders of the splendid new life.\" For quite some time, it was \"honest soviet fish,\" herring, that saved the situati on. But now even herri ng is turning into a rarity . Soviet shops are worse than the factory shops of dismal memo ry, where the industrialists used to serve up all sorts of shoddy goods and where their slave workers could not sa y a thing about it. In order to destroy fa mily life, those who govern us have invented the collecti ve restaurant. With what result? The food there is even less appetizing. Before reaching the citizenr y who get only the leftovers, produce is skim med offby every conceivable means. Children's fo od is a little better , but still very inadequate.

(For example, one of the trade unions is curre ntly distributing buttons: one and a half but­ tons per head. Is that not poking fun at everybody?) As for shoes, there just aren't any to be had . The path to the Communist paradise is a beautiful one. But can we tread it barefoot? Meanwhile, there are lots of cracks for all necessities to slip through. The associates of the so-called \"cooperatives\" and those in government own everything. They have their own restaurants and special rations . They can also avail of the \"coupon offices\" which distribute goods as the commissars deem fit. We have finally come to realize that this \"commune\" has undermined and utterly disorganized productive labor. So any urge to work, any interest in work has evaporated. Shoe-makers, tailors, plumbers, etc., have thrown it all up and gone their separate ways, to work as watchmen, messengers, etc. So much for the paradise that the Bolsheviks have set about building. In place of the old one, a new system of arbitrariness, insolence, \"cronyism,\" favoritism, theft and speculation has been erected-a ghastly regime wherein one is obliged to hold out one's hands to the authorities for every crumb of bread, every button; a regime wherein one is not one 's own person, not free to do as one will; a regime of slavery and degradation.

As one who presided over the Kronstadt uprising, I feel that I have a moral duty to educate the British Communist Party's political bureau about that happening. I know that you have been briefed by Moscow, and I know too that such briefings are one-sided and partisan. It would do no harm for you to hear the other side of the story, too. You, yourselves, have conceded that the 1921 Kronstadt uprising was not inspired by outsiders; putting this another way, that means that the patience of the toiling masses, sailors, Red soldiers, \\vorkers and peasants simply had run its course. The people's wrath against the Communist Party dictatorship, or rather, against its bureaucracy, took the form of an uprising: so began the spilling of precious blood-it was not a matter of differences of class or caste-toilers stood on both sides of the barricades.

That the Kronstadters should have turned out, right at that point, to be enemies? So, what crime had Kronstadt committed against the revolu tion? Once the civil war fronts had been mopp ed up, the Petrograd workers reckoned that they could remind the city's soviet that it was now time to turn to their economic circumsta nces and switch trom wartime arrangements to peace-time rule. The Petrograd soviet took the view that this demand of the workers (a demand both harmless and essential) was counter-revolutiona ry. It remained deaf and dumb with regard to these deman ds, but embarked upon search and arrest operations against the workers, declar ing them to be spies and Entente agents. These bureaucrats had been corrupted during the civil war, at a tin'le when nobody dared resist. But they had failed to see that the circumst ances had changed. The workers' response was to strike.

The Kronstadters acted without plan or program, merely feeling their way within the parameters of their resolutions and according to circumstances. Cut off from the whole world, we had no idea what was going on outside Kronstadt, in soviet Russia or abroad. It is possible that certain people might have expected much of our insurrection, as is usually the case, but in our case their pains were in vain.

Being wary of me, my fellow delegates chose Jo:.t q uin Maurinl to speak on behalf of the CNT delegation. Maurin reported back on their first audi­ ence. At the sight of the list of the prisoners whose release was being sought, Dzerzhinsky2 blanched, then went red with fury, arguing that these men were counter-revolutionaries in cahoots with the White generals; he accused them of having derailed trainloads of Red Army troops and of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of soldiers, in the Ukraine especially. We were unable to probe any further into what had happened and Maurin and his friends among our delegation won the day. Not that I gave up, any more, indeed, than a number of delegates of other nationalities did, and we pressed on with our lobbying. Not a single piece of evidence had been adduced to back Dzerzhinsky's claims, not so much as one criminal indictment. No indictment, no trial, no judges, let alone defense lawyers-there was none of that. Whatever the \"people's commissar,\" \\vhose job it was to defend the regime, might have said, this was a case of arbitrary imprisonment. We persisted. As my fellow delegates took the line that it was hopeless and banished the matter from their minds, they at last left it to me to take formal charge of it. The people's commissar for Public Education, Lunacharsky,' visibly discomfited by the role he was forced to play in the name of party discipline, was despatched to us on two occasions but, being unable to take any decisions, he merely acted as an intermediary, receiving and passing Oil re q uests and responses.

This again was a waste of time and the weeks slipped by. They were assuredly determined to wear us down. I regularly went to see Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Through their two rooms paraded the wives whose spouses were imprisoned. Wor­ ried and distraught, they sometimes broke down in tears. And I listened to the odyssey, the liyes of these men who had fallen victim to the so-called socialist State. Victor Serge himself, who from time to time sincerely kept a foot in both camps and carried on writing articles in the western press in favor of the regime, filled me in on their background. Maximoff was an anarcho-syndicalist theoretician of stature, incapable of perpetr ating an act of anti-soviet sabotage. Yartchuk was the erstwhile secretary of the soviet in Kronstadt where Zinoviev had sought refuge when Kerensky ordered him arrested. Voline, the hete noire of government circles, was an anarcho-syndi­ calist theoretician, a lecturer, a gifted writer who had been living in exile at the time of the revolution against tsarism. Such and such was now in prison, someone else banished to Siberia. And all of these authentic revolutionaries were now languishing injails which some of them. such as Maria Spiridonova,5 had occupied years earlier. We sought perm ission to visit them and although we were delegates from trade union organizations which it was hoped to win over, permission was denied. [ remember that in the Spain of Altonso XIII, where I had come from. and during one of the most fearful repressions that country ever expe­ rienced, aside from the Franco era, we were still able to visit prisoners, unless they were being held in secret. In the Modelo prison in Valencia and in the one in 13arcelona, my friends had had no difficulty in seeing me. They had only to ask for me during visiting hours and the warders would escort me down to the visiting room. In the villages of Spain, through which I passed later, I was always able to visit my imprisoned comrades. In the Russia of Lenin and Trotsky, this was impossible. Most of the delegates did not press the matter-not knowing what else to do-but I stuck to my guns. Accusa­ tions were not enough. We were offered no proof and there were too many valid challenges contradicting the authorities' allegations. I was intent upon having proof. Among the female comrades whom I met at Emma Goldman's place was Olga Maximoff/' a thin, thirty-year-old brunette of average height, drained by her ordeals. She had met her spouse while a deportee in Siberia under tsar- 596 ANARCHISTS BEHIND BARS"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"ism, his circumstances being the same.

I would go in with her and other prisoners' wives and would be supplied with Russian papers to get me past the guards. J might fail, but I agreed to chance it. The following day, off I went with four comrades who were traveling as a party . Their bare feet slipped upon the small cobbles and gravel of the city streets. Two of them carried, hanging from their shoulders, a huge canvas bag containing a few provisions obtained with great diffIculty. The youngest of them, Yartch uk's wife, had fought on the barricades in Petrograd and Moscow, in order to bring down first tsarism and then the Kerensky government. At the entrance to the prison, there was a female sentry on duty. She knew my female comrades and barely glanced at their visiting permits. I handed her my papers without uttering a word and she returned them to me with the com­ ment \"Da,\" to which I responded with a smile. Two of the women engaged her in conversation about something while J wandered off with the others. We crossed a courtyard and entered the visiting room. The comrades called out the names of the prisoners whom they wished to see, Voline included. The gap between the visitors and the inmates was no bar to almost direct contact, and no member of staff, or policeman, listened in on the conversations, which, for me, was confirmation that this was a case of preventive detention, with no inquiry and no court proceedings involved. In came the prisoners. \"This is Gaston Leval,\" one of the women told Voline, a man of average height, around forty-five-years of age, wearing a black beard and with the splendid head of a Jewish intellectual. My name was known to him because he had heard tell of me. Effusively, he shook my hand, speaking to me in very correct French. Then, at the risk of startling him and looking a bit ridiculous, but because T was keen to conduct an utterly impartial investigation, I asked him to brief me in detail about what he had been up to since his return to Russia. Over an hour or an hour and a half, with painstaking precision, while I made notes, Voline explained his work as a propagandist and fighter. After a tour of the prison system, Voline had wound up in Butyrky. He related his odyssey to me in a very detailed manner, rehearsing the facts, dates, names, towns and villages. And, along with the rest of the prisoners, he demanded a public trial. ( ... ) I returned to the Lux Hotel, determined to carry on the campaign to release my comrades.

On five or six occasions already, we had met with delegates from the Soviet authorities, and on every occasion, relations had been broken otT or suspended without result. They were sticking to the tactics of attrition. Then the comrades in the Butyrky embarked upon a hunger strike. They smuggled out a manifesto written in French in which they asked syndicalist delegates to lobby the Russian authorities on behalf of their release and free­ dom of thought and expression for all revolutionaries. But the disheartened delegates to whom they appealed merely deplored the strike which was an embarrassment to them. Three, four and five days passed. I could do nothing at the congress. Marginalized by my fellow-delegates and unused as I was-on account of the clandestine activity to which I had been condemned thus far-to maneuvers and counter-mane uvers, commissions and backstairs lobbying, I was reduced to inactivity and powerlessness. Although more coherent and, for the most part, oppositionist, the French delegation was likewise unable to do much more. Our comrades pressed on with their hunger strike. We were told that in Orel and in other towns whose names I cannot now recall, there were similar strikes and that two or three of the strikers had perished. Which was not impo ssible, for all of Russia's jails were bulging with prisoners who had been prompted to protest by the international congresses, in the hope that their voices might reach beyond the borders of Bolshevik Russia. What else was there for them to do? Five days, six days, seven days. One or two delegates made isolated efforts but all to no avail. At Emma Goldman's and Alexander Berkman's apart­ ments could I still see our comrades' womenfolk, distraught and tormented and occasionally in tears in that news of executions might arrive at any time. Olga Maximoff arrived to tackle me again at the congress and, knowing no French, she tugged at my jacket while repeating in tones of supplication and with pleading eyes that I can still hear and see: \"Comrade Leva!, Comrade Leval!\" Seven days, eight days, nine days! We were distraught, not knowing where to turn. And I found the oppos ition delegates powerless and disheartened. Others, powerless to do anything, even took our comrades to task for having exploited their presence and placed them in an uncomfortable position.

( ... ) Angel Pe staiia2 was charged to travel to Ru ssia in order to attend the second congress of the Th ird Internat ional and communicate the decision s taken by the conf ede ral congress. THE SECOND CONGRESS OFTHE COM MUNIST INTERNATIONAL (JUNE 1920)1 The Thir d Interna tional's secon d congre ss opened on 28 June J 920 in its head quarters in Mosc ow. Straight off, Zin oviev moved that the Spanish Conf ederation be accep ted as a member of the Th ird Interna tion al's Execu­ tive Committee, wh ich was agreed. Co mrade Lo zovsky,2 in turn, moved that a revo lution ary trade un ion International be orga nized . To that end, he read out a document whic h declare d: In most of the belligerent countries, most of the trade unions had been sup­ porters of neutrality (apoliticism) during the grievous war years: they had been the slaves of imperialist capitalism and had played a poisonous role in delaying the emancipation of the toilers ( ... ); the dictatorship of the bour­ geoisie must be countered by the dictatorship of the proletariat, the on ly olle capable of breaking the resistance of the exploiters and thereby ensure that the conquest of power by the proletariat is consolidated, as the only decisive, transitional method. Following upon whic h the congre ss decided to: Condemn all tactics designed to remove vanguard elements from existing trade union organizations, and instead radically to remove from the leader­ ship of the trade union movement opportunists who had collaborated with the bourgeois by embracing the war: ANAR CHISM IN THE SPANISH CiVil WAR 609"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"( ... ) Wage methodIcal propaganda inside trade union organizations the world over, establishing within each one a communist cell which might eventu ally impose its viewpoint.

That council will comprise representatives from all affiliated national labor organizations. ( . .. ) When my turn to speak came, I stated: \"Three items from the docu­ ment will be the focus of a quick and concrete scrutiny, in that the organiza­ tions which I represent have espoused a stance which quite distances them from this document; those three items are: 1) Apol iticism; 2) the conquest of power; and, 3) the dictatorship of the proletariat.\" ( .. . ) In effect, apoliticism is, in this document, damned by some trade union organizations, when virtually all of the trade union organizations which took a hand in the imperialist war were politicized, which runs counter to what this document asserts ( .. . ) So where is the logic in this docu ment? The remaining two items relate to the conquest of power and dictatorship of the proletariat ( ... ) A few words would suffice to spell out the thinking of the Confederation which I am here to represent with regard to these two matters. On this score, let me remind you that at the Confederation's first congress held in Madrid during the second fortnight of December last year, it was decided unanimously by the five hundred delegates present that the ultimate objective was the establishment oflibertarian communism. ( . .. ) Let me add a couple of words more on the article commending close collaboration with the politicized communist proletariat. The Confederation is agreeable to cooperation with all revolutionary organizations fighting against the capitalist regime, while reserving the right, however, to do so as it sees fit. I do not think, indeed, that the Confederation would consent to act if its freedom of action were called into question ( . . . ) There was no discuss ion of par agraphs one or two. In the course of discussion of parag raph three, I reaffirmed that we were apolitical and that we had to resist war by whatever means and that it was flying in the face of reason to endorse a docum ent that condemned our action and our principle s.

When I was called as a speaker, I reminded deleg ates that they were already conversant with my dif ferences with regard to the conquest of po wer and dic tatorship of the prole tariat , and that these po si­ tions were not pe rsonal to me, but refl ected the Co nfeder ation's po sition . I announced that, this be ing the cas e, if the ma jority fo rced me to agree to the docum ent as it stood, I would sign it but would first issue the fo llo w­ ing caution: Everything having to do with conquest of political power, dictatorship of the proletariat and cooperation with the Communist political proletariat remains subject to further decisions to be made by the Confederation upon my return to Spain, and the Con federal Committee has been briefed about everything decided at this gathering. The same thing applied to the summons due to be issued to trade union orga­ niz ations the world over. It was indicated in that summons that those national and inte rnational trades' unions, local and regional unions which accepted revolutionary class stru ggle , were invited to attend the conf erenc e. I was not in agreement either with ( ... ) this summons wh ich ( ... ) ruled out lots of org anizations that would have liked to attend the conf erence but which were not in agreement with dic tatorship or with the conquest of po wer.

But he soon realized that the congress itself was a pantomime. The chair made the rules, amended propositions as it saw fit, turned the agenda upside down and tabled propositions off its own bat. The way in which it manipulated the congress was thoroughly abusive : Zinoviev delivered a speech lasting an hour and a half, even though no speech was to have exceeded ten minutes in duration. Pestana made to reply to that speech, but he was \"guillotined\" after ten minutes by the chairman brandishing a watch. Pestana himself was criticized by Trotsky in another speech that lasted over three quarters of an hour, and when Pestana made to reply to the attacks leveled at him by Trotsky, the chairman wound up the proceedi ngs. He also had to register a protest at the manner in which rappor teurs were appointed. In theory, every delegate was free to table a motion, but the chair itself selected the ones that were \"inter­ esting .\" Proportional voting [by delegation or delegate] had been provided fo r, but was not implemented. The Russian Commun ist Party ensured that it enjoyed a comfortable majority . To top it all, certain important decisions were not even made in the congress hall, but were made behind the scenes. Which is how the following text came to be adopted: In forthcoming world congresses of the Third International, the national trade union organizations affiliated to it are to be represented by delegates from each country's Communist Party. Objections to this decision were quite simply ignored. Pestana left Russia on September 6, 1920, after a short exchange of impr essions with Armando Borghi2 ( .•. ) the delegate from the Italian Syndicalist Union (USI), who re­ turned to Italy disheartened by this unfortunate experience. But before they left Mosc ow, both would have been aware of the circular issued regardi ng the organization of the Red International of Labor Unions. If, in the forthcom­ ing congress of the Third Internation al, the intention was to guara ntee the Comm unist parties ascendancy over the trade union organizations, it could be supposed that the green light would have been given fo r the affiliated labor organizations inside the trade union International .

Lef t to its own devices, the repub lican bour geoisie would have been overwhel med. That alliance could not be confined to the realm of politic s. Synd icalists and anarchists had had bad exp eriences with the bourgeois Republ ic. So it was unthin kable that they should rest co ntent with thwarting the clerico­ militarist reb ellion. The initiation of changes to the economic system was to be ex pected. Indeed , they could not carry on putting up with eco nomic expl oitation which was, in their eyes, the root of po litical oppre ssion. These were fa cts known to the cle rgy, the military cabal and the big capitalists who had ties to the first two of these clans. They were well aware of what was at stake and what the im plications were. ( .. . ) For which reason the privileged class sided with the rebel military leaders. Whereas the generals were the actors, the big capitalists pulled the stri ng s while remai ning in the background.

It goes without saying that the liberal and soc ialist sec tor, hoisted back into po wer by the February 1936 elections, after two years of black reac tion, was greatly upset , but the hesitancy of the bour geois repu blicans, who were more or less hungry fo r ref orms, was in the last resort ov erruled by the audac ity of more extreme elements .

His teache r's evaluation of Du rruti after he completed his studies was: \"A pupil with a tal­ ent for lite rature , unrul y, but good-hearte d.\" At four teen, he entered a machine shop as an appr entic e, leaving at the age of eig hteen, having received sound training, as he proved when he got his first job in Matallana de To rio, installing baths at the pit -head . Afte r that, he joined the Northern railroad compan y as machine-fitt er. This happ ened in 1914, when the First World War broke out. Although Leo n was un der the thumb of the clergy and aristocr acy , the Spanish Soci alist Party (PSO E) and Gen eral Workers' Union (U GT) had a wor king-class core there.

To spell out their point of view, they organized a huge gathering involving 10,000 of them, during which they passed the following resolution: We are not refusing to do our civic and revolutionary duty.

At present, the essentia l issue is not the conversion of the militia, a body of partisans suited to guerrilla warfare, into a regular army with all of the characteristics of a professional army. The point is, rather, to raise the militia units' own expertise by learning from the tactical ideas of the combat group and section school, as applied in the main armies of Europe, and kitting out the combat groups with appropriate equipment (automatic weapons, hand grenades, rifle grenade s, etc.). Doing otherwise would amount to staking all upon a Napoleonic battle, all of the wherewithal of which has yet to be created as far as the Spanish antifascist camp is concern ed.

The Iron Column must describe its structure and its internal organiza­ tion. On this score, debate ought to focus on a number of points. For one thing, the militarization issue, for there is a government decree providing for militarization of all columns, and there are comrades who believe that militariza tion settles everything.

In place of corporals, sergeants and of ficer graduates from academies who are sometimes abysmally ignorant of the problems of war, we offer our organization and accept no military structure. The Iron Column and all of the CNT and FAI columns-and, indeed, others which are not con federal columns-have not found military discipline acceptable. SINGLE COMMAND OR COORDINATION? In a motion tabled and approved at a meeting in Valencial by the CNT, the FAI, the Iron Column, etc., wherein the need was expressed for the establishment of a body to liaise between the forces fighting in Teruel and on a number of fronts, a request was made that war committees and column committees be set up, with an eye to establishing a delegate operations committee, made up of two civilian delegates and a general technician in an advisory capacity per column, plus the delegate from the people's executive committee, to act as liaison between the Teruel columns and those on other fronts. Which is to say that we, who are against what is termed the single com­ mand, propaga te, by example and practice, coordination of all fighting forces. We cannot countenance some staff, some minister, with no practical acquain tance with the situation on the ground, and who have never set foot on the field of battle and know nothing of the mentality of the men they com­ mand (which ignorance may well extend also to military expertise ) should direct us from behind desks and issue us with orders, mostly inane ones. And as we have virtually always had to submit to the orders from the military command, war delegates and delegations from the staff, we must protest and request that the aforesaid Valencia staff be stood down. For as long as we have abided by it, such was the extent of the disorientation that we knew nothing of the situation on other fronts, nor about the activities of other col umns: we suffered bombardment without managing to discover whence it emanated. Which is why we suggest that an operations committee be established, made up of direct representatives of the columns and not, as the marxists wish, of represent atives from each organizational grouping; we want representatives familiar with the terrain and who know their way around. The establishment of war committees is acceptable to all con federal mi­ litias. We start with the individual and form groups of ten, which come to accommodations among themselves for small-scale operat ions. Ten such groups together make up one CENTURIA, which appoints a delegate to represent it. 648 DURRUTI AND LIBER TARIAN WARFARE"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"Thirty CENTURIAS make up one col umn, which is directed by a war commit­ tee, on which the delegates from the CENTURIAS have their say. Another point is the matter of the coordination of all fronts. This will be handled by the committees constituted by two civilian delegates with one military delegate in an advisory capacity, in addition to the delegation from the people's executive committ ee. Thus, although every column retains its freedom of action, we arrive at coordination of forces, which is not the same thing as unity of command. The marxists and republicans did not want that, because they said that the columns ought not to debate and that everybody had to abide by whatever the staff orders. Thus, better a defeat under the staff than fi fty victories under fi fty committe es. MILITARY HIERARCHY OR FEDERALISM? As for militarization, we will readily concede that the military, who have spent their entire lives studying the tactics of warfare, are better informed than us and that their advice is often more valuable than ours. Conseq uently, we ac­ cept their advice and their contributio n. Inside our column, fo r instance, the Inilitary personn el in whom we have every con fi dence, work in concert with us and together we coordinate our efforts: but if we should be militarized, only one thing can happen, which is that [we switch] from a federalist structur e to a barrack-style discipline, which is the very thing that we do not want. There is talk too of amalgamating militias. We reckon that association on the basis of af fi nity should prevail tomorrow just as it does today. Let indi­ viduals come together in accordance with their thinking and temperament . Let those who think along such and such lines combine their ef forts in order to achieve their common goals. If columns are formed along heterogeneous lines, we will achieve nothing practical. Which means that we do not in any way surrender the columns' indepen­ dence and have no wish to subject ourselves to any governmental command. We fi ght, fi rst to defeat fascism, and then for our ideal, which is anarchy. Our activity ought not to tend to strengthen the State, but rather to progressi vely destroy it and render government redu ndant.

For example, in the column which I represent, out of its three thousand component mem bers, we may say that only around a thou sand rifles have been fu rnished by the State and we have had to find all the rest ourselv es, 80 percent of them having been taken fr om the en emy. Which means to sa y that the State, the gov ernment, official bod­ ies have shown no interest in the question of arming and equipping columns with the ma terial they need. This is a matter the orga nization ought to have resolv ed, and in Va lencia, very little heed was paid to it. The org ani zation mu st see to it that we want fo r nothing. It has also been said that disci pline ave rts demoralization and desertion. That is £u fr om certai n. Co urage and fe ar depend on man y fa ctors , fo r the same person may be afraid in one engag ement and beha ve lik e a downrig ht hero in another. Dis cipl ine or not, it all works out the same, since it has been established that those \\vho are militarized are the first to turn tail and run; and when dang er arises, the individ ual, be he anar chist, marxist or republi­ can, is gripped by the same instinct fo r self -preservation and either flees or adv ances. THE PAY QUESTION Here now, we have another problem, whic h, we contend, it is fo r the orga­ nization to resolve. The rapp orteurs' commission says that militians mu st be economicall y dependent on the State. Our ans wer to that must be that to begin with, the Conf ederation's columns were fo rmed spontaneo usly and set off fo r the front. Nobody spared a thoug ht fo r pay, beca use the villages where those combatants lived looked after their fa milies, whose needs were thus provided fo r: but a poin t cam e when the villag es stopped looking after the t�ll nilies and the complaints began .

This new phase of the fight against fa scism, and in the development of the Spanish trade union and anarchist move ment, should not be viewed in terms of doc trine on ly. On July 19, it was the anarchists and trade unionists who marched at the head of the revol utionary movement to conf ront the fa scist gener als. The creation of antif ascist militias and the collecti vization of industry in Catalonia were primar ily the handi work of the CNT -FAI. For a time, there were two sorts of gov ernments: on the one hand, the Ge neralidad, on the other the Antif ascist Militias' Co mmittee and the Eco­ nomic Council. It was soon realized that this duality could not continue. Whereupon there arose the Generalidad General Co uncil, co mprising all of the antif ascist orga nizations. In Catalonia, in Le vante and in Arag on, where trade unionists and anarchists account fo r more than half of the antif ascist fo rces, fa scism was wiped out co mplet ely, whereas in those districts where the democ ratic socialists and other parties were in the asc endancy , the strug gle did not have such a fe licitous outcome. In Madrid, trade unionists are in the minor ity. Ho wever their infl uence has grown oflate. For more than two months now, the CNT has been calling fo r the disso lution of the government and the creation of a National Def ense Council, with equa l partici pation of the CNT and the UGT. Lar go Ca ballero was unwilling to give up the levers of power; he wanted to be Spai n's Lenin. His policy tended to weaken the antif ascist fighting fr ont. The dispensing of weapons to the various parties and organizations was cond ucted with partial­ ity, and the need fo r uni ty in the conduct of the war was fe lt with increasing urgency . Be ing me rely soldiers of the Revolution and letting Com munists and So­ cialists act as the generals was not a course that could have satisfied the trade unionists and anarc hists. They too were entitled to have their say in national deliberations on the prosecution of the war. Hence the CNT' s request con­ cerning creation of a National Def ense Council. Ca ballero was not willing to surrender one iota of his power. Mean whi le, the military situation in Madrid was growing more critical each day. Unity in the direction of the war is not fe asible unless the CNT is called upon to share in that direction .

Valencia carries on with Madrid's policy . That must change . And, in order to change it, it has to spell out all its own thinking loud and clear, because there are influences at work in Valencia that favor a compromise with Franco. Jean Zyrom ski6 wrote in Le Po p u/aire, of March 3: The intrigues are there to be seen and they are aimed at concluding a peace which would in fact signif y not just the halting of the Spanish revolution, but indeed the abolition of what social progress has been achiev ed. \"Neither Cabal­ lero nor Franco ,\" that would be the catch-phrase summing up a notion which is in the air, and I am not sure that it may not be favored by certain political, diplomatic and indeed government circles in England and in France alike. Such influences, such mane uvers account fo r a variety of gray areas: the inactivity of the loyalist fleet, for instanc e. The marshaling of fo rces fr om Morocco, the piracy by the Canarias and the Balear cs7 and the fa ll of Malag a are the conseq uences of that inactivity. And the war is not yet over! IfPrieto� is so inept and lazy, why put up with him? If Prieto 's hands are tied by a policy that has him keep the fleet paralyzed, why not denounce that policy? You anarchist ministers make eloquent speeches and write brilliant articles, but one does not win the war and defend the Revol ution with speeches and articles. The one is won and the other defended by the passage from defensive to offensive. Positional strategy cannot carry on fo rever. The problem can only be resolved by launching the watchwor ds: general mobilization, weapons to the fronts, single command, people's army, etc., The problem is resolved by doing immedi ately whatever is practicable.

A domestic policy of class collaboration and flirtation with the middle classes inevitable leads to tolerance being shown to politicall y dubious elements. The \"fifth column\" is made up, not just of elements belonging to fascist organizations, but also of all the malcontents who yearn for a moderate republic. Now, it is the latter who profit from the tolera nce displayed by those who hunt down the \"uncontrolla bles.\" The mopping-up of the internal front was conditional upon wide-rang­ ing and radical action by the defense committees set up by the CNT and the UGT. We are witnessing the infiltration into the officer corps of the Popular Army of questiona ble elements who cannot offer the assurances of political and trade union affiliation. The militias' committees and political delegates exer­ cised a salutary control which has today been undermined by the prevalence of strictly military schemes of advancement and promo tional. The authority of the committees and delegates must be strengthened. We are witnessing something new, with poten tially danger ous conse­ quences-to wit, whole battalions under the command of officers who do not enjoy the respect and affection of the militians. This is a serious matter, because the value of most Spanish militians is in direct proportion with the confidence enjoyed by their own commanders. So, direct election and the rights of the rank and file to dismiss must be reintr oduced. A grave mistake was made in accepting authoritarian practi ces, not because they were so formally authoritarian, but because they enshrined enorm ous er­ rors and political aims that had nothing to do with the demands of the war. I have had occasion to speak with Italian, French and Belgian superior officers, and I have noticed that they display a much more modern and ra­ tional underst anding of discipline than certain neo-generals who purport to be realists. I believe the time has come to fo rm the confederal army, just as the Social­ ist Party has launched its own troop in the shape of the 5th Regiment of People's Militias.

Above all, we must keep up the morale of the fighte rs. Luigi Bertoni, 'liarticu­ lating feelings expressed by various Italian comrades fighting on the Huesca front, wrote, not so long ago: \"The Spanish war, thus bereft of all new faith. all notion of social change, all revolutionary grandeur, all universal import. is left as a vulgar war of national indepe ndence which has to be waged in order to avert the exterm ination which the world plutocracy has in mind. It remains a terrifying life or death issue, but is no longer a war for the establishment of a new system and a new humanity. It will be said that all is not yet lost. but in reality all is in jeopardy and invested. Our side uses the language of renunciation, as did Italian socialism in the face of fascism's advance: 'Beware of provocations' Keep calm, keep cool ' Order and discipline\" All of which in practice boils down to laissez- fire. Andjust as Fascism wound up winning in Italy, so in Spain anti-socialism in republ ican garb cannot but win, failing unforeseen events. Needless to add, we are merely placing this on record JIld not condemning our side: we cannot say how they might act differently and with effect as long as the Italo-German pressure is growing at the front and that of the Bolshev iko-bou rgeois in the rear. I do not have Luigi Bertoni's mode sty. I venture to assert that Spanish anarchists could pursue a different policy line from the prevailing one; I claim that I can, on the basis of what I know about the experiences of various great recent revolu tions and what I read in the Spanish libertarian press itself, recommend a fe w policy lines. I believe that you must tackle the problem of whether you defend the Revolution better by making a larger contribution to the tight against fa scism by participating in government, or whether you might not be intini tely more useful carrying the torch of your magnific ent oratory among the fighters and in the rear. The time has also come to clarify the unitary import which our partici pa­ tion in the government may have. We must address the masses, and call upon them to judge whether Marcel Cachin11 is right when he declares in L'humanite of 23 March: \"The anarchist leaders are redoubl ing their unitary efforts and 666 ANAR CHO-SYNDICALISM IN GOVERNMENT"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"their appeals are heeded more and more.\" Or whether it is Pravda and Izvestia which are right when they vilify the Spanish anarchists by depicting them as sabota ging unity. We must appeal to the mass to sit in judgment of the moral and political complicity of the Spanish anarchist press's silence concerning Stalin 's dicta­ torial crimes, the persec utions visited on Russian anarchists, the monstrous trials mounted against the Leninist and Trotskyist opposition, a silence duly rewarded by Izvestia's defamatory remarks about Solidaridad Obrera. The masses must be called upon to judge whether certain ploys designed to sabotage supplies are not part and parcel of the plan announced on December 17, 1936 by Pravda: \"As for Catalonia, the purging of Trotskyist and anarchist syndic alist elements has begun; this endeavor will be prosecuted with the same vigor with which it has been carried out in the USSR.\" The time has come to gauge whether anarchists are in government to act as the vestals of a flame on the verge of going out, or whether they are hencef orth there solely to serve as a Phrygian cap for politicians flirting with the enemy or with forces keen to restore the \"republic of all classes .\" The problem is posed by the obviousness of a crisis deeper than the men who are its representative personali ties. The dilemma -war or revolution -no longer has any meaning. The only dilemma is this: either victory over Franco, thanks to revolutionary war, or defeat. The problem for you and other comrades is to choose between Thiers's Versailles and the Paris of the Commune, before Thiers and Bismarck cobble together a sacred union.

In spite of eve rything that the men of the CNT -FAI did, scurr ying around and po pping up everywh ere, things went fr om bad to worse every day. So I said: \"We cannot be on the streets and in the gov ernment at one and the same time .\" We were in the gov ernment, but the streets were slipping away fr om us. We had lost the workers' trust and the movement's uni ty had been whittled away. On the day when we quit the Caballer o gove rnment, after the May 1937 events in Ba rcelona -a coup caref ull y con trived by Russian agents casting around fo r an excuse to stam p out the anarchist movement in Spain -I was immens ely relieve d, as I imagine my colleagues were too. The war, meanw hile, was virtu ally lost -the Revol ution, too. We were split by con troversy over what policy to adopt during those final months . There were comrades who shared the republ icans' opi nion and be lieved that some way had to be fo und of ave rting the fina l catas trop he. Ot hers, on the other hand, called fo r a fight to the finish, even where hop e had evap ora ted. Juan Negrin! was the leading lig ht of the die-hard line, arguing that a world war would erupt bef ore the ye ar was out. Was he sincere? Be that as it may, Mariano R. Va zquez , then the CNT' s general secr eta ry, was of the same mind. So too were most comra des. Had we held out until September 1939, war would have been upon us. Wo uld things have changed fo r us? Judging by the way Hitler handled the ini tial fighting, and in light of the lig htning­ quick invasion of Fran ce, which reached the Pyrene es within a fe w days , that is questio nab le.

At the Congress of Local Federations held in Paris on Ma y 1, 1945, after eight days of heated argumen ts, the adv ersaries of political collaboration won the fl fSt round. We had made our self -cr iticism.
