have probably all hear d about over the years goes 2 something like the following: 3 1. There are two of you: 4 1.1. The physical man and woman that was created when you were born. We will call this the “natural being” within 5 this document. 6 1.2. An artificial entity that you represent which is cr eated by the government and therefore subject to government 7 statutes and regulations. This is called the “ straw man ”. 8 2. The straw man is the method by which natural beings “interface” to the commercial world and to the government . 9 Without using the straw m an, you the natural being would be unable to sustain your life because you would be 10 maliciously deprived of the ability to : 11 2.1. Obtain government identification. 12 2.2. Interact commercially with others. 13 3. The government had to create the straw man because it can’t leg islative for the natural being. This is because the 14 natural being is sovereign, and therefore not subject to the law. 15 “Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but in our system, 16 while sovereign power s are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the 17 people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts. And the law is the definition and limitation of 18 power .” 19 [Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) ] 20 The only thing the government can legislative for or tax are its own creations, so it created the straw man in order to 21 indirectly control, tax, and regulate human beings that would otherwise be beyond their jurisdiction. 22 4. The straw man is represented by your all caps name in combination with a government license number. T he natural 23 being is represented by the Christian lower case name without any government identifying n umber . 24 This pamphlet will use evidence to prove the existence of the “ straw man ”, show how it is created, describe how you can 25 know you are filling its shoes, and describe all the consequences of filling its shoes. We will end the document by directing 26 you at resources that will help you destroy the straw man , force the government to recognize its existence, and suggest 27 ways to function without it. 28 The content of this memorandum is really nothing more than a confirmation of the truths fo und in the followin g document: 29 Why Statutory Civil Law is Law for Government and Not Private Persons , Form #05.037 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm All we are going to prove indirectly is that: 30 1. Nearly all statutory civil law is law for government. 31 2. The only way you can become the subje ct of nearly all statutory civil law is to become an agent, officer, or contractor 32 within the government through the exercise of your right to contract. 33 3. The mechanism by which you become part of the government under the civil law is by signing up for gover nment 34 franchises. All franchises are contracts between the grantor, which is the government, and the grantee, which is you 35 the private person. 36 4. When you become subject to a franchise agreement within the civil law , you enter a partnership between the “res” or 37 “public office” created by your right to contract, and you the private man. That partnership makes you surety for the 38 actions of the officer who runs the entity and makes you a “person” within the meaning of statutory law who is 39 therefore subject to t hat law or franchise . 40 In this treatise, we will not advocate or endorse any of the following misperceptions being taught in the freedom 41 community: 42 1. That birth certificates are used by the government to create a Treasury account they can make withdrawals fro m. 43"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 20 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ 2. That you have the right to create security interests without consideration using the “straw man” and the Uniform 1 Commercial Code . 2 3. That you can pay your tax bill with bills of exchange or promissory note s. 3 4. That there is any lawful commercial use you can put to the public office that the government creates as a private person 4 not subject to the franchise agreement that created the straw man . 5 All of the above ideas are examined and rebutted in the following document: 6 Policy Document: UCC Redemption , Form # 08.002 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm This is a fascinating subject that we have h eard a lot of people talk about but which very few, in our experience, really 7 understand. Hold on to your seats, because what you are about to read is likely to shatter a lot of misconceptions which 8 have evolved in your mind over the years mainly because of the vacuum of credible information about this subject. 9 2 WHAT is a “straw man”? 10 Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition , defines the term “straw man” as follow s: 11 Straw man . A “front”; a third party who is put up in name only to take part in a transaction. Nominal party to 12 a transaction; one who acts as an agent for another for the purpose of taking title to real prop erty and 13 executing whatever documents and in struments the principal may direct respecting the property. Person who 14 purchases property, or to accomplish some purpose otherwise not allowed. 15 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1421 ] 16 The criteria for the existence of the “straw man” therefore is: 17 1. A commercial transaction involving property . 18 2. Agency of one or more persons on behalf of another person or artificial entity who accomplish es the commercial 19 transaction . 20 3. Property being acquired by a party that otherwise is not allowed or not lawful . 21 An example of a “straw man”, would be the agency created when several companies were contracted privately and 22 individually by Walt Disney to buy t he land used to build Walt Disney World in Florida . Walt d idn’t tell the sellers who 23 the real and final buyer was or what he was doing as a company because if he had used his company’s name, the own ers 24 would have bid up the price or not sold at all and thereby thwarted his plans . Only after he had bought the several pieces of 25 land that he needed through intermediaries did he transfer the titles for all the pieces of land that he had bought collectiv ely 26 into the name of his company. 27 We will now analyze the three elements that form the basis for the existence of the straw man in the following subsections . 28 2.1 Commercial transaction 29 Every commercial transaction you engage in represents an exercise of your r ight to contract. That contract can be ex press, 30 which means in writing , or implied, which means based on your conduct. Below is the definition of the term “ contract ” 31 from the legal dictionary which shows you how implied contracts can be created without y our knowledge or express 32 consent . 33 CONTRACT. A promissory agreement between two or more persons that creates, modifies, or destroys a legal 34 relation. Buffalo Pressed Steel Co. v. Kirwan, 138 Md. 60, 113 A. 628, 630 ; Mexican Petroleum Corporation of 35 Louisiana v. North German Lloyd, D.C.La., 17 F.2d 113,114. 36 An agreement, upon sufficient consideration , to do or not to do a particular thing. 2 Bl.Comm. 442; 2 Kent, 37 Comm. 449. Justice v.

Lee v. Travelers’ 2 Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn., 173 S.C. 185, 175 S.E. 429. 3 A deliberate [e.g. volunta ry] engagement between competent parties, upon a legal consideration, to do, or 4 abstain from doing, some act . Wharton; Smith v. Thornhill, Tex.Com.App. 25 S.W.2d 597, 599. It is agreement 5 creating obligation, in which there must be competent parties, subject- matter, legal consideration, mutuality 6 of agreement, and mutuality of obligation, and agreement must not be so vague or uncertain that terms are 7 not ascertainable. H. Liebes & Co. v. Klengenberg, C. C.A.Ca1.. 23 F.2d 611. 612. A contract or agreement is 8 either where a promise is made on one side and assented to on the other; or where two or more persons enter 9 into engagement with each other by a promise on either side. 2 Steph.Comn1. 54. The writing which contains 10 the agreement of parties, with the terms and conditions, and which serves as a proof of the obligation. 11 [. . .] 12 Constructive Contract 13 Constructive contracts are such as arise when the law prescribes the rights and liabilities of persons who have 14 not in reality entered into a contract at all, but between whom circumstances make it just tha t one should have a 15 right, and the other be subject to a liability, similar to the rights and liabilities in cases of express contract. 16 Donovan v. Kansas City, 352 Mo. 430, 175 S.W.2d 874, 884. 17 [. . .] 18 Quasi Contracts 19 In the civil law. A contractual relation arising out of transactions between the parties which give them mutual 20 rights and obligations, but do not involve a specific and express convention or agreement between them. 21 Keener, Quasi Contr. 1; Elbert County v. Brown, 16 Ga.App. 834, 86 S.E. 651, 665. The lawful and purely 22 voluntary acts of a man, from which there results any obligation whatever to a third person, and sometimes a 23 reciprocal obligation between the parties. Civ. Code La. art. 2293 . 24 Persons who have not contracted with each other are often regarded by the Roman law, under a certain state of 25 facts, as if they had actually concluded a convention between themselves. The legal relation which then takes 26 place between these persons, which has always a similarity to a contract obligation, is therefore termed 27 \"obligatio quasi ex contractu.\" Such a relation arises from the conducting of affairs without authority. 28 (negotiorum gestio,) from the payment of what was n ot due, (solutio indebiti,) from tutorship and curatorship, 29 and from taking possession of an inheritance. Mackeld.Rom.Law 5 491. 30 Legal fiction invented by common law courts to permit recover y by contractual remedy of assumpsit in cases 31 where, in fact, there is no contract, but where circumstances are such that justice warrants a recovery as 32 though there had been a promise. Clark v. Peoples Savings and Loan Ass’n of De Kalb County, 221 Ind. 168, 33 46 N.E.2d 681, 682, 144 A.L.R. 1495. It is not based on intention or consent of the parties, but is founded on 34 considerations of justice and equity, and on doctrine of unjust enrichment. Bruggeman v. Independent School 35 Dist., No. 4, Union Tp., Mitchell County, 227 Iowa 661, 289 N.W. 5, 8, 11. 36 It is not in fact a contract, but an obligation which the law creates in absence of any agreement, when and 37 because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, 38 under such circumstances that i n eq uity and good conscience he ought not to retain it. Grossbier v. 39 Chicago, St. P., M. & 0. Ry. Co.. 173 Wis. 503. 181 N.W. 746, 748: It is an implication of law. First Nat. Bank 40 v. Matlock, 99 Okl. 150. 226 P. 328, 331, 36 A.L.R. 1088; Caldwell v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co., 148 Ark. 41 474, 230 S.W. 566, 568. It is what was formerly known as the contract Implied in law; it has no reference to the 42 Intentions or expressions of the parties. The obligation is imposed despite, and frequently in frustra tion of their 43 intention. Town of Balkan v. Village of Buhl, 158 Minn. 271, 197 N.W. 266, 35 A.L.R. 470. 44 [. . .] 45 Express and Implied 46 An express contract is an actual agreement of the parties, the terms of which are openly uttered or declared at 47 the time of making it, being stated in distinct and explicit language, either orally or in writing. 2 Bl.Comm. 443 ; 48 2 Kent, Comm. 450; Linn v. Ross, 10 Ohio 414, 36 Am.Dec. 95; A. J. Yawger & Co. v. Joseph, 184 Ind. 228, 49 108 N.E. 774, 775; In re Pierce, Butler & Pierce Mfg. Co., D.C.N.Y., 231 F. 312, 318 . 50 An implied contract is one not created o r evidenced by the explicit agreement of the parties, but inferred by 51 the law, as a matter of reason and justice from their acts or conduct, the circumstances surrounding the 52 transaction making it a reasonable, or even a necessary, assumption that a contra ct existed between them by 53 tacit understanding .

Borough of Shenandoah, C.C.A.Pa., 115 F.2d 886, 867. 3 Implied contracts are sometimes subdivided into those \"implied in fact\" and those \"implied in law,\" the 4 former being covered by the definition just given, while the latter are obligations imposed upon a person by 5 the law, not in pursuance of his intention and agreement, either expressed or implied, but even against his 6 will and design, because the circumstances between the parties are such as to render it just that the me 7 should have a right, and the other a corresponding liability, similar to those which would arise from a 8 contract between the. This kind of obligation therefore rests on the principle that whatsoever it is certain a 9 man ought to do that the law will suppose him to have promised to do. And hence it is s aid that, while the 10 liability of a party to an express contract arises directly from the contract, it is just the reverse in the case of a 11 contract \"implied in law,\" the contract there being Implied or arising from the liability. Bliss v. Hoy , 70 Vt. 12 534, 41 A. 1026; Kellum v. Browning's Adm'r. 231 Ky. 308. 21 S.W.2d 459, 465. But obligations of this kind are 13 not properly contracts at all, and should not be so denom inated. There can be no true contract without a 14 mutual and concurrent intention of the parties. Such obligations are more properly described as \"quasi 15 contracts.\" Un ion Life Ins. Co. v. Glasscock, 270 Ky. 750, 110 S.W.2d 681, 686, 114 A. L. R. 373. 16 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 395 ] 17 The elements required to establish a binding and legally enforceable contract are: 18 1. An offer. 19 2. Mutual consideration. 20 3. Mutual voluntary consent. 21 4. The absence of any duress upon either party. 22 5. Mutual assent or understanding of every aspect of the agreement and all the ramifications o f the property being 23 exchanged. 24 Any transaction which does not contain all of the above elements is voidable but not void. A legal proceeding would 25 usually be necessary to void the transaction if the other party is unwilling to undo the unsatisfactory tra nsaction voluntarily. 26 For instance, here is what the American J urisprudence Legal Encyclopedia, Second Edition says ha ppens to such a 27 transaction if duress is present: 28 “An agreement [consensual contract] obtained by duress, coercion, or intimidation is invalid, since the party 29 coerced is not exercising his free will, and the test is not so much the means by which the party is compelled to 30 execute the agreement as the state of mind induced. 1 Duress, like fraud, rarely becomes material, except where 31 a contract or conveyance has been made which the maker wishes to avoid. As a general rule, duress renders 32 the contract or co nveyance voidable, not void, at the option of the person coerced, 2 and it is susceptible of 33 ratification. Like other voidable contracts, it is valid until it is avoided by the person entitled to avoid it. 3 34 However, duress in the form of physical compu lsion, in which a party is caused to appear to assent when he has 35 no intention of doing so, is generally deemed to render the resulting purported contract void. 4 ” 36 [American Jurisprudence 2d, Duress, Section 21 ] 37 Examples of voidable contracts that do not contain all the above elements include: 38 1. The contract has does not have the signature of BOTH parties . Most government applications only have the signature 39 of the submitter and not the government, for instance. 40 2. Either party to the contract had no authority or delegated authority to bind the party they were representing. For 41 instance, no one in the government other than the legislative branch can obligate the government to do anything. A 42 contract with the government would be invalid and unenforceable if someone in the e xecutive branch signed or 43 represented his or her consent to the contract. 44   1 Brown v.

A party who make s a contract with an officer [of the government] 1 without having it reduced to writing is knowingly accessory to a violation of duty on his part. Such a party 2 aids in the violation of the law. \" 3 [Clark v. United States, 95 U.S. 539 (1877) ] 4 3. There was no mutual assent or understanding of the terms of the contract or franchise. For instance: 5 3.1. The terms on the government form or contract were not defined wi thin anything that constitutes evidence. The 6 entire Internal Revenue Code, for instance, is “prima facie evidence” according to 1 U.S.C. §204 . Consequently, 7 it is nothing more than a “presumption”. Presum ptions are NOT evidence, it is a violation of due process of law 8 to treat them as evidence, and judges have no delegated authority to turn them into evidence. If a judge turns a 9 presumption into evidence, he is, in fact, establishing a state sponsored rel igion in violation of the First 10 Amendment establishment clause: 11 presumption . An inference in favor of a particular fact. [. . .] 12 A presumption is an assumption of fact that the law requires to be made from another fact or group of facts 13 found or otherwis e established in the action. A presumption is not evidence. A presumption is either 14 conclusive or rebuttable. Every rebuttable presumption is either (a) a presumption affecting the burden of 15 producing evidence or (b) a presumption affecting the burden of proof. Calif.Evid.Code, §600. 16 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p . 1185 ] 17 __________________________________________________________________________________________ 18 This court has never treated a presumption as any form of evidence. See, e.g., A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. 19 Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F.2d 1020, 1037 (Fed.Cir.1992) (“[A] presumption is not evidence.”); see also Del 20 Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U.S. 280, 286, 56 S.Ct. 190, 193, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935) (“[A presumption] cannot 21 acquire the attribute of evidence in the claimant's favor.”); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gamer, 303 U.S. 161, 171, 22 58 S.Ct. 500, 503, 82 L.Ed. 726 (1938) (“[A] presumption is not evidence and may not be given weight as 23 evidence.”). Although a decision of this court, Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1415 (Fed.Cir.1994) , dealing 24 with presumptions in VA law is cited for the contrary proposition, the Jensen court did not so decide. 25 [Routen v.

One or both parties defined the terms that were not defined and those definitions conflict with the definitions 36 understood by the other party. For instance, the following form on our website defines many of the terms on 37 government tax forms to be the OPPOSITE of what the code says, and thereby invalidates the enforceability of 38 the “trade or business” f ranchise/contract that is the heart of the income tax: 39 Tax Form Attachment , Form #04.201 http://sedm.org/Forms/Form Index.htm 4. Your right to receive the “consideration” connected with the contract is not enforceable in court.

Is it meant that when a person lends money to a State, or to a municipal 7 division of the State having the power of taxation, there is in the contract a tacit reser vation of a right in the 8 debtor to raise contributions out of the money promised to be paid before payment? That cannot be, because if 9 it could, the contract (in the language of Alexander Hamilton) would 'involve two contradictory things: an 10 obligation to do, and a right not to do; an obligation to pay a certain sum, and a right to retain it in the shape 11 of a tax. It is against the rules, both of law and of reason, to admit by implication in the construction of a 12 contract a principle which goes in destruction of it.' The truth is, States and cities, when they borrow money 13 and contract to repay it with interest, are not acting as sovereignties . They come down to the level of ordinary 14 individuals. Their contracts have the same meaning as that of similar contra cts between private persons. 15 Hence, instead of there being in the undertaking of a State or city to pay, a reservation of a sovereign right to 16 withhold payment, the contract should be regarded as an assurance that such a right will not be exercised. A 17 prom ise to pay, with a reserved right to deny or change the effect of the promise, is an absurdity.\" 18 [Murray v. City of Charleston, 96 U.S. 432 (1877) ] 19 Likewise, any transaction that does not involve REAL consideration is also voidable. An example of a voidable contract is 20 one in which the transaction was between one or more private persons and the alleged consideration involves Federal 21 Reser ve Notes . Federal Reserve Notes do NOT constitute legitimate consideration because: 22 1. Federal Reserve Notes are lawful money ONLY for PUBLIC debts, not private debts. 23 2. Federal Reserve Notes are nowhere defined in the law as a species of “dollar”, nor are they THE dollar mentioned in 24 the constitution. See: 25 SEDM Exhibit #06 . 007 http://sedm.org/Exhibits/ExhibitIndex.htm 3. Federal Reserve Notes are not redeemable from the government for anything of value. Redeemability ended in 1972. 26 Beyond that point, there is no real consideration involved in the transaction and our money system becomes nothing 27 but a big counterfeiting franchise where the government has a monopoly on counterfeiting. 28 4. Federal Reserve Notes are legally defined as promissory notes, and the definition of “money” in Black’s Law 29 Dictionary EXCLUDES “notes”: 30 Money : In usual and ordinary acceptation it means coins and paper currency used as circulating medium of 31 exchange, and does not embrace notes , bonds, evidences of debt, or other personal or real 32 estate.

The “statutory or decisional 27 law” the court is referring to is, in fact, the civil law that regulates those who consent to the contract or franchise and 28 therefore are subject to it : 29 “One great object of the Constitution is to permit citizens to structure their private relations as they choose 30 subject only to the constraints of statutory or decisional law . [500 U.S. 614, 620] 31 To implement these principles, courts must consider fro m time to time where the governmental sphere [e.g. 32 “public purpose” and “public office”] ends and the private sphere begins. Although the conduct of private 33 parties lies beyond the Constitution's scope in most instances, governmental authority may dominate an 34 activity to such an extent that its participants must be deemed to act with the authority of the government 35 and, as a result, be subject to constitutional constraints. This is the jurisprudence of state action, which 36 explores the \"essential dichotomy\" between the private sphere and the public sphere, with all its attendant 37 constitutional obligations.

Although we have recognized that this 42 aspect of the analysis is often a fact -bound inquiry, see Lugar, supra, 457 U.S. at 939, our cases disclose 43 certain principles of general application. Our precedents establish that, in determining whether a particular 44 action or course of conduct is governmental in character, it is relevant to examine the following: the extent 45 to which the actor relies on governmental assistance and benefits, see Tulsa Professional Collection Services, 46 Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) ; Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715 (1961) ; whethe r 47 the actor is performing a traditional governmental function, see Terry v.

Benefits an d franchises are called “public rights” by the courts because they convey rights to one or more of the 6 participants and all those who participate take on a “public character” and become part of the machinery and operations 7 of the government in one way or a nother : 8 “The distinction between public rights [franchises] and private rights [Constitutional rights] has not been 9 definitively explained in our precedents. 14 Nor is it necessary to do so in the present cases, for it suffices to 10 observe that a matter of pu blic rights must at a minimum arise “between the government and others.” Ex parte 11 Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451, 49 S.Ct., at 413. 15 In contrast, “the liability of one individual to another under the 12 law as defined,” Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292, is a matter of private rights. Our precedents 13 clearly establish that only controversies in the former category may be removed from Art. III courts and 14 delegated to legislative courts or administrative agencies for their determination. See Atlas Roofing Co. v. 15 Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U.S. 442, 450, n. 7, 97 S.Ct. 1261, 1266, n. 7, 51 16 L.Ed.2d 464 (197 7); Crowell v. Benson, supra, 285 U.S., at 50 -51, 52 S.Ct., at 292. See also Katz , Federal 17 Legislative Courts, 43 Harv.L.Rev. 894, 917 -918 (1930) .FN24 Private- rights disputes, on the other hand, lie 18 at the core of the historically recognized judicial power.” 19 [. . .] 20 Although Crowell and Raddatz do not explicitly distinguish between rights created by Congress and other 21 rights, such a distinction unde rlies in part Crowell 's and Raddatz ' recognition of a critical difference between 22 rights created by federal statute and rights recognized by the Constitution. Moreover, such a distinction seems 23 to us to be necessary in light of the delicate accommodatio ns required by the principle of separation of powers 24 reflected in Art. III. The constitutional system of checks and balances is designed to guard against 25 “encroachment or aggrandizement” by Congress at the expense of the other branches of government. Buckley 26 v. Valeo , 424 U.S., at 122, 96 S.Ct., at 683. But when Congress creates a statutory right [a “privilege” in this 27 case, such as a “trade or business”], it clearly has the discretion, in defining that right, to create presumptions, 28 or assign burdens of proof, or prescribe remedies; it may also provide that persons seeking to vindicate that 29 right must do so before particularized tribunals created to perform the specialized adju dicative tasks related to 30 that right. FN35 Such provisions do, in a sense, affect the exercise of judicial power, but they are also incidental 31 to Congress' power to define the right that it has created. No comparable justification exists, however, when the 32 right being adjudicated is not of congressional creation. In such a situation, substantial inroads into functions 33 that have traditionally been performed by the Judiciary cannot be characterized merely as incidental extension s 34 of Congress' power to define rights that it has created. Rather, such inroads suggest unwarranted 35 encroachments upon the judicial power of the United States, which our Constitution reserves for Art. III courts. 36 [Northern Pipeline Cons t. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858 (1983) ] 37 Note based on the above that participation in benefits and franchises can cause you to surrender your right to hear 38 disputes in a real, constitutional court in the judicial branch. Instead, Congress can write or revise the franchise 39 agreement at any time without your consent, without noticing you, and without involving you to add any of the 40 following deprivations of rights and you don’t have a thing you can do but quit the program because they will treat 41 their RIGHT to do this as part of t he consideration for your participation in the program! 42 1.1. To create legislative franchise courts in the legislative rather than judicial branch . 43   14 Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) , attempted to catalog some of the matters that fall within the public- rights doctrine: “Familiar illustrations of administrative agencies created for the determination of such matters are found in connection with the exercise of the congressional power as to interstate and foreign commerce, taxation, immigration, the public lands, public health, the facilities of the post office, pensions and payments to veterans.” Id. , at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292 (footnote omitted). 15 Congress cannot “withdraw from [ Art. III] judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature , is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. , 18 How. 272, 284 (1856) (emphasis added). It is thus clear that the presence of the United States as a proper party to the proceeding is a necessary but not suf ficient means of distinguishing “private rights” from “public rights.” And it is also clear that even with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the “public rights” doctrine, the presump tion is in favor of Art. III courts. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok , 370 U.S., at 548 -549, and n. 21, 82 S.Ct., at 1471- 1472, and n. 21 (opinion of Harlan, J.). See also Currie, The Federal Courts and the American Law Institute, Part 1, 36 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 13 -14, n. 67 (1968).

A for eign corporation is one which is not domestic. A 24 domestic corporation is a resident corporation even though it does no business and owns no property in the 25 United States. A foreign corporation engaged in trade or business within the United States is referr ed to in 26 the regulations in this chapter as a resident foreign corporation, and a foreign corporation not engaged in 27 trade or business within the United States, as a nonresident foreign corporation. A partnership engaged in 28 trade or business within the United States is referred to in the regulations in this chapter as a resident 29 partnership, and a partnership not engaged in trade or business within the United States, as a nonresident 30 partnership. Whether a partnership is to be regarded as resident or nonres ident is not determined by the 31 nationality or residence of its members or by the place in which it was created or organized. 32 [Amended by T.D. 8813, Federal Register: February 2, 1999 (Volume 64, Number 21), Page 4967- 4975] 33 [SOURCE: http://famguardian.org/TaxFreedom/CitesByTopic/Resident- 26cfr301.7701- 5.pdf ] 34 3.

This is not legislation. It is a decree 6 under legislative forms. 7 Nor is it taxation. ‘A tax,’ says Webster’s Dictionary, ‘is a rate or sum of money assessed on the person or 8 property of a citizen by go vernment for the use of the nation or State.’ ‘Taxes are burdens or charges 9 imposed by the Legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes.’ Cooley, Const. 10 Lim., 479 . 11 Coulter, J., in Northern Liberties v.

Benefits and franchises can only be offered to those domiciled within the exclusive and not special jurisdiction of the 32 grantor.

All franchises are contracts, and therefore are also property as legally defined. 32 As a rule, franchises spring from contracts between the sovereign power and private citizens , made upon 33 valuable considerations, for purposes of individual advantage as well as public benefit, 18 and thus a franchise 34 partakes of a doubl e nature and character. So far as it affects or concerns the public, it is publici juris and is 35 subject to governmental control. The legislature may prescribe the manner of granting it, to whom it may be 36 granted, the conditions and terms upon which it may be held, and the duty of the grantee to the public in 37 exercising it, and may also provide for its forfeiture upon the failure of the grantee to perform that duty. But 38 when granted, it becomes the property of the grantee, and is a private right, subject only to the governmental 39 control growing out of its other nature as publici juris. 19 40 [Am.Jur.2d, Franchises, §4: Generally ] 41 The collection of all rights and ther efore property associated with a franchise or contract collectively is called the “res”: 42 \"Res .

It is a decree 3 under legislative forms. 4 Nor is it taxation. ‘A tax,’ says Webster’s Dictionary, ‘is a rate or sum of money assessed on the per son or 5 property of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or State.’ ‘Taxes are burdens or charges 6 imposed by the Legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes.’ Cooley, Const. 7 Lim., 479 . 8 Coulter, J., in Northern Liberties v. St. John’s Church, 13 Pa. St., 104 says , very forcibly, ‘I think the common 9 mind has everywhere taken in the understanding that taxes are a public imposition, levied by authority of the 10 government for the purposes of carrying on the government in all its machinery and operations —that they 11 are imposed for a public purpose. ’ See, also Pray v. Northern Liberties, 31 Pa.St., 69 ; Matter of Mayor of 12 N.Y., 11 Johns., 77 ; Camden v. Allen, 2 Dutch., 398 ; Sharpless v. Mayor, supra; Hanson v. Vernon, 27 Ia., 47 ; 13 Whiting v. Fond du Lac, supra.” 14 [Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655 (1874) ] 15 3. A private citizen serving in a public office without the proper lawful authority. A ll “taxpayers” under the Internal 16 Revenue Code, Subtitle A , for instance, are “public officers”. This public office is called a “trade or business” and is 17 defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26) as “the functions of a public office”. Only lawfully elected public officers can 18 lawfully execute the functions of a public office. 19 4. An information return such as IRS Forms W -2, 1042- S, 1098, and 1099 being filed against a nyone who is NOT 20 lawfully engaged in a “public office” within the government. 21 4.1. This is a crime under : 22 4.1.1. 18 U.S.C. §912 : Impersonating a “public officer” in the government 23 4.1.2. 26 U.S.C. §7206 : False statements 24 4.1.3. 26 U.S.C. §7207 : Fraudulent returns (information returns), statements, or other documents. 25 4.2. It is a c ivil tort pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §7434 . 26 4.3. The effect of the false report is to unlawfully convert private property to a public office without compensation. 27 There are only two instances where private property can be taken without compensation, which is if the owner 28 voluntarily donates it to a public use or if he uses it to commit a crime and thereby hurts some one with it. For 29 instance, when someone abuses their liberty and their life, which are property, to kill someone, the state asserts 30 eminent domain against their entire person and places them in jail, convicts them with a jury full of public 31 officers, and places them in a public building called a prison for storage as “public property”. 32 The purpose of a public officer is to manage public property. This is confirmed by the definition of “public office”: 33 “ Public office . The right, authority, and duty created and conferred by law, by which for a given period, either 34 fixed by law or enduring at the pleasure of the creating power, an individual is invested with some portion of 35 the sovereign functions of government for the benefit of the public. Walker v. Rich, 7 9 Cal.App. 139, 249 P. 56, 36 58. An agency for the state, the duties of which involve in their performance the exercise of some portion of the 37 sovereign power, either great or small. Yaselli v.

State, 61 Cal.App. 377, 214 P. 1030, 1035; Shelmadine v. 39 City of Elkhart, 75 1nd.App. 493, 129 N.E. 878. State ex rel. Colorado River Commission v. Frohmiller, 46 40 Ariz. 413, 52 P.2d 483, 486. Where, by virtue of law, a person is clothed, not as an incidental or transient 41 authority, but for such time as de- notes duration and continuance, with Independent power to control the 42 property of the public , or with public functions to be exercised in the supposed interest of the people, the 43 service to be compensated by a stated yearly salary, and the occupant having a designation or title, the position 44 so created is a public office. State v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St. 33. 29 N.E. 593. 45 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 1235 ] 46 The “property ” managed by the public officer, in the case of the Internal Revenue Code, Subtitle A “trade or business’ 47 franc hise, is all the private property donated to a “public use”, a “public purpose”, and a “public office” by voluntarily 48 connecting it with the de facto license number called a “Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)”, which is itself is also 49 public property. That number, like the formerly private property it attaches to, MUST be public property if it can be used 50 to penalize those who use it or abuse it. 51 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happin ess;' 52 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 53 man has honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 54 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does not mean that he must use it for his neighbor's benefit; second, 55 that if he devotes it to a public use [by associating it with a franchise or 56"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 36 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ “public right” using a de facto license number] , he gives to the public a 1 right to control tha t use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it 2 upon payment of due compensation. 3 [Budd v. People of State of New York, 143 U.S. 517 (1892) ] 4 The conversion of private property to a public use, public purpose, and public office can only lawfully be made by the 5 owner and if a third party does it without the consent of the owner, theft has occu rred. One of the important purposes of 6 government is to keep private property separate from public property so as to protect private property . A government that 7 can’t or won’t protect you from theft by itself certainly does not deserve the additional job of protecting you from theft by 8 others , whether under the guise of police powers or not . Consequently, when private property is associated with public 9 property such as a “Taxpayer Identification Number” , one of the two must change character or an unlawful conversion has 10 occurred . It is embezzlement to convert public property into private property or to use public property for a private use or 11 benefit of any kind. T herefore the only type of conversion that can lawfully occur when such an association happens is that 12 the private property so associated is converted to a public use, a public purpose, and a public office and you as the former 13 owner the n become the person designated to manage the public property so converted as a “public officer” and straw man 14 acting as a fiduciary, trustee, and transferee on behalf of the government pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §§6901 and 6903 . 15 The only person who can lawfully supervise “public officers” in admin ist ering th e property donated to the public office 16 franchise then is the courts. The nature of being a “public officer” is, in fact, that the only superior authority is the law 17 itself. The courts are the only ones who can enforce the laws that regulate t he conduct of public officers. All federal 18 district and circuit courts are created as territorial “property” or “franchise” courts whose sole purpose is to supervise the 19 management of all community property of the states of the Union pursuant to Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. 20 Constitution. The collection of all such community property under the management of these courts is what the Supreme 21 Court calls “the nati onal domain”. 22 “The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.’ 23 Every journey to a forbidden end begins with the first step; and the danger of such a step by the federal 24 government in the direction of taking over the powers of the states is that the end of the journey may find the 25 states so despoiled of their powers, or -what may amount to the same thing -so *296 relieved of the 26 responsibilities which possession of the powers necessarily enjoins, a s to reduce them to little more than 27 geographical subdivisions of the national domain. It is safe to say that if, when the Constitution was under 28 consideration, it had been thought that any such danger lurked behind its plain words, it would never have bee n 29 ratified. 30 [Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855 (U.S. 1936) ] 31 Consistent with the a bove, w e would argue that the effect of courts sanctioning or allowing federal franchises to be 32 enforced or permitted within the boundaries of a sovereign state of the Union is a usurpation which: 33 1. Makes rights guaranteed by the Constitution no longer UNALIENABLE. An “unalienable” right is one that cannot be 34 sole, bargained away, or transferred to the government by ANY method, including the authority of law and especially 35 by the mechanism of franchises: 36 “Unalienable. Inalienable; incapable of being aliened, that is, sold and transferred.” 37 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 1693 ] 38 2. Destroys the separation of powers between the Judicial an d the Legislative branches. A franchise court is not in the 39 Judicial Branch of the government, but rather within the Legislative Branch as a legislative “franchise court”. In fact, 40 the only remaining true, Article III constitutional Court is the U.S. Sup reme Court acting only within its original 41 jurisdiction. See the following for an exhaustive analysis of this corruption of our court system: 42 What Happened to Justice? , Form #06.012 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 3. Makes justice in the federal courts impossible, if the very judges who hear the cases are participating in the franchise at 43 issue. 28 U.S.C. §144 and 28 U.S.C. §455 mandate that judges cannot hear cases that they have a personal interest in, 44 which means that a judge cannot be a “taxpayer” f ranchisee and receive “benefits” paid for with taxes, and at the same 45 time objectively hear an income tax case. 46 \"And you shall take no bribe , for a bribe blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous .\" 47 [Exodus 23:8 , Bible, NKJV] 48"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 37 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ \"He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, 1 But he who hates bribes will live .\" 2 [Prov. 15:27, Bible, NKJV] 3 \"Surely oppression destroys a wise man's reason. 4 And a bribe debases the hea rt .\" 5 [Ecclesiastes 7:7 , Bible, NKJV] 6 4. Destroys the separation of powers between the states and federal government. 7 “Thus, Congress having power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and 8 with the Indian tribes, may, without doubt, provide for granting coasting licenses , licenses to pilots, licenses to 9 trade with the Indians, and any other licenses necessary or proper for the exercise of that great and extensive 10 power; and the same observation is applicable to every other power of Congress, to the exercise of which the 11 granting of licenses may be incident. All such licenses confer authority, and give rights to the licensee. 12 But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States . Over this 13 commerce and trade Congress has no power of regulation nor any direct control . This power belongs 14 exclusively to the States. No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted w ithin a State is 15 warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental to the exercise of powers clearly granted to 16 the legislature . The power to authorize a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the exclusive power of 17 the State over the same subject. It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very extensive power. It is given 18 in the Constitution, with only one exception and only two qualifications. Congress cannot tax exports, and it 19 must impose direct taxes by the rule of a pportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule of uniformity. Thus limited, 20 and thus only, it reaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion. But, it reaches only existing 21 subjects. Congress cannot authorize [e.g. license or enforce] a trade or business [or any type of franchise] 22 within a State in order to tax it.” 23 [License Tax Cases, 72 U.S. 462 , 18 L.Ed. 497, 5 Wall. 462, 2 A.F.T.R. 2224 (1866) ] 24 5. Reduces states to little more than federal corporations and federal te rritories nearly wholly owned and controlled by the 25 general government as indicated in Carter v. Carter Coal Company above. 26 6. Places those in the national government into a state of conflicting allegiances, whereby they are tasked with protecting 27 constituti onal rights on the one hand, and yet on the other hand devot ing all their time to setting up businesses and 28 franchises outside their civil jurisdiction in a foreign state called a state of the Union that DESTROY rights in order to 29 maximize their retirement check and “benefits”. This is a violation of 18 U.S.C. §208. The love of money will always 30 win out over the love of justice, truth, and mercy. 31 7. Violate s the mandate of Constitution Article 4, Section 4 to protect every state from invasion by either other states of 32 the federal government. Any attempt to destroy rights, and especially through compelled participation in franchises, is 33 an invasio n in every sense of the word, even though not a physical or military invasion. 34 U.S. Constitution 35 Article 4, Section 4. 36 The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall 37 protect each of them against Invasion ; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the 38 Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. 39 Who is doing the “invading”? How about vultures in the monopoly that the ABA has on offices within the 40 government. This monopoly has made justice into a luxury and turned government into a state sponsored religion. 41 The judges are the priests of this civil religion and the franchises they administer are the “bibles”. Franchisees are the 42 members of the pagan religion.

Namely, they: 1 1. Involve commercial activity of some kind . A specific commercial activity such as the following forms the ba sis for the 2 consideration that makes the contract or agreement binding. 3 1.1. Receipt of a government financial “benefit”. 4 1.2. Payment of monies to the government or to entities working for the government. 5 2. Involve a gency . The franchise is represented by a “public o ffice” within the government called “person” which is the 6 “res” or subject of the franchise agreement. You become the surety for the “public office” and a “trustee” of the 7 “public trust” as a franchisee. Most franchises also constitute a trust indenture in which you become the trustee of the 8 public trust and a “public officer” by signing up for the franchise . 9 “As expressed otherwise, the powers delegated to a public officer are held in trust for the people and are to be 10 exercised in behalf of the government or of all citizens who may need the intervention of the officer. 20 11 Furthermore, the view has been expressed that all public officers, within whatever branch and whatever level 12 of government, and whatever be their private vocations, are trustees of the people, and accordingly labor 13 under every disability and prohibition imposed by law upon trustees relative to the making of personal 14 financial gain from a discharge of their trusts . 21 That is, a public officer occupies a fiduciary relationship 15 to the political entity on whose behalf he or she serves. 22 and owes a fiduciary duty to the public. 23 It has 16 been said that the fiduciary responsibilities of a public officer cannot be less than those of a private 17 individual. 24 Furthermore, it has been stated that any enterprise undertaken by the public official which tends 18 to weaken public confidence and undermine the sense of security for individual rights is against public 19 policy. 25 ” 20 [63C Am.Jur.2d, Public Officers and Employees, §247 ] 21 3. Make a specific type of property transfer lawful that was not previously lawful . That type of transfer is one of the 22 following: 23 3.1. The conversion of private property into a public use, public purpose, or “public office”. Such a conversion is 24 otherwise a crime called “conversion” which is documented in 18 U.S.C. §654. All franchise agreements 25 authorize control by the government over s ome type of formerly private property and that control becomes the 26 consideration that the government receives for consenting to allow you to participate and receive the government 27 “benefits”. 28 3.2. The payment of public funds and tax monies to private persons wh o are not working for the government and who 29 provided no consideration in return . In other words, the government cannot abuse its taxing power to transfer 30 wealth between private persons and thereby act as a Robin Hood. If it does, it is violating the req uirement for 31 equal protection that is the foundation of the Constitution as well as becoming a THIEF. 32 3.3. Payment of monies to the government. It is illegal to bribe a public official. 18 U.S.C. §201. Monie s paid to the 33 government by private persons in the guise of “social insurance” premiums are a bribe to a public official if paid 34 by a private person, but suddenly become lawful if the payor is another public official and he is compensating the 35 government f or a deferred retirement benefit as “federal personnel” such as that described in 5 U.S.C. 36 §552a(a)(13). 37 Examples of franchises that constitute “public offices” include: 38   20 State ex rel.

He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond 16 the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to 17 the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the 18 Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his 19 property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law.

Consequently, they had to invent a legal 4 “person” who is one of their officers or agents within a franchise agreement that they could impose the duties against, and 5 then fool you into becoming that per son. 6 The Thirteenth Amendment outlaws what it calls “involuntary servitude” in the case of only natural beings. It does not 7 protect artificial entities, corporations, or other creations of government: 8 United States Constitu tion 9 Thirteenth Amendment - Slavery And Involuntary Servitude 10 Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party 11 shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. 12 Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 13 The Thirteenth Amendment applies EVERYWHERE, including on federal territory: 14 “That it does not conflict with the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, 15 except as a punishment for crime, is too clear for argument. Slavery implies involuntary servitude— a state of 16 bondage; the ownership of mankind as a chattel, or at least the control of the labor and services of one man 17 for the benefit of another, and the absence of a legal right to the disposal of his own person, property, and 18 services [in their entirety]. This amendment was said in the Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall, 36, to have been 19 intended primarily to abolish slavery, as it had been previously known in this country, and that it equally 20 forbade Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie trade, when they amounted to slavery or involuntary servitude 21 and that the use of the word ‘servitude’ was intended to prohibit the use of all forms of involuntary slavery, of 22 whatever class or name.” 23 [Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 542 (1896) ] 24 “Other authorities to the same effect might be cited. It is not open to doubt that Congress may enforce the 25 Thirteenth Amendment by direct legislation, punishing the holding of a person in slavery or in involuntary 26 servitude except as a punishment for a crime. In the exercise of that power Congress has enacted these sections 27 denouncing peonage, and punishing one who holds another in that condition of involuntary servitude. This 28 legislation is not limited to the territories or other parts of the strictly national domain, but is operative in the 29 states and wherever the sovereignty of the United States extends. We entertain no doubt of the validity of this 30 legislation, or of its applicability to the case of any person holding another in a state of peonage, and this 31 whether there be municipal ordinance or state law sanctioning such holding. It operates directly on every 32 citizen of the Republic, wherever his residence may be. ” 33 [Clyatt v.

This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to 21 close the circle of our felicities.\" 22 [Thomas Jefferson: 1st Inaugural, 1801. ME 3:320 ] 23 Governments know the above and take it into account in every law they write law in order to prevent violati ons of the 24 Thirteenth Amendment. They do this by: 25 1. Choosing a definition for “person” that excludes natural beings protected by the Thirteenth Amendment. 26 2. Ensuring that all natural beings who might fit the definition of “person” within the statute have to manifest consent in 27 some form in order to become subject to the statute. That consent might come in any of the following forms: 28 2.1. Applying for a license. 29 2.2. Filling out an application for “benefits”. 30 2.3. Receiving a specific “benefit” of a government franchise. 31 2.4. Entering into government service or employment. 32 2.5. Engaging in contracts with the government. 33 3. Placing war nings on the instruments by which the benefits of government franchises are conveyed to the natural being. 34 For instance, the Social Security Card acts as a “de facto license” to engage in a government franchise. It contains the 35 following warning on the back, which gives “reasonable notice” to all those in possession of it that they are party to a 36 government franchise and that they have forfeited the protections of the Thirteenth Amendment and agree to act as a 37 fiduciary, trustee, and transferee over said property: 38 “Improper use of this card or number by anyone is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both.” 39 If someone is trying to abuse the authority of civil law to impose a mandatory duty upon you, then the only kind of law they 40 can therefore be enforcing i s private or contract law to which you had to expressly consent at some point. That consent 41 could either be implicit (by your conduct) or explicit (in writing). Your reaction should always be to insist that they 42 produce evidence of your consent IN WRITIN G. This is similar to what the courts do in the case of the government, where 43 they can’t be sued or compelled to do anything without you producing an express waiver of sovereign immunity. They got 44 that authority and that sovereignty from you (!), because it was delegated to them by We The People, so you must ALSO 45 have sovereign immunity.

On this su bject, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the power to destroy, which includes the power to 3 impose slavery, must come from the same hand that created the thing to begin with.

The sovereign is completely 32 discharged from a duty, in the attemp ting to perform which he must always be exposed to innumerable 33 delusions, and for the proper performance of which no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient: 34 the duty of superintending the industry of private people. ” 35 [Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) ] 36 We will prove in this section that: 37 1. It is an abuse of the government’s ta xing power, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, to pay public monies to private 38 persons or to use the government’s taxing power to transfer wealth between groups of private individuals. 39 2. Because of these straight jacket constraints of the use of “public fu nds” by the government, the government can only 40 lawfully make payments or pay “benefits” to persons who have contracted with them to render specific services that 41 are authorized by the Constitution to be rendered. 42 3. The government had to create an intermedia ry called the “straw man” that is a public office or agent within the 43 government and therefore part of the government that they could pay the “benefit” to in order to circumvent the 44 restrictions upon the government from abusing its powers to transfer wealt h between private individuals. 45 The U.S. Supreme Court has said many times that the ONLY purpose for lawful, constitutional taxation is to collect 46 revenues to support ONLY the machinery and operations of the government and its “employees”.

St., 104 says , very forcibly, ‘I think the common 17 mind has everywhere taken in the understanding that taxes are a public imposition, levied by authority of the 18 government for the purpo ses of carrying on the government in all its machinery and operations —that they 19 are imposed for a public purpose. ’ See, also Pray v. Northern Liberties, 31 Pa.St., 69 ; Matter of Mayor of 20 N.Y., 11 Johns., 77 ; Camden v. Allen, 2 Dutch., 398 ; Sharpless v. Mayor, supra; Hanson v. Vernon, 27 Ia., 47 ; 21 Whiting v.

The word has never thought to connote the expropriation of money from one group 26 for the benefit of another.\" 27 [U.S. v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936 )] 28 Black’s Law Dictionary defines the word “public purpose” as follows: 29 “ Public purpose . In the law of taxation, eminent domain, etc., this is a term of classification to distinguish the 30 objects for which, accord ing to settled usage, the government is to provide, from those which, by the like usage, 31 are left to private interest, inclination, or liberality. The constitutional requirement that the purpose of any tax, 32 police regulation, or particular exertion of the power of eminent domain shall be the convenience, safety, or 33 welfare of the entire community and not the welfare of a specific individual or class of persons [such as, for 34 instance, federal benefit recipients as individuals] . “Public purpose” that will justify expenditure of public 35 money generally means such an activity as will serve as benefit to community as a body and which at same time 36 is directly related function of government. Pack v. Southwestern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 215 Tenn. 503, 387 37 S.W.2d 789, 794. 38 The term is synonymous with governmental purpose. As employed to denote the objects for which taxes may be 39 levied, it has no relation to the urgency of the public need or to the extent of the public benefit which is to 40 follow; the essential requisite being that a public service or use shall affect the inhabitants as a community, 41 and not merely as individuals. A public purpose or public business has for its objective the promotion of the 42 public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, and contentment of all the inhabitants or 43 residents within a given political division, as, for example, a state, the sovereign powers of which are exercised 44 to promote such public purpose or public business.” 45 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1231, Emphasis added] 46 A related word defined in Black’s Law Dictionary is “public use”: 47 Public use . Eminent domain. The constitutional and statutory basis for taking property by eminent domain. 48 For condemnation purposes, \"public use\" is one which confers some benefit or advantage to the public; it is not 49 confined to actual use by public. It is measured in terms of right of public to use proposed facilities for which 50 condemnation is sought and, as long as public has right of use, whether exercised by one or many members of 51 public, a \"public advantage\" or \"public benefit\" accrues sufficient to constitute a public use. Montana Power 52 Co. v. Bokma, Mont., 457 P.2d 769, 772, 773. 53 Public use, in constitutional provisions restricting the exercise of the right to take property in virtue of eminent 54 domain, means a use concerning the whole community distinguished from particular individuals. But each and 55 every member of society need not be equally interested in such use, or be personally and directly affected by it; 56 if the object is to satisfy a great public want or exigency, that is sufficient. Ringe Co. v. Los Angeles County, 262 57 U.S. 700, 43 S.Ct. 689, 692, 67 L.Ed. 1186.

The objective in assessing the tax is to generate revenue to be used for the needs of the 12 public. 13 A pecuniary [relating to money] burden laid upon individuals or property to support the government, and is a 14 payment exacted by legislative authority. In re Mytinger, D.C.Tex. 31 F.Supp. 977,978,979 .

Commission v. Patt, 4 19 Mich.App. 228, 144 N.W.2d 663, 665 . 20 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1457 ] 21 So in order to be legitimately called a “tax” or “taxation”, the money we pay to the government must fit all of the following 22 criteria: 23 1. The money must be used ONLY for the support of government. 24 2. The subject of the tax must be “liable”, and responsibl e to pay for the support of government under the force of law. 25 3. The money must go toward a “public purpose” rather than a “private purpose”. 26 4. The monies paid cannot be described as wealth transfer between two people or classes of people within society. 27 5. The m onies paid cannot aid one group of private individuals in society at the expense of another group, because this 28 violates the concept of equal protection of law for all citizens found in Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1. 29 If the monies demanded by government do not fit all of the above requirements, then they are being used for a “private” 30 purpose and cannot be called “taxes” or “taxation”, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. Actions by the government to 31 enforce the payment of any monies that do not meet all the above requirements can therefore only be described as: 32 1. Theft and robbery by the government in the guise of “taxation” 33 2. Government by decree rather than by law 34 3. Tyranny 35 4. Socialism 36 5.

Incidentally, the case below also forms the backbone of reasons why the 10 Internal Revenue Code can never be anything more than private law that only applies to those who volunteer into it: 11 “The Legislature may enjoin, permit, forbid, and punish; they may declare new crimes; and establish rules of 12 conduct for al l its citizens in future cases; they may command what is right, and prohibit what is wrong; but 13 they [the government] cannot change innocence [a “nontaxpayer”] into guilt [a “taxpayer”]; or punish 14 innocence as a crime [criminally prosecute a “nontaxpayer” for violation of the tax laws]; or violate the right 15 of an antecedent lawful private contract; or the right of private property. To maintain that our Federal, or 16 State, Legislature possesses such powers [of THEFT and FRAUD], if they had not been expressly restrained; 17 would, *389 in my opinion, be a political heresy, altogether inadmissible in our free republican 18 governments. ” 19 [Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386 (1798) ] 20 We also cannot assume or suppose that our government has the authority to make “gifts” of monies collected through its 21 taxation powers, and especially not when paid to private individuals or foreign countries because: 22 1. The Constitution DOES NOT authorize the govern ment to “gift” money to anyone within states of the Union or in 23 foreign countries, and therefore, this is not a Constitutional use of public funds, nor does unauthorized expenditure of 24 such funds produce a tangible public benefit, but rather an injury, by forcing those who do not approve of the gift to 25 subsidize it and yet not derive any personal benefit whatsoever for it. 26 2. The Supreme Court identifies such abuse of taxing powers as “robbery in the name of taxation” above. 27 Based on the foregoing analysis, we are then forced to divide the monies collected by the government through its taxing 28 powers into only two distinct classes. We also emphasize that every tax collected and every expenditure originating from 29 the tax paid MUST fit into one of the two categor ies below: 30 Table 1: Two methods for taxation 31 # Characteristic Public use/purpose Private use/purpose 1 Authority for tax U.S. Constitution Legislative fiat, tyranny 2 Monies collected described by Supreme Court as Legitimate taxa tion “Robbery in the name of taxation” (see Loan Assoc. v.

Tax becomes a means of “renting” what amounts to state property to private individuals for temporary use. The U.S. Supreme Court also helped to clarify how to disti nguish the two above categories when it said: 1 “It is undoubtedly the duty of the legislature which imposes or authorizes municipalities to impose a tax to see 2 that it is not to be used for purposes of private interest instead of a public use, and the courts can only be 3 justified in interposing when a violation of this principle is clear and the [87 U.S. 665] reason for interference 4 cogent. And in deciding whether, in the given case, the object for which the taxes are assessed falls upon the 5 one side or the other of this line, they must be governed mainly by the course and usage of the government, 6 the objects for which taxes have been customarily and by long course of legislation levied, what objects or 7 purposes have been considered necessary to the support a nd for the proper use of the government, whether 8 state or municipal. Whatever lawfully pertains to this and is sanctioned by time and the acquiescence of the 9 people may well be held to belong to the public use, and proper for the maintenance of good government, 10 though this may not be the only criterion of rightful taxation. ” 11 [Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655 (1874) ] 12 If we give our government the benefit of the doubt by “assuming” or “presuming” that it is operating lawfully and 13 consistent with the model on the left above, then we have no choice but to conclude that everyone who lawfully receives 14 any kind of federal payment MUST be either a federal “employee” or “federal contractor” on official duty, and that the 15 compensation received must be directly connected to the performance of a sovereign or Constitutionally authorized 16 function of government. Any other conclusion or characterization of a lawful tax other than this is irrational, inconsistent 17 with the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court on this subject, and an attempt to deceive the public about the role of limited 18 Constitutional government based on Republican principles. This means that you cannot participate in any of the following 19 federal social insurance programs WITHOUT being a federal “employee”, and if you refuse to identify your self as a federal 20 employee, then you are admitting that your government is a thief and a robber that is abusing its taxing powers: 21 1.

Records maintained on individuals 1 (a) Definitions. — For purposes of this section — 2 (2) the term “individual” means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent 3 residence; 4 The “citizen of the United States” they are talking above is based on the st atutory rather than constitutional definition of the 5 “United States”, which means it refers to the federal zone and excludes states of the Union. Also, note that both of the two 6 preceding definitions are found within Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which is ent itled “Government Organization and 7 Employees”. Therefore, it refers ONLY to government employees and excludes private employees. There is no definition 8 of the term “individual” anywhere in Title 26 (I.R.C.) of the U.S. Code or any other title that refers to private natural 9 persons, because Congress cannot legislative for them. Notice the use of the phrase “private business” in the U.S. Supreme 10 Court ruling below: 11 \"The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to car ry on his private 12 business in his own way [unregulated by the government] . His power to contract is unlimited.

He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond 15 the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to 16 the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the 17 Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his 18 property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public [including 19 so-called “taxes” under Subtitle A of the I.R.C.] so long as he does not trespass upon their rights. \" 20 [Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 , 74 (1906) ] 21 The purpose of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights instead is to REMOVE authority of the Congress to legislate for 22 private persons and thereby protect their sovereignty and dignity. That is why the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the following: 23 \"The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They 24 recogni zed the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a 25 part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things.

Congress must write laws to regulate and control every aspect of the behavior of its employees so 38 that they d o not adversely affect the rights of private individuals like you, who they exist exclusively to serve and protect. 39 Most federal statutes, in fact, are exclusively for use by those working in government and simply do not apply to private 40 citizens in the c onduct of their private lives. Federal law cannot apply to the private public at large because the Thirteenth 41 Amendment says that involuntary servitude has been abolished. If involuntary servitude is abolished, then they c an't use, or 42 in this case “abuse” the authority of law to impose ANY kind of duty against anyone in the private public except possibly 43 the responsibility to avoid hurting their neighbor and thereby depriving him of the equal rights he enjoys. 44 For the comma ndments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You 45 shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up 46 in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighb or as yourself.” 47 Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of [the ONLY requirement of] the law 48 [which is to avoid hurting your neighbor and thereby love him] . 49 [Romans 13:9- 10, Bible, NKJV] 50"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 52 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ 1 “Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm .” 2 [Prov. 3:30 , Bibl e, NKJV] 3 Thomas Jefferson, our most revered founding father, summed up this singular duty of government to LEAVE PEOPLE 4 ALONE and only interfere or impose a \"duty\" using the authority of law when and only when they are hurting each other in 5 order to protec t them and prevent the harm when he said. 6 \"With all [our] blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people?

ME 3:320 ] 12 The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed this view, when it ruled: 13 “The power to \"legislate generally upon\" life, liberty, and property, as opposed to the \"power to provide modes 14 of redress\" against offensive state action, was \"repugnant\" to the Constitution.

Although the specific holdings of these early cases might have been superseded or 17 modified, see, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964) ; United States v. Guest, 18 383 U.S. 745 (1966) , their treatment of Congress' §5 power as corrective or preventive, not definitional, has not 19 been questioned.” 20 [City of Boerne v. Florez, Archbishop of San Antonio, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) ] 21 What the U.S. Supreme Court is saying above is that the government has no authority to tell you how to run your private 22 life . This is contrary to the whole idea of the Internal Revenue Code, whose main purpose is to monitor and control every 23 aspect of those who are subject to it. In fact, it has become the chief means for Congress to implement what we call “social 24 engineering”. Just by the deductions they offer, people a re incentivized into all kinds of crazy behaviors in pursuit of 25 reductions in a liability that they in fact do not even have. Therefore, the only reasonable thing to conclude is that Subti tle 26 A of the Internal Revenue Code, which would “appear” to regulat e the private conduct of all individuals in states of the 27 Union, in fact only applies to federal instrumentalities or “public employees” in the official conduct of their duties on 28 behalf of the municipal corporation located in the District of Columbia, whi ch 4 U.S.C. § 72 makes the “seat of 29 government”. The I.R.C. therefore essentially amounts to a part of the job responsibility and the “employment contract” of 30 “public employees” and federal instrumentalities. This was also confirmed by the House of Representatives, who said that 31 only those who take an oath of “public office” are subject to the requirements of the personal income tax. See: 32 http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Taxes/Evidence/PublicOrPrivate -Tax -Return.pdf 33 Within the Internal Revenue Code , those legal “persons” who work for the government are identified as engaging in a 34 “public office”. A “public office” within the Internal Revenue Code is called a “trade or business”, which is defined below. 35 We emphasize that engaging in a privileged “trade or busin ess” is the main excise taxable activity that in fact and in deed is 36 what REALLY makes a person a “taxpayer” subject to the Internal Revenue Code, Subtitle A : 37 26 U.S.C.

The 27 ability to volunteer your private property for “public use”, by the way, also implies the ability to UNVOLUNTEER at any 28 time, which is the part no government employee we have ever found is willing to talk about. I wonder why....DUHHHH!: 29 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' 30 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 31 man has honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 32 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does not mean that he must use it for his neighbor's benefit; second, 33 that if he devotes it to a public use, he gives to the public a right to 34 control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it upon 35 payment of due compensation. 36 [Budd v. People of State of New York, 143 U.S. 517 (1892) ] 37 Any legal person, whether it be a natural person, a corporati on, or a trust, may become a “public office” if it volunteers to 38 do so. A subset of those engaging in such a “public office” are federal “employees”, but the term “public office” or “trade 39 or business” encompass much more than just government “employees”. In law, when a legal “person” volunteers to accept 40 the legal duties of a “public office”, it therefore becomes a “trustee”, an agent, and fiduciary (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 41 §6903 ) acting on behalf of the federal government by the operation of private contract law. It becomes essentially a 42 “franchisee” of the federal government carrying out the provisions of the franchise agreement, which is found in: 43 1. Internal Revenue Code, Subtitle A , in the case of the federal income tax. 44 2. The Social Security Act , which is found in Title 42 of the U.S. Code. 45 If you would like to learn more about how this “trade or business” scam works, consult the authoritative article below: 46 The “Trade or Business” Scam , Form #05.001 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm If you would like to know more about the extreme dangers of pa rticipating in all government franchises and why you 47 destroy ALL your Constitutional rights and protections by doing so, see: 48 1.

The Social Security Number is therefore the 14 equival ent of a “license number” to act as a “public officer” for the federal government, who is a fiduciary or trustee subject 15 to the plenary legislative jurisdiction of the federal government pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §7701 (a)(39) , 26 U.S.C. §7408 (c ) , 16 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 17 (b) , regardless of where he might be found geographical ly, including within a 17 state of the Union. The franchise agreement governs “choice of law” and where it’s terms may be litigated, which is the 18 District of Columbia, based on the agreement itself. 19 Now let’s apply what we have learned to your employment sit uation. God said you cannot work for two companies at 20 once. You can only serve one company, and that company is the federal government if you are receiving federal benefits: 21 “No one can serve two masters [two employers, for instance] ; for either he will hate the one and love the other, 22 or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon [government] .” 23 [Luke 16:13 , Bible, NKJV. Written by a tax collector] 24 Everything you ma ke while working for your slave master, the federal government, is their property over which you are a 25 fiduciary and “public officer”. 26 “THE” + “IRS” =”THEIRS” 27 A federal “public officer” has no rights in relation to their master, the federal government: 28 “Th e restrictions that the Constitution places upon the government in its capacity as lawmaker, i.e., as the 29 regulator of private conduct, are not the same as the restrictions that it places upon the government in its 30 capacity as employer. We have recognized this in many contexts, with respect to many different constitutional 31 guarantees. Private citizens perhaps cannot be prevented from wearing long hair, but policemen can. Kelley v. 32 Johnson, 425 U.S. 238, 247 (1976) . Private citizens cannot have their property searched without probable 33 cause , but in many circumstances government employees can. O’Connor v.

The 1040 return is a profit and loss statement for a federal business 5 corporation called the “United States”. You are in partnership with y our slave master and they decide what scraps they 6 want to throw to you in your legal “cage” AFTER they figure out whatever is left in financing their favorite pork barrel 7 project and paying off interest on an ever -expanding and endless national debt. Do y ou really want to reward this type of 8 irresponsibility and surety? 9 The W -4 therefore essentially amounts to a federal employment application. It is your badge of dishonor and a tacit 10 admission that you can’t or won’t trust God and yourself to provide for yourself. Instead, you need a corrupted “protector” 11 to steal money from your neighbor or counterfeit (print) it to help you pay your bills and run your life. Furthermore, if your 12 private employer forced you to fill out the Form W-4 against your will or instituted any duress to get you to fill it out, such 13 as threatening to fire or not hire you unless you fill it out, then he/she is: 14 1. Acting as an employment recruiter for the federal government. 15 2. Recruiting you into fed eral slavery in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment , and 42 U.S.C. §1994 . 16 3. Involved in a conspiracy to commit grand theft by stealing money from you to pay for services and protection you 17 don’t want and don’t need. 18 4. Involved in racketeering and extortion in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1951 . 19 5. Involved in money laundering for the federal government, by s ending in money stolen from you to them, in violation 20 of 18 U.S.C. §1956 . 21 The higher ups at the IRS probably know the above, and they certainly aren’t going to tell private employers or their 22 underlings the truth, because they aren’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth and don’t want to surrender their defense of 23 “plausible deniability”. They will NEVER tell a thief who is stealing for them that they are stealing, especially if they 24 don’t have to assume liability for the consequences of the theft. No one who practices this kind of slavery, deceit, and evi l 25 can rightly claim that they are loving their ne ighbor and once they know they are involved in such deceit, they have a duty 26 to correct it or become an “accessory after the fact” in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3 . This form of deceit is also the sin most 27 hated by God in the Bible. Below is a famous Bible commentary on Prov. 11:1 : 28 \"As religion towards God is a branch of universal righteousness (he is not an honest man that is not devout), so 29 righteousness towards men is a branch of true religion, for he is not a godly man that is not honest , nor can 30 he expect that his devotion should be accepted; for, 1. Nothing is more offensive to God than deceit in 31 commerce. A false balance is here put for all manner of unjust and fraudulent practices [of our public dis - 32 servants] in dealing with any perso n [within the public], which are all an abomination to the Lord, and 33 render those abominable [hated] to him that allow themselves in the use of such accursed arts of thriving. It 34 is an affront to justice, which God is the patron of, as well as a wrong to o ur neighbour, whom God is the 35 protector of. Men [in the IRS and the Congress] make light of such frauds, and think there is no sin in that 36 which there is money to be got by, and, while it passes undiscovered, they cannot blame themselves for it; a 37 blot is no blot till it is hit, Hos. 12:7, 8 . But they are not the less an abomination to God, who will be the 38 avenger of those that are defrauded by their brethren. 2. Nothing is more pleasing to God than fair and 39 ho nest dealing, nor more necessary to make us and our devotions acceptable to him: A just weight is his 40 delight. He himself goes by a just weight, and holds the scale of judgment with an even hand, and therefore is 41 pleased with those that are herein follower s of him. A balance cheats, under pretence of doing right most 42 exactly, and therefore is the greater abomination to God.\" 43 [Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible; Henry, M., 1996, c1991, under Prov. 11:1 ] 44 The Bible also says that those who participate in this kind of “commerce” with the government are practicing harlotry and 45 idolatry. The Bible book of Revelations describes a woman called “Babylon the Great Harlot”. 46 “And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and 47 ten horns. The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and 48 pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication. And on her 49 forehead a name was written: 50 MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOT S AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE 51 EARTH. 52"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 57 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw 1 her, I marveled with great amazement.” 2 [Rev. 17:3 -6 , Bible, NKJV] 3 This despicable harlot is described below as the “woman who sits on many waters”. 4 “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot [Babylon the Great Harlot] who sits on many waters, 5 with whom the kings of the earth [politicians and rulers] committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth 6 were made drunk [indulged] with the wine of her fornication.” 7 [Rev. 17:1 -2 , Bible, NKJV] 8 These waters are simply symbolic of a democracy controlled by mobs of atheistic people who are fornicating with the Beast 9 and who have ma de it their false, man -made god and idol: 10 “The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues.” 11 [Rev. 17:15 , Bible, NKJV] 12 The Beast is then defined in Rev. 19:19 as “the kings of the earth”, which today would be our political rulers: 13 “And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth , and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who 14 sat on the horse and against His army.” 15 [Rev. 19:19 , Bible, NKJV] 16 Babylon the Great Harlot is “fornicating” with the government by engaging in commerce with it. Black’s Law Dictionary 17 defines “commerce” as “intercourse”: 18 “ Commerce . ... Intercourse by way of trade and traffic between different peoples or states and the citizens or 19 inhabitants thereof, including not only the purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities, but also the 20 instrumentalities [governments] and agencies by which it is promoted and the means and appliances by which it 21 is carried on...” 22 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 269 ] 23 If you want your rights back people, you can’t pursue government employment in the context of your private job. If you 24 do, the Bible, not us, says you are a harl ot and that you are CONDEMNED to hell! 25 And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest 26 you receive of her plagues. For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. 27 Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she 28 has mixed, mix double for her. In the measure that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same 29 measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as queen, and am no widow, and will not 30 see sorrow.’ Therefore her plagues will come in one day— death and mourning and famine. And she will be 31 utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her. 32 [Rev. 18:4 -8 , Bible, NKJV] 33 In summary, it ought to be very clear from reading this section then, that: 34 1. It is an abuse of the government’s taxing power, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, to pay public monies to private 35 persons or to use the government’s taxing power to transfer wealth between groups of private individuals. 36 2. Because of these straight jacket constraints of the use o f “public funds” by the government, the government can only 37 lawfully make payments or pay “benefits” to persons who have contracted with them to render specific services that 38 are authorized by the Constitution to be rendered. 39 3. The government had to create a n intermediary called the “straw man” that is a public office or agent within the 40 government and therefore part of the government that they could pay the “benefit” to in order to circumvent the 41 restrictions upon the government from abusing its powers to tr ansfer wealth between private individuals. 42 4. The straw man is a “public office” within the U.S. government. It is a creation of Congress and an agent and fiduciary 43 of the government subject to the statutory control of Congress. It is therefore a public ent ity and not a private entity 44 which the government can therefore lawfully pay public funds to without abusing its taxing powers. 45 5. Those who sign up for government contracts, benefits, franchises, or employment agree to become surety for the straw 46 man or publ ic office and agree to act in a representative capacity on behalf of a federal corporation in the context of all 47 the duties of the office pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b) . 48"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 58 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ 6. Because the straw man is a public office, you can’t be compelled to occupy the office. You and not the government set 1 the compensation or amount of money you are willing to work for in order to consensually occupy the office. If you 2 don’t think the compensation is adequat e, you have the right to refuse to occupy the office by refusing to connect your 3 assets to the office using the de facto license number for the office called the Taxpayer Identification Number. 4 4.3 Government can’t lawfully maintain records on private persons without violating their 5 Fourth Amendment Rights 6 This section will prove that one of the main reasons that the straw man had to be created is so that the government could 7 keep records about you and use those records to tax and regulate what would otherwise be beyond their reach because 8 private . It is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to keep public records about private persons but the government has 9 always had the authority to keep public records about its own officers, employees, and agents. 10 The Fourth Amendment protects your right to privacy. In law, all rights, including your Fourth Amendment rights, are 11 “property” that cannot be taken from you by the government without violation of due process of law. 12 Property.

The highest right a man can 19 have to anything; being used to refer to that right which one has to lands or tenements, goods or chattels, which 20 no way depends on another man's courtesy. 21 The word is also commonly used to denote everything which is the subject of ownership, corporeal or 22 incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal, everything that has an exchangeable 23 value or which goes to make up wealth or estate. It extends to every species of valuable right and interest, and 24 includes real and personal property, easements, franchises, and incorporeal hereditaments, and includes 25 every invasion of one's property rights by actionable wrong.

The 43 government cannot therefore maintain records about you as a private person without invading your privacy and when they 44 do, they ne ed your permission to do so . Consequently, you must become a “public officer” or government agent or 45 “employee” in order for them to lawfully keep records about you or else they are violating your right to privacy.

Notwithstanding its duty to 'guarantee to every 16 state in this Union a republican form of government' (art. 4, 4), by which we understand, according to the 17 definition of Webster, 'a government in which the supreme power resides in the whole body of the people, 18 and is exercised by representatives elected by them,' Congress did not hesitate, in the original organization of 19 the territories of Louisiana, Florida, the Northwest Territory, and its subdivisions of Ohio, Indiana, 20 Michigan, Illinois, and Wiscons in and still more recently in the case of Alaska, to establish a form of 21 government bearing a much greater analogy to a British Crown colony than a republican state of America , 22 and to vest the legislative power either in a governor and council, or a govern or and judges, to be appointed by 23 the President. It was not until they had attained a certain population that power was given them to organize a 24 legislature by vote of the people. In all these cases, as well as in territories subsequently organized west of the 25 Mississippi, Congress thought it necessary either to extend to Constitution and laws of the United States over 26 them, or to declare that the inhabitants should be entitled to enjoy the right of trial by jury, of bail, and of the 27 privilege of the writ o f habeas corpus, as well as other privileges of the bill of rights.” 28 [Downes v.

Consequently, if the individual does not consent and notifies the agency of the 31 absence of consent , the records must destroy and no longer maintain the records. Every time we correspond with 32 the IRS, we tell them : 33 2.4.1. That we are not the “citizen” or “resid ent” named in the Privacy Act because not domiciled on federal 34 territory.

There is no statute authorizing requiring the disclosure of information about those who are private persons and not 41 officers , agents , or instrumentalities of the government or in receipt of public funds. 42 The gover nment can, however, maintain records on its own creations, such as its own employees, officers, agents, 43 instrumentalities, federal corporations, and federal franchises , and it can also lawfully impose record keeping requirements 44 upon these entities as well as a matter of public policy . It can also compel disclosure of information from such 45 instrumentalities and no Fifth Amendment privilege may be used to resist such compulsion. 46 “Incorporated [e.g. PUBLIC] banks, like other organizations, have no privilege against compulsory self- 47 incrimination, e.g., Hale v.

Shultz, 416 U.S. 21,29, 94 S.Ct. 1494 (U.S.Cal. 1974) ] 22 In order to help the government collect more taxes, the government ab used the leverage it had ov er the banks through the 23 FDIC insurance franchise to impose the duties of the Bank Secrecy Act upon them without compensation . In other words, 24 compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act became one form of “consideration ” that the ban ks had to pay for the “privilege” of 25 being FDIC insured. The FDIC franchise makes banks “agents” of the government.

They cite no cases for this proposition, and it does not 3 warrant extended treatment. In its complaint filed in the District Court, plaintiff Security National Bank 4 asserted that it was an ‘insured’ national bank; to the extent that Congress has acted to require records on 5 the part of banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or of financial institutions insured 6 under the National Housing Act, Congress is simply imposing a condition on the spending of public funds. 7 See, e.g., Steward Machine Co. v.

Since there was no allegation in the complaints filed 9 in the District Court, and since it is not contended here that any bank plaintiff is not covered by FDIC or 10 Housing Act insurance, it is unnecessary to consider what questions would arise had Congress relied solely 11 upon its power over interstate commerce to impose the recordkeeping requirements. The cost burdens 12 imposed on the banks by the recordkeeping requirements are far from unreasonable, and we hold that such 13 burdens do not deny the banks due process of law. FN22 14 FN22. The only figures in the record as to the cost burden placed on the banks by the recordkeeping 15 req uirements show that the Bank of America, one of the largest banks in the United States, with 997 branches, 16 $29 billion in deposits, and a net income in excess of $178 million (Moody's Bank and Finance Manual 633- 636 17 (1972) ), expended $392,000 in 1971, including start -up costs, to comply with the microfilming requirements of 18 Title I of the Act. Affidavit of William Ehler, App. 24 -25.The hearings before the House Committee on Banking 19 and Currency indicated that the cost of making microfilm copies of checks ranged from 1 1/2 mills per check for 20 small banks down to about 1/2 mill or less for large banks. See House Hearings, supra, n. 1, at 341, 354- 356; 21 H.Rep.No.91 -975 , supra, at 11. The House Report f urther indicates that the legislation was not expected to 22 significantly increase the costs of the banks involved since it was found that many banks already followed the 23 practice of maintaining the records contemplated by the legislation. 24 [California Banker s Ass’n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21,29, 94 S.Ct. 1494 (U.S.Cal. 1974) ] 25 Consequently, by participating in a government FDIC insurance franchise, the banks become agents and officers of the 26 government, and the legal “person” created by that agency then became a subject of legislation later used to destroy the 27 privacy of depos itors and turn the banks literally into SPIES for the government without compensation . All of this was 28 done by the government as a method to expand its tax revenues still further to private persons who would otherwise be 29 beyond its reach . In effect, it w as a conspiracy against the private right to privacy in the name of the almighty tax dollar. 30 The ultimate consequence would also cause many private depositors ultimately to become unlawfully connected to the 31 government “trade or business” franchise by those filling out Currency Transaction Reports against depositors who are not 32 actually engaged in a public office in the U.S. government. We don’t have any facts to back up the proposition below, but 33 we ’ll bet dollars to donuts also based on the case above that: 34 1. There have been more than a few banks in the past who were not FDIC insured and who have probably resented having 35 the Bank Secrecy Act requirements enforced upon them without compensation. More than a few of these banks, we’ll 36 bet, have probably liti gat ed to defend their right NOT to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act just as the California 37 Bankers Association did above. 38 2. That some subset of these banks at some time in the past have petitioned all the way up to the Supreme Court to have 39 their right NOT t o comply with the Bank Secrecy Act protected because they were not in receipt of any consideration 40 to do so. 41 3. That the U.S. Supreme Court and/or lower courts have probably colluded to den y all the appeals of these banks who 42 have sought to enjoin government enforcement actions to compel them without consideration or compensation to 43 comply with the Bank Secrecy Act . The reason they did this is that they don’t want to let the word get out that banks 44 who don’t participate in federal franchises don’t have to obey ANY federal law. That would be disastrous for the 45 expansion of the IRS fraud documented in the Great IRS Hoax , Form #11.302 book, and you know the government is 46 never going to let the plunder and flow of laundered money to shrink from this royal SCAM. That scam is documented 47 below: 48 Great IRS Hoax , Form #11.302 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm Based on the analysis in this section, we can plainly and clearly see that: 49 1. The government had to create the straw man, who is a franchisee and an officer of the government, in order to be able 50 to invade the privacy and activities of private persons who are otherwise beyond their legislative reach. 51 2. Those who partake in federal franchises such as FDIC insurance become officers and agents of the government who 52 can lawfully have du ties imposed by law upon them without compensation, such as the requirement to become a spy 53 for the government within the Bank Secrecy Act .

Those who do business with others participating in government franchises , such as “ national b anks ” participating in 3 FDIC insurance franchises , may at times unwittingly surrender their right to privacy. In the California Bankers case 4 above, that meant the bank depositors lost their privacy because they were indirect beneficiaries of the FDIC insurance 5 franchise. Loss of privacy therefore became the consideration that depositors paid for the “privilege” of having their 6 deposits protected by FDIC insurance. That loss of privacy consisted of: 7 3.1. Having usually FALSE Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) filed against them by ignorant bank employees 8 who have not been educated on what a “trade or business” is. 9 3.2. Having their personal checks photocopied and microfilmed and later being subject to legal discovery and for use 10 in criminal prosecutions of depositors . 11 4. If you want privacy, then you: 12 4.1. Can’t participa te in government franchises 13 4.2. Can’t do business with those who participate in government franchises. 14 4.3. Must surrender all rights to receive any benefit from such things as government insurance. 15 4.4. Must educate bank clerks that you are not engaged in the “trade or business” franchise and therefore may not 16 lawfully become the subject of Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) .

The first official action of 7 this nation declared the foundation of government in these words: 'We hold these truths to be self -evident, [165 8 U.S. 150, 160] that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 9 rights, that among these ar e life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' While such declaration of principles 10 may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and 11 duty, and while in all cases referenced must be had to the o rganic law of the nation for such limits, yet the 12 latter is but the body and the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit, and it is always safe to 13 read the letter of the constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence.

The only way the g overnment can lawfully acquire a right over 6 your private property without just compensation mandated by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution is therefore for you 7 to consent to their use of it by: 8 1. Donating it to a public use. This includes applying for a license or participating in a franchise in which you donate 9 property connected to the franchise to a public use, such as by connecting it with the franchise license number, the 10 Taxpayer Identification Number or Social Security Number. . . OR 11 2. Using the property to hurt the equal rights of others. 12 The above are confirmed by the following: 13 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' 14 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 15 man has honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 16 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does not mean that he must use it for his neighbor's benefit; second, 17 that if he devotes it to a public use [by associating it with a franchise or 18 “public right” using a de facto license number] , he gives to the public a 19 right to control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it 20 upon payment of due compensation. 21 [Budd v. People of State of New York, 143 U.S. 517 (1892) ] 22 Therefore, if you didn’t use your property to hurt someone, the only way the government can lawfully reach and tax your 23 private “property” is to fool you into consenting to donat e it to a public use , a public purpose, or a public office by: 24 1. Compelling you to participate in government franchises that make you into a public officer. Example: Driver’s license 25 and laws that punish people for driving without a license. 26 2. Tricking you into representing a public office in the government by indict ing or enforcing against the public officer and 27 pretending that you are such officer until you rebut them. 28 3. Forcing you to connect the property to franchises using compelled government identification numbers. 29 The above donation process usually happens through omission rather than commission, usually through implied rather than 30 express consent as part of a franchise agreement structured as an adhesion contract: 31 CONTRACT. [. . .] An implied contract is one not created or evidenced by the explicit agreement o f the 32 parties, but inferred by the law, as a matter of reason and justice from their acts or conduct, the circumstances 33 surrounding the transaction making it a reasonable, or even a necessary, assumption that a contract existed 34 between them by tacit unders tanding.

And hence it is said that, while the liability of a party to an 46 express contract arises directly from the contract, it is just the reverse in the case of a contract \"implied in law,\" 47 the contract there being Implied or arisin g from the liability.

However, not 9 every such contract is unconscionable. Lechmere Tire and Sales Co. v. Burwick, 360 Mass. 718, 720, 721, 277 10 N.E.2d 503.” 11 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 40 ] 12 Adhesion contracts have only come into vogue in the last century because of the corporatization of America and the 13 monopolistic power that these large corporations have over the economy. If we didn’t have such large, government 14 sanctioned, corporate monopolies within specific segments of our economy, the sovereign People would have enough 15 choice that they would never knowingly consent to an “adhesion contract” because they could entertain other competitive 16 options. This concept of monopolistic coercion of the public also applies to the federal government. 28 U.S.C. 17 §3002(15)(A) identifies the “United States” government as a “corporation”. It also happens to be the largest corporation in 18 the world which has a virtual monopoly in certain market segments. It has abused this monopolistic power to coerce people 19 into complying with what amounts to an “invisible adhesion contract” called the Infernal Revenue Code. What makes this 20 particular contract “invisible” is the fact that our public servants positively refuse to help you or notify you of precisely 21 what activity or action makes you a party to this private contract. They do this because they don’t want any one escaping 22 their control so that everyone will be trapped in their usurping spider web of tyranny, lies, and deceit. Hence, we had to 23 write this memorandum so you would understand all the nuances of this invisible contract and thus make an informed 24 choi ce about whether you wish to be party to it. In response to publishing the terms of this “stealth contract” within our 25 book, the government has repeatedly harassed, threatened, and persecuted us in an effort to keep the truth away from public 26 view. S ecti on 4.3.2 of the Great IRS Hoax , Form #11.302 reveal s some of the many devious ways that dishonest and evil 27 public servants attempt to conceal, avoid, or hide the requirement for consent in their intera ctions with the public. If you 28 haven’t read that section, then we recommend going back and doing so now before you proceed further. 29 On the subject of “invisible adhesion contracts”, you might want to visit the Family Guardian website and read a 30 fascinatin g series of articles by George Mercier on the subject at: 31 Invisible Contracts , George Mercier http://famguardian.org/PublishedAuthors/Indiv/MercierGeorge/GeorgeMercier.htm It is a maxim of law that you can only lose your rights or property through your voluntary consent: 32 Quod meum est sine me auferri non potest. 33 What is mine cannot be taken away without my consent.

Possession, in turn, can only be created by the consent 18 of of the original owner that conveyed the property to them. The only way the government can “possess” a thing is to bring 19 it within the control of a public officer. 20 “All the powers of the government must be carried into operation by individual agency, either through the 21 medium of public officers, or contracts made with individuals. ” 22 [Osborn v.

When a statute does not specifically define 19 words, such words should be construed in their common or ordinary sense to the effect that the rules used in construing 20 statutes are also applicable in the construction of the Constitution. It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that 21 words of common usage when used in a statute should be construed in their plain and ordinary sense. 22 If you carefully read the statute laws enacted by your STATE legislature you will also notice that they ar e all written with 23 phrases similar to these five examples : 24 1. A person commits the offense of failure to carry a license if the person ... 25 2. A person commits the offense of failure to register a vehicle if the person ... 26 3. A person commits the offense of driving uninsured if the person ... 27 4. A person commits the offense of fishing if the person ... 28 5. A person commits the offense of breathing if the person ... 29 Notice that only \"persons\" can commit these STATE legislature created crimes. A crime is by definition an off ense 30 committed against the \"STATE.\" If you commit an offense against a human, it is called a tort. Examples of torts would be 31 any personal injury, slander, or defamation of character. 32 So how does someone become a \"person\" and subject to regulation by STATE statutes and laws? 33 There is only one way. Contract! You must ask the STATE for permission to volunteer to become a STATE person. You 34 must volunteer because the U.S. Constitution forbids the STATE from compelling you into slavery.

First comes the legislatively c reated office, then comes their control. If you do not have an office in STATE 3 government, the legislature's control over you would also be prohibited by the Declaration of Rights section, usually found 4 to be either Section I or II, of the STATE Constituti on. 5 The most common office held in a STATE is therefore the office known as \"person.\" Your STATE legislature created this 6 office as a way to control people. It is an office most people occupy without even knowing that they are doing so. 7 The legislature can not lawfully control you because you are a flesh and blood human being. God alone created you and by 8 Right of Creation, He alone can control you. It is the nature of Law, that what One creates, One controls. This natural Law 9 is the force that binds a creat ure to its creator. God created us and we are, therefore, subject to His Laws, whether or not we 10 acknowledge Him as our Creator. 11 The way the STATE gets around God's Law and thereby controls the People is by creating only an office, and not a real 12 human. This office is titled as \"person\" and then the legislature claims that you are filling that office. Legislators 13 erroneously now think that they can make laws that also control men. They create entire bodies of laws - motor vehicle 14 code, building code, compul sory education laws, and so on ad nauseum. They still cannot control men or women, but they 15 can now control the office they created. And look who is sitting in that office -- YOU. 16 Then they create government departments to administer regulations to these o ffices. Within these administrative 17 departments of STATE government are hundreds of other STATE created offices. There is everything from the office of 18 janitor to the office of governor. But these administrative departments cannot function properly unless they have subjects to 19 regulate. 20 The legislature obtains these subjects by creating an office that nobody even realizes to be an official STATE office. 21 They have created the office of \"person.\" 22 The STATE creates many other offices such as police officer, pr osecutor, judge etc. and everyone understands this concept. 23 However, what most people fail to recognize and understand is the most common STATE office of all, the office of 24 \"person.\" Anyone filling one of these STATE offices is subject to regulation by the ir creator, the STATE legislature. 25 Through the STATE created office of \"person,\" the STATE gains its authority to regulate, control and judge you, the real 26 human. What they have done is apply the natural law principle, \"what one creates, one controls.\" 27 A l ook in Webster's dictionary reveals the origin of the word \"person.\" It literally means \"the mask an actor wears.\" 28 The legislature creates the office of \"person\" which is a mask. They cannot create real people, only God can do that. But 29 they can create the \"office\" of \"person,\" which is merely a mask, and then they persuade a flesh and blood human being to 30 put on that mask by offering a fictitious privilege, such as a driver license. Now the legislature has gained complete control 31 over both the mask and the actor behind the mask. 32 1. A resident is another STATE office holder. 33 2. All STATE residents hold an office in the STATE government. 34 3. But not everyone who is a resident also holds the office of \"person.\" 35 4.

Some residents are administ rators and bureaucrats and they also are not persons. 40 9. Some residents are attorneys and they also are not persons. 41 10. An attorney is a STATE officer of the court and is firmly part of the judicial branch. The attorneys will all tell you that 42 they are \"licensed \" to practice law by the STATE Supreme Court. Therefore, it is unlawful for any attorney to hold any 43 position or office outside of the judicial branch.

No person belonging to one branch shall exercise any powers appertaining to either of the 6 other branches unless expressly provided herein. 7 Therefore, a police officer cannot arrest a prosecutor, a prosecutor cannot prosecute a sitting judge, a judge cannot order t he 8 legislature to perfo rm and so on. 9 Because these \"offices\" are not “persons”, the STATE will not, and cannot prosecute them, therefore they enjoy almost 10 complete protection by the STATE in the performance of their daily duties. This is why it is impossible to sue or file 11 charg es against most government employees. If their crimes should rise to the level where they \"shock the community\" and 12 cause alarm in the people, then they will be terminated from STATE employment and lose their absolute protection. If you 13 carefully pay atten tion to the news, you will notice that these government employees are always terminated from their 14 office or STATE employment and then are they arrested, now as a common person, and charged for their crimes. Simply 15 put, the STATE will not eat its own. 16 The reason all STATE residents hold an office is so the STATE can control everything. It wants to create every single 17 office so that all areas of your life are under the complete control of the STATE. Each office has prescribed duties and 18 responsibilities and all these offices are regulated and governed by the STATE. If you read the fine print when you apply 19 for a STATE license or privilege you will see that you must sign a declaration that you are in fact a \"resident\" of that 20 STATE. 21 \"Person\" is a subset of res ident. Judge is a subset of resident. Legislator and police officer are subsets of resident. If you 22 hold any office in the STATE, you are a resident and subject to all legislative decrees in the form of statutes. 23 They will always say that we are free men. But they will never tell you that the legislatively created offices that you are 24 occupying are not free. 25 They will say, \"All men are free,\" because that is a true statement. What they do not say is, that holding any STATE office 26 binds free men into slaver y for the STATE. They are ever ready to trick you into accepting the STATE office of \"person,\" 27 and once you are filling that office, you cease to be free men. You become regulated creatures, called persons, totally 28 created by the legislature. You will hear \"free men\" mentioned all the time, but you will never hear about \"free persons.\" 29 If you build your life in an office created by the legislature, it will be built on shifting sands. The office can be changed and 30 manipulated at any time to conform to the whims of the legislature. When you hold the office of \"person\" created by the 31 legislature, your office isn't fixed. Your duties and responsibilities are ever changing. Each legislative session binds a 32 \"person\" to ever more burdens and requirements in the for m of more rules, laws and statutes. 33 Most STATE constitutions have a section that declares the fundamental power of the People: 34 Political power -- All political power is inherent in the People. The enunciation herein of certain Rights shall 35 not be construed to deny or impair others retained by the People. 36 Notice that this says \"people\" it does not say “persons”. This statement declares beyond any doubt that the People are 37 Sovereign over their created government. This is natural law of creation and the natural flow of delegated power. 38 A Sovereign is a private, non- resident, non -domestic, non- person, non- individual, NOT SUBJECT to any real or imaginary 39 statutory regulations or quasi laws enacted by any STATE legislature which was created by the People. 40 When you are pulled over by the police, roll down your window and say, 41"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 71 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ \"You are speaking to a Sovereign political power holder.

Mine W orkers, 330 U.S. 258, 275 (1947) . 19 The idea that the word \"person\" ordinarily excludes the Sovereign can also be traced to t he 20 \"familiar principle that the King is not bound by any act of Parliament unless he be named therein by special 21 and particular words.\" 22 [Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239 (1874) ] 23 As this passage suggests, however, this interpretive principle applies only to \"the enacting Sovereign.\" United States v. 24 California, 297 U.S. 175, 186 (1936) . See also Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 25 U.S. 150, 161, n. 21 (1983) . 26 Furthermore, as explained in United States v. Herron, 20 Wall. 251, 255 (1874) , even the principle as applied to the 27 enacting Sovereign is not without limitations: 28 \"Where an act of Parliament is made for the public good, as for the advancement of religion and justice or to 29 prevent injury and wrong, the king is bound by such act, though not particularly named therein; but where a 30 statute is general, and thereby any prerogative, Right, title, or interest is divested or taken from the king, in 31 such case the king is not bound, unless the statute is made to extend to him by express words.\" 32 U. S. Supreme Court Justice Holmes explained: 33 \"A Sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal co nception or obsolete theory, but on the logical 34 and practical ground that there can be no legal Right as against the authority that makes the law on which the 35 Right depends.\" 36 [Kawananakoa v.

Georgia , 2 Dall. (2 U.S.) 419, 1 L.Ed 440, 455 (1793) ] 3 ... A STATE, useful and valuable as the contrivance is, is the inferior contrivance of man; and from his native dignity 4 derives all its acquired importance. ... 5 Let a STATE be considered as subordinate to the people: But let everything else be subordinate to the STATE. The latter 6 part of this position is equally necessary with the former. For in the practice, and even at length, in the science of politi cs 7 there has very frequently been a strong current against the natural order of things, and an inconsider ate or an interested 8 disposition to sacrifice the end to the means. As the STATE has claimed precedence of the people; so, in the same inverted 9 course of things, the government has often claimed precedence of the STATE; and to this perversion in the second degree, 10 many of the volumes of confusion concerning Sovereignty owe their existence. The ministers, dignified very properly by 11 the appellation of the magistrates, have wished, and have succeeded in their wish, to be considered as the Sovereigns of the 12 STA TE. This second degree of perversion is confined to the old world, and begins to diminish even there: but the first 13 degree is still too prevalent even in the several STATES, of which our union is composed. By a STATE I mean, a complete 14 body of free person s united together for their common benefit, to enjoy peaceably what is their own, and to do justice to 15 others. It is an artificial person. It has its affairs and its interests: It has its rules: It has its Rights: and it has its obligations. It 16 may acquire property distinct from that of its members. It may incur debts to be discharged out of the public stock, not out 17 of the private fortunes of individuals. It may be bound by contracts; and for damages arising from the breach of those 18 contracts. In all our c ontemplations, however, concerning this feigned and artificial person, we should never forget, that, in 19 truth and nature, those who think and speak and act, are men. Is the foregoing description of a STATE a true description? It 20 will not be questioned, but it is. .... See Our Enemy The State 21 It will be sufficient to observe briefly, that the Sovereignties in Europe, and particularly in England, exist on feudal 22 principles. That system considers the prince as the Sovereign, and the people as his subjects; it regards his person as the 23 object of allegiance, and excludes the idea of his being on an equal footing with a subject, either in a court of justice or 24 elsewhere. That system contemplates him as being the fountain of honor and authority; and from his grace and grant derives 25 all franchise, immunities and privileges; it is easy to perceive that such a Sovereign could not be amenable to a court of 26 justice, or subjected to judicial control and actual constraint. It was of necessity, therefore, that suability, be came 27 incompatible with such Sovereignty. Besides, the prince having all the executive powers, the judgment of the courts would, 28 in fact, be only monitory, not mandatory to him, and a capacity to be advised, is a distinct thing from a capacity to be sue d. 29 The same feudal ideas run through all their jurisprudence, and constantly remind us of the distinction between the prince 30 and the subject. 31 \"No such ideas obtain here (speaking of America): at the revolution, the Sovereignty devolved on the people; 32 and they are truly the Sovereigns of the country, but they are Sovereigns without subjects (unless the African 33 slaves among us may be so called) and have none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as 34 fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the Sovereignty.\" 35 [Chisholm v. Georgia (February Term, 1793) 2 U.S. 419, 2 Dall. 419, 1 L. Ed 440 ] 36 There are many ways you can give up your Sovereign power and accept the role of \"person.\" One is by receiving STATE 37 benefits. Another is by asking permission in the form of a license or permit from the STATE. 38 One of the subtlest ways of accepting the role of \"person,\" is to answer the questions of bureaucrats. When a STATE 39 bureaucrat knocks on your door and wants to know why your children aren't registered in school, or a police officer pulls 40 you over and starts asking questions, you i mmediately fill the office of \"person\" if you start answering their questions. 41 It is for this reason that you should ignore or refuse to \"answer\" their questions and instead act like a true Sovereign, a K ing 42 or Queen, and ask only your own questions of the m. 43 You are not a \"person\" subject to their laws. 44 If they persist and haul you into their court unlawfully, your response to the judge is simple and direct, you the Sovereign, 45 must tell him: 46 “I have no need to answer you in this matter. 47"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 73 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ It is none of your business whether I understand my Rights or whether I understand your fictitious charges. 1 It is none of your business whether I want counsel. 2 The reason it is none of your business is because I am not a person regulated by the STATE. I do not hold any 3 position or office where I am subject to the legislature. The STATE legislature does not dictate what I do. 4 I am a free Sovereign \"Man\"(or woman) and I am a political power holder as lawfully decreed in the STATE 5 Constitution at article I (or II) and that constitution is controlling over you.” 6 You must NEVER retain or hire an attorney, a STATE officer of the court, to speak or file written documents for you. Use 7 an attorney (if you must) only for counsel and advice about their \"legal\" system. If you retain an att orney to represent you 8 and speak in your place, you become \"NON COMPOS MENTIS\", not mentally competent, and you are then considered a 9 ward of the court. You LOSE all your Rights, and you will not be permitted to do anything herein. 10 The judge knows that as long as he remains in his office, he is backed by the awesome power of the STATE, its lawyers, 11 police and prisons. The judge w ill try to force you to abandon your Sovereign sanctuary by threatening you with jail. No 12 matter what happens, if you remain fait hful to your Sovereignty, The judge and the STATE may not lawfully move against 13 you. 14 The STATE did not create the office of Sovereign political power holder. Therefore, they do not regulate and control those 15 in the office of Sovereign. They cannot ascribe penalties for breach of that particular office. The reason they have no 16 authority over the office of the Sovereign is because they did not create it and the Sovereign people did not delegate to the m 17 any such power. 18 When challenged, simply remind them that they do not regulate any office of the Sovereign and that their statutes only 19 apply to those STATE employees in legislative created offices. 20 This Sovereign individual paradigm is explained by the following U.S. Supreme Court case: 21 \"The individual may stand upon his constitutional Rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private 22 business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no such duty [to submit his books and 23 papers for an examination] to the STATE, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life 24 and property. His Rights are such as existed by the law of the land [Common Law] long antecedent to the 25 organization of the STATE, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the 26 Constitution. Among his Rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his 27 property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he 28 does not trespass upon their Rights. \" 29 [Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 at 47 (1906) ] 30 Let us analyze this case. It says, \"The individual may stand upon his constitutional Rights.\" It does not s ay, \"Sit on his 31 Rights.\" There is a principle here: \"If you don't use 'em you lose 'em.\" You have to assert your Rights, demand them, \"stand 32 upon\" them. 33 Next it says, \"He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way.\" It says \"private busine ss\" - you have a Right to 34 operate a private business. Then it says \"in his own way.\" It doesn't say \"in the government's way.\" 35 Then it says, \"His power to contract is unlimited.\" As a Sovereign individual, your power to contract is unlimited. In 36 common law there are certain criteria that determine the validity of contracts. They are not important here, except that any 37 contract that would harm others or violate their Rights would be invalid. For example, a \"contract\" to kill someone is not a 38 valid contract. Apart from this obvious qualification, your power to contract is unlimited. 39 Next it says, \"He owes no such duty [to submit his books and papers for an examination] to the STATE, since he receives 40 nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and pro perty.\" The court case contrasted the duty of the corporation (an 41 entity created by government permission - feudal paradigm) to the duty of the Sovereign individual. The Sovereign 42 individual doesn't need and didn't receive permission from the government, hence has no duty to the government. 43"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 74 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ Then it says, \"His Rights are such as existed by the law of the land [Common Law] long antecedent to the organization of 1 the STATE.\" This is very important. The Supreme Court recognized that humans have inherent Rights. The U.S. 2 Constitution (including the Bill of Rights ) does not grant us Rights. We have fundamental Rights, irrespective of what the 3 Constitution says. The Constitution acknowledges some of our Rights. And Amendment IX STATEs, \"The enumeration in 4 the Constitution, of certain Rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" The important 5 point is that our Rights antecede (come before, are senior to) the organization of the STATE. 6 Next the Supreme Co urt says, \"And [his Rights] can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with 7 the Constitution.\" Does it say the government can take away your Rights? No! Your Rights can only be taken away \"by due 8 process of law, and in accordance w ith the Constitution.\" \"Due process of law\" involves procedures and safeguards such as 9 trial by jury. \"Trial By Jury\" means, inter alia, the jury judges both law and fact. 10 Then the case says, \"Among his Rights are a refusal to incriminate himself, and the immunity of himself and his property 11 from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law.\" These are some of the Rights of a Sovereign individual. 12 Sovereign individuals need not report anything about themselves or their businesses to anyone. 13 Finally, the Supreme Court says, \"He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their Rights.\" The 14 Sovereign individual does not have to pay taxes. 15 If you should discuss Hale v. Henkel with a run -of-the -mill attorney, he or she will tell you th at the case is \"old\" and that it 16 has been \"overturned.\" If you ask that attorney for a citation of the case or cases that overturned Hale v. Henkel, there wil l 17 not be a meaningful response. We have researched Hale v. Henkel and here is what we found : 18 1. We k now that Hale v. Henkel was decided in 1905 in the U.S. Supreme Court. 19 2. Since it was the Supreme Court, the case is binding on all courts of the land, until another Supreme Court case says it 20 isn't. Has another Supreme Court case overturned Hale v. Henkel? The answer is NO. As a matter of fact, since 1905, 21 the Supreme Court has cited Hale v. Henkel a total of 144 times. A fact more astounding is that since 1905, Hale v. 22 Henkel has been cited by all of the federal and STATE appellate court systems a total of over 1600 times. None of the 23 various issues of this case has ever been overruled. 24 So if the STATE through the office of the judge continues to threaten or does imprison you, they are trying to force you 25 into the STATE created office of \"person.\" As long as you continue to claim your Rightful office of Sovereign, the STATE 26 lacks all jurisdiction over you. The STATE needs someone filling the office of \"person\" in order to continue prosecuting a 27 case in their courts. 28 A few weeks in jail puts intense pressure u pon most \"persons.\" Jail means the loss of job opportunities, separation from 29 loved ones, and the piling up of debts. Judges will apply this pressure when they attempt to arraign you. When brought in 30 chains before a crowded courtroom the issue of counsel w ill quickly come up and you can tell the court you are In Propria 31 Persona or simply \"PRO PER\", as yourself and you need no other. Those who are \"pro per\" or \"pro se\" are \"representing 32 themself\", which means they are representing an officer in the governme nt. Don't ever claim to be \"pro se\" or \"pro per\", 33 but rather \"sui juris\": 34 “Pro se. For one’s own behalf ; in person. Appearing for oneself, as in the case of one who does not retain a 35 lawyer and appears for himself in court.” 36 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth, p. 1221 ] 37 “Sui juris. Of his own right; possessing full social and civil rights; not under any legal disability , or the 38 power of another, or guardianship. Having capacity to manage one’s own affairs; not under legal disability to 39 act for one’s self.” 40 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth, p. 1434 ] 41 Do not sign the ir papers or cooperate with them because most things about your life are private and are not the STATE's 42 business to evaluate. Here is the Sovereign People's command in the constitution that the STATE respect their privacy: 43 Right of privacy -- Every man or woman has the Right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into their 44 private life except as otherwise provided herein.

They will fraudulently call you the “ beneficiary ” even though technically you AREN’T the beneficiary, but the 34 “trustee”. They want to fool you into believing that you are “benefitted” by being their cheap whore so you won’t rattle 35 your legal chains and try to resign as trustee or complain about the burdens of your uncompensated position. The BIG 36 secret they can’t clue you into i s that you didn’t get any “consideration” in exchange for your duties so the contract is 37 not legally enforceable.

You become surety for the public office and thereby enter into a partnership with the office your consent created. That 4 partnership, in fact, is the one referenced in the definition of “person” found in 26 U.S.C. §6671(b). You are in 5 partnership with Uncle Sam, in fact, because the office is owned by Uncle: 6 TITLE 26 > Subtitle F > CHAPTER 68 > Subchapter B > PART I > § 6671 7 § 6671.

You become a trustee and fiduciary in relation to the ben eficiary, which is the government and not you. 13 4.

It’s a legalized peonage and slavery scheme that no one would consent to if they were give n 27 all the facts about the affects of it BEFORE they signed that government application for a license or a benefit. Your 28 consent instead is procured through constructive fraud and out of your own legal ignorance.

There is no legally enforceable “consideration” so the franchise contract is unenforceable. 41 2. Your consent was procured before you became an adult. Contracts as a minor are unenforceable. 42 3. Your consent was not fully informed. 43 4. The contract was not signed by BOTH parties to it. There is no government signature, so it can’t be binding. 44 5.

It is interesting to note that our most 18 revered founding fathers warned against engaging i n contracts or alliances, and by implication “franchises”, with any 19 government, when they said the following. Now do you understand why the founding fathers made federal legislative 20 jurisdiction “foreign” with respect to the states using the separation of powers? : 21 \"My ardent desire is, and my aim has been...to comply strictly with all our engagements foreign and domestic; 22 but to keep the United States free from political connections with every other Country . To see that they may 23 be independent of all, and under the influence of none.

It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship [IRS, DOJ, and corrupted 4 federal judiciary in collusion] within a [ constitutional ] republic , demanding for itself the rights and privileges 5 [including immunity from prosecution for their wrongdoing in violation of Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 of the 6 Constitution ] accorded to political parties, but denying to all others the liberties [Bill of Rights] guaranteed by 7 the Constitution. Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by 8 the reconciliation of a wide variety of in dividual views, and submit those policies and programs to the 9 electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly 10 [by corrupt judges and the IRS in complete disregard of the tax laws ] prescribed fo r it by the foreign leaders of 11 the world Communist movement [ the IRS and Federal Reserve] . Its members [ the Congress, which was 12 terrorized to do IRS bidding recently by the framing of Congressman Traficant ] have no part in determining its 13 goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members 14 of the Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination [in the public schools by homosexuals, liberals, and 15 socialists] with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined [by the IRS 16 and a corrupted judiciary] to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them by their hierarchical 17 chieftains. Unlike political parties, the Communist Party [thanks to a corrupted federal judiciary ] 18 acknowledges no constitutiona l or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. The 19 Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends 20 by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation aris es not from its numbers, but from its failure to 21 acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the 22 present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available 23 means, including resort to force and violence [or using income taxes]. Holding that doctrine, i ts role as the 24 agency of a hostile foreign power [the Federal Reserve and the American Bar Association (ABA)] renders its 25 existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States.

To ensure that 2 every citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal Government, each employee shall 3 respect and adhere to the principles of ethical conduct set forth in this section, as well as the implementing 4 standards contained in this part and in supplemental agency regulations. 5 2. The “officer” occupying the public office: 6 2.1. Is a human being and a separate legal person from the office he occupies. 7 2.2. Is not the franchisee called “taxpayer”. 8 2.3. Is voluntary surety for the “taxpayer” or office. 9 2.4. Is protected by official immunity so lo ng as he /she /it stays without the bounds of his expressly delegated 10 authority as described by law. 11 2.5. Waives official immunity and becomes personally liable for a tort if he /she/it exceeds the bounds of his lawfully 12 delegated authority. 13 Now lets apply the abo ve concepts to the income tax, which is a franchise tax upon public offices served within the federal 14 government and exercised abroad but not domestically. The activity subject to indirect/excise/privilege tax is a “trade or 15 business”, which is defined as “the functions of a public office” within 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26) . IRS forms that address the 16 citizenship and residence of the submitter relate to the “public officer” and not the office he or she occupies. The office can 17 have a different domicile or residence than the officer . 18 EXAMPLE : For instance, a Congressman who lives outside of the District of Columbia and commutes daily to work inside 19 the Beltway is a nonresident of the “United States” engaged in a public office. “United States” is defined at 26 U.S.C. 20 §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) to include the District of Columbia and exclude states of the Union. Therefore, the states of 21 Maryla nd and Virginia that surround the District of Columbia would not be part of the “United States” described in the 22 I.R.C. As such, the Congressman is a “nonresident alien” (26 U.S.C. §7701(b)(1)(B)) but not an “individual” or 23 “nonresident alien individual” (26 CFR §1.1441- 1(c )(3) ) who has earnings from a “trade or business”, which is a public 24 office. 4 U.S.C. §72 says that office can only lawfully be exercised by the public officer, which is himself, within the 25 District of Columbia and NOT elsewhere. Therefore, any earnings from the office originating from within the District of 26 Columbia become taxable only at the point when the Congressmen goes temporarily abroad under 26 U.S.C. §911 and 27 avails himself of the benefits of a tax treaty. In relation to the foreign country and the tax treaty, he is an alien and therefore 28 an “individual” and therefore pays income tax on earnings during the time he was abroad pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §871. He 29 doesn’t owe any tax on earnings while not abroad under 26 U.S.C. §871, because he can’t be either an “ind ividual” or an 30 “alien” under Title 26 while he is physically located anywhere in America. 31 The only thing the feds can tax is foreign commerce, including imports and exports and earnings in foreign countries. They 32 can’t tax domestic transactions within a state: 33 “ The States, after they formed the Union, continued to have the same range of taxing power which they had 34 before, barring only duties affecting exports, imports, and on tonnage . 2 Congress, on the other hand, to lay 35 taxes in order 'to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States', 36 Art. 1, Sec. 8 , U.S.C.A.Const., can reach every pers on and every dollar in the land with due regard to 37 Constitutional limitations as to the method of laying taxes.” 38 [Graves v.

The reason is quite clear: the “trade or business” scam is the Achilles heal of 17 the IRS fraud and both the IRS and the Courts are loath to even talk about it because there is nothing they can defend 18 themselves with other than unsubstantiate d presumption created by the abuse of the word “includes” and certain key “words 19 of art”. Therefore, whose who want to know how they could lawfully be classified as a “public office” will have to answer 20 that question completely on their own, which is what we will attempt to do in this section. 21 We begin our search with a definition of “public office” from Black’s Dictionary: 22 Public office. The right, authority, and duty created and conferred by law, by which for a given period, either 23 fixed by law or enduring at the pleasure of the creating power, an individual is invested with some portion of 24 the sovereign functions of government for the benefit of the public. Walker v. Rich, 79 Cal.App. 139, 249 P. 56, 25 58.

State v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St. 33. 29 N.E. 593. 34 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, p. 1235 ] 35 Black’s Law Dictionary Sixth Edition f urther clarifies the meaning of a “public office” below: 36 “Essential characteristics of a ‘ public office ’ are: 37 (1) Authority conferred by law, 38 (2) Fixed tenure of office, and 39 (3) Power to exercise some of the sovereign functions of government . 40 41 Key element of such test is that “officer is carrying out a sovereign function. Spring v. Constantino, 168 Conn. 42 563, 362 A.2d 871, 875. Essential elements to establish public position as ‘public office’ are: 43 Position must be created by Constitution, legislature, or through authority conferred by legislature. 44 Portion of sovereign power of government must be delegated to position, 45 Duties and powers must be defined, directly or implied, by legislature or through legislative authority. 46 Duties must be performed independently without control of superior power other than law, and 47 Position must have some permanency.” 48 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1230 ] 49 American Jurisprudence Legal Encyclopedia further clarifies what a “public office” is as follows: 50 “As exp ressed otherwise, the powers delegated to a public officer are held in trust for the people and are to be 51 exercised in behalf of the government or of all citizens who may need the intervention of the officer. 53 52 Furthermore, the view has been expressed tha t all public officers, within whatever branch and whatever level 53 of government, and whatever be their private vocations, are trustees of the people, and accordingly labor 54   53 State ex rel.

There is not a statute or constitutional authority that specifically creates the office. All “public offices” can only be 10 created through legislative authority. 11 2. Their duties are not specifically and exactly enu merated in some Act of Congress. 12 3. They have a boss or immediate supervisor. All duties must be performed INDEPENDENTLY. 13 4. They have anyone but the law and the courts to immediately supervise their activities. 14 5. They are serving as a “public officer” in a locat ion NOT specifically authorized by the law. The law must create the 15 office and specify exactly where it is to be exercised. 4 U.S.C. §72 says ALL public offices of the federal and national 16 government MUST be exercised ONLY in the District of Columbia and not elsewhere, except as expressly provided by 17 law. 18 6. Their position does not carry with it some kind of fiduciary duty to the “public” which in turn is documented in and 19 enforced by enacted law itself. 20 7. The beneficiary of their fiduc iary duty is other than the “public”. Public service is a public trust, and the beneficiary of 21 the trust is the public at large and not any one specific individual or group of individuals. See 5 CFR §2635.101(b) and 22 Executive Order 12731 . 23 All public officers must take an oath. The oath, in fact, is what creates the fiduciary duty that attaches to the office. T his is 24 confirmed by the definition of \"public official\" in Black’s Law Dictionary: 25 A person who, upon being issued a commission, taking required oath , enters upon, for a fixed tenure, a position called an 26 office where he or she exercises in his or her own right some of the attr ibutes of sovereign he or she serves for benefit of 27 public. Macy v. Heverin, 44 Md.App. 358, 408 A.2d 1067, 1069. The holder of a public office though not all persons in 28 public employment are public officials, because public official's position requires the exercise of some portion of the 29 sovereign power, whether great or small.

Franchises and the trusts they implement were the only method available to bypass the straight jacke t chains of the 27 constitution, as Jefferson calls it. 28 10.1 All Government enforcement authority almost exclusively over only the “straw man” 29 “Our records indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has not incorporated by reference [as required by 30 Implementing Regulation 26 CFR § 601.702(a)(1) ] a requirement to make an income tax return. ” [Emphasis 31 added] 32 [SEDM Exhibit #0 5.005 ; 33 SOURCE: http://sedm.org/Exhibits/ExhibitIndex.htm ] 34 This section demonstrate that the only lawful target of nearly all government enforcement activity are its own officers, 35 agents, and employees in the context of their official duties. 36 The Federal Register Act, 44 U.S.C. §1505 et seq., and the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §553 et seq, both 37 describe laws which may be enforced as “laws having general applicability and legal effect”.

The Federal Register is the ONLY approved method by which the public at large domiciled in 4 “States of the Union” are provided with “reasonable notice” and an opportunity to comment publicly on new or proposed 5 statutes OR rules/regulations which will directly affect them and which may be enforced directly against them. 6 TITLE 44 > CHAPTER 15 > § 1508 7 § 1508.

For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of 22 persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein 23 with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. 24 __________________________________________________________________________________________ 25 26 CFR §601.702 Publication and public inspection 26 (a)(2)(ii) Effect of failure to publish. 27 Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms of any matter referred to in 28 subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which is required to be published in the Federal Register , such person is 29 not required in any ma nner to resort to, or be adversely affected by, such matter if it is not so published or is 30 not incorporated by reference therein pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, 31 any such matter which imposes an obligation and which is not so published or incorporated by reference will 32 not adversely change or affect a person's rights. 33 The only exceptions to the requirement for publication in the Federal Register of the statute and the implementing 34 regulations are the groups specifically identified by Congress as expressly exempted from this requirement, as follows: 35 1. A military or foreign affairs function of the United States. 5 U.S.C. §553 (a)(1) . 36 2. A matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. 5 37 U.S.C. §553 (a)(2) . 38 3. Federal agencies or persons in their capacity as officers, agents, or employees thereof. 44 U.S.C. §1505 (a)(1) . 39 Based on the above, the burden of proof imposed upon the government at any due process meeting in which it is enforcing 40 any provi sion is to produce at least ONE of the following TWO things: 41 1. Evidence signed under penalty of perjury by someone with personal, first -hand knowledge, proving that you are a 42 member of one of the three groups specifically exempted from the requirement for im plementing regulations, as 43 identified above. 44 2. Evidence of publication in the Federal Register of BOTH the statute AND the implementing regulation which they 45 seek to enforce against you. 46 Without satisfying one of the above two req uirements, the government is illegally enforcing federal law and becomes liable 47 for a constitutional tort.

In 13 the I.R.C., these “public offices” are described using a “word of art” called a “trade or business”, wh ose definition is found 14 at 26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(26) . Those persons and property not connected to this public office are referred to as a “foreign 15 estate” that is not subject to the Internal Revenue Code: 16 TITLE 26 > Subtitle F > CHAPTER 79 > § 7701 17 § 7701.

The tax is upon a “trade or business”, which is defined as “the functions of a public office”. 30 2. The IRS Internal Revenue Manual admits that “private employers” have no obligation to deduct or withhold. This is 31 another way of saying that only “public employers” within the government have such an obligation. 32 IRM 5.14.10.2 (09 -30- 2004 ) 33 Payroll Deduction Agreements 34 2.

There is no law expressly authorizing any public office within the exclusive jurisdiction of 40 any state of the Union. 41 4. 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(31) defines the term “foreign estate” as any estate that is not connected with the “trade or 42 business” franchise. 43"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 93 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ 5. The regulations state that there is no such thing as “employment” outside the District of Columbia, which is what the 1 “United States” is defined as in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) : 2 Title 26: Internal Revenue 3 PART 31 —EMPLOYMENT TAXES AND COLLECTION OF INCOME TAX AT SOURCE 4 Subpart B —Federal Insurance Contributions Act (Chapter 21, Internal Revenue Code of 1954) 5 General Provisions 6 § 31.3121(b) -3 Employment; services performed after 1954. 7 (a) In general. 8 Whether services performed after 1954 constitute employment is determined in accordance with the provisions 9 of section 3121(b). 10 (b) Services performed within the United States [District of Columbia]. 11 Services performed after 1954 within the United States (see §31.3121(e) –1) by an employee for his employer, 12 unless specifically excepted by section 3121(b), constitute employment. With respect to services performed 13 within the United States, the place where the contract of service is entered into is immaterial. The citizenship or 14 residence of the employee or of the employer also is immaterial except to the extent provided in any specific 15 exception from employment. Thus, the employee and the employer may be citizens and residents of a foreign 16 country and the contract of service may be entered into in a foreign country, and yet, if the employee under such 17 contract performs services within the United States, there may be to that extent employment. 18 \"(c) Services performed outside the United States —(1) In general.

Since the 25 Fourteenth Amendment makes one a citizen of the state wherein he resides, the fact of residence creates 26 universally reciprocal duties of protection by the state and of allegiance and support by the citizen. The latter 27 obviously includes a duty to pay taxes, and their nature and measure is la rgely a political matter. Of course, 28 the situs of property may tax it regardless of the citizenship, domicile, or residence of the owner, the most 29 obvious illustration being a tax on realty laid by the state in which the realty is located.\" 30 [Miller Brothers Co. v.

This was thoroughly described in the following article: 24 There's No Statute Making Anyone Liable to Pay IRC Subtitle A Income Tax es http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Taxes/Articles/NoStatuteLiable.htm The existence of fiduciary duty of “public officers” is therefore the ONLY lawful method by which anyone can be 25 prosecuted for an “omission”, which is a thing they didn’t do that the law required them to do. It is otherwise illegal and 26 unlawful to prosecute anyone under either common law or statutory law for a FAILURE to do something, such as a 27 FAILURE TO FILE a tax return pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §7203 .

Borden, 48 U.S. 1 , 12 LEd 581 (1849 )] 1 An example of someone who is NOT a “public officer” is a federal common law employee on duty and who is not required 2 to take an oath. Almost invariably, such employees have some kind of immediate supervisor who manages and oversees 3 and evaluates his activities pursuant to the position description drafted for the position he fills. He may be a “trustee” a nd 4 he may have a “fiduciary duty” to the pu blic as a “public servant”, but he isn’t an “officer” or “public officer” unless and 5 until he takes an oath of office prescribed by law. A federal “employee”, however, can become a “public office” by virtue 6 of any one or more of the following purposes tha t we are aware of so far: 7 1. Be elected to political office. 8 2. Being appointed to political office by the President or the governor of a state of the Union. 9 3. Voluntarily engaging in a privileged, excise taxable activity called a “trade or business”, which effect ively is an 10 extension of the federal government and is defined as a “public office” in 26 U.S.C. §7701 (a)(26). A “trade or 11 business” is a federal business franchise and partnership, in which you become a trustee and public official of the 12 United States who has donated his private property temporarily to a “public use” for the purpose of procuring 13 “privileged compensation” of a public office in the form of tax deductions under 26 U.S.C. §162 , Earning income 14 credits under 26 U.S.C. §32 , and a graduated REDUCED rate of tax under 26 U.S.C. §1 . Only those engaged in a 15 “public office”/”trade or business” can avail themselves of any of these pecuniary government financial incentives. 16 4. Engaging in a privileged activity regulat ed by the federal government, such as: 17 4.1. Pursuing a license to practice law. All attorneys are officers of the court, and all courts are part of the 18 government and therefore “public” entities. 19 4.2. Applying for and accepting FDIC insurance as an officer of a ban k. See 31 CFR §202.2, which makes those 20 accepting FDIC federal insurance into agents of the federal government. 21 4.3. Becoming an officer of a corporation, and only within the context of the jurisdiction the corp oration is registered 22 in. The officers of a state -only registered corporation would be “public officers” only within the context of the 23 specific state they registered in. They would have to make application for recognition as a federal corporation to 24 als o be “public officers” in the context of federal law. 25 A “public office” is not limited to a natural person. It can also extend to an entire entity such as a corporation. An exam ple 26 of an entity that is a “public office” in its entirety is a federally cha rtered bank, such as the original Bank of the United 27 States described in Osborn v. United States , in which the U.S. Supreme Court identified the original and first Bank of the 28 United States, a federally chartered bank corporation created by Congress, as a “public office”: 29 All the powers of the government must be carried into operation by individual agency, either through the 30 medium of public officers, or contracts made with individuals. Can any public office be created, or does one 31 exist, the performance of which may, with propriety, be assigned to this association [or trust], when 32 incorporated? If such office exist, or can be created, then the company may be incorporated, that they may 33 be appointed to execute such office. Is there any portion of the public business performed by individuals 34 upon contracts, that this association could be employed to perform, with greater advantage and more safety 35 to the public, than an individual contractor? If there be an employment of this nature, then may this 36 company be incorporated to undertake it. 37 There is an employment of this nature. Nothing can be more essential to the fiscal concerns of the nation, than 38 an agent of undoubted integrity and established credit, with whom the public moneys can, at all times, be safely 39 deposited. Nothing can be of more importance to a government, than that there should be some capitalist in the 40 country, who possesses the means of making advances of money to the government upon any exigency, and who 41 is under a legal obligation to make such advances. For these purposes the association would be an agent 42 peculiarly suitable and appropriate. [. . .] 43 The mere creation of a corporation, does not confer political power or political character. So this Court 44 decided in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, already referred to. If I may be allowed to paraphrase the 45 language of the Chief Justice, I would say, a bank incorporated, is no more a State instrument, than a natural 46 person performing the same business would be. If, then, a natural person, engaged in the trade of banking, 47 should contract with the government to receive the public money upon deposit, to transmit it from place to 48 place, without charging for commission or difference of exchange, and to perform, when called upon, the duties 49 of commissioner of loans, would not thereby become a public officer, how is it that this artificial being, created 50 by law for the purpose of being employed by the government for the same purposes, should become a part of the 51 civil government of the country? Is it because its existence, its capacities, its powers, are given by law? because 52 the government has given it power to take and hold property in a particular form, and to employ that property 53 for particular purposes, and in the disposition of it to use a particular nam e? because the government has sold 54 it a privilege [22 U.S. 738, 774] for a large sum of money, and has bargained with it to do certain things; is it, 55 therefore, a part of the very government with which the contract is made? 56"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 98 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ If the Bank be constituted a p ublic office, by the connexion between it and the government, it cannot be the 1 mere legal franchise in which the office is vested; the individual stockholders must be the officers. Their 2 character is not merged in the charter. This is the strong point of the Mayor and Commonalty v. Wood, upon 3 which this Court ground their decision in the Bank v. Deveaux, and from which they say, that cause could not 4 be distinguished. Thus, aliens may become public officers, and public duties are confided to those who owe no 5 allegiance to the government, and who are even beyond its territorial limits. 6 With the privileges and perquisites of office, all individuals holding offices, ought to be subject to the 7 disabilities of office. But if the Bank be a public office, and the individual stockholders public officers, this 8 principle does not have a fair and just operation. The disabilities of office do not attach to the stockholders; for 9 we find them every where holding public offices, even in the national Legislature, from which, if they be public 10 officers, they are excluded by the constitution in express terms. 11 If the Bank be a public institution of such character as to be justly assimilated to the mint and the post office, 12 then its charter may be amended, altered, or even abolished, at the discretion of the National Legislature. All 13 public offices are created [22 U.S. 738, 775] purely for public purposes, and may, at any time, be modified 14 in such manner as the public interest may require. Public corporations partake of the same character. So it is 15 distinctly adjudged in Dartmouth College v. Woodward. In this point, each Judge who delivered an opinion 16 concurred. By one of the Judges it is said, that ' public corporations are generally esteemed such as exist for 17 public political pur poses only, such as towns, cities, parishes and counties; and in many respects they are so, 18 although they involve some private interests; but, strictly speaking, public corporations are such only as are 19 founded by the government for public purposes, where the whole interest belongs also to the government. If, 20 therefore, the foundation be private, though under the charter of the government, the corporation is private, 21 however extensive the uses may be to which it is devoted, either by the bounty of the found er, or the nature 22 and objects of the institution. For instance, a bank, created by the government for its own uses, whose stock 23 is exclusively owned by the government, is, in the strictest sense, a public corporation. So, a hospital created 24 and endowed by the government for general charity. But a bank, whose stock is owned by private persons, is 25 a private corporation, although it is erected by the government, and its objects and operations partake of a 26 public nature. The same doctrine may be affirmed of ins urance, canal, bridge, and turnpike companies. In 27 all these cases, the uses may, in a certain sense, be called public, but the corporations are private; as much 28 [22 U.S. 738, 776] so, indeed, as if the franchises were vested in a single person.[. . .] 29 In what sense is it an instrument of the government? and in what character is it employed as such? Do the 30 government employ the faculty, the legal franchise, or do they employ the individuals upon whom it is 31 conferred? and what is the nature of that employment? does it resemble the post office, or the mint, or the 32 custom house, or the process of the federal Courts? 33 The post office is established by the general government. It is a public institution. The persons who perform its 34 duties are public officers. No individual has, or can acquire, any property in it. For all the services performed, 35 a compensation is paid out of the national treasury; and all the money received upon account of its operations, 36 is public property. Surely there is no similitude between this institution, and an association who trade upon 37 their own capital, for their own profit, and who have paid the government a million and a half of dollars for a 38 legal character and name, in which to conduct their trade. 39 Again: the business conducted through the agency of the post office, is not in its nature a private business. It is 40 of a public character, and the [22 U.S. 738, 786] charge of it is expressly conferred upon Congress by the 41 constitution. The business is created by law, and is annihilated wh en the law is repealed. But the trade of 42 banking is strictly a private concern. It exists and can be carried on without the aid of the national Legislature. 43 Nay, it is only under very special circumstances, that the national Legislature can so far interfer e with it, as to 44 facilitate its operations. 45 The post office executes the various duties assigned to it, by means of subordinate agents. The mails are opened 46 and closed by persons invested with the character of public officers. But they are transported by individuals 47 employed for that purpose, in their individual character, which employment is created by and founded in 48 contract. To such contractors no official character is attached. These contractors supply horses, carriages, and 49 whatever else is necessary for the transportation of the mails, upon their own account. The whole is engaged in 50 the public service. The contractor, his horses, his carriage, his driver, are all in public employ. But this does 51 not change their character. All that was private property before the contract was made, and before they were 52 engaged in public employ, remain private property still. The horses and the carriages are liable to be taxed as 53 other property, for every purpose for which property of the same character is taxed in the pl ace where they are 54 employed. The reason is plain: the contractor is employing his own means to promote his own private profit, 55 and the tax collected is from the individual, though assessed upon the [22 U.S. 738, 787] means he uses to 56 perform the public s ervice. To tax the transportation of the mails, as such, would be taxing the operations of the 57 government, which could not be allowed. But to tax the means by which this transportation is effected, so far as 58 those means are private property, is allowable; because it abstracts nothing from the government; and because, 59 the fact that an individual employs his private means in the service of the government, attaches to them no 60 immunity whatever.” 61 [Osborn v.

Read 3 the amazing truth for yourself: 4 House of Representatives, Ex. Doc. 99, 1867 http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Taxes/Evidence/PublicOrPrivate -Tax -Return.pdf Below is an excerpt from that report proving our point. The Secretary of the Treasury at the time is comparing t he federal 5 tax liabilities of postal clerks to those of internal revenue clerks. At that time, the IRS was called the Bureau of Interna l 6 Revenue. The office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue was established in 1862 as an emergency measure to fund the 7 Civil War, which ended shortly thereafter, but the illegal enforcement of the revenue laws continued and expanded into the 8 states over succeeding years: 9 House of Representatives, Ex. Doc. 99, 1867, pp. 1- 2 10 39 th Congress, 2d Session 11 Salary Tax Upon Clerks to Postmasters 12 Letter form the Secretary of the Treasury in answer to A resolution of the House of the 12 th of February, 13 relative to salary tax upon clerks to postmasters, with the regulations of the department 14 Postmasters' clerks are appointed by postmaster s, and take the oaths of office pre scribed in the 2d sectio n of 15 the act of Jul y 2, 1 862, an d in the 2d s ection of the act of March 3, 1863. 16 Their salaries are not fixed in amount bylaw, b ut from time to time the Post master General fixes the amou nt', 17 allo tted to ea ch postm aster for clerk hire, under the authority conferred upon him by tile ninth section of th e act 18 of June 5, 1836, and then the postmaster, a s an agent for and in be half of the Un ited States, determines the 19 salary to b e paid to each of his clerks. T hese salaries are paid by the postmasters, acting as disbursing agents, 20 .from United States moneys advanced to the m for this pu rpose, eith er directly from the Post Office Department 21 in pursuance of appropri ation s made by la w, or fro m the accruing revenues of their offices , under the 22 instructions of th e Postmaster General. The receipt of such clerks constitute vouchers in the accounts of the 23 postmasters acting as disbursing agents in the settlements made with them by the Sixth Auditor. In the 24 forego ing transactions the postmaster acts not as a principal, but as an agent of the United States, and the 25 clerks are not in his private employment, but in the public employment of the United States. Such being the 26 facts, these clerks are subjected to and req uired to account for and pay the salary tax , imposed by the one 27 hundred and twenty -third section of the internal revenue act of June 30, 1864, as amended by the ninth section 28 of the internal revenue act of July 13, 1866, upon payments for services to perso ns in the civil employment or 29 service of the United States. 30 Copies of the regulations under which such salary taxes are withheld and paid into the treasury to the credit of 31 internal revenue collection account are herewith transmitted, marked A, b, and C. C lerks to assessors of 32 internal revenue [IRS agents] are appointed by the assessors. Neither law nor regulations require them to 33 take an oath of office, because, as the law at present stands, they are not in the public service of the United 34 States, through the agency of the assessor, but are in the private service of the assessor, as a principal, who 35 employs them. 36 The salaries of such clerks are neither fixed in amount by law, nor are they regulated by any officer of the 37 Treasury Department over the clerk h ire of assessors is to prescribe a necessary and reasonable amount which 38 shall not be exceeded in reimbursing the assessors for this item of their expenses. 39 No money is advanced by the United States for the payment of such salaries, nor do the assessors perform the 40 duties of disbursing agents of the United States in paying their clerks. The entire amount allowed is paid 41 directly to the assessor, and he is not accountable to the United States for its payment to his clerks, for the 42 reason that he has paid them in advance, out of his own funds, and this is a reimbursement to him of such 43 amount as the department decides to be reasonable. No salary tax is therefore collected, or required by the 44 Treasury Department to be accounted for, or paid, on account of pay ments to the assessors’ clerks, as the 45 United States pays no such clerks nor has them in its employ or service, and they do not come within the 46 provisions of existing laws imposing such a tax. 47 Perhaps no better illustration of the difference between the status of postmasters’ clerks and that of assessors’ 48 clerks can be given than the following: A postmaster became a defaulter, without paying his clerks,; his 49 successor received from the Postmaster General a new remittance for paying them; and if at any time, the 50 clerks in a post office do not receive their salaries, by reason of the death, resignation or removal of a 51 postmaster, the new appointee is authorized by the regulations of the Post Office Department to pay them out of 52"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 100 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ the proceeds of the office; and should there be no funds in his hands belonging to the department, a draft is 1 issued to place money in his hands for that purpose. 2 If an assessor had not paid his clerks, they would have no legal claim upon the treasury for their salaries.

Doc. 99, 1867, pp. 1- 2] 8 Notice based on the above that revenue officers don’t take an oath, so they don’t have to pay the tax, while postal clerks 9 take an oath, so they do. Therefore, the oath that creates the “public office” is the method by which the government 10 manufactures “public officers”, “taxpayers”, and “sponsors” for its wasteful use or abuse of public monies. If you wo uld 11 like a whole BOOK full of reasons why the only \"taxpayers\" under the I.R.C. Subtitle A are \"public officials\", please see 12 the following exhaustive analysis: 13 Why Your Government is Either a Thief or You are a “Public Officer” for Income Tax Purposes , Form #05.008 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 10.3 The Information Return Scam 14 As we said in the preceding section, the income tax described by Internal Revenue Code, S ubtitle A is a franchise and 15 excise tax upon “public offices” within the U.S. government, which the code defines as a “trade or business”. Before an 16 income tax can lawfully be enforced or collected, the subject of the tax must be connected to the activity with court - 17 admissible evidence. Information returns are the method by which the activity is connected to the subject of the tax under 18 the authority of 26 U.S.C. §6041(a) . When this connection is made, the person engaging in the excise taxable activity is 19 called “effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States”. 20 TITLE 26 > Subtitle F > CHAPTER 61 > Subchapter A > PART III > Subpart B > § 6041 21 § 6041.

The ability to regulate private conduct is, in fact, “repugnant to 34 the constitution” as held by the U.S. Supreme Court. The only thing the government can regulate is “public conduct” and 35 the “public rights” and franchises that enforce or implement it. Consequently, the government must deceive private parties 36 into submitting false reports connecting their private lab or and private property to such a public use, public purpose, and 37 public office in order that they can usurp jurisdiction over it and thereby tax and plunder it. 38 “The power to \"legislate generally upon\" life, liberty, and property, as opposed to the \"power to provide modes 39 of redress\" against offensive state action, was \"repugnant\" to the Constitution.

This is exhaustively proven in the 10 following: 11 The “Trade or Business” Scam , Form #0 5.001 , Section 11 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm What makes so meone a “private American” is, in fact, that they are not lawfully engaged in a public office or any other 12 government franchise. All franchises, in fact, make those engaged into public officers of one kind or another and cause 13 them to forfeit their status as a private person and give up all their constitutional rights in the process. See: 14 Government Instituted Slavery Using Franchises , Form #05.030 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm IRS therefore mis -represents and mis -enforces the Internal Revenue Code by abusing their tax forms and their 15 untrustworthy printed propaganda as a method: 16 1. To unlawfully create public offices in the government in places they are forbidden to even exist pursuant to 4 U.S.C. 17 §72 . 18 2. To “elect” the average American unlawfully into such an office. 19 3. To cause those involuntarily serving in the office to unlawfully impersonate a public officer in criminal violation of 18 20 U.S.C. §912 . 21 4. To enforce the obligations of the office upon those who are not lawfully occupying said office. 22 5. Of election fraud, whereby the contributions collected cause those who contribute them to bribe a public official to 23 procure the office that they occupy with unlawfully collected monies, in crimi nal violation of 18 U.S.C. §210.

An agreement may be entered into under this section only with respect to amounts 8 which are includible in the gross income of the employee under section 61, and must be applicable to all 9 such amounts paid by the employer to the employee. The amount to be withheld pursuant to an agreement 10 under section 3402(p) shall be determined under the rules contained in section 3402 and the regulations 11 thereunder. See §31.3405(c) –1, Q&A –3 concerning agreements to have more than 20- percent Federal income 12 tax withheld from eligible rollover distributions within the meaning of section 402. 13 Those who have not voluntarily signed an d submitted the IRS Form W -4 contract/agreement and who are were not lawfully 14 engaged in a “public office” within the U.S . government BEFORE they signed any tax form can not truthfully or lawfully 15 earn reportable “wages” as legally defined in 26 U.S.C. §3402 . Therefore, even if the IRS sends a “lock -down” letter 16 telling th e private employer to withhold at a rate of “single with no exemptions”, he must withhold ONLY on the amount of 17 “wages” earned, which is still zero. If a W -2 is filed against a person who does not voluntarily sign and submit the W -4 or 18 who is not lawfully engaged in a public office : 19 1. The amount reported must be ZERO for everything on the form, and especially for “wages”. 20 2. If any amount reported is other than zero, then the payroll clerk submitting the W -2 is criminally liable for filing a false 21 return under 26 U.S.C. §7206 , punishable as a felony for up to a $100,000 fine and three years in jail. 22 3. If you also w arned the payroll clerk that they were doing it improperly in writing and have a proof you served them 23 with it, their actions also become fraudulent and they additionally liable under 26 U.S.C. §7207 , punishable as a felony 24 for up to $10,000 and up to one year in jail. 25 The heart of the tax fraud and SCAM perpetrated on a massive scale by our government then is: 26 1. To publish IRS forms and publications which contain untrustworthy information that deceives the public into believing 27 that they have a legal obligation to file false information returns against their neighbor. 28 \"IRS Publications, issued by the National Office, explain the law in plain language for taxpayers and their 29 advisors... While a good source of general information, publications should not be cited to sustain a position .\" 30 [ Internal Revenue Manual, Section 4.10.7.2.8 (05 -14- 1999)] 31 2. To reinforce the deliberate deception and omissions in their publications with verbal advice that is equ ally damaging 32 and untrustworthy: 33 p. 21: \"As discussed in §2.3.3, the IRS is not bound by its statements or positions in unofficial pamphlets and 34 publications .\" 35 p. 34: \" 6. IRS Pamphlets and Booklets . The IRS is not bound by statements or positions in i ts unofficial 36 publications, such as handbooks and pamphlets. \" 37 p. 34: \" 7. Other Written and Oral Advice . Most taxpayers' requests for advice from the IRS are made orally. 38 Unfortunately, the IRS is not bound by answers or positions stated by its employe es orally, whether in person or 39 by telephone. According to the procedural regulations, 'oral advice is advisory only and the Service is not 40 bound to recognize it in the examination of the taxpayer's return.' 26 CFR §601.201(k)(2) . In rare cases, 41 however, the IRS has been held to be equitably estopped to take a position different from that stated orally to, 42 and justifiably relied on by, the taxpayer. The Omnibus Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act, enacted as part of the 43 Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 , gives taxpayers some comfort, however. It amended section 44 6404 to require the Service to abate any penalty or addition to tax that is attributable to advice furnished in 45 writing by any IRS agent or employee acting within the sco pe of his official capacity. Section 6404 as amended 46 protects the taxpayer only if the following conditions are satisfied: the written advice from the IRS was issued in 47 response to a written request from the taxpayer; reliance on the advice was reasonable; and the error in the 48 advice did not result from inaccurate or incomplete information having been furnished by the taxpayer. Thus, it 49 will still be difficult to bind the IRS even to written statements made by its employees. As was true before, 50 taxpayers may be penalized for following oral advice from the IRS .\" 51 [ Tax Procedure and Tax Fraud , Patricia Morgan, 1999, ISBN 0- 314- 06586- 5, West Group] 52"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 104 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ 3. To make it very difficult to describe yourself as either a “nontaxpayer” or a person not subject to the Internal Revenue 1 Code on any IRS form. IRS puts the “exempt” option on their forms, but has no optio n for “not subject”. You can be 2 “not subject” and a “nontaxpayer” without being “exempt” and if you want to properly and lawfully describe yourself 3 that way, you have to either modify their form or create your own substitute. You cannot, in fact be an “e xempt 4 individual” as defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(b)(5) without first being an “individual” and therefore subject to the I.R.C.. 5 The following entity would be “not subject” but also not an “exempt individual” or “exempt”, and could include people 6 as well as property: 7 TITLE 26 > Subtitle F > CHAPTER 79 > § 7701 8 § 7701.

For the IRS to be protected by a judicial “protection racket” implemented by judges who have a conflict of interest as 18 “taxpayers” in violation of 18 U.S.C. §208, 28 U.S.C. §144 , and 28 U.S.C. §455 . This protection racket was instituted 19 permanently upon federal judges with the Revenue Act of 1932 as documented in: 20 4.1. Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920) 21 4.2. O'Malley v.

To protect the filers of these false reports. 26 6.1. IRS Forms W -2, 1042 -S, 1098, and 1099 do not contain the individual identi ty of the person who prepared the 27 form. 28 6.2. Only IRS forms 1096 and W -3 contain the identity and statement under penalty of perjury signed by the specific 29 individual person who filed the false information return. 30 6.3. If you send a FOIA to the Social Security Administration asking for the IRS Forms 1096 and W -3 connected to 31 the specific information returns filed against you, they very conveniently will tell you that they don’t have the 32 documents, even though they are the ONLY ones who receive them in the government! They instead tell you to 33 send a FOIA to the IRS to obtain t hem.

Consequently, there 3 is no way to identify the specific individual who filed the original false reports or to prosecute them criminally 4 under 26 U.S.C. §§7206 and 7207 or civilly under 26 U.S.C. §7434. In that sense, IRS FOIA offices act as 5 “witness protection programs” for those communist informants for the government willfully engaged in criminal 6 activity. 7 Internal Revenue Manual 8 3.5.20.19 (10 -01- 2003) 9 Information Returns Transcripts - 1099 Information 10 1.

By penalizing filers of corrected information returns up to $5,000 for each Form 4852 filed purs uant to 26 U.S.C. 12 §6702. 13 7.2. By not providing forms to correct the false reports for ALL THOSE who could be the subject of them. IRS Form 14 4852, for instance, says at the top “ Attach to Form 1040, 1040A, 1040 -EZ, or 1040X . ” There is no equivalent 15 form for use by nonresident aliens who are victims of false IRS Form W -2 or 1099 -R and who file a 1040NR. 16 7.3. To refuse to accept W -2C forms filed by those other than “employers”. 17 7.4. To refuse to accept custom, substitute, or modified forms that would correct the original reports. 18 7.5. To not help those submitting the cor rections by saying that they were not accepted, why they were not accepted, 19 or how to make them acceptable. 20 8. To ignore correspondence directed at remedying all the above abuses and thereby obstruct justice and condone and 21 encourage further unlawful activity . 22 So what we have folks is a deliberate, systematic plan that: 23 1. Turns innocent parties called “nontaxpayers” into guilty parties called “taxpayers”, which the U.S. Supreme Court said 24 they cannot do. 25 \"In Calder v. Bull, which was here in 1798, Mr. Justice Chase said, that there were acts which the Federal 26 and State legislatures could not do without exceeding their authority, and among them he mentioned a law 27 which punished a citizen for an innocent act; a law that destroyed or impaired the lawful private [lab or] 28 contracts [and labor compensation, e.g. earnings from employment through compelled W -4 withholding] of 29 citizens; a law that made a man judge in his own case; and a law that took the property from A [the worker]. 30 and gave it to B [the government or another citizen, such as through social welfare programs]. 'It is against 31 all reason and justice,' he added, 'for a people to intrust a legislature with such powers, and therefore it 32 cannot be presumed that they have done it. They may command what is right and prohibit what is wrong; but 33 they cannot change innocence into guilt, or punish [being a \"nontaxpayer\"] as a crime [being a 34 \"taxpayer\"] , or violate the right of an antecedent lawful private [employment] contract [by compelling W -4 35 withholding, for instance], or the right of private property.

Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by 32 the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, and submit those policies and programs to the 33 electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly 34 [by corrupt judges and the IRS in complete disregard of the ta x laws ] prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of 35 the world Communist movement [ the IRS and Federal Reserve] . Its members [the Congress, which was 36 terrorized to do IRS bidding recently by the framing of Congressman Traficant ] have no part in determining 37 its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party objectives. Unlike members of political parties, 38 members of the Communist Party are recruited fo r indoctrination [in the public schools by homosexuals, 39 liberals, and socialists] with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and 40 disciplined [by the IRS and a corrupted judiciary] to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them 41 by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political parties, the Communist Party [thanks to a corrupted federal 42 judiciary ] acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its 43 members. The Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of capacity ever to 44 attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but 45 from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the 46 proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be br ought to ruin 47 by any available means, including resort to force and violence [or using income taxes]. Hol ding that doctrine, 48 its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power [the Federal Reserve and the American Bar Association (ABA)] 49 renders its existence a clear present and continu ing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means 50 whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding, 51"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 109 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutiona ry services.

Agency. 12 2.1. Parties made liable under 26 U.S.C. §6041(a) are “taxpayers”. 13 “ Revenue Laws relate to taxpayers [instrumentalities, officers, employees, and elected officials of the Federal 14 Government] and not to non- taxpayers [American Citizens/American Nationals not subject to the exclusive 15 jurisdiction of the Federal Government]. The latter are without their sco pe. No procedures are prescribed for 16 non- taxpayers and no attempt is made to annul any of their Rights or Remedies in due course of law.

U.S., 470 F2d. 585 (1972) ] 20 2.2. All “taxpayers” are public officers in the government and therefore exercising agency of the government. See: 21 Why Your Government is Either a Thief or You are a “Public Officer” for Income Tax Purposes , Form #05.008 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 3. Property being acquired or transferred that would otherwise be illegal: 22 3.1. It constitutes involuntary servitude in violation of th e Thirteenth Amendment for the government to impose any 23 duty on the bank, including the duty to prepare information returns without compensation . Therefore, 24 government is acquiring services of another, which is property, without apparent compensation. 25 3.2. The duty is imposed on “taxpayers”, not men or women. “Taxpayers” are public officers and Congress has 26 always had the right to regulate the conduct of its own officers and agents. 27 3.3. “Taxpayers” receive the following compensation or financial “benefit” for thei r participation in the “trade or 28 business” and “public office” franchise, and therefore they do not work for free and are not slaves : 29 3.3.1. A reduced, graduated rate of tax under 26 U.S.C. §1 . Those not engaged in a “trade or business” a s shown 30 in 26 U.S.C. §871(a) must pay a higher, flat rate of 30% on all earnings. 31 3.3.2. Earned income credits under 26 U.S.C. §32. 32 3.3.3. “trade or business” deductions that reduce their existing liability under 26 U.S.C. §162 . 33 10.4 Definition of “income” means earnings of a trust or estate 34 The term “income” is defined as in the Internal Revenue Code as follows: 35 TITLE 26 > Subtitle A > CHAPTER 1 > Subchapter J > PART I > Subpart A > § 643 36 § 643.

The earnings on the form are NO T your earnings, but all the earnings of the trust, for which you are acting as the 4 trustee. That trust is the Social Security Trust created when you signed up for Social Security. This is also the ONLY 5 entity that can earn “income” as legally defined in 26 U.S.C. §643(b) , which says that “income” as legally defined can 6 only be earned by an estate or a trust, and NOT a natural being. 7 2. The “deductions” authorized on the IRS Form 1040 derive from 26 U.S.C. §162 are the method of computing 8 compensation of the trustees. These deductions, pursuant to that section, may only be taken for those engaged in the 9 “trade or business” fran chise. 10 3. The reason you can’t deduct the cost of producing your labor on the form is that it isn’t YOU who performed the labor, 11 but rather you while you were voluntarily acting as a “public officer” in expectation of the commercial benefits 12 associated with t he “public office”. See: 13 How the Government Defrauds You Out of Legitimate Deductions for the Market Value of Your Labor , Form #05.026 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 4. All of the earnings that go on the IRS Form 1040 MUST be connected with a “trade or business” because: 14 4.1. 26 U.S.C. §162 says that only those engaged in the “trade or business” franchise can take deductions, and 15 everything on the 1040 form is subject to such deductions and therefore connected to the franchise. 16 4.2. IRS Form 1040 uses a graduated rate of tax which is only authorized for earnings connected with a “trade or 17 business”, as shown in 26 U.S.C. §871(b). 18 4.3. 26 U.S.C. §871(b)(1) admits that everything in 26 U.S.C. §1 and therefore appearing on IRS Form 1040 is “trade 19 or business” income. 20 TITLE 26 > Subtitl e A > CHAPTER 1 > Subchapter N > PART II > Subpart A > § 871 21 § 871.

The ONLY “United States” where 29 EVERYTHING is connected to a “public office” is the United States gover nment, and not the geographical 30 United States. 31 TITLE 26 > Subtitle A > CHAPTER 1 > Subchapter N > PART I > § 864 32 § 864.

IRS Document 7130 confirms that IRS Form 1040 is only for use by “U.S. citizens” and “residents”, both of 39 whom have in common a domicile in the SAME “United States” above, meaning that they are officers of the 40 government corporation. 41 1040A 11327A Each 42 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return 43"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 112 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ Annual income tax return filed by citizens and residents of the United States .

The government can lawfully define the meaning of “profit” on the IRS Form 1040 because: 20 5.1. It is not legislating for private entities, but rather “public offices” and federal business trusts. 21 5.2. It is supervising its own instrume ntalities and therefore is not restrained by the common law. 22 5.3. You can’t earn “income” and therefore “gross income” pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §643(b) unless you are 23 5.3.1. A trustee of the federal business trust . .AND 24 5.3.2. The earnings have been connected to the “public office” and business trust using a usually FALSE 25 information return as described earlier in section 10.3 . 26 6. The IRS carefully and deliberately conceals the nature of the IRS Form 1040 as a form ONLY for “public offices” in 27 the government by: 28 6.1. Hiding the phrase “public office” within the definition of “trade or business” at 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26) at the end 29 of the code in a place that few would ever notice. 30 6.2. Using the phrase “trade or business” instead of “public office” so as not to draw attention to the nature of the 31 activity being exercised. 32 6.3. Conveniently omitting mention on the IRS Form 1040 that everything on the form is “trade or business”/ “public 33 office” earnings. 34 6.4. Conveniently omitting to mention in the IRS Form 1040 Instruction Booklet that everyt hing on the form is “trade 35 or business”/ “public office” earnings. 36 6.5. Conveniently omitting to mention in 26 U.S.C. §1 that everything that subject refers to is connected with the 37 “trade or business” franchise. 38 6.6. Conveniently omitting the definition of “United States” from EVERYTHING they publish. It means the 39 GOVERNMENT, and not the geographical definition. The definition found in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) 40 is the geographical definition, but that is not the ONLY sense, or even the most prevalent sense in which it is 41 used throughout I.R.C. Subtitle A , in which it means the government and not the geographical United States. 42 7. The reaso n the IRS and the government carefully conceal the nature of the IRS Form 1040 as a form for “public 43 offices” and therefore federal business trusts within the government is that they want to avoid all the following: 44 7.1. Having to answe r inevitable questions from millions of people about what a “trade or business” is or whether they 45 are involved in it. 46 7.2. Having to admit that most people are not lawfully engaged in a public office in the U.S. government. 47 7.3. Having to admit that they can’t lawf ully regulate or especially tax private conduct. 48 7.4. Becoming an accessory after the fact to the crime of “impersonating an employee or officer of the government” 49 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §912. 50 Welcome to the MATRIX, friends!

Consenting to accept receipt, custody, and control of government property as a formerly private person and thereby 11 become a public officer . 20 CFR §422.103(d) identifies the Social Security Card as property of the Social Security 12 Administration. The card itself says it belongs to the Social Security Administration and must be returned upon 13 request. The SSA Form SS- 5 application says it is an application for a Social Security Card, and NOT an application 14 for “benefits”. You are simply asking to receive government property, and that property comes with strings attached: 15 3.1. You become “federal personnel” under 5 U.S.C. §552a (a)(13). 16 3.2. You become a “fiduciary ” under 26 U.S.C. §6901 . 17 3.3. You become a “transferee” under 26 U.S.C. §6093 . 18 3.4. You agree to act as an “indi vidual”. The trust is actually the “individual” and the public office in the government, 19 and you are acting as its agent and officer. 20 4. Accepting the “consideration” involved in the possibility but not absolute right to receive “benefits” of participation. 21 See: 22 The Government “Benefits” Scam , Form #05.040 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 5. Agreeing to act as the “trustee” over the trust so created. You are NOT in fact becom ing the Beneficiary but rather the 23 Trustee of the trust. Your public servants, in fact, become the REAL beneficiary because they and not you control all 24 the property tha t you associate the trustee license number with. Then they LIE to you by calling you a “beneficiary”. 25 What a joke! All trusts and corporations created by the government are what is called “eleemosynary charitable trusts 26 and corporations” , and all such t rusts exist for the e qual benefit of all. 27 “Eleemosynary corporation. A private corporation created for charitable and benevolent purposes. 28 Charitable corporation. See also Charitable organization.” 29 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 520 ] 30 The only way that anyone can receive specified compensation from such a trust is as an “employee ” of the trust and a 31 public officer in the governmen t called a “Trustee”. If you were a “beneficiary” instead of a “trustee”, then 32 EVERYONE in the public, including those who never signed up or paid in , could receive equal “benefits” and this is 33 not how the program is run. Therefore, the program can only be offered to officers of the government and not the 34 public generally. Otherwise, the government will have created a “Title of Nobility”, which the Constitution forbids. 35 6.

The term “U.S.” as used in these terms implies the District of Columbia 27 corporation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) and no part of any federal territory. You can only have a 28 domicile in this corporation if you are acting as one of it’s officers, because it is a virtual and not a physical entity. 29 This is confirmed by the District of Columbia Act of 1871 , in which the District of Columbia is referred to as a “body 30 corporate” and NOT a “body politic”. 31 Statutes At Large 32 CHAP.

By agreeing to become a trustee of the Social Security Trust and filling out annual profit and loss 11 statements for th at business trust called IRS Form 1040 , you acquire the right to hold and use this publi c property 12 for your use and benefit.

It is illegal to distribute any sums collected by the government under its authority to tax to private persons or to 18 aid private enterprises o r any single person. 19 “To lay, with one hand, the power of the government on the property of the citizen, and with the other to 20 bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes, is none the less a 21 robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation. This is not legislation. It is a decree 22 under legislative forms. 23 Nor is it taxation. ‘A tax,’ says Webster’s Dictionary, ‘is a rate or sum of money assessed on the person or 24 property of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or State.’ ‘Taxes are burdens or charges 25 imposed by the Legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes.’ Cooley, Const. 26 Lim., 479 . 27 Coulter, J., in Northern Liberties v. St. John’s Church, 13 Pa. St., 104 says , very forcibly, ‘I think the common 28 mind has everywhere taken in the understanding that taxes are a public imposition, levied by authority of the 29 government for the purposes of carrying on the government in all its machinery and operations —that they 30 are imposed for a public purpose. ’ See, also Pray v. Northern Liberties, 31 Pa.St., 69 ; Matter of Mayor of 31 N.Y., 11 Johns., 77 ; Camden v. Allen, 2 Dutch., 398 ; Sharpless v. Mayor, supra; Hanson v. Vernon, 27 Ia., 47 ; 32 Whiting v. Fond du Lac, supra.” 33 [Loan Association v. To peka, 20 Wall. 655 (1874) ] 34 3.3. Therefore, the only way you can receive monies from the government such as “social insurance payments” is to 35 act as an employee, officer, or instrumentality of the government providing services in furtherance of a 36 constitutionally authorized function of the government. That is why 5 U.S.C. §552a(a)(13) identifies all 37 recipients of Social Security as “federal personnel”. 38 10.7 How banks become “persons” and “public officers” under federal law 39 31 CFR §202.2 makes “national banks” into officers and agents of the government: 40 TITLE 31 --MONEY AND FINANCE: TREASURY 41 CHAPTER II-- FISCAL SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 42 PART 202_DEPOSITARIES AND FINANCIAL AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \\1 \\ 43 Sec. 202.2 Designations. 44 (a) Financial institutions of the following classes are designated as Depositaries and Financial Agents of the 45 Government [e.g. “public officers”] if they meet the eligibility requirements stated in paragraph (b) of this 46 section: 47 (1) Financial institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 48 (2) Credit unions insured by the National Credit Union 49 Administration. 50"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 116 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ (3) Banks, savings banks, savings and loan, building and loan, and homestead associations, credit unions 1 created under the laws of any State, the deposits or accounts of which are insured by a State or agency thereof 2 or by a corporation chartered by a State for the sole purpose of insuring deposits or accounts of such financial 3 institutions, United States branches of foreign banking corporations authorized by the State in which they are 4 located to transact commercial banking business, and Federal branches of foreign banking corporations, the 5 establishment of which has been approved by the Comptro ller of the Currency. 6 (b) In order to be eligible for designation, a financial institution is required to possess, under its charter and the 7 regulations issued by its chartering authority, either general or specific authority to perform the services 8 outlin ed in Sec. 202.3(b).

Only by 13 participating in a government insurance franchise do they become “public officers” and surrender their sovereign character 14 as private banks to become “public banks” that effectively functi on as part of the machinery of the government. The origin 15 of this source of jurisdiction over banks was admitted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of California Bankers 16 Association v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974) . Congress had just implemented Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) into law 17 for the first time with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and banks sued the government over having to snitch on their 18 depositors and violate their privacy. The Supreme Court held that the authority to violate the rights of depositors who were 19 “public officers” was the bank’s acceptance of FDIC insurance: 20 “The bank plaintiffs somewhat halfheartedly argue, on the basis of the costs which they estimate will be 21 incurred by the banking industry in complying with the Secretary's recordkeeping requirements, that this cost 22 burden alone deprives them of due process of law. They cite no cases for this proposition, and it does not 23 warrant extended treatment. In its complaint filed in the District Court, plaintiff Security National Bank 24 asserted that it was an ‘insured’ nationa l bank; to the extent that Congress has acted to require records on 25 the part of banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or of financial institutions insured 26 under the National Housing Act, Congress is simply imposing a condition on the spending of public funds. 27 See, e.g., Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937) ; Helvering v. 28 Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 57 S.Ct. 904, 81 L.Ed. 1307 (1937) . Since there was no allegation in the complaints filed 29 in the District Court, and since it is not contended here that any bank plaintiff is not covered by FDIC or 30 Housing Act insurance, it is unnecessary to consider what questions would arise had Congress relied solely 31 upon its power over interstate commerce to impose the recordkeeping requirements. The cost burdens imposed 32 on the banks by the recordkeeping requirements are far from unreasonable, and we hold that such burdens 33 do not deny the banks due process of law. 59 ” 34 [California Bankers Ass’n v. Shultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974) ] 35 Notice the important statement: 36 “Congress is simply imposing a cond ition on the spending of public funds. See, e.g., Steward Machine Co. v. 37 Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 57 S.Ct. 883, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937) ; Helvering v.

Shultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974) ] 40 The above two cases are critical, because they concern another franchise, which is Social Security. You may want to read 41 those cases as well. Who are the only people that can spend the “public funds” mentioned by the court above? Ho w about 42 public officers! If you are a PRIVATE depositor of the bank who is not serving in a public office within the government, 43 the requirement contested in the Shultz case above does not apply. Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), IRS Form 8300 , 44 may only be filed against parties engaged in a “trade or business”, and hence expending or managing “public funds”: 45 \" Form 8300 .

Affidavit of William Ehler, App. 24 -25.The hearings before the House Committee on Banking and Currency indicated that the cost of making microfilm copies of checks ranged from 1 1/2 mills per check for small banks down to about 1/2 mill or less for large banks. See House Hearings, supra, n. 1, at 341, 354- 356; H.Rep.No.91 -975 , supra, at 11.

Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000) ] 44 The California Bankers case above is also instructive in that it demonstrates how the government uses one franchise to 45 increase participation in other franchises. FD IC insurance is used as a vehicle to compel banks to file CTRs which are false 46 in the vast majority of cases, but causing the FDIC insurance franchise to be abused unlawfully to recruit more “taxpayer” 47 franchisees under I.R.C. Subtitle A . 48"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 118 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ Hence: 1 1. The only banks subject to federal regulation and therefore “persons” under federal legislation are banks who have 2 voluntarily signed up for a government insurance franchise or privilege such as FDIC insurance. All other banks are 3 PRIVAT E, sovereign, “foreign”, and immune from the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government beast. 4 2. At the point a bank accepts the “benefits” of the insurance franchise or “privilege”, they become: 5 2.1. “National banks” 6 2.2. Public officers 7 2.3. Agents 8 2.4. Fiduciaries 9 2.5. Trustees 10 2.6. “straw men” 11 . . . acting on behalf of the national government as an integral part of the machinery of the government. This is also 12 confirmed by how national banks sue private individuals in state court. They do so from outside the state and put 13 “N A” after their name, meaning “national association”. Therefore, they are suing on behalf of the government and 14 don’t have standing to sue as a private entity in the state. 15 3. Participants in government franchises can lawfully be required to perform the dutie s of their office without direct 16 compensation and without imposing involuntary servitude upon them in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment , as 17 was the case in the California Bankers case above. 18 “The Government urges that the Power Company is estopped to question the validity of the Act creating the 19 Tennessee Valley Authority , and hence that the stockholders, suing in the right of the corporation, cannot [297 20 U.S. 323] maintain this suit. ..... The principle is invoked that one who accepts the benefit of a statute cannot 21 be heard to question its constitutionality. Great Falls Manufacturing Co. v. Attorney General, 124 U.S. 581 ; 22 Wall v. Parrot Silver & Copper Co., 244 U.S. 407; St. Louis Casting Co. v. Prendergast Construction Co., 23 260 U.S. 469. “ 24 [Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288 (1936) ] 25 The compensation the banks receive under the FDIC insurance franchise is deemed by the courts to be sufficient to not 26 require additional direct monetary compensation to subsidize compliance with any new specific regulatory requirement 27 arising out of the relationship. In effect, the government can impose as many uncompensated requirements as they 28 wish under the terms of the FDIC insurance franchise agreement and the only option or recourse that franchisee banks 29 have is to compare the costs with the benefits and decide to terminate participation when the c osts of compliance 30 outweigh the benefits of the FDIC insurance. 31 4. The requirement to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) may only be enforced against the banks in the case of 32 “public officers” engaged in the “trade or business” franchise within the national and not state government. They may 33 not lawfully be filled out against a private party not so engaged and if they are anyway, a crime has been committed. 34 Thi s requirement is thoroughly documented in the following form ready made to present to your bank: 35 Demand for Verified Evidence of “Trade or Business” Activity: Currency Transaction Report , Form #04.008 http://sedm.org/Forms/Form Index.htm Like everything else the government does, even FDIC insurance is a SCAM with a capital “S”. Most people don’t realize 36 that if a bank fails, the government by law has 100 years to pay back all the depositors with inflated dollars! Therefore, 37 such insurance is not of any real value anyway. 38 Let’s review how the three criteria for the existence of the “straw man” are satisfied in the case of the Bank Secrecy Act: 39 4. Commercial transaction: 40 4.1. FDIC insurance. 41 4.2. Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) , IRS Form 8300. Prepared when public officers engaged in the “trade or 42 business” franchise withdraw public funds from financial institutions. These reports are NOT applicable to 43 private parties or even most parties. 44 5. Agency. 45 5.1. 31 CFR §202.2 makes banks that accept FDIC insurance into agents of the government. 46 5.2.

It constitutes involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment for the government to impose any 1 duty on the bank, including the duty to prepare CTRs. 2 6.2.

It quotes two and only two exceptions to this rule, which are: 21 1. A person acting in a representative capacity as an officer of a federal entity. 22 2. A corporation that was created and is domiciled within federal territory. 23 This means that if a person is domiciled within the exclusive jurisdiction of a state of th e Union and not within a federal 24 enclave, then state law are the rules of decision rather than federal law. Since state income tax liability in nearly every state 25 is dependent on a federal liability first, this makes an income tax liability impossible for those domiciled outside the federal 26 zone or inside the exclusive jurisdiction of a state, because such persons cannot be statutory “U.S. citizens” as defined in 8 27 U.S.C. §1401 nor “residents” as defined i n 26 U.S.C. §7701(b)(1)(A) . 28 IV.

Property being acquired or transferred that would otherwise be illegal: 3 3.1. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes privacy a protected right. 4 3.2. In law, all rights are “property”. Th erefore, privacy is “ property ” and control over information about oneself is 5 also property. 6 3.3. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to take away control of information about oneself and to authorize anyone 7 indicated in the act to look at private information abou t someone. The act is found in Title 5 of the U.S. Code , 8 and hence it only regulates the privacy of “government employees” and not private Americans in states of the 9 Union generally. 10 3.4. Therefore, those who work for the government essentially must give up their right to privacy as a precondition of 11 their employment agreement. They exchange privacy for their employment “wages”. When they go to work for 12 the government, they implicitly surrender their private status and thei r official actions then become 13 administratively discoverable through the Privacy Act and/or the Freedom of Information Act without the n eed 14 for litigation to institute legal discovery. That is why they are called “public employees”. Otherwise, they would 15 be “private employees”. 16 “ The restrictions that the Constitution places upon the government in its capacity as lawmaker, i.e., as the 17 regulator of private conduct, are not the same as the restrictions that it places upon the government in its 18 capacity as employer. We have recognized this in many contexts, with respect to many different constitutional 19 guarantees. Private citizens perhaps ca nnot be prevented from wearing long hair, but policemen can.

All of those 34 regulations fall within part 301 of 26 CFR. Part 301 is published under the authority of 5 U.S.C. §301 , which empowers 35 the Secr etary to write regulations for the management of his department. These regulations may NOT impose duties on the 36 general public, but only upon those working within the department: 37 TITLE 5 > PART I > CHAPTER 3 > § 301 38 § 301. Departmental regulations 39 The head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations for the government of 40 his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, 41 use, and preservation of its records, papers, and property. This section does n ot authorize withholding 42 information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public. 43 Hence, the requirement to use Taxpayer Identification Numbers ONLY applies to Treasury employees, and not to the 44 general public and certainly not t o the income tax. If that requirement ALSO applied to the general public OR to the 45 income tax , it would ALSO be found in Part 1 of the regulations and be published in the Federal Register as required by 5 46 U.S.C. §553 (a) and 44 U.S.C. §1505(a). Hence, once again, TINs are only for use by the public officer “straw man” and 47 not the private person, like nearly everything the government does. 48 The straw man is a franchisee en gaged in privileged activities with an effective domicile on federal territory. The older 49 versions of the regulations admit that this straw man acquires an effective domicile or “residence” on federal territory by 50 engaging in the “trade or business” franc hise: 51 26 CFR §301.7701 -5 Domestic, foreign, resident, and nonresident persons. 52"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 122 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ A domestic corporation is one organized or created in the United States, including only the States (and during 1 the periods when not States, the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii), and the District of Columbia, or under the 2 law of the United States or of any State or Territory.

The reason you must do this is because 16 you are only eligible for the benefits if you are domiciled or resident on federal territory and therefore within the legislative 17 jurisdiction of congress. 18 The instructions for IRS Form 1042- s indicate all the cir cumstances where “Taxpayer Identification Numbers” are 19 absolutely required. The TIN functions as a de facto license to engage in federal franchises and the occasions where this 20 license is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED identify what the franchises are that which are subject to said license.

The average American is not engaged in any thing 7 that has to do with the U.S. government. It is only by the abuse of “words of art” to deceive them that they can even 8 become connected with the U.S. government. 9 26 U.S.C. §871 confirms that only earnings from sources within the “United States” (District of Columbia pursu ant to 26 10 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) ) are subject to tax in the case of a nonresident alien. People domiciled in states of the 11 Union are nonresident aliens because they are outside of the legislative jurisd iction of Congress: 12 “It is no longer open to question that the general government, unlike the states , Hammer v.

Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 , 56 S.Ct. 855 (1936) ] 16 \"The difficulties arising out of our dual form of government and the opportunities for differing opinions 17 concerning the relative rights of state and national governments are many; but for a very long time this court 18 has steadfastly adhered to the doctrine that the taxing power of Congress does not extend to the states or 19 their political subdivisions . The same basic reasoning which leads to that conclusion, we think, requires like 20 limitation upon the power which springs from the bankruptcy clause. United States v. Butler, supra.\" 21 [Ashton v. Cameron County Water Improvement District No. 1, 298 U.S. 51 3, 56 S.Ct. 892 (1936) ] 22 All of the activities for which Taxpayer Identification Numbers are required involve privileged activities and the Taxpayer 23 Identification Number acts as the de facto license to engage in the activity. Of such licenses, the U.S. Supreme Court has 24 said that Congress may not “autho rize”, meaning “license” ANY ACTIVITY, including the “trade or business” franchise, 25 within a state of the Union: 26 “Thus, Congress having power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and 27 with the Indian tribes, may, without doubt, provide for granting coasting licenses , licenses to pilots, licenses to 28 trade with the Indians, and any other licenses necessary or proper for the exercise of that great and extensive 29 power; and the same observation is applicable to every other power of Congress, to the exercise of which the 30 granting of licenses may be incident. All such licenses confer authority, and give rights to the licensee. 31 But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States . Over th is 32 commerce and trade Congress has no power of regulation nor any direct control . This power belongs 33 exclusively to the States. No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted within a State is 34 warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental to the exercise of powers clearly granted to 35 the legislature . The power to authorize [e.g. “license”] a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the 36 exclusive power of the State over the same subject. It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very 37 extensive power. It is given in the Constitution, with only one exception and only two qualifications. Congress 38 cannot tax exports, and it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the r ule 39 of uniformity. Thus limited, and thus only, it reaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion. But, it 40 reaches only existing subjects. Congress cannot authorize a trade or business 41 within a State in order to tax it. ” 42 [License Tax Cases, 72 U.S. 462 , 18 L.Ed. 497, 5 Wall. 462, 2 A.F.T.R. 2224 (1866) ] 43 Let’s review how the three criteria for the existence of the “straw man” are satisfied in the case of the Taxpayer 44 Identification Numbers: 45 1.

Persons using said numbers therefore become “public officers” when in possession of public property. The very 1 essence of being a “public officer” is management over public property. See the definit ion of “public officer” 2 below for proof: 3 “ Public office .

State v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St. 33. 29 N.E. 593. 15 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Four th Edition, p. 1235 ] 16 2.3. Through the mechanism of: 17 2.3.1. The Internal Revenue Code, the IRS issues “public property” called a Taxpayer Identification Number to a 18 private person and deputizes that person in possession to become a public officer managing said property 19 under the authority of 26 U.S.C. §6109 and the regulations thereunder. 20 2.3.2. The Social Security Act, the SSA issues “public property” called a Social Security Number to a private 21 person and deputizes that person in possession to become a public officer managing said property under the 22 authority of the Social Security Act. The Social Security C ard is proof of employment with the federal 23 government and the owner is a “Kelly Girl” on loan to their private employer. 24 3. Property being acquired or transferred that would otherwise be illegal: 25 3.1. It is unlawful for a private person to use public property for their own private and personal benefit. This is called 26 theft and embezzlement. 27 3.2. Social Security payments may only be sent to the public officer in control of the card and the number that are also 28 public property. The number and the card act as a de facto “license” to receive federal “benefit” payments from 29 the Treasury. It is illegal for those not in posse ssion of said “license” to receive a payment. These payments 30 effectively act as compensation to the “trustee”, who is the public officer or “federal p ersonnel” (5 U.S.C. 31 §552a(a)(13) ) receiving the payment. 32 “To lay, with one hand, the power of the government on the property of the citizen [in the guise of “taxes”], 33 and with the other to bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private 34 fortunes, is none the less a robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation. This is 35 not legislation. It is a decree under legislative forms. 36 Nor is it taxation. ‘A tax,’ says Webster’s Dictionary, ‘is a rate or sum of money assessed on the person or 37 property of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or State.’ ‘Taxes are burdens or charges 38 imposed by the Legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes.’ Cooley, Const. 39 Lim., 479. 40 Coulter, J., in Northern Liberties v. St. John’s Church, 13 Pa. St., 104 says, very forcibly, ‘I think the common 41 mind has everywhere taken in the understanding that taxes are a public imposition, levied by authority of the 42 government for the purposes of carrying on the government in all its machinery and operations —that they 43 are imposed for a public purpose. ’ See, also Pray v. Northern Liberties, 31 Pa.St., 69 ; Matter of Mayor of 44 N.Y., 11 Johns., 77 ; Camden v. Allen, 2 Dutch., 398 ; Sharpless v. Mayor, supra; Hanson v. Vernon, 27 Ia., 47 ; 45 Whiting v.

IRS refund checks may only be sent to public officers called “taxpayers” in receipt, custody, and control of all the 48 Taxpayer Identification Number and all property and rights to property that attach to the number at financial 49 institutions. All private property associated with the number beco mes private property donated to a public use to 50 procure the benefits of the “trade or business” franchise.

Levy may be made upon the accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official, of 17 the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the 18 District of Columbia, by serving a notice of levy on the employer (as defined in section 3401(d)) of such 19 officer, employee, or elected official.

IRS Form 668(Y)(c ) Notice of Lien is mailed to the last know n address of the “person” and to the country recorder at 29 the last known address. This notice includes a column (a) indicating “Kind of Tax”. This column represents the 30 Internal Revenue Code sectio n from which the authority to impose the lien derives. It does NOT represent the form 31 number, but the I.R.C. code section. See: 32 http://sedm.org/SampleLetters/Federal/S ituational/IRS -668Yc -050504.pdf 33 4.

Which means that their correspondence can only be directed at a public officer or 19 government entity and not a private person. IRS is NOT empowered to correspond with anyone other than fellow 20 government instrumentalities, agencies, bureaus, and “employees”. That is why they are a “bureau” rather than an 21 “agency” by the admis sion of no less than the Dept. of Justice : Because bureaus service only other government entities and 22 do not interact directly with the public.

The upper left corner of the form indicates “Employee Withholding Allowance Certificate”. 27 2. The t erm “employee” is statutorily defined as follows: 28 2.1. In 5 U.S.C. §2105 it means a public officer. 29 2.2. In 26 U.S.C. §3401(c ) and 26 CFR §31.3401(c ) -1 it is defined as an officer or instrumentality of the United 30 States. 31 3. Submission of the form causes IRS form W -2’s to be filed in the name of the submitter connecting the submitter to a 32 “trade or business” pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §6041(a) . 33 4. A “trade or business ” is defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26) as “the functions of a public office”. 34 5. 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(31) indicates that any estate that is not connected to a “public office”/”trade or business” is a 35 foreign estate not subject to the Internal Revenue Code. 36 6. It is ILLEGAL to file information returns against a person who is not engaged in a “public o ffice”.

For instance, they will send IRS Letter 2800C directing the private employer to disregard the 8 exemptions claimed if they are excessive. See: 9 IRS Letter 2800C http://sedm.org/SampleLetters/Federal/Letters/IRS - LTR2800C.pdf If you examine the lower right corner of this notice, you will find the following conspicuous language: 10 For In ternal Use Only XXX -XX -XXXX 11 The phrase “Internal Use” refers to the GOVERNMENT, but they very conveniently don’t tell you that and won’t answer 12 questions about what “internal” means. This is confirmed by the fact that: 13 1. The return address has printed below it “Penalty for Private Use $300”. The opposite of private is public. Which 14 means that their correspondence can only be directed at a public officer or government entity and not a private person. 15 2. The notice also does not have a valid OMB control number, which means that it can impose no obligation on the part 16 of anyone other than a government entity . This is confirmed by the Paperwork Reduction Act at 44 U.S.C. §3412, 17 which says that a private person not in the government cannot be penalized for failure to comply with a request for 18 specific information. 19 10.15 Tax Court and IRS Notices of Deficiency are directed ONLY at the “Straw Man” 20 IRS Notices of Deficiency (NOD) , Letters 3219 and 531 come with a direction that you must petition the tax court if you 21 don't agree with the \"assessed\" amount in the NOD. 22 23 1.

See: 24 Why the Government Can't Lawfully Assess Human Beings With an Income Tax Liability Without Their Consent , Form #05.011 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 2. The notice contains a PROPOSED assessment subject to ratification by the “taxpayer” , not a legally binding 25 obligation. This was confirmed by the IRS itself in a letter to the Government Accounting Office (GAO): 26 “In its response to this letter, IRS officials indicated that they do not generally prepare actual tax returns. 27 Instead, IRS prepares substitute documents that propose [not MAKE] assessments . Although IRS and 28 legislation refer to this as the substitute for return program, these officials said the document does not look like 29 an actual tax return.” 30 [Government Accounting Office Report GAO/GGD -00- 60R, p. 1, Footnote 1; 31 SOURCE: http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/repandtest.html ] 32 “[IRS] Customer Service Division official commented on the phrase ‘Substitute for Return.’ They asked us to 33 emphasize that even though the program is commonly referred to as the SFR program, no actual tax return is 34 prepared .” 35 [Government Accounting Office Report GAO/GGD- 00- 60R, p. 2 ; 36 SOURCE: http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/repandtest.html ] 37 38 3. 26 CFR §601.105 requires that t he “taxpayer” is supposed to be offered an opportunity to consent to the proposed 39 assessment appearing on these bogus notices BEFORE they become legally enforceable.

The “transferee” is a “ public officer” acting as a fiduciary/agent over “taxpayer ”/government property . The 29 “transferee” is \"the one to whom a transfer is made (Black's 6th)\". This would seem to be the “employer ”/“withholding 30 agent ” (26 U.S.C. §§3401(d) and 7701(a)(16) ) via the IRS Form W -4...who is the one to whom the worker transfers 31 his/her property (money) so the transferee can send it to the IRS. 32 2.

As we h ave proven throughout this 23 document, the “straw man” is: 24 1. Created through your right to contract with others. 25 2. A “public office” within the government . 26 3. A product of your explicit (in writing) or implicit (by act ion or omission) “consent” to occupy said office. 27 4. A creation of the government subject to government control and regulation. 28 Franchises are euphemistically called “public rights” by the U.S. Supreme Court. To wit: 29 “The distinction between public rights and private rights has not been definitively explained in our 30 precedents. 60 Nor is it necessary to do so in the present cases, for it suffices to observe that a matter of public 31 rights must at a minimum arise “between the government and others.” Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451, 32 49 S.Ct., at 413. 61 In contrast, “the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined,” Crowell v. 33 Benson, supra, at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292, is a matter of private rights . Our precedents clearly establish that only 34 controversies in the former category may be removed from Art. III courts and delegated to legislative courts 35   60 Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) , attempted to catalog some of the matters that fall within the public- rights doctrine: “Familiar illustrations of administrative agencies created for the determination of such matters are found in connection with the exercise of the congressional power as to interstate and foreign commerce, taxation, immigration, the public lands, public h ealth, the facilities of the post office, pensions and payments to veterans.” Id. , at 51, 52 S.Ct., at 292 (footnote omitted). 61 Congress cannot “withdraw from [ Art. III] judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature , is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.” Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co. , 18 How. 272, 284 (18 56) (emphasis added). It is thus clear that the presence of the United States as a p roper party to the proceeding is a necessary but not sufficient means of distinguishing “private rights” from “public rights. ” And it is also clear that even with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the “public rights” doctrine, the p resumption is in favor of Art. III courts. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok , 370 U.S., at 548 -549, and n. 21, 82 S.Ct., at 1471- 1472, and n. 21 (opinion of Harlan, J.). See also Currie, The Federal Courts and the American Law Institute, Part 1, 36 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 13 -14, n. 67 (1968). Moreover, when Congress assigns these matters to administrative agencies, or to legislative courts, it has generally provided, and we have suggested that it may be required to provide, for Art. III judicial review. See Atlas Roofing Co. v.

Moreover, such a distinction seems 9 to us to be necessary in light of the delicate accommo dations required by the principle of separation of powers 10 reflected in Art. III . The constitutional system of checks and balances is designed to guard against 11 “encroachment or aggrandizement” by Congress at the expense of the other bran ches of government. Buc kley 12 v. Valeo , 424 U.S., at 122, 96 S.Ct., at 683. . But when Congress creates a statutory right [a “privilege” in this 13 case, such as a “trade or business”], it clearly has the discretion, in defining that right, to create presumptions, 14 or assign burdens of proof, or prescribe remedies; it may also provide that persons seeking to vindicate that 15 right must do so before particularized tribunals created to perform the specialized adjudicative tasks related to 16 that right. FN35 Such provisions do, in a sense, affect the exercise of judicial power, but they are also incidental 17 to Congress' power to define the right that it has created. No comparable justification exists, however, when the 18 right being adjudicated is not of congressional creation. In such a situation, substantial inroads into functions 19 that have traditionally been performed by the Judiciary cannot be characterized merely as incidental extensions 20 of Congress' power to define rights that it has created. Rather, such inroads suggest unwarranted 21 encroachments upon the judicial power of the United States, which our Constitution reserves for Art. II I courts. 22 [Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. at 83- 84, 102 S.Ct. 2858 (1983) ] 23 11.1 Proving consent that creates the “straw man” in court 24 The terms “public right” as used in the preceding section and “privilege” are synonymous. You become eligible to partake 25 of the “privilege” or “public right” by consenting to the franchise agreement. Examples of how that consent is procured 26 include, but are not limited to, the following: 27 1. Filling out a government application. Such an “application” really constitutes “begging” for government benefits. You 28 are a beggar and a vagabond who can’t govern and support himself so you are asking the government to subsidize your 29 idleness. See: 30 The Government “Benefits” Scam , Form #05.040 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 2. Filling out a n SSA Form SS- 5 Application for a Social Security Card . 31 3. Applying for government employment. 32 4. Tax returns: 33 4.1. Signing an IRS Form 1040 tax return . Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 1 and 3 of the United States Constitution 34 delegates ONLY to Cong ress the authority to “lay and collect”, meaning “assess” taxes. That power cannot be 35 delegated to any other branch of the government, and certainly not to the Executive Branch. The courts recognize 36 tax returns as an assessment, which makes the filer int o a “public officer” within the Legislative Branch of the 37 government and therefore a “straw man” and a franchisee. 38 4.2. Taking deductions on the return. Everything that goes on such a “return” is earnings connected with the “trade or 39 business” franchise. 26 U .S.C. §162 says you can only take deductions on this form if you are in fact engaged in 40 the “trade or business” franchise. Every attempt to avoid the liabilities of the franchise by taking deductions in 41 effect ropes you further i nto the franchise. Everything you take deductions against becomes private property 42 donated to a public use to procure the benefits of a federal franchise. 43 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit o f happiness;' 44 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 45 man has honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 46 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does not mean that he must use it for his 47 neighbor's benefit [e.g. SOCIAL SECURITY, Medicare, and every other 48 public “benefit”]; second, that if he devotes it to a public use, he gives to the public a right to 49 control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it upon payment of 50 due compensation .” 51 [Budd v.

The application for any ki nd of “license” is evidence of consent to surrender all rights 6 adversely impacted by making such application. 7 6. Filling out a marriage license application. This creates a trust relation and a franchise where the spouses become 8 “trustees” and the government becomes the grantor and beneficiary . The “corpus” of the trust is the community 9 property within the marriage, including the children, who are now “wards of the state” instead of the parents : 10 [4] In all domestic concerns each state of the Union is to be deemed an independent sovereignty.

[7] Not only is a divorce of California [81 Cal.App.2d 880] residents 21 by a court of another state void because of the plaintiff's lack of bona fide residence in the foreign state, but it is 22 void also for lack of the court's jurisdiction over the State of California.

Not only can the litigants by 24 their collusion not confer jur isdiction upon Nevada courts over themselves but neither can they confer such 25 jurisdiction over this state. 26 [9] It therefore follows that a judgment of divorce by a court of Nevada without first having pursuant to its own 27 laws acquired... 28 [Roberts v. Roberts, 81 Cal.App.2d 871 [Civ. No. 15818. Second Di st., Div. Two. Oct. 17, 1947 ] 29 __________________________________________________________________________________________ 30 JUSTICE MAAG delivered the opin ion of the court: This action was brought in April of 1993 by Carolyn and 31 John West (grandparents) to obtain visitation rights with their grandson, Jacob Dean West. Jacob was born 32 January 27, 1992. He is the biological son of Ginger West and Gregory West, Carolyn and John's deceased 33 son... 34 However, this constitutionally protected parental interest is not wholly without limit or beyond regulation. 35 Prince v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 88 L. Ed. 645, 64 S. Ct. 438, 442 (1944) . \"[T]he 36 state has a wide range of power for li miting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child's 37 welfare.\" Prince, 321 U.S. at 167, 88 L. Ed. 645, 64 S. Ct. at 442. In fact, the entire familial relationship 38 involves the State . When two people decide to get married, they are required to first procure a license from 39 the State. If they have children of this marriage, they are required by the State to sub mit their children to 40 certain things, such as school attendance and vaccinations. Furthermore, if at some time in the future the 41 couple decides the marriage is not working, they must petition the State for a divorce. Marriage is a three- 42 party contract betw een the man, the woman, and the State. Linneman v. Linneman, 1 Ill. App. 2d 48, 50, 116 43 N.E.2d 182, 183 (1953), citing Van Koten v. Van Koten, 323 Ill. 323, 326, 154 N.E. 146 (1926) . The State 44 represents the public interest in the institution of marriage. Linneman, 1 Ill. App. 2d at 50, 116 N.E.2d at 45 183. This public interest is what allows the State to intervene in certain situations to protect the interests of 46 members of the family. The State is like a silent partner in the family who is not active in the everyday 47 running of the family but becomes active and exercises its power and authority only when necessary to 48 protect some important interest of family life. Taking all of this into consideration, the question no longer is 49 whether the State has an interest or place in disputes such as the one at bar, but it becomes a question of timing 50 and necessity. Has the State intervened too early or perhaps intervened where no intervention was warranted? 51 This question then directs our discussion to an analysis of the provision of the Act that allows the challenged 52 State intervention (750 ILCS 5/607(b) (West 1996)). 53 [West v. West, 689 N.E.2d 1215 (1998) ] 54 It is important to know how our property becomes connected with the franchise because all disputes in court relating to the 55 “stra w man” will relate to this property.

All franchises are contracts and therefore are “property”. 3 American Jurisprudence Legal Encyclopedia 2d 4 Franchises, §2: As a Contract 5 It is generally conceded that a franchise is the subject of a contract between the grantor and the grantee, and 6 that it does in fact constitute a contract when the requisite element of a consideration is present. 62 7 Conversely, a franchise granted without consideration is not a contract binding upon the state. 63 It is 8 generally considered that the obligation resting upon the grantee to comply with the terms and conditions of the 9 grant constitutes a sufficient consideration. 64 As expressed by some authorities, the benefit to the community 10 may constitute the sole consideration for the grant of a franchise by a state. 65 11 A contract thus created has the same status as any other contract recognized by the law; 66 it is binding 12 mutually upon the grantor and the grantee and is enforceable according to its terms and tenor, 67 and is 13 entitled to be protected from impairment by legislative action under the provision of the state and federal 14 constitutions prohibiting the passage of any law by which the obligation of existing contracts shall be impaired 15 or lessened. 68 The well- established rule as to franchises is that where a municipal corporation, acting within 16 its powers, enacts an ordinance conferring rights and privil eges on a person or corporation, and the grantee 17 accepts the ordinance and expends money in availing itself of the rights and privileges so conferred, a contract 18 is thereby created which, in the absence of a reserved power to amend or repeal the ordinance, cannot be 19 impaired by a subsequent municipal enactment. 69 Certain limitations upon this general rule, and particular 20 applications thereof, are discussed in the following section. 21   62 Larson v.

Any of your prope rty that you connect to the franchise becomes “property” of the franchise itself. That donation 4 process occurs by attaching the franchise license number, which is the Social Security Number or Taxpayer 5 Identification Number, to your private property. All property so associated becomes “private property donated to a 6 public use to procure the benefits of a government franchise”. 7 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' 8 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 9 man has honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 10 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does no t mean that he must use it for his neighbor's benefit; second, 11 that if he devotes it to a public use, he gives to the public a right to 12 control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it upon 13 payment of due compensa tion. 14 [Budd v.

A franchise with the government makes all property connected with the government into “public property” controlled 16 by the “public office” instead of the private person who formerly owned it . 17 11.2 Franchise (property) courts 18 If any dispute arises under the franchise agreement, the franchise agreement normally specif ies that the dispute must be 19 heard in a what we call a “property court”. For instance, all federal district and circuit courts are “property” courts 20 established pursuant to Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, which states: 21 Un ited States Constitution 22 Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 23 The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the 24 Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so 25 construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. 26 Federal district and circuit courts are NOT Article III constitutional cour ts, but simply property courts. This fact is 27 exhaustively proven in the following book: 28 What Happened to Justice? , Form #06.012 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm For an example of why federal district and circuit courts are Article IV courts, we need look no further than the federal 29 judge’s oath. The judge oath is prescribed in 28 U.S.C. §453 and 5 U.S.C. §33 31 and all federal judges take the same oath . 30 The oath that all judges take is a combination of these two code sections and reads as follows: 31 “I, _______, do solemnly swear and affirm that I will administer justice without regar d to persons and do 32 equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all of the 33 duties incumbent upon me as ______________ under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that I 34 will suppor t and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I 35 will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I take this obligation freely without any mental 36 reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I wil l well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I 37 am about to enter. So help me God.” 38 The federal judge oath says that they will “administer justice without regard to persons”. If they don’t “regard p ersons”, 39 then they can’t care abou t the Constitutional rights of such “persons”. Practical experience litigating in federal court has 40   70 The grant resulting from the acceptance, by the establishment of a plant devoted to the prescribed public use, of the state's offer to permit persons or corporations duly incorporated for the purpose \"in any city where there are no public works owned and controlled by the munic ipality for supplying the same with water or artificial light,\" to lay pipes in the city streets for the purpose specified, constitutes a contract and vests in the accepting individual or corporation a property right protected by the Federal Constitution against impairment.

Those participating in federal franchises, in fact, don’t have any rights, but only statutorily 2 granted privileges or “public rights”. 3 It is VERY important that even property courts such as federal district and circuit courts cannot proceed without you r 4 consent: 5 1. They are officiating over a franchise and all franchises are property. 6 2. The ONLY way that a specific franchise agreement could lawfully become “property” in the first place is through a 7 legally enforceable contract or agreement you expressly or i mpliedly consented to, usually in writing. Rights are not 8 conveyed to the government without express or implied consent. 9 3. In any litigation involving a franchise, the first step in the litigation must include proving you are subject to the 10 franchise agreem ent. In a tax case, for instance, the court would need to show that you are a franchisee called a 11 “taxpayer” as legally defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(14) and 26 U.S.C. §1313 . 12 4. The court cannot la wfully officiate over any dispute until you consent to their jurisdiction by making an “appearance” 13 in the matter, which is legally defined as consenting to the jurisdiction of the court: 14 appearance . A coming into court as a party to a suit, either in per son or by attorney, whether as plaintiff or 15 defendant. The formal proceeding by which a defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court. The 16 voluntary submission to a court's jurisdiction . 17 In civil actions the parties do not normally actually appear in person, but rather through their attorneys (who 18 enter their appearance by filing written pleadings, or a formal written entry of appearance). Also, at many 19 stages of criminal proceedings, particularly involving minor offenses, the defendant's attorney appears on his 20 behalf. See e.g., Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 . 21 An appearance may be either general or special ; the former is a simple and unqualified or unrestricted 22 submission to the jurisdiction of the court, the latter is a submission to the jurisdiction for some specific 23 purpose only, not for all the purposes of the suit. A special appearance is for the purpose of testing or objecting 24 to the sufficiency of service or the jurisdiction of the court over defendant without submitting to such 25 jurisdiction; a general appearance is made where the defendant waives defects of service and submits to the 26 jurisdiction of court. Insurance Co. of North America v. Kunin, 175 Neb. 260, 121 N.W.2d 372, 375, 376. 27 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 97 ] 28 The party seeking to enforce a right under a franchise agreement in a court of law therefore has the burden of proving that 29 you as the defendant or respondent did one or more of t he following: 30 1. Expressly consented to the franchise agreement in writing at some point. 31 2. Never denied that you were engaged in the franchise. 32 3. Described yourself as a “franchisee” such as a “taxpayer”. 33 4. Are in possession, use, or control of the franchise license number called a Social Security Number or Taxpayer 34 Identification Number. 35 5. Waived sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act by either: 36 5.1. Engaging in any of the activities described in 28 U.S.C. §1605 OR . . . 37 5.2. By declaring yourself to be a “citizen” under the law of the foreign sovereign pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1603(b)(3) . 38 6. Availed yourself of the “benefits” of the franchise by accepting payments in connection with it. 39 CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 40 DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS 41 PART 2. CONTRACTS 42 CHAPTER 3. CONSENT 43 Section 1589 44 45 1589. A voluntary acceptance of the benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations 46 arising from it, so far as the facts are known, or ought to be known, to the person accepting. 47 Absent one or more of the above, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty, which means you are not a franchisee 48 such as a “taxpayer” and cannot lawfully become the target of enforcement by the court. 49 The pres umption of innocence plays a unique role in criminal proceedings. As Chief Justice Burger explained 50 in his opinion for the Court in Estelle v. Williams, 4 25 U.S. 501 (1976) : [507 U.S. 284]: 51"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 137 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ The presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component 1 of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice. Long ago this Court stated: 2 The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, 3 axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of th e administration of our 4 criminal law. Coffin v. United States, 156 U.S. 432, 453 (1895) . 5 To implement the presumption, courts must be alert to factors that may undermine the fairness of the factfinding 6 process. In the administration of criminal justice, courts must carefully guard against dilution of the principle 7 that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.

Lashely, 507 U.S. 27 2 (1993) ] 10 11.3 Proceedings against “straw man” are “in rem” 11 Any proceeding involving the enforcement of any provisions of the franchise agreement in court is always a gainst the “res”. 12 The “res”, in turn, is the collection of all rights that attach to the “public office” and the franchise license which create s the 13 office: 14 Res . Lat. The subject matter of a trust or will. In the civil law, a thing; an object. As a te rm of the law, this 15 word has a very wide and extensive signification, including not only things which are objects of property, but 16 also such as are not capable of individual ownership. And in old English law it is said to have a general 17 import, comprehend ing both corporeal and incorporeal things of whatever kind, nature, or species. By \" res,\" 18 according to the modern civilians, is meant everything that may form an object of rights, in opposition to 19 \"persona,\" which is regarded as a subject of rights. \"Res ,\" therefore, in its general meaning, comprises actions 20 of all kinds; while in its restricted sense it comprehends every object of right, except actions. This has reference 21 to the fundamental division of the Institutes that all law relates either to perso ns, to things, or to actions. 22 Res is everything that may form an object of rights and includes an object, subject -matter or status . In re 23 Riggle's Will, 11 A.D.2d 51 205 N.Y.S.2d 19, 21, 22. The term is particularly applied to an object, subject- 24 matter, or status , considered as the defendant in an action, or as an object against which, directly, 25 proceedings are taken. Thus, in a prize case, the captured vessel is \"the res\"; and proceedi ngs of this 26 character are said to be in rem. (See In personam; In Rem.) \"Res\" may also denote the action or proceeding, 27 as when a cause, which is not between adversary parties, it entitled \"In re ______\" 28 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, pp. 1304- 1306 ] 29 In law, any proceeding that is against a “res” or “license” is called “in rem”. 30 In rem. A technical term used to designate proceedings or actions instituted against the thing, in 31 contradistinction to personal actions, which are said to be in personam. 32 “In rem” proceedings encompass any action brought against person in which essential purpose of suit is to 33 determine title to or to affect interest in specific property located within territo ry over which court has 34 jurisdiction. Re Mine ex rel. Liley v. District Court for City and County of Denver, Colo., 709 P.2d 1379, 1382. 35 It is true that, in a strict sense, a proceeding in rem is one taken directly against property, and has for its object 36 the disposition of property, without reference to title of individual claimants; but, in a larger and more general 37 sense, the terms are applied to actions between parties, where the direct object is to reach and dispose of 38 property owned by them, or of some interest therein. Such are cases commenced by attachment against the 39 property of debtors, or instituted to partition real estate, foreclose a mortgage, or enforce a lien. Pennoyer v. 40 Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565. I n the strict sense of the term, a proceeding “in rem” is one which is taken 41 directly against property or one which is brought to enforce a right in the thing itself. 42 Actions in which the court is required to have control of the thing or object and which an adjudication is made 43 as to the object which binds the whole world and not simply the interests of the parties to the proceeding. 44 Flesch v. Circle City Excavating & Rental Corp., 137 Ind.App. 695, 210 N.E.2d 865. 45 See also in personam; In rem jurisdiction; Quasi in rem jurisdiciton. 46 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 793 ] 47 An example of an “in rem” proceeding involving a franchise would be an action for a divorce, which is a n action to 48 extinguish the “res” or marriage “license”. 49 It is universally conceded that a divorce proceeding, in so far as it affects the status of the parties, is an 50 action in rem. 19 Cor. Jur. 22, § 24; 3 Freeman on Judgments (5th Ed.) 3152. It is usually said that the 51 ‘marriage status' is the res. Both parties to the marriage, and the state of the residence of each party to the 52 marriage, has an interest in the marriage status. In order that any court may obtain jurisdiction over an action 53"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 138 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ for divorce that court must in some way get jurisdiction over the res (the marriage status). The early cases 1 assumed that such jurisdiction was obtained when the petitioning party was properly domiciled in the 2 jurisdiction. Ditson v. Ditson, 4 R. I. 87, is the leading case so holding; see, also, Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 3 14, 23 S.Ct. 237, 47 L.Ed. 366. Until 1905 the overwhelming weight of authority was to the effect that, if the 4 petitioning party was domiciled in good faith in any state, that state could render a divorce decree on 5 constructive service valid not only in the state of its rendition, but which would be recognized everywhere. In 6 Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.S. 155, 21 S.Ct. 544, 45 L.Ed. 794, the United States Supreme Court apparently 7 recognized that doctrine. In that case the parties were living together and domiciled in Kentucky. That state was 8 the last state where the parties lived together as husband and wife. The wife left the husband and came to and 9 became domiciled in **721 New York. She brought an action for divorce in New York, her husband defending 10 on the ground that he had secured a divorce in Kentucky on constructive service. New York refused to recognize 11 the validity of the Kentucky decree, on the ground that Kentucky could not in such an action affect the status of 12 a citizen of New York. The United States Supreme Court reversed the New York decisions ( 82 Hun, 179, 31 N. 13 Y. S. 977; Id. 155 N. Y. 129, 49 N. E. 933, 40 L. R. A. 291, 63 Am. St. Rep. 650) and *33 held that the Kentucky 14 decree was entitled to full faith and credit even though the wife was not served with process and not appear in 15 the Kentucky action, and even though at the time the decree was rendered the wife was a resident of and 16 domiciled in New York. In so holding, however, the court pointed out that the reason the Kentucky decree was 17 entitled to full faith and cr edit was because Kentucky had jurisdiction over the marriage status by virtue of the 18 fact that that state was the matrimonial domicile, i. e., the last place the parties lived together as husband and 19 wife. Then in 1905, the United States Supreme Court decided the Haddock Case, supra. Here the parties were 20 married and domiciled in the state of New York. The husband, without cause, abandoned his wife and went to 21 and acquired a domicile in Connecticut. Thereafter the husband secured in Connecticut a divorce on 22 constructive service. Several years later the wife sued for divorce in New York, and secured personal service on 23 the husband. The husband set up as a defense the Connecticut decree. New York refused to recognize it. The 24 Supreme Court of the United States held that although the Connecticut decree was probably good in that state, 25 it was without binding force in New York, and was not entitled to full faith and credit. The court pointed out that 26 the matrimonial domicile of the parties was New York, and that in such a case Connecticut had no jurisdiction 27 over the marriage status so as to affect the status of a New York resident. New York could recognize the 28 Connecticut decree, but it could not be compelled to do so under the full faith and credit clause. The res ult of 29 this decision has been to create a hopeless conflict of authority as to the status of a foreign divorce rendered 30 against a nondomiciled defendant on constructive service. Some courts refuse to recognize foreign decrees so 31 rendered as against their own residents. It should be noted that Pennsylvania, the state rendering the decree 32 involved in the instant case, is a state which refuses to grant any efficacy to a foreign decree secured on 33 constructive service against one of its own citizens, at least wh ere Pennsylvania is the matrimonial domicile. 34 Colvin v. Reed, 55 Pa. 375; Duncan v. Duncan, 265 Pa. 464, 109 A. 220. Other states recognize such decrees to 35 their full extent, permitting them to be attacked solely on jurisdictional*34 grounds. Among this latter group of 36 states there is hopeless conflict of authority as to what constitutes a jurisdictional defect which can be 37 collaterally attacked in a sister state. See 39 A. L. R. 603 AND 42 A. L. R. 1405, notes where the cases are 38 exhaustively collected and commented upon. 39 [Delanoy v.

This 1 section will give you some suggestions. The U.S. Supreme Court h elped clarify how to meet the burden of proving that 2 you aren’t a “public officer” or a “straw man” when it held the following: 3 “One great object of the Constitution is to permit citizens to structure their private relations as they choose 4 subject only to the constraints of statutory or decisional law . [500 U.S. 614, 620] 5 To implement these principles, courts must consider from time to time where the governmental sphere [e.g. 6 “public purpose” and “public office”] ends and the private sphere begins. Altho ugh the conduct of private 7 parties lies beyond the Constitution's scope in most instances, governmental authority may dominate an 8 activity to such an extent that its participants must be deemed to act with the authority of the government 9 and, as a result, be subject to constitutional constraints. This is the jurisprudence of state action, which 10 explores the \"essential dichotomy\" between the private sphere and the public sphere, with all its attendant 11 constitutional obligations. Moose Lodge, supra, at 172. “ 12 [. . .] 13 Given that the statutory authorization for the challenges exercised in this case is clear, the remainder of our 14 state action analysis centers around the second part of the Lugar test, whether a private litigant, in all fairness, 15 must be deemed a g overnment actor in the use of peremptory challenges. Although we have recognized that this 16 aspect of the analysis is often a fact- bound inquiry, see Lugar, supra, 457 U.S. at 939, our cases disclose 17 certain principles of general application. Our precedents establish that, in determining whether a particular 18 action or course of conduct is governmental in character, it is relevant to examine the following: 19 [1] the extent to which the actor relies on governmental assistance and benefits, see Tulsa Professiona l 20 Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) ; Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 21 715 (1961) ; 22 [2] whether the actor is performing a traditional governmental function, see Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 23 (1953) ; Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946) ; cf. San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States 24 Olympic [500 U.S. 614, 622] Co mmittee, 483 U.S. 522, 544 - 545 (1987) ; 25 [3] and whether the injury caused is aggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority, 26 see Shelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1 (1948) . 27 Based on our application of these t hree principles to the circumstances here, we hold that the exercise of 28 peremptory challenges by the defendant in the District Court was pursuant to a course of state action. 29 [Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company, 500 U.S. 614 (1991) ] 30 Based on the above, you are representing the government as a public officer or employee if: 31 1. You are relying on governmental assistance and benefits. See Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 32 U.S. 478 (1988) ; Burton v. Wilmington Parking Autho rity, 365 U.S. 715 (1961) . Examples: 33 1.1. Social security. 34 1.2. Medicare. 35 1.3. Unemployment insurance. 36 2. You are performing a traditional governmental function, see Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953) ; Marsh v. Alabama, 37 326 U.S. 501 (1946 ); cf. San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic [500 U.S. 614, 622] 38 Committee, 483 U.S. 522, 544 -545 (1987) ; 39 3. You caused someone an injury that was aggravated by the fact that you were exercising governmental authority. S ee 40 Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948) . For instance: 41 3.1. You were acting as a “withholding agent” as defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(16) and you did it improperly or 42 unlawfully, you are presumed to be a “public officer” in the government. 43 3.2. You were acting as a “taxpayer” as defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(14) and submitted a “taxpayer” form to the 44 government, and the form contained falsehoods, then y ou are presumed to be a government actor.

Insist that it is a crime to impersonate a public officer in criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. §912 and that it would be a 23 crime to even participate in any tax proceeding as a “taxpayer” because of this. The reasons include: 24 14.1. 4 U.S.C. §72 says all public offices MUST be exercised ONL Y in the District of Columbia. 25 14.2. There is no definition of “State” or “United States” within the I.R.C. that expressly includes any state of the 26 Union. Therefore, they are purposefully excluded by implication: 27 “Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

Wh en certain 30 persons or things are specified in a law, contract, or will, an intention to exclude all others from its operation 31 may be inferred. Under this maxim, if statute specifies one exception to a general rule or assumes to specify 32 the effects of a certain provision, other exceptions or effects are excluded.” 33 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p . 581 ] 34 __________________________________ ______________________________________________ 35 \" When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition, even if it varies from that 36 term's ordinary meaning.

You are engaged in federal franchises and therefore acting in the capacity of the “Public Officer” mentioned in 16 F.R.Civ.P. 17(d) . 17 2. You are a “public offic er” within the government. 18 3. You are partaking of a “public right” and statutory “privilege”. 19 4. You are not protected by the constitution, but only have such “public rights” as Congress confers by statute. 20 5. You consented to participate in the franchise because you didn’t indicate duress or rebut the evidence connecting you 21 to the franchise. 22 If you would like more resources on how to litigate successfully as a sovereign, a non- citizen national, and a “transient 23 foreigner” who does not participate in government fr anchises, see: 24 Civil Court Remedies for Sovereigns: Taxation , Litigation Tool #10.002 http://sedm.org/Litigation/LitIndex.htm 11.5 Effect of representing the “straw man” on your standing 25 The most important affect of partaking in a franchise or public right upon your standing in federal court is that you are 26 effectively signing a blank check because: 27 1. The government grantor of the franchise can change the terms of the franchise agreement at any time without notice to 28 you. 29 2. The franchise agreement often determines choice of law and frequently even dictates the forum in which disputes must 30 be litigated. The I.R.C.

But you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred 31 pillars, and cut down their wooden images (for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name 32 is Jealous, is a jealous God), lest you make a covenant [engage in a franchise, contract, or agreement] with 33 the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot with their gods [pagan governme nt judges and rulers] 34 and make sacrifice [YOU and your RIGHTS!] to their gods, and one of them invites you and you eat of his 35 sacrifice, and you take of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters play the harlot with their gods and 36 make your sons play the harlot with their gods. “ 37 [Exodus 34:10- 16, Bible, NKJV] 38 The “gods” referred to above are the “parens patriae” that you nominate to be your ruler whenever you sign up for a 39 franchise or government “ benefit” . 40 “The more you want [privileges], the more the world can hurt you.” 41 [Confucius ] 42 “The proposition is that the United States, as the grantor of the franchises of the company, the author of its 43 charter, and the donor of lands, rights, and privileges of immense value, and as parens patriae, is a trustee, 44 invested with power to enforce the proper use of the property and franchises granted for the benefit of the 45 public.” 46 [U.S. v.

Law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice. Due process of law 19 in each particular case means such an exercise of the powers of the government as the settled maxims of law 20 permit and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims 21 prescribe for the class of cases to which the one in question belongs. A course of legal proceedings accordi ng 22 to those rules and principles which have been established in our systems of jurisprudence for the enforcement 23 and protection of private rights. To give such proceedings any validity, there must be a tribunal competent by 24 its constitution —that is, by th e law of the creation —to pass upon the subject -matter of the suit; and, if that 25 involves merely a determination of the personal liability of the defendant, he must be brought within its 26 jurisdiction by service of process within the state, or his voluntary appearance . Pennoyer v. Neff, 96 U.S. 733, 27 24 L.Ed. 565. Due process of law implies the right of the person affected thereby to be present befor e the 28 tribunal which pronounces judgment upon the question of life, liberty, or property, in its most comprehensive 29 sense; to be heard, by testimony or otherwise, and to have the right of controverting, by proof, every material 30 fact which bears on the ques tion of right in the matter involved. If any question of fact or liability be 31 conclusively be presumed [rather than proven] against him, this is not due process of law. 32 An orderly proceeding wherein a person with notice, actual or constructive, and has an opportunity to be heard 33 and to enforce and protect his rights before a court having the power to hear and determine the case. 34 Kazubowski v. Kazubowski, 45 Ill.2d 405, 259 N.E.2d 282, 290. Phrase means that no person shall be deprived 35 of life, liberty, property or of any right granted him by statute, unless matter involved first shall have been 36 adjudicated against him upon trial conducted according to established rules regulating judicial proceedings, 37 and it forbids condemnation without a hearing. Pettit v. Penn, LaApp., 180 So.2d 66, 69. The concept of “due 38 process of law” as it is embodied in the Fifth Amendment demands that a law shall not be unreasonable, 39 arbitrary, or capricious and that the means selected shall have a reasonable and substantial relation to t he 40 object being sought. U.S. v. Smith, D.C.Iowa, 249 F.Supp. 515, 516. Fundamental requisite of “due process of 41 law” is the opportunity to be heard, to be aware that a matter is pending, to make an informed choice whether 42 to acquiesce or contest, and to assert before the appropriate decision -making body the reasons for such choice. 43 Trinity Episcopal Corp. v. Romney, D.C.N.Y., 387 F.Supp. 1044, 1084. Aside from all else, “due process” 44 means fundamental fairness and substantial justice. Vau ghn v. State, 3 Tenn.Crim.App. 54, 456 S.W.2d 879, 45 883. 46 Embodied in the due process concept are the basic rights of a d efendant in criminal proceedings and the 47 requisites for a fair trial. These rights and requirements have been expanded by Supreme Court decisions and 48 include, timely notice of a hearing or trial which informs the accused of the charges against him or her; the 49 opportunity to confront accusers and to present evidence on one’s own behalf before an impartial jury or judge; 50 the presumption of innocence under which guilt must be proven by legally obtained evidence and the verdict 51 must be supported by the evidence presented; rights at the earliest stage of the criminal process; and the 52 guarantee that an individual will not be tried more than once for the same offence (double jeopardy). 53 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 500 ] 54 As indicated above, the purpose of due process of law is: 55 1.

To prevent litigants before a court of being deprived of their property by the court or their opponent without just 12 compensation. In law, all rights are property and any deprivation of rights without consideration is a deprivation of 13 property in violation of the Fifth Amendment takings clause. Those who violate due process essentially are 14 STEALIN G from their opponent. 15 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' 16 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these rights, governments are instituted. That property [or income] which a 17 man h as honestly acquired he retains full control of, subject to these limitations: First, that he shall not use 18 it to his neighbor's injury, and that does not mean that he must use it for his 19 neighbor's benefit [e.g. SOCIAL SECURITY, Medicare, and every other 20 public “benefit”]; second, that if he devotes it to a public use, he gives to the public a right to 21 control that use; and third, that whenever the public needs require, the public may take it upon payment of 22 due compensation .” 23 [Budd v. People of State of N ew York, 143 U.S. 517 (1892) ] 24 4. Prevent presumptions, and especially conclusive presumptions, that may injure the rights of the litigants by insisting 25 that only physical evidence with foundational testimony may form the basis for any inferences by the court or the jury. 26 “If a ny question of fact or liability be conclusively be presumed [rather than proven] against him, this is not 27 due process of law. ” 28 [Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 500 ] 29 __________________________________________________________________________________ 30 (1) [8:4993] Conclusive presumptions affecting protected interests: 31 A conclusive presumption may be defeated where its application would impair a party's constitutionally- 32 protected liberty or property interests.

The clause in question means, therefore, that there can be no 13 proceeding against life, liberty, or property which may result in deprivation of either, without the observance of 14 those general rules established in our system of jurisprudence for the security of private rights.\" 15 Under the Fourth Amendment, the legislature is bound to provide a method for the assessment and collection of 16 taxes that shall not be inconsistent with natural justice; but it is not bound to provide that the particular steps of 17 a procedure for the collection of such taxes shall be proved by written evidence; and it may properly impose 18 upon the taxpayer the burden of showing that in a particular case the statutory method was not observed.\" 19 [Turpin v.

All that federal prosecutor s and judges prove by parading “men” in front of the jury instead of reading the law 31 itself is that they want to destroy the very foundation of our rights and liberty in this country, which is the rule of 32 law, and replace it with an imperial judicial monar chy of men. The result is that they turn our country into what 33 God calls “an abomination”. 34 “One who turns his ear from hearing the law [ God's law or man's law ], even his prayer is an abomination.” 35 [ Prov. 28:9 , Bible, NKJV] 36 \"But this crowd that does not know [and quote and follow and use] the law is accursed.” 37 [ John 7:49 , Bible, NKJV] 38 \"Salvation is far from the wicked, For they do not seek Your [God's] statutes.\" 39 [ Psalms 119:155 , Bible, NKJV] 40 3.2. No am ount of grandstanding and salesmanship by an “expert” can add ANYTHING to the definitions clearly 41 appearing in the statutes. The courts cannot WRITE law, which means that they can’t ADD to what appears in 42 the law in order to enlarge their jurisdiction. I t is a violation of the separation of powers for a court to write or 43 rewrite law. The making of law is a political question and courts may not lawfully entertain political questions. 44 Bringing experts in to write or rewrite or extend the law simply turns the court into a perpetual constitutional 45 convention or legislative body that subjectively decides what THEY and not the Sovereign People want. Below 46 is what the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on this important question: 47 But, fortunately for our freedom from p olitical excitements in judicial duties, this court can never with 48 propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political. The adjustment of these 49 questions belongs to the people and their political representatives, either in the State or general government. 50 These questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles.

There being so different tastes as well as opinions in 1 politics, and especially in forming constitutions, some people prefer foreign models, some domestic, and some 2 neither, while judges, on the contrary, for th eir guides, have fixed constitutions and laws, given to them by 3 others and not provided by themselves. And those others are no more Locke than an Abbe Sieyes, but the 4 people. Judges, for constitutions, must go to the people of their own country, and must [ 48 U.S. 52] merely 5 enforce such as the people themselves, whose judicial servants they are, have been pleased to put into 6 operation. 7 Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament 8 of judges wo uld be that, in such an event, all political privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the 9 people, depend on our decision finally. We would possess the power to decide against, as well as for, them, 10 and, under a prejudiced or arbitrary judiciary, the public liberties and popular privileges might thus be much 11 perverted, if not entirely prostrated. But, allowing the people to make constitutions and unmake them, allowing 12 their representatives to make laws and unmake them, and without our interference as to their principles or 13 policy in doing it, yet, when constitutions and laws are made and put in force by others, then the courts, as 14 empowered by the State or the Union, commence their functions and may decide on the rights which conflicting 15 parties can legally set up under them, rather than about their formation itself. Our power begins after theirs 16 ends. Constitutions and laws precede the judiciary, and we act only under and after them, and as to disputed 17 rights beneath them, rather than disputed points in making them. We speak what is the law, jus dicere, we 18 speak or construe what is the constitution, after both are made, but we make, or revise, or control neither. 19 The disputed rights beneath constitutions already made are to be governed by precedents, by sound legal 20 principles, by positive legislation, clear contracts, moral duties, and fixed rules; they are per se questions of 21 law, and are well suited to the education and habits of the bench. But the other disputed points in making 22 constitutions, dependi ng often, as before shown, on policy, inclination, popular resolves and popular will and 23 arising not in respect to private rights, not what is meum and tuum, but in relation to politics, they belong to 24 politics, and they are settled by political tribunals, and are too dear to a people bred in the school of Sydney 25 and Russel for them ever to intrust their final decision, when disputed, to a class of men who are so far removed 26 from them as the judiciary, a class also who might decide them erroneously, as well as right, and if in the 27 former way, the consequences might not be able to be averted except by a revolution, while a wrong decision 28 by a political forum can often be peacefully corrected by new elections or instructions in a single month; and 29 if the people, in the distribution of powers under the constitution, should ever think of making judges 30 supreme arbiters in political controversies when not selected by nor, frequently, amenable to them nor at 31 liberty to follow such various considerations in their jud gments as [48 U.S. 53] belong to mere political 32 questions, they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in this 33 way -- slowly, but surely -- a new sovereign power in the republic, in most respects irresponsible and 34 unchangeable for life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the worst elective oligarchy in the 35 worst of times. Again, instead of controlling the people in political affairs, the judiciary in our system was 36 designed rather to control individuals, on the one hand, when encroaching, or to defend them, on the other, 37 under the Constitution and the laws, when they are encroached upon. And if the judiciary at times seems to 38 fill the important station of a check in the government, it is rather a check on the legislature, who may attempt 39 to pass laws contrary to the Constitution, or on the executive, who may violate both the laws and Constitution, 40 than on the people themselves in their primary capacity as makers and amenders of constitutions. 41 [Luther v.

The straw man is a public officer in the government. 5 2. The method of con necting one’s private property to the “straw man” is by using the license number assigned to the 6 office, which is the Taxpayer Identification Number. 7 The measure of whether the all caps name means anything is whether the courts treat it as a criteria in a dispute. No one 8 has ever shown us any proof that use of an all caps name in association with a natural being was a legitimate basis to 9 determine whether the accused was engaged in a federal franchise or was engaged in the “trade or business” franchise. 10 Until we see evidence that courts or government prosecutors actually make the all caps name into a criteria for convicting 11 someone, using this argument is going to do nothing but make those who use it look STUPID in front of both a judge and a 12 jury. 13 A bette r way to attack the straw man is simply to claim that any identifying number associat ed with you by the government : 14 1. Is n ot “yours ”. 20 CFR §422.103(d) says it belongs to the government and not any private person. It is illeg al and 15 constitutes theft and embezzlement to use public property for a private use and you therefore can’t associate such 16 public property with your private property without donating your private property to a public use to procure the 17 benefits of a governm ent franchise. The only one who can perform that donation is you WITH your informed consent. 18 “Men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, -'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' 19 and to 'secure,' not grant or create, these ri ghts, governments are instituted.

Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be 10 justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. ” 11 [Romans 3:19- 20, Bible, NKJV] 12 “Therefore, my b rethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be 13 married to another —to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God. ” 14 [Romans 7:4, Bible, NKJV] 15 Someone who is “under the [civil] law” in our country is someone who voluntarily consents to be subject to it by choosing 16 a domicile within the place protected by that law and thereby becoming a “citizen”, “resident”, or “inhabitant”. This is the 17 whole notion behind the Declaration of independence: Consent of the governed, or should we say consent TO BE 18 governed: 19 “The citizen cannot complain, because he has 20 voluntarily submitted himself to such a form of 21 government. He owes allegiance to the two departments, so to speak, and within their respective 22 spheres must pay the penalties which each exacts for disobedience to its laws. In return, he can demand 23 protection from each within its own jurisdiction. ” 24 [United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875) [emphasis added] 25 You cannot complain about the c ivil laws of a place based on the above, because you wouldn’t be called a “citizen” in that 26 place unless you have voluntarily chosen a domicile there and thereby: 27 1. Consented to be “governed”, as the Declaration of Independence indicates. In legal terms, this choice is called 28 “animus manendi”. 29 2.

Since the 33 Fourteenth Amendment makes one a citizen of the state wherein he resides, the fact of residence creates 34 universally reciprocal duties of protection by the state and of allegiance and support by the citizen. The latter 35 obviously includes a duty to pay taxes, and their nature and measure is largely a political matter.

This is a logical deduction from the postulate that\" every person must have a domicil somewhere.\" 29 For as a new domicil cannot be acquired except by actual residence cum animo manendi, it follows that the 30 domicil of origin [Heaven] adheres while the subject of it is in transitu, or, if he has not yet determined upon 31 a new place of abode, while he is in search of one, --\"quarens quo se conferat atque ubi constituat. \" Although 32 this is a depar ture from the Roman law doctrine, yet it is held with entire unanimity by the British and American 33 cases.

Aikman : \"Every man's domicil of origin must be presumed to continue 38 until he has acquired another sole domicil by actual residence with the intention of abandoning his domicil of 39 origin. This change must be animo et facto, and the burden of proof unquestionably lies upon him who asserts 40 the change.\" Lord Cranworth observed in the same case: \"It is a clear principle of law that the domicil of origin 41 continues until another is acquired ; i.e., until the person has made a new home for himself in lieu of the home of 42 his birth.\" In America similar language has been used. 43 [Treatise on the Law of Domicil ; M.W.Jacobs, 1887, pp. 174- 175; Little, Brown, and Company; 44 SOURCE: http://books.google.com/books?id=MFQvAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage ] 45 3.

Insists that the government meet the burden of proving that it is providing REAL consideration whenever they 28 want to impose the duties of the franchise agreement. That consideration MUST not result in any surrender of 29 any constitutional right and must be legally enforceable in a real, constitutional court and not an Article IV 30 administrative franchise court.

They are 35 also called “public rights” by the courts. 36 6.2. Constitutional rights attach to the land whereas civil rights attach to your choic e of domicile and the private law 37 contracts that implement the franchise. 38 “It is locality that is determinative of the application of the Constitution, in such matters as judicial procedure, 39 and not the status [e.g. contracts and franchises consented to] of the people who live in it. ” 40 [Balzac v.

They are all franchises, and all franchises are contracts between the grantor and the grantee. 5 As a rule, franchises spring from contracts between the sovereign power and private citizens , made upon 6 valuable considerations, for purposes of individual advantage as well as public benefit, 72 and thus a franchise 7 partakes of a double nature and character. So far as it affects or concerns the public, it is publici juris and is 8 subject to governmental control. The legislature may prescribe the manner of granting it, to whom it may be 9 granted, the conditions and terms upon which it may be held, and the duty of the grantee to the public in 10 exercising it, and may also provide for its forfeiture upon the failure of the grantee to perform that duty. But 11 when granted, it becomes the property of the grantee, and is a private right, subject only to the governmental 12 control growing out of its other nature as publici juris. 73 13 [Am.Jur.2d, Franchises, §4: Generally ] 14 Why must they be contracts? Because a property interest cannot be conveyed without written consent in some form. 15 Franchise courts such as Tax Court can only hear cases where the government has a property interest that is provable 16 using evidence. 17 2. To be a contract, they must impose a mutual contractual obligation upon both parties that is legally enforceable under 18 the terms of the franchise agreement. 19 CONTRACT. A promissory agreement between two or more persons that creates, modifies, or destroys a legal 20 relation. Buffalo Pres sed Steel Co. v.

Each party must have the capacity, delegated authority, and standing to enter into the contract as a matter of law. 38 4.

Like other voidable contracts, it is valid until it is avoided by the person entitled to 4 avoid it. 76 However, duress in the form of physical compulsion, in which a party is caused to appear to assent 5 when he has no intention of doing so, is generally deemed to render the resulting purported contract void. 77 ” 6 [American Jurisprudence 2d, Duress, Section 21 ] 7 To invalidate the enforcement of a franchise against a party then, we must demonstrate one or more elements: 8 1.

Indicates that you lawfully terminated participation in all franchises. 25 1.1. Section 4.3 perpetually abandons all employment, agency, or office in the government. Therefore, it is 26 impossible to consensually or lawfully participate in the a “trade or business” or public office in the government. 27 1.2. Section 8.5, item 7.4 indicates that you resigned from Social Security and that any numbers associated with you 28 are not those defined at 20 CFR §422.103(d) . 29 2. Removes the possibility that you could receive consideration or “benefit” in connection with any franchise. 30 2.1. Section 4.4 indicates that the government MAY NOT provide and that you do not consent to receive any 31 “benefit” or consideration in connection with any franchi se and that if the government violates this positive 32 command, such act shall be construed not as “consideration”, but rather a “gift” for which no compensation is 33 due, slavery, and a compelled bribe. 34 2.2. Section 8.6.1.2 defines “benefit” for the purposes of al l franchises in such a way that it is impossible to construe 35 anything the government provides as a “benefit” which therefore confers any reciprocal obligation whatsoever. 36 3.

The Resignat ion of Compelled Social Security Trustee form also says that if they want to hire you as the person 25 responsible for the liabilities associated with this government property, then the compensation you demand is all the tax and 26 penalty liability therein asso ciated plus $1,000 per hour above and beyond that for your services as a “public officer”. 27 Remember, anyone who wants you to take custody of and responsibility for government property is making an offer of 28 employment to you.

It 14 proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that all such rhe toric is not only FALSE, FRAUDULENT, and RIDICULOUS, but 15 constitutes a criminal conspiracy against your constitutionally guaranteed rights. You have a constitutionally protected 16 right to NOT contract with or do business with the government protected by Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution. The 17 government is just like any other corporation or business and the onl y service it provides is \"protection\". Those who are 18 \"customers\" of this protection and social insurance service must voluntarily choose a domicile within the jurisdiction of the 19 government and are then called statutory \"U.S. citizens \", \" U.S. residents \", or \" U.S. persons \". When the \"protection service\" 20 provided by government is ineffective, wasteful, inefficient, and/or actually harmful to us or o ur family, we always have the 21 right to \"fire the bastards\" and cease to be \"customers\".

What people call the “straw man” is real. It is recognized in the legal dicti onary, in fact. 28 2. Three requirements must be met in order for a “straw man” to lawfully exist: 29 2.1. A commercial transaction involving real or personal property. 30 2.2. Agency of one or more persons on behalf of an artificial entity who accomplish the commercial transac tion. 31 2.3. Property being acquired by a party that otherwise is not allowed or not lawful. 32 3. The government had to create the straw man because without it, nearly everyone would be entirely beyond their reach 33 as a private person and a sover eign. The ability to r egulate private conduct, in fact, is “repugnant to the constitution”, 34"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 162 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ according to the U.S. Supreme Court. City of Boerne v. Florez, Archbishop of San Antonio, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) . The 1 straw man makes it possible for the government to regulate private conduct indirectly , rather than directly, using the 2 office that the gov ernment created and which you consented to occupy by applying for government franchises and 3 benefits and thereby exercising your right to contract. The government can only tax that which it created. Since it 4 didn’t create the natural being, then it had to create something else and fool you into believing that you are that person 5 using “words of art”, smoke, and mirrors. 6 “The power to tax involves the power to destroy; the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power 7 to create; and there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government [THE FEDERAL 8 GOVERNMENT] a power to control the constitutional measures of another [WE THE PEOPLE], which 9 other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control. \" 10 [Van Brocklin v. State of Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151 (1886) ] 11 “What is a Constitu tion? It is the form of government, delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in which 12 certain first principles of fundamental laws are established. The Constitution is certain and fixed; it contains 13 the permanent will of the people, and is the supreme law of the land; it is paramount to the power of the 14 Legislature, and can be revoked or altered only by the authority that made it. The life- giving principle [act of 15 creation] and the death- doing stroke [power to destroy] must proceed from the same hand. ” 16 [VanHorne’s Lessee v. Dorrance, 2 U.S. 304 (1795) ] 17 “ The great principle is this: because the constitution will not permit a state to destroy, it will not permit a law 18 [including a tax law] involving the power to destroy. ” 19 [Providence Bank v. Billings, 29 U.S. 514 (1830) ] 20 4. In law, all rights are “property”. The purpose of creating the straw man is to allow the government to acquire rights to 21 property without compensating the human beings it acquire s them from. Without the straw man, this acquisition of 22 property would be unlawful but with the straw man, it is not unlawful. There are four main “rights” or types of 23 property that the government acquires by creating the straw man that they cannot other wise lawfully possess in the 24 context of private persons: 25 4.1. They cannot lawfully impose duties or obligations upon human beings without compensation. This is a violation 26 of the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition against involunt ary servitude. This prohibition, unlike the Bill of 27 Rights, applies everywhere, including on federal territory. 28 4.2. They cannot lawfully abuse their power to tax to pay public monies to private persons. 29 4.3. They cannot lawfully maintain records about private pers ons without their consent. 30 4.4. They cannot lawfully use, benefit from, or tax your private property without your consent, whether express or 31 implied . 32 5. The “straw man” in all the contexts we have been able to identify is simply: 33 5.1. A “public officer” or agent withi n the government. 34 5.2. An artificia l entity that is usually the subject of a trust . That trust is usually an extension of the “public trust”, 35 meaning the government. The trust document is the Constitution. 36 \"Whatever these Constitutions and laws validly determine to be property, it is the duty of the Federal 37 Government, through the domain of jurisdiction merely Federal, to recognize to be property. 38 And this principle follows from the structure of the respective Governments, State and Federal, and their 39 reciprocal relations. They are different agents and trustees of the people of the several States, appointed with 40 different powers and with distinct purposes, but whose acts, within the scope of their respective jurisdictions, 41 are mutually obligatory. \" 42 [Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856) ] 43 6. The straw man is a creation of the government. 44 6.1. The straw man is therefore “property” of the government . The essenc e of ownership over “property” is the 45 protected right to exclude its use by others and to deprive others of any of the “benefits” arising from its use. 46 6.2. Only those expressly authorized by the government can therefore lawfully “benefit” commercially from the 47 government’s creation and property. That authorization must be found somewhere within the franchise 48 agreement that created the straw man. 49 6.3. You as a private human being cannot therefore lawfully take control of or benefit from the straw man without 50 becomin g a trustee and public officer of the government operating under the terms of the franchise agreement that 51 created the straw man and regulates its activities. Within I.R.C. Subtitle A, for instance, the “straw man” is a 52 franchisee called a “taxpayer” as d efined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(14) . 53"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" Proof that There Is a “Straw man” 163 of 184 Copyright Sovereignty Education and Defense Ministry , http://sedm.org Form 05.042, Rev. 12- 26- 200 8 EXHIBIT:________ 6.4. If you try to commercially benefit from the straw man without accepting the associated liabilities and the public 1 office that goes with it, then you are st ealing property from the government and you will lose in court every time 2 and deserve to lose. This idea is the reason why so many people lose in court who try to cancel debts , transfer 3 liabilities of the straw man to others , or file bills of exchange lie ning the straw man in satisfaction of tax debts . 4 All such activities amount essentially to stealing property from the government. 5 6.5. Income taxes essentially amount to the “rent” you pay for the privilege of availing yourself of the benefits of the 6 franchise associated with the straw man such as: 7 6.5.1. Unemployment insurance. 8 6.5.2. Medicare benefits. 9 6.5.3. Social security benefits. 10 6.5.4. A fiat currency system that makes it easy to borrow. 11 7. If you want to identify who the “straw man” is in the law, start with the definitions for the following terms: 12 7.1. “person”. See, for instance, 26 U.S.C. §6671(b) and 26 U.S.C. §7343 , all of whom are officers or employees of 13 federal corporations and not natural beings. 14 7.2. “individual”. See 26 CFR §1.1441 -1(c )(3) , which is defined as an alien or nonresident alien who is then defined 15 in 26 CFR §1.1- 1(a)(2)(ii) as being engaged in the “trade or business” franchise. 16 7.3. “taxpayer”. See 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(14) and 26 U.S.C. §1313 . This is a “person” engaged in the “trade or 17 business” franchise and therefore a “public office” within the U.S. government. 18 7.4. “citizen”. See 26 CFR §1.1- 1(c ). Defined as an artificial entity with a domicile in the District of Columbia (see 19 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) ) and no part of any state of the Union. 20 7.5. “resident”. See 26 U.S .C. §7701(b)(1)(A). Defined as an artific ial entity that is an alien with a domicile in the 21 District of Columbia (see 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(9) and (a)(10) ) and no part of any state of the Union. 22 7.6. “employee”. See 5 U.S.C. §2105 , 26 U.S.C. §3401(c ) , and 26 CFR §31.3401(c ) -1. 23 7.7. “U.S. person” as defined in 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(30) , where the “U.S.” they mean is the government and not any 24 geographical place. 25 7.8. “trade or business”. 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26) defines this as “the functions of a public office”. Only public 26 officers can law fully exercise the functions of a public office. You have to be a public officer for the national 27 government in order for them to acquire extraterritorial jurisdiction in a foreign state, which is what the states of 28 the Union are in relation to the nation al government under the Constitution. 29 “ The United States government is a foreign corporation with respect to a state. \" 30 [19 Corpus Juris Secundum, Corporations, §883 ] 31 8. The usual method for creating the “straw man” is the exercise of your right to contract by applying for and accepting 32 government franchises and other so -calle d “benefits” . In other words, the exercise of your right to contract creates the 33 artificial “person” or “public office” or “res” that i s the only lawful subject of nearly all government legislation. For 34 details on how these franchises operate, see: 35 Gover nment Instituted Slavery Using Franchises , Form #05.030 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 9. All government franchises: 36 9.1. Are “Proper ty” within the meaning of Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 of the United States government. 37 9.2. Are implemented as contracts and must meet all the same criteria as contracts in or der to be enforceable . 38 As a rule, franchises spring from contracts between the sovereign power and private citizens , made upon 39 valuable considerations, for purposes of individual advantage as well as public benefit, 78 and thus a franchise 40 partakes of a double nature and character. So far as it affects or concerns the public, it is publici juris and is 41 subject to governmental control. The legislature may prescribe the manner of granting it, to whom it may be 42 granted, the conditions and terms upon which it may be held, and the duty of the grantee to the public in 43 exercising it, and may also provide for its forfeiture upon the failure of the grantee to perform that duty. But 44 when granted, it becomes the property of the grantee, and is a private right, subject only to the governmental 45 control growing out of its other nature as publici juris. 79 46 [Am.Jur.2d, Franchises, §4: Generally ] 47   78 Georgia R. & Power Co. v.

Federal franchises may only lawfully be created or enforced on fe deral territory and not within any state of the Union. 3 “Thus, Congress having power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and 4 with the Indian tribes, may, without doubt, provide for granting coasting licenses , licenses to pilots, licenses to 5 trade with the Indians, and any other licenses necessary or proper for the exercise of that great and extensive 6 power; and the same observation is applicable to every other power of Congress, to the exercise of which the 7 granting of licenses may be incident. All such licenses confer authority, and give rights to the licensee. 8 But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States . Over this 9 commerce and trade Congress has no power of regulatio n nor any direct control. This power belongs 10 exclusively to the States. No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted within a State 11 is warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental to the exercise of powers clearly granted 12 to the legislature . The power to authorize a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the exclusive power 13 of the State over the same subject. It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very extensive power. It is 14 given in the Co nstitution, with only one exception and only two qualifications. Congress cannot tax exports, and 15 it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule of uniformity. Thus 16 limited, and thus only, it reaches every subject, and may be exercised at discretion. But, it reaches only existing 17 subjects. Congress cannot authorize a trade or business within a State in order to tax it. ” 18 [License Tax Cases, 72 U.S. 462 , 18 L.Ed. 497, 5 Wall. 462, 2 A.F.T.R. 2224 (1866) ] 19 The reason for the above is because the rights of persons protected by the U.S. Constitution within states of the Union 20 are “unalienable”, according to the Declaration of Independence. “ Inalie nable” means they cannot be bargained away 21 or sold through any commercial process. Since franchises are a commercial process, they cannot lawfully be offered 22 on land protected by the Constitution and therefore may only be offered to persons domiciled on f ederal territory. 23 “We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator 24 with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That to 25 secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the 26 governed, -“ 27 [Declaration of Independence ] 28 “Unalienable.

Holding a “public office” in the District of Columbia corporation/government. 33 14.2. Domiciled on federal territory and therefore a statutory “U.S. citizen” pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1401 or statutory 34 “U.S. resident” (alien) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(3) . 35 14.3.

Judges officiating over franchises are acting in an administrative capacity under Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 of 5 the Constitution rather than in an Article III constitutional capacity. For instance, the United States Tax Court is a 6 legislative franchise court in the Executive rather than judicial branch of the government. It is established 7 pursuant to Article I of the United States Constitution as described in 26 U.S.C. §7441 . 8 15.5. All federal district and circuit courts are Article 4, Section 3, Clause 2 “property courts”, which are also called 9 “franchise courts”.

N either Congress nor any judge may lawfully compel you to accept the duties of a franchisee and use a franchise 15 court without your consent.

They are required to produce written evidence of consent to participate IN WRITING, not unlike how t hey 19 require you to prove a waiver of sovereign immunity using a statute if you want to sue them. 20 17.2. They are implement ed using voluntary licenses. 21 17.3. They are not enforced outside of federal territory. 22 17.4. They are not used to undermine the constitutional rights of those not domiciled on federal territory and who are 23 therefore protected by the Constitution. 24 17.5. The government enforces your equal right to engage them in franchises of your own creation using the same 25 mechanisms by which they trap you in their franchises. For instance, if third parties are allowed to volunteer you 26 into the “trade or business” franchise simply by filing an unsigned information return, then you have an equal 27 right to obligate the government to become obligated by similar third party reports under the terms of your own 28 franchise. If they won’t enforce the same rights on your part that they have in this regard, they are violating the 29 requirement for equal protection that is the foundation of the Constitution.

It is not open to doubt that Congress may enforce the 1 Thirteenth Amendment by direct legislation, punishing the holding of a person in slavery or in involuntary 2 servitude except as a punishment for a crime. In the exercise of that power Congress has enacted these sections 3 denouncing peonage, and punishing one who holds another in that condition of involuntary servitude. This 4 legislation is not limited to the territories or other parts of the strictly national domain, but is operative in the 5 states and wherever the sovereignty of the United States extends. We entertain no doubt of the validity of this 6 legislation, or of its applicability to the case of any person holding another in a state of peonage, and this 7 whether there be municipal ordinance or state law sanctioning such holding.

The usual method of attaching property to the franchise under the I.R.C., for instance, is to avail yourself of any of the 18 following commercial “benefits” found within the I.R.C. in the context of specific property that i s in your name: 19 20.1. A reduced, graduated rate of tax under 26 U.S.C. §1. Those who don’t take the graduated rate pay the higher flat 20 30% rate of tax paid by nonresident aliens in 26 U.S.C. §871(a) . 21 20.2.

If you want to avoid partici pation in a franchise or attack the enforceability of it against you, you must: 29 21.1. Learn EXACTLY how franchise work and all their weak points. You must understand your enemy if you want to 30 win at war. See: 31 Government Instituted Slavery Using Franchises , For m #05.030 http://sedm.org/Forms/FormIndex.htm 21.2. Identify yourself as a “nonresident”, “transient foreigner”, and “stateless person” in relation to the government 32 granting the franchise. All franchises are implemented as civil law that attaches to the jurisdiction that you claim 33 domicile within. If you don’t have a domicile within their jurisdiction because you are a “nonresi9dent”, t hen 34 they can’t enforce the franchise against you, including penalties. 35 21.3. Insist under penalty of perjury that you received no “benefits” that are enforceable as “rights” in court by virtue of 36 participation. Any contract that does not create mutually enforce able rights in a constitutional and not franchise 37 court is unenforceable. Place the burden of proof on the government to prove that you received a “benefit” and 38 that you were eligible to receive it. 39 21.4. Insist that the government is not allowed to give you any “benefits” under the franchise agreement and that if they 40 do, they are “gifts” that create no obligation. This is exactly the same thing the government does with the tax 41 system: Claim that any contributions voluntarily given are gifts that are non -refu ndable and create no obligation 42 on their part. See Treasury Decision 3445 below: 43 http://famguardian.org/TaxFreedom/CitesByTopic/voluntary.htm 44 21.5. Not use government identifying numbers in connection with your personal property. 45 21.6. Fight their franchise using an anti -franchise. Remember: The foundation of the Constitution is equal protection 46 and equal rights, which means that you can use the same devious tactics and franchises that the y do. For instance, 47 on the form that regulates the franchise, write “not valid without the attached form.” Then attach your own form 48 that establishes a franchise that invalidates theirs and makes the recipient into surety for any obligations imposed 49 upon you for your participation. Our Tax Form Attachment, Form #04.201, does that, for instance. 50 21.7.

You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. One way or another we will make you into 18 one of our officers and employees without compensation or we will destroy you through selective enforcement if 19 you refuse to cooperate. We don’t care that the First Amendment prohibits compelled association or that we 20 can’t compel you to contract with us without violating th e Constitution. We will just PR ESUME that you 21 consented to our franchise agreement, and that agreement places you squarely on federal territory in a place 22 not protected by the Constitution so just kiss your rights goodbye and bend over. 23 “Indeed, the practical interpretation put by Congress upon the Constitution has been 24 long continued and uniform to the effect [182 U.S. 244, 279] that the Constitution is 25 applicable to territories acquired by purchase or conquest, only when and so far as 26 Congress shall so d irect. Notwithstanding its duty to 'guarantee to every state in this 27 Union a republican form of government' (art. 4, 4), by which we understand, according 28 to the definition of Webster, 'a government in which the supreme power resides in the 29 whole body of t he people, and is exercised by representatives elected by them,' 30 Congress did not hesitate, in the original organization of the territories of Louisiana, 31 Florida, the Northwest Territory, and its subdivisions of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, 32 Illinois, and Wisco nsin and still more recently in the case of Alaska, to establish a form 33 of government bearing a much greater analogy to a British Crown colony than a 34 republican state of America , and to vest the legislative power either in a governor and 35 council, or a gove rnor and judges, to be appointed by the President. It was not until they 36 had attained a certain population that power was given them to organize a legislature by 37 vote of the people. In all these cases, as well as in territories subsequently organized west 38 of the Mississippi, Congress thought it necessary either to extend to Constitution and 39 laws of the United States over them, or to declare that the inhabitants should be entitled 40 to enjoy the right of trial by jury, of bail, and of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, 41 as well as other privileges of the bill of rights.” 42 [Downes v.

It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship [IRS, DOJ, and corrupted federal 30 judiciary in collusion] within a [ constitutional ] republic , demanding for itself the rights 31 and privileges [including immunity from prosecution for their wrongdoing in violation of 32 Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution ] accorded to political parties, but 33 denying to all others the lib erties [Bill of Rights] guaranteed by the Constitution. 34 Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, 35 by the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, and submit those policies and 36 programs to the electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and 37 programs of the Communist Party are secretly [ by corrupt judges and the IRS in 38 complete disregard of the tax laws ] prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the world 39 Communist movement [ the I RS and Federal Reserve] . Its members [the Congress, which 40 was terrorized to do IRS bidding recently by the framing of Congressman Traficant ] 41 have no part in determining its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party 42 objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members of the Communist Party are 43 recruited for indoctrination [in t he public schools by homosexuals, liberals, and 44 socialists] with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and 45 disciplined [by the IRS and a corrupted judiciary] to carry into action slavishly the 46 assignments given them by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political parties, the 47 Communist Party [thanks to a corrupted federal judiciary ] acknowledges no 48 constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. 49 The Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of 50 capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its 51 operation arise s not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation 52 as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present 53 constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any 54 available means, including resort to force and violence [or using income taxes]. Holding 55 that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power [the Federal Reserve and 56 the American Bar Association (ABA) ] renders its existence a clear present and 57 continuing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means whereby 58 individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movem ent [with 59 FALSE information returns] , trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in 60 the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services.

Admit that the government can only tax, regulate, and destroy that which it creates. 11 “What is a Constitution? It is the form of government, delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in which 12 certain first principles of fundamental laws are established. The Constitution is certain and fixed; it contains 13 the permanent will of the people, and is the supreme law of the land; it is paramount to the power of the 14 Legislature, and can be revoked or al tered only by the authority that made it. The life -giving principle and the 15 death- doing stroke [power to destroy] must proceed from the same hand. ” 16 [VanHorne’s Lessee v. Dorrance, 2 U.S. 304 (1795) ] 17 “ The great principle is this: because the constitution will not permit a state to destroy, it will not permit a law 18 [including a tax law] involving the power to destroy. ” 19 [Providence Bank v. Billings, 29 U.S. 514 (1830) ] 20 \"The power to tax involves the power to destroy; the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the 21 power to create; and there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government [THE FEDERAL 22 GOVERNMENT] a power to control the constitutional measures of another [WE THE PEOPLE], which 23 other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control .\" 24 [Van Brocklin v.

It is not open to doubt that Congress may enforce the 5 Thirteenth Amendment by direct legislation, punishing the holding of a person in slavery or in involuntary 6 servitude except as a punishment for a crime. In the exercise of that power Congress has enacted these sections 7 denouncing peonage, and punishing one who holds another in that condition of involuntary servitude. This 8 legislation is not limited to the territories or other parts of the strictly national domain, but is operative in the 9 states and wherever the sovereignty of the United States extends. We entertain no doubt of the validity of this 10 legislation, or of its applicability to the case of any person holding another in a state of peonage, and this 11 whether there be municipal ordinance or state law sanctioning such holding.

Slavery implies involuntary servitude— a state of 17 bondage; the ownership of mankind as a chattel, or at least the control of the labor and services of one man 18 for the benefit of another, and the absence of a legal right to the disposal of his own person, property, and 19 services [in their entirety]. This amendment was said in the Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall, 36, to have been 20 intended primarily to abolish slavery, as it had been previously known in this country, and that it equally 21 forbade Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie trade, when they amounted to slavery o r involuntary servitude 22 and that the use of the word ‘servitude’ was intended to prohibit the use of all forms of involuntary slavery, of 23 whatever class or name.” 24 [Plessy v.

All such licenses confer authority, and give rights to the licensee. 42 But very different considerations apply to the internal commerce or domestic trade of the States . Over this 43 commerce and trade Congress has no power of regulation nor any direct control . This power belongs 44 exclusively to the States. No interference by Congress with the business of citizens transacted within a State is 45 warranted by the Constitution, except such as is strictly incidental to the exercise of powers clearly granted to 46 the legislature . The power to authorize [e.g. “license”] a business within a State is plainly repugnant to the 47 exclusive power of the State over the same subject. It is true that the power of Congress to tax is a very 48 extensive power. It is given in the Constitution, with only one exception and only two qualifications. Congress 49 cannot tax exports, and it must impose direct taxes by the rule of apportionment, and indirect taxes by the rule 50 of uniformity.
