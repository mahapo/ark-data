Its name is a deliberate misnomer. Here are some Quick Facts About the “Fed”: • The “Fed” is a privately-owned banking cartel that operates outside the control of Congress and manipulates the credit of the United States for its own gain. • It is largely owned by foreign parties. • Periodic credit expansion and contraction causes the “boom” and “bust” cycles in our economy (including the current recession). • It is a system for legalized counterfeiting that allows a central bank to produce money out of thin air and “loan” it to the federal government and member banks, which the American people repay at interest. • Money creation robs Americans of savings by causing the hidden tax of “inflation”, an unnatural phenomenon of currency devaluation through dilution of the money supply. • Most personal income tax is allocated to pay interest to the banks for loaning us something that it never had in the first place. • Because money is created through loans (or the creation of debt), it is currently impossible to pay off the national debt. • The Federal Reserve System ensures that Americans remain in perpetual debt. • It enables warfare by giving Congress access to virtually unlimited funds without having to directly tax the People. • Our country’s founders were dismayed over hyperinflation at the time of the American Revolution and ensured that private central banking was made unconstitutional. • The Fed concentrates political power into the hands of a few elites and removes it from the people to whom it rightfully belongs. • The Fed has never been independently audited. “Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes its laws.” - Mayer Rothschild Philadelphia Rally to End the Fed Saturday, 4-25-2009 Think you know about the Federal Reserve System?
