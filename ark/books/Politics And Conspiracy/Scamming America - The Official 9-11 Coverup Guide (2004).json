[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL Why There Is a 9/11 Truth Movement In the third year after 9/11, the U.S. government still has not answered the most important ques- tions about what really happened. And the official 9/11 Commission has failed to ask. Fighter planes were not dispatched in a timely manner to intercept the 9/11 flights - in blatant violation of longstanding, standard operating procedures. Why? Why did the U.S. chain of command (Bush, Rumsfeld, Gen. Myers) by their own admission remain inactive during the actual attacks? On the morning of Sept. 11 itself, the U.S. military conducted scheduled wargames to rehearse scenarios that included plane hijackings and an \"errant aircraft\" crashing into a government building (AP, Aug. 2002). Even granted this was a coincidence: How can high officials like Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld get away with testifying that \"no one could have imagined\" planes would be used as weapons against buildings? Why won't the gov- ernment identify who made profits by short-selling the stock of United Airlines, American Airlines and the WTC re-insurers in the week before the attacks? Where did the many known advance warnings of the attacks originate? Were these warnings really missed? The Kean Commission (the official 9/11 investigation currently making headlines) was called to life only after Sept. 11th families lobbied stubbornly for 14 months. The same families have now demanded the resignation of the Commission's executive director, Philip Zelikow, for his evident conflicts of interest. Although Zelikow frames the Commission's agenda, he was on the Bush 2000 transition team, worked closely with Condoleeza Rice under both Bushes, and co- authored a book with Rice in 1999. Why hasn't this story made the headlines? For millions of people around the world, the timing and convenience of 9/11 gave rise to dark suspicions about the true origins of the attacks. These were fed by a level of government stonewalling that can be described only as a cover-up. The terror of September 11th, 2001 gave the holders of power in the U.S. a pretext to redefine the world - to roll back the unalienable rights of American citizens - to shift trillions from but- ter to guns - to launch a perpetual \"war on terror\" - and to go ahead with invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan that had been planned years before 2001. Now, in the third year after the crime, a 9/11 Truth movement has risen in the United States and across the globe. It aims to take the dangerous ideological weapon of 9/11 out of the hands of those who have abused it - and to open the door to the hidden truths of U.S. and world pol- itics. For too long, we have allowed the government to operate in the shadows. What has it been doing, in our name? How can you rule yourself, when you don't know where you stand? Democracy is impossible without an informed populace. The time for merely demanding disclosure about what really happened on Sept. 11, 2001 has passed. The government has refused to provide answers and engaged in a whitewash. Now it is up to the people take responsibility and face what really hap- pened on September 11, 2001. – THE EDITORS - NY 9/11 TRUTH www.ny911truth.org"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"“Scamming America” The Official 9/11 Cover-up Guide Published on the occasion of The Kean Commission Hearings at The New School University New York City, May 18-19, 2004 by NY 9/11 TRUTH T ABLE OF CONTENTS The Kean Commission and the Sept. 11 th Families .......................................2 The Rice/Zelikow Connection .......................................................................6 A brief history of the Kean Commission and its conflicts of interest The Total Failure of the Kean Commission .................................................11 Case study: How the Commission went easy on Rumsfeld, Myers and Wolfowitz Bush, Rice and the Genoa W arning .............................................................15 Documenting a demonstrable falsehood Before the Kean Commission ......................................................................17 The cover-up from 9/11 to 2003: An overview Appendix: What Do We Know About September 11 th ? ...............................19 A timeline of the defense response to 9/11 NY 9/11 Truth, Credits & Recommended Links . ................inside back cover “Bush is scamming America.” “As each day goes by, we learn that this government knew a whole lot more about these terrorists before September 11 than it has ever admitted.” “Let’s chase this rabbit into the ground here.

At the time, this was seen as a victory for the relatives of those killed on September 11th, and for their allies in the fight for open government and accountability. As the Kean Commission nears the end of its work, it is informative to ask what those fam- ilies are saying today. 23 Questions to Bush “Mr. Bush, who approved the flight of the bin Laden family out of the United States, when all commercial flights were grounded?” That is one of 23 explosive questions that George W. Bush and his subordinates must face in public testimony, under oath and pain of perjury—that is, if leaders of September 11 family groups get their way. The question refers to private flights for Saudi royalty, cleared by the White House during the otherwise total civilian flight ban in the days immediately after September 11. Members of the Bin Laden clan, including two of Osama Bin Laden’s many brothers, were allowed to leave the United States before federal investigators had a chance to question them. 1 Despite confirmed reports dating back to September 2001, the story of the Bin Laden family airlift was denigrated as urban legend until April, when former White House terror adviser Richard Clarke and Secretary of State Colin Powell both confirmed it. How many other confirmations of “urban legend” are still in store? Accountability and the Theory of Luck “Why has no one in any level of our govern- ment been held accountable for the countless failures leading up to and on 9/11?” The 23 questions are from the Family Steering Commitee, twelve September 11 rel- atives who represent many other 9/11 family groups. Since November 2002, they have monitored the 9/11 Commission headed by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean. Members of the FSC were key lobbyists in gaining an independent investigation of September 11. Mindy Kleinberg, known as one of the four “Jersey Wives,” testified to the Kean Commission during its first public proceedings in early 2003. She alerted the panel to disturbing gaps and contradictions in the government’s story of what happened on September 11. Her comments challenged the idea that all anomalies in the official story are due to incompetence or coincidence. She called that “the theory of luck.” “Is it luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored?” Kleinberg asked. She was refer- ring to the widespread reports of possible insider trading in the week before September THE 9/11 COVER-UP MAY 18, 2004 The Kean Commission and the September 11 th Families 1 Shafig bin Laden, Osama’s older brother, had been in Washington on the morning of September 11 for the annual meeting of the Carlyle Group, the fund that until that October tied Bush family interests to the Bin Laden family fortune. 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"11 indicating specific prior knowledge of the attacks. 2 Kleinberg: “Is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on incomplete forms? Is it luck when Airline Security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray? Is it luck when Emergency FA A and NORAD protocols are not fol- lowed? Is it luck when a national emergency is not reported to top government officials on a timely basis? “To me luck is something that happens once. When you have this repeated pattern of bro- ken protocols, broken laws, broken commu- nication, one cannot still call it luck. If at some point we don't look to hold the individ- uals accountable for not doing their jobs properly then how can we ever expect for ter- rorists not to get lucky again?” Since Kleinberg’s testimony the commission has avoided almost any public treatment of the issues she raised. For a transcript of Kleinberg’s comments, see www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hear- ing1/witness_kleinberg.htm A Lesson in Reading The families threw down their challenge to Bush last February, following reports that the Kean Commission had asked Bush and Bill Clinton to testify. Only in May did Bush finally appear before the panel, in a closed session at the Oval Office. No transcript was taken. Bush assented to the hearing on the condition that he testify together with Dick Cheney, who apparently did most of the talk- ing. Based on the handful of public state- ments about their joint appearance, it seems doubtful that the panel confronted Bush with this question: “Please explain why you remained at the Sarasota, Florida, Elementary School for a press conference after you had finished lis- tening to the children read, when as a terror- ist target, your presence potentially jeopard- ized the lives of the children?” Bush, his staff and his Secret Service entourage did indeed pay a visit to the Booker Elementary School, as car- ried on live tel- evision until 9:34 a.m. This was fifty minutes after the first plane hit the World Trade Center and 29 minutes after 9:05, when Bush was informed of the second plane crash and 2 In the days before 9/11, unknown traders bought unusually high “put options” in the stock of United Airlines, American Airlines, and the WTC tenants and reinsurers. This meant that the traders expected the prices of these equities to plunge in the short term. The volumes of the purchases may have activated a known CIA real-time tracing program designed to discover suspicious trades (PROMIS). The FBI later claimed it had determined the identities of the traders in the U.S., but says they are in the clear and declines to name them. Many of the known trades were transacted through A.B. Brown. The chairman of that bank, Mayo Shattuck, resigned suddenly on September 12. In the case of one trade, the buyer left $2.5 million uncollected for months after the attacks. Financial authorities in Frankfurt and Tokyo and an intelligence bureau in Israel also reported suspicious trades and initially characterized these as smoking guns that would lead back to the masterminds of 9/11. To our knowledge there has been no public follow-up to these statements since. In London, authorities said they traced the trades back to an unnamed “small airline” that was pursuing a “hedging strategy” ( IHT , 9/20/01). “To me luck is something that happens once. When you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols, broken laws, broken communication, one cannot still call it luck.” -Mindy Kleinberg 9/11 Families Steering Committee 3 George W. Bush at Booker Elementary"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"told, “America is under attack.” After the well-known moment, when his chief of staff whispered into his ear, Bush continued listen- ing to the children read. He remained in the classroom for about 13 minutes. He then pre- pared and delivered a brief speech to the nation from the school, calling for a moment of silence for the WTC victims at 9:31. The Pentagon was hit at 9:38. The White House has never explained this anomaly. Instead, Bush has twice claimed, in speeches made available on the White House website, that he thought the first plane crash (at 8:46 a.m.) was an accident. On hearing news of the crash at 8:55, he says he thought, “That’s one lousy pilot.” Yet the Federal A viation Administration was aware, since 8:20 at the latest, that American Airlines Flight 11 had been hijacked. The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) was also informed of the hijacking. And by 8:55 a.m. or shortly after, two addi- tional hijackings were known to be in progress. In the White House, Dick Cheney is known to have by then been on an open line connecting FAA, NORAD and the Secret Service. Yet as the attacks went on, the reac- tion times of U.S. air defense apparently became worse. W as no one telling the president all this? Who was acting as commander-in-chief, while Bush listened to “A Girl and Her Pet Goat”? W as there no concern that the school itself would be a target, since it was public knowl- edge, days in advance, that the president would be there? Courage to Ask the Obvious The family leaders have released a series of strongly worded statements blasting the Bush administration for stonewalling the 9/11 investigation. But they have been equally harsh in chastising the Kean Commission for its refusal to examine key evidence. They have called for the immediate resignation of Philip Zelikow, executive director of the commission, pointing to his various conflicts of interest. (See “The Rice/Zelikow Connection,” p. 6) The relatives have shown no reluctance to pursue controversial lines of inquiry in pub- lic. It is hard to imagine the commission ask- ing if the Bush administration tried to cut a deal with Osama Bin Laden in advance of the 9/11 attacks, as reported in the European press back in the autumn of 2001. But the families want an answer: “Did you or any agent of the United States government carry out any negotiations or talks with UBL, an agent of UBL, or al-Qaeda?” (“UBL” is government speak for Osama Bin Laden.) The Commission has shown no inclination to follow the trail of the Cheney “energy policy meetings” of early 2001, or the Bush admin- istration's oil-pipeline talks with the Taliban up to July 2001. These touchy subjects might arise if they ever considered this question: “During that same period, did you or any agent of the United States government carry out any negotiations or talks with any foreign govern- ment, its agents, or officials regarding UBL?” W ould the Kean Commission ever wonder out loud if anyone other than Al-Qaeda (or other foreigners) gained anything from the attacks? The family leaders have r eleased a series of strongly worded statements blasting the Bush administration for stonewalling the 9/11 investiga- tion. But they have been equal- ly harsh in chastising the Kean Commission for its refusal to examine key evidence. 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The families are not afraid to confront this obvious concern: “Which individuals, governments, agencies, institutions, or groups may have benefited from the attacks of 9/11?” Although the Kean Commission accepted a deal strictly limiting its access to White House documents concerning advance warnings of a possible terror attack, Kean claimed repeatedly that there is “no smoking gun” to indicate Bush had specific prior knowledge of the attacks. At least, not in the \"parts of the documents\" Kean has actually been allowed to see. The families don't buy that on faith, or on par- tial evidence. They want specifics: “As Commander-in-Chief, from May 1, 2001 until September 11, 2001, did you receive any information from any intelligence agency offi- cial or agent that UBL was planning to attack this nation on its own soil using airplanes as weapons, targeting New York City landmarks during the week of September 11, 2001 or on the actual day of September 11, 2001?” Carefully researched, the families’ questions reflect concerns that have caused millions to doubt the official story—and to call for a truly independent investigation: One with subpeona power, testimony under oath, no self-imposed restrictions on allowable lines of inquiry, and a published, uncensored final report. “Even now we are dealing with the idea of how the [commission] report is going to be, when it's released,” says Beverly Eckert of the FSC. “The classification process is done by the White House and the intelligence agencies. They are the ones. They are a subject of this report. How can they not have a conflict in classi- fying and editing it? They can edit at will.” Conspiracy Theory? It is hard to dismiss these concerns as “con- spiracy theory” when many Bush administra- tion officials used the most outrageous con- spiracy theory of all—the legend that Saddam backed the 9/11 attacks—as pretext for invad- ing Iraq. In that matter as well, the families want government held accountable: “Do you continue to maintain that Saddam Hussein was linked to al-Qaeda? What proof do you have of any connection between al- Qaeda and the Hussein regime?” Bush in the meantime has admitted there was no such connection. But Cheney and mem- bers of his circle still say there was. The FSC questions show that, though their grief and tragedy is great, the families have understood the stakes in the 9/11 disclosure issue are even greater. Getting the truth of 9/11 means more than justice for the victims. And well-deserved closure for their relatives. 9/11 was used as a lever to shift the globe. All Americans–and, given the global impact, the people of the world–need to learn the answers that the families demand. The Sept. 11 family statements, and their lists of questions to a variety of administration mem- bers, have been published at the FSC's website: www.911independentcommission.org 9/11 was used as a lever to shift the globe.

But most Americans still have never heard of the man who wrote a book with her, Philip Zelikow. As the executive director of the Kean Commission, Zelikow is responsible for framing the agenda. He leads the research staff. He decides what evidence the com- mission sees. In April, the world media focused on Rice’s appearance before the commission. She claimed, not for the first time, that no one could have imagined terrorists would use hijacked planes as weapons against buildings. This is a demonstrable falsehood, which Bush himself inadvertantly exposed a week later. (See “Bush, Rice and the Genoa W arning,” p. 15) Rice’s testimony received mostly bad reviews. The commission was credited with investigative fervor. Few reports bothered to note that in the late 1980s, Rice and Zelikow worked closely together on George H.W. Bush’s national security staff. Zelikow and Rice co-authored a 1999 book about their experiences in the first Bush White House, “Germany Unified and Europe T ransformed: A Study in Statecraft.” The book presents “a detailed and fascinating account of behind-the-scenes discussions and deliberations” during the fall of the Soviet empire, according to Library Journal . Zelikow again served alongside Rice as a member of the Bush transition team in 2000- 2001, when he took part in White House meetings on the terror threat. Since this was of interest to the 9/11 investigation, the Kean Commission recently called Zelikow as a wit- ness, in a closed-door session. Now imagine if the judge in a trial was a close associate of the star witness. Imagine if the judge called himself as a witness to the case, in secret testimony. A parallel situation has arisen, with Zelikow in the role of the judge, and Rice as the star witness. Even after September 11, two days before the invasion of Afghanistan, Zelikow went back to work for the Bush national security staff, as a member of the White House advisory board on foreign intelligence. Zelikow’s evident conflicts of interest prompted September 11 family leaders to call for his resignation months ago. “It is apparent that Dr. Zelikow should never have been per- mitted to be Executive Staff Director of the Commission,” the Family Steering Committee concluded in a March 20 state- ment. So far, the commission has ignored their plea. The Rice/Zelikow connection should have set off alarm bells about the Kean Commission’s independence. Yet it has barely caused a stir.

These people [the com- missioners] are all a part of it. In many ways the government is part of the problem.” By a hair’s breadth, what we know now as the Kean Commission almost went down in his- tory as the “Kissinger Commission.” Soon after assenting to an independent investiga- tion, George W. Bush kicked it off in Nov. 2002 by appointing Henry Kissinger to chair the panel. T wo weeks later, Kissinger declined the appointment. The families and a few of the legislators designing the commission had asked him to rule out possible conflicts of interest involving his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates. Kissinger refused to name his clients, even confidentially. In a let- ter to Bush, he opined that service to country would ruin his business. During the two weeks of Kissinger’s appointment, the Internet and alternative press buzzed at the thought of a 9/11 inves- tigation headed by Richard Nixon’s former secretary of state, a known practitioner of the strategic lie. Kissinger remains an elder adviser to many of the key people in the administration and U.S. defense establish- ment, especially the neoconservative group at the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld. He is under investigation in several countries for alleged involvement in Nixon-era crimes against humanity in Chile, Indochina and elsewhere. During a Paris hotel stay in 2001, he received a surprise visit for ques- tioning by a French magistrate, and had to quietly slip out of the country. The failed Kissinger appointment was a glob- al public relations disaster, but perhaps the administration felt it needed a cover-up artist of his caliber. Soon after his departure, the job of heading the 9/11 Commission went to Kean, a less controversial figure who was more willing to reveal his business connec- tions. One of these is worthy of a brief detour. New Jersey to Afghanistan Before taking his current position, Thomas Kean was a director and part owner of Amerada Hess, a company that maintained a partnership with Delta Oil of Saudi Arabia. Since that is the home country for most of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, and since the Bush family has close business ties to Saudi elites, many people would think that this is already a serious conflict of interest. T ogether with UNOCAL, Delta Oil in the mid-1990s began negotiating deals with Central Asian governments, looking to acquire pipeline rights out of the world's rich- est remaining store of undeveloped oil fields. The favored plan was to get the oil to a port in Pakistan - meaning, through Taliban-con- trolled Afghanistan. The Taliban were court- ed in the late 1990s by a number of American oil projects, including UNOCAL’s. But their hardline behavior ruined their international image, and the companies backed off. When the Bush administration came to power in 2001, it opened new pipeline negotiations with the the Taliban. Despite awards to Afghanistan of $143 million in U.S. aid in the first half of 2001, the Taliban refused to accept the U.S. proposal of a joint govern- ment with the Northern Alliance. They broke off the back-channel Berlin talks in June. At the time, a U.S. representative promised that the Taliban had a choice between “a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs.” The White House has admitted that docu- ments placed on Bush’s desk on Sept. 9, 2001 detailed a plan for attacking Afghanistan by mid-Oct. 2001. Significant deployments to the region of U.S. and British forces were already underway. All that was missing for an invasion was the casus belli - the cause for hostilities. That arrived two days later, in New York, in the form of the 9/11 attacks. Thomas Kean 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The subsequent U.S. inva- sion of Afghanistan installed Hamid Karzai as prime minister and Zalmay Khalilzad as the powerful White House envoy to Kabul. Interestingly, both men were previously employed as consultants by UNOCAL. The new Afghan government has since entered a pipeline con- sortium. UNOCAL is not known to be involved, but is seen within the industry as the likely ultimate beneficiary of a future pipeline. In other words, 9/11 became the reason for an already-planned war in Afghanistan, as a result of which a long-delayed Afghan pipeline deal was struck. Given that context, the appointment as commission chair of an any oil company director - let alone the direc- tor of one involved in a Central Asian pipeline consortium - appears improper. But within the commission, Gov. Kean’s involvement is by no means exceptional. A look at the member resumes shows that almost all of them have had business ties to oil companies - or else, airlines. Pipelines and Airlines After Kean’s appointment, the White House shifted from resisting the very idea of an investigation to the more mundane matter of obstructing it. Although the commissioners were all government and national security insiders, getting security clearances took months. For most of the first year, the White House claimed executive privilege in with- holding access to the Presidential Daily Briefings. The rules were fashioned so that issuing a subpeona required a majority vote. Bush initially approved a budget of just $3 million for the panel, which requires a staff of dozens to comb through millions of docu- ments. Only after months of wrangling did the White House give in to an additional $8 million in funding. 1 Congressional Democrats and Republicans and the White House set out to apportion the seats in what was termed a bipartisan manner, meaning five for each party. Kean's vice-chair, Lee Hamilton, was the chair- man in the 1980s of the House Select Committee on Iran/Contra. Afterwards, he told PBS Frontline that he didn't wish to indict Reagan or Bush, because he didn't think it would be “good for the country,” although a wealth of evidence showed that Reagan and Bush authorized illegal arms shipments to Iran in 1985. Then Chairman Hamilton, a Democrat, was influenced by heavy political pressure from a hawkish fel- low congressman from Wyoming by the name of Dick Cheney. The New York Post and FOX NEWS have yet to report any of the above details concerning Zelikow, Kean or Hamilton, but in April they devoted much energy to exposing commis- sion member Jamie Gorelick, who served on Bill Clinton’s national security staff. The Murdoch media and Republican politicians have said she is too partisan to serve on the commission, and urged that she resign. In May 2003, shortly after joining the Kean Commission, Gorelick also joined the W ashington firm of W ilmer, Cutler & Pickering. A month earli- er, this firm announced it would defend Saudi Prince Mohammed al Faisal, third in com- mand in the Saudi government–and a plaintiff 1 By comparison, the Columbia Space Shuttle explosion led to immediate approval of $30 million for a commission within a week.

Richard Ben-Veniste, for- mer Clinton White House lawyer, was a partner until February 2003 in one of the biggest bankruptcy firms in the world, Weil, Gotshal, and Manges. As the N.Y.

Slade Gorton is a lawyer in the Seattle firm of Preston, Gates and Ellis, which counts among its clients both Delta Air Lines and the Boeing Employees’ Credit Union. Is either of them likely to want the airlines forced to pay off lawsuits from September 11 relatives? While Henry Kissinger did not make the cut, he does have close ties to Republican John Lehman, whom he recruited for his staff during the Nixon administration. Lehman, the secretary of the Navy under the Reagan adminis- tration, is also close to several members of the current Bush government. Along with Kean, Hamilton, and Gorelick, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). As for former Illinois Governor James R. Thompson, it really takes no rocket science to figure out his conflict of interest. He is chairman of the W inston & Strawn law firm in Chicago. From Jan. 1997 through June 2002, Thompson’s law firm received $1.66 million for federal lobbying efforts on behalf of American Airlines—one of the two carriers potentially liable for negligence on 9/11. Commission Cuts Deal with White House Under a deal the Kean Commission made with the White House in Nov. 2003, Jamie Gorelick is the only commissioner–alongside Executive Director Philip Zelikow– allowed to view White House documents, such as the famous Presidential Daily Briefing entitled “BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO STRIKE IN U.S.” That document (of which the government recently published 1 1/2 pages out of 11) was delivered from George Tenet to George Bush on Aug. 6, 2001. Gorelick is a long-standing T enet associate and an adviser to the CIA. Once again, the investigator is on the friendliest terms with the subject of the investigation. While viewing White House documents, she and Zelikow are allowed to take notes, which remain with the White House. They then report to the other commission members. At one point, the White House withheld the notes. The commission was said to be debat- ing a subpoena for its own notes, instead of the actual documents. Max Cleland Drops Out Max Cleland, the former Democratic Senator from Georgia, objected strenu- ously to the deal restrict- ing access to White House documents. In the course of autumn 2003, he issued a challenge to both the White House and his fellow members of the Kean Commission. “Bush is scamming America,” Cleland declared. “As each day goes by, we learn that this government knew a whole lot more about these terrorists before September 11 than R.

( Salon , November 2003) “They had a plan to go to war, and when 9/11 happened that's what they did. They went to war.” He called this “a national scandal.” Cleland compared the Kean Commission to the earlier investigation of the Kennedy Assassination. “The Warren Commission blew it. I’m not going to be part of that. I’m not going to be part of looking at information only partially. I’m not going to be part of just coming to quick conclusions. I’m not going to be part of political pressure to do this or not do that.” At the time of Cleland’s impassioned out- bursts, the hearings were not even covering September 11, but issues of Homeland Security. The commission was barely a blip on the media radar. Aside from the Salon interview, Cleland’s revolt was treated to cur- sory coverage in a total of two other outlets: the T imes and the W ashington Post . In the midst of an apparent news black-out, follow- ers of the commission process were not even sure if Cleland had resigned. In December, Bush stepped in and settled the question. He appointed Cleland to direct the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Cleland accepted, and left the Commission. Ignoring the Elephant Max Cleland’s departure exposed the com- mission’s conflicts of interest and willingness to compromise its mission. Despite reports of turmoil behind the scenes, the public conse- quences approached nil. Y et it was also a chance for the panel to change course, to address the issues he raised. Activists launched a campaign to nominate a member of the Family Steering Committee to fill the vacancy. Did the commission have room for one person who is not a government insider, and who has a clear incentive to seek the truth? A well-known FSC member expressed her willingness to serve. Calls and faxes advocating her nomination poured in from around the country to the offices of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. He had nominated Cleland, and therefore got to choose the replacement. At the commission’s next public session on December 8, 2003, Cleland went unmen- tioned until the closing press conference, when a reporter asked Kean and Hamilton how they intended to restore the commis- sion’s credibility. Both proclaimed, needless- ly, that Cleland was a man of integrity, with- out addressing anything he had said. In addition, confronted with open-source evi- dence of U.S. military preparations for the 9/11 scenario prior to September 11 (the Pentagon MASCAL exercise, see p. 11), they gave their usual answer, which can be summed up as follows: “We are grateful. Please provide us with these materials. We will pursue all leads.” The materials were duly provided. The next day, Daschle filled the vacancy with former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, presi- dent of The New School University and an outspoken hardliner on homeland security issues. (Kerrey was also a member of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, which lobbied foreign countries to support the oust- ing of Saddam Hussein.) The decision had been made. The 9/11 Commission had room for no one but insiders. Leaving aside the behind-the-scenes stories and conflicts of interest we have detailed, does the commission truly pursue all leads? In the next article, a case study of how the commission operates in public, we shall see what happened when its members had a gold- en opportunity to ask top Pentagon officials about the wargames of September 11. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"“I had no idea hijacked airliners would be used as weapons.” So said Rumsfeld, in his opening remarks to the Kean Commission on March 23, 2004.

There were more cameras on Clarke than on anyone else during the two-day national broadcast of the commission hearings. In reality, his testimo- ny was nowhere near as interesting as the joint appearance by Donald Rumsfeld, Paul W olfowitz and Richard Myers the day before. I do not question Clarke’s sincerity at this time, just the timing, which he did not choose. His book was released at a time cho- sen by the White House, and the testimony depended on the book. He had finished it well over 6 months before, but it was held up by the White House security clearance. As a result, the book came out on the eve of Rumsfeld's sworn testimony to the 9/11 Commission. Very clever if intentional, because it distracted everyone from two issues completely ignored by the commis- sioners, and overshadowed by Clarke and his book when they questioned Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld: ISSUE #1 – On the morning of September 11, 2001, NORAD was running war games involving the scenario of hijacked airliners, while the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) was running a drill for the scenario of an errant aircraft crashing into a government building, at the exact same time as an identi- cal scenario was perpetrated in reality. The Air Force was in day two of annual drills testing all of its systems to respond to various threats. What role, if any, did Secretary Rumsfeld, Undersecretary Wolfowitz, and acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers play in any war game scenario on the morning of September 11, 2001? What briefings did they receive about these wargames before, during, and after the morning in question? ISSUE #2 – On October 24, 2000, a mass casualty (MASCAL) emergency drill was conducted to test the Pentagon’s response to an airliner crashing into its headquar- ters. In the situa- tion room, a model plane was set aflame within a scale model of the building, while emergency crews were dis- patched to various places around the real building to test their response times. A mil- itary web site later published news of the exercise, with pictures. What did then Defense Secretary William Cohen tell his successor, Rumsfeld, about this drill during the transition process from the Clinton to Bush administrations? THE 9/11 COVER-UP MAY 18, 2004 The Total Failure Of the Kean Commission Case study: How the Commission went easy on Rumsfeld, Myers and Wolfowitz By Michael Kane   March 27, 2004 Donald Rumsfeld Pentagon Mass Casualty Exercise - Oct. 24, 2000 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Now how is it possible these two questions were “overlooked”? Cover-Up Commission – Skillful Delusion Richard Ben-Veniste grilled Rumsfeld on the well-known threat of aircraft being used as weapons. In his long list of precedents for hijacked aircraft and attempted kamikaze attacks, Ben-Veniste conveniently left out the Oct 24, 2000 drill directly involving the Pentagon. (It should be noted that Ben- V eniste was Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Senate-appointed lawyer during Whitewater, as well as the attorney for Barry Seal, who use to fly cocaine from Honduras up to the Contra supply base at Mena, Arkansas while Bill Clinton was governor.) Of extreme interest was CIA adviser Jamie Gorelick’s question to Rumsfeld, following on Ben-Veniste’s line of questioning. She recalled being in a room with Wolfowitz, planning for the possibility of terrorists hijacking an airliner and crashing it into the Olympics. She found it incomprehensible that the possibility of this happening at the Pentagon had never occurred to either W olfowitz or Rumsfeld. But Gorelick also mentioned nothing about the October 24, 2000 drill at the Pentagon itself. She went on to ask specific questions about when an order to authorize fighter pilots to shoot down aircraft was issued on the morning of September 11. Rumsfeld complicated and confused the question by shifting the focus to later in the day and describing how the events of the day modified the rules of engagement. General Myers clarified by stating that, to the best of his recollection, the shoot-down order was communicated directly to the pilots shortly after the president issued it. (This was in contra- diction to his testimony before the Senate of 9/13/01 - see p. 12) GORELICK: Was it your understanding that the NORAD pilots who were circling over W ashington D.C. that morning had indeed received a shoot-down order? RUMSFELD: When I arrived in the com- mand center, one of the first things I heard, and I was with you, was that the order had been given and that the pilots—correction, not the pilots necessarily, but the command had been given the instructions that their pilots could, in fact, use their weapons to shoot down commercial airliners filled with our people in the event that the aircraft appeared to be behaving in a threatening way and an unresponsive way. GORELICK: Now, you make a distinction there between the command and the pilots. W as it your understanding that the pilots had received that order? RUMSFELD: I’m trying to get in time because... MYERS: Well, I think—my understanding, I've talked to General Eberhart, commander now [sic] of NORAD, and I think he’s briefed the staff. And I think what he told the staff, what he told me, as I recall, was that the pilots Richard B. Myers Officials at NORAD have said that when the hijackings first occurred, they initially thought it was part of the V igilant Guardian drills run- ning that morning. Despite some confusion, once Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:45 a.m., everyone should have known this was not a test. 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"did—at the appropriate point when the authority to engage civilian airliners was given, that the pilots knew that fairly quickly. I mean, it went down through the chain of command. (...) RUMSFELD: (...) The reason I am hesitant is because we went through two or three itera- tions of the rules of engagement. And in the end, we ended up delegating that authority to, at the lowest level, I believe, to two stars. MYERS: Right. RUMSFELD: And the pilot would then describe the situation to that level. To the extent that level had time, they would come up to General Eberhart. To the extent Eberhart had time, he would come up to me. And to the extent I had time, I might talk to the president, which in fact, I did do on sev- eral occasions during the remainder of the day with respect to international flights head- ing to this country that were squawking “hijack.” GORELICK: I’m just trying to understand whether it is your understanding that the NORAD pilots themselves, who were cir- cling over Washington, as you referred to in your statement, whether they knew that they had authority to shoot down a plane (...) RUMSFELD: I do not know what they thought. In fact, I haven’t talked to any of the pilots that were up there. I certainly was immediately concerned that we did know what they thought they could do. At first glance this seems like semantics, but in the context of what was really happening that day it may be quite significant. Whether or not a pilot has a shoot-down order directly communicated to him is of the highest signif- icance given the fact that the pilot may not have known if he was still in one of the war games scheduled for that day. Officials at NORAD have said that when the hijackings first occurred, they initially thought it was part of the Vigilant Guardian drills running that morning. Despite some confusion, once Flight 11 struck the World T rade Center at 8:45 a.m., everyone should have known this was not a test. However, this is still an assumption, because we do not know what the fighter jocks in the air at the time knew and did not know. We do not know the full extent of the orders they received, and it has never been explained why scrambled fighters were unable to intercept any of the hijacked airliners. Scrambling aircraft simply means providing an Air Force escort to survey the situation. This has nothing to do with shooting down an aircraft. Such scrambling procedures occurred 67 times in the year prior to 9/11. The concept of this simple standard operating procedure failing from 8:28 a.m., when Flight 11 made an unplanned 100 degree turn to the south, until 9:38 a.m., when the Pentagon was struck, is inconceivable without a military order. Such an order, or multiple orders causing ‘confu- sion’, may have been scripted into the war game scenarios that morning. We do not know if this is the case, and it seems the Kean Commission doesn’t want to know, either. It is possible that information regarding the war games running on the morning of 9/11 has been classified and cannot be discussed in public hearings. Considering the fact that the information provided here is open source and has been published by the likes of Jane’s Defense Weekly and the Associated Press, classifying the subject as a whole does not in any way help national security. If we do not face what really happened that morning, our national security is truly in jeopardy. What was Rumsfeld doing on September 11? In the past, Rumsfeld has gone on record say- ing that on the morning of September 11, he was in the Pentagon giving a lecture to mem- bers of Congress. He warned them to “expect the unexpected” with future terrorist attacks. Shortly thereafter, he was handed a note stating that the North Tower had been struck. Soon 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"after that, he was told the second tower was hit. Rumsfeld claimed he continued with his lec- ture until the Pentagon was struck, at 9:38. This makes absolutely no sense. If the Secretary of Defense is lecturing to a Congressional delegation about the danger of surprise terrorist attacks, and if in the middle of that he is told two planes have hit both W orld Trade Center towers, it is beyond belief that he continues his presentation without reacting to the ‘unexpected’ terrorist attack. The fact that not one member of the Kean Commission chose to scrutinize Rumsfeld’s well-known statements speaks volumes. W illful Reckless Wanton or Treason? The Project for the New American Century (PNAC), a non-profit organization founded in 1997 by prominent Republican leaders, called for a transformation of America to exercise military total spectrum dominance and unchallenged worldwide hegemony. The PNAC program, in a nutshell: America’s military must rule out even the possibility of a serious global or regional challenger anywhere in the world. The regime of Saddam Hussein must be toppled immediately, by U.S. force if necessary. And the entire Middle East must be re- ordered according to an American plan. PNAC’s most important study notes that selling this plan to the American people will likely take a long time, “absent some cata- strophic catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.” (PNAC, Rebuilding America’s Defenses (1997), p.51) A catalyzing catastrophe did come, and since September 11 the policies that PNAC promoted have been put in place by PNAC’s own members. They occupy nearly all of the key positions in the Bush administration national security appa- ratus. Paul Wolfowitz, who was under oath alongside Rumsfeld at the March 23 testi- mony, signed on to the PNAC document which specifically referred to a “new Pearl Harbor” in a favorable light (in September 2000). Donald Rumsfeld was a signatory to the PNAC mission statement, along with admin- istration stalwarts Dick Cheney, John Negroponte, Elliot Abrams, Otto Reich and Zalmay Khalilzad, as well as Jeb Bush. For all of them, the Project for a New American Century amounts to a kind of public oath. The mission statement and the entire PNAC plan were published on the web at newamerican- century.org, years before the Bush adminis- tration came to power. Since all of this information is open source, how is it that the commission managed to entirely ignore it when they questioned Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Myers? Paul Wolfowitz 14 Curious Evidence The State Department in September 2001 promised a paper to prove the guilt of Bin Laden. It was never published. Why? British premier Tony Blair instead provided a weak circumstantial case in his White Paper a few weeks later. The State Department did, however, provide a misleading translation to make it appear that Bin Laden (or some- one who looks like him) confessed to 9/11 in a November 2001 video, which was found under suspicious circumstances in Afghanistan. ( ARD-TV , Germany) Meanwhile, the FBI announced one of the flight hijacker s passports was discovered in the Ground Zero rubble, on September 11 itself. A search of a Florida motel room where two hijackers stayed two weeks ear- lier yielded incriminating documents that they forgot there, and which had not been found by the cleaning personnel. These are only two examples of the investigators incredible lucky streak. Y et how do these stories square with the admission, seven months later, by FBI Director Robert Mueller that, In our investi- gation, we have not uncovered a single piece of paper either here in the United States or in the treasure trove of informa- tion that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere that mentioned any aspect of the September 11 plot.\" (San Francisco speech, 4/19/2002)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"“I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon, that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.” –Condoleezza Rice, May 16, 2002 Late 1980s, throughout the 1990s: The idea of using hijacked planes as weapons against buildings becomes common. There are attempted kamikaze attacks involving hijacked planes in Israel (1986), Turkey (1993) and France (1994). A suicide Cessna pilot hits the White House on Sept. 12, 1994. Tom Clancy publishes a novel in which the villain crashes an airliner into the Capitol (1994). Pentagon scenario planners bring up the possibility of a kamikaze-hijacking in a variety of reports (twice in 1993; 1999; 2000). Mid-1990s: News reports and trial cases reveal that Ramzi Y ussef (convicted mastermind of the 1993 W orld Trade Center bombing) devised “Project Bojinka,” a plot including the idea of crashing hijacked airliners into American tar- gets. Foreign and U.S. intelligence and defense agencies issue warnings and devise defense scenarios relating to the possibility that some- thing like “Project Bojinka” can be attempted anywhere, at any time. October 2000: The Department of Defense responds compe- tently to these developments, by rehearsing a MASCAL (mass casualty) exercise based on the scenario of a plane crashing into the Pentagon. The live exercise of Oct. 24, 2000 involves rescue crews directed from a com- mand center. A paper plane is set aflame with- in a scale model of the building. A military news-site later publishes an article about it. NOTE: The Pentagon is known to be ringed with anti-aircraft batteries. March 2001: In the pilot episode of a short-lived TV series, “The Lone Gunmen,” the heroes narrowly avert the crashing of a remote-hijacked pas- senger plane into the WTC North Tower. This shows that even TV writers are speculating that someone could crash a hijacked plane into the Twin Towers. April 2001: According to news stories of 4/13/04, the Defense Department considers holding yet another live exercise to rehearse for the contingency of a hijacked plane crashing into the Pentagon. June 2001: The mass media warn that Osama Bin Laden is preparing to strike again. Sources report he has new and outlandish “Hollywood” ideas, like crashing a plane loaded with explosives into George W. Bush’s hotel at the July 2001 Summit of G-8 nations in Genoa, Italy. TIME Magazine : “According to German intelligence sources, the plot involved Bin Laden paying German neo-Nazis to fly remote controlled model aircraft packed with Semtex into the con- ference hall and blow the leaders of the indus- trialized world to smithereens. (Paging Jerry Bruckheimer...)” TIME also writes, “If Bin Laden didn’t exist, we’d have to invent him.” July 3, 2001: Bush biographer Jim Hatfield picks up on the “Genoa Warning.” In an article for Online Journal , he jokes: “Why would Osama want to kill his business partner?” He exposes a few facts about the Bush-Bin Ladin family business connections (The Carlyle Group) and about the CIA’s historic relationship with Al-Qaeda. Hatfield guesses that the CIA itself is spreading the Genoa rumor, in an effort to pump up Bush's sagging popularity.

July 20, 2001: G-8 Summit opens. Italy, citing the air-attack warnings, closes Genoa International Airport and installs anti-aircraft batteries around the G- 8 Summit locations. The U.S. Secret Service is apparently not satisfied. For safety, Bush and his entourage spend at least one night on a U.S. aircraft carrier. On the same night, Putin, Schroeder and Chirac carouse with Blair on an Adriatic cruise ship. Meanwhile, Genoa is under martial law. Italian federal stormtroops in Darth Vader cos- tumes enclose entire neighborhoods with mile- long, barbed-wire fences. Hooded undercover agents roam in the guise of “black-bloc” pro- testers. They start riots and then retreat behind federal Italian police lines. This is filmed from helicopters by the local police of Genoa, who object to the extreme measures. One protester is shot dead. (ARD-TV, Germany) August 6, 2001: Bush receives a memorandum from CIA Director George Tenet entitled, “BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO STRIKE IN U.S.” This “Presidential Daily Briefing” or PDB warns of potential terrorist hijackings in U.S. airspace. The PDB later becomes the object of a tug of war between the White House and the Kean Commission. September 11, 2001: Early in the morning, the U.S. military begins air defense and mass casualty wargames. So far, we know definitely of: 1) a NORAD exercise known as “Vigilant Guardian,” which included hijacking simula- tions and possibly involved the projection of false blips onto military radar screens; and 2) an air-crash fire-drill at the National Reconaissance Office near Washington, four miles from Dulles Airport. The NRO is the headquarters of the U.S. satellite surveillance system, which is run jointly by the CIA and Pentagon. Suddenly, the wargames are interrupted by word that a passenger plane from Logan Airport really has been hijacked. When the news arrives at a nearby airbase, the first ques- tion is: “Is this part of the exercise?” ( A viation Weekly , September 2002) September 27, 2001: The LA Times reports on the “Genoa W arning.” Now Italian sources claim they developed the intelligence themselves. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also says he warned Bush that Bin Laden wanted to launch a kamikaze attack on the G-8 Summit. How did news of the plot circulate among the intelligence agencies of several countries? May 15, 2002: The White House admits the existence of the August 6 PDB. The New York Post headlines the news: “Bush Knew.” The next day, Condoleeza Rice proclaims that “no one could have imagined” planes would be used as weapons. She says the warnings to Bush relat- ed only to “traditional hijackings,” not kamikaze attacks. March and April, 2004: In testimony to the Kean Commission, both Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleeza Rice once again insist that no one could have imagined hijacked planes would be used as weapons against buildings. Meanwhile, the White House finally gives in and publishes 1 1/2 pages (out of 11 total) of the August 6, 2001 PDB. What does the rest say? April 13, 2004: At an evening press conference, Bush connects the “Genoa Warning” (kamikaze attacks) to the Presidential Daily Briefing of Aug. 6th, 2001 (domestic hijackings). “And I asked for the briefing [the PDB],” he says. “And the reason I did is because there had been a lot of threat intelligence from overseas. And so, I – part of it had to do with the Genoa G-8 conference that I was going to attend. And I asked at that point in time, let's make sure we are paying attention here at home, as well. And that's what triggered the report.” Could “no one have imagined”? Perhaps inadvertantly, Bush has exposed his own national security adviser and his Secretary of Defense as liars. 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 Ahmad, Tenet, Goss and Graham: Pakistan’s powerful Interservices Intelligence Agency (ISI), which in the 1990s created and trained the Taliban, maintains close ties to U.S. intelligence. By treaty, the ISI chief is approved by the CIA. On September 11, that was Gen. Mahmoud Ahmad. He was in W ashington when the attacks occurred, on a visit since September 4 to meet with his counterpart at the CIA, George Tenet, and other officials. The W all Street Journal later reported that ISI provided financing to the alleged 9/11 hijackers. Indian intelligence sources said Ahmad directly approved a wire of $100,000 to Mohamed Atta. On the morn- ing of September 11, Ahmad was at the Capitol, meeting with the heads of the Congressional intelligence committees, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss. At the insistence of the FBI, Ahmad was fired from his post a month later, as the Pakistani cabinet was reshuffled on the eve of the U.S. offen- sive in Afghanistan. Graham and Goss went on to lead the 2002 Congressional joint inquiry of 9/11. Their final, 800-page report makes no mention of Pakistan in any context. Shouldn’t they—and Tenet—at least explain what they were doing with Ahmad? The Hush Money Fund: “The victims fund was not created in a spirit of compassion,” September 11 family leader Beverly Eckert wrote in USA Today (12/19/03). “Rather, it was a tacit acknowl- edgement by Congress that it tampered with our civil justice system in an unprecedented way. Lawmakers capped the liability of the airlines at the behest of lobbyists who descended on Washington while the September 11 fires still smoldered.” Compensation for victim families under the government fund is similar to that normally gained in other sudden-death cases, but one condition is unprecedented: those who file for awards, which average $1.8 million per death, must forego litigation against U.S. companies or government agencies. At least 50 families are known to have therefore refused the fund presided over by Kenneth Feinberg, among them Eckert. “Litigation has many facets,” she says. “It’s a fact-finding mechanism, through discovery and deposi- tions. This is not about vengeance. I certainly do want people to be held accountable... The Commission unfortunately has taken a very kid-gloves approach to their fact-finding. A courtroom is a battleground, and that's what we need to get to the bottom of everything.” Poisoning New York: “The collapse of the Twin Towers and the underground fire emitted the largest concen- tration ever measured in the U.S. of nanosize, extremely toxic submicroscopic metals and superfine particles,” says geoscientist Leuren Moret (University of Berkeley). But New Y orkers will remember that in the days after 9/11, EPA chief Christie Whitman felt confi- dent enough to announce that no special pre- cautions were required to protect against the dust cloud engulfing the city. A new study by the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine environ- mental program now details serious health consequences for rescue workers and babies born to expectant mothers exposed to the smoke. This comes as no surprise to the many thousands of New Yorkers suffering from persistent “Ground Zero cough.” Why did Whitman rush to give obviously premature and reckless reassurances? Disposing of Ground Zero: Michael Manning is the editor of Fire Engineering, the nation’s oldest and most important firefighter's magazine. He pub- lished a blistering January 2002 editorial crit- icizing the disposal of evidence at Ground Zero, in violation of regulations that required THE 9/11 COVER-UP MAY 18, 2004 Before the Kean Commission The cover-up from 9/11 to 2003: An overview"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"a full forensic reconstruction of the tower col- lapse mechanics. Debris was not kept at the Staten Island landfill, but shipped straight to scrap recyclers in China and India. As a result, scientists today theorize about the collapse, but they have lost most of the physical evidence they need to figure out what actually happened. (In a bizarre twist, photographers were arrested even for taking unauthorized photos of the Ground Zero site during the clean-up.) W asn't Ground Zero a crime scene? One former cop, Frank Serpico, had this to say: “The mayor of New York, TIME Magazine’s [2001] Man of the Year, ordered thousands of tons of WTC steel sold and melted down before a proper investigation of the greatest crime scene the country ever witnessed could be conducted. Something foul smelling about that.” Stonewalling: When the anthrax attacks began in October 2001, the FBI pulled most of the agents working on the 9/11 investigation. Months later, Dick Cheney informed the “anthraxed” Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, that a “shadow government” with no Congressional input had been activated on September 11—and was still in opera- tion. In January 2002, Cheney and Bush pressured Daschle to delay a Congressional investigation of September 11. That March, Rep. Cynthia McKinney was castigated merely for asking who may have known what in advance of 9/11. The administra- tion’s refusal to give any information about 9/11 began to crack in May, when the White House admitted receiving an advance warn- ing about domestic hijackings. That story was buried in a sudden avalanche of FBI terror warnings originating from an Al- Qaeda prisoner at Guantanomo, Abu Zubaydah. (He later confessed he was get- ting many of his ideas from the film, “Godzilla.”) The Congressional Joint Inquiry: Finally, in the spring of 2002, the Congressional intelligence committees set out to conduct a joint inquiry of September 1 1. They hired an executive director, former CIA official Brit Snider, who was fired after undisclosed conflicts behind the scenes. In the summer of 2002, the FBI (a subject of the investigation) made an unprecedent- ed demand that senators on the panel take lie-detector tests to trace a leak that was said to have angered Dick Cheney. It later turned out that the leak originated with Cheney's office. However, by then it was apparently no longer worth investigating. (John Prados, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist, As with the later 9/11 Commission, the public hearings avoided most of the actual questions of September 11, and concentrat- ed on homeland security. One exception was the testimony of New Jersey widow Kristen Breitweiser which was ignored. (see “The Kean Commission and the September 11th Families”, p. 2) In the end, the inquiry submitted an 800- page report (December 2002). It was pub- lished six months later, with one-quarter blacked out—including an entire 28-page chapter and a glossary item. (!) An appen- dix by several senators noted that only the committee chairs actually had access to any significant evidence during the inquiry. As for Graham, he told the Washington Post that the most important facts about Sept. 1 1—which he implied involved complicity by more than one U.S. ally—had yet to be revealed. “But maybe it will all come out in 30 years,” Graham said.

Post 9/11 9/13/01 Senate confirmation hearings for Gen. Myers as Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. Myers says, “to the best of my knowledge,” no order was given to scramble interceptor planes until after the Pentagon was hit (9:38). NOTE: Elsewhere, Myers stated he went into a Capitol Hill meeting with Sen. Cleland right after the first crash, and only heard later that this was not accident—only moments before he was told that the Pentagon had been hit. 9/16/01 On “Meet the Press,” Cheney reveals that FAA, NORAD and other services maintained a joint line of communication on the morning Sept. 11. He also says, \"The toughest decision was this question of whether or not we would intercept incoming commercial aircraft.\" NOTE: Interception of errant aircraft (not shootdown) is a standard operating procedure, historically not requiring an order from the upper chain of command. 9/18/01 NORAD releases timeline detailing when it received errant aircraft alerts from FAA and issued interception orders. Timeline shows interceptor planes were scrambled before 9:38, contradicting Myers’s testimony to Senate. NOTE: Timeline indicates FAA took up to 27 minutes to inform NORAD of the AA11 diversion; as little as one minute to inform NORAD of the UA175 diversion; and at least 34 minutes to inform NORAD of the AA77 diversion. No times are specified for UA93. 5/21/03 FA A issues statement on “FAA Communications with NORAD On September 11, 2001” as a “clarification” to the Kean Commission: “Within minutes after the first aircraft hit the World T rade Center, the FAA immediately established several phone bridges that included FAA field facilities, the FAA Command Center, FAA headquarters, DOD, the Secret Service, and other government agencies. The US Air Force liaison to the FAA immediately joined the FA A headquarters phone bridge and established contact with NORAD on a separate line. The FA A shared real-time information on the phone bridges about the unfolding events, including information about loss of communication with aircraft, loss of transponder signals, unautho rized changes in course, and other actions being taken by all the flights of interest, including Flight 77. Other parties on the phone bridges, in turn, shared information about actions they were taking. NORAD logs indicate that the FAA made formal notification about American Flight 77 at 9:24 a.m., but information about the flight was conveyed continuously during the phone bridges before the formal notification.” NOTE: Transcripts of the above communications are known to exist. 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Produced by NY 9/11 TRUTH Since January 2004, the members of NY 9/11 Truth have held a “Vigil for Truth” at Ground Zero every Saturday at Noon.
