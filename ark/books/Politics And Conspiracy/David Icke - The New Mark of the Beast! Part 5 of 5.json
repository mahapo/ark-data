Too many people believe the technology to \"buy and sell\" with an implantable chip is complicated and that the chip must be updatable -- not true, as you shall soon see!The New World Order is coming! Are you ready? Once you understand what this New World Order really is, and how it is being gradually implemented, you will be able to see it progressing in your daily news!! Learn how to protect yourself, your loved ones! Stand by for insights so startling you will never look at the news the same way again. YOU ARE NOW ON THE CUTTING EDGE We have posted four previous articles on this subject, of the human implantable chip known as \"M.M.E.A. - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY\". Not only is this chip far more sophisticated than any other chip on the marketplace, it is the only one in which the Federal Government is pouring Research and Development monies -- a most telling fact! We have always been on the lookout for the telltale sign of government funding, feeling that the government would seriously fund the research necessary to bring only the one final chip to perfection so Antichrist could use it as he is prophesied.Let us first review the first four articles in this subject; if you have not yet read these articles, we encourage you to do so now.NEWS1875 -- D.A.R.P.A. IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN\"DIGITAL ANGEL\"! M.M.E.A. - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY IS SO ADVANCED IT CAN FULFILL REV 13:16-18! Part 1 of 5-- We explain the actual science of MMEA in this article so you can see how all humans on earth can be completely controlled by this implantable chip! Emotions - fear, euphoria, depression -- plus pleasure and pain, can be controlled and even caused, by R.F. (Radio-Frequency signal)!http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (1 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKNEWS1875b - D.A.R.P.A. IS FUNDING AN IMPLANTABLE CHIP FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN\"DIGITAL ANGEL\"! M.M.E.A. - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY - Part 2 of 5-- The source of final Research and Development funds is always the telltale sign as to what the product is ultimately designed for, so we discuss the draconian nature of D.A.R.P.A.NEWS1875c - M.M.E.A. - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY IS SEEN BY OCCULTISTS AS \"TRANSCENDENCE\", A MEANS BY WHICH MANKIND SHALL MAKE THAT \"PARADIGM JUMP\" IN CONSCIOUSNESS TO BECOME GOD! - Part 3 of 5- \"The Brain Machine Interfaces Program technology is just another church, a place to worship\" - Just a the Bible predicts, this implantable chip is aimed toward worship!NEWS1875d - M.M.E.A. - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY IMPLANTABLE CHIP -- IS IT JUST ANOTHER \"SATANIC INSERT\" WHICH HAVE BEEN USED BY COVENS FOR OVER 4,000 YEARS? - Part 4 of 5 - Satanists make extensive use of special inserts in a person's body who is in witchcraft, or a person they wish to control. The Biblical Mark of the Beast would be a natural \"insert\" for the most powerful Satanist witch in world history to use to control the entire population of the world.Once you have read these previous articles, you will be ready to discuss the \"buying and selling\" nature of this M.M.E.A. Chip, so you can see how easily and quickly the entire economic world can be brought under the its enormous power. Let us review the prophecy:\"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\" [Rev 13:16-17]Thus, if this implantable chip is the one which Antichrist and his False Prophet will force upon the world in fulfillment of this above Scripture, the chip must be able to easily, quickly allow cashless purchases on the one hand, while being somehow unique to every person of earth -- all 6.6 billion of them. Most people believe that a chip must be made \"re-writable\" so that the data stored on it can be changed again and again, daily in some cases. Obviously, if that is true, this chip must be capable of storing an immense amount of data, so much data that it would be expensive to make, perhaps so expensive that the cost to produce a chip for every person on earth might be too high, even for the Illuminati.Another misconception is that each chip must be made at the factory with the name of the person in whom the chip is going to be ultimately inserted. If this were true, then the Illuminati could not begin production on 6.6 billion chips until the time to insert them was very close.Neither of these assumptions is correct, as we shall now demonstrate.SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY IN USE RIGHT NOW The technology this M.M.E.A. Chip uses to \"buy and sell\" is simple, and is being increasingly utilized right http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (2 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKnow! But, first, let us describe the three parts of this chip which will have to interact properly in order that countless \"buying and selling\" transactions can easily and seamlessly occur.In order for the M.M.E.A. to function properly (communicate sending and receiving) it must consist of three parts.PART #1 -- The Multiple Micro Electrode Array (M.M.E.A.) -- This would be the actual hardware interface between Flesh and Silicon. This is the device that looks like tiny needles [Picture shown in NEWS1875b], and it would be inserted into the Nerve or Brain, designed to detect or transmit the actual electrical signal. In simple terms it would be like an electric cable being plugged into the electric wall socket.PART #2 - This is the chip itself. This unit would be the processor designed to tell the Electrode what to do; it would also transmit what signals the electrodes detect. There have been several different tests conducted with the M.M.E.A. Some Tests have used Larger External (Outside the human body) Processor Chips while some have used the smaller Internal Processor Chips (Inside the human body) . The tests Professor Kevin Warwick have performed used the smaller Internal Chips. These chips are nothing really special, as they can be just like the GSM Chip in a Mobile phone. This chip tells the device what to do, plus retaining small amounts of information that would allow it to connect to a larger Network. The limited information contained on the chip is designed just to tell the Network who it is, receive more information that is specific for this device; then, the chip will trigger the Network computer to open its unique file and stand by for \"buying and selling\" or for updating information. This information is stored in the Network computer. If you were buying at K-Mart, your chip would simply transmit your unique 18-digit identifying number to K-Mart's computer, causing that computer to pull up your file to get ready to buy. If you were at your doctor's office, your chip would send your identifying number to the Network of which the doctor is a part and cause that computer to open your file to get ready to update information.These chips would most likely be mass produced as PROM or EPROM instead of ROM, as this technology would allow mass production without having to specifically build a chip for every person on the Planet at the factory. Once these chips were produced, they could be programmed specifically for each person at a later date when the individual has it inserted. The chip would contain information like Personal ID Codes which we have discussed before [NEWS1875]. This unique identifying code could include any type of ID Numbers, Medical Database Numbers, or Banking Numbers.Once again, we reiterate: once this chip has been programmed with your unique ID number, that number becomes the \"Golden Key\" that will unlock the network computer of every company with whom you want to do business. A person's every transaction will be updated by the network computer, not stored in their personal implantable chip! This fact is very important, so please meditate upon it until you thoroughly understand it.PART #3 -- would be the medium (how the two above devices would communicate with other devices or with a Network). The tests now being performed have used two methods: 1) Internal and External Wireless RF; plus 2) Wired. Professor Kevin Warwickâ€™s test was performed using an Internal Wireless RF Transmitter and Receiver. This technology allowed the above two devices to connect to a network for monitoring and interaction.BUYING, SELLING, AND PAYING WITH THIS TECHNOLOGYHow this would work with a paying system is very simple; it would be similar to the RF ID Payment systems now being used by many of the Credit card companies, mobile phone companies, and the Department Of Defense. These chips - the PART #2 above - would have a certain unique identifying code number http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (3 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKprogrammed into them, - a Social Security number, for example; this number would already be inside the Banking Systems Network, associated with your specific account. Then, when a person is ready to make a purchase at the store all he/she would have to do is hold their right hand up to the Cashier's R.F. receiver. The cashier would get the correct banking account information from the chip in the customer's hand, thus automatically pulling up your bank account on the Network. Almost instantly, the purchase would be deducted automatically from the customer's account.The process is all very simple, and very fast, AND it is already being done with RF credit cards and mobile phones. The principle is the same; the only difference is that this chip would be a device a customer could not lose or have stolen. To make this point even clearer, mobile phones were made to communicate just like the M.M.E.A.; however, they also have the ability to store personal information. A customer can now make purchases with nothing more than a mobile phone! This technology is not likely to be used only for payment transactions, nor is anyone going to receive their money directly in their hands. Always, someone is going to make a electronic transaction to the customer's bank account where their Virtual Money will be stored. This device will be a link between the customer and their numbered account; the same technology will also work with Medical / Military / Criminal / Work / Education Records.Now, let us examine some current news stories to see how this technology is being used right now, preparing the people to accept this type of transaction and getting the receivers thoroughly disseminated throughout our economy.NEWS BRIEF: \"R.F.I.D. in the U.S.A\", by Ivan Schneider, Bank Systems and Technology Online, September 1, 2003.\"Have you ever felt impatient when standing behind someone in line at the grocery store who insisted on paying by check? ... Contactless cards, already used in Asia for several transit and payment systems, have been introduced to the United States via pilot programs sponsored by American Express and MasterCard. These 'proximity payment' systems use Radio Frequency ID (RFID) technology that can essentially provide a consumer with a portable antenna that transmits an encrypted number when brought near a secure merchant terminal.\"As we stated, above, the M.M.E.A. contains a tiny antenna which, when prompted, sends out a person's unique identifying number to the antenna of the retailer. The two RFID systems then begin to communicate with each other. The purchase -- or the payment to be made -- is sent to the retailer's Network Computer after the unique identifying number of the customer has \"opened the file\" of that customer. If this is the first purchase by this customer at this retailer, a new file for that customer will quickly be created. Then, the transaction is sent from the retailer's \"secure merchant terminal\" to that retailer's master computer; within milliseconds, the transaction is recorded and that amount of money is deducted from the customer's bank account, while being systematically deposited in the retailer's bank account.Now, let us go back to our feature article for more pertinent information:Save Time, Spend More \"From the outset, industry participants have cooperated-at least as far as the merchant terminals are concerned. 'A merchant only wants to buy one reader,\" says David Bonalle, vice president and general manager of advanced payments development, American Express (New York). 'They don't want to have four different devices sitting on their counter' ... The results have demonstrated how accelerating the payment process can help merchants to cut costs and raise revenues. According to time-and-motion studies conducted by American http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (4 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKExpress, ExpressPay 'got people through the line 30 to 40 percent faster than with cash', said Bonalle. Furthermore, customers in the pilot spend an average of 20 to 30 percent more on their purchases...\" [Ibid.]Now, that kind of benefits delivered by this cashless electronic system is the type that will get the attention of retailers in a hurry! No wonder Wal-Mart is so determined to get this RFID system completely installed throughout their vast system! To keep up with the promised efficiencies RFID is going to deliver, and not wanting Wal-Mart to get yet another advantage over them, retailers of every stripe will quickly bring this system into their network. This competitive factor will cause RFID to speed through our economy in record time. Furthermore, every trucking company and every supplier of Wal-Mart and other retailers will quickly institute RFID. The economy of the entire world will soon be \"on line\".Let us again go back to our feature article:\"The ExpressPay device, available as either a key fob or as a standard card, comes with another interesting feature-no signature required. American Express limits its exposure with a \"daily spend limit\" of $150, usable only at selected point-of-sale locations. 'There is an opportunity to go into higher value purchases as long as you add additional authentication,' says Bonalle. 'Some combination of spend limits and PIN, we think makes a lot of sense. Ultimately, I could see an even higher level of security by using a biometric identification,' says Bill Allen, marketing communications manager for RFID Systems at Texas Instruments (Dallas).\" [Ibid.]The desire to secure this new type of purchasing system is paramount if customers all over the world are to be expected to enthusiastically embrace it. Thus, you can see American Express limiting daily purchases until it works out all the kinks in its security system. \"Additional authentication\" is definitely needed, and can be provided by spending limits and PIN numbers; however, the industry is definitely examining the use of \"biometric identification\", i.e., thumbprints, retinal scans. Of course, the ultimate way to \"secure\" this new system would be to implant the chip into the person's body, either in the forehead or in the right hand.When the implantable chip begins to communicate with the \"secure merchant terminal\", care must be taken that someone is not intercepting that data stream so they can use it to gain the unique customer number. The industry is working on that type of security, as well. \" ... the biggest source of fraud isn't illegitimate use of stolen cards - it's the illegitimate use of stolen card numbers. That's why implementations of RFID include a chip controller that secures the transmission of payment information. The industry standard ISO/IEC 14443 'secures the transmission of the data from the card to the reader, and from the reader to the card', says Allen. 'If someone intercepted the transmission of the data, they would have a very hard time cracking the algorithm. On top of that, each chip contained within the ExpressPay device performs a random number algorithm that sends an unique code-which changes for each transaction-through the merchant terminal to American Express' back-end systems for verification.\"As you can see, this RFID system has been carefully thought out, from beginning to end. With this kind of thorough and dedicated research by private industry, you can rest in the \"assurance\" that advance is going to be very, very rapid. Then, with the Federal Government financing the M.M.E.A. through Homeland Security's D.A.R.P.A., you can further rest assured that the implantable chip will be fully integratable into the RFID system; in fact, the M.M.E.A. will undoubtedly be trumpeted as the latest advance in the entire system, fully replacing all cards in use.With all the economic benefits provided by this system, what kind of unsaved person would NOT want to take that implantable chip?http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (5 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKHowever, the time the chip is given to all people throughout the world, it will be presented with a dual purpose; each person will be told that, when they take this M.M.E.A. Chip, they are pledging their loyalty and worship to the recently-risen Antichrist. Therein lies the eternally fatal trap of a chip like M.M.E.A. Every person who takes this M.M.E.A. given by the newly anointed \"Messiah\" will be cast into the Lake of Fire that burns forevermore. Listen to God's warning:\"THEN I heard a mighty voice from the temple sanctuary saying to the seven angels, Go and empty out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath and indignation. So the first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful ulcers (sores) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image.\" [Revelation 16:2; Parallel Bible, KJV/Amplified Bible Commentary]Therefore, when a person takes the M.M.E.A. Chip, they will soon receive \"foul and painful ulcers (sores)\" upon their bodies, most likely in the same location where they had taken the chip. However painful these sores are, they pale into insignificance compared to the pain God has planned eternally. Listen again:\"Then another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a mighty voice, Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [beast's] stamp (mark, inscription) to be put on his forehead or on his hand, He too shall have to drink of the wine of God's indignation and wrath, poured undiluted into the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no respite (no pause, no intermission, no rest, no peace) day or night--these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him.\" [Revelation 14:9-11; Ibid.]Note that taking this chip is a sin which cannot be forgiven! No one can take the mark, and then turn to God with tears pouring from a broken heart, asking forgiveness. When a person takes this chip, their eternal destiny in Hell is sealed. The Bible also does not ever, ever say that a person can take the Mark of the Beast and still go to Heaven. We shall be writing an article on this subject shortly, but for this article, suffice it to say that no one can ever take the Mark of the Beast and still go to Heaven, no matter the circumstance!God also promises His saints some very special reward when they refuse to take this chip, even though they know they are going to be beheaded immediately. \"... and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\" [Rev 20:4]These saints will be very specially rewarded for their martyrdom at the hands of the army of Antichrist because they refused the implantable chip.CONCLUSIONWe have demonstrated how easily and simply the M.M.E.A. Chip can be used to efficiently \"buy and sell\" in the global marketplace, just as the Bible prophecy of Revelation 13:16-18 demands. Furthermore, this is the chip the Federal Government is backing with significant dollars in order to finish the Research and http://cuttingedge.org/news/n1875e.cfm (6 of 8)12/15/2003 6:27:02 PM"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MMES - MULTIPLE MICRO ELECTRODE ARRAY I... SELLING IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINKDevelopment required to bring this technology to the entire world quickly.The Bible does not state when the Antichrist and False Prophet will force this implantable mark upon every person, but most scholars believe it will be near the mid-point of the Tribulation, at the 3 1/2 year point. Therefore, whenever Antichrist arises, his scientists will have at least 3 1/2 more years in which to perfect this product and make it accomplish what Satan needs it to accomplish.As you contemplate the awful nature of this technology, you can only come to the conclusion that the End of the Age is truly upon us.Are you spiritually ready? Is your family? Are you adequately protecting your loved ones? This is the reason for this ministry, to enable you to first understand the peril facing you, and then help you develop strategies to warn and protect your loved ones. Once you have been thoroughly trained, you can also use your knowledge as a means to open the door of discussion with an unsaved person. I have been able to use it many times, and have seen people come to Jesus Christ as a result. These perilous times are also a time when we can reach many souls for Jesus Christ, making an eternal difference.If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, but have been very lukewarm in your spiritual walk with Him, you need to immediately ask Him for forgiveness and for renewal. He will instantly forgive you, and fill your heart with the joy of the Holy Spirit. Then, you need to begin a daily walk of prayer and personal Bible Study.If you have never accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, but have come to realize His reality and the approaching End of the Age, and want to accept His FREE Gift of Eternal Life, you can also do so now, in the privacy of your home. Once you accept Him as Savior, you are spiritually Born Again, and are as assured of Heaven as if you were already there. Then, you can rest assured that the Kingdom of Antichrist will not touch you spiritually. If you would like to become Born Again, turn to our Salvation Page now. We hope you have been blessed by this ministry, which seeks to educate and warn people, so that they can see the coming New World Order -- Kingdom of Antichrist -- in their daily news. Finally, we would love to hear from you. You can contact us by mail or email. God bless you.
