[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman, author of The Committee of 300, tells how Mayer Amschel, the founder of the\"Red Shield\"dynasty acquired his first fortune. It is a far cry from the myths and legends that still surround the man who began as a rag and bone merchant and pawnbroker, working out of a small house on Judenstrasse, Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where he lived with his wife and family. The events attributed to history are often caused by a \"hidden hand\" pulling the strings of kings, princes and potentates from behind the scenes. The phenomena is explained and the legends that have grown up around the Rothschilds are demolished by this book that also reveals the Rothschild's intriguing that brought down men like Napoleon and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Legends has it that Mayer Amschel Rothschild's \"genius and financial skills\" were inherited by his sons, but the truth is quite a different story, as Dr. Coleman makes very clear in this well documented account that goes far beyond the best known legends cloaking the true character of the family. Exactly how Mayer Amschel Rothschild \"stuck it lucky\" and the steps he took that brought the family from obscurity to \"virtual rulers of all Europe,\" makes fascinating reading. This outstanding book is not only about the past, it is also about the present and the future. It will help to explain many of the events that perplex the ordinary people like the war in Iraq and the war threats against Iran."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Table of Contents FOREWORD ...............................................................................

Some might consider it effrontery to talk about the huge fortune that fell into the hands and the control of Mayer Amschel Rothschild as an \"opportunity,\" while others regard it as nothing less than misappropriation of funds entrusted to his care, hardly an \"opportunity\" in the generally accepted meaning of the word. Nevertheless, for Mayer Amschel it was a godsend that lifted him out of a life of pawn-broking and selling second-hand goods, to the highest echelons of power, a remarkable achievement when one considers the history of the period, in which Jews were constrained by many civil laws designed to act as a permanent barrier between them and the people of the principalities and nations in which they lived. Class distinction was another huge barrier, which would have been daunting for even a non-Jew who was not a part of the ruling aristocracy. Mobility of classes was unheard of and separation was harsh and strictly enforced, especially in Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, where the Rothschild dynasty began its remarkable history. Mayer Amschel Rothschild had little if any formal education; his family did not have a motto, but what he did have was tenacity of purpose and a strong belief in his religion. His was a bourgeois home, an \"alien\" home in the alien ghetto of Frankfurt. Through guile, and what some unkind critics called \"innate cunning,\" Mayer Amschel Rothschild reached right into the heady world of aristocratic families who shunned him, and who indeed, despised him. But for the \"good fortune\" (or \"misfortune\" â€” depending on which side one is on) of meeting"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"VIII Dr. John Coleman the Landgrave of Hesse, Mayer Amschel Rothschild would have remained an obscure pawnbroker and peddler of rags and bones for the rest of his life. It was not necessary for him to identify himself as a Jew, of which descent he was proud, nor did Mayer Amschel ever attempt to hide his origin. On the contrary, he was proud of it, even in the face of relentless opposition to the Jews of Frankfurt, which extended to all the nations of Europe. England, the most \"civilized\" of European nations as history will have us believe, was particularly fierce in its opposition to Jews. Even its leading figures, educated men, were not averse to referring to Jews in the most unflattering of terms. For instance, Lord Gladstone often referred to Disraeli, the \"valet\" of the Rothschilds, as \"that loathsome Jew\" according to Gladstone's biographer, Edward Freeman. Bishop Wilberforce called Disraeli \"an Eastern Jew\" in an unflattering manner. Bismarck called him \"the Hebrew conjurer\" and Carlyle labeled him as \"the absurd Jew boy.\" I mention these things as examples to show what tremendous odds were faced by Jews, even the educated among them who aspired to power in the business and financial world of the 18 th and 19 th centuries. Some historians and writers charge that the Rothschilds fabricated their history and their achievements to ascend to power. Their compelling presence has made a vast difference to history and it can be rightly proclaimed that no major event in the political and economic life of the nations of Europe did not somehow or somewhere involve the Rothschilds, even though deeply hidden and however indirect it may have been. In the minds of many, the Rothschilds will always be associated with immense wealth, but it is the power, brought by that wealth, which is not as well recognized as it ought to be. For the Rothschilds did not seek a vast fortune just to be able to live a life of ease. They sought wealth for what it would bring in the way of control of the leading power brokers of all nations, through whom they exercised control of nations, which extends even to this day. The Rothschilds did not live in a vacuum; rather they affected millions of lives. Lionel Rothschild liked to think of himself as unique, and perhaps this is true. It is true that like his brothers, he was uniquely rich, but how rich was never made"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty IX public. One thing is not true; the Rothschilds did not make a fortune out of inflation of the currency of the nations among whom they lived. There are no real benchmarks to guide us into the true character of the members of the Rothschild family and what drove them to an obsession with money and insatiable appetites for power. For the most part we are left to guess at what went on in the minds of this powerful family who were determined to become the hidden rulers of Europe and Great Britain, and indeed, the world. It was not that they were aided by good looks or a pleasing manner of speech like the natural attributes of the Irish race. On the contrary, they were by all accounts distinctly ugly in appearance and coarse in manner. Meyer Amschel spoke in guttural Frankfurt Yiddish, a mixture of Polish and German with expressions drawn from the Hebrew language. The education he gave his children did not extend beyond the rudimentary synagogue school they attended. Intellectualism was in any case prohibited to the Jews of Frankfurt who were not allowed to share in the Age of Enlightenment that swept Europe. Mayer Amschel remained true to the instructions of the Talmud and honored all of its traditions, instructing his children to do likewise. He in no way altered his life style once fame and fortune was his. The clothes he and his sons wore were often worn until threadbare. There are very unkind references to this fact in many of the papers and documents in the British Museum, some of them highly derogatory. It is alleged in one account by Cherep- Spiridovich that Mayer Amschel never changed his underwear and wore the same garments \"until they fell off him.\" Writers like John Reeves, Demachy and Spiridovich conclude, in the words of the latter, that to the \"political phases of this sinister and fatal family could be attributed at least one half of the all the bloodshed and calamities that have befallen the nations since 1770.\" Others, like the Editor of the Chicago Tribune who knew something was going on, but could not put names to it, wrote on July 22, 1922:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"X Dr. John Coleman Our statesmen are children compared with theirs. A foremost place in world affairs is offered us time and again. It is thrown into our laps, and through plain stupidity, we reject it. The question is: \"Did we reject it, or did some hidden force prevent us from seizing the initiative?\" Nietzsche, the German philosopher in his work The Dawn of Day wrote: One of the spectacles which the next century will invite us to witness is the decision regarding the fate of the Jews. It is quite obvious now that they have cast their die and crossed the Rubicon; the only thing that remains for them is to either become the masters of Europe or to lose Europe, as they once lost Egypt, where they were confronted by similar alternatives. . . Europe may some day fall into their hands like ripe fruit, if they do not clutch it too eagerly. Those who have researched Nietzsche say he was referring to the Rothschilds, but I could find no evidence to back up this claim, although it would seem to fit the pattern of that famous family. Many of their secrets remained totally hidden and may never be revealed. The frustration with such secrecy is revealed in the words of the French statesman, Lamartine: We wish to break every kind of yoke, yet there is one that is unseen, yet weighs on us. Whence comes it? Where is it? No one knows, or at least, no one tells. The association is secret even for us, the veterans of secret societies. The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, G. Hanotoux wrote in 1878 of this hidden hand as a \"mysterious force ruling politics and muddling the cards of diplomacy.\" Many of these mysteries were fully cleared up by Disraeli in his novel Coningsby, which was but a thinly veiled account of the doings of the Rothschilds.

Between Paris and Naples, Sidonia passed two years. It was impossible to penetrate him. His frankness was strictly limited to the surface. He observed everything, though over-cautious, but avoided serious discussion. He was a man without affection. Karl Rothschild lived in Naples, and Mayer Amschel lived in Frankfurt, so it does not take much to conclude, that \"Sidonia\" was Lionel Rothschild, and thus concluding, we obtain from Coningsby, one of the best and most accurate detailed accounts of the Rothschilds and their rise to power possibly ever written."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XII Dr. John Coleman The Rothschild Dynasty Note of Explanation Please note that sources and references are mentioned in the text.

There are many legends, myths and fanciful tales, but not much of the true character of this family, that changed the course of history who bought and sold statesman, kings, dukes and bishops, as if they were mere commodities, to be cast aside like worn out shoes and old clothes when they had served their purposes. The family is said to have caused revolutions, wars and upheavals that altered the face of Europe, the Far East and the United States, forever. The purpose of this book is to explore the Rothschild history and to come to grips with what their plan was for the world. The Rothschilds are Jews, a fact they never sought to conceal or downplay. Throughout history, from India to Babylon to Palestine in ancient times, money matters have always been principally the trade of the Jews. In the money markets of Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong, the Jewish financier predominated. By 1917 they were strung out across the world. On the stock exchanges of London, Paris and New York, Jewish brokers are the back bone of the business. The movement of precious metals, diamonds and currency throughout the world has always been under Jewish control. We recite these facts as facts in themselves and not to in any way infer anything derogatory. The Jews themselves admit to this. When preparations were being made by Britain to wage war against Germany in 1910, the international Jewish"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2 Dr. John Coleman financiers were stationed in key locations, -- and at the head of international financing around the world stood the Rothschilds and their associated banking houses. In France it was Rothschild, Fould, Camondo, Pereira and Bischoffheim; in Germany, Rothschild, Warschauer, Mendelssohn, Bleichroder; in England, Sassoon, Stern, Rothschild and Montague; ~ in the Far East it was Sassoon; in Russia it was Gunzburg; in the United States it was J.P. Morgan, Kuhn Loeb and Co., Seligman and Co., Speyer and Co., Warburg and Lazard Freres. Above all, dwarfing and overshadowing them was the House of Rothschild. Critics of the Rothschilds say that Morgan and Kuhn Loeb were merely fronts for the Rothschilds, and that all of the famous banking houses were affiliated with the Rothschild banks. These banking houses weathered many storms due to their cautious approach to speculation and their close brotherhood and kinship to the Rothschilds and each other. The founder of the House of Rothschild was Mayer Anselm Bauer (Rothschild), the son of Anselm Moses Bauer, a merchant of Frankfurt. The father sold new and used goods and old coins, and did pawn broking under the sign of a red shield, from which the name Rothschild, German language for red shield, evolved. Rothschild became their adopted and official family name. The business was located on Judenstrasse, quite literally \"Jew Street\" in a ghetto in Frankfurt, numbering about 550 families. Mayer Amschel (Rothschild) was born in 1743. The family had been in Frankfurt for generations, indeed there is a record in the British Museum that they dated back to the beginning of the 16 th century. By the 18 th century they were quite a large group. I identified twenty antecedents of Mayer Amschel, the eldest of three sons whose parents were in the business of dealing in money, both buying and selling, in which he assisted from the age of ten. The small business was really a"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 3 type of foreign money-exchange since at that time Germany consisted of 350 principalities, each with its own currency. Apparently they were forbidden to follow the professions open to all non-Jews in Frankfurt. There is no doubt that Jews were subject to all sorts of restrictions, some of which were rather unjust. The family home was a mock-Gothic wooden hut where Mayer Amschel lived with his mother and father and three brothers until 1775, when a massive epidemic of smallpox swept Europe, taking the lives of both of Mayer's parents. Mayer's relatives enrolled him in rabbinical school at Furth. But he did not have the patience or the liking for the long years of study needed to qualify, and after three years at Furth, at the age of thirteen, Mayer Amschel struck out on his own. One can only admire the courage it must have taken for one so young to take such a step. Proceeding to Hanover, the young man was given a small, insignificant \"charity\" job at the House of Oppenheimer's bank, where within six months of his arrival he was made an apprentice. It did not take him long to conclude that to succeed at banking, one needed the protection of one of the leading princes. After six years he left Hanover and went back to Frankfurt where he married Gudule Schnapper in 1770. Mayer and Gudule (Gutta) occupied the first floor above a shop from where Mayer bought and sold new and used goods, as his father had done before him. Many items, such as pictures and furniture, were displayed on the sidewalk. This was the home, the starting place of the \"barons of banking,\" who were to control the world's finances and great leaders, statesmen and kings. Gudule bore Mayer five sons. Discussions with his five sons were always around a \"dirty wooden table,\" a description given by Spiridovich in Unrevealed in History, where the family gathered for meals and talks. The distribution of the financial world among the sons was one of the favorite topics of discussion. Their father"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 Dr. John Coleman talked about the four grandsons of Charlemagne, how the Emperors of the Romans had ruled the world and his vision for his sons. His five daughters were never included in such talks. Charles the Great (Charlemagne) (771-814) was a typical German, over six feet tall and a superb athlete who spoke Greek and Latin. He was King of the Franks and became the Emperor of Rome from 800-814 BC. Yet in spite of his veneration of Charlemagne, Mayer Amschel swore a violent hatred for all things of \"Roma,\" which in later years he described as \"the great foe of Bolshevism,\" according to Sir Alfred Mond in World Battle of the Jews. Samuel Gompers, writing in The Chicago Tribune of May 1, 1922 said of Bolshevism, in reference to Mayer Amschel: Nothing would constitute a more needless and base betrayal of civilization than the recognition of the Bolshevik tyranny. The policy of the German and Anglo- American bankers is the most dangerous element in the whole chain of Bolshevik efforts. The Bolsheviks funds amounted to millions of dollars. The hatred displayed by Mayer might have sprung from the fact, that since 1762, Frankfurt on the Main had been the city of the election and coronations of the Holy Roman Emperors, something Mayer Amschel detested because he knew that the Catholic Church was an implacable enemy of the Bolsheviks. Some historians say that his hatred was directed to Russia, because it was the largest Christian nation in Europe and that under several of its rulers, Jews had endured many hardships and persecution. Around the table, Mayer would warn his sons to keep their wealth in the family and never marry outside of it. He explained the Hebrew law of \"neshek\" meaning literally, \"a bite,\" the word for interest and \"how it was to be applied outside of, and not to, the Hebrews.\" Secrecy was to be paramount; no one outside of the family was ever to know"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 5 how much money they had. According to author John Reeves who in his book, The Rothschilds: Financial Rulers of Nations, quotes MacGregor, author of The Kahbalaha Unmasked: The five sons started in business in five European capitals, but were acting in concert with each other. The business of the Rothschilds since 1812 has been so immense, and the bonds linking the different members of the family together interwoven, that to unravel them appears to be well nigh hopeless. The success achieved by the founder was due to the disturbed state of the world. Mayer Amschel was a child of fortune equally with Napoleon. Mayer Amschel had five sons and five daughters: Anselem Mayer, born 1773 married Eva Hannau Salomon Mayer, born 1774 married Caroline Stern Nathan Mayer, born 1777 married Hannah Levi Barnet Cohen 1806 Karl, born 1788 married Adelaide Herz Jacob (James), born 1792 married niece Betty, daughter of his brother Salomon, Anselem his oldest son, received the signal honor of becoming a member of the Royal Prussian Privy Council of Commerce, Bavarian Consul and Court banker.

Salomon Mayer was somehow able to force his way into the inner and most intimate circle of Prince Mettemich, the virtual ruler of Austria. The five daughters got no shares in the business nor did they have any say in the running of it, in fact, being totally excluded. Mostly, they married under \"arranged marriages.\" According to author John Reeves: The movements of the Rothschilds are carefully watched and are as important to the public as those of any Ministers. One enthusiastic enquirer was informed that it was impossible to name all the members of the family as a pedigree did not exist. (The Rothschild Financial Rulers) At his deathbed, Mayer Amschel read from the Talmud and then compelled his children to swear a solemn oath that they would always stick together and never undertake to do anything separately, this according to Major General Count Cherep- Spiridovich, The Unrevealed in History and papers in the British Museum in London."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 7 CHAPTER 2 MAYER AMSCHEL AND FIVE SONS MEET SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE While at the Oppenheimer Bank, Amschel had the singular good fortune to meet Lieutenant General Baron von Estorff, an aristocrat closest to the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassell, an extremely important family with an ancestry dating back hundreds of years. In The Rothschild Money Trust by Armstrong, it is stated that the Landgrave was William IX: \"He became a money lender and agent for William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.\" The much decorated historian, soldier and writer, Count Cherep-Spiridovich describes it merely as \"Amschel became the manager for the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.\" It is said that Mayer did some service for von Estorff at the expense of Oppenheim bank, the exact details of which are not known to this day. According to my research in the British Museum, the approach was first made through the financial adviser to Wilhelm, one Karl Budurus: \"Rothschild, similar in their ambitions, formidably tenacious, patient and secret, had a meeting of the minds and decided to enter into an arrangement of mutual assistances.\" The details of the scheme they worked out have never been revealed. However, the Jewish Encyclopedia of 1905 and 1909 Vo. X, page 499 throws some light on it: In a latter connection he (Amschel) became an agent for William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who, on"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 Dr. John Coleman his father's death inherited the largest private fortune in Europe (estimated at $40,000,000) derived mainly from the hire of troops to the British Government for putting down the revolution in the United States.. . After the battle in June 1806 the Landgrave fled to Denmark, leaving 600,000 pounds (about $3,000,000) with Mayer Rothschild for safekeeping. According to legend, this money was hidden away in wine casks, and escaped the search of Napoleon's soldiers when they entered Frankfurt, was restored intact to the electorate. The facts are less romantic and more business-like. The papers I examined show that the \"Elector,\" as he became known was none too scrupulous himself as to the origin of money that flowed into his coffers. Hessian mercenaries were his stock-in-trade, hired to those who had the most money to pay for them. The Hessians had developed their contract with the ruler, which made it clear that the Prince would receive a large down payment at the start of military operations for which they had been hired. Then, there was to be a supplementary payment to the soldiers, some extras for wounded and three times the amount if killed in battle. This was to go to the mercenaries or their dependants and not to the Prince. Moreover, the agreement-for- hire did not expire when peace was declared, but only one full year after the peace and only when the mercenaries had returned home. The British Government was the biggest customer, \"renting\" about 15,000-17,000 Hessians each year. Although there is no direct proof that Amschel and Budurus were the authors of the following scheme, it seems very likely that they were. Instead of the lump sum and payments being sent to Kassel, the home of the Prince, the money was retained in England where it was invested. The interest thereon"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 9 (negotiated by Amschel) was paid to the Landgrave in drafts. That portion of the money actually transferred to Kassel was then used to provide high interest loans to other needy princes. This resulted in a tremendous movement of funds in and out of Kassel with substantial income for the Landgrave, who had taken up with the Von Turn and Taxis family who held the postal monopoly for all of Europe. The mercenaries, who had done the most to earn the money, got nothing, but the bare promised amounts, as they were not privy to the \"private\" side-agreement done behind their backs. The Princes of Von Thurn and Taxis (members of the Committee of 300) were happy to have a share in the booty in exchange for acting as intelligence agents for the Landgrave, and later for the Rothschilds. They did this by opening important mail as directed, reading the contents and advising the Landgrave what they had seen, and on his orders, either expediting or delaying delivery of the letters to the benefit of the Landgrave and Mayer Amschel â€” and to the detriment of their debtors. (For further details of the Von Thurn and Taxis family, please refer to The Conspirators' Hierarchy, The Committee of 300, 4 th Edition) These facts are indeed far from the romantic notions of how Amschel got his start, and more fully disclosed than anything that has appeared in print before. Critics say that the facts are far from those suggested in the Encyclopedia. Cherep-Spiridovich says bluntly, that the money was not returned to the Landgrave and was in fact stolen by Amschel. In The Rothschild Money Trust, author Armstrong states: The facts are entirely 'less romantic.' Mayer Amschel Rothschild embezzled the money. This money was tainted from its origin.

It was first embezzled by William of Hesse and then by Mayer Amschel. This twice-stolen money is the foundation of the huge Rothschild fortune. It has ever since been true to its origin. There is not an honestly acquired dollar in the hundreds of billions now possessed by the Rothschild family. Instead of putting the money in wine casks, Mayer Amschel Rothschild sent the entire sum to his son Nathan in London, and where he established the London branch of the family. This was most probably the money used by Nathan to open N.M. Rothschild and Sons, the family banking house. Armstrong continued: For his extra-curricular services, Amschel was appointed as Imperial Agent of the Crown, a title that allowed him to travel freely without hindrances. His 'partnership' with the Princes of Von Thurn and Taxis brought valuable 'intelligence' information giving an edge on all moneylenders in competition with him. Nathan Rothschild invested it in 800,000,000 of gold (meaning worth that much and not by weight) from the East India Company, knowing that it would be needed for Wellington's peninsula campaign. He made no less than four profits: 1. On the sale of Wellington's paper which he bought for 50 cents on the dollar and collected at par. 2. On the sale of gold to Wellington."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 11 3. On its re-purchase. 4. On forwarding it to Portugal. This was the beginning of the great fortune. How a still relatively obscure bank clerk was able to cross the gulf of social barriers that separated their classes is a classic in its own right. According to documents in the British Museum: . . . The prince was very greedy and stingy, and did not care much concerning the means through which his fortune, left to him by his father, Wilhelm VIII (the brother of the King of Sweden) was increased. Frederic, hearing from von Estorff about the ability and unscrupulousness of Amschel, became interested in procuring a 'man of straw' (a front man) for his doubtful procurements. Amschel concealed his relationship with Frederic II behind a modest facade, but there is no doubt that he used his influence with the old Landgrave to gain millions as well as political advancement. He became the agent for the Landgrave of Hesse and the first government loan he arranged was in 1802, when the Danish government borrowed ten million thalers. Although it was not known at the time, the money came from the vast fortune of the Landgrave family. To curry favor, Amschel said he would give his share of the profits to Frederic II, but never did so. From this deal, the destiny of the Rothschilds was set to become one of the most astonishing success stories in the history of financing and loans. Frederick II was succeeded by this son, Wilhelm IX, who became Elector Wilhelm I in 1785. At this time Amschel had been something of a \"Minister of Finance\" to the deceased Frederick II and knew every one of the family secrets."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 Dr. John Coleman The two hit it of at once. Both were born in 1743. Amschel kept his true wealth from Elector Wilhelm I, always wearing the same clothes and pretending to be poor. From the time he became the manager of the fortune of Elector Wilhelm I, Amschel's fortune increased as his employer's decreased. In 1794 there occurred an event that caused Elector Wilhelm I to flee. It happened when the French General Hoche captured Coblenz. Fearing that his corrupt practices would be revealed (actually the schemes of Amschel the \"front man\") by the occupation, Elector Wilhelm I fled, having signed over control to Amschel. This is the true account of how the Rothschilds got their money. It was not by pawn brokering, smart speculation or any other of the widely accepted fairy tales that sound so romantic. The genius of the sons can be traced to the fortune of the Landgrave of Hesse and not to the fanciful \"genius\" of the five brothers! It was a case of \"theft by conversion,\" plain and simple. Mayer died at Frankfurt on December 12, 1812, leaving his legacy to five sons and a lesser amount for his five daughters."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 13 CHAPTER 3 THE ROTHSCHILDS GAIN ENTRY INTO EUROPE'S HIGH SOCIETY The manner in which Mayer left the bulk of his money to his five sons and much less to his daughters, was the hallmark of how he and his forbears regarded women as the weak link in the chain. Females were to be used for arranged marriages inside the family, for business. In other words, marriages were to be arranged with an eye to business advantages. There was no thought of \"equality\" of male and female in Mayer's mind. The modern-day, Socialist-led drive for equal rights for women was something that arrived more than one hundred years later, and was largely confined to equal rights for non-Jewish women. Amschel parceled out the nations of Europe like loaves of bread, allocating his sons Germany, Austria, Britain, Italy and France as \"their territories.\" Later he sent one of his family relatives, a man by the name of Schoeneberg to the United States under the assumed name August Belmont. He became the hidden hand that secretly pushed through legislation to enable the Federal Reserve to become law. The interests of the Rothschild sons became international finance and banking and they established branch offices in the major capitals of Europe, Paris, Naples, Vienna and London, each under close supervision of one of the five sons, while \"Belmont\" became heavily engaged in banking"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"14 Dr. John Coleman and Democrat Party politics in America. In a relatively short period of time the Rothschilds were able to bring all of Europe into their orbit and under their influence. They bought officials and made friends with the monarchs and princes of Europe, all the while ensuring that no outsiders came into the family. When one of the daughters began a \"love relationship,\" it was ruthlessly crushed. She was told that the brothers regarded marriage as a business affair and that they would arrange marriages for partnerships. It took only a generation of planning, intriguing and manipulation of public opinion to make the Rothschilds the greatest force and influence, not in only the affairs of Europe, but also in the Far East and later the United States. Intermarriages welded the family into a cohesive, solid front. By 1815, Austria led the way by granting the five brothers hereditary titles, \"baron\" with land ownership to go with it. Their meteoric rise to fame, fortune and power was astonishing to behold. They never made any decision or moves without close consultation with their \"communication agent\" and \"inside information source,\" the Von Thurn and Taxis. If positions of political power could not be realized, they were bought. Mayer Amschel in charge of Frankfurt, for instance, bought a seat on the Prussian Privy Council of Commerce. This was a position that in the past was open only to royalty, and his success shook the Prussian aristocracy, causing much alarm and consternation. Following the restoration of the Bourbons (in which the Rothschilds played no small part), the youngest of the brothers, James (Jacob) was given a charter to establish a branch of the Rothschild bank in Paris. Quick to realize the importance of railroads, James financed many of the new lines and made a huge fortune. He lent the Bourbons, always profligate spenders, millions of francs. Nathan was the genius of the five brothers. Third in line he was the one the others turned to for guidance. When"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 15 the brothers decided to establish themselves in England, they sent Nathan to settle in Manchester, a grimy northern industrial town, rather than in London. The reason was that the Rothschilds had important commercial plans for the cloth trade there, which they intended to exploit to the full before moving their operation to London. Most of the fabric needed to make uniforms for the British Army and Navy originally came from Germany. Thanks to the \"postal intelligence\" provided by the Von Thurn and Taxis mail monopoly, the Rothschilds learned that war with Napoleon was imminent. Nathan was quickly dispatched to Germany to buy up all stocks of such cloth. When the Manchester manufactures were given contracts by the British Government to make uniforms for the army and navy, they sent their agents to Germany to secure the necessary fabric stocks, as they had always done, only to learn that all production had already been sold to Nathan Rothschild, from whom they were now obliged to buy. When the news reached Manchester, there followed violent uproar. At one stage Nathan feared for his safety. After five years in Manchester, in 1805 Nathan moved to London. Actually, \"fled\" would be a better description as indeed he was forced to do when public wrath against his dealings began to mount. One of the principle reasons for Nathan's great success was that he realized that fast communication was the key to beating out competitors. He employed the fastest riders, ships and even carrier pigeons to communicate. He avidly sought \"inside information,\" which he kept from his competitors and from governments. He had his secret agents in all of the capital cities of Europe. This loyal group never hesitated to ride through the night, winter and summer. They kept the best breed of carrier pigeons and sailed on the fastest packet boats, sometimes buying all passages between France and England to block competitors."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"16 Dr. John Coleman Nathan's greatest principle of expertise was of buying government bonds that were defaulted, or about to be defaulted, at huge discounts. After a suitable time, great pressure was exerted on the governments concerned to redeem the bonds at face value, netting Nathan incredible profits. In this way he became the financial agent for more than half the governments of Europe. Some very notable people in the past declared that \"civilization came to an end in 1790,\" among them H.G. Wells, the famous British establishment writer who said in the New York American, (July 27, 1924) that the mental and moral progress of the human race ended with the 18 th century. Wells was well thought of by the Rothschilds, who liked his idea of the League of Nations, what Wells called \"a world state,\" which he said was inevitable. The Erlangers donated $3,000 to this purpose, as did N.M. Rothschild. George Bernard Shaw, the Irish playwright, told Hillaire Belloc: \"Something enormous happened in 1790.\" This was reported in the New York Times: There is reason to believe that they were referring to the great revolutionary movements that began between the middle and the end of the 18 th century when in 1779 Amschel Rothschild became the master of the richest man on Earth, the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 17 CHAPTER 4 THE WALLS OFJERICO [FRANKFURT] COME TUMBLING DOWN Earlier I referred to the fact that only five hundred Jewish families were allowed to live in Frankfurt Germany. The manner in which Mayer Amschel handled the problem was to become his trademark. On the birth of Napoleon's son, Grand Duke Dalberg of Frankfurt wanted to go to Paris and pay his respects, but none of the banks would lend him the money to make the trip. Old Amschel however, saw the possibilities of putting Dalberg in his debt, and lent him eighty thousand gulden at five percent. No pressure was put on the Grand Duke to repay the loan as long as the interest was paid, but at the same time, there was no favor asked by the Rothschilds that the Grand Duke could or did refuse. Amschel and his family were engaged in extensive smuggling operations in defiance of the French boycott of England out of which the Rothschilds made a great deal of money. Suspicion fell on Amschel, and a raid was set for May 1809. Dalberg, who never missed a chance to borrow money from Amschel at lenient rates, tipped him off about the pending raid through his executive Commissioner of Police, von Eitzlein. Frantic activity placed contraband and incriminating documents with reliable friends, so that when"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18 Dr. John Coleman Inspector Savagner and his men arrived they found old Mayer Amschel in bed, and a search failed to turn up anything incriminating. Although Napoleon's Trade Boycott inspectors had come up empty-handed, Amschel was nevertheless still fined 20,000 francs, a mere pittance, but he escaped going to prison, which would have happened had the contraband been discovered by the inspectors. When the fuss had died down, Amschel tackled the problem of restrictions on the number of Jewish families allowed to reside in Frankfurt. He approached Dalberg, who still owed him the principle sum of the loan. By law, each Jewish family had to pay an annual fee of 22,000 gulden to remain in the city. Amschel and one of his partners, a certain Gumprecht, persuaded the Grand Duke to accept one lump sum that would give the Jews citizenship rights in Frankfurt, the very thing so strongly opposed by the Christian majority. More than that, Amschel demanded not only equal citizenship, but in addition, the Jews would be allowed to establish their own ruling bodies and councils. The greedy Dalberg demanded that the lump sum proposed by Amschel be twenty times the total annual fee. Amschel and his friends met the demand with 294,000 gulden in cash and the balance in bearer debentures. In a letter to the Grand Duke confirming the arrangement and terms, Amschel showed that when humble obsequious behavior was necessary he was a master of the art: If I could be the messenger of the good news, as soon as it has been signed by His Royal Highness our most excellent Lord and Great Duke, in favor, and that I can inform my nation of their great joy, you will graciously inform me of it through the post, confess I abuse your goodness and grace, but I do not doubt that your Highness and your honored family have to await great heavenly rewards and will receive much happiness and blessing because in truth our whole"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 19 Jewry, if they have the happiness to obtain equal rights will gladly pay with great pleasures all dues the citizens have to pay. Note how Amschel boldly asserted that the Jews of Frankfurt were a separate nation. The agreement was some time in getting passed, but when it did, Amschel immediately announced the establishment of the Governing Body of the Israelite Religions Community with von Eitzlein (a Jew) the first president, perhaps rewarded for tipping Amschel to the planned raid for contraband in May 1809. The Senate and the Christians were furious and immediately attacked the agreement as giving special privileges to the Jews. Rumors flew thick and fast that Dalberg had received a substantial payment, which he had not made public. Feeling against Dalberg and the Jews reached fever pitch. Accusations of bribery for exchange for equal rights filled the air. With the fall of Napoleon, Dalberg was deposed and replaced by Baron von Hugel of the Hessians. Amschel was not afraid of Austria or Prussia, he had their governments in the palm of his hand, but he feared that when the Congress of Vienna decided the status of Frankfurt in 1814, the Dalberg agreement would not be honored. He sent Jacob Baruch and a certain Gompers as his representatives, but the Vienna police had them under surveillance as revolutionaries and ordered them to be expelled. However, Prince Metternich, who had been created by Nathan Rothschild, just as Adam Weishaupt, Napoleon, Disraeli and Bismarck were all mere puppet-creations (or \"valets\") of the Rothschilds, cancelled the order. Bribery and corruption were quite openly practiced. Humbold was offered three beautiful emerald rings worth a fortune, plus four thousand ducats, which he refused.

This nation, which never amalgamates with any other, but always hangs together to pursue its own ends will soon overshadow Christian firms; and with their terribly rapid increase in population they will soon spread over the whole city, so that a Jewish trading city will gradually arise beside our venerable cathedral. I spent considerable time researching documents in the British Museum, which in any way referred to the family in order to qualify to write about the rise of the Rothschild dynasty, much of what came from that source. Baron James became a great personality. Kings and ministers were obliged to reckon with him and he justified this by financing a loan of 520 million francs to the Government of the Restoration, which needed the money after the great wars of the Revolution and of the Empire.

James Rothschild paid for each government bond of 100 francs only 50 francs and received five francs as interest, which made ten percent on the money, loaned and the following year the principle began to return twofold. James became the lender of Kings. This added to his speculation on the Exchange where he was able to influence the rise and fall of stocks swelled the baron's earnings into millions. Between 1815 and 1830, the Rothschilds were simply plundering the five great powers; England, Russia, France, Austria and Prussia. Thus Prussia contracted a 5% loan of 5,000,000 pounds sterling, but received for its government bonds only 3,500,000 or 70%, making the actual interest rate over 7%. But the chief point of it was that the bonds had to be redeemed in a few years at 100%. The Rothschilds made a profit of 1,500,000 pounds sterling, plus the interest. In 1823 James took up the whole of the French loan. According to Professor Werner Sombart in his work The Jews and Modern Capitalism: The period of 1820 onwards became the age of the Rothschilds, so that by the middle of the century it was common dictum, there is only one power in Europe, and that is the Rothschilds. As previously explained, the work of fiction, Coningsby, by Disraeli was a thinly disguised account of the life of Nathan Rothschild II, and extremely revealing:"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 23 His father [Nathan Rothschild] had established a brother in most of the principal capitals. Here he was lord and master of the money markets of the world, and, of course, virtually lord and master of everything else. He literally held the revenues of Southern Italy in pawn [through Karl Rothschild in Naples] and monarchs and ministers of all countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions. Between Paris and Naples, Sidonia [Lionel] passed two years. Sidonia has no heart; he is a man without affections. This was the work dictated to Disraeli by Nathan Rothschild and put out as fiction, but there is no history of the Rothschilds more accurate than this. Who was Disraeli? In La Vielle France N-216, Bismarck said that Disraeli was a mere tool of the Rothschilds and that it was Disraeli and the Rothschilds who formulated the plan to dismember the United States through a massive Civil War. Disraeli was only one of their creations whom they brought from obscurity to fame. His grandfather, Benjamin D'Israeli, arrived in England in 1748. His son, Isaac D'Israeli was born in 1766 and soon became a Bolshevik. One of his works was called Against Commerce. Of his father Disraeli said: He lived with learned men. The learned men were Nathan Rothschild and his circle. Incidentally, \"El-Israeli\" (D'israeli?) is an Arabic name of Turkish origin used in the Middle East to denote people of Jewish descent. It is likely that his father's family came from Turkey to Italy and most likely, settled in Ancona or Cento. Isaac's field was writing and like many a researcher before him, he frequented the British Museum. He was also an importer of straw hats, marble and alum, but Isaac longed to write. In 1788 his father sent him to study in France, Italy and Germany. He returned to England in 1789 and wrote The"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 Dr. John Coleman Curiosities of Literature, which was published by the Socialist, John Murray. A literary success, it ran to thirteen editions. Benjamin probably inherited his writing skills from his father. Born in 1804 into a family of moderate means, Benjamin was circumcised on the eighth day according to the Jewish custom, and grew up in the Jewish faith. Although proud of it, we are led to believe that he knew at an early age that as far as public office, his \"Jewishness\" would be a drawback because in England at that time, Jews were barred by religion from becoming members of any political party. But on the orders of Nathan Rothschild, at the age of thirteen Benjamin was baptized on July 31, 1817 as a Christian so that he might penetrate English society and the political establishment, which at the time was closed to Jews by the Test Acts. His orders from Nathan Rothschild were to break down every barrier against the Jews. At one time he told Lord Melbourne, the Home Secretary: \"I am going to be the Prime Minister of England,\" which Melbourne thought fanciful and impossible. Of course Melbourne did not know at that time about Disraeli's \"Rothschild\" connection. But first, the necessary financing had to come from somewhere. At twenty-two he began \"speculating\" on the Stock Market, a highly unlikely occupation for a man who was always without any money. A certain Thomas Jones â€” more than likely an assumed name - came up with two thousand pounds to start with, increasing to nine thousand pounds â€” a huge sum of money at the time to invest in a penniless writer of no experience! It does not take much imagination to come to the conclusion that \"Thomas Jones\" was Nathan Rothschild. As was the case with the biographers of Napoleon I, Bismarck, Mettemich, Marshal Soult (who betrayed Napoleon at Waterloo), Karl Marx, Bombelles, Lassalle, Hertz, Kerensky and Trotsky praise for Disraeli, a former non-entity, was lavish. J.G. Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law, was beside himself when in 1825 he wrote:"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 25 I may frankly say that I never met a young man with greater promise.

Another bedazzled friend wrote: He had no rank, no important friends, no wealth, but he was an able scholar who dazzled the establishment with his audacity of conception, brilliant triumphs. He had that supreme confidence in himself, which amounts to virtual genius. He never showed discouragement. Of course! Backed by Nathan Rothschild he had the world at his feet. If only history could be rewritten! The English aristocracy was not destroyed by the \"French\" Revolution and they remained implacably opposed to the Jews until Disraeli on behalf of the Rothschilds, defeated them. Disraeli was the Trojan Horse, slipped into the very heart of English society and its political establishment. (Count Cherep-Spiridovich and British Museum papers) In December 1922, the British Guardian published an article by Dr. John Clarke, which is worth quoting: And how this potent firm [the Rothschilds] governs the Government of France and England alike may be gathered from two recent incidents.

And now the hidden mentors of Bonar Law's [the British Prime Minister who promised to follow the policies of Disraeli] new 'Conservative' Government induced him to send as Ambassador to Paris a non-diplomatic 'Liberal,' the Marquise of Crewe, whose wife is the daughter of Hannah Rothschild, Countess of Roseberry. Here we have the actual basis of the Franco- British Entente â€” 'R.F.' meaning Rothschild Freres, the Rothschild brothers, covers the British Empire, the French Republic and most of the other republics and kingdoms between Moscow, Angora and Washington. Who opened the way for such astonishing changes in the English political scene? It was Disraeli, who \"controlled\" Prime Minister Bonar Law. In the Life of Disraeli by Buckle, the author gives no hint of who made Disraeli: \"No career in English history is more marvelous than that of Disraeli, and none has hitherto been enshrouded in greater mystery.\" Actually, there was no \"mystery\" at all. But for Nathan and his son Lionel Rothschild, Disraeli would have never existed outside of his small, narrow family circle. From 1832 to 1837 Disraeli was in deep trouble over unpaid debts. In April of 1835, he was forced to spend a great deal of his time indoors to \"prevent being nabbed by the creditors,\" as he wrote in a letter to Lady Henrietta Sykes, his mistress. In August 1835, Disraeli went to Bradenham, there to escape his creditors. One of them was a certain Austen who was threatening to have him arrested and sent to a debtor's prison. At Bradenham, he tried to write his novel Henrietta Temple. At this period, his debts were overshadowing his writing. In July, another of his creditors, a Thomas Mash who had been pressing for payment, now grew strident and Disraeli walked in fear (when he did venture outside) of imminent arrest."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 27 Perpetually in deep financial trouble, deeply in debt at the age of twenty and unsuccessful in getting a seat in the House of Commons, which he had tried from 1832 to 1837 to accomplish, the Rothschilds, who had been watching him since the age of ten, made him their \"valet.\" In writing to his sister Sarah in 1849, Benjamin admitted as much. The year was the worst financial period in his life. He was being harried by his creditors and had to appear before an Assize Court when as he said in his letter to Sarah \"Mayer Rothschild unintentionally let the cat out of the bag.\" Disraeli did not \"raise England to the highest position\" as claimed by Buckle. Instead, what he did was to prepare England for a series of disastrous wars. He frightened generations of Englishmen with his lies about a \"great Russia\" being a danger and a threat for Great Britain. Prime Minister Gladstone accused Disraeli of lying. Was he sincere about the alleged Russian \"danger?\" Lord Gladstone said there were only two things he was \"in earnest about, his wife and his race.\" Gladstone evidently didn't know that Benjamin was \"in earnest\" about the Rothschilds of whom he seldom talked, perhaps because of the fact that nobody, no matter what their rank, could cross the Rothschilds with impunity. Benjamin Disraeli was the man of the hour for the Rothschilds; Lionel, Mayer, Anthony and their families, including the Montefiores. In a letter to his sister Sarah, he wrote, that after his honeymoon, there had been a party at the home of Mrs. Montefiore and there was \"not a Christian name there.\" No doubt Benjamin performed yeoman service for his mentors, providing them with \"intelligence\" from his high office. It is known that it was one such \"spy job\" that allowed the Rothschilds to float the lucrative Suez Canal loan. Described as a \"coup\" engineered by Disraeli, the facts are not quite that simple.

Disraeli immediately rushed to Baron Lionel de Rothschild who agreed to float a loan for the British Government for this purpose. The secret plan was hatched by Lionel and Disraeli and was presented to the British Cabinet for acceptance on November 24 th . The skill of Lionel in moving so fast was not mentioned, and so, in the eyes of the public, it remained a \"Disraeli coup.\" This account taken from the collected works of Major- General Count Cherep-Spiridovich goes a long way to dispelling the myths and legends that sprang up around the life and times of Nathan Rothschild, his extended blood relatives and their families, who lived in London, and the legendary DTsraeli."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 29 CHAPTER 6 BENJAMIN DISRAELI: MASTERSPY FOR THE ROTHSCHILDS It was a two-way street; with the Rothschilds always ready to bail Benjamin out of financial trouble, particularly in 1835, 1849, 1857 and 1862 when his debts amounted to what today would have been about $300,000 without means of payment. With his enemy, the Duke of Portland hounding him, he was \"loaned the money\" by a front man for Baron de Rothschild, one Philip Rose, who just happened to be staying at the same resort and spa hotel in Torquay at the same time as the Baron Rothschild. We are led to believe, that Rose persuaded Rothschild to loan the money Disraeli needed. Situated on the East Coast of England, Torquay was a fashionable resort town, boasting fine hotels and spas, often patronized by royalty and its hangers on. In a letter to his sister in December of that year, Benjamin wrote: He likes to give to his friends, not to lend, as he never takes interest from me. ..

Of course they have the propaganda explanations which satisfy most, but to the thinker, it has never been enough just talk about \"patriotism,\" \"love of country,\" \"making the world safe for democracy\" and fighting a \"war to end all wars.\" I cannot go too far back in history, so let us begin with some of the most explosive upheavals to hit the world beginning with the 18 th century and the personalities involved and then continue through to the 20 th century. Limitations of space restrict to the more salient features of these events. Although there is no hard evidence that the Rothschilds were involved in the cataclysmic \"French\" Revolution, historians tend to believe that they were behind it, acting through some of their agents. Their well-known hatred of Christianity and their desire to rid France of the Christian monarchy that it represented was the driving force behind the revolution. Opposition to Christianity was the factor believed to have motivated the Rothschilds to take indirect action to confront it at every opportunity. One thing has emerged clearly from the past; every war fought since then has been for the advancement of International Socialism, of which the Rothschilds were avid supporters. It is stated in papers in the British Museum that the Rothschilds were deeply involved in all revolts and wars since 1770. Indirectly, there is evidence that a branch of the Rothschilds was involved in financing the French Revolution through the bank of Moses Mocatta, uncle of Sir Moses Montefiore, whose brother, Abraham Montefiore, was married to Jeanette, the daughter of Mayer Amschel. Mayer Amschel's son, Nathan, married the sister-in-law of Sir Moses Montefiore in 1806. Another daughter of Abraham Montefiore, Louisa, married Sir Anthony Rothschild in 1840. History records the Jewish banking houses of Daniel Itzig, David Friedlander, Herz Geribeer and Benjamin and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 31 Abraham Goldsmidt, were the principal financiers of the \"French\" Revolution. It is interesting to note of the fifty-eight marriages contracted by the descendants of Mayer Amschel; twenty-nine and a half were between first cousins. From 1848 onward, the pace quickened. Marx established that all wars must be for the advancement of International Socialism and Lenin and Trotsky enshrined it in the Communist doctrine. The First World War was fought to establish Bolshevism in Russia; to establish a \"home for the Jews in Palestine,\" to destroy the Catholic Church and dismember Europe. The first attempt at One World Government was launched in the disguise of the League of Nations. The Second World War was fought to destroy Japan and Germany, to establish the USSR as a Communist world power and extend the reach of Bolshevism over three quarters of the world. In the aftermath the United States was gulled into joining the next attempt at One World Government, the United Nations. The Second World War changed the make-up of the United States, which was forced by its large contingent of International Socialists in positions of power to wean itself from its Constitution and its Republican form of government, and take on the role of the world's new Roman Empire. In short, the United States was turned from its Christian Republican form of government into an imperial power to conquer the world for and on behalf of International Socialism. Behind these powerful changes stood the power, the money and the guiding hand of the Rothschilds. I shall attempt to make way through the major events that triggered these and other wars.

They had freedom to work and freedom of the press according to the book by Louis Diste, Freemasonry and Terror, which he"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 Dr. John Coleman says is proved in the archives prior to August 10, 1789 -- everything that the French people wanted in the way of liberty, freedom from excess taxes and freedom of religion had all been granted.

Each time such a system of government was established â€” these evil, secret rulers came along and overturned those benevolent governments by means of extreme violence and extreme cruelty. An example is Russia, where Tsar Alexander II had agreed to a new constitution. His minister, Stolypin, had set the machinery in motion to grant lands to peasants and to nationalize banks; Nicholas had forbidden wars by his threat to \"fire on the first who fires\" and the Tsars were known as the most cultured, learned and gracious people in the world. Stolypin was cruelly murdered by Bolshevik revolutionaries to prevent the freedoms and reforms promised by the Tsar from being put into practice. On August 4, 1789, eighty three unknown men, shouting \"we are the 300,\" (thereby inadvertently exposing the hidden hand of their controllers) seized the City Hall in Paris. The City Hall in France is typically the center of the civil administration. Robespierre and Danton did not immediately join the blood lust that followed.

Philip Francis, writing in the New York American under the title The Poison in America's Cup stated: Nominally we govern ourselves; actually we are governed by an oligarchy of the American branch of The International Banker's Federation, Plunderbund. The British Government is the camouflage behind which the money kings of the world have hitherto hid their economic warfare upon the masses of the people. There is no direct proof that the Rothschilds were implicated in bringing on the French Revolution to happen, but there is ample evidence that Mirabeau was a member of the Les Amis Reunis as was his partner, Talleyrand. Mirabeau and Talleyrand discovered Napoleon, an obscure army officer. It is believed that many of the details of the French Revolution were discussed at the palace of the Landgrave of Hesse at Wilhelmsbad where it is known the leading Freemasons often gathered, which is the connection with Mayer Amschel, who headed \"the deadly secret conclave beyond the masons and unknown to them\" where the \"French\" Revolution was plotted.

It was the final act that freed the Jews from their political and civil disabilities in France. Unfortunately for history, The Rothschild Money Trust does not provide sources that could support the claim that the French Revolution was financed by the Rothschilds. In 1782 after \"acquiring\" the huge fortune of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, Amschel sent for Weishaupt who at the time was living the life of a beggar. Weishaupt was a man of low degree then struggling to find money to pay for an illegal abortion that had been performed on his sister-in-law. After his interview with Amschel, Weishaupt appeared in Paris with millions of francs at his disposal. He \"imported\" at least 30,000 criminals of the worst type and set them up in dens in Paris. He did the same thing in Germany. When all preparations were completed and the stage was set in 1789, all hell broke loose in Paris.

Japan does not want war. Certainly America does not want war. Why then, this perennial clamor that Japan is an enemy to be watched, distrusted, armed against, and finally fought? Of all of the historical figures in the past three centuries, none is better known than Napoleon. Yet not much is ever said about how he rose from obscurity to fame. Like most of those \"adopted\" by the Rothschilds, Napoleon was dirt poor when Talleyrand introduced him to the Rothschilds. He did not have the money to pay the laundry shop bill, and had only one shirt. His uniform had been supplied by Josephine Beauharnais, whom he later married after Count Paul de Barras had cast her off as his mistress. In 1786 Napoleon was a sub-lieutenant, a poor very junior officer without any money, going from door-to-door seeking employment to supplement his pay. It was a time when the people of Europe had grown tired of \"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.\" Amschel was disappointed that Weishaupt had made little progress against the Church, particularly, the Catholic Church, and was seeking \"new talent.\" The fire and ardor of the Corsican impressed Amschel enough to set him up with sufficient money to live decently. H. Fischer, in an article seen in the British Museum wrote: \"In 1790 Napoleon succeeded by means, even then judged to be unscrupulous in securing his election as second in command of a whole battalion. \" How did he do it? Charles MacFarlane, in his work The Life of Napoleon (it used to be in the British Museum where I read it) threw some light on this \"astonishing climb to power:\" Augustine Robespierre, the younger brother of the terrible Dictator, had become acquainted with"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 39 Bonaparte at the taking of Toulon in 1798. The fact is indisputable that he contracted an intimacy, having all the appearances of warm friendship with Augustine, who was to be fully as pitiless as his elder brother. According to the autobiography of Wolf Tone (Barry 1893) Robespierre was an Illuminist. A nominal Christian, Napoleon soon sensed the hatred for Christianity that burned in the breast of Amschel, and so he resorted to simulation to please his new money supplier. He turned against the Catholic Church. The humiliation of the Pope was a very pleasing prospect to Amschel, and money began to flow into Napoleon's pockets in ever-increasing amounts. Thus is his \"stunning rise to power,\" his \"astonishing successes\" explained! As we say in modern parlance, the writers and biographers of Napoleon failed to follow the money trail. The failure of Weishaupt to destroy the Catholic Church, the purpose for which he was \"constructed\" by Amschel was galling, but when Napoleon was brought to his attention, the whole work was shifted to him. The way it was to be accomplished was planned in the Mason lodges in Paris frequented by Talleyrand and in Frankfurt by Amschel. It was Talleyrand who told Napoleon: War is the only way you can destroy the Church. This was acknowledged by H.G. Wells who called the Corsican genius \"a wrecker, (of the revolution) hard, competent, capable, possessing initiative,\" but he failed to mention his financial backer, without whose masses of money, these traits of character would not have availed him much. Like Kerensky, Trotsky, Disraeli, Lloyd George and Bismarck, Amschel took over Napoleon when he was of no importance, and made of him, the most important man in Europe. Although H.G. Wells complained that he did not"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"40 Dr. John Coleman continue the revolution, this was not the point. When Amschel had Napoleon appointed the First Consul for life by a large margin of votes, the stage was set to ring up the curtain on Europe. As long as he carried out the mission set for him by Amschel, the destruction of the Christian Monarchies and of the Catholic Church, Napoleon bore a charmed life, going from one success to another. A good book I found in the British Museum was by Sidney Dark in which he wrote, How Great Was Napoleon: Napoleon, born without any advantage of wealth or high descent, made himself master of the world before he was 35 and finished his career of unparalleled romantic impossibility when he was 46. This completely overlooks the powers behind Napoleon, Amschel and his millions and the planners inside the Mason lodges of Paris and Frankfurt. On March 9, 1796, Napoleon married Josephina de Beauharnais, a Creole woman with insatiable sexual appetites who had once paid for his uniform. The marriage was arranged by the Rothschilds through Count Paul de Barras who also appointed Napoleon Commander in Chief of the Army in Italy. Josephina was the mistress of de Barras, but tiring of her, he sought to end the relationship, and to avoid her oath to take revenge on him, Count de Barras arranged for her to marry Napoleon, hardly the \"romantic\" spin put on the occasion by practically every writer on the life and times of Napoleon. Josephine helped de Barras by giving him confidential details imparted to her by her husband, which of course went straight to the Rothschilds. Napoleon's coronation in 1804 was treated with indifference by Amschel, but he became alarmed when the Pope was invited. The Rothschilds were dismayed and angry when Napoleon"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 41 divorced Josephine and married the Arch-Duchess Maria Louisa in 1810. The Rothschild's recognized that henceforth there would be less and less chance to destroy kingdoms and smash the Catholic Church. From 1810 the die was cast against Napoleon and James Rothschild was seconded to the task of ruining their former hero. The full story of the gradual disillusionment of Napoleon, his awakening to the knowledge that he was not fighting for France, but rather for an alien power to further its grip on the nation as a necessary follow-on to the revolution, the role of the Illuminati and the Masons in his career, made him more and more angry. The awakening was slow to come, and painful, but once his mind was opened to the truth, Napoleon began to rebel against his controllers. In his work, History of Napoleon, G. Bussey says that Napoleon changed, lost his fierce desire for war and declared; Thank God I am at peace with the world. The Rothschilds now had no further use for their former tool. They financed and set up a front called A League Against Napoleon. The mentors whom Napoleon had begun to neglect were now turned against him. Karl Rothschild hastened to despoil relations between the Pope and Napoleon, and without the knowledge of Napoleon, ordered the arrest of the Holy Father carried out by General Radet. The Pope reacted with an Excommunication Bill against the Emperor. Napoleon had been trying to win over the Pope. He felt the ground quaking beneath his feet as events, one after another, went against him. An attempt to assassinate him by Illuminati agent Stapps was foiled by the vigilance of General Rapp. The Russian campaign was plagued by supply problems and lack of food. Napoleon did not understand that it was deliberate sabotage of his army. He was forced to order a retreat from Moscow, during which thousands of soldiers dying from wounds and the cold were mercilessly shot to death by Rothschild's agents coming up in the rear."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42 Dr. John Coleman The loss of Christian lives was horrendous. With the failure to win over the Pope, Napoleon became seriously concerned as his confidence ebbed away. He noted this: The Pope could have been won over as additional means of binding together the federated parts of the Empire. I should have had my religious as well as my legislative sessions. My councils would have constituted the representatives of Christianity, and the successor of St. Peter would have been the President. Too late, as Karl Rothschild had already seen to it that such a plan would not succeed. No historian can tell why Napoleon attacked Russia in 1812. Theories abound but none of substance. Alexander I said of the attack: \"Napoleon waged war on me in the most odious fashion and has deceived me in the most treacherous manner.\" For his part, Napoleon told General Gourgaud: / did not want to make war on Russia. Bassano and Champagny [Ministers of Foreign Affairs] persuaded me that the note of Russia was meant as a declaration of war. I really thought that Russia wanted war. What were the real motives of the campaign in Russia? I do not know, possibly the Emperor himself did not know more than I did. The Rothschilds ruined Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. He was betrayed by Marshal Soult, a man he had befriended, but who was in the pay of the Rothschilds. Napoleon made Soult the Duke of Dalmatia with a salary of millions of francs and appointed him Marshal of the Army. At Waterloo, Soult failed to take and hold Gemappe, an important village to anchor the flank of Napoleon's army."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 43 Worse yet, Marshal Grouchy who was supposed to provide reinforcements arrived 24 hours too late, even though he heard the guns and knew that the battle had been joined. Of Soult, Napoleon complained bitterly: Soult, my second in command at Waterloo, did not aid me as much as he might have done. . . His staff, in spite of my orders, was not organized. Soult was very easily discouraged. . . Soult was worth nothing. Why during the battle did he not keep order at Gemappe? Worse yet, on the morning of the battle, an enemy inside the Corsican's personal staff put a substance in his breakfast that caused him to suffer a terrible migraine. Such is the power of the Rothschilds and the falsification of history; but for the treachery and treason committed against him, Napoleon would have soundly defeated Blucher and Wellington. Soult served his masters well; they gave him some of the highest offices in France. That he was the father of Bismarck has often been suggested, but never proved. At one time Bismarck's mother was Soult's mistress, as confirmed by Bismarck: Not my talents or capacities made me great, but the fact that my mother was the mistress of Soult, [one of the 300] who all helped me. Bismarck was \"made\" by the Rothschilds through the Menkens. His father, William, had married a Louise Menken, whom Count Cherep-Spiridovich said was a Jewess. Marshall Soult, who betrayed Napoleon at Waterloo, was a member of the Committee of 300, who occupied the top posts in France until his death. Soult was often in attendance of William Bismarck country residence and was widely believed to be the father of younger Bismarck.

According to Siem, Bismarck talked with him in 1876 about the Civil War: The division of the United States into two federations was decided long before the Civil War by the High Financial Powers of Europe. Those bankers were afraid of the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their domination over the World. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They saw tremendous booty if they substituted two feeble democracies indebted to them, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing.

But Lincoln read their plots and soon understood that the South was not the worst foe, but the financiers. He did not confide his apprehensions; he watched the gestures of the Hidden Hand. He did not wish to expose publicly which would disconcert the ignorant masses. He decided to eliminate the International Bankers by establishing a system of loans, allowing the states to borrow directly from the people without intermediary. He did not study finance, but his robust good sense revealed to him, that the source of any wealth, resides in the work and the economy of the nation. He opposed emissions through the International Financiers. He obtained from Congress the right to borrow from the people by selling to it the bonds of States. The local banks were only too glad to help such a system and the government and the People escaped the plots of the foreign financiers. They understood at once that the United States would escape their grip. The death of Lincoln was resolved. Nothing is easier than to find a fanatic to strike.

(I wish to reiterate that the preparation for this work I encompassed ten months of intensive research on this particular subject work at the British Museum. The books from which sources are quoted, such as Talks With Napoleon at St. Helena and Propaganda in the Next War and the works of John Reeves -- and many others mentioned may no longer be available). Russia provoked a peculiar hatred in the Rothschilds who set their face against the Romanov family. The daughter of Tiesenhaus, a prominent German historian wrote that she shared her father's distrust of the Tsar: . . . But after meeting him, in common with many others, she was impressed with Alexander's frankness, energy and nobility of character. This impression deepened into a loyal and devoted friendship. {Emperor Alexander -- Mrs. de Choiseul-Guffress) According to Count Cherep-Spiridovich, Nathan Rothschild tried to instigate a revolution in Russia, but was unsuccessful, and Lionel confessed to Disraeli that it was prepared in Germany: The chief agents of the James Rothschild III were mobilized against Tsar Nicholas I to provoke a war in"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"48 Dr. John Coleman the Crimea, but they were unable to win, so they poisoned Nicholas I in 1855.\" (British Museum Papers, Hidden Hand, page 119) In these momentous events, Disraeli played a big role, either as a \"confessor\" or advisor to the Rothschilds. How the Rothschilds gained control of Marie Louise is told by Mrs. Edith E. Cuthell in her book, An Imperial Victim: In December 1827 Marie Louise, the widow of Napoleon 1 raised a loan often ten million francs from Rothschild. On February 22, 1829, she lost her husband Count Neipperg, which remained a mystery to all historians. Prince Metternich who had been a mere \"clerk \" of Salomon Rothschild of Vienna, told Bombelles, another Rothschild protege that he wished a man who could guide the weak character of Marie Louise. Bombelles became the confidant of Marie Louise and then married her. The Rothschilds now had complete control of Napoleon's widow through Bombelles who had captured her heart while she was still Countess Niepperg. According to the author Edmond Rostand, Bombelles was extremely handsome. Writing of Bombelles, Mrs. E.E. Cuthwell describes him thus: He has even more ambition. With his soft voice he whispered into the ears of women. Bombelles wished to marry a Mlle Cavanaugh, who had money. He gained his object. His wife died, bequeathing him her heart in a leaden case. He buried it. A year later he had a desperate passion for another rich heiress, who declined it.

Rumors that she died of poison floated about Parma and spread further. \" (Page 373) Count Cherep-Spiridovich narrates what followed: Bombelles, supported by Salomon and his clerk, Metternich, was appointed the 'educator' of the future Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph. Bombelles was the responsible author of the most awful disloyalty, baseness and cruelty of Austria, which began to amaze the whole world since 1848, when Franz Joseph was only eighteen years old became the Emperor de jure, and Bombelles was the 'power behind the throne' receiving and executing the orders of Rothschild. Their first act was to betray their word to Nicholas I who put as a condition 'sine qua non' mercy for Hungarian General Sheezeny and others. Franz Joseph strangled them, as soon as the Russian troops left Austria. (Hidden Hand, page 123) The Rothschilds were not only moneylenders, but also speculators. The greatest area of interest to them was the construction of the railroads of Europe and Russia, which they latched onto and held onto. In one account of this endeavor contained in British Museum papers, James Rothschild compelled France to accept financing for its North Railroad: The Government took upon itself the obligation to spend 100 million francs in order to build the roadbed. James consented to spend 60 millions in providing rail cars etc. He received during 40 years 17 millions yearly by way of income, i.e. 620 millions in interest plus the principal of 60 millions. In this"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"50 Dr. John Coleman undertaking the Rothschilds used 60 millions of their depositors' money for which they paid them 4% interest, or 2,400,000 yearly, thus getting 14,600,000 francs per annum for their signature. The Journal des Debats in order to deceive the nation stated in July 1843, that Rothschild is begging for the privilege to ruin himself The French press acted the role of agent provocateur as early as fifty years before the scandal of Panama. The Rothschilds coveted this rich prey, the railroads, at any cost. At one time the Government passed through a period of honesty and had the temerity to stem their aggression. In 1838, M. Martin, from the North [railroad company] suggested to Parliament a net of railroads to be built by the State. If M. Martin's plan, based on two pillars of monopoly banking and transportation had been approved by Parliament, the financial fealty would have been killed at its inception. But the Rothschilds, through the press controlled by them, found the way to acquire the railroads. In 1840, the West and South lines were conceded to the Rothschilds and the Foulds. (The Foulds were international bankers strategically placed in France to act out Rothschild orders). By 1845, all the great lines belonged to these two companies. One of the most incisive reporters on the Rothschilds was John Reeves who wrote the book The Rothschilds - The Financial Rulers of Nations. The following comments taken from the book show just how incisive and penetrating of the curtain of mystery surrounding the Rothschilds was Reeves, whose observations of Nathan Rothschild are perhaps without equal: The amount of fortune he left always remained a secret.

There were no legacies to his employees and no charitable bequests. . . the first occasion on which Nathan assisted the English Government was in 1819, when he undertook the loan of $60 million. From 1818 to 1832, Nathan issued eight loans for the sum of $105,400,000. With Spain, or the South American states that had formerly acknowledged the Spanish flag, he would never have anything to do. The explanation of some historians is that it was because of the Spanish Inquisition. One cause of his success was the torturous policy with which he misled those who watched him. In 1831 Nathan Mayer took control of the quicksilver mines of Idria in Austria, and simultaneously similar mines in Almadena, in Spain. Thus all the mercury, indispensable as medicine, was in his hands, and he doubled and trebled its price. It had terrific consequences upon the sick and the suffering of all nations price.. . Another accurate reporter of the Rothschilds was M. Martin whose book, Stories of Banks and Bankers gave some interesting facts. Nathan never paid his employees a cent more than was necessary for their subsistence or at least not a farthing more than they would compel him to pay.

Great prudence marked his enterprises. In the negotiations of foreign loans Lionel was particularly active, as this business at once lucrative and comparatively free from risk, was one, which he preferred before all others. During his lifetime his firm was interested in the issue of no less than eighteen Government loans, amounting in aggregate to seven hundred million dollars. To enter into the details of these transactions would be to give the financial history of Europe. To understand how the Rothschilds prospered, especially in their special area of expertise in lending money to governments of Europe and indeed, the world, I examined the work of John Reeves, whose book we have referred to frequently, and will continue to refer to throughout the remainder of this work as well as the sources in the papers in the British Museum."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 53 CHAPTER 9 A MUCH OVERLOOKED ASPECT OF NEGRO SLAVERY IN AMERICA Before turning to the aspect of successful money- lending, in America as engaged in by the Rothschilds, I shall touch upon the question of slavery that has arisen in recent years. Some say that the descendants of the Negroes should be compensated for the hardship afflicted upon their forbears. It is an important issue given the fact, that the Rothschilds used slavery as an excuse to foment the American Civil War. The idea was said to have come from Benjamin Disraeli, Lionel and James, who sat down to dinner after the wedding of Lionel's daughter for which all the Rothschilds had assembled in London. According to Count Cherep-Spiridovich: . . . The Rothschilds started the American Civil War. Though disputes has existed since 1812 between the South and the North, the war might never had happened, but for the hidden hand of the Rothschilds. By manipulating and inflaming passions the dispute became a cause for war even though the South was beginning to realize, that slavery was not an economic plus. Slavery should never have been allowed in the United States, but alas, it was. There are different kinds of slavery. In Europe, the poor lived in the slavery of abject poverty and degradation. In England and Ireland it was much the same"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"54 Dr. John Coleman story. The poor lived in terrible conditions. Their sons were conscripted to serve in the armed forces and millions of them lost their lives. The British generals, especially Lord Douglas Haig were notorious for the lack of concern for the heavy casualties they suffered. In Ireland, millions died of starvation. While slavery should be universally condemned, nevertheless, it was tolerated in America, but comparatively, the poor classes of Europe, Ireland and England suffered as great hardship as the slaves in America. On an occasion it was doubted whether the slaves in America would want to change their condition with the slaves of Ireland and England. But the hidden hand of the Quakers and \"abolitionists\" kept up a drumbeat of slander against the South until the demons, who had contrived the whole issue of slavery to boil over, got their way. Negro slaves in America were not generally subjected to such appalling conditions of horror. Thus when we examine the sometimes exaggerated descriptions of slavery in America as written, preached and expounded by the abolitionists and the Quakers, we have to admit, if we are unbiased, that comparatively speaking American Negro slaves were far better treated than the poor in Europe and Great Britain: At the beginning of the 19 th century, Great Britain, owing to false principles of government to the ignorant and blind cultivation of trade and industries, had the appearance of a State driven to the utmost opposite and contradictory extremes. Priding itself on the possession of the freest constitution in Europe, England yet concealed the greatest tyranny; possessing unbounded riches, it yet allowed the poor peasantry of Ireland to die of hunger, whilst the privation and distress prevalent"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 55 among the laboring classes was as great and indescribable as to threaten to end in riot and rebellion. The hardships endured by the poorer classes were aggravated by the disgraceful condition of our political system. Morality was at a discount; bribery and intrigue were the order of the day. The thoughts of all were turned to complete forgetfulness of the sufferings of others. Corruption was so widespread, that the independence of the Crown and that of the constituencies was threatened. (Sir William Molesworth) In 1797 the English banks found themselves deeply embarrassed, mainly in consequence of the demands of the Government, which borrowed millions every year for the war and for support by subsidies of half of the Continental Powers. (John Reeves, The Rothschilds, page 162) It would seem that even the Rothschilds could not believe their good fortune. The character, \"Sidonia,\" created by Disraeli in his novel Coningsby and which was in fact based on Nathan Rothschild said: Can anything be more absurd than that a nation should apply to an individual to maintain its credit, and with its credit, its existence as an empire? (Page 248) This very accurately described the Rothschild bankers and their hold over the British Government through extensive loans. No wonder that President Garfield once said: Whoever controls the money controls that nation. The Rothschild's progeny carried on that tradition. For instance, Lionel Rothschild financed the British Government's Suez Canal undertaking. It is more than likely that without Lionel's financial backing the Suez Canal may not have been dug. It was Lionel Rothschild who put up the $20 million that the British Government paid for the land purchased from"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"56 Dr. John Coleman the Khedive. But as with all their ventures, Lionel demanded and got a high return, 500,000 pounds for a couple of endorsements that took no more than a few hours of his time. At a much earlier time, Mayer Amschel felt it would benefit the Rothschilds if he sent his son Nathan to England, where he took up residence in Manchester. According to Sir Thomas Buxton, the reason why Amschel chose to send Nathan to live in Manchester has already been partly explained herein. Many English manufacturers sent in 1789 a man to Frankfurt to offer their goods. The Rothschild trick consisted of keeping him a long time, and later giving him the hugest order for Germany. In the meantime, Nathan was sent to Manchester, where he bought all of the available cotton and dyestuffs. When the representative returned to Manchester with orders, the manufacturers had to apply to Nathan for these materials and he made them pay treble the price and even refused to sell the stuff, thus making them pay his father enormous 'damages.' Then he took the cotton and the dyes to some manufacturers and they manufactured the stuff for him at the lowest price. This base trick ruined many people in Manchester. This plundering made Manchester very indignant. Nathan was frightened and fled to London, where the London Stock Exchange was a larger field for his exploitation. In later years none of the members of the Exchange could boast like Nathan of having multiplied his capital 2,500 times during the course of five years. (John Reeves, The Rothschilds, page 167)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 57 Another reason why Nathan suddenly went to London is given in the documents referred to in the British Museum: The reason also was that Wilhelm IX of Hesse-Cassel (1785-1821) was persuaded by Amschel to transfer his affairs in London, from the bank of van Notten into the hands of Nathan. Of course, 'accidentally' a whole gang of those Frankfurt Illuminati went with Nathan to London to try and do the same thing there, but the British were too clever to be deceived. When France invaded Germany, Wilhelm IX [since called the Elector] gave $3,000,000 to Amschel, which he sent to Nathan in London to prevent it from falling into the hands of Napoleon. Just at that moment the Company of India had $4,000,000 in gold. Nathan bought it and increased its price. He cornered gold in London. This arrangement has endured and even today, N.M. Rothschild fixes the price of gold on a daily basis every morning, and the Rothschild \"fixing \" is accepted as the \"official\" gold price throughout the world. He [Nathan] knew the Duke of Wellington needed it. Nathan also bought the Duke's bills at a large discount. The Government asked Nathan for a loan of his gold and he transferred it to Portugal. Nathan loaned his gold and it was returned, but he compelled the repayment of the Duke's bills at their full value. Thus he made 50%. Then he again loaned his gold at 15% and received it back and transported it to Portugal with a huge commission. The Duke needed this gold to pay the outfitters of his Army who were all Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"58 Dr. John Coleman Jews. Thus not a single pound of gold was received by Wellington, only orders to Nathan's agents in Portugal, who were paid by Rothschild in Frankfurt. This operation netted Nathan 100%. Thus the Rothschilds made colossal profits with the money of the Landgrave, but took all the profits for themselves. (Maria O'Grady and John Reeves) As I said earlier, the descendants of Mayer Amschel became the most powerful men in the world. The one example, perhaps more than any that marks the truth of this observation is the account of how James Rothschild defeated Nicolas I of Russia. It turned on the Russian revolutionary, Hertzen: The notorious author, Alexander Hertzen, one of the pioneers (fomenters) of the Russian Revolutionary movement was compelled to leave the country. (Actually he was forced to flee Russia just hours ahead of the police). He arrived in London, where he started a Russian paper called The Bell. Hertzen, however, was a rich man, who before going into exile had converted his property into Government bonds. The Russian Government knew the numbers of Hertzen's bonds, and when they were presented for payment upon the exile's arrival in London, Nicholas I, hoping thereby to crush his enemy, ordered the Government bank of St. Petersburg to refuse payment. The Bank naturally obeyed. But fortunately for Hertzen he found a champion in the elder Rothschild. The latter informed the Czar that as Hertzen's bonds were as good as any other Russian bonds, he was reluctantly compelled to conclude the insolvency of the Russian Government. Should the bonds not be"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 59 paid immediately, he would declare the Czar bankrupt in all the European money markets. Nicholas was beaten. He put his pride in his pocket and paid the bonds. Hertzen himself relates the story in The Bell under the title, King Rothschild and Emperor Nicholas I.\" (The Fortnightly Review, by Dr. A.S. Rappaport, page 655) From these accounts it can be seen just how much the legend of Amschel Rothschild having made his money as a pawnbroker wears thin in the face of reality, and yet the myth endures that pawn broking was in the beginning the source of Rothschild's wealth. It can now be stated as a fact that there is very little substance, if any, to that claim. In discussing Lionel under the fictitious name of \"Sidonia,\" Disraeli gave many clues to his master's true character: \"It was impossible to penetrate him. His frankness was strictly limited to the surface. He observed everything, though overcautious, but avoided serious discussion. He was a man without affection.\" According to John Reeves: . . . The Rothschild brothers, fully cognizant of his superior intellectual capacity, willingly acknowledged Nathan Mayer as the most fit to direct all of their important transactions. (The Rothschilds, page 64) One of the most interesting of the many interesting facts I discovered in the British Museum in London is the history of the founders of what was to become one of the greatest propaganda machines the world has ever known. I refer to the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations, which became the premiere brainwashing think tank of the ruling elite of Britain. The Tavistock Institute grew into a huge organization, which today dominates the United States and"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"60 Dr. John Coleman Great Britain. This vast organization had its beginning in 1914 at Wellington House, London at the outbreak of the First World War. In charge of organizing a propaganda machine that would persuade a reluctant British people to look upon that war with Germany as necessary for the survival of the British way of life, was no easy task since at the time, the majority of the people had any desire for war with Germany, and there was staunch opposition to it. Placed in charge of the propaganda enterprise were Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothmere. Actually, both men were directly related to the Rothschilds through marriage. One of the three daughters of Nathan Rothschild II was Charlotte, born in 1807 who married her cousin Anselm Salomon, son of Salomon, the second child of Amschel and Caroline Stern of the Frankfurt Sterns. The Sterns were directly related to the Harmsworths of England, one of who became \"Lord Northcliffe\" and the other who became \"Lord Rothmere.\" For full details about the Tavistock Institute read: The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations: Shaping the Moral, Spiritual, Cultural, Political and Economic Recline of the United States of America. (2006) Jacob (James) Rothschild was undoubtedly the most important man in France, having virtually created many French politicians and leaders who owed their position to him. He had come a long way from the thirteen-year old boy that had hardly attended school, accompanying instead, his father Mayer Amschel in the many trips he took across Germany. There he was exposed to the restrictions imposed upon Jews who traveled across the borders of the principalities, being forced to pay a Liebzoll, head tax, each time. James always desired to leave Frankfurt and follow his"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 61 brother Nathan to London, but instead, Amschel sent him to Paris. He left Frankfurt for that city in March of 1811. His arrival in Paris did not go unnoticed by Finance Minister Mollien who reported it to Napoleon: A Frankfurt man who is now in Paris and who calls himself Rotschild (sic) is occupied mainly in smuggling guineas from the English coast to Dunkirk. Francois-Nicholas Comte Mollien was Napoleon's top advisor holding the post of Minister of Finance from 1806-1814. The arrival of James must have been an event of importance for Napoleon, who could not have known what great a part James Rothschild was to play in his downfall, and of course the Rothschilds were engaged in more than smuggling, although that activity was a widespread and very lucrative business for them. When the British blockaded France, Mayer Amschel saw it as a golden chance to make a fortune, and he did, in gold. At twenty-two years old, James was a rather unattractive young man who was almost servile in mannerisms. Some of his contemporaries were not so kind. Castellane, who along with Mirabeau and Clement-Tonnerrre were the high nobility of Paris, found James frightfully ugly, even though he is the Adonis of the Rothschilds'. (Baron James, Anka Muhlstein, page 61) Others were even harsher: A monstrous visage, the flattest, squattest, most frightful kind of batrachian's face with bloodshot eyes, swollen lids, and a slobbery mouth slit like a piggy bank, a sort of a satrap of gold, that's Rothschild.

Before that, he acted merely as the representative of the Frankfurt \"head office.\" This did not alter the solid connection between himself, London and Frankfurt; rather it formalized it and gave him greater status in Paris. He now branched out into tax collecting for the French Treasury and engaged in widespread money lending. When the fortunes of the king changed, and through the Restoration, (the 100 Days of Napoleon) it did not matter who was at the head of affairs, all were beholden to James Rothschild. He seemed able to change sides without losing one scrap of face or influence. The end of Napoleon at Waterloo, engineered by his brother Nathan from London, brought in its aftermath a very profitable relation with King Louis whose return to power the Rothschilds made possible by loaning the necessary capital. The undermining of Napoleon and his government was the work of the Rothschilds who now enjoyed the bounty brought with the Restoration. Napoleon's barely concealed dislike for the Jews contributed to his downfall. The Rothschilds had lived in fear of Napoleon after he refused to attack Christian kings and Christian nations. With peace once more in the air, banker's loans became the biggest and best opportunity to make money, and the Rothschilds exploited it to the full."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 63 CHAPTER 10 NATHAN ROTHSCHILD SETTLES FRENCH DEBTS The French Government had to settle its wartime indemnities and for this, they needed to borrow money. By lending Louis XVIII the money it took to make a triumphant, but dignified return, Nathan Rothschild ensured a \"place in the sun\" for James. The sum of money was reputed to be 5 million francs. True to the teachings of old Mayer Amschel, Nathan did nothing for nothing. His game plan for the loan was to oblige the king to open the doors for James to get into the high circles of society, at the head of which stood the Duc de Richelieu, Premiere of Paris. At first, Richelieu resisted but he had not an inkling of how persistent Nathan could be. Much pressure was exerted upon him by the Marquis d'Osmond, the French Ambassador at London, and by the Austrian Ambassador Count Esterhazy, both of whom were heavily indebted to Nathan. Finally, although extremely irritated by such unseemly pressure, de Richelieu consented to receive James. It did not stop there. Next, James got the chief of police Decazes in his pocket through providing him with \"special information,\" which came to him from the von Thurn and Taxis family of Germany who held the mail contract. They simply opened mail of interest to the Rothschilds and then relayed the contents to James in Paris, Nathan in London or Mayer in Frankfurt.

There was a double benefit in giving the information thus gained to Decazes instead of de Richelieu to whom it ought to have gone. In return, Decazes kept James informed of any pending anti-Jewish moves or political intrigues directed against his bank. With his circle of important people growing wider, James decided that he needed a home more suited to his status, one where he might entertain in the lavish style that was expected of him. He found such a home in a mansion formerly possessed by Queen Hortense on the Rue La Fitte, which had previously belonged to a Paris banker named Laborde, who fell victim to the guillotine in 1794. Hortense, the daughter of Empress Josephine had become Queen of Holland after being married to Napoleon's brother, Louis. It cost James a fortune to have the house remodeled and refurbished; some said the bills came to more than three million francs. When completed in 1834, it became the talk of the town. Heinrich Heine, the German-Jewish Communist philosopher, the Duc d'Orleans and Prince Leopold of Coburg were frequent guests at the glittering soirees given by James. When Prince Metternich and his entourage, including the brilliant Prussian Friedrich von Gentz, who had the confidence of the great man, came to Paris, James gave a party that rivaled anything seen in Paris since the return of the king. Even the mighty Duke of Wellington dared not refuse an invitation from James when he visited Paris. James patronized von Gentz and played on his weakness for women, lots of women, providing von Gentz with the money it took through \"easy terms\" as we say today. Von Gentz got all the women he could handle, plus many other luxuries he had not hitherto been able to afford. Thus did James come to \"own\" von Gentz.

One such person was Ludwig Borne, a strong supporter of the notion that all the kings of Europe should be dethroned and replaced by James, with the exception of Louis Philippe who would be crowned in Paris, so that coronation ceremony would be conducted, not by the Pope, but by James Rothschild. (Notre Dame de la Bourse, January 22, 1832) As previously mentioned, an individual who was patronized by James Rothschild was Heinrich Heine, the German poet who had deserted his homeland and settled in Paris, whether to be near Rothschild, or for political reasons, is not certain. Heine was an avowed Communist and was more than likely on the German police list of subversives and this may have been one reason why he took up residence in Paris. Rothschild helped Heine in innumerable ways, not the least being financial. Heine perceived James a revolutionary and praised him for being 'one of the first to perceive the worth of the Crimieux . . .' Herr von Rothschild alone discovered Emile Pereire, the Pontifex Maximus of railways. (Olivia Maria O'Grady) Not exactly true as I found when I looked at the profit angle that brought James to invest in the new fad. Pereira was a young Sephardim Jew employed by James to do the day-today supervision of the construction work. Through it all, James and Nathan did not stray far from the tricks of the trade taught them by Mayer Amschel, that being never to lose sight of the goal that money was everything.

The business was risky because it involved transport of coinage through bandit-infested areas, necessitating expensive insurance. Instead of transporting physical coinage, James arranged for Rothschild credits to be placed with local banks against which the soldiers were paid. Having eliminated the risk, James and Nathan were able to pocket substantial commissions. This became the basis of new business, the transfer of funds all around the Continent and to London now being done in this way, and the Rothschilds had the monopoly. In order to give readers just a glimpse of the immense power wielded by James I relate the following affair, which became one of his causes celebre and showed how far his powerful arm could reach. A certain priest, a Father Thomas and his servant disappeared in Damascus in April 1840. Murder was suspected and the suspects, who just happened to be Jewish, were arrested, whereupon they confessed to the murder. World Jewry immediately protested vehemently that the arrested Jews were innocent, and that their confessions had been made under torture. James and Salomon immediately brought their combined pressures to bear upon the monarch and Salomon induced Prince Mettemich of Austria to take action. The Austrian Consul von Laurin protested to Mohammed Ali, reporting directly to James and Salomon actions taken. The French Consul at Damascus, however, being on the scene, took an altogether different view of the murder and the defendants the political scene being acute; Louis Philippe dared not risk unwarranted support of the Jews against the Christians.

All that I have so far succeeded in doing is, as stated in the Monitor today, to arrange that the Vice Consul at Alexandria should be instructed to investigate the conduct of the Consul at Damascus.

(The Untold History, Count Cherep-Spiridovich) Some of the important statesmen the Rothschild had under their control began to worry about their power and influence. One of these was Prince Metternich who was under the firm control of Salomon Rothschild and regarded by him as no more than a \"valet\" for the Rothschild family. After bartering away a good deal of Austria's sovereignty, Metternich began to have serious doubts: By reason of natural causes which I cannot regard as good or moral, the House of Rothschild is a much more important influence in French affairs than the foreign office of any country, except perhaps, England. The great motive force is their money. People who hope for philanthropy and who have to suppress all criticisms under the weight of gold, need a great deal of it. The fact of corruption is dealt with quite openly, that practical element, in the fullest sense of the word, in the modem representative system.

It is doubted by historians, that Metternich ever had any conception of the revolutionary forces he had inadvertently helped to unleash. According to documents in the British Museum, world revolution began to go into high gear in 1848, beginning in Sicily in January of that year. The great cities of Europe seemed to be stirred by waves of excitement. Disorder spread to Naples. In Paris the red flag was unfurled over the barricades. Socialist revolutionaries led the workmen and students into bloody revolt in February 22, 1848, and Guizot resigned. (Olivia Maria O'Grady) It is stated that James Rothschild overrated King Louis Phillip, thinking him to be sympathetic to revolutionary ideas. According to Professor William Langer, Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University . . . Republicans and other radicals had accepted Louis Philippe as a revolutionary monarch only to discover their mistake too late. This is surprising, as James Rothschild was known to be a very astute judge of character and one who could read political scenes like a road map. It cannot be said with certainty, but Marshal Soult, a close friend of Nathan Rothschild, who formed a ministry with the Duke of Brioglie, Thiers and Guizot, the latter two men being of a notably conservative side of politics, may have had something to do with it. In 1830 demands by workers stirred up by Marx and his Socialist International began in Italy and Poland, which were not met by their governments. Radical agitation and violence continued in France during 1831:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"70 Dr. John Coleman In November 1831, a large scale insurrection of workers at Lyons was put down with difficulty. There followed a rapid spread of secret societies. Under the regime of press freedom the king was unsparingly attacked and in the radical newspapers mercilessly caricatured, notably by Honorare Daumire. In 1834 there were great revolts in Paris and Lyons, which were suppressed with great severity. In 1845, the radical Fieschi attempted to assassinate Louis Philippe, but the attempt did not succeed. Thereafter, in 1836, the king established a government run by his personal friend Colonel Louis Mole with the Right Center leadership Guizot; but he joined forces with the Left Center Party and overthrew Mole. (The Untold History, John Reeves) To continue with The Untold History: Revolutionary activities prior to 1848 had sent men like Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte into exile from the Continent. England had been their haven. In 1848 they had returned to the Continent to participate in the Revolutions. On February 24, 1848, the Charter and constitution and parliamentary rule seemed to come to an abrupt halt. In all of Paris I did not see one member of the militia, one soldier, one gendarme, or one member of the police. Meanwhile sheer terror gripped all upper classes. I don't believe that any time during the Revolution (1789-94) it was quite so great.

I think it would be better if you returned home rather than expose yourself to bullets whizzing in all directions.' But the Baron assured him that he was safe and was needed at the Ministry of Finance.

In September 1870, the collapse of Napoleon III at Sedan was a blow that the French Empire did not survive.

This happened even as the troops of the Third Republic were entering the city. On May 20, 1871, the Communists drenched all those sections of Paris under their siege with gasoline, setting fire to all public buildings and most private property, including homes. The Tuileries, the Ministry of Finance, the Palais Royal, the Ministry of Justice, the City Hall and the police headquarters were all set on fire and burned to the ground. By a miracle, the sumptuous House of Rothschild and its priceless possessions remained untouched. As always before, the House of Rothschild emerged from the hazards of the war of 1870-1871 and the Paris Commune, financially unshaken and still the undisputed masters of Europe. Again the Rothschilds showed they were capable of switching their allegiance from the monarchy and bestowing it with equal devotion to the Third Republic.

The Paris Commune having run its course, collapsed in a frenzy of blood lust. There appears to be little doubt that the vast sum of money it took to run the Commune (it only lasted for two months) must have come from the Rothschilds. The leaders of the Commune spent 42 million francs, an enormous sum of money for that day. Even with the most prolific squandering it is hard to see how it could have spent as much as one third of that amount. This means that some 25 million francs disappeared in some direction, probably Switzerland, and possibly in the baggage of the head of the Bank of France, or rather its Assistant Governor, the Marquis de Poleis, who accompanied Beslay to Switzerland, when the latter was given a safe conduct pass to leave the country after the suppression of the Commune.

There are always people behind the scenes, as any thinking student of world history will know. What role did Disraeli play in the \"homeland\" for the Jews? In his work Tancred, Disraeli talked about \"those days of political justice when Jerusalem belonged to the Jews.\" Of Jerusalem, he wrote: I saw before me apparently a gorgeous city\" and all through his novels, Alroy, Contari and Fleming, he wrote about his love of Jerusalem stressing that it was a Jewish possession.

He launched into a eulogy of the 'immortal heroes of the barricades.'

(The Paris City Hall) One of the things we learned from the Paris Commune is that it disenchanted the majority of the French people, but the leaders who slipped away to England and Switzerland with the help of the Freemasons and Illuminati, regarded it as a landmark in the rise of International Socialism in Germany, Spain, Russia and Italy. Karl Marx in London became the clearinghouse for International Marxism, but right next to him stood Engels and the Rothschilds. In the Untold History, we are told that the Rothschilds were the agents for the Frankfurt Masons, of which the Landgrave of Hesse was the Master, whose finances the Rothschilds controlled. At this juncture a few notations about Bismarck would be appropriate since he played a major role in shaping the destiny of not only Germany, but the whole of Europe. According to author John Reeves in his work, The Rothschilds, Bismarck was regarded as a mere valet of the Rothschilds and was half-Jewish. Documents in the British Museum suggest that Bismarck's natural father was Marshal Soult, the real \"Waterloo\" of Napoleon I: \"Does it not prove that Marshal Soult was his real father and not the quiet Prussian small landowner, the official father of Bismarck?\" After Napoleon had been put down by the Rothschilds, they needed a new leader and they created such a one in Otto Bismarck. His father, William, married Louise Menken [the Menkens were Jews] â€” a bourgeoisie of unknown origin. He took her into his country place, which the French troops of Napoleon soon invaded, and in a nearby chateau, Marshal Soult established his headquarters."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"80 Dr. John Coleman Louis had been in imminent peril of violation, the champagne of Soult, his Asiatic persuasive powers appealed to the heart of Louis more than the beer and heavy wits of her German husband. Soult has since shown an extreme attention to Mrs. Bismarck â€” Menken and her son, the future 'Man of Blood and Iron.' Soult occupied the highest posts in France and until his death betrayed every Christian ruler. The six years Bismarck passed in Palma Institute in Berlin had left him but regrettable memories. (Cherep-Spiridovich, page 108 -- The Hidden Hand attributed to J. Hoche) Actually, Louise Bismarck-Menken was not of unknown origin. I traced her antecedents to Haim Solomon who is credited with giving all of his fortune to General George Washington to start the American Revolution. The Jewish Tribune of New York of January 9, 1925, also confirmed that Louise Menken was the descendant of Haim Solomon. Certain researchers and historians hotly dispute that the money Solomon gave to Washington was his own, but that it came from the Rothschilds, Solomon being their mere conduit. They point to the fact that in spite of giving all his money to Washington, Haim continued to live in luxury. The story of how Bismarck was co-opted by the Rothschilds can be pieced together from Lord Beaconsfield Letters, December 1812 and from Coningsby: Lionel Rothschild often took Disraeli to Paris where he was introduced to James Rothschild III. They were visited by Count Arnim, the Prussian Minister. Through Lionel, Disraeli became his friend. Soult was a Cabinet Minister of France and spoke much, perhaps, of his son, or the son of his mistress, ex Menken-Bismarck.

But the Rothschilds, Soult and Amim were already watching him and all sought to use him. Even in 1839 at Aachen, Bismarck had shown himself rebellious, as had Disraeli in his poem 'Blessings to the regicide dagger.' But James required that Bismarck and Disraeli display 'arch Conservatism,' which then was winning in order to slip into high society and to acquire power. Therefore, Disraeli and Bismarck dropped the hymns to 'regicide daggers' and became ultra-conservative. Both were ordered to become 'very mundane.' Amim, the Prussian Minister and member of the Reichstag married Bismarck's beloved sister Malvina in 1844 and, according to Disraeli, Bismarck fell entirely under the influence of the Rothschilds andArnim and his sister. Indirectly we learn the statement made by Walter Rathenau that 300 men rule the world (see The Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Committee of 300). Forty years before, Bismarck indicated his agreement with Rathenau's statement: This was repeated by Disraeli when he said that 'the world is ruled by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.' Forty years before Rathenau's statement, Bismarck indicated his agreement with both Rathenau and Disraeli.

With a great deal of effort and juggling, Bismarck's controllers managed to get him to marry Johanna Puttkamer in 1847. Puttkamer was a remarkable woman whose abilities to calm his terrible temper (probably inherited from Soult) because his registered father was a quiet man never given to violent outbursts thus saving his career, which would otherwise have come to an abrupt end. When in 1849 the list of new Cabinet members was proposed to Frederick William IV, he drew a thick line though Bismarck's name and wrote: Red-hot reactionary. Likes the smell of blood. In 1849 Bismarck had himself elected to the Second Prussian Chamber with the help of Arnim and Rothschild, and in 1851 he attended the Diet of Frankfurt am Main as a Deputy. Count Arnim was also behind Bismarck and he did his part by recommending him to Otto von Manteuffel, the Minister of Prussia. Of von Manteuffel, Professor Langer discusses the background to his importance, historically: On May 16, 1850, a number of petty states and Austria met at Frankfurt and reconstituted the old diet of the Germanic Confederation. If Prussia insisted on this union, war with Austria appeared inevitable. When a dispute arose from an appeal . . . both powers mobilized and war seemed imminent. Tsar Nichols of Russia, irritated by the pseudo liberalism of the Prussian ruler sided with Austria, and Frederick William, who had been averse to war from the very outset, decided to beat a hasty retreat. He sent his new Minister, Otto von Manteuffel to negotiate. . .

He had by nature contempt for anything weak, sentimental and among his objects of disdain he included several Christian virtues. (Professor F.M. Bowicke, Bismarck and the German Empire, page 5) In La Revue des Deux Mondes published in 1880 vol. 26, page 203 by Valbert, we read the following: The Jews were the only people who could exploit Bismarck in such a way, where the entire liberal reforms in Germany after Sadowa (where the Prussians were defeated by the Austrians in 1866) introduced by Bismarck, served to benefit the Jews. .. As we have shown, the Rothschilds were particularly interested in the politics of all nations where they had established themselves. For instance, at the Congress of Vienna, the Rothschilds sought to predominate. We learn from Maria Olivia O'Grady: . . . The Jews sent representatives to the Congress of Vienna where they sought to influence the official delegates through bribes and presents. The elder Rothschild, it will be recalled, was fearful of the special Jewish privilege he had bought from Karl von Dalberg, prince primate of the Confederation of the Rhine, might be lost unless incorporated in the new constitutions that the Congress was expected to draft.

Gumprecht, Rothschild's special emissaries, would have been run out of town by the Viennese police, had not Metternich intervened."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"84 Dr. John Coleman The Jewish representatives, of course, had no official position in the Congress. The most important Jewish influence on the members of Congress came from the Jewesses who opened their salons in lavish entertainment of the leading statesmen and rulers who were attending the sessions of Congress. The most prominent of these Jewesses were Baroness Fanny von Arenstein, Madame von Eskeles, Rachel Levin von Varahagen, Madam Leopold Herz, and the Duchess Mendelssohn von Schlegel. The best that the Jews were able to accomplish at the Congress of Vienna was a number of drafts proposals that invariably offered full rights of citizenship to those Jews who 'assume performance of all the duties of citizens.' This clause did not meet with all the peculiar demands and requirements of the Jewish 'nation,' which actually desired all rights of citizenship without the usual obligations. (The Congress of Vienna, pages 345, 346) Author Anka Muhlstein in Baron James, The Rise of the French Rothschilds, puts a different interpretation on the events of the Congress of Vienna and their effect on Frankfurt: Hardly had the French armies withdrawn when the German authorities addressed themselves to the urgent problem of putting the Jews back in their place.

This resulted in a suspension of the Austrian edicts of expulsion along with statements from Metternich and Hardenberg, the Austrian Chancellor's counterpart in Prussia. (Baron James, The Rise of the French Rothschilds, Anka Muhlstein, page 68) According to Muhlstein, Jews were attacked in Frankfurt and severely persecuted.

Metternich then appointed James and Nathan as Consuls, an \"unthinkable honor for a Jew\" as Salomon noted: James did not renew his appeal. Metternich's evident power and protection relieved his anxiety. Thanks to the Chancellor, in fact, the Rothschilds would acquire diplomatic immunity. Having granted them a useful and flattering title, he would now do considerably more. Nathan and James, at the price of numerous skillfully negotiated loans conceived the idea of having themselves appointed Consuls to represent Austria in London and Paris.

Lewis Way, an English clergyman, acted as the Jewish mouthpiece, and introduced a petition to the Conference advocating Jewish emancipation in Europe. Jewish influence in the 1856 Congress of Paris and the 1858 Congress of Paris is evident in the work of both meetings. It does not appear that that Jewry was permitted official representation at either of these two conferences. (Olivia Maria O' Grady) That did not sit well with the Rothschilds who then demanded more and more from those they held in their power. After receiving titles of barons and consuls, they now desired more visible signs of their power to be displayed. Their \"love of distinctions\" was immoderate to say the least. Von Gentz was instructed to let the public know that medals and ribbons were being granted to them, and to advertise the fact: \"Salomon von Rothschild and his brother in Paris have received the order of Saint Vladimir in recognition of loans negotiated for Russia.\""},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 89 Von Gentz wrote to a number of leading German journals.

Despite their millions and their generous loyalty, the Rothschilds have an astonishing appetite for honors and distinction. (British Museum Documents) The Christian religious nature of the decorations made it all the more extraordinary that the Rothschilds were able to secure them, and point to the power they exercised over Metternich and Bismarck, especially as it is known that Metternich began to object to the Rothschilds demands on the grounds that as non-Christians they were not entitled to receive certain decorations, but that did not stop the flood of requests for special honors. In 1867 Alphonse, the eldest son of James wrote to his cousins in London: The most notable outcome of Bismarck's visit (to London) has been the distribution of decorations. My father received the Great Ribbon of the Red Eagle, the highest and most distinguished decoration. No Jew in Prussia has received it. (Gold and Iron, Fritz Stern, page 1150) Continuing with O'Grady's work, her theme of unofficial, but powerful representation at world conventions where Jews had no standing, she refers to American efforts on their behalf: American Jewry influenced the United States to present their demand for full and equal rights' to the Bucharest Peace Conference of 1913, although the United States was not officially represented at the Conference.

The work of World Jewry at the Peace Conference is nowhere better indicated than in the provisions imposed on Poland by the Versailles Treaty. A ruthless conqueror could not have been more severe. The Polish representatives signed the Minority Treaty on June 28, 1919, thereby committing Poland to divide sovereignty and a superior and privileged class of citizenry. (Olivia Maria O'Grady, pages 344-347) It has been commented on many times in history that the average person in most countries has little or no time to spare to think beyond making a living, raising a family and holding down a job making these objectives possible, leaving little or no time to attend to politics or matters of economics or other vital issues, such as war and peace, that affected their lives and their nation. Yet it seemed, that certain groups of people were immune from such restrictions, and always seemed to know where important issues were to be decided, and by whom, and seemed to have a world-wide network that kept them abreast of all political and economic developments.

Continuing with the account by Olivia Maria O'Grady: The dawn of 1919 found Paris literally flooded with Jews from all over the world-rich Jews, poor Jews, Orthodox Jews, Socialist Jews, financiers and revolutionaries, they poured into the French capital, -and they went to work. The Comite de Delegation Juives aupres de la Conference de la Paix (The Committee of Jewish Delegations at the Peace Conference) was fully organized by March 25, 1919. In addition the delegates of the World Zionist Organization and the B'nai B'rith were included in the Committee's membership, purporting to speak for ten million Jews. Woodrow Wilson, Georges Clemenceau and other international figures were putty in the hands of these International Jews. Although the idea of a world super state had long been a Jewish dream, Wilson's conceit in believing it as his own particular creation was pandered and puffed on all sides by the Jewish delegation and their controlled world press. 'The principles of national self- determination and homogeneity were not allowed to be carried to extremes,' writes one Jewish historian with obvious satisfaction."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"92 Dr. John Coleman The finesse of the Jewish delegation is clearly discernible in the finished product of Versailles. The groundwork for the destruction of sovereignty throughout Christendom was well laid by the mastermind behind the Comite de Delagation Juives. Absolute sovereignty was restricted.

Included in the Jewish delegates to the Paris Peace Conference was Jacob Schiff, who was later to become one of the Wall Street bankers who financed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The crowning Jewish triumph was the provision that brought 'domestic group rights' under the International guarantee and jurisdiction of The League of Nation -- not one of them was concerned with 'making the world safe for Democracy'. (Wilson's statement of intent, Olivia Maria O'Grady) Wilson may have been fooled by the intent and purpose of the League of Nations, but a group of wide-awake United States Senators was not. They saw the League of Nations exactly for what it was; an attempt to destroy United States sovereignty, the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and rejected it as such when the treaty was presented to the United States Senate for ratification.

In 1919 he put his fears on paper during a weekend break in meetings of the Conference: When nations are exhausted by wars in which they have put forth all their strength and which leave them tired, bleeding and broken, it is not difficult to patch up a peace that may last until the generation which experienced the horrors of war has passed away. . . It is therefore comparatively easy to patch up a peace that may last for thirty years. What is difficult, however, is to draw up a peace which will not provoke a fresh struggle when those who have practical experience of war have passed away... You may strip Germany of her colonies, reduce her armaments to a mere police force and her navy to that of a fifth-rate power; all the same, in the end if she feels that she has been unjustly treated in the peace of 1919 she will fund the means of extracting retribution from her conquerors. The imposition, the deep impression made upon the human heart of four years of unexplained slaughter will disappear with the hearts upon which it has been marked by the terrible sword of the Great War. The maintenance of peace will then depend upon there being no cause of exasperation constantly stirring up the spirit of patriotism, of justice, of fair play. . . Although Lloyd George made a valiant effort to see that justice was done for Germany, he failed, not for the want of trying, but because of the implacable forces of Internationalism arrayed against him, characterized by the vicious and brutally ugly behavior, attitudes and demands of Georges Clemenceau of France."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"94 Dr. John Coleman That Lloyd George was far-seeing can be gathered from his almost prophetic words written at Fontainebleau in March of 1919. Lloyd George was defeated by the revolutionary forces that had been gathering power since the 18 th century. Well organized and financed, they were virtually unstoppable. In a sense Lloyd George was hampered by the presence of his controller. Sir Philip, A.G.D. Sassoon, Bart, related through marriage and blood ties to the Rothschilds. As a member of the British Privy Council, Sassoon was able to join the secret deliberations of the conferees. Spelling out the French policy at Versailles and its aftermath, TIME Magazine of May 17, 1940 in a rare lapse of Rothschild censorship also confirmed it: To the vital Ministry of the Interior, Premier Reynaud appointed energetic, 54-year old Georges Mandel, until then Minister of Colonies. This was no new job for the sharp-nosed stocky little Clemencist, who as the Tiger's chef de cabinet during the last war ran the country's domestic affairs and kept up civilian morale.

This opinion is borne out by what Wilson said on his arrival in Paris in January 1919: The League of Nations is the central object of our meeting. As is well known Wilson had been thoroughly coached and instructed by Mandel House, the servant of the Rothschilds and he knew that he had to obey orders. In researching the papers of Lloyd George at the British Museum, it became obvious to me that the British Prime Minister had put up a good fight against Wilson, but to no avail. In spite of vigorous protests from Lloyd George, Wilson insisted that the first item on the agenda had to be the proposals to establish The League of Nations. I concentrated many months of research of The League of Nations at the British Museum and discovered that Wilson went to Paris armed with instructions indirectly received from Lord Rothschild via Mandel House as to his agenda. Wilson had endeared himself to the Rothschilds through Mandel House, when as a professor at Princeton University; he tried to end what he called \"snobbery\" by banishing student clubs. He was not successful, but this very early indication of his Socialist beliefs drew the attention of House and eventually landed him the governorship of the State of New Jersey, and ultimately, the job of President of the United States. Chairman Will Hayes of the Republican Party National Committee said of Wilson: He wants to rebuild the world unimpeded in conformity with whatever Socialistic doctrines, whatever unlimited government-ownership notions, whatever hazy whims that may happen to possess him.

There was nothing hazy at all about the clear instructions he was constantly receiving from London via Mandell House. One such set of instructions from London concerned Wilson's Fourteen Points. In fact the Fourteen Points he was to present to the Paris Peace Conference was authored by the Rothschilds and Justice Brandeis, who passed it to Wilson with orders to use as his own at the Conference, under the watchful eye of Bernard Baruch. The second set of instructions, the League of Nations instructions, was also passed off as Wilson's work. His speech at the beginning of WWI, that America was fighting the \"ruling class and not the German people\" was pure House rhetoric. To continue with quotes from Olivia Maria O'Grady: President Wilson, surrounded by the Jewish financial fraternity, pushed hither and yon by the sinister Colonel House, and counseled by the Zionist Brandeis, imagined himself the great \"peace maker' of all history. He was a historian who proved that he knew nothing about history. In the hands of the Jews, who used him for their own particular purposes, he plunged this country [the United States] into a disastrous war, and started a chain of events that were meant to ultimately destroy America. Flattered and eulogized by those who bent him to their will, he fancied himself playing God, remaking the world and its people in his own image.

(Olivia Maria O'Grady) This is perhaps a trifle hard on Wilson who was, after all surrounded and hedged in by advisors: We can now properly appraise this treacherous criminal peace treaty, out of which has grown the present war (WWII). It was not Wilson who betrayed the German government by the promise of his Fourteen Points, nor Lloyd George who was false to the Arabs to induce them to enter the war; â€” it was Jeroboam Rothschild, Sir Philip Sassoon and Bernard Baruch. Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau are culpable only to the extent that they acted in obedience to a power they dared not oppose. These three Jews, representing the money power of the Rothschild family, determined the essential provisions of the infamous peace treaty.

Wilson demanded ratification of the treaty, as it stood, no discussion, no changes, and no modifications. The American people, having been assessed by Rothschild agents in America as sufficiently ready to accept anything it was expected to accept secret agreements reached behind closed doors in 1915. This is what the Rothschilds were accustomed to seeing happen. It was always a case of \"our will be done\" or else expect plenty of trouble. On September 22, 1919, Professor I. Shotwell, an American Fabianist, demanded that the Senate ratify the treaty without delay, and Charles McParland, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches seconded his plea! I mention this to illustrate, just how well entrenched International Socialism was in the United States. Zionism was the key leader, even then. Regarding the Zionist movement in America, there is an interesting account of it in History of Zionism by Walter Laqueur:"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"106 Dr. John Coleman Only in 1917 did the Zionist organization in America come into being. . . But despite the events in Eastern Europe . . . the impact of the movement was hardly noticed in American life. Europe, after all, was far away and the situation of American Jewry and its prospects gave no cause for concern. The movement was basically 'East Side' in character. It lacked money, prestige and political influence. Its leaders, on the other hand, were assimilated Jews such as Rabbi Stephen Wise. . . The breakthrough came during the early years of the war in Europe, when Brandeis became its leader. Brandeis was one of the most respected American lawyers, later a Justice of the Supreme Court. He was won over by Jacob de Haas, a British Zionist and close associate of Herzl, who had settled in America in 1901. Brandeis, in the words of other Zionist leaders was unrelated to any form of Jewish life, unread in its literature and unfamiliar with its traditions; he had to rediscover the Jewish people. But once his imagination had been captured by the Zionist ideal, he devoted much of his time and energy to the movement, whose president he was from 1914 until his appointment to the Supreme Court. It was the identification of Louis Brandeis with the movement, more than any other single event, which made Zionism a political force. To be a Zionist had suddenly become respectable.

Zionism was not the concern of the vast majority of American Jews."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 107 2. The vast majority of American Jews were not much concerned with the war in Europe. 3. Brandeis was not a religious Jew in any sense of the accepted meaning of a \"religious\" Jew. 4. The Zionist movement before Brandeis joined it was basically a Socialist movement of East side Bolshevik non-religious Jews, the very same ones whom Trotsky recruited for his mission to overturn Christian Russia, in other words, Zionist Jews. 5. The majority of American Jews were not interested in migrating to Israel until Brandeis got their attention. Apparently they did not regard Palestine as a \"homeland,\" at least not in the political sense of a Zionist State, because their religion taught that there could be no Jewish State until the return of the Messiah. In fairness and wishing no harm to the Jews, and to be strictly objective, I researched thousands of pages of Brandeis history, but could find no evidence that he rediscovered his Jewish religion. I could find no evidence that Brandeis became a religious Jew. What was discovered was that De Haas had converted Brandeis to active Zionism, which is a political, and not a religious movement, in which political movement Brandeis became more of a convert than St. Paul was to Christianity. Brandeis went on to become the provisional president of the World Federation of Zionists, in itself a purely political non- religious body of non-religious Jews. Perhaps the best-known historic event in which the Rothschilds participated at all stages was the so-called \"Balfour Declaration,\" which is generally accepted as the beginning of the State of Israel in the land of Palestine, which the Zionists had been working to achieve for the past hundred"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"108 Dr. John Coleman years. But by 1914 they had not made progress toward their goal, at least none worthy of mention. Zionism was no nearer to its often-stated goal of a Jewish State in Palestine than Herzl had been in 1897. According to the Congressional Records and papers in the British Museum, plus the War Memoirs of Robert Lansing, the American ambassador to London, and the writing of Ramsey McDonald, the First World War provided a golden opportunity for the furthering of the Herzl dream of a Zionist state in Palestine. Lansing pushed for America to enter WWI in 1915 and in pressuring Wilson, House, acting for the Rothschilds, joined him. Pressures on Wilson were enormous and the United States entered the war in Europe against the wishes of 87 percent of the American people. The impression has always been given by establishment historians that a vast majority of Jews favored the establishment of a \"Homeland for the Jews\" in Palestine. Through a good deal of research I found this to be much of an exercise in propaganda. Actually, in Russia and Britain, there was not inconsiderable opposition to the idea from religious Jews who believed no such homeland could be established until after the return of their Messiah. To blunt the attitude of religious Jews, Weisman made a speech in London on May 20, 1917 in which he asserted, that he knew that the British government was prepared to support Zionist plans for Palestine. Of course he was not officially entitled to make such a claim, but no doubt knowing that the power and prestige of Lord Rothschild would more than likely carry the day, he did so, anyway. The anti-Zionist religious Jewish opposition under the direction of Claude Montefiore of the famous Montefiore Jewish dynasty was extremely upset, especially as Weizman had referred to religious Jews as \"a small minority.\" According to A History of Zionism, a letter, signed by Montefiore and David Alexander, the presidents of the British Board of Deputies was sent to the London Times"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 109 newspaper, which was published on May 24, 1917, under the heading Palestine and Zionism, Views of Anglo-Jewry: They reiterated their protest against the Zionist theory of a homeless nationality, which if generally accepted, would have the effect everywhere of stamping Jews as an anachronism; religion was the only certain criterion. The signatories also said that it would be a calamity if Jewish settlers in Palestine were to get special rights in the way of political privileges or economic preference. This was a contradiction to the principle of equal rights for all. It would compromise the Jews wherever they had secured equal rights and would involve Palestinian Jews in the bitterest feuds with their neighbors of other races. (Pages 193, 194) The wisdom and foresight of the religious non-Zionist Jews views is mirrored in the tragic events that overtook Palestine, which remains in a turmoil to this very day. Years later their views were echoed by a religious Jewish organization, Friends of Jerusalem (Naturei Karta).

Does that sound extraordinary? Yes, it was and could only have been done with the backing of the Rothschilds. One such deception involved a letter from the Zionist leader, Sokolow, who designated another Zionist, a certain Sacher, to prepare a draft addressed to Balfour, that the reconstitution of Palestine as a Jewish state was one of its essential war aims. Having second thoughts Sokolow believed this was too ambitious: If we ask too much we will get nothing,\" a view evidently shared by Lord Rothschild. However, they were appalled when the Foreign Office issued its own draft, which employed such terms as 'asylum' and 'refuge' and 'sanctuary' for victims of Jewish persecution. This was, needless to say, rejected by the Zionists, who insisted that the declaration would have no value at all unless the principle of recognizing Palestine as a National Home for the Jewish people was affirmed.

Ramsey McDonald summed up his feelings about such underhanded behavior: We encouraged the Arab revolt in Turkey by promising to create an Arab kingdom from the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine. At the same time we were encouraging the Jews to help us by promising them that Palestine would be placed at their disposal for settlement and government; and also at the same time we were making with France the Sykes Picot agreement partitioning the territory, which we instructed our Governor General in Egypt to promise to the Arabs. The story is one of crude duplicity and we cannot escape the reprobation which is its sequel. (Emphasis added) What exactly did McDonald mean when he said: At the time we were encouraging the Jews to help us promising them that Palestine would be theirs. How were the Jews to help with the war? By providing men from Jewish countries to fight the Turks like the Arab did? No, it was nothing like that.

Toynbee expressed his feelings of anger about the betrayal of the Arabs over Palestine in A Study of History.

I pondered for months over the statement of Toynbee, because Toynbee's background and affiliations made it highly unlikely that he would express feelings in the least bit critical of the Zionists or of his mentors, Rockefeller and Rothschild. According to documents in the War Office files (and copies in the British Museum) Toynbee was the protege of Lord Bryce, a follower of the Philosophical Radicals. Toynbee followed in the footsteps of Bryce by writing an article for the Encyclopedia Britannica, 9 th Edition. The article was entitled German Terror in France: A Historical Record and it was an unabashed exercise in anti- German propaganda, published, significantly in New York in 1917. Obviously, it was an incitement to help President Wilson with his battle to drag America into the war in Europe. Though none of the claims of German brutality could be substantiated â€” nevertheless, the article was widely accepted as true. It was just the kind of justification Wilson needed from a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, as the reason why America needed to send her sons to die in France \"to make the world safe for democracy.\" We next hear of Toynbee when he was appointed as a Member of the British Delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, - hardly the prestigious position that he would jeopardize at the time of his planned future with the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Foreign Policy arm of the Committee of 300.

Herein lies the seeds of disaster, the origin of the turmoil that continues to this day in Palestine, and fair-minded people, like the Jewish Orthodox Naturei Karta, knew the well hidden history of the Rothschild-Balfour sell-out of the Arabs contained in that document. The Naturei Karta Orthodox Jews do not agree with a \"Jewish Homeland\" conception. This noble Jewish Orthodox movement is opposed to a Zionist presence in Palestine. As for the Christians of Europe and America, they have fallen into a state of indifference toward the fate of Palestine's \"other\" inhabitants. This does not redound to their honor and the Christian ethic of fair play embodied in the words of Christ: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" Throughout the ages, philosophers, historians and scholars have posed the question: Why is it that the history of wars show, that they are always begun by the so-called \"elite,\" the rulers of nations? One reason as enunciated by Henry Clay is when ever there is discontent among the populace, that foreign threat is used as a pretext to quell such unrest. The second and perhaps the most important reason is that all wars are economic in origin. Since control of banking and finances are in the hands of the elite, they have been known to excite wars for economic gains.

The solution, Russell said, is to get rid of what he referred to as \"useless eaters,\" who should be culled at regular intervals. Ten million dead in WWI was not enough to satisfy Russell, who promoted the idea, that plagues and pandemics should be introduced at regular intervals to wipe out \"useless eaters,\" who had escaped the wars. The AIDS pandemic was deliberately introduced in the expectation that it would wipe out millions from the pool of \"excess population.\" The elite have devised ways to preserve their members from plagues as evidence by the success in warding off the Black Plague pandemic of the Middle Ages.

In a classic understatement, Professor Langer then added: \"These agreements were not entirely compatible with other agreements made with Arab chieftains, agreements, which indeed, were not compatible with each other.\" In other words two different mandates were made, offering two sets of objectives, the one totally unknown to the Arabs. Is there any previous history of such actions by a U.S. president ever having been approved? Was it lawful under the U.S. Constitution for Wilson to have carried out his negotiations, essentially in privacy with private persons not officially sanctioned by their government? The answer to"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"120 Dr. John Coleman these questions must be in the negative. The consequences for the U.S. Government and for the American people were far reaching, and humiliating. Moreover, there has never been an explanation for the American people why the Balfour Declaration was submitted to Lionel Rothschild for his acceptation, since he held no official position? For this reason alone, the Balfour Declaration was and is a spurious document. It is clear that already at that point the British Government had begun to double- deal the Arabs and their brilliant British leader, Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence, best known as \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" Professor Langer then goes back two years to October 31, 1914 and gives a full account of the geographical position of the Arabs, and what Britain did to try and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the War in the Middle East: Lord Kitchener (Commander of the British forces) had offered Hussein, the Grand Sheriff of Mecca a conditional guaranty of independence. Negotiations between the Sheriff and the British government were embarked upon in July 1915. On January 30, 1916, the British accepted Hussein terms, leaving the exact status of Baghdad and Basra and of the sphere of French influence in Syria, undetermined. It is worthy of note that there is no mention here of a \"Jewish homeland\" in Palestine being reserved for Jews. On June 5, 1916, the beginning of the Arab revolts in the Hijaz and an attack on the Turkish garrison at Medina. On June 7, Hussein proclaimed the independence of the Hijaz and the (Turkish) garrison at Medina surrendered."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 121 On October 29, Hussein was proclaimed king of all Arabs. He summoned the Arabs to make war on the Turks. On December 15, the British government recognized Hussein as king of the Hijaz, and all Arabs. It was largely in order to strengthen the Arab insurrection that Sir Archibald Murray, (commander in Egypt since March 19, 1916) decided on a cautious offensive in Sinai and Palestine. During all of these revisions and military actions, there was never once any mention whatsoever of a 'Jewish Homeland' in Palestine being a part of any of the negotiations and agreement between the British government and the Arabs. One would certainly be on safe ground to assume, that had this been mentioned, the Arabs would have baulked at it there and then, and would never taken El Arish. The majority of historians agree on this vital point. On December 21, 1916, the British took El Arish, after building a railway and pipeline across the desert. On April 17-19 1917, the British were forced back by a combined force of Turks and Germans with heavy losses. June 28, Murray was replaced by Sir Edmund Allenby. On July 6 began the emergence of the spectacular war hero Colonel Thomas E. Lawrence, who galvanized the Arab movement and took Aqaba, thus beginning the brilliant thrusts against the Turkish garrisons and especially against the guards of the Hijaz railway, the most important link in the Turkish communications.

No British troops were involved in these key campaigns and there is no mention of any Jewish forces being involved. It is readily admitted by Langer and other historians that without the help of the Arabs, the British would not have been able to drive Turkey out of Arabia and Palestine. In reflection, it was the Arabs under Lawrence, who drove the Turks out of Arabia and Palestine. It is utterly illogical to believe, that the Arabs under Lawrence and under his promises did so knowing, that a 'Homeland for the Jews' was to be the reward for their fighting.\" Langer then goes on to say: On the Palestine front the new British commander, Gen Edmund Allenby, had begun his advance in October 1917. . . On December 9, Allenby took Jerusalem. The British advance was delayed by the fact that Allenby had been obliged to send large contingents of his army to France to meet the crisis on the battlefront in France where the British Army was being defeated with heavy losses, and to halt the victorious German advances. The British Army ordered all its forces fighting in Mesopotamia and Turkey back to the German and French fronts to help to stem the advances of French and German troops in Europe. I suspect, that there were no British troops left in Palestine other than a few garrison and supply troops, the vast majority having been sent to France on March 18, 1918. Langer statement, that British forces materially assisted by the Arabs is wrong. It was Arab forces assisted by a few British troops left behind after the main British Army was shipped in France that did the bulk of the fighting. Langer"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 123 added that British forces put an end to the Turkish presence in Palestine. I suggest his account is palpably wrong. It was the Arab Forces that ended a Turkish presence in Palestine. No French or British or Jewish troops were present at major battles in Palestine. That is an undisputed fact. Toynbee and Lawrence were horrified and expressed outrage against Langer's report that appeared in the London Times declaring it false. It is obvious that stripped of his British troops, Allenby had to rely on Arab forces to press his campaign against the Turks, knowing that the battle-seasoned Arabs would push the Turks out of Palestine during their September 8, 1918 campaign. Langer states: The British broke the Turkish lines near the Mediterranean and began to roll up the enemy forces. The British forces, assisted materially by the Arabs under Lawrence, were now able to push northward. Here again Langer very much tries to minimize the key role played by the Arab forces who did most of the fighting. On page 316 of her book, historian O'Grady stated her opinion of the events in Palestine: With the British Army marching on the Holy Land, Jewish prospects for Palestine at the hands of the Kaiser began to fade. If Great Britain would guarantee world Jewry a foothold in Palestine, world Jewry would work for Great Britain. Negotiations were opened with the British government in February 1917, with Sir Mark Sykes acting as the principal intermediary. On November 2, 1917, Lord Balfour reduced the results of the secret bargaining and extensive communications between private persons in the U.S. in a letter addressed to Lionel Rothschild, the uncrowned King of Israel."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"124 Dr. John Coleman This letter was to become known as The Balfour Declaration and read as follows: Dear Lord Rothschild, I have much pleasure in conveying to you, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration in sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet.

The Jews labored diligently to make the Gentile public believe that Lord Balfour, seeing the 'justice' of their cause wrote the declaration after 'selling' the idea to the British government.

Brandeis was a far left Socialist of the American Democrat Party, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice and a member of several Zionist organizations. All through the negotiations of Arthur Balfour and Lord Rothschild, none of which ever included Sheriff Hussein or Lawrence of Arabia; Brandeis acted as a United States citizen and was never authorized by the Congress, the State Department to act as a U.S. government spokesman. It is stated by historian O'Grady that \"President Wilson approved it.\" That raises important issues: When Wilson became involved in the \"discussions\" between Brandeis, Lionel Rothschild, Lord Balfour and the American Zionist Party, was he acting in a capacity other than the President? * If in the negative, was Wilson acting officially in his role of U.S. President? * Had the Congress approved Wilson's acts and were they funded by the Congress? * If in the affirmative had Wilson been authorized by a U.S. Congressional Resolution to act in any capacity whatsoever?

The American ascendancy in the war councils led the British to ask for President Wilson's consent and approval of the terminology of the declaration before its issuance. The draft that was cabled from government to government was handed to the Brandeis regime for its approval. After a most necessary revision, President Wilson acting through Colonel House, who was in full sympathy with Zionist aims, authorized cabling to the British government the version that was published, and which all the allied governments in turn gave their approval. The 'Brandeis regime' refers to the Provisional Committee of the General Zionist Affairs of which Brandeis was chairman. Can you the reader, imagine that!

What immense power do they wield!"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 127 Again, there is no mention of Hussein, Lawrence, the Arab leaders or the people of Palestine being consulted in any way, nor does it appear that the United States Congress knew anything about the secret negotiations between the non-American Government Brandeis committee and Lord Rothschild, Wilson and Balfour. Only the Zionists were consulted. Most students of Jewish intrigue suspected both the British and Jewish schemes and purpose behind the Balfour Declaration. Although the United States had been in the war for nearly seven months when the Declaration was made public, its significance as the factor that involved the United States was not unnoticed. There was considerable evidence available from which accurate inferences might be drawn. Government negotiations for deals of this nature however, are always secret, and it is usually very difficult to obtain conclusive evidence at the time of the transaction. When the event is beyond repair and lost in the mists of the past, men are apt to write their memoirs and to boast of secret exploits that one time rocked the world. So it was with Mr. Landman. He was honorary Secretary of the Second Joint Zionist Council of the United Kingdom, editor of the Zionist and Secretary and Solicitor for the Zionist Organization. Later he was legal adviser to the New Zionist Organization. Under the title, Great Britain, the Jews and Palestine, published in the London Jewish Chronicle of February 7, 1936, Mr. Landman writes in part as follows:"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman During the critical days of the war, in 1916, when the defection of Russia was imminent and Jewish opinion was generally anti- Russian, and hopes that Germany if victorious, would in certain circumstances give them Palestine, several attempts were made by the Allies to bring America into the War on their side. These attempts were unsuccessful. Mr. George Picot, of the French Embassy in London and Gout of the Quai d'Orsay Eastern Section, who was at that time in close touch with the late Sir Mark Sykes, Cabinet Secretariat, took the opportunity of convincing the representatives of the British and French governments that the best and perhaps the only way to induce the American President to come into the War was to secure the co-operation of Zionist Jewry by promising them Palestine. By so doing, the Allies would enlist and mobilize the hitherto unsuspected powerful force of Zionist Jewry in America, and elsewhere in favor of the Allies on a quid pro quo basis. At that time, President Wilson attached the greatest possible importance to the advice of Mr. Justice Brandeis. Sir Mark obtained permission of the War Cabinet to authorize Mr. Malcolm to approach the Zionists on that basis, neither Mark Sykes nor Mr. Malcolm knew who the Zionists leaders were, and it was Mr. L.J. Greenberg to whom Mr. Malcolm applied for information to whom he should address himself... The Zionists carried out their part and helped to bring America in, and the Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917 was but the public conformation of the verbal agreement of 1916."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 129 This verbal agreement was made with the previous acquiescence and approval of not only the British, French, American and other Allied Governments, but also of the Arab leaders. . . As already explained elsewhere in detail Dr. Weitzman and Mr. Sokolow knew that Mr. James Malcolm came to them as the emissary of the British War Cabinet, which authorized him to say in their name that England would give Palestine to the Jews in return for Zionist assistance, through Justice Brandeis in inducing the United States to come to the help of the Allies. Both Sir Mark Sykes and Mr. Malcolm informed the Arab representatives in London and Paris that without the assistance of the United States the prospects of any Arab State arising after the war were problematical, and that they must therefore agree that Palestine should go to the Jews as a regard for their assistance in bringing in the United States. After a good deal of diligent research, I could not find the names of the \"Arab representatives in Paris and London\" allegedly informed of the plot to go behind the promises given to Hussein bin Ali, Sheriff of Mecca and Medina and to Colonel Lawrence, nor does Mr. Landman name these mysterious \"Arab representatives.\" That raises the question \"why not?\" As he mentions everyone else by name, why are the \"Arab representatives\" kept anonymous? What is abundantly clear is, that neither Lawrence or Hussein bin Ali were informed of what was going on, while they were risking their lives and the lives of their men in the war against Turkey, nor could any record be found that these two men knew anything about the secret negotiations with the Zionists nor that they were asked to send their representatives in London and Paris.

Dr. Bella Dodd wrote in 1930 that so bad was the situation under Wilson, that he felt \"modern history is largely a conspiracy against the truth. (The Conspiracy Against God and Man, page 9) I discovered that but for the backing of Baron Edmond Rothschild the settlements of Russian Zionists established at Rison, Zikron and Rosh Pina would have failed and there would have been virtually no Jewish presence in Palestine. This was a key part of Rothschild strategy to make it appear that Jews were already living in Palestine â€” a subterfuge that worked.

We paid with the dislocated lives of hundreds of thousands whom the war wrenched from their accustomed places in a peaceful world. We paid in the imponderable damage to our national morale through the lashings of war hysteria. We paid with a period of economic confusion from which we have not yet escaped. The direct bill for the war reached the figure of fifty-five billions of dollars. The indirect bill can never be reckoned. And what was the quid pro-quo from the Zionists side? As far as I could ascertain it amounted to absolutely nothing. An interesting aside was the failure of Herzl to obtain the blessing of Pope Pius X for Jewish immigration to Palestine: We are unable to favor this movement. We cannot prevent the Jews from going to Jerusalem, but we could never sanction it. According to A History of Zionism, pages 129-130, the exchange took place at a meeting with the Pope in 1903, meaning that Lord Arthur Balfour knew that there was strong opposition from the Catholic Church against Zionist immigration to Palestine, long before he signed on to the declaration, but about which he informed no one. So the pattern of double-dealing was already apparent in 1903. Catholic opposition to Israel may have contributed to the Rothschilds violent hatred of Russia with its large Christian population.

Herzl always wanted to have the final say on everything. There was, as Herzl's critics pointed out, very little specifically Jewish in Herzl. This emerges perhaps more clearly in his vision of the Jewish state... Herzl envisaged a modern, technologically advanced and enlightened state, enlightened by the Jews, but not specifically a Jewish state. (A History of Zionism, pages 132-133) It can hardly be argued that Herzl was interested in Palestine as a religious \"homeland\" for the Jews, particularly in light of the fact, that the bulk of the new settlers came from Russia and had no previous connection to Palestine and there was no history of Russian Jews ever having lived there, nor were they particularly religious. Lacquer makes this abundantly plain. Lord Chamberlain came forward with an offer to provide a \"homeland\" for the Jews in Uganda, even though Uganda was not the British Government's land to give. Chamberlain told Herzl that he had been on a tour of Uganda and thought: Here is a land for Dr. Herzl, but of course he only wants Palestine or its neighborhood. He was right. Herzl brushed aside the idea. His fixation was with Palestine and nothing else would do. On May 30, 1903 he wrote Rothschild: I am not discouraged. I already have a very powerful man to help me. (A History of Zionism, Walter Laqueur, pages 122,123) This was the true autocratic style of Herzl in action.

A protege of the London School of Economics which was a hotbed for Communist ideals, Mackinder nevertheless put up a good conservative front and is believed to have influenced President Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference as to what steps were to be implemented to usher in a New World Order through a League of Nations mandate. It is certain that the Rothschilds provided a great deal of input for the World Socialist dream. One month after Wilson arrived at the Paris Peace Conference, Mackinder's new book Democratic Ideals and Reality was published. The timing of the release of the book was no accident. In his book Mackinder called for a New World Order (NWO) to be established in a One World Government, ostensibly The League of Nations. If this goal could not be achieved by peaceful, voluntary means, then force was to be resorted to. Mackinder admitted that while the New World Order would be ideally a democratic institution, it could never be expected that at times it would not be a dictatorship. The Zionists claimed that The League of Nations was their concept and this is referred to by Maria O'Grady in her book where she stated: President Wilson was surrounded by Jewish financial fraternity pushed hither and yon by the sinister Colonel House and counseled by the Zionist Brandeis. (Page 342) The Zionists greatly favored the concept of a League of Nations and claimed it as their creation: The League is a Jewish idea, said Nahum Sokolow at the Carlsbad Conference.

As we shall see there may have been an ulterior motive to this, as the League was to play a decisive role in granting a mandate for Palestine to the British Government, a decisive step along the road to granting \"a Homeland\" for the Jews in Palestine. With that in mind I return to Lord Balfour and his so-called \"Balfour Declaration,\" based on double-dealing, deception and secret deals behind the backs of Colonel Lawrence and the Arabs. Balfour made haste to explain that a \"Jewish Homeland\" in Palestine did not mean the imposition of a Jewish state upon the inhabitants of Palestine, but in the light of subsequent events, this emerged as the goal of the Zionists. As Balfour put it: . . . but the further development of the existing Jewish community, in order that they may become a center in which the Jewish people, as a whole, might take, on grounds of religion and race, interest and pride. What Balfour left out was that nothing the British did or said could obscure the fact that Palestine was not theirs to give, nor did the British Government have the slightest right to secure a mandate for Palestine. But Balfour, backed by Lord Nathan Rothschild, pressed ahead anyway, as if the two men had an inherent right to act in the arbitrary manner which they saw fit. The right of the Arab and other population groups, including Christians that extended back for more than 7,000 years was totally disregarded by Lord Balfour.

What Laqueur was explaining, if somewhat obliquely, was the \"deal\" the Zionists had struck with Balfour, namely, that if the Zionists could bring the United States into the war on the side of the allies, the British would establish a Jewish Homeland in Palestine in return. At a private meeting soon after the passage of the Balfour Declaration, when asked whether it had been his intention to make a bid for Jewish support in the war, Balfour snapped 'certainly not' and went on to explain that he felt that he was instrumental in righting a wrong of world historical dimensions. In 1922 Balfour made a speech in which he said that the whole culture of Europe had been guilty of great crimes against the Jews, and Britain had taken the initiative in giving them the opportunity of developing in peace, the great gifts which they had, in the past been able to apply in countries of the Diaspora. (A History of Zionism, page 203) Balfour did not explain why it was considered legal to give Palestine to the Jews when it belonged to a people who had been there for 7,000 years, especially as a big tract of land in Madagascar, as well as land in Uganda, had been offered and rejected without discussion.

Confirmation of the true motives behind the Balfour Declaration came from another well-founded source, Congressional Record, April 25, 1939, pages 6597-6604, which reflects a speech made in the U.S. Senate by Senator Nye: There has been published in a series of works under the title \"The Next War.\" One of the volumes in this series is entitled \"Propaganda in the Next War.\" This particular volume was written by one Sydney Rogerson. I have been unable to obtain any trace of his background; but the editor in chief of all of these works, including the one entitled \"Propaganda in the Next War\" is by a man whose name is recognized the world over as a authority in Great Britain. He is none other than Captain Liddell Hart, associated with the London Times, a writer and military authority in Europe. I understand that this particular volume \"Propaganda in the Next War,\" published last fall and placed in circulation, instead of having the circulation enlarged, now is suffering at the hands of those who desire to retire it from circulation.

I wish I had the entire work and that it could be read by every member of the Senate. The following are quotations from Propaganda in the Next War: From time to time the issue of which side the United States would take hung in the balance and the final result was a credit to our profaned machine. There remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world's population of 15,000,000 no fewer than 5,000,000 are in the United States; 25 percent of the population of New York are Jews. During the Great War we bought off this huge Jewish public by the promise of a National Home in Palestine, held by Ludendorf to be a masterstroke of propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to the Jews in America, but to the Jews in Germany as well. George Armstrong in his work The Rothschild Money Trust explains how this came about: There can be no doubt about the fact that prior to President Wilson's second election in 1916 he kept us out of the war. There can likewise be no doubt about the fact that he was elected on that slogan. Why did he change his mind soon after the election ? Why did he make an arrangement with the British Government to help the Allies? That has been until now, an unexplained mystery.

Reciting the Balfour Declaration in the preamble of the Mandate Commission, it dealt with the problems of immigration and how it proposed they were to be dealt with by a number of Articles, of which Article 22 was the most compelling. Nowhere did it deal with the question of Britain giving away land that it did not own: Whereas the League of Nations declares: 'Where populations are not yet able to stand alone, the machinery of government should be set up for them in keeping with the accepted beliefs that the well being of and developments of such peoples forms a scared trust of civilization'. To the inexperienced the subtlety of the way in which the Wilson guarantees were short-circuited may not be immediately apparent, but what Article 23 did was to negate Wilson's guarantees of \"self determination and independence\" and replace them with the imagined right of The League of Nations to interfere in the affairs of sovereign nations and states, in effect soiling its own charter. Thus it"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"140 Dr. John Coleman must become obvious to the fair-minded that from its very inception, the League intended to play fast and loose with the internal affairs of sovereign nations and states.

Lawrence of Arabia and the Sheriff of Mecca were appalled by the betrayal of the British promise to Emir Hussein, who had fought the Turkish Army to a standstill, believing in the promises of Lawrence that Britain always kept her word. At the Peace Conference, the Arabs were represented by Emir Feizal, son of Sheriff Hussein. He had commanded the Arab troops under the direction of Colonel Lawrence, and was a signatory to the McMahon-Hussein Treaty, which gave the written assurance that Britain would keep her commitment and promise to the Arabs over Palestine. Unable to fully understand English and French and not being a man accustomed to dark intrigues and betrayals of one's word, Feizal did not comprehend what was happening, so much so that he appealed to Wilson, who sent an American Commission, the King-Crane Commission to Palestine to investigate. What the King-Crane Commission members reported to Wilson was startling: Ninety percent of the population of Palestine opposed any Jewish immigration to Palestine.

Wilson, bowing to the Zionists who surrounded him, compromised his principles and a bogus \"mandate system\" replaced the \"self determination\" clause. Under the supervision of The League of Nations, a bogus \"mandate\" for Palestine was awarded to the British. Wilson's belief in the \"backward\" nature of non-European populations convinced him that they would accept the mandate system. The King-Crane Commission report was shelved, leaving Imperialism and Zionism triumphant in the guise of mandates. The Commission's report simply disappeared from view. It was not published in the London Times or the New York Times, nor was it put into the business of the House and Senate. To repeat, it simply vanished! But fortunately for \"the sacred trust of civilization\" the report was published in a minor publication called the Editor and Publisher. How and why did it \"vanish?\" The reader can draw his or her own conclusions, which are rather self-evident. When Justice Brandeis heard that the British officials administering the Mandate were not favoring Jews, he immediately set out for Palestine accompanied by his biographer, Dr. de Haas. Upon their arrival in the Holy Land they found the reports to be only too true. Dr. de Haas wrote that the British Commander in Chief and military and civil aids regarded the Balfour Declaration as a forgotten episode of the war.

By this arrogant display of power, Brandeis intimidated all who opposed Zionist policy for Palestine. A few hours later the British Foreign Office was reminding the military authorities in Egypt and Palestine, not only of the verbal content of the Balfour Declaration, but that the matter was 'chose-jugee,' or very much current. A number of Palestinian officials sought desirable exchanges and Colonel Meinertzhagen; a pronounced Zionist was dispatched to Palestine. There had been no protests, no stirring of troubled political waters. The Brandeis direct action diplomacy had achieved results. (Dr. Jacob de Haas, biographer of Justice Brandeis) How in the world could a person with no official government standing, no official position, go to Palestine and Britain and start making demands that the Zionist be obeyed? Perhaps I should retrace my steps and connect some of the threads. It is a fact that when Brandeis went to see Balfour, the latter immediately contacted Lord Nathan Rothschild, whom it would appear, gave the green light for what steps Balfour told him he wanted to take. Thus, in my opinion, there was a definite connection between the progress of Zionist plans for Palestine and Lord Rothschild, leading back directly to Balfour and then to Brandeis."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 143 * The resentment of the Arabs flared into violence in 1929; * Jewish-Arab controversy over rights to the Wailing Wall of the Herodian Temple developed into open conflict; * The Christian Arabs joining with the Mohammedans against the Jews. A British Commission reported that the disturbances were caused by rising Arab fears of a rising Jewish majority and the systematic acquisition of land by the invaders. The Commission recommended that restriction be placed on immigration and the purchase of land. In spite of the cries of the Zionists, the recommendations were accepted. The British Government published the findings in what is known as the White Book, October 20, 1930. . . In November 1938, the British Government announced that it would drop the partition proposal and attempt to promote an understanding between the Arabs and the Zionists. The Arabs took the understandable position that their country was being stolen from them, and that the negotiations were in a category of bargaining with a thief for the return of some portion of your property. When the Arabs and the Jews were unable to reach an agreement the British announced that it would have to find a solution of its own. In its White Paper of May 17, 1939, it rejected its former interpretations of the Balfour Declaration as contrary to British obligations to the Arabs.

So that there would be no doubt as to Britain's future stand, the White Paper declared: 'His Majesty's Government therefore now declares unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arab people under the Mandate as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will. The wrath of the Jews knew no bounds. The new British policy on the subject meant the defeat of their carefully laid plans and they had no intentions of permitting the controversy to end with the White Paper. They unleashed a world-wide campaign of abuse against the British Government supplemented by propaganda material thoroughly distorting the facts.' Concluding at last that Great Britain as the Mandatory would never permit them to set up a Jewish States in Palestine, the Jews embarked on a campaign of violence to drive the British to either repudiate its White Paper or surrender the Mandate to the United Nations. Hagana organized by the Zionists on the pattern of a regular army was mobilized and held ready to strike. Two terrorist groups, the Irgun Zvei Leumi and the Stern Gang were unleashed against the British Mandate authorities and the people of Palestine.

Unfortunately, the fallacy of The League of Nations was perpetuated by an equally bastard creation, the United Nations. On July 8, 1919, President Wilson having acted out his orders from Colonel House who had received them from the Rothschilds returned home. If Wilson expected to be received like a conquering hero, he was sadly mistaken. An indication of the fact that Wilson was under the control of foreign personalities may be deduced from the fact that he had not taken one single member of the legislature with him to Paris or even a member of his own Democrat Party. His advisors consisted in the main of Wall Street bankers and International Socialists. One of the strangest aspects of his trip to Paris was that he and his entourage accepted gifts of jewelry worth more than one million dollars from a number of non-government well-wishers. The political storm that broke over the president when he introduced his One World Government blueprint to the United States Senate was unlike anything ever"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"146 Dr. John Coleman experienced before. Most probably influenced by the domineering \"attitude\" toward Germany that governed the proceedings in Paris, Wilson demanded that the Senate ratify the treaty exactly as it was presented, with no material changes and no debate being permitted. This was an astonishing development in American politics, which had never been attempted before. It was all or nothing based solely on the secret closed sessions held in Paris. (The German delegation was kept in their hotel for a week while this was going on and took no part in it). Wilson was not without support for his dictatorial attitude which came from an American member of the Fabian Society, Professor Shotwell, who more or less told the Senate to hurry up and ratify the Treaty. Shotwell was a prominent member of the upper-level parallel secret government of the United States, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Senator Robert Owen, who had been appointed Chairman of the especially created Federal Reserve Act in 1919, now chaired the commission on The League of Nations Treaty Report to the Senate. Others who backed Wilson's treaty were Eugene Delano, Thomas J. Lamont and Jacob Schiff. Lamont had been a long- time Fabian Socialist-Communist sympathizer, and Schiff later helped to bankroll the 1904-1905 Russo-Japan War, and the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. All were related to or affiliated with the Rothschilds. Most notably, Schiff was a Wall Street banker, who began his career in banking with the financial backing of the Rothschilds, whose creation he was. On March 19, 1920, the Treaty of Versailles came before the Senate for ratification, but strong objections developed at the very outset. Wilson's demands that the treaty be passed \"as is\" angered many Senators who offered a number of amendments and reservations, which Wilson refused to accept on the advice of Colonel House acting for the Rothschilds.

The vote was 49-35. For once, Colonel House and the Rothschilds were on the losing side. Wilson then did an extraordinary thing; he vetoed the joint resolution of Congress declaring the war with Germany at an end! At this point, it is necessary to retrace our footsteps: In the run-up to World War I and Wilson's attempt to embroil America in it, angry voices were raised against Wilson and his administration. In fact, 87 percent of the American people were opposed to war, but could not prevail over the International Socialists and their international bankers. The Chicago Tribune was adamant and scathingly opposed to America's entry and declared that \"Brandeis ruled the White House by secret telephone.\" Cyrus D. Eaton stated: America dishonored itself by entering the World War, while in later years (1925) Captain H. Spencer, in his book, \"Democracy or Shylockcracy,\" quoted a telegram in which Sir William Wisemen, President Wilson's British MI6 controller said: \"Brandeis called Rothschild.\" Justice Dembitz Brandeis was undoubtedly under the control of the Rothschilds. Long after the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, loud voices of anti-Americanism were still being heard. For instance Paul Hymens an ex Minister of Belgian Foreign Affairs said: \"America refused to ratify the treaty and considered void the man who went to Europe to act in her name.\" (The New York Evening Post, July 16, 1925) This was nothing new in so far as the character of President Wilson was concerned. While he was moving every"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"148 Dr. John Coleman political force he knew to get the United States into WWI under intense pressure from the Rothschilds via Colonel House, Wilson had grossly and violently assaulted the United States Constitution by ramming a law through the U.S. Congress, drafting the Militia of the States to be sent to fight in France. This remains, in my opinion, one of the worst violations of the U.S. Constitution in American history; because Wilson did it against the Constitution, knowing precisely what a gross wrong he was doing in disregard of his oath of office. But, before providing details of Wilson's horrendous crime against the American people, leaving aside the crimes against the Arabs and Palestinians, I would like to give some hitherto unknown facts about the man who was Wilson's controller and alter ego Colonel Mandel House, simply because this mysterious and sinister man played such a huge background shadowy role in the history of he United States, plus the fact that he was an intimate friend of the Rothschilds. Edward Mandel House was the son of Thomas William and Elizabeth (nee Shearn). House had immigrated to the United States in 1837 and gone to live in Texas where he became involved in the cotton industry and entered into banking for and on behalf of the Rothschilds. House, the elder, always acted as the trusted agent for the Rothschilds. Edward was educated at Cornell and became an adviser to the Governor of Texas although holding no official position, a career that was duplicated in the Wilson administration. The State of Texas made the younger House an honorary Colonel, a title to which he clung all through his extraordinary career. There is no indication why the State of Texas bestowed favors on Edward House.

Thus it may be safely stated that House presided over twenty-five fateful years that changed the face of the United States forever, and led to a lawless Federal Government that destroyed in a few years what the Founding Fathers and the generation that followed had taken almost two hundred years to build.

I believe that these most profound changes could not and would not have occurred save and except for the guiding hand of the Rothschild Dynasty and the commitment of its vast financial resources to this end.

They were angered by British interference in their lives, particularly the freeing of slaves. They overcame great hardships traveling a thousand miles in ox wagons often over rugged mountains, and settled on the barren land of what was to become the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics. When huge finds of diamond and gold occurred, the barren lands were immediately coveted by the Rothschilds who sent an agent in the person of Cecil John Rhodes to tie up possession and control in their name. In 1898, Rhodes, the agent for the Rothschilds in South Africa, requested Lord Rothschild to buy out French interests in the diamond mines, setting the stage for complete control by the Rothschilds. The British Government \"annexed\" an area of the Orange Free State known as Griqualand West (the location of the diamond finds) and three years later annexed the Transvaal, although in both cases they had no lawful or legitimate claim to the land whatsoever, a tactic they were to use again in Palestine in 1917. (The Balfour Declaration) Cecil Rhodes was the chief instigator of the Boer War. The fabulous gold fields of rich veins, which extended for 200 miles from East to West, was a glittering prize the Rothschilds were determined to acquire. Friction with Britain became endemic as the Boers refused to recognize Queen Victoria's bogus claims to the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republics. A clear provocation was the raid by 600 armed men under Starr Jameson in an attempt to overthrow the Boer Government of President Paul Kruger. It was a prelude to the Anglo-Boer War, which broke out in 1899, after the machinations of Rhodes to achieve the desired goals of the British Government to seize the gold and diamond fields, failed."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 153 The Boers were descended from Dutch, Irish, Scots, English and German stock. They had emigrated to the southern- most tip of Africa known as \"the Cape,\" where first the Dutch and then the British established a refueling, food and fresh water station for their ships plying trade between the Far East and Europe. At what became known in later years as Cape Town, a thriving independent community was established under Dutch rule. At that time there were no black (Bantu) people in Africa south of the Zambezi River, in the vast, empty hinterland between the Cape and the Zambezi River to the North. Only a few nomadic \"Hottentots\" - a non-Bantu Mongolian type of people lived along the sea shore of the Cape eking out a precarious living through beachcombing and scavenging. They soon became workers in the vegetable gardens of the Dutch East India Company. But the British invaded the Cape settlement and set up their own administration under the British East India Corporation (BEIC) opium trading company in London. From this inauspicious beginning grew a thriving, bustling community in which the Dutch were integrated. After the British invasion, the BEIC in London began to seriously interfere in the internal affairs of the Dutch community. The Dutch, who were referred to as \"Boers\" (farmers) then began to organize a plan to leave the Cape and \"trekked\" (traveled) into the vast uninhabited plains of the north. After the long journey the Boer arrived and settled in the uninhabited land they named the Orange Free State Republic and the Transvaal Republic. I want to emphasize that the thousands of square miles of land the Boers traveled through was devoid of the Bantu races who lived north of the Zambezi.

War was inevitable after Victoria rejected the peace proposals of the God-fearing Paul Kruger. Queen Victoria was determined to have war, and in 1899 the British Government sent the first contingents of troops, which by 1901 would reach the amazing strength of 400,000 men, this, to overcome a guerilla force that never numbered more than 80,000 men in the field at any time, many of them as young as fourteen years and as old as seventy five years. The epic struggle of the Boers ought to be a model for all countries threatened by big, bullying governments. For almost three years the farmer-soldiers fought and defeated the pride of the British Army. The Boers only agreed to end the fighting after 27,000 of their women and children died in inhuman concentration camps set up by Lord Kitchener and Alfred Milner, a servant of the Rothschilds. With their cattle slaughtered, their farms burned to the ground and their women and children dying in the thousands as a result of the vindictive Lord Milner's genocidal policies, the Boer warriors were compelled to come in from the field and lay down their arms. Throughout the struggle, Rhodes kept his masters, the Rothschilds, fully briefed and carried out their instructions to the letter. Today, N.M. Rothschild still controls the gold trade from London. Rhodes operated in a period when the British Empire was the most powerful political, economic and military force in the world, yet the Boers were not afraid to take on the Empire in a war they knew they could not win, but which they fought with astonishing courage, determination and bravery.

Behind the government stood the banking families, of which the Rothschild banks were the most powerful and influential. Some historians have held to the belief that the fortune they received from South Africa \"made the Rothschilds rich.\" It is a belief with which I do not agree. The Rothschilds were wealthy beyond belief well before their agent, Cecil John Rhodes, a master of deceit and cunning, a man who hated Christianity â€” secured the gold and diamond treasures of South Africa as the monopoly of the Rothschilds. From documents and papers I studied in the British Museum in London, it was clear that shortly before the death of Mayer Amschel, his fortune exceeded the combined fortunes of the world's richest men. The full extent of the Rothschild fortune was never made known, but what is known is that it grew at an astronomical rate. Amschel knew the power of money and like old John D. Rockefeller who aped his philosophy of secrecy Mayer knew that secrecy is paramount to success. His religious belief that the Jews were God's chosen people never wavered, and he flaunted his belief on every occasion, public and private. To give some idea of the Rothschild wealth I provide the following: His son Lionel was the friend and counselor of the Prince Consort and of Disraeli whose Sidonia in Coningsby is a (thinly disguised) ideal portrait of him. . .

He had a large share in the successful funding of the United States national debt, provided the funds for the immediate purchase of the Suez Canal shares; he was also active in facilitating the payment of the French indemnity to Germany; in directing the finances of the Austrian Empire and the Egyptian loan of 8,500,000 pounds (about $40,000,000). (The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 10, pages 501-502) Jacob (James) Rothschild's fortune, which was independent of Lionel's or any of the other family members, was estimated by historians to be $200 billion at the time of his death according to author Armstrong who wrote. . . \"But this was only an estimate, since no inventory of his estate was filed.\" It was of course in keeping with one of the principles laid down by Amschel that secrecy was to be maintained.

Seligman Brothers and Speyer and Company financed the North and Messrs Erlanger the South in the Civil War.

But this, incredible as it may seem, was what their vast influence, combined with their enormous wealth and unlimited credit, enabled them to do, for no firms existed strong enough to oppose them for any length of time, or rash enough to take up a business which the Rothschilds had refused.

In the first instance, the Federal Reserve Bank is not \"Federal\" being owned by anonymous stockholders, and not by the United States Government. In plain language it is a private bank masquerading as a federal government institution.

The depredations and the iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over. This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States; has bankrupted itself, and has practically bankrupted our Government. It has done this through defects of the law under which it operates, through misadministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board, and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it. Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are not Government institutions.

It has been said that President Wilson was deceived by the attentions of these bankers and by the philanthropic poses they assumed. It has been said that when he discovered the manner in which he had been misled by Colonel House, he turned against that busybody, that 'holy monk' of the financial empire, and showed him the door. He had the grace to do that, and in my opinion, he deserves great credit for it. In 1912 the National Monetary Association, under the chairmanship of the late Senator Nelson Aldrich, made a report and presented a vicious bill called the National Reserve Association bill. This bill is usually spoken of as the Aldrich bill. He was the tool, but not the accomplice, of the European-born bankers who for nearly 20 years had been scheming to set up a central bank in this country and who in 1912 had spent and were continuing to spend vast sums of money to accomplish their purpose. . . . Under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind Colonel House, established here in our free country the worm-eaten monarchical institution of the 'king's bank' to control us from the top downward, and to shackle us from the cradle to the grave.

The Aldrich bill was created by bankers of European origin in New York City. It was a copy and in general a translation of the Reichsbank and other European central banks.\" (Notably the Bank of England) (From the Congressional Records of the House of Representatives, the Collected Speeches of Congressman Louis T. McFadden) On Thursday June 15, 1933, McFadden went to do battle once more against the imposition of a central bank on America, in gross violation of the United States Constitution. Speaking in the House of Representatives, McFadden complained about foreign bankers taking over the money and credit of the American people, and he concentrated on Jacob Schiff, whom he said, was an agent of the Rothschilds: He also hit out at a Mr. Mayer who is a brother-in-law of Mr. George Blumenthal a member of the firm of J.P. Morgan and Co., who, I understand, represents the Rothschild interest... I want to make it perfectly plain, that in placing Mr. Mayer at the head of the Federal Reserve system you are turning it over completely to this international finance group. How was the U.S. forced into the slavery of the Federal Reserve Bank system? The answer is really quite simple:"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 163 It was done through the money power of the Rothschilds and a group of traitors in the U.S. House and Senate willing to sell their souls in exchange for a life of opulence and ease. Such men are found in all countries, and there is no way to foreclose against their treachery. Their infamous deeds continue to reap a bitter harvest. For daring to expose the truth about how August Belmont entered the United States for the sole purpose of gaining control of politicians who would make it possible to impose Rothschild control of the money and credit of the United States, McFadden was murdered. There were three attempts on his life; one by a shooting that did not succeed, and two attempts to poison him, the last of which killed this great and courageous American. His murderers were never found and justice has still to be done. Thus was a great American Christian patriot silenced, an unspeakable foul deed was done and financial slavery imposed on the American people. For as long as the elected representatives of the people in the U.S. House and Senate abide by their oath of office, to preserve and protect America from the ravages of the international bankers who lead International Socialism's onslaught against the Constitution, the blessings of liberty shall be those of the American people. But when our representatives bow to the money power of the international bankers and prostitute themselves on the alter of Rothschild money power then has the hour arrived that We, the People have lost our freedom and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Federal Reserve Act was a smashing blow against the Constitution, another nail in the coffin of a once-free American people. The Federal Reserve Act was a progression along a road that will end with the total destruction of the Constitution. One of the Rothschild servants, Lord Bryce, said that it would take fifty years to destroy the Republican form of government guaranteed to the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164 Dr. John Coleman American people by their Constitution. Lord Bryce predicted that: Security provided by for the protection of the Constitution will be gone like the morning mists. This is the same Lord Bryce, who through false testimony published shameless lies about German atrocities in Belgium that brought the United States into the First World War. Having acquired control of the leading banks of Europe and having become the lenders of first resort to every government on the Continent and England, the Rothschilds then acquired control of the Bank of England. In order to hide this fact it was decreed that the names of the bank's stockholders were never to be made public: This power brought about the establishment of the gold standard, first in the British Empire, and then in other countries as stated. They acquired the controlling interest in the Bank of England for which the late Lord Rothschild was the gold agent and governor. The Bank of England is one of their many fronts. They no doubt have the controlling interest in most of the other central banks of issue. In strict keeping with the secrecy which has been one of the cardinal principles of the Rothschild rulers from the very beginning, the Bank of England refuses to reveal its stockholders. . . They [the Rothschilds] sent one of their agents, Paul Warburg, as their representative to America, just prior to World War I, to change our banking systems. Through their ownership and control of J. P. Morgan and Co. and Kuhn, Loeb and Co., private banks, they owned and controlled the principal New York"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 165 national banks and trust companies, and through them controlled the New York Federal System. . . It is essential in order to control at will the expansion and contraction of credit that there be some supreme authority with the power to increase or decrease at will the volume of money in circulation. Prior to the regime of the Rothschilds this power resided in the kings and emperors of the world, for they were then the supreme authority. In our country (the United States) our National Constitution vested this power (solely) in the Congress of the United States. . . Under the Rothschild influence the banking systems of the world were all radically changed. The supreme authority for the issue of money, as well as to extend credit, was transferred by the various governments to the bankers of their respective countries. The Bank of England became the model for other central banks of the world. At the time of the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, our government was the only one of any consequence that even pretended to exercise its sovereign right to issue and control the volume of money in circulation. The establishment of the Federal Reserve System brought about a complete surrender to the banking fraternity of the sovereign power of the American people to regulate values through their congressional representatives, as guaranteed to them by their national Constitution. The panic of 1907 was, like all our other panics, a manipulated one. It was brought about by the refusal of the reserve bank of New York to pay currency to their country bank depositors, which in turn made it necessary for these banks to refuse to pay their depositors in currency. It was therefore due primarily"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166 Dr. John Coleman to an insufficient quantity of currency in circulation and an inadequate method of increasing the supply. In the midst of the campaign for the reform of our banking and currency system (to prevent further manipulations that could result in panic) Paul Warburg, a German Jew, migrated from Frankfurt am Main, the original home of the Rothschilds, to America. He was at that time a member of Kuhn, Loeb and Company in New York, the American branch of the Rothschilds, upon his arrival here. The following is a Naval Secret Service report on him in December 1918: 'Warburg, Paul, New York City, German; was naturalized as an American citizen 1911, was decorated by the Kaiser; was vice-chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board, is a wealthy and influential banker; handled large sums of money furnished by Germany for Lenin and Trotsky; subject has a brother who is leader of the espionage system of Germany.' The Federal Reserve System is the product of the Rothschilds and its adoption was secured by the same underground, deceptive manner that they always employ to obtain their objectives. Paul Warburg evidently came to America to reform our banking and currency system and evidently he and the Rothschild interest then anticipated the world war [the First World War 1914-1918] although it did not come about until some three years later.

We are reminded by the words of Jesus Christ at his crucifixion when He said: \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\" This prayer of forgiveness was for and behalf of the Roman soldiers, and not for the Sanhedrin, who had demanded his execution. Thus we say of those members of the U.S. Congress who were ignorant of what was being done, and ignorant of the gigantic swindle being perpetrated upon them, and worse still, ignorant of the Constitution they had sworn an oath to uphold: \"Father, forgive them for they knew not what they did.\" But for the traitors, the deceivers, the liars and the betrayers who did know what they were doing, I say that death by hanging for treason, as suggested by the framers of the Constitution, would have been far too lenient a fate for them. Some scholars of the period wondered why the Federal Reserve Act was presented when it was. Two reasons come to mind. A pliant Socialist president in the White House, the architects of the Federal"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"170 Dr. John Coleman Reserve knew that war was coming. Thus it was essential to have the Central Bank up and running before hostilities commenced. Subsequent history has shown that the Federal Reserve Act was passed in time to make the coming war happen. Without the massive financing provided by the U.S. there is every reason to believe, that WWI would not have broken out. The second reason is, of course, the more obvious one: Complete control of banking and finance of the United States. Passage of the illegal, unconstitutional, Federal Reserve Act made it possible for the Rothschilds through the treason of Wilson, to drag the United States into WWI that resulted in the death of millions of young Christian men, the flower of the European and American nations, and cost the United States billions of dollars. The treason-mongers were never punished and America is still suffering today from the effects of that terrible war and the one that followed, and from the stranglehold which the Rothschilds have over an allegedly \"free America\" from which they continue to reap obscene profits. Any real freedom for the American people ended the day that the Rothschild gained control of America's currency, credit and economy through establishment of the Federal Reserve Banks. When one considers the power of the Rothschild to have been able to establish their banking system in the heart of the American republic, we are reminded of the following verse: Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed that he has grown so great? The story of that \"meat\" is what I have tried to recount in this work and perhaps it will shed some light on the mystery of how both Wilson and Roosevelt were able to impose their wills upon the American people, even though they had the shocking example of the treason committed by President Woodrow Wilson still fresh before their eyes."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 171 There can be but one answer as to the source of that power; the Rothschild agents in America who desired and actively sought American entry into WWII. The book, Propaganda in the Next War, authored by Captain Liddell Hart, throws a good deal of light on how, for the second time, the American people were dragged into a war in Europe although the vast majority of them totally opposed, but unfortunately, the book appears to rendered unavailable. Author Armstrong said: Apparently it is a semi-official book of the British government. The destruction of these copies of the book was probably by the order of Secretary of War, Hoar- Belisha... The establishment of a Jewish homeland was not an issue in the world war or in the peace treaty with Germany. The Arabs were our allies and they fought side by side with the soldiers of the allies. It was coldblooded indefensible robbery perpetrated at the instance of 'Elders,' Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson and Georges Clemenceau. (Rothschild Money Trust, pages 65, 79) The worst of it is that the establishment of this 'Jewish homeland' was cold-blooded treachery to the Arab Government and the people. The Arabs claim that they were induced to enter the war on the side of the Allies by the promise that what is known as the Balfour Declaration would be rescinded and the Arabians would not be molested in the peaceful ownership and possession of their country. This contention is not denied by the British Government, but the excuse is made that Woodrow Wilson insisted that the Jews be given this home and"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"172 Dr. John Coleman that Lloyd George consented as a matter of policy and in order to get some other things in the peace treaty that he desired. Palestine is now properly called the 'twice promised land.' It is likely that Germany also promised it in consideration of the Russian deal. (Rothschild Money Trust, page 70) One of the least noticed after effects of WWI and the subsequent peace treaty was the demonetizing of silver, which has always figured prominently in the monetary systems of the world since ancient times. Silver is a noble metal, but it is not regarded as being anywhere near as valuable as gold by the Rothschilds although it has always been a good defense against inflation. Neither silver, gold coins nor scripts/certificates can be inflated. It was most probably with this in mind that the Rothschilds made strenuous efforts to demonetize silver and get rid of coinage in the money systems of the world. I do not propose to give a history of the Bank of England in this book other than to refer to it from time to time. The Bank of England was and still is the model for all \"fractional reserve banks,\" including the illicit Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. Its original charter was amended eight times up to 1844, and undoubtedly, the Rothschilds had a great deal to do with the latter amendments, especially the Peel Amendment, which made drastic changes that greatly favored the Rothschilds' banks. The Peel Amendment was adopted in 1844 and its immediate effect was to demonetize silver, which had hitherto circulated as coinage in every country, even nation, since time immemorial as real money. This was done because the Rothschilds wanted their war debts to be repaid in gold, a fact that became apparent when they refused to accept payment of Civil War debts in silver and demanded of the United States Government that the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 173 debts be paid in gold. No doubt the Peel Amendment foresaw such matters and was adopted specifically to lay the foundation for what was to follow. The amendment also gave the British a monopoly over gold, because they held the gold stolen from the Boers of South Africa in 1899-1902. Incidentally, it was Peel who had steered the Jewish Disabilities Bill through the House that made it possible for a Jew to run for public office for the first time in the long history of England. But in the middle of the struggle against strong opposition, Peel fell of his horse while out riding and died from his injuries. He was an accomplished horseman, which makes the accident all the more strange. That left Disraeli the chief protagonist for the bill. Disraeli's maiden speech to the House of Commons on December 7, 1847 as party leader, had been drowned out by his opponents led by the feared Irishman, Daniel O'Connell. Those for the Jewish Disabilities Act were Sir Moses Montefiore, related through marriage to the Rothschilds, and one of two Sheriffs of the City of London. Although a Jew, Montefiore could hold the high office, because the House of Lords had no jurisdiction or control over the City of London. Montefiore had come to the House to receive permission to listen to the debate. The bill was presented not directly, but what it became known as, a bill to remove restrictions from all faiths, what the Rothschilds always did, calling such an approach as a \"side wind.\" The measure was to end the longstanding practice, which held, that Jews could not become magistrates, schoolteachers or enter Parliament; could not vote if they refused to take the Christian oath and could not practice law. Lionel de Rothschild had refused to take the Christian oath, and although elected to the House of Lords could not take his seat because of his obdurate opposition to the Christian oath being administered."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"174 Dr. John Coleman The 'Jew bill' as it was referred to by the Tories would not go away, even after eleven years of opposition by members like Lord Derby, Lord Bentinck and Sir Robert Inglis, who when asked why Jews should be excluded from Parliament stated: \"The Jews are voluntary strangers here, and have no claim to become citizens but by conforming to our moral law, which is the Gospel.\" The Tories in the House of Lords were solidly against the \"Jew bill\" as Lord George Bentinck called it as he explained it each time the bill came up again for eleven years. One must give credit to the tenacity of the Rothschilds, when they wanted something they clung on tenaciously until they got it. As Lord Bentinck explained: The Jew Question I look upon as a personal matter as I would a great private estate or Divorce Bill. Disraeli will of course warmly support the Jews, first from hereditary prepossession in their favor and next because he and the Rothschilds are great allies. (From Hansard Report) Bentinck was later found dead, apparently from a heart attack at the age of forty-six. Like the death of Peel before him, Bentinck's passing left many unanswered questions, the most pertinent of which have never been addressed. On February 20, 1849 the Jewish Disabilities Removal Act came up again for consideration in its third reading in the House with Disraeli in charge. In the gallery sat Louise de Rothschild, observing the proceedings on behalf of Lionel Rothschild. The measure passed by a vote of 272 to 206, but died in the Lords. In the following year, July 29, 1850, Lionel de Rothschild again tried to take his seat, but the Clerk refused to allow it and thus was generated a new round of frenzied activity characterized by scathing debate."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 175 The measure was now being referred to in the Times as the \"annual pastime\" of Parliament. Having been struck down in 1849, 1851, 1853, 1856 and 1857, Disraeli in 1858 tried a new tack by changing the wording of the Oath, but the Lords again rejected it. Disraeli hit back by appointing a committee to look into a basis of the restoration of the new Oath and appointed Lionel de Rothschild on the committee. Finally, amid ugly scenes and rearguard opposition from Lord Derby, much grumbling with a razor-thin majority voting for it, a compromise was reached: Each House would formulate its own Oath. At the sumptuous home of Lionel de Rothschild there was great rejoicing that the \"eleven years of shouting and screaming in every corner of the House\" was over. On July 26, 1858, Lionel de Rothschild was sworn in on the new, non-Christian Oath, shaking hands with Disraeli as he went up to do so in a public display of the gratitude he owed his protege whom he had wisely and with great foresight, converted to Christianity at a tender age possibly in anticipation of his need for the very service he had now delivered."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 177 CHAPTER 22 THE ROTHSCHILDS BREAK OPEN THE HOUSE OF LORDS The floodgates had been opened. Lord Rothschild took his seat, followed in quick succession by David Salomons, Sir Francis Goldsmith, Nathaniel de Rothschild, Frederick Goldsmid and Julian Goldsmid. It is interesting that none of these men represented Disraeli's own party, the Conservative Unionist Party \"Tory Party.\" But the chief opponent, Earl Derby, now losing support from his own party, put his objections in writing: Without imparting any disloyalty or disaffection to Her Majesty's Subjects of the Jewish Persuasion, the Lords consider that Denial and Rejection of that Savior, in whose Name each House of Parliament daily offers up its collective prayers for the Divine Blessing on its Councils, constitutes a moral unfitness to take part in Legislation of a professedly Christian Community.

The miscreants worked so skillfully that while the victims were walking around with their eyes wide open, yet not comprehending what they saw, the Rothschild solidified their grip on world monetary systems. Of course the deception is still practiced today where U.S. coinage is made to look like silver, but which coinage has no silver content whatsoever. U.S. coinage might as well be made of plastic, but that would not do, because then the multitudes might just wake up to the deception after all these years! Even the Encyclopedia Britannica sought to conceal the deception of the Peel Amendment: It was indispensable in attempting to obviate the defects inherent in our currency, to proceed cautiously, to respect, as far as possible, existing interests, and to avoid taking any steps that might excite the fears or suspicions of the public; but the measures . . . were so skillfully contrived as to provoke little opposition, at the same time that they effected most important and highly beneficial changes. (Encyclopedia Britannica Vol. III, page 323) For instance: What were the \"defects\" it speaks about? The principle \"defect\" was that hitherto it had not been easy to wage war, as there was never enough money for such wars and additional money had to be raised by additional taxation. This meant that at some point, even the slumbering multitudes would become enraged and rise in rebellion against overburdening taxes. The other \"defect\" was that paper money had to be backed by bullion and what was desirable was the full practice of the old Babylonian system of fraudulent fractional reserve banking meaning in plain language that banks could"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 179 issue a certain amount of paper money not backed by real assets such as silver and gold. Without these changes and the flood of paper money that followed the Peel Amendment and the Federal Reserve Banks establishment in America, WWI and WWII would not have been possible to promote. There was simply no real money for such wasteful wars, nor would the people have stood for additional taxes to finance such misadventures. In fact, there would have been no Gulf War, no invasion of Iraq in 2002, no bombing of Serbia and no war against Afghanistan, -- were it not for an abundant supply of worthless paper money, which are called U.S. dollars. Accepted as such all over the world â€” in reality they are pieces of paper issued by a private banking system, which cannot be exchanged for gold or silver. Why, in the words of the Encyclopedia Britannica, was it necessary to \"proceed cautiously?\" If this was an honest need why should there have been caution about the move? But the encyclopedia gives the nasty game of deception away in the words, \"that might excite the fears and suspicions of the public.\" By its own admission we now learn that there was a need for caution because base deception of the public was being engaged in and that the deception had to be \"skillfully contrived to provoke little opposition.\" What an admission that wholesale deception and gross fraud were being perpetrated on the people. The perpetrators very well knew that the people would go into revolt if they found out, so the Peel Amendment had to be disguised as \"highly beneficial changes.\" Who were the recipients of the \"highly beneficial changes?\" There was only one party who benefited and that was the Rothschild Dynasty and their banks all over the world. If this were not true, the \"highly beneficial changes\" would have been shouted from the rooftops of London and of"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 Dr. John Coleman every city in the world. But the \"highly beneficial changes\" were for the benefit of the Rothschild banking empire and not for the people of the many nations affected by it. While Sir Robert Peel presented the amendment to the bank's charter, its author was indeed Lionel Rothschild through his \"valet,\" Benjamin Disraeli, whom he had created and made famous as England's Prime Minister, in the manner in which the Rothschilds created and made famous Napoleon I. Lionel Rothschild's influence over the Bank of England had never waned since he frightened the bank into giving him de-facto control through this attack on its gold reserves, as explained earlier by demanding his paper be exchanged for his gold. It should be recalled that on August 4, 1847, when Disraeli's eligibility to run for a seat in Parliament was paper-thin, because he could not claim property ownership in fear of his many creditors, and property ownership being a necessary qualification, it was Baron Mayer de Rothschild, the High Sheriff of the county in which the town of Aylesbury was situated, who certified Disraeli as a qualified candidate and then declared him duly elected, after another candidate, a John Gibbs, had been persuaded to withdraw from the election. But the watching crowd did not take the result well. Perceiving Disraeli as an interloper, he was met with hisses and heckling. It is also worth mentioning, that while Disraeli was in such deep financial straits that could and would have badly affected his career in Parliament, it was Lionel de Rothschild who bought his debts and discharged them. The deal is mentioned in Disraeli by Weintraub, page 401: Through Philip Rose and Lionel de Rothschild, Montague discharged all debts. The Montague mentioned is said to have 'offered to buy up Disraeli's debts and charge a lower than usurious interest rate.' Critics suggested that the real"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 181 'purchaser' of Disraeli's debts was in fact, Lionel Rothschild. Another indisputable fact is, that in September 1848 the Rothschilds had a hand in buying Hughendon, Disraeli's country home for him through a front man, the Marquis of Titchfield. As Disraeli wrote to his wife Mary Anne, 'It is all done; you are the Lady of Hughendon'. I mention these facts, as they seem to bear out the claim that Disraeli was \"a mere valet of the Rothschilds.\" A study of the methods used by the Rothschilds to put over the deception of the Peel Amendment shows that they used in precisely the same way to put over the Federal Reserve Banks swindle on the American people. In both instances, the author and finisher of the plot were one and the same -- the Rothschilds. The catastrophe in 1840 was staged and managed by the Rothschilds to set the stage for the crucial amendment of 1844 that was to be so beneficial for the Rothschilds in that it ended the restraining influence of silver coinage and silver certificates. The Rothschilds stage-managed the panic of 1907 which opened the way for the American version of the Peel Amendment, the deceitful and downright unconstitutional Federal Reserve Banks, which bill was steered through the Senate by their numerous agents in place, notably Senator William Aldrich. The Peel Amendment and the Federal Reserve Act are twins of the same parentage, the Rothschilds, who used their front men and servants to conceal the real authors of these infamous fiscal and monetary measures of deception. How were the Rothschilds able to accomplish the double success that placed the yoke of slavery around the necks of the ordinary people? They did it by owning and"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182 Dr. John Coleman controlling the leaders of both political parties in the British Parliament and the political leaders of both parties in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Since then, nothing has changed. The status-quo remains entrenched. The two measures gave the Rothschilds complete control over the monetary and fiscal policies of the British Empire and the complete monetary and fiscal control over the United States, thereby multiplying not only Rothschild wealth, but Rothschild power to dictate policies to both the British and United States Governments, making them \"lord and master over the money markets of the world. Disraeli did not say that the Rothschilds achieved complete mastery of the foreign and domestic policies of the governments of the world, but this was hardly necessary to enunciate as it became self-evident at the Paris Peace Conference. On the instructions of their Rothschild masters, President Wilson and Prime Minister George organized two committees that were called the \"Financial Committee\" and the \"Economic Section.\" Rothschild agents Baruch and Thomas Lamont, a partner of J.P. Morgan and Co. were appointed to the Financial Committee. The net end result of the deliberations and decisions of the two committees made it almost impossible for Britain and France to repay their war debts to the United States, more than likely with the intention that they should be \"forgiven,\" which they were, in the most flagrant abuse of the U.S. Constitution. There were and are no provisions in the United States Constitution that would allow for loans and gifts to foreign powers, much less that debts should be written off. But to the Rothschilds it was just another hurdle to be overcome, and the U.S. did write off billions in debt owed by the Allies. The intention was quite clearly that the debts owing to the Rothschilds would be repaid and that was the bottom"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 183 line. Unfortunately, the Rothschild agents in the U.S. Government went along with the plan that robbed the American people of billions upon billions of dollars and enriched the Rothschilds with like amounts, this, in the most flagrant violation of the highest law of the United States, the Constitution. In its wake, the blatant disregard of the Constitution resulted in strengthening International Socialism that caused poverty and suffering, with revolutions that led to the rise of Communism. Who was this Disraeli, a man who had such a profound effect on the history of England? How did he aspire to his position of power? Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) who was given the title of Lord Beaconsfield in his later years was the first person of Jewish descent to become a prime minister of England. A study of documents in the British Museum, show that Disraeli owed his rise to fame and power solely to Lionel Rothschild. When he was discovered by Lionel, Disraeli was in a state of desperate poverty, but he still managed to rise to power and fame because Lionel Rothschild found him a useful servant. Bismarck, another of Rothschild's \"creations\" said that Disraeli was the originator of the plan to bring down the United States through civil war. The American Civil War was the most senseless fratricide ever in the history of the world, and cost the lives of nearly 800,000 men. It was a war that should never have happened, and would not have happened had it not been for the \"hidden hand\" of the Rothschilds and their agent, Disraeli, upon whose soul the blood of the dead of the Civil War must forever lie. Lionel Rothschild became Benjamin's mentor and guide.

Professor William Langer also does a more realistic job in assessing the worth of Disraeli, but none of these historians say anything at all about his mentor and controller, Lionel Rothschild. Cherep-Spiridovich is the least charitable of all toward Disraeli: The politics of Disraeli consisted chiefly in his hatred of Russia . . . Taken by Lionel under his guidance, Disraeli henceforth assumed a triumphant scorn, that which would be worthy of a Mephistopheles.

The Rothschilds needed Japan in their quest to destabilize Russia. Their hatred of the Romanov family was unbounded. The attack by the Japanese fleet on Port Arthur set the stage for the Bolshevik Revolution that was to follow in due time. As Lionel Rothschild once remarked, \"there has been no friendship between the Court of St. Petersburg and my family.\" The Russo-Japanese War began on February 8, 1904. The Communists were jubilant seeing in the attack a chance to strike a blow against the government. Russian newspapers like Novoye Vremyo charged that the Zionist Jews were secretly helping Japan. In this they were correct because Jacob Schiff was instrumental in floating several loans in favor of Japan. Schiff was tied to the Rothschilds through his birth in Frankfurt on January 10, 1847. His father was known to the Rothschilds. When he reached adulthood, Jacob became a broker for the Rothschild bank in Frankfurt. During 1865 the Rothschilds sent him to New York to connect up with the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188 Dr. John Coleman firm of Frank and Gans. Under the instructions of the Rothschilds he started his own brokerage house of Budge, Schiff and Co. in 1867. The partnership lasted for about six years and was dissolved in 1873 at which time Schiff went to Europe. After a tour of German banking firms in 1873 he returned to the United States in 1875, and was made a member of the banking firm Kuhn, Loeb and Co., a well known \"front\" for Rothschild banking interests in America. Schiff hated Russia and saw in a Russo-Japanese War the chance to strike a blow against the Tsars and perhaps bring about the end of their rule over Russia. By his express order, Kuhn, Loeb and Co., floated the three large Japanese war loans in 1904 and 1905. In appreciation he was awarded the Second Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan. After the decisive defeat of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur, the stage was set for the grave unrest in Russia that was to follow: July 28, 1904 Murder of Viacheslav von Plehve, the able minister of the interior August 22,1904 Jewish rioting erupted in Kiev, Rovno and Volhnia, continued to October January 22,1905 Bloody Sunday led by Rothschild agent \"Father\" Giorgi Gapon October 2-30,1905 A General Strike in which the whole country joined"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 189 December 22-January 1,1905-06 Insurrection of workers in Moscow May 2,1906 The dismissal of Count Witte, recognized by historians as the beginning of the end of the rule of the Romanov's The murder of von Plehve was predicted in a Jewish poem circulated in February 1904, addressed to \"Haman.\" Easily identified as the minister of the interior, it read that the \"new Haman\" would soon die. On the morning of July 28, 1904, a terrorist by the name of Sazonov threw a bomb at von Plehve as he stood in the square before the Warsaw depot in St. Petersburg. Just before the Bolshevik Revolution erupted, Schiff gave Lenin $20 million to further the Bolshevik cause. It is no wonder that Pope Leo XIII wrote in his Apostolic Letter of March 19, 1902, Parvenu a la Vingt-cinquieme Anee: Including most nations in its immense grip it unites itself with other sects of which the real inspiration and the hidden motive powers. It first attracts and then retains its associates by the bait of worldly advantage, which it secures for them. It bends governments to its will sometimes by promises, sometimes by threats. It has found its way into every class of society, and forms an invisible and irresponsible power, an independent government, as if it were within the body corporate of the lawful state.

The men that take part in these councils are not professional politicians or brilliantly- dressed ambassadors, but certain, unknown men, high financiers, who are superior to the vain ephemeral politicians who imagine that they govern the world. Before he was turned in favor of the conspirators, Winston Churchill remarked about events in Russia: The leading spirits of a formidable sect, the most formidable sect in the world, and with those spirits around him, set to work with a demoniacal ability to tear to pieces every institution upon which the Russian State depended. Russia was laid low. Russia had to be laid low. She was laid low in the dust. Churchill was referring to the diabolical fury of Lenin and Trotsky, and the terror and destruction they brought down on Christian Russia. (Speech in the House of Commons on Nov. 5, 1919) Lenin was but another valet of the Rothschilds sent to do their bidding. Their hatred for the Romanovs' knew no bounds. The one thing that infuriated the Rothschilds was the Tsar's attempt to form a Holy Empire that would acknowledge Christ as it leader. There are several accounts: The Jewish author A. Rappaport's book, The Curse of the Romanov's, Professor William Langer's account, John Spencer Bassett in The Lost Fruits of Waterloo and documents in Lord Milner's private papers. The Holy Alliance was considered a Christian League of Nations, Austria, Prussia, and Russia with the hope that Britain and France and all the nations of Europe would join. The nations were to swear an oath of allegiance to \"The One and Only True Sovereign, to whom alone, all power by divine right belongs, namely God, our Divine Savior, Jesus Christ.\""},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 191 The leading light in this hoped-for alliance was Tsar Alexander I who moved mightily to make it become a reality. The Rothschilds immediately expressed their opposition to it. Professor Langer defines it thusly, which in my opinion is a prejudiced account: On September 26, 1815, the Holy Alliance, a document drawn up by the Tsar Alexander I, signed by the Emperor Francis I and by Frederick William III and ultimately by all European rulers, excepting the prince regent of Britain, the pope, and the sultan of Turkey. It was an innocuous declaration of Christian principles, which were to guide the rulers in their relations with their subjects and with each other. These vague and unexceptionable principles were probably meant by the tsar as merely a preface to some form of international organization along the lines recommended by the Abbe de St. Pierre a century earlier. The importance of the document lay not in its terms, but in its later confusion in the public mind with the Quadruple Alliance and more particularly, with the reactionary policy of the three eastern powers which were regarded as bound by a pact directed against the liberties of the people, camouflaged as religion. In the first instance, it was not \"camouflaged as religion.\" That was the interpretation put upon it by the Rothschilds who did all they could to stop Britain from signing the document. In France, the Rothschilds were instrumental in getting the \"separation of Church and State\" to help to dissolve the Holy Alliance. Rappaport's book in this regard:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192 Dr. John Coleman The re-establishment of European peace has given to Czar Alexander I great satisfaction. Alexander directed his attention to the irreligiousness of the nations as the source of evils. He conceived the idea of reviving religious fervor in the peoples and thus re-establish a patriarchal regime, purity of family life, obedience to the law and authority. But the rulers must set an example and serve as models for their subjects. The sovereigns of Europe must carry out their missions as rulers of empires and kingdoms in the spirit of the founder of Christianity, which should be the link uniting the sovereigns to their peoples and among themselves. (Curse of the Romanov's, page 336) Apparently the Holy Alliance was at variance with the plans of the Rothschilds if we take into account the writings of Count Cherep-Spiridovich, who believed that from that moment on in 1815, the Rothschilds sealed the fate of Russia and the Romanov family. Cardinal Manning stated: An association has been formed for the express purpose of rooting out all the religions of the establishments and overturning all the governments of Europe. The cardinal believed that the first victim was France in the French Revolution and Russia was its second victim. There is evidence that Disraeli did not tell the truth about Russia. It was the Rothschilds, who fomented the Bolshevik Revolution and financed it through their New York banking fronts of Jacob Schiff and J.P. Morgan, and in London by Lord Alfred Milner. It is a fact that Schiff gave Trotsky $20 million for the task of overthrowing Christian Russia. The history of the Rothschilds shows that they did not hesitate to spend part of their huge fortune to achieve political goals. In this they achieved astonishing successes."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Rothschild Dynasty 193 That the Rothschilds held and exercised amazing power over nations and governments is born out by the following: The Kaiser had to consult Rothschild to find out whether he could declare war.
