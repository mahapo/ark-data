During the five monthsbetween May and October, a consensus for American independence emerged and wasofficially declared, the outlines for an American republic were first proposed,the problems that would shape its future were faced and finessed, and thelargest armada ever to cross the Atlantic arrived to kill the American rebellionin the cradle, which it then very nearly did.There are two intertwined strands to this story that are customarily told asstand-alone accounts in their own right. The first is the political tale of howthirteen colonies came together and agreed on the decision to secede from theBritish Empire. Here the center point is the Continental Congress, and theleading players, at least in my version, are John Adams, John Dickinson, ThomasJefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.The second is the military narrative of the battles on Long Island andManhattan, where the British army and navy delivered a series of devastatingdefeats to an American army of amateurs, but missed whatever chance existed toend it all. The focal point of this story is the Continental Army, and the majoractors are George Washington, Nathanael Greene, and the British brothers Richardand William Howe.My contention in the pages that follow is that the political and militaryexperiences were two sides of a single story, which are incomprehensible unlesstold together. They were both happening at the same time, events on one frontinfluenced outcomes on the other, and what most modern scholarship treatsseparately was experienced by the participants as one.More specifically, the political consensus that formed around Americanindependence in June and July was driven by a widespread loathing of the loomingBritish invasion at New York. And the commanders of both the British and theAmerican armies made battlefield decisions on multiple occasions based on theirperceived political impact on public opinion. The battles on Long Island andManhattan were political contests for hearts and minds more than militarymaneuvers for territory.Knowing the outcome of the American Revolution has also blinded us to theproblematic character of this intense moment, when everything was in thebalance, history was happening at an accelerating pace, and bothsides—especially the Americans—were improvising on the edge of catastrophe. Thedelegates in the Continental Congress and the officers in the Continental Armywere forced to make highly consequential decisions without knowing what theconsequences would be. In this compressed moment, they were living, as Adams putit, “in the midst of a Revolution,” which almost by definition meant that theywere making it up as they went along.Two articles of faith were also colliding. The first was that the British armyand navy were invincible, which turned out to be true. The second was that thecause of American independence, often referred to in semi-sacred incantations as“The Cause,” was inevitable, which turned out to be truer. Recovering thissupercharged moment as a historian necessarily entails seeing the choices asthey were perceived by the participants at the time, on both the American andthe British sides. But how we assess those choices is inescapably a function ofour privileged perch in the twenty-first century.For example, the Continental Congress made a deliberate decision to avoid anyconsideration of the slavery question, even though most delegates were fullyaware that it violated the principles they claimed to be fighting for. Adams ismost revealing on this score because, more than anyone else, he articulated theneed to defer the full promise of the American Revolution in order to assure arobust consensus on the independence question. Whether this was an admirablyrealistic decision in the Burkean tradition or a moral failure in the “justicedelayed is justice denied” mode is a question we cannot avoid asking, knowing aswe do how the next century of American history would play out.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#prf-nts1]To take another example, our recent experiences in Southeast Asia and the MiddleEast have prepared us to understand the dilemmas confronting armies ofoccupation in a distant land, facing an indigenous enemy with a revolutionaryagenda. The Howe brothers had the misfortune to encounter those conditions forthe first time in modern history, so they confidently assumed that theirmilitary superiority would prove decisive because they had no reason to believeotherwise. And from a conventional military point of view, at least tactically,their conduct of the New York campaign was a textbook example of a coordinatednaval and ground operation. But our perspective as a somewhat chastenedimperialistic power changes the core question. It was not “How could the Britishpossibly lose?” but rather “Was there any realistic chance for them to win?”2[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#prf-nts2]If such a chance ever did exist, it occurred in the summer of 1776, when theHowe brothers missed several opportunities to destroy the Continental Army onLong Island and Manhattan. Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weatherplayed crucial roles, as did the strategic and tactical decisions of the Howes,which came under considerable criticism after the war, when hindsight revealedthat their more measured and limited goals were rooted in a fundamentalmisreading of the challenges they were facing. There was disagreement within theAmerican camp at the time about the fate of the rebellion if the ContinentalArmy ceased to exist. We can never know, because it did not happen, though itwas a very close call. Hindsight does allow us to know that once the Howesmissed the opportunity to destroy the Continental Army early in the war, itwould never come again.So this is the story of the birth of the American Revolution, the pains andtribulations that accompanied that process, and the large and small decisions inboth the political and the military arenas that shaped the outcome. It is toldas a story, which means that narrative is presumed to be the highest form ofanalysis, and recovering the way it looked to the participants must precede anyimposition of our superior wisdom in the present.Before we begin our trek back to the past, two oddly shaped features of theterrain merit mention, chiefly because they do not align themselves with theexpectations we carry in our heads and therefore need to be marked on the mapbeforehand.The first is a distinctive sense of honor, a lingering vestige of the medievalworld that was still alive and pervasive, especially within the military cultureof the eighteenth century. The core concept in this quasi-chivalric code wascharacter, the notion that a clearly defined set of principles governed agentleman’s behavior at all times, most especially in highly stressful orlife-threatening situations. Men driven by this aristocratic sense of honorwould tend to behave in ways we consider strange, like standing at attention inthe face of a salvo of gunfire rather than lying down or seeking cover. Generalswould discuss strategic and tactical options on the battlefield in similarlypeculiar ways, because they regarded retreat as dishonorable and harmful totheir reputations. Washington is the most conspicuously honor-driven characterin our story, and his conduct throughout the Battle of New York is inexplicableunless viewed from this eighteenth-century perspective.The second place we need to mark on the map is actually an empty space. Becausewe know that the American Revolution eventually led to the creation of aconsolidated nation-state and subsequent world power, it is nearly irresistibleto read these future developments back into the story. But in truth, no sharedsense of American nationhood existed in 1776, even though the ContinentalCongress and the Continental Army can be regarded as embryonic versions of such.All alliances among the colonies, and then the states, were presumed to beprovisional and temporary arrangements. Allegiances within the far-flungAmerican population remained local, or at most regional, in scope. To presumeotherwise is to impose a level of political coherence on a much messier realityand to underestimate the dilemma that American leaders in the congress and thearmy were truly facing. They were attempting to orchestrate a collectiveresponse to multiple political and military challenges on behalf of an Americanpopulation that had yet to become the American people. In that sense, the veryterm American Revolution is misleading.With these cautionary signs in place, let us return to the late spring of 1776.An undeclared war has been raging for over a year, and a huge British fleet ispreparing to sail across the Atlantic to deliver a decisive blow that will crushthe American rebellion at its moment of birth. Meanwhile, the ContinentalCongress has not declared American independence because moderate delegatesregard war with Great Britain as suicidal, and it is not clear where theloyalties of most American colonists lie. The proverbial arrow is in the air,and it is clearly going to land at New York, the obvious target for the Britishinvasion. Whether there is a consensus on American independence is much lessclear, though John Adams claims to know where history is headed."},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 1[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]PRUDENCE DICTATES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Is it not a saying of Moses, “Who am I, that I should go in and out before thisgreat People?” When I consider the great events which are passed, and thosegreater which are rapidly advancing, and that I may have been instrumental intouching some Springs, and turning some small Wheels, which have had and willhave such Effects, I feel an Awe upon my Mind, which is not easily described.—JOHN ADAMS TO ABIGAIL ADAMS, May 17, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------By the spring of 1776, British and American troops had been killing each otherat a robust rate for a full year. While the engagements at Lexington and Concordhad been mere skirmishes, the battle at Bunker Hill had been a bloodbath,especially for the British, who lost more than 1,000 men, nearly half theirattack force. The American dead numbered in the hundreds, a figure inflated bythe fact that all the wounded left on the field were dispatched with bayonets byBritish execution squads enraged at the loss of so many of their comrades. Backin London, one retired officer was heard to say that with a few more victorieslike this, the British Army would be annihilated.Then, for the next nine months, a congregation of militia units totaling 20,000troops under the command of General George Washington bottled up a Britishgarrison of 7,000 troops under General William Howe in a marathon staring matchcalled the Boston Siege. The standoff ended in March 1776, when Washingtonachieved tactical supremacy by placing artillery on Dorchester Heights, forcingHowe to evacuate the city. Abigail Adams watched the British sail away fromnearby Penn’s Hill. “You may count upwards of 100 & 70 sail,” she reported.“They look like a forrest.” By then the motley crew of militia was beingreferred to as the Continental Army, and Washington had become a bona fide warhero.1 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts1]In addition to these major engagements, the British navy had made several raidson the coastal towns of New England, and an ill-fated expedition of 1,000American troops led by Benedict Arnold, after hacking its way through the Mainewilderness in the dead of winter, suffered a crushing defeat in the attempt tocapture the British stronghold at Quebec. Though most of the military action wasrestricted to New England and Canada, no reasonable witness could possibly denythat the war for American independence, not yet called the American Revolution,had begun.But if you widen the lens to include the Continental Congress in Philadelphia,the picture becomes quite blurry and downright strange. For despite the mountingcarnage, the official position of the congress remained abiding loyalty to theBritish Crown. The delegates did not go so far as to deny that the war washappening, but they did embrace the curious claim that George III did not knowabout it. Those British soldiers sailing away from Boston were not His Majesty’stroops but “ministerial troops,” meaning agents of the British ministry actingwithout the knowledge of the king.2[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts2]While everyone in the Continental Congress knew this was a fanciful fabrication,it was an utterly essential fiction that preserved the link between the coloniesand the crown and thereby held open the possibility of reconciliation. ThomasJefferson undoubtedly had these motives in mind when he crafted the followingwords a few months later: “Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments longestablished should not be changed for light and transient reasons; andaccordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer,while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms towhich they are accustomed.”3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts3]One might argue that those wounded American boys who were bayoneted to death onBunker Hill amounted to something more than light and transient reasons.Washington himself, once he learned of those atrocities, let it be known that hehad lost all patience with the moderates in the congress who were—it became oneof his favorite phrases—“still feeding themselves on the dainty food ofreconciliation.” Though he made a point of reminding all his subordinates thatthe army took its orders from the Continental Congress—civilian control was oneof those articles of faith that required no discussion—Washington did notbelieve he could send brave young men to their deaths for any cause less thanAmerican independence. That was what “The Cause” had come to mean for him andfor the army. His civilian superiors down in Philadelphia were straggling behindhim on the patriotic path, but Washington simply presumed that, sooner or later,they would catch up.4 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts4]In the meantime, however, during the final months of 1775, the military andpolitical sides of the American Revolution were not aligned. There were, ineffect, two embodiments of American resistance to British imperialism, twoepicenters representing the American response to Parliament’s presumption ofsovereignty. The Continental Army, under Washington’s command, regarded Americanindependence as a foregone conclusion, indeed the only justification for itsexistence. The Continental Congress regarded American independence as a lastresort, and moderate members under the leadership of John Dickinson fromPennsylvania continued to describe it as a suicidal act to be avoided at almostany cost.It was clear at the time, and became only clearer in retrospect, that theobvious strategy of the British government should have been to exploit the gapbetween these two positions by proposing some reconfiguration of the BritishEmpire that gave the American colonists a measure of control over their domesticaffairs in return for a renewed expression of American loyalty to the king. Twoyears later, the British ministry actually proposed just such an arrangement,but by then it was too late. Too many men had died or been maimed for life, toomany women had been raped, too many lives had been altered forever. Nothing lessthan complete American independence would do.HOW HAD IT COME to this? A comprehensive historical account would need to spendmany pages reviewing the constitutional arguments over the preceding decade thatbegan with the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765. A more succinct distillation ofpolitical history would cast the core of the constitutional argument as aconflict over the question of sovereignty. The seminal argument on the Britishside was most clearly and forcefully made by the great British jurist WilliamBlackstone, who, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765), insisted inhis most authoritative tone that there must in every state reside “a supreme,irresistible, absolute, uncontrolled authority, in which the jura summi imperii;or the rights of sovereignty reside.” In the British Empire, that supremeauthority was Parliament. Once you accepted this argument, it followed logicallyand necessarily that Parliament possessed the authority to levy taxes and makelaws for the American colonies.5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts5]The colonists had resisted that constitutional interpretation, resting theircase on the semi-sacred Whig principle that no British citizen could be taxed orrequired to obey any law that was passed without his consent. And since theAmerican colonists were not represented in Parliament, the statutes passed bythat body were not binding on them, who needed to obey only the laws passed bytheir own colonial legislatures.By the early 1770s, then, the argument had reached a logical and legal impassein which two conflicting views of the British Empire were forced to coexist: theresoundingly imperial view, in which sovereignty resided in Parliament; and theAmerican view, in which consent was the ultimate priority and sovereigntyresided in multiple locations, the only common American allegiance being to theking. The British model took its inspiration from European empires of the past,chiefly the Roman Empire. The American model had no precedents in the past, butforeshadowed what, a century later, became the British Commonwealth.In 1774 the British government decided that this impasse was intolerable, and inresponse to a wanton act of destruction in Boston Harbor called the Tea Party,it decided to impose martial law on Massachusetts. In retrospect, this was thecrucial decision, for it transformed a constitutional argument into a militaryconflict. And it raised to relief the competing visions of a British Empirebased on either coercion or consensus.But at the time—that is, early in 1775—voices on both sides of the Atlanticurged caution, fully aware that they had more to lose than to gain by a war andwholly committed to avoid it at all costs.On the British side, the arguments to change course came from two of the mostprominent members of Parliament. In the House of Lords, no less a leader thanWilliam Pitt, Earl of Chatham, the acknowledged architect of the British victoryin the French and Indian War, rose to condemn the decision to militarize theconflict. He recommended the withdrawal from Boston of all British troops, whocould only serve as incendiaries for a provocative incident that triggered awar. The British government should then negotiate a political settlement inwhich “the sacredness of their property remain[s] inviolate and subject to theirown consent.” Pitt was arguing that the American colonies were too valuable tolose, and that the British government would be well advised to give themeverything they were asking for.6 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts6]Edmund Burke rose in the House of Commons to make many of the same points,though Burke’s emphasis was on the Whig values that the American colonistsembraced and on the more menacingly coercive values that the British ministrywas advocating. As Burke saw it, the Americans had the better part of theargument, and if a war should ensue, they were likely to win. So the essence ofpolitical wisdom was to avoid such a war and the painful consequences it wouldentail.7 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts7]Pitt and Burke were two of the most eloquent and respected members ofParliament, and taken together, by early 1775, they were warning the Britishministry that it was headed toward a war that was unwise, unnecessary, andprobably unwinnable.Voices on the other side of the Atlantic also counseled caution and compromise.Within the Continental Congress, most of the moderate delegates came from themiddle colonies, chiefly Pennsylvania and New York. For at least two reasonsthis made excellent sense: first, the full wrath of British policy had beendirected at Massachusetts, and while the residents of Philadelphia and New Yorkfelt obliged to make common cause with their brethren in Boston, that feelingdid not translate into a willingness to be carried over the abyss into somebrave new world of American independence; second, the population of the middlecolonies was more diverse ethnically, politically, and religiously than NewEngland’s, more a demographic stew in which Germans, Scotch-Irish, and FrenchHuguenots coexisted alongside a Quaker elite to create a social chemistry thatput a premium on live-and-let-live toleration.8[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts8]As a result, the political as well as the seasonal climate was milder southwestof the Hudson. If the lingering vestiges of Calvinism gave New Englanders likeJohn Adams a sharp edge, prominent leaders in the middle colonies tended toresemble smooth stones that skipped across the surface of troubled waters. Itwas no accident that Benjamin Franklin would become the self-invented paragon ofbenevolent equanimity only after moving from Boston to Philadelphia.The epitome of this moderate mentality in the Continental Congress was JohnDickinson. Physically as well as psychologically, Dickinson was the opposite ofAdams: tall and gaunt, with a somewhat ashen complexion and a deliberatedemeanor that conveyed the confidence of his social standing in the Quaker eliteand his legal training at the Inns of Court in London. His early exposure to thecosmopolitan world of British society had convinced him that the British Empirewas a transatlantic family bound together by mutual interests and mutualaffections. Unlike Adams, who regarded Parliament’s efforts to impose taxes onthe colonies as a systematic plot to enslave them, Dickinson believed theseimpositions were temporary aberrations, merely another family quarrel, wavesthat would pass under the ship.9 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts9]During the early years of the imperial crisis, Dickinson was perhaps the mostprominent advocate for colonial rights within the empire, chiefly because of aseries of pamphlets titled Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer (1768), whichargued that Parliament not only lacked the authority to tax the colonists butalso could not regulate trade for the purpose of raising revenue. AlongsideAdams, he was generally regarded as the most impressive constitutional thinkeron the American side, and his selection as a delegate to the ContinentalCongress in 1774 was a foregone conclusion.But whereas Adams believed that the denial of Parliament’s authority mustinevitably lead to American withdrawal from the British Empire, Dickinson clungto the conviction that there must be some middle course that preserved colonialrights but averted American independence, which he regarded as an extremelydangerous course. The British were certainly not going to permit the coloniststo go in peace, which meant a war that the Americans could not hope to win:We have not yet tasted deeply the bitter Cup called Fortune of War … A bloodybattle lost … Disease breaking out among our troops unaccustomed to theConfinement of Encampment … The Danger of Insurrection by Negroes in theSouthern Colonies … Incidential Proposals to disunite … False hopes and selfishDesigns may all operate hereafter to our Disadvantage.10[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts10]This was not an unrealistic vision. (Indeed, everything that Dickinson foresawcame to pass.) There was every reason, then, to find a way out of the impasseshort of independence. And so, while Dickinson was resolute in his support ofthe beleaguered citizens of Massachusetts, to include the raising of money andmen for a Continental Army, his fondest hope was for the appointment of a peacecommission that would travel to London and negotiate some kind of sensiblecompromise.Though such a commission was never appointed, the outline of a Dickinsoniancompromise was reasonably clear. The British ministry would recognize thesovereignty of the colonial legislatures over all questions of taxation andlegislation. The colonists would voluntarily consent to Parliament’s regulationof trade, not for the purpose of raising a revenue but to ensure a privilegedcommercial relationship between the colonies and Great Britain. The colonistswould also profess their loyalty to the king and their desire to remain withinthe protective canopy of his paternal affection. It was, in effect, a return tothe status quo ante that existed in 1763, before the British ministry hadattempted to impose its misguided imperial reforms.11[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts11]As long as the imperial crisis remained a constitutional conflict, theDickinsonian compromise provided an eminently viable solution, indeed theobvious answer that British statesmen like Burke and Pitt were prepared toembrace. But once the fighting started in April 1775, and even more so afterBunker Hill, the shift from a constitutional to a military conflict altered thepolitical chemistry forever. Moderates on both sides of the Atlantic were sweptto the sidelines, and the obvious compromise became a casualty of war.12[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts12]Adams found Dickinson’s insistence on reconciliation in this new context bothmisguided and irritating. “A certain great Fortune and peddling Genius whoseFame has been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly cast to our whole Doings,”he scoffed in a private letter to a friend. When the British intercepted theletter and then saw to its publication, Adams was embarrassed, though heinsisted to friends that the controversy only exposed the futility ofDickinson’s vanishing hopes. For Dickinson’s moderate solution depended entirelyon a conciliatory king, and the events of late 1775 and early 1776 had shownconclusively that George III had no interest in playing that role.13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts13]MANY YEARS LATER, when John Adams was asked who deserved the lion’s share of thecredit for advancing the agenda toward independence in the Continental Congress,most of the questioners assumed that Adams would make a gesture of modesty, thenclaim the honor for himself. But he relished surprising them by bestowing theprize on George III. He was undoubtedly referring to the royal proclamationissued in August 1775 and the king’s address to both houses of Parliament thefollowing October.14 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts14]Apparently, George III was much shaken by the after-action reports on what wascalled “the ruinous victory” at Bunker Hill, which convinced him that events inthe American colonies had moved past the point where any political settlementshort of war was possible. And so he proclaimed the colonists to be in a stateof rebellion and no longer under his protection. Then he froze all Americanassets in Great Britain, closed all British ports to American ships, and urgedapproval of a massive task force to crush the incipient rebellion with onedecisive blow. In addition to 20,000 British regulars, he ordered therecruitment of another 10,000 mercenaries either from Russia or from thoseGerman principalities with professional soldiers trained in the highlydisciplined tradition of Frederick the Great. When news of this last initiativereached America, Adams could not resist commenting on it with his customaryirreverence. “By Intelligence hourly arriving from abroad,” he wrote one friend,“we are more and more confirmed that a Kind of Confederation will be formedamong the Crowned Skulls, and Numbskulls of Europe, against Human Nature.”15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts15]By the start of the new year, then, George III had single-handedly underminedthe reconciliation agenda of the moderate faction in the congress. For themoderates had invested all their hopes in a wise and loving monarch whosepaternal affection for his American subjects would eventually bring thewarmongers in the ministry and Parliament to their senses. Now George III haddemonstrated that he was perhaps the most ardent advocate for war in the Britishgovernment. The king had seized the initiative himself, and his adviserspromptly lined up behind their sovereign. While the moderates were busy blockingany declaration of American independence from the British Empire, George III hadin effect issued his own declaration of independence from them.The final blow to the prospect of a political accommodation—almost a coup degrâce, given the recent news from London—came in the form of a fifty-pagepamphlet by an anonymous author titled Common Sense, which appeared in January1776. Both the style and the substance of Common Sense were true to its title,since it was written in an idiom that was both accessible and electric,replicating the vocabulary of conversations by ordinary American in taverns andcoffeehouses, where intricate constitutional arguments were replaced withstraightforward assertions that “an island cannot rule a continent.” CommonSense was also a frontal attack on monarchy itself, poking fun at the ludicrousclaim that the king spoke directly to God, describing the royal lineage as acriminal lineup of banditti, dismissing the notion that George III cared a whitabout his American subjects as a fairy tale, or perhaps as a sentimental dreamfrom which all responsible citizens needed to awake. The timing of Common Sensewas perfect, for it provided a blanket indictment of British royalty in generaland George III in particular just as the news of his plan to launch an enormousinvasion began circulating in the American press. The pamphlet’s style, message,and timing combined to make it a sensation that sold 150,000 copies within threemonths.16 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts16]The author, it turned out, was a thirty-nine-year-old Englishman named ThomasPaine, who had taken up residence in Philadelphia only two years earlier.Nothing in Paine’s background marked him as a candidate for greatness. He hadfailed as a shopkeeper, husband, and corset maker in Lewes and London, though hehad internalized a keen sense of British injustice based on his experience as amember of London’s impoverished working class. As for his dazzling prose style,it was like a beautiful woman’s beauty, a God-given gift that was simply there.Since no one had ever heard of Paine, and since John Adams was the most visibleand outspoken advocate for American independence, Adams was initially identifiedas the author of Common Sense. “I am innocent of it as a Babe,” Adams retorted.“I could not reach the Strength and Brevity of his style. Nor his elegantSimplicity nor his piercing Pathos.”17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts17]There were some features of Common Sense that Adams found troubling, chieflyPaine’s prescription of a large, single-house legislature as the proper form ofgovernment once the colonies had thrown off British rule. Paine struck Adams as“better at tearing down than building up.” But since the colonies were still inthe “tearing down” phase of their relationship with George III and the BritishEmpire, Common Sense was a highly visible and valuable contribution to “TheCause.” In part because of its influence, by the spring of 1776 support for anAmerican declaration of independence had moved from a minority to a majorityposition in the congress. What remained unclear was the political opinion in themiddle colonies, especially in the loyalist and moderate strongholds of New Yorkand Pennsylvania.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts18]THE MAN WHO, more than anyone else, would shape the answer to that question wasJohn Adams, who had emerged as the leader of the radical faction in theContinental Congress. He did not look the part. By the time he turned forty-onein 1776, he was already losing his teeth and what remained of his hair. At fivefoot six he was shorter than most males of his time, with a torso that hisenemies compared to a cannonball and that eventually led to the label “HisRotundity.” As a young man fresh out of Harvard, he began keeping a diary thatmade frequent references to the “raging bulls” he felt galloping through hissoul. These interior surges periodically took the form of dramatic mood swingsthat declined but never wholly disappeared after his marriage to Abigail Smithin 1764, leaving an impression among friends and foes alike that he was, onoccasion, slightly out of control. It was no accident that the beau ideal of hispolitical philosophy was balance, since he projected onto the world theconflicting passions he felt inside himself and regarded government as thebalancing mechanism that prevented those factions and furies from spinning outof control.19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts19]Adams entered the Continental Congress in 1774 already convinced that GreatBritain’s imperial agenda left little room for negotiation or accommodation. Thepassage of the Coercive Acts (1774), which imposed martial law on Massachusetts,had pushed him over the line toward independence, and once beyond thatformidable barrier, he never looked back. “I had passed the Rubicon,” herecalled. “Swim or sink, live or die, survive or perish with my country was myunalterable determination.”20 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts20]Adams was early to “The Cause” at least in part because he was looking for it.This, after all, was a young man who stood before mirrors practicing Cicero’soration against Catiline, perfecting his body language and facial expressions toachieve the most dramatic effect. The constitutional crisis with Great Britainrepresented a providential opportunity to lash his enormous ambitions to a causelarger than himself and to a calling that would catapult him beyond theprovincial horizons of a Boston lawyer to heights that were truly historic. Hehad been auditioning for the role of American Cicero in the privacy of his ownmind for nearly a decade. Now a handful of incompetents in the British ministry,with an able assist from George III, had handed him a script eventually to betitled “The American Revolution.” He was poised to play a starring role.21[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts21]From the very start, he alienated his moderate colleagues in the ContinentalCongress by telling them that the centerpiece of their strategy toward GreatBritain—reconciliation on the basis of some kind of shared power with Parliamentor some benevolent intervention by the king—was an illusion: “I have reasoned, Ihave ridiculed, I have fretted and declaimed against this fatal Delusion,” helamented. “But a Torrent is not to be impedded by Reasoning, nor a Storm allayedby Ridicule.” For the moderates, who in 1774 and 1775 were a substantialmajority in the congress, independence meant war with the greatest militarypower on the planet, which was unthinkable. On the contrary, Adams replied;whatever the consequences might be, independence was inevitable. “We shall beconvinced eventually that the cancer is too deeply rooted,” he predicted, “andtoo far spread to be cured by anything short of cutting it out entirely.” As heput it to Abigail, “We are waiting for a Messiah … who will never come.”22[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts22]Adams acknowledged that he had made himself obnoxious to many of his colleagues,who regarded him as a one-man bonfire of the vanities. This never troubledAdams, who in his more contrarian moods claimed that his unpopularity providedclinching evidence that his position was principled, because it was obvious thathe was not courting popular opinion. His alienation, therefore, was a measure ofhis integrity. Most frustrating to his opponents, events kept aligningthemselves in accord with his predictions—this was why he gave George III somuch credit as an indispensable ally—thereby reinforcing his claim to know wherehistory was headed.Ironically, by the early spring of 1776, when events came his way in waves(i.e., George III’s rejection of political reconciliation in favor of war, thesensational impact of Common Sense), Adams had begun to sound a more cautiousnote. Despite his bravado in denouncing popularity and his ridicule of moderatedelegates as hopelessly naïve, he worried that the accelerating pace of themovement for American independence had gotten too far ahead of popular opinion.Paine’s pamphlet had certainly helped “The Cause” on this score, but it was notat all clear that the majority of Americans, especially in the middle colonies,were ready for a break with the crown. The former firebrand became the prudentmanager of revolutionary energies, dedicated not to speeding up the politicalprocess but to slowing it down. The American colonies were “advancing by slowbut sure steps, to that mighty Revolution”—on that crucial point he remainedconfident—but “forced Attempts to accellerate their Motions would be attendedwith Discontent and perhaps Convulsions.”23[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts23]Despite his well-earned reputation as a flaming radical, Adams now showed histrue colors as that rarest of beasts, a conservative revolutionary. Whilecompletely committed to secession from the British Empire, he thought there hadto be a conspicuous consensus within the American citizenry for the revolutionto succeed. And popular opinion needed to “ripen on the vine” before thatconsensus became convincingly clear. Moreover, the transition from Britishcolonies to American states must occur seamlessly rather than traumatically. “Ihave ever Thought it the most difficult and dangerous Part of the Business,” hewarned, “to contrive some Method for the colonies to glide insensibly from underthe old Government, into a peaceable and contented Submission to new ones.” Hewanted to orchestrate, if you will, an evolutionary revolution, to control theexplosion. His voracious reading of history was not much help, since it showedthat no one else who had tried to do this had ever succeeded.24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts24]ADAMS SAW HIMSELF as the responsible revolutionary who would defy thathistorical pattern. In the current context, that meant establishing a newpolitical framework for the American colonies before independence was officiallydeclared. Abigail had already anticipated the problem with a series of pointedquestions: “If we separate from Great Britain, what code of laws will beestablished? How shall we be governed so as to retain our liberties? Can anygovernment be free which is not administered by general laws? Who shall framethese laws? Who will give them force and energy?” For unless new politicalinstitutions were already in place, Americans ran the risk of escaping thetyranny of the British Empire for a homegrown version of anarchy.25[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts25]Throughout the spring of 1776, as he allowed the idea of independence to“ripen,” Adams focused his fullest energies on devising the framework of anAmerican government after independence. A proper sequence of events that he sawin his mind’s eye would ensure a seamless transition from British rule to astable American republic. “The colonies should all assume the Powers ofGovernment in all its Branches first”; then, after they had revised their ownconstitutions along republican lines, “they should confederate with each other,and define the Powers of Congress next.” Only after each of these steps had beencompleted should a public declaration of independence be made. Events were aboutto make a mockery of this orderly scheme, but it accurately reflected Adams’sdeep desire to control the explosive energies released by the repudiation ofBritish authority. Before they leaped, the colonies needed to know where theywould land.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts26]The first task, then, was for each colony to revise its own government in accordwith republican principles. Because he was regarded as one of the leadingconstitutional thinkers in the congress, Adams was asked by delegates from threecolonies—North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey—to provide his wisdom.Adams drafted three memoranda for that purpose in late March and early April. Hethen decided to write a fourth draft for publication in order to make his adviceavailable to all the colonies. Titled Thoughts on Government, it appeared in thePennsylvania Packet on April 22.27[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts27]Though Adams later dismissed Thoughts as “a mere sketch” that was “done inhaste,” it represented his attempt to propose a thoroughly republicanizedversion of the English “mixed Constitution.” Each state government should becomprised of three parts, on the English model of executive, bicamerallegislature, and judiciary. But instead of a hereditary monarch, it would havean elected governor, and instead of a hereditary House of Lords, it would havean elected upper house or senate—a clear statement that political power flowedupward from its primal source in “the people” rather than downward from theking.He was especially eager to oppose Thomas Paine’s prescription in Common Sensefor a huge single-house legislature that purportedly embodied the will of “thepeople” in its purest form. For Adams, “the people” was a more complicated,multivoiced, hydra-headed thing that had to be enclosed within differentchambers. He regarded Paine’s belief in a harmonious and homogeneous popularcollective just as delusional as the belief in a divinely inspired monarch.Lurking within the Adams formulation was an early version of two overlappingprinciples—checks and balances and separation of powers—that would become corefeatures of the federal Constitution eleven years later.28[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts28]There were many possible models for a republic, Adams was quick to observe, andthe version he proposed in Thoughts ought not to be regarded as cast in stone.Different colonies had different histories and different traditions. Each oughtto take from Thoughts what best fit its own political experience, wheneverpossible producing a republicanized adaptation of the old constitution in orderto minimize the sense of change and maximize continuity.A formal resolution by the congress to implement the Adams proposal for newstate constitutions to replace the colonial constitutions sanctioned under theauthority of the British Crown was approved on May 12. Adams described it as“the most important resolution that was ever taken in America.” Three days laterhe added a preface that, in both form and content, made the resolution a giantstep toward independence.29 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts29]The preface began with a list of grievances against the king, emphasizing hisrejection of the colonists’ petitions for redress of grievances, then hisdecision to assemble “the whole force of that kingdom, aided by foreignmercenaries, to be exerted for the destruction of the good People of theseColonies.” (This was the first time that an official document of the congresshad implicated the king as an accomplice in the conflict.) It then followed thatall British laws “and every kind of authority under the said crown should betotally suppressed,” and that the people of the United Colonies should fill thevoid with governments of their own making, “exerted under the authority of thepeople of the colonies for the preservation of internal peace, virtue and goodorder; as well as for the defence of their lives, liberties, and propertiesagainst the hostile invasions and cruel depredations of their enemies.”30[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts30]Adams immediately sensed that something truly historic had just happened. Twodays later, on May 17, he wrote Abigail, brimming over with pride that he hadjust assured himself a page in the history books:Is it not a saying of Moses, “Who am I, that I should go in and out before thisgreat People?” When I consider the great events which are passed, and thosegreater which are rapidly advancing, and that I may have been instrumental intouching some Springs, and turning some small Wheels, which have had and willhave such Effects, I feel an Awe upon my Mind which is not easily described.31[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts31]Over the ensuing years, Adams liked to claim that the resolution of May 15 wasthe real declaration of independence, and that Jefferson’s more famousdeclaration six weeks later was a merely ceremonial afterthought. In effect, thelightning had already struck in May, and the July document was only a thunderousepilogue. This argument over authorship, over who deserved the credit forcarrying the colonies “across the Rubicon,” distorts the complicated context ofthe political situation that existed in the late spring of 1776. Adams wascertainly correct that the resolution of May 15 was a major step towardindependence, and the fierce debate in the Continental Congress preceding thevote makes it clear that the delegates understood that, with passage of thisresolution, there would be no turning back. Negative votes by the delegates fromNew York and Pennsylvania also showed that independence remained controversialwithin the congress.If only in retrospect, the political crisis had reached the point of no return.For ten years (1765–75) the American colonists had engaged in a constitutionalduel over the powers of Parliament, initially rejecting its authority to taxthem, eventually opposing its authority to legislate for them at all. Theoutbreak of hostilities in the spring of 1775 had altered the politicalchemistry of the constitutional debate, leaving the connection with the king thelast remaining link to the British Empire. Now George III’s hostile andaggressive actions severed that last link, effectively ending any realisticprospect of a negotiated political settlement. Both the resolution of May andthe more famous declaration of July, then, were rhetorical responses to anonnegotiable political crisis that had already moved from the diplomatic desksof London and Philadelphia to the battlefield, which turned out to be New York.In April, Washington had moved the Continental Army to that location on thepresumption, correct as it turned out, that the British invasion would happenthere. Military events were dictating political decisions.32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts32]That said, the resolution of May 15 was distinctive, and different fromJefferson’s later manifesto, in one significant sense. For it was not just arejection of British authority but also an assertion of the need to create stategovernments to replace discredited British rule. In that sense, it was aninvitation to declare what an independent American republic, or confederation ofrepublics, should look like. Adams was reasonably confident that the formercolonies would unite behind the call to independence and draft new stateconstitutions along the lines he had suggested. Beyond that, however, he wasworried that he had lifted the lid of Pandora’s box and that the most ardentadvocates of independence would attempt to implement a truly revolutionaryagenda. He could only hold his breath and wait, but he had reason to fear thatthe war for independence would actually become the American Revolution.33[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts33]THAT FEAR WAS well-founded, indeed rooted in the very logic of theconstitutional arguments that Adams and his fellow patriots had been hurling atParliament for more than a decade. For at its core, the colonists’ argumentinsisted that all political power was arbitrary and illegitimate unless itenjoyed the consent of the governed. And once consent was established as thenonnegotiable essence of any republic worthy of the name, lights began to go onup and down the line, illuminating several dark corners of American societyinhabited by groups that could claim, with considerable plausibility, that theywere being denied their rights without their consent.Slavery was the most blatant contradiction of everything the budding AmericanRevolution claimed to stand for. It required herculean feats of denial not tonotice that 20 percent of the American population, about 500,000 souls, wereAfrican Americans, and that fully 90 percent of them were slaves, the vastmajority residing south of the Potomac. Adams received several requests to placethis glaring anomaly on the agenda of the Continental Congress from petitionerswho claimed that failure to address this issue would expose the entire caseagainst British tyranny as fraudulent and hypocritical.An anonymous petitioner from Virginia put the problem most succinctly: “Is itnot incompatible with the glorious Struggle America is making for her ownLiberty, to hold in absolute Slavery a Number of Wretches, who will beurged … to become the most inveterate Enemies of their present Masters?” Adamsreceived perhaps the most poignant plea from a barely literate Pennsylvanian whostyled himself “Humanity”: “What has the negros the afracons don to us that weshud tak them from thar own land and mak them sarve us to the da of thardeath …? God forbit that it shud be so anay longer.”34[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts34]An even larger disenfranchised group, the entire female population, couldneither vote nor own property if they were married. And the chief petitioner forwomen’s rights was none other than the ever saucy Abigail Adams. On March 31,1776, in the midst of a newsy letter that touched on several differenttopics—the effects of the smallpox epidemic in Boston, the crops she intended toplant in their garden—Abigail unburdened herself in what became one of the mostfamous “by the ways” in American letters:And, by the way, in the New Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessaryfor you to make, I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generousand favourable to them than your ancestors.… Remember all Men would be tyrantsif they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we aredetermined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Lawsin which we have no Voice, or Representation.35[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts35]This was a petition that Adams could not afford to ignore. He responded in ajocular tone, suggesting that Abigail’s proposal was intended as a playful pieceof mischief. “We know better than to repeal our Masculine systems,” he joked,“which would completely subject Us to the Despotism of the Petticoat.” Severalvolleys went back and forth between Braintree and Philadelphia, in which Abigailacknowledged that she was being playful but was also deadly serious in herinsistence that the very arguments her husband was deploying against thearbitrary power of Parliament had profound implications for the status of womenin an independent American republic. “But you must remember,” she concluded inher final volley, “that arbitrary Power is like most things that are veryhard … and notwithstanding all your wise laws and maxims, we have in our Power,not only to free ourselves, but to subdue our Masters, and without violence,throw your natural and legal authority at your feet.”36[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts36]Just two weeks before Abigail launched her broadside on behalf of women’srights, an editorial appeared in the Pennsylvania Evening Post in which yetanother disenfranchised group, the working-class artisans and mechanics ofPhiladelphia, describing themselves as “men who wear leather aprons,” protestedthe long-standing property requirement to vote: “Do not mechanics and farmersconstitute ninety-nine out of a hundred people of America? If these, by theiroccupations are to be excluded from having any share in the choice of theirrulers or forms of government, would it not be best to acknowledge thejurisdiction of the British Parliament?”37[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts37]For the past two years, a large number of working-class residents ofPhiladelphia had become actively involved in the various revolutionaryorganizations and committees that seized control of the city government. Not soincidentally, the arrival of Thomas Paine gave this group an eloquent new voice,which took as its clarion call the obvious injustice of the property requirementto vote. For them, citizenship was not a privilege to be enjoyed only by thosewith landed wealth, but a right of every adult male, vested in his person ratherthan in his property.In April 1776 Adams received a letter from James Sullivan, a prominent NewHampshire patriot, who was having similar thoughts. Sullivan claimed to besurprised at the conclusion he had reached, but the logic of the Americanargument against British imperialism carried him to a place that only a fewyears earlier he would have considered alien territory: “Laws and Government arefounded on the Consent of the People.… Why a man is supposed to consent to theacts of a Society of which in this respect he is an absolute Excommunicate, nonebut a lawyer well Labeled in the feudal Sistem can tell.”38[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts38]Already reeling from Abigail’s salvo on behalf of women, Adams could onlycaution Sullivan that his case for broadening the electorate would havecatastrophic consequences. “There will be no end to it,” Adams warned, “andevery Man, who has not a Farthing, will demand an equal Voice with any other inall Acts of State.” Sullivan could only reply that, yes, it was a strange newworld we were creating, but it followed naturally and inevitably from therepublican principles that Americans claimed to stand for.39[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts39]Hindsight allows us to see that in the space of a very few months, the entireliberal agenda for the next century was inserted into the politicalconversation. It was, in effect, a preview of coming attractions. But for Adams,the most prominent presence in this superheated moment, the all-important itemon the current American agenda, was independence from Great Britain. And if thatfailed, all the other political goals became meaningless pipe dreams.Obsessed as he was with controlling the pace of the movement for independence,Adams now feared that the debates about to occur in the separatecolonies-cum-states as they drafted new constitutions would get sidetracked by amore far-reaching political agenda that would make consensus on the corequestion of independence impossible. The chief threat on this score was slavery,since once it entered the discussion, every state south of the Potomac wouldhave second thoughts about independence. Adams believed that the debate aboutthe kind of republic America wished to become must be postponed until after thewar for independence had succeeded. Raising such controversial issues now waslike stopping your racehorse a few yards from the finish line in order to engagein a debate about the size of the winner’s purse.But the very resolution of May 15 that made Adams so proud essentially requiredeach of the thirteen colonies to conduct a debate on independence that couldeasily fall victim to different notions about the future character of anindependent American republic. And there was really nothing that Adams could doabout it. For in the end, an aspiring republic had only one way to resolve suchweighty questions, and that was to surrender control to the people out there inall those towns, villages, and farms. This was not easy for Adams, who harboredno illusions about the preternatural wisdom of the common man. But he really hadno choice. The British government had made a top-down decision in themonarchical way to smash the American rebellion with an overwhelming display ofmilitary power, currently poised to cross the Atlantic and deliver the decisiveblow. The Continental Congress had made a bottom-up decision in the republicanway to conduct an open-ended referendum on American independence and what itmeant. It was a much messier way of proceeding, but it was also true to theprinciples the colonists claimed to stand for.And so, as summer approached, all the revolutionary ingredients, like pieces ofa puzzle, were falling into place. George Washington had just moved theContinental Army down from Boston to New York, where the British task force wasexpected to strike. The largest fleet ever to cross the Atlantic was assemblingin several British ports under the command of Admiral Richard Howe, olderbrother of William Howe, who himself was coming down from Halifax with the sevenregiments that Abigail Adams had watched sail out of Boston Harbor three monthsearlier. The legislatures of all the colonies were gathering to revise theirconstitutions and register their opinions on independence.Only John Adams was not in motion, though his thoughts and emotions were racinginside him as he watched the gathering storm from his post in Philadelphia. OnMay 14 he was joined by a somewhat obscure delegate from Virginia named ThomasJefferson, reporting for duty again after tending to his ailing wife at hishilltop estate in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Though Jeffersondid not know it at the time—nor, for that matter, did anyone else—he was thefinal piece of the puzzle."},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 2[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]OF ARMS AND MEN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have often thought how much happier I should have been if, instead ofaccepting a command under such Circumstances, I should have taken my musket uponmy Shoulder & entered the Ranks or … had retir’d to the back country & lived ina Wig-wam.—GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOSEPH REED, January 14, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Although American independence was still not officially declared by the latespring of 1776, it already had a martyr and a hero. The martyr was JosephWarren, a local physician who was marked as a rising star in Boston politics andwho also just happened to be the doctor for the Adams family. Warren had bravelystood his ground at Bunker Hill until the redcoats overwhelmed his redoubt; hehad been shot in the back of the head as he turned to escape, and then his deadbody had been bayoneted by several British soldiers caught up in the heat of thebattle. The next day, an execution squad that was finishing off the Americanwounded made a point of decapitating Warren and displaying his head on a spit,thereby ensuring his martyrdom.1 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts1]The hero was George Washington, the commander in chief of the haphazardcollection of militia units now being referred to as the Continental Army. Oversix feet tall and just over two hundred pounds, Washington was a physicalspecimen produced by some eighteenth-century version of central casting. (Thereis an ongoing scholarly debate about Washington’s height. In his instructions tohis tailor, he described himself as six feet tall. Fellow officers in the Frenchand Indian War described him as six foot two. Measurements of his corpse for hiscoffin list him at six foot three and a half.) Adams had been the one tonominate him as American military commander in June 1775, later explaining thathe was the obvious choice, in part because he was a Virginian and Virginia’ssupport for the still-undeclared war was critical, and in part because he was afull head taller than anyone else in the room.2[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts2]Although the Boston Siege was really less a battle than a prolonged tacticalminuet in which the Americans enjoyed a three-to-one superiority in manpower,the fact that the British Army eventually sailed away to fight another day wasregarded in the American press as a major victory. And the obvious symbol ofthis triumph was Washington. Not only did Harvard grant him an honorary degree,but the Massachusetts General Court issued a statement predicting that monumentswould be constructed in his name. And the Continental Congress ordered a goldmedal cast to commemorate his triumph. John Hancock, the president of thecongress, explained what the medal was intended to celebrate: “Those Pages inthe Annals of America, will record your Title to a conspicuous Place in theTemple of Fame, which shall inform Posterity that under your Directions, anundisciplined Band of Husband men, in the Course of a few Months, becameSoldiers [and then defeated] an Army of Veterans, commanded by the mostexperienced Generals.”3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts3]So there it was. The widespread apprehension that the British Army wasinvincible had just been disproved. Not only was the British fleet sailing awayin defeat and disgrace, but the formula for American military success had nowbeen discovered. Rank amateurs who believed in the cause they were fighting forcould defeat British veterans who were fighting for pay—that is, if theAmericans were commanded by a natural leader who proved himself capable oftapping the bottomless well of patriotism in his citizen-soldiers. Washingtonwas obviously that man, now the one-man embodiment of “The Cause.”As he headed south from Boston with slightly less than 10,000 troops to opposethe presumed British attack at New York, Washington was greeted with parades,multiple toasts to “His Excellency,” and the kind of spontaneous publicadulation that would become commonplace throughout the rest of his life. If allsuccessful revolutions require heroes, and they do, the American Revolution haddiscovered its larger-than-life personality around whom to rally.Washington not only fit the bill physically, he was also almost perfectpsychologically, so comfortable with his superiority that he felt no need toexplain himself. (As a young man during the French and Indian War, he had beenmore outspoken, but he learned from experience to allow his sheer presence tospeak for itself.) While less confident men blathered on, he remained silent,thereby making himself a vessel into which admirers poured their fondestconvictions, becoming a kind of receptacle for diverse aspirations thatmagically came together in one man. All arguments about what independence stoodfor ceased in his presence. As the toasts to Washington put it, he “unites allhearts.”4 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts4]Beneath this magisterial veneer, however, Washington himself harbored seriousdoubts about the assumptions underlying Hancock’s uplifting assessment, chieflyhis confidence in the military prowess of an army of amateurs. During the BostonSiege, he had unburdened himself on several occasions on this very point. “Toexpect then the same Service from Raw, and undisciplined Recruits as fromVeteran Soldiers,” he warned, “is to expect what never did, and perhaps neverwill happen.” Patriotism was an indispensable ingredient, no question, but itwas not an adequate substitute for military discipline and experience. What noone seemed to notice was that the triumph at the Boston Siege had been achievedwithout a major battle. In that sense, the Continental Army was still untested.And Washington was uncertain that it would perform with equivalent success whenconfronted by the full power of the British Army in New York. If he had knownwhat the British intended to throw at him there, he would have been moreskeptical.5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts5]Here, for the first time, an underlying contradiction that in fact was neverwholly resolved began to take shape. (In Washington’s mind, it was the shape ofa satanic specter.) Namely, the very values that the American patriots claimedto be fighting for were incompatible with the disciplined culture required in aprofessional army. Republics were committed to a core principle of consent,while armies were the institutional embodiments of unthinking obedience androutinized coercion. The very idea of a “standing army” struck most members ofthe Continental Congress and the state legislatures as a highly dangerous threatto republican principles. And yet, at least as Washington saw it, only aprofessional army in the British mode could win a war that then permitted thoserepublican principles to endure. At least logically, this dilemma was insoluble,an ends-means problem of the most dramatic kind. Even at the rhetorical level,it was never really resolved so much as obscured beneath the glittering gloss ofthe Washington mystique. Because he was the universally recognized symbol of allthe American cause claimed to stand for, any army that he commanded was, bydefinition, republican in character. Thomas Jefferson was about to declare somerather significant self-evident truths of his own, but for now, and in fact forthe entire war, Washington was the towering self-evident truth on horseback,indispensable because he rendered all argument unnecessary.WHAT WASHINGTON KNEW, having learned it over and over again during thenine-month-long Boston Siege, was that the Continental Army he was leading downthe coast through Rhode Island and Connecticut to New York was neithercontinental in character nor an army in anything like the professional sense ofthe term.6 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts6]On the first score, over 90 percent of his troops were New Englanders. This madeperfect sense, given that the initial military actions had all occurred in andaround Boston; the militia units that rallied to “The Cause” were overwhelminglyvolunteers from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. Moreover, ifpatriotism had a temperature, the hottest region in the American colonies wasNew England, where political indifference in many towns and villages wasstigmatized as treasonable behavior. Outright expressions of loyalty to thecrown were severely punished with tar and feathers in the town square, mobs thattore down and burned your house, and public notices of your imminent demise. Notfor nothing did the British ministry regard New England as the cradle of therebellion.7 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts7]But if the army was the clearest expression of American resistance andpatriotism, the hegemonic presence of New Englanders raised serious questionsabout the level of political commitment in the middle and southern colonies.Washington was acting on the presumption that he was leading a consolidatedAmerican effort to withdraw from the British Empire, but no political statementto that effect had yet been sanctioned by the Continental Congress. Despite theconfidence that Washington projected as he rode through Providence, New London,and New Haven, it was still unclear whether the colonies south and west of theHudson would rally to “The Cause” in the manner of the New Englanders.The army marching behind Washington might charitably have been called a work inprogress. It represented the enduring remnant of the militia units that hadformed around Boston the preceding summer and then become incorporated into whatwas now being called the Continental Army. In fact, most of the men with farmsand families, the prototypical yeomen farmers, had gone home to till theirfields and resume their role as state militia. The troops who stayed representedthe bottom rung of the social ladder—former indentured servants; recent Irishimmigrants; unemployed artisans, blacksmiths, and carpenters—who stayed becausethey had nowhere else to go. What Washington called “the soldiery” of theContinental Army was a motley crew of marginal men and misfits, most wearinghunting shirts instead of uniforms, spitting tobacco every ten paces, alldefiantly confident that they had just humiliated the flower of the British Armyat Boston and would soon do the same at New York. Free-spirited, rough-hewn, andfull of youthful vigor, they were not the kind of men you wanted living in yourneighborhood.They had driven Washington to the edge of exasperation for the past nine months,resisting most forms of military discipline, relieving themselves wherever andwhenever the spirit moved them, and mocking their junior officers, whom in manycases they had elected and regarded as their representatives rather than theirsuperiors. “I have often thought,” Washington confessed to a trusted aide, “howmuch happier I should have been if, instead of accepting a command under suchCircumstances, I should have taken my musket upon my Shoulder & entered theRanks or … had retir’d to the back country & lived in a Wig-wam.”8[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts8]On several occasions, when Washington had recommended an assault on the Britishdefenses in Boston, all the general officers, meeting in councils of war, hadconvinced him that the troops lacked the discipline and unit cohesion to conductan offensive operation. They were simply too inexperienced. (The average lengthof service in the Continental Army was less than six months. In the British Armyit was seven years.) Washington eventually, if reluctantly, accepted thelimitations imposed by the kind of troops he was commanding and adjusted histactics accordingly: “Place them behind a Parapet—a Breast Work—Stone Wall … andthey will give a good Acct.… But they will not March boldly up to a work—orstand exposed on a Plain.” The paradigm was Bunker Hill. Occupy a strongdefensive position, then invite the British to attack, and the men would fightlike demons. That was the picture and tactical vision that Washington wascarrying in his mind on the road to New York.9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts9]THEIR COMPENSATING ASSET, intangible but essential, was that they were allvolunteers fighting for a cause they believed in passionately. On severaloccasions outside Boston, Washington had brandished this asset before them.“Whilst we have men who in every way are superior to mercenary troops,” heurged, “why cannot we in appearance also be superior to them, when we fight forLife, Liberty, Property and our Country?” But the question made no sense to thebulk of the troops, who regarded instinctive obedience to orders and readyacceptance of subordination within a military hierarchy as infringements on thevery liberty they were fighting for. They saw themselves as invincible, notbecause they were disciplined soldiers like the redcoats but because they werepatriotic, liberty-loving men willing to risk their lives for theirconvictions.10 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts10]In that sense they embodied what came to be called “the spirit of ’76,” alsoknown at the time as “rage militaire.” This was the heartfelt but romanticnotion that the moral supremacy of the American quest for independence was anindefatigable and undefeatable force—picture Joseph Warren going down in gloryat Bunker Hill. Neither Washington, who was too much of a realist to embracethis attitude, nor the troops themselves knew it at the time—there was no waythey could—but the so-called spirit of ’76 was dying even before the year itselfended and, most ironically, even before the Continental Congress got around tomaking American independence official. What one historian has called “the NormanRockwell moments of the war” were over. The military struggle was not going tobe a short conflict won by a burst of American patriotism that convinced theBritish that the game was not worth the candle. It was going to be a protractedwar in which the capacity to endure would count more than the purity of “TheCause.” For that kind of conflict, and Washington knew this, the ContinentalArmy as currently constituted was woefully inadequate, indeed no match for theirdisciplined British opponents.11 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts11]For once you got past the patriotic rhetoric and the romantic glorification ofamateur status, the simple fact was that the so-called Continental Army was lessthan a year old. For over a century, the British Army had been building up aninstitution with rules and procedures that were now established. The ContinentalArmy had to start from scratch, improvising on the run to create a centralizedcommissary system for providing food, a quartermaster corps to deliver equipmentand clothing, and rules for hygiene and medical care, right down to theelemental matters of latrines and waste disposal.Nor was that all. Questions of pay rates for officers, procedures forcourts-martial, and uniform regulations for marching and drill all had to beinvented and then standardized. And because enlistments for the vast majority ofthe troops lasted only a year, the Continental Army would become a permanentturnstile, different soldiers always coming and going, so that by the time theyhad learned the rudiments of military life, they were replaced by inexperiencedrecruits. Washington kept pressing his civilian superiors in the congress formandatory troop allotments from each state and inducements for those willing toserve for three years or, better yet, “for the duration.” But the response fromthe congress was stunned silence, since what Washington was requesting soundedvery much like a permanent standing army, the epitome of everything Americanswere rebelling against.Moreover, allegiances were still provincial rather than national, meaningcircumscribed by local and at most state loyalties, so all the politicalincentives favored service in the state militia, and in most states the payrates were higher as well, making the Continental Army the choice of lastresort.Creating an officer’s corps de novo, especially at the senior level, alsopresented a unique set of problems. In the British Army, senior officers werethe product of privilege and merit. The privilege came from being born into thearistocracy, the merit from undergoing about twenty years of experience as aproven leader on the battlefield. Since America had no such thing as a titledaristocracy and the only military theater in which soldiers could have acquiredexperience was the French and Indian War, the pool of candidates was quitesmall, though large enough to include Washington and a few others like CharlesLee, the most experienced and colorful general in the Continental Army. Lee’smany eccentricities included an ever-present pack of dogs that accompanied himinto battle and the nickname “Boiling Water,” given him by the Mohawk tribe forhis unpredictable volatility.12 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts12]But Washington and Lee, in different ways that would eventually collide, weresingular figures. More typical, and more illustrative of the leadership problemfacing the fledging Continental Army, were two men who, over the long course ofthe war, turned out to be examples of Washington’s excellent eye for talent.One was Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island Quaker who was cast out of the Societyof Friends because of his support for the war. In 1775 Greene was a private in aRhode Island militia unit called the Kentish Guards. A year later he was abrigadier general, plucked from the ranks outside Boston on the basis of hisconspicuous intelligence and dedication.13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts13]The other was Henry Knox, one of the fattest men in the Continental Army at wellover three hundred pounds, whose only experience of war had been acquiredthrough books, which he devoured feverishly in his own Boston bookstore.Impressed with Knox’s resourcefulness in transporting the British cannonscaptured at Ticonderoga on forty sleds over the ice and snow, thenear-impossible logistical feat that had provided the firepower on DorchesterHeights so crucial in forcing the British withdrawal from Boston, Washingtonappointed Knox to head the artillery regiment in the Continental Army.14[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts14]The appointment of Greene and Knox as senior officers is usually cited as anexample of Washington’s uncanny judgment about latent ability. And this isunquestionably correct, as their performance over the next seven years wouldconfirm. But in the moment, which is to say in the spring of 1776, Greene andKnox represented the unprecedented level of military inexperience leading theContinental Army. In any European context, or from the perspective of theofficer class of the British Army, they were preposterously unimaginable. To besure, America was already renowned as the land of opportunity, where credentialsmattered less than demonstrated ability. But Greene and Knox, neither of whomhad ever before heard a shot fired in anger, were measures of Washington’sdesperation and the novice status of the Continental Army. No one wanted to sayit outright, but the looming battle in New York represented their opportunity toacquire on-the-job training.Finally, there was the problematic character of New York itself as the site fora stand. Unquestionably, New York enjoyed enormous strategic significance. AsAdams had already apprised Washington, it was “the nexus of the Northern andSouthern colonies … the key to the whole Continent, as it is a Passage toCanada, to the Great Lakes, and to all the Indian Nations.” Sent south toreconnoiter the terrain because of his experienced eye, Charles Lee confirmedAdams’s assessment, agreeing that “the consequences of the Enemy’s possessingthemselves of New York have appeard’d to us so terrible that I have scarce beenable to speak.” But Lee then went on to conclude that New York was indefensible.“What to do with this city, I own puzzles me,” Lee wrote, “it is so encircledwith deep navigable water, that whoever commands the sea commands the town.”15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts15]There was no question as to who commanded the sea. The Royal Navy ruled thewaves like no other navy in modern history. And one look at a map confirmed thatthe city of New York consisted of three islands—Staten Island, Long Island, andManhattan—and that the shorelines of all were accessible to amphibious landingsin multiple locations via Long Island Sound and the Hudson and East rivers.There was no such thing as a Continental navy, only a small flotilla ofprivateers capable of harassing smaller British vessels off the New Englandcoast. Total naval supremacy gave the British Army floating platforms ofartillery at any point of attack and the tactical agility to move troopswherever and whenever they wished. This was not to mention that New Yorkcontained the highest percentage of loyalists of any colony in North America.16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts16]And so, as the spring flowers bloomed and the grasses greened along the road toNew York, the honeymoon phase of the American Revolution was coming to an end.The victorious insurgency was about to become a full-scale war. The multipletoasts to Washington in the towns and villages through which he and the armypassed echoed the patriotic chords of a hymn to “The Cause,” which wassimultaneously glorious and invincible. A more detached assessment would haveproduced a more ominous tune, with lyrics about a quasi-army of marginalmisfits, led by a team of overconfident amateurs, marching to defend astrategically significant city that, truth be known, was indefensible.AS THE MAKESHIFT AMERICAN ARMY trudged south and the Continental Congress waitedfor popular opinion on independence to congeal, the British war machine wasgearing up at lightning speed. In a nearly miraculous burst of logisticalenergy, Great Britain assembled a fleet of 427 ships equipped with 1,200 cannonsto transport 32,000 soldiers and 10,000 sailors across the Atlantic. It was thelargest amphibious operation ever attempted by any European power, with anattack force larger than the population of Philadelphia, the biggest city inAmerica. Having concluded that nothing less was at stake than retention of allits American colonies, the top echelon of the government at Whitehall haddecided to show the imperious face of the British Empire.17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts17]The man most responsible for this logistical legerdemain was Lord GeorgeGermain, whose appointment as secretary of state for the American coloniessignaled the commitment of the British ministry to an aggressive policy designedto smash the American rebellion with one massive blow. Germain had made his ownconvictions clear soon after the stunning report of the bloodletting at BunkerHill reached London. “As there is no common sense in protracting a war of thissort,” Lord George wrote, apparently unaware of his echo of Thomas Paine’spamphlet, “I should be for exerting the utmost force of this Kingdom to finishthe rebellion in one campaign.” The enormous armada assembling at severalEnglish ports—nearly half the British fleet—plus the 18,000 mercenarieseventually recruited from several German principalities at considerable cost,all represented Germain’s commitment to the projection of Britain’s fullmilitary might in order to ensure a decisive outcome.18[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts18]All historical assessments of Germain are clouded by the vilification thatbefell him in the wake of the eventual American victory, when he was describedas “probably the most incompetent official that ever held an important post at acritical moment.” This retrospective description made perfect sense, since theloss of its entire North American empire was beyond much doubt the biggestblunder in the history of British statecraft, and Germain more than anyone elseshaped the ill-fated British policy. And once this interpretive angle wasestablished, Germain’s belligerent tendencies fell into line as the inevitableexcesses of a man whose military reputation had been tarnished by accusations ofcowardice and incompetence at the Battle of Minden (1759), which he then spentthe rest of his career trying to redeem with conspicuously aggressivepolicies.19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts19]But in this case, hindsight tends to obscure rather than clarify ourunderstanding of a highly dramatic and consequential historical moment. ForGermain grasped instinctively the seriousness and depth of the threatrepresented by the American rebellion. He dismissed as blatant idiocy thecondescending confidence of several retired British generals, one of whomclaimed that he could march across the American colonies with 5,000 men andsubdue the rebellion in a month. Germain knew that he was up against aformidable force that defied conventional measures of military effectiveness,and he worried that in a protracted war, space and time would be on the side ofthe rebels. The vast size of the American theater, plus the latent energies of aproud people, numerous and armed, would gradually wear down the British resolveunless the rebellion was quashed before these larger forces could be brought tobear.Moreover, Germain had a military strategy that reflected his keen sense ofpolitical urgency. For all the reasons John Adams had listed, New York was thepreferred target. But then, once subdued and occupied as the base of operationsfor the British army and navy, Germain envisioned mounting a campaign up theHudson corridor that would meet a British army coming down from Canada, therebysealing New England off from the middle and southern colonies. Once joined,these two British armies would march through western New England toward Boston,destroying the cradle of the American rebellion as they went, while the Britishnavy wreaked havoc on all the coastal cities and towns.Even in retrospect, it was an extremely sophisticated strategy that might wellhave worked if it had been implemented early in the war. It showed that Germainrecognized from the start the great danger hovering over any military campaignagainst the Americans: namely, that the British Army—no matter how large andexperienced—would dissipate its strength marching hither and yon across the vastAmerican landscape in search of a strategic center of the rebellion that in factdid not exist. (This is eventually what happened.) Germain’s plan avoided thatill-fated prospect by insisting on a concentrated display of British militarysupremacy against a focused objective, an isolated New England, which heidentified as the wellspring and soul of the American insurgency.20[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts20]Finally, Germain handpicked the Howe brothers to lead the British naval andground forces. Admiral Lord Richard Howe, nicknamed “Black Dick” for hiscongenital gravity, was at forty-nine near the peak of his powers as the ablestseaman in the greatest navy in the world. Like William, his younger brother,Lord Richard was connected by blood to the royal family, albeit in an awkwardfashion: their grandmother had been the favorite mistress of George I. Both hadattended Eton, the preferred gateway for the most privileged members of theBritish aristocracy, and both occupied secure seats in Parliament, where as goodWhigs they had originally favored a diplomatic resolution of the Anglo-Americanconflict, at least in part because of their mutual affection for the citizenryof Massachusetts, who had raised 250 pounds for a monument in honor of theirolder brother, George Augustus Howe, killed at Ticonderoga in 1758. By 1776,however, both men had concluded that the ongoing war could be ended only bydelivering a decisive blow that would bring their American cousins to theirsenses. Both relished the opportunity to deliver such a blow but relished evenmore the opportunity to then negotiate a peace that would end this misguided andunfortunate conflict promptly.21 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts21]General William Howe, the younger but taller brother at forty-five and nearlysix feet, had the more glamorous military record. And because his decisionsduring the battle for New York proved so consequential, his career merits a moreextended pause.Much in the manner of Washington, the foundation of Howe’s military educationwas laid during the French and Indian War. And again like Washington, he hadsurvived several actions without a scratch when all around him went down inheaps of blood and gore. As a young officer, Howe had led the “forlorn hope”assault (i.e., suicide mission) on the Plains of Abraham at Quebec, which provedto be the decisive action in the culminating battle of the war. In the middleyears of his career, he developed a reputation for mastery of light infantrytactics that put a premium on speed of maneuver. After his conspicuous displayof tactical agility at the Battle of Havana, he was generally regarded as themost brilliant regimental commander in the British Army.Howe’s role at Bunker Hill reinforced his reputation for personal courage butalso added a new dimension of fatalism to his military mentality. He had led thefirst wave, accompanied by his staff and a servant carrying a silver tray with adecanter of wine. Obviously unimpressed with the fighting prowess of themilitia, Howe had presumed the assault would be a waltz. But his entire staff,including the servant, was wiped out that day, along with nearly half theattacking force, more than 1,000 men. Howe never fully recovered from the traumaof the experience and internalized both a newfound respect for the fightingspirit of American troops and a nearly obsessive aversion to frontal assaultsagainst entrenched positions.Something snapped in Howe after Bunker Hill. In one sense, his aristocraticstyle became even more flamboyant. While holed up in Boston, he spent more timeat the card tables and consumed almost obscene amounts of food and drink. Hethrew caution to the wind and developed an openly scandalous relationship withElizabeth Loring, the blond and beautiful twenty-four-year-old wife of a Bostonloyalist, who acquiesced to the liaison, correctly presuming that Howe wouldreward him for his broad-mindedness. The Lorings accompanied Howe in the retreatto Halifax, where Mrs. Loring resumed her role as Cleopatra to Howe’s MarcAntony. While gaming by day and enjoying the company of Mrs. Loring at night,Howe received word of his appointment as commander of His Majesty’s groundforces in North America, as well as Germain’s orders to prepare for a campaignagainst New York.22 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts22]Howe’s response to Germain conveyed a combination of weariness and warinessabout his new mission. “The scene here at present wears a lowering aspect,” heconfided to Germain, “there not being the least prospect of conciliating thecontinent unless its armies are roughly dealt with, and I confess myapprehension that such an event will readily be brought about.” In effect, Howeconcurred with Germain’s strategic analysis that a decisive blow had to bedelivered, and that any effort at reconciliation could only come after amilitary campaign of overwhelming force had shocked the rebels into recognizingthe futility of their cause.While Howe harbored no doubts that a British army of the size Germain proposedcould deliver such a blow, he worried that the Americans would refuse tocooperate by attempting to defend New York. “Knowing their advantages in havingthe whole country, as it were, at their disposal,” Howe predicted, “they willnot readily be brought into a situation where the King’s troops can meet withthem on equal terms.” The rebel army was likely to withdraw inland, away fromthe coast, where the British navy gave its army such a tactical and logisticaladvantage. “Their armies retiring a few miles back from the navigable rivers,”Howe concluded, “ours cannot follow them from the difficulties I expect to meetwith in procuring land carriage.” Howe was already anticipating the kind ofproblems generals John Burgoyne and Charles Cornwallis would encounter oncemarooned inland without the protection of the British fleet. But his major pointwas that he seriously doubted the Americans would be so foolish as to fight aconventional battle against a numerically and professionally superior Britishforce. And the last place they would choose to do so was New York, which hefully expected they would abandon and probably burn to the ground.23[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts23]THE CONTINENTAL ARMY, in fact, did not have a comprehensive strategy for theconduct of the war. During the Boston Siege, several of Washington’s seniorofficers, chiefly Charles Lee and Horatio Gates—both not so incidentallyveterans of the British Army—had argued for a defensive strategy along just thelines that Howe had anticipated. Gates had even suggested taking the army westof the Alleghenies and daring the British Army to pursue them, while Lee seemedto favor a “war of posts” in which the Continental Army avoided any full-scaleengagements except on the most favorable terms. On occasion Lee suggesteddividing the army into several smaller units, then conducting quasi-guerrillaoperations designed to harass and frustrate the British Army.24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts24]But these were merely conversations during councils of war outside Boston.Devising a comprehensive strategy for the conduct of the war required anestablished government with clearly delineated powers and designated decisionmakers charged with coordinating the quite monumental civil and militaryconsiderations. Both the Continental Congress and the Continental Army werestill provisional improvisations, managing the imperial crisis as best theycould, one step at a time. Indeed, at the moment, the question of militarystrategy had to be deferred until the all-important question of independence wasresolved. A decisive presence like Lord Germain was unimaginable in an Americancontext, because no political infrastructure or lines of authority had yet beendevised, and until independence was decided, it was unclear that any would beneeded.And so, when Washington arrived in New York on April 13, the question of whetherNew York should be defended had never even been raised. “The designs of theEnemy are too much behind the Curtain for me to form any accurate opinion oftheir Plan of operations,” Washington confided to Hancock, adding that “we areleft to wander in the field of conjecture.” All such wanderings, however, led tothe conclusion that “no place—all of its consequences considered—seemed of moreImportance in execution of their Grand Plan than possessing themselves ofHudson’s River.”25 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts25]Since no American version of a “Grand Plan” was in place to guide a decision,Washington was implicitly acknowledging that British strategy would dictateAmerican strategy. In practice, this meant that wherever Howe (or Germain) choseto attack, Washington felt obliged to defend. Everyone on both sides seemed toagree that New York was the obvious target, which was why Washington was settingup his new headquarters in Manhattan by mid-April. The fact that Lee’s earlierreconnaissance of the terrain had concluded that New York was inherentlyindefensible had at least temporarily dropped out of the strategic equation.It dropped back in over the ensuing month as Washington’s own eyes surveyed thesame terrain, now dotted with multiple forts, redoubts, trenches, andbarricades, all being constructed by a small army of day laborers, soldiers, andslaves according to an engineering scheme Lee had devised to transform avulnerable archipelago into something resembling an armed camp. Lee’s primarypurpose had been to restrict British naval mobility at the entrances to theHudson and East rivers and then to construct a series of defensive positions onManhattan Island that would permit American troops to inflict heavy casualtieson the British, then fall back to the next line. It was not so much a recipe forAmerican victory as an attempt to create a series of Bunker Hills in which theprobable British victory would come at a very high cost.26[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts26]As this grim scenario began to settle in his mind, Washington decided that thebest way to bolster his waning confidence was to redouble the forts andentrenchments on Manhattan and Long Island. He enlisted one of his brigadierswho had been born and raised in New York, General William Alexander, to overseetwo full regiments, who proceeded to dig and build ten hours a day. (Alexanderclaimed descent from Scottish royalty, and though the House of Lords rejectedhis claim, he insisted on being called Lord Stirling, and everyone, includingWashington, somewhat strangely complied.) As Long Island loomed larger inWashington’s mind as a likely invasion route, he assigned the construction ofits defenses to Nathanael Greene, who, true to form, began to turn BrooklynHeights into a honeycomb of connected forts, redoubts, and trenches, a kind ofBunker Hill on steroids.27 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts27]But as the weather warmed, it became quite clear that New York resisted allcomparisons with Boston. “The Fortifications in and about this City areexceedingly strong, and strengthening everyday,” Greene wrote his brother. “Butthe New England Colonies without the least fortification [are] easier defendedthan this Colony … owing to the different dispositions of the People. Torieshere are as plenty as Whigs with you.”28[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts28]Indeed, reports had it that most of the farmers on Long Island were loyalists,or at least British sympathizers, and that they were organizing a militia unitto join the British Army once it arrived in force. The governor of the colony,the mayor of New York City, and the majority of the wealthiest residents wereall loyal to the crown and thereby lent considerable credibility to the Britishclaim that any invasion and occupation of New York was less a hostile act than amuch-welcomed liberation. And so, while the water-laced geography of New Yorkmade it strategically indefensible, probably the worst spot on the AtlanticCoast for the Americans to make a stand, the political architecture of the cityand surrounding countryside made it the most hostile environment in all theAmerican colonies to defend, because so many of the residents did not wish to bedefended.As these depressing realizations continued to mount, Washington tried to takesolace from all those new forts and artillery emplacements—defense mechanismsagainst his own growing skepticism as much as against the looming Britishleviathan. He also issued orders on an almost daily basis designed to projectthe impression that the Continental Army was a welcomed guest in the city andmust conduct itself according to the highest standards of civility and manners.“The General flatters himself,” read one typical General Order, “that he shallhear no Complaints from the Citizens, of abuse, or ill treatment, in any respectwhatsoever; but that every Officer, and Soldier, of every Rank and Denominationwill pride themselves (as Men contending in the glorious Cause of Liberty oughtto do) in an orderly, decent, and regular deportment.”29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts29]The less patriotic and more prosaic reality was that relations between thetroops and the residents were tense, often violent and abusive, much in themanner of an unwelcome occupying army. The toxic social chemistry was renderedmore poisonous by the presence of the largest brothel in North America, in aneighborhood sardonically named the Holy Ground, populated by a veritable armyof prostitutes eager to share their charms and venereal diseases with virileyoung men lacking families or futures. Most of the prostitutes were tough-mindedloyalists, and when two soldiers were murdered and castrated, then stuffed in abarrel, their regiment retaliated the next day by pulling down two houses of illrepute where the suspected killers plied their trade. Washington condemned theregiment’s behavior as a conspicuous violation of regulations, ignoring the realsource of the problem.30 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts30]Finally, to make matters worse, the Continental Congress ordered Washington torelease six of his regiments to bolster an ill-conceived campaign to captureQuebec, part of a bold initiative that Washington had earlier endorsed to denyGreat Britain a safe base from which to spread mischief among the Six Nations,the Native American confederation already leaning toward an alliance with theredcoats. Washington somewhat reluctantly agreed, apprising Hancock thatalthough New York had become “the Grand Magazine of America,” at this rate therewould be no one left to oppose the imminent British invasion.31[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts31]Assurances from the congress took the form of guarantees that militia units fromNew York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New Jersey were already placed onalert and poised to move as soon as the British fleet was sighted on thehorizon, adding about 15,000 troops to Washington’s New York garrison. From apatriotic perspective, this was splendid news, confirmation that America’sminutemen were ready to live up to their name. From a more professionalperspective, however, this arrangement had an almost comical character, sincenone of the militia units had been given designated areas of responsibility oneither Manhattan or Long Island, had not been integrated into the regimen of theContinental Army, and were presumably expected to make a difference just byshowing up.By late May, Washington had seen enough to recognize the strategic and politicalprecariousness of his position and had begun to adopt a fatalistic posturetoward the looming calamity. “We expect a very bloody Summer of it at New York,”he wrote his brother, “as it is here I expect the grand efforts of the Enemywill be aim’d; and I am sorry to say that we are not either in Men, or Arms,prepared for it.” But for several unspoken reasons—all that work on all thoseforts, the sense that he had bested Howe before and could do it again, and thenear unanimity of his civilian superiors in the congress that New York must notbe abandoned—he never gave serious consideration to doing what Howe presumed hewould do and abandon New York for more defensible terrain inland. Since all thetangible signs were bad, he took final refuge in the intangible potency of “TheCause” itself: “If our cause is just, as I do most religiously believe it to be,the same Providence which has in so many Instances appeared for us, will stillgo on to afford its aid.” He was counting on a miracle.32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts32]THE LAST OPPORTUNITY to rethink the New York commitment occurred in late May andearly June, when Washington was called to Philadelphia to confer with thedelegates of the Continental Congress about overall American strategy. It wasthe first such session ever, but for several reasons the gravity of the militarysituation in New York never received the concerted attention it deserved.Washington brought along his wife, Martha, so that she might undergoinoculation, and given the risky character of the procedure, a part ofWashington’s mind was preoccupied with her recovery. News of the completedebacle suffered by American troops at Quebec also arrived during this time,casting a pall over the deliberations because it was the first unmitigatedAmerican defeat in the war and was wholly unexpected, but it was explained awayon the grounds—not wholly unfounded—that the American troops were riddled withsmallpox. A delegation of Native American chiefs being cultivated as prospectiveallies added to the confusion by insisting that they would remain in attendanceonly if assured that they would be provided with sufficient amounts of alcoholduring the negotiations.33 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts33]But the big distraction came in the form of a resolution passed on May 15 by theVirginia legislature that arrived in Philadelphia just before Washington and hisentourage. For obvious reasons, it immediately dominated the agenda of theContinental Congress because it proposed “that these United Colonies are, and ofright ought to be, free and independent States.” In effect, the summit onmilitary strategy was coinciding with the climactic political moment when thelong-delayed discussion on American independence finally came before thecongress. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia moved the resolution on June 7, and thecongress immediately appointed a five-member committee to draft a documentimplementing Lee’s resolution. The crucial military and political decisions werecresting simultaneously.34 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts34]Washington kept an elaborate account of all his expenses for the trip to andresidence in Philadelphia but made no record of the all-important deliberationsabout the defense of New York. Part of his own attention was diverted by thelooming vote on independence, which he was not sure would carry because of thelingering reluctance of moderate delegates like John Dickinson to face theinevitable. “Members of Congress, in short, the representation of wholeProvinces,” he wrote his brother, “are still feeding themselves on the daintyfood of reconciliation.” The recent arrival of news from London that the Britishministry was sending peace commissioners to negotiate a political solution tothe conflict struck Washington as an obvious ploy designed to enhance the futilehopes of the moderate faction in the congress, a tactic he could only deplore asblatant manipulation.35 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts35]Though no record of the committee’s deliberations was kept, correspondence overthe ensuing weeks and subsequent reports of the congress made it clear that thecommittee made two decisions. First, it created a new Board of War and Ordnanceto coordinate all military strategy and to be chaired by John Adams, making himthe de facto secretary of war. Adams accepted the new post reluctantly, echoingWashington’s statement, almost exactly a year earlier, that he was unqualifiedfor the job. “It is a great Mortification to me I confess,” he confided toGreene, “and I fear it will too often be a Misfortune to our Country, that I amcalled to the Discharge of a Trust to which I feel myself so unequal, and in theExecution of which I can derive no assistance from my Education or former Courseof Life.” He began asking friends in Boston to scour the Harvard library forbooks on how to run an army. An array of amateur soldiers and officers was nowto be supervised by a civilian with no military experience whatsoever.36[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts36]Second, the question of New York’s defense received extended attention, but thefocus was on the additional resources Washington believed he needed to stop thelooming invasion, not on whether New York should be defended at all. The latter,of course, was the most crucial and consequential consideration, the mostelemental strategic issue of all, but it was never faced or even raised. Thoughit is always intellectually awkward to explain a nonevent, in this case theeffort seems justified, knowing as we do that the entire cascade of battlefieldhorrors about to befall Washington and his inexperienced troops followedinevitably from this basic strategic blunder.Context helps explain what is otherwise bafflingly inexplicable. It helps torecall the relentless outpouring of praise for Washington and his troops in thewake of the British evacuation of Boston. As noted earlier, though there wasnever a real battle, the British retreat was portrayed as a monumental victoryfor the Continental Army. Most if not all the delegates in the ContinentalCongress, Adams included, harbored an inflated opinion of the military prowessof Washington’s raw recruits, as well as an ill-informed and wholly unrealisticestimate of the militia as a dependable fighting force. Greene once tried,albeit gently and diplomatically, to disabuse Adams about all this. “You thinkthe present army assisted by the militia is sufficient to oppose the force ofGreat Britain,” he warned. “I can assure you it is necessary to make greatallowances in the calculation of our strength … or else you’ll be greatlydeceived.” Adams was, in fact, convinced that Washington would repeat in NewYork the same splendid outcome over Howe’s army that he had delivered inBoston.37 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts37]Washington himself knew better, but he found it impossible to tell his civiliansuperior that the florid praise they were passing out so freely was misplacedand that the confidence in both him and his army was equally excessive. Heappeared to take refuge in the quasi-spiritual power of “The Cause” and in thepossibility of multiple repetitions of the Bunker Hill carnage on Long Islandand Manhattan. “If our troops will behave well,” he confided to Hancock, Howe’stroops “will have to wade through much blood & Slaughter before they can carryany part of our Works, If they carry ’em at all.… May the sacredness of ourcause Inspire our Soldiery with sentiments of Heroism, and lead ’em to theperformance of noblest exploits.”38[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts38]It also made a difference that Howe’s army was likely to arrive at the samemoment that the question of American independence would be decided. How would itlook if just as the political climax to years of debate finally occurred, themilitary embodiment of that glorious cause fled New York for the security of theConnecticut hills and allowed Howe to occupy the city without a fight? Themounting political momentum for independence also buoyed confidence in themilitary commitment to defend New York. The Americans had profound politicalreasons to avoid appearing militarily weak and vulnerable at this propitiousmoment when, at last, independence was about to be declared.Of course, someone could have asked how it would look if precisely when thecelebrations of American independence were ringing in the air, news arrived fromNew York that the Continental Army had just been annihilated. Even to pose sucha question seemed almost unpatriotic in this overheated moment, and no one did.While in Philadelphia, Washington was promised a major injection of new militiafrom New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, raising his troop strength to slightlyover 25,000, more than half of whom were militia. He was authorized to round upand arrest the known loyalists on Long Island, thus ending the pretense thatthey could not be touched until a formal declaration of independence had beenmade. He was directed to construct “as many fire rafts, row gallies, armedboats, and floating batteries as may be necessary,” a final gesture at impedingBritish naval access up the Hudson and East rivers.39[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts39]On the day Washington arrived back in New York, his aides apprised him that manyof the incoming militia lacked muskets. The next day, headquarters issued anorder that these men be equipped with spears. This was an ominous sign.40[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts40]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 3[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]DOGS THAT DID NOT BARK--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We are in the very midst of a Revolution, the most compleat, unexpected, andremarkable of any in the History of Nations.—JOHN ADAMS TO WILLIAM CUSHING, June 9, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The British invasion was choreographed by Lord Germain and his minions atWhitehall much like a transatlantic race. First off in early June were GeneralWilliam Howe and his 9,000 veterans of the Boston Siege, sailing out of Halifax,Betsy Loring’s blond hair blowing in the wind alongside the dapper if paunchyHowe, whose only worry was that Washington would refuse to make a stand in NewYork. Coming up from the South Carolina coast was a smaller fleet with 2,900troops under the command of General Henry Clinton, who had just failed tocapture Charlestown and was eager to avenge that setback in New York, where hehad been born and raised as the son of the royal governor.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts1]Last off the mark was Admiral Richard Howe with by far the largest fleet, morethan 150 ships with 20,000 troops and a six-month supply of food and munitions,by itself the largest armada to cross the Atlantic before the AmericanExpeditionary Force in World War I. Lacking any semblance of moderncommunications technology, Germain had somehow managed to defy the insuperableobstacles of space and distance to coordinate this three-pronged assault so thatit converged on Staten Island, if not simultaneously, at least within a matterof weeks. No transatlantic military operation of this scale and scope had everbeen tried before, and the deftness with which it was carried off was eloquenttestimony to the matchless prowess of the Royal Navy.AS BRITISH MILITARY POWER WAS converging, American political power was spreadingout. The resolution passed by the Continental Congress on May 15 was a clarioncall to force an up-or-down vote in the colonial legislatures on the question ofindependence. Several colonies insisted that the question be forwarded to localgovernments at the county or town level, thereby extending the debate beyond thecolonial capitals to the countryside. Massachusetts, for example, requested andreceived fifty-eight responses from towns and counties in late May and June, allanswering the question whether “said Inhabitants … solemnly engage with theirLives and Fortunes to Support the [Continental] Congress in the Measure.”2[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts2]In British history there had been several occasions when Parliament had issuedpetitions or declarations designed to limit or terminate monarchical power, mostfamously during the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. So the legalprecedent for disposing of kings who had allegedly violated the covenant withtheir subjects was well established. Indeed, if you were a king and were shown adocument that began with the word “Whereas,” you should expect a list ofgrievances to follow and realize that your reign was likely to be of shortduration. But there was no precedent for the extensive and far-reaching mandatethat the Continental Congress was now requesting, which had the appearance of afull-scale popular referendum, something resembling the approach of an unbridleddemocracy.3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts3]The British ministry and the Continental Congress were, in fact, looking at thecrisis from different ends of the same telescope in ways that accuratelyreflected their contrasting political assumptions. The British approach wasdecisively imperial, top down from George III, through Lord Germain, to allthose converging ships and men. The American approach was decidedly republican,bottom up, dependent upon broad-based popular consent from that enigmatic entitycalled “the people.” To repeat, nothing so sweepingly democratic had ever beenattempted before, for the quite sound reason that a poll of the people wasalmost assured to produce a muffled or divided response or, worse, a chaoticcacophony.What seems most historically significant, at least in retrospect, is how trueeach side was to the core values it claimed to be fighting for. It was thecoercive power of an empire against the consensual potency of a fledgingrepublic. History seldom provides pure embodiments of such contrasting politicalalternatives, but in the summer of 1776 they were both on display, and themilitary projections of both perspectives were committed to a collision at themouth of the Hudson.IF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS WAS asking for a referendum on Americanindependence, and it was, the answer came back in the form of a landslide.Massachusetts lived up to its reputation as the cradle of the rebellion bydelivering a nearly unanimous verdict. The town of Ashby put it most succinctly:“That should the honorable Congress, for the safety of the Colonies, declarethem independent of Great Britain, the inhabitants of Ashby will solemnly engagewith their lives and fortunes to support them in the measure.”4[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts4]Massachusetts had experienced the brunt of British military harassment over thepast year and had also enjoyed the most long-standing tradition of robustparticipation at the town level, so it was not surprising that the turnout inthe Bay Colony proved so huge and the verdict so resounding. Nevertheless, thereis something almost elegiac about the picture of ordinary farmers, mostaccustomed to meeting for discussions about local property lines or regulationsagainst roaming cows or pigs, gathering in the meetinghouse to debate the fateof America’s role in the British Empire.5[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts5]The residents of Topsfield, for example, observed that it was “the greatest andmost important question that ever came before this town.” They went on toexplain that only a few years earlier “such a question would have put us intosurprise, and we apprehend, would have been treated with the utmost contempt.”But now the political landscape had changed dramatically: “She who was withoutany just cause, or injury done by these Colonies, has become their greatestEnemy. The unprovoked injuries these Colonies have received; the unjustifiableclaims that have been made on the Colonies by the Court of Great Britain, toforce us, and take away our substance from us, without our consent … have beencruel and unjust to the highest degree.”6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts6]Topsfield, in fact, was in tune with multiple resolutions throughout thecolonies in describing their embrace of independence as a recent and reluctantdevelopment forced upon them by the policies of George III and his ministersover the past year. “The time was, sir,” said the good people of Malden,Massachusetts, “when we loved the King and the people of Great Britain with anaffection truly filial … but our sentiments are now altered forever.” Boston,predictably, weighed in with the most defiant response, describing any thoughtof reconciliation “to be as dangerous as it is absurd,” and “loyalty to theworst of tyrants as treason to our country.” Elaborate constitutional argumentswere laid aside in favor of more elemental pronouncements of lost affection fora father figure who was sending the flower of the British army and navy, alongwith a hired team of Germanic mercenaries, to murder them in cold blood.7[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts7]This response validated the Adams strategy of delay while the fruits ofindependence ripened on the imperial vine. It was the accumulation of evidenceabout the belligerent intentions of George III and the British ministry thatwore down old allegiances and made the decisive difference among ordinaryAmericans. The recruitment of foreign mercenaries was frequently mentioned asthe ultimate stab in the back. Reading the resolutions that poured into thecolonial legislatures and then the Continental Congress was like harvesting apolitical crop that had been planted and nourished by the king himself. A yearearlier, independence had seemed some combination of impossible and improbable.Now it seemed inevitable.The returns from Virginia were just as resolute as those from New England,though the voices beyond Williamsburg came from counties rather than townsbecause of the different demographics. The Virginia Convention, in fact, was thefirst off the mark, delivering its decisive commitment to independence evenbefore receiving the request to do so by the Continental Congress. Again, likemost of their fellow colonists, the Virginians cataloged the list of oppressivepolicies imposed by George III and his ministers in recent months, culminatingin the dispatch of “Fleets and Armies … and the aid of foreign troops engaged toassist these destructive purposes.”Virginia cited one grievance unique to its situation, which somewhat awkwardlyraised the forbidden subject of slavery: “The King’s representative in thiscolony [Lord Dunmore] hath not only withheld all the powers of Government foroperating for our safety, but having returned on board an armed ship, iscarrying on a piratical and savage war against us, tempting our slaves by everyartifice to resort to him, and training and employing them against theirmasters.” Dunmore had in fact issued a blanket offer of emancipation to allVirginia slaves who joined him, simultaneously igniting a primal fear of slaveinsurrection harbored by the planter class, while also exposing the moralcontradiction south of the Potomac of slave owners wrapping themselves in therhetoric of liberty.8 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts8]The resolutions from the Virginia Convention and the instructions from fourVirginia counties were all pro-independence and anti-reconciliation, like thoseof their compatriots in New England, but they were also more philosophical andexpansive, like written speeches rather than legal briefs. Their tone made itclear that Virginia regarded itself as the most important player in thispolitical crisis, and the Virginians sent their resolutions to all the othercolonies on the assumption that they set the standard for others to imitate.Given the primacy of Massachusetts in the struggle to date, this was a ratherpresumptive posture, but it came to the Virginians naturally.9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts9]Thus far the referendum on independence had been remarkably harmonious, but thefirst dissonant sounds were sure to come from the middle colonies, mostespecially Pennsylvania and New York. Both colonies contained a significantnumber of loyalists and an even larger number of reluctant revolutionaries stillgrasping at the possibility of a last-minute political reconciliation. Thelegislatures in both colonies had instructed their delegates to the ContinentalCongress, as Pennsylvania put it, “to dissent from any notion leading toseparation from the Mother Country.” And John Dickinson had used theseinstructions to block all of Adams’s efforts in the congress to create a unitedfront for independence throughout the spring of 1776. What was not clear assummer—and the massive British fleet—approached was whether political opinion inPennsylvania and New York had changed in response to the escalating militarycrisis.The initial reactions of the Pennsylvania and New York legislatures suggestedthat it had not. In Pennsylvania, the Quaker elite remained resolutely committedto a political solution at all costs. And in New York, many of the wealthiestmerchants remained outspokenly loyal to the crown. Despite the looming menace ofthe British invasion, both legislatures refused to alter instructions to theirdelegates to the Continental Congress.10[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts10]What then happened in both colonies exposed the latent political power of thebottom-up approach. In Pennsylvania, the radical mechanics of Philadelphia,Thomas Paine’s most ardent constituency, soon supported by petitions from foursurrounding counties, challenged the authority of the current legislature tospeak for the people. In effect, they argued that the elected representativeshad forfeited their right to govern by ignoring the seismic shift in popularopinion on the independence question over recent months. And, in a dazzlingdisplay of political agility, these mechanics, artisans, and ordinary farmersmobilized enough supporters to create a provisional government dominated bypro-independence representatives. (Their key reform was to expand the electorateby limiting the property qualification to vote, thereby ensuring a comfortablemajority in the constitutional convention and the new legislature.) One of theirfirst acts was to register their “willingness to concur in a vote of the[Continental] Congress declaring the United Colonies free and independentStates.”11 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts11]Something similar, though not quite as dramatically decisive, happened in NewYork. In New York City as in Philadelphia, organized associations of mechanics,again with the support of petitioners from surrounding counties, mounted acampaign to challenge the legitimacy of the elected government. In New York,however, opponents of independence were sufficiently powerful to block thecalling of a constitutional convention on the grounds that the petitionersthemselves were an extralegal body “without any authority whatsoever in thepublic transactions of the present times.” Though it was clear by mid-June thatthe provincial legislature was fighting a losing battle against a surgingpopular movement outside New York City, it resisted the inevitable until July 9,endorsing independence a full week after the Continental Congress made thedramatic move and even then lamenting “the cruel necessity which had renderedthat measure unavoidable.” By then “cruel necessity” referred to the veritableforest of British masts bobbing up and down in Long Island Sound.12[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts12]And so, even in colonies where resistance to independence enjoyed considerablesupport, pro-independence forces captured the elected governments on the basisof superior organizational skills and greater political energy. If the spearsbeing handed out to militia units on Long Island were an ominous sign for themilitary prospects of the Continental Army, the speed with which the supportersof independence seized control of the political agenda in Pennsylvania and NewYork was an ominous sign for the prospects of Great Britain’s imperial agenda.As it turned out, all the new state governments in the former United Colonieseventually came under the control of dedicated patriots fully committed toAmerican independence. This was not an accurate reflection of popular opinion asa whole, which was more divided, with perhaps a significant minority south ofthe Hudson wishing the crisis would somehow end, the armies disappear, so theycould get on with their splendidly ordinary lives. But at the moment, politicalcontrol rested with the more actively involved local leaders and citizens. Andif their words are to be believed, their conversion and subsequent commitment to“The Cause” was a choice literally forced on them by the nonnegotiable policiesof George III and that approaching flotilla of redcoats and foreign mercenaries.JOHN ADAMS COULD NOT have imagined a better outcome. As the resolutions andpetitions rolled into the Continental Congress in late May and June, theyamounted to close to a unanimous consensus on independence. But as in theSherlock Holmes short story, the dog that did not bark pleased him almost asmuch. Which is to say that all responses from the states stayed on point,meaning they focused on the core question of independence and did not append acomplicating catalog of demands about ending slavery, granting women theirrights, or removing property qualifications to vote. The prevailing attitudeseemed to be that independence was the all-important immediate question and thatcollateral concerns about the shape of the American republic should be postponedfor another day. As the citizens of Topsfield so nicely put it: “As innovationsare always dangerous, we heartily wish that the ancient rules in the[Massachusetts] Charter might be strictly adhered to until the whole of thePeople of this Colony have liberty to express their sentiments in respect tothat affair as fully as they have in the case of independence.”13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts13]The only exception seemed to be the Philadelphia mechanics, who were busywriting a Pennsylvania constitution that called for the expansion of thefranchise to include artisans and mechanics like themselves. But instead ofclouding or complicating the independence question—the great Adams fear—addingpropertyless men to the rolls of the citizenry only enlarged the pool ofpatriots. Indeed, without them Pennsylvania might well have remained a hugeobstacle in the road to independence. Adams was so thrilled to get Pennsylvaniainto the fold that he temporarily abandoned his long-standing belief in theproperty qualification to vote: “The Province of Pennsylvania … will soon becomean important Branch of the Confederation,” he wrote a friend in New York. “Thelarge Body of the People will be possessed of more power and Importance, and aproud Junto of less. And yet Justice will I hope be done to all.”14[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts14]For nearly a year, Adams had imagined the arrival of this climactic moment, andin his mind’s eye he had pictured the proper sequence of events that wouldpermit its orderly management. First, state constitutions, then a confederationof the states, then an alliance with France; then, and only then, once all thesepieces were in place, independence would be declared. But now events were makinga mockery of this orderly sequence. Up and down the Atlantic coast, new stateconstitutions were being debated, delegates to the Continental Congress wereshuffling in and out of Philadelphia with new instructions from their stategovernments, and the British fleet was expected to arrive at New York at anymoment. As Adams explained to Patrick Henry, he now realized that his hopes ofmanaging a political explosion had always been a pipe dream. “It is now prettyclear,” he wrote on June 3, “that all these Measures will follow one another inrapid succession, and it may not perhaps be of much Importance which is donefirst.”15 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts15]It was also “pretty clear” that when history was happening at such breakneckspeed, any effort at management was an illusion. Adams did not like thatrealization—it defied all his conservative instincts—but he had no choice but toaccept it. And if he could not control events, he could at least record them forposterity—perhaps the ultimate form of control. “In all the Correspondenciesthat I have maintained,” he wrote to Abigail, “I have never kept a single Copy.…I have now purchased a Folio Book, in the first Page of which … I am writingthis Letter, and intend to write [i.e., copy] all my Letters to you from thistime forward.” He urged Abigail to do the same thing, “for I really think thatyour Letters are much better worth preserving than mine.”16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts16]He had a keen sense of being present at the creation. As he explained to an oldBoston colleague: “Objects of the most Stupendous Magnitude, Measures in whichthe Lives and Liberties of Millions, born and unborn are most essentiallyinterested and now before Us. We are in the very midst of a Revolution, the mostcompleat, unexpected, and remarkable of any in the History of Nations.”17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts17]In the crowded character of the moment, Adams could be excused for anoverexcited assessment. But, in fact, he was not exaggerating. No republic—orconfederation of republics—on this scale and magnitude had ever been attempted.Adams truly was living “in the very midst of a Revolution,” and in June 1776 healso felt as if he were standing in the center of a wind storm as the currentsof history swept past him.As Adams’s correspondence during those hectic weeks reveals, his mind was mostlyoccupied with his duties as chair of the Board of War and Ordnance. Theseinvolved several postmortems on what had gone wrong at the Battle of Quebec,questions about where to acquire sufficient supplies of sulfur and saltpeter forgunpowder, proposals for the creation of an infant American navy, and worriesabout the neglected defenses around Boston. Strangely, Adams paid almost noattention to the military buildup in New York, perhaps believing that theconference with Washington had settled all outstanding problems so that therewas nothing to do now but trust in Washington’s leadership and wait for Howe’sfleet to arrive. At least part of his mind was on Abigail and their fourchildren, who were living outside Boston amid a raging smallpox epidemic. On thepolitical front, his chief focus was on sketching the outline for a new Americanforeign policy, with an eye toward attracting France as an invaluable Europeanally.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts18]He made no mention of his appointment to a five-person committee charged withdrafting a document announcing American independence to the world. Such acommittee seemed like a sensible idea because of the calendar of the congress.The vote on the Virginia Resolution, officially proposed by Richard Henry Lee onJune 7, had been delayed until July 1, in deference to several delegations thatwere obliged to confer with their state legislatures before any binding vote onindependence could be cast. If and when the Virginia Resolution passed, adocument should be ready so that the congress could proceed without pause topublish the decision. Adams convened the committee to draft that document onJune 11. The other members were Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, RobertLivingston, and Roger Sherman. None of them regarded the assignment asparticularly important. Depending on where you stood, the chief business wasgoing on back in the state conventions, in the still-divided Pennsylvania andNew York delegations at Philadelphia, and on the shorelines of Long Island andManhattan.19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts19]The obvious choice to draft the document was Benjamin Franklin, who wasgenerally regarded as the most accomplished prose stylist in America. ButFranklin refused, first taking refuge in a painful case of gout, then claimingthat, on the basis of several bitter experiences, he had vowed never to writeanything that would then be edited by a committee. Adams also declined thehonor, explaining that his prominence as a leader of the radical faction in thecongress would subject the document to greater scrutiny. He was overwhelmed aswell by his more pressing duties as head of the Board of War and Ordnance.Jefferson was the next choice, in part because he was a Virginian and theresolution was coming from Virginia, in part because he was more innocuous thanAdams. It would turn out to be one of the most consequential accidents inAmerican history.20 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts20]JEFFERSON HAD RETURNED to his post at Philadelphia on May 14 after a five-monthabsence back at Monticello, his mansion-in-the-making just outsideCharlottesville. His wife of four years was having a difficult pregnancy, hismother had died suddenly in March, and Jefferson himself was suffering frommigraine headaches, the first occurrence of what proved to be a chroniccondition. As soon as he arrived, he wanted to leave, believing that the mainbusiness was occurring in Williamsburg, where the Virginia Convention wasdrafting a new state constitution. “It is a work of the most interesting natureand such as every individual would wish to have his voice in,” he explained to aVirginia friend. “In truth, it is the whole object of the present controversy.”When Jefferson talked about “my country,” he was referring to Virginia, and heharbored a Virginia-writ-large view of America in which the momentous events nowcresting in Philadelphia were a mere sideshow. Based on his correspondence ofMay and June, it appears the imminent battle at New York never even crossed hismind.21 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts21]Almost exactly a year earlier, he had made what might be called a provincialversion of the grand entrance, arriving in Philadelphia aboard an ornatecarriage called a phaeton, drawn by four horses and accompanied by three slaves.Within the carefully calibrated hierarchy of the planter class in Virginia, hedid not make the top tier, in part because of his age—he was only thirty-two—andin part because he was a notoriously poor public speaker. At slightly over sixfoot two, with reddish blond hair and an erect posture described as “straight asa gun barrell,” he possessed the physical attributes of a Virginia grandee, buthe had a weak and “reedy” voice that did not project in large spaces. He wasalso by disposition self-contained, some combination of aloof and shy,customarily standing silently in groups, with his arms folded tightly around hischest as if to ward off intruders.22[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts22]He had made his political reputation with his pen, chiefly with a pamphlettitled A Summary View of the Rights of British America (1774), in which he wasone of the first to argue that Parliament lacked the authority not just to taxthe American colonies but to legislate for them at all. (In hindsight, SummaryView also contained some sharp criticisms of George III, an early rehearsal forthe more expansive indictment in the Declaration of Independence.) Adams hadimmediately recognized the young Virginian as a kindred spirit within theradical faction of the Continental Congress, silent but staunch in committees,and a “penman” who could be called upon to draft reports. The leadership in thecongress selected him to draft an address to George III titled Declaration ofthe Causes and Necessity for Taking Up Arms (1775), an important assignment thatreflected Jefferson’s reputation as a literary craftsman who could make hisgreatest contribution behind the scenes.23[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts23]Jefferson’s selection to draft what would become the most famous and revereddocument in American history was, then, part of a prevailing pattern. He hadbecome the unofficial draftsman of the Continental Congress. But it is importantto recognize that the golden haze that eventually enveloped the Declaration hadnot yet formed. Its subsequent significance was lost on all the participants,including Jefferson himself. All assumed that more important business was goingon elsewhere, either in other committees meeting in Philadelphia or, inJefferson’s case, down in Williamsburg. What became the great creative momentwas perceived by all concerned as a minor administrative chore.Most probably, which is to say that historians are not sure, the full committeemet at Franklin’s lodgings on or shortly after June 11 to discuss the contentand shape of the document. After reaching agreement on its general framework,they handed the task of composition to Jefferson. Much later, when the historicsignificance of the Declaration had become clear, he claimed that he had “turnedto neither book nor pamphlet while writing,” nor had he “copied from anyparticular or previous writing.” While literally true, the remark was misleadingand fed the emerging mythology of a solitary Jefferson, communing with the godsin some quasi-religious séance.24 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts24]In fact, he had before him, or at least in his mind’s eye, his recent draft of anew constitution for Virginia, which contained a long list of grievances againstGeorge III. His draft of the Declaration represented an expansion of that list,following a well-established formula enshrined in English history whenever aking needed to be restrained or deposed. Upon reading the published version ofthe Declaration, Edmund Pendleton, who was chairing the Virginia Convention,apprised Jefferson that the bill of indictment against George III in the draftconstitution he had sent to Williamsburg had apparently “exhausted the Subjectof Complaint against Geo. 3d. and [I] was at a loss to discover what theCongress could do … without copying, but find that you have acquitted yourselvesvery well on that score.” Jefferson had, in truth, been practicing the longgrievances section of the Declaration ever since Summary View, had refined thedraft in his version of Virginia’s constitution, and had then made his finalrevision for the Continental Congress. In that sense, he was the mostexperienced prosecutor the congress could have appointed to make the caseagainst George III.25 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts25]Jefferson completed his draft of the Declaration sometime during the third weekof June. (Adams later remembered, perhaps exaggerating, that it took him only “aday or two.”) He showed that draft to Adams and Franklin, two of the mostprominent leaders in the congress, whose judgment he respected. They suggestedonly one change. Instead of “We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable,”they made the truths “self-evident,” an alteration that Jefferson apparentlyaccepted as an improvement.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts26]Then the committee placed the document before the full congress on June 28. (Thefamous painting by John Trumbull that hangs in the Capitol Rotunda, titled TheDeclaration of Independence, depicts this moment, not July 4 as most viewerspresume.) A debate then ensued (July 1–2) on the Virginia Resolution forindependence, in which John Dickinson spoke eloquently for delay, repeating themoderate mantra that diplomacy had not yet run its course, that secession fromthe British Empire meant war against the most formidable military power on theplanet, and that any attempt to conjure up the vision of an independent Americanrepublic produced only a series of political nightmares in his mind. Unfortunatefor Dickinson’s message, indeed fatal for his increasingly anachronistic agenda,was the quite real nightmare of British troops and ships assembling on StatenIsland, which did not need to be conjured up. Adams argued, in his bestCiceronian style, that the time for American independence had obviously arrived.(It was the most significant speech in Adams’s long political career but wasdelivered without notes, and no record of it exists.) The vote was nearlyunanimous, 12–0, with the New Yorkers abstaining on the grounds that they werestill bound by the instructions of their legislature. Then the congressimmediately put itself into a committee-of-the-whole format in order to debateJefferson’s draft.27 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts27]Over the next two days, the committee made eighty-five revisions or deletions inthe text, a rather remarkable editorial feat that, most historians haveconcluded, improved the clarity and cogency of the final document. Jefferson, onthe other hand, sat silently and sullenly throughout the debate, regarding eachrevision as a defacement. At one point Franklin leaned over to console him,reminding Jefferson that this was the reason he never wrote anything that wouldbe edited by a committee. On July 4 the congress approved its revised version,and the Declaration of Independence was sent to the printer for publication.There was no signing ceremony on that day, as Jefferson later claimed. Theparchment copy was signed by most members on August 2.28[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts28]The major editorial changes all occurred in the lengthy grievances section ofthe document, which the delegates focused on for the understandable reason thatit provided the political and legal rationale for independence; this was, afterall, the whole point of the Declaration. The delegates found three of thecharges against George III either too Virginian or too Jeffersonian for theirtaste.First, Jefferson accused George III of waging “cruel war against human natureitself, by rejecting efforts to end the slave trade,” then “exciting those verypeople [i.e., slaves] to rise in arms against us … by murdering the people onwhom he has also obtruded them.” This was Jefferson’s attempt to rephraseVirginia’s somewhat tortured claim that the slave trade, and implicitly slaveryitself, was the fault of George III, and that he was also to blame for LordDunmore’s offer of emancipation to Virginia’s slaves, a purportedly criminalact.This might have made sense in the Old Dominion, where the plantations wereoverstocked; so ending the slave trade was popular among the Tidewater elite,though ending slavery itself was unimaginable. But in the Deep South, mostespecially in South Carolina, ending the slave trade was a deal breaker. And forall the states north of the Potomac, the very inclusion of slavery in the billof indictment was inadmissible, even more so when coupled with condemnation ofDunmore’s emancipation proposal, which contradicted the antislavery implicationsof the paragraph. Best to delete the entire passage and let slavery remain theunmentionable elephant in the center of the room.29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts29]Second, Jefferson attempted to insert one of his own fondest beliefs into thedraft, which he had developed more fully in Summary View. He called it thedoctrine of “expatriation,” and it claimed that the original English migrants toAmerica came “at the expense of our own blood and treasure; unassisted by thestrength of Great Britain … but that submission to their parliament was no partof our constitution.” In Jefferson’s scenario, the American colonists were alldescendants of the Saxon race, itself with origins in the Germanic forests,where all coercive forms of government were rejected as despotic, so all claimsof royal or parliamentary authority over American colonists were latter-dayviolations of the original understanding. This represented a rather preposterousrewriting of American colonial history in the once-upon-a-time mode, and theContinental Congress struck it out as an embarrassing piece of romanticfiction.30 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts30]Third, and finally, the end of Jefferson’s draft featured a highly emotionalcondemnation of George III for abdicating his role as affectionate parent by“sending over not only soldiers of our common blood but Scotch & foreignmercenaries to invade and destroy us.” Parental love had somehow been replacedby despotic cruelty: “These facts have given the last stab to agonizingaffection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeelingbrethren.” Jefferson was trying to give expression to the multiple resolutionsfrom state, town, and county precincts that lamented the sudden transformationof George III from benevolent monarch into belligerent tyrant. That really wasthe dominant message conveyed by ordinary Americans, and its inclusion suggeststhat Jefferson had been reading the resolutions pouring into the congress inresponse to the May 15 request. But the Jeffersonian version of the messagestruck most members of the congress as excessively sentimental. So it too wasdeleted.31 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts31]THE MOST IMPORTANT OCCURRENCE during the editorial debate within the congresswas an event that did not happen, another dog that did not bark. Fixated as theywere on the long grievances section, the delegates ignored altogether the firsttwo paragraphs of the text, which they presumably regarded as Jefferson’srhetorical overture, the flamboyant windup before the real pitch. They made nocomment whatsoever on the following words:We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; thatthey are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that amongthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure theserights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers fromthe consent of the governed.32 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts32]Since these were destined to become the most important fifty-five words inAmerican history, the seminal statement of the “American Creed,” and perhaps themost inspiring words in all of modern history, it is difficult for us tocomprehend the total indifference and inattention of the delegates. But that isbecause we possess the advantage of hindsight and therefore realize what thenatural rights section of the Declaration would eventually become. Starting inthe 1790s, several prominent Americans began to notice the implications ofJefferson’s language, but the culmination of the creeded interpretation of thedocument was articulated by Abraham Lincoln in 1859:All honor to Jefferson—to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a strugglefor national independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecaste, andcapacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document, an abstract truth,and so to embalm it there, that today and in all coming days, it shall be arebuke and a stumbling block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny andoppression.33 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts33]But what Lincoln, surely with tongue in cheek, called “a merely revolutionarydocument” was for all the delegates in Philadelphia the whole point of theexercise and the major reason why the document is called the Declaration ofIndependence. Lincoln’s phrase “embalm it there” implies that Jefferson knewwhat he was doing, but there is no evidence that he did. His primary attentionover the ensuing weeks was devoted to ensuring that his unedited draft—that is,before it was “mangled” by his fellow delegates—was preserved for posterity, butthat meant focusing exclusively on his language in the grievances section.34[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts34]Nevertheless, what Jefferson had done, albeit inadvertently, was to smuggle theradical implications of the American Revolution into the founding document,planting the seeds that would grow into the expanding liberal mandate forindividual rights that eventually ended the property qualification to vote,ended slavery, made women’s suffrage inevitable, and sanctioned the civil rightsof all racial minorities. Adams had worried himself sick that all the state,county, and town resolutions of May and June would raise this radical agenda,and in the process complicate the all-important vote on independence. NowJefferson’s lofty and lyrical prose had surreptitiously inserted the latentimplications of the American Revolution into the Declaration so deftly that noone noticed. Before he died in 1826, Jefferson had begun to glimpse ever sofaintly what he had done, insisting that “Author of the Declaration ofIndependence” top the list of achievements engraved on his tombstone.As the core statement of America’s most elemental principles, the natural rightssection of the Declaration has stood the test of time, just as Lincoln predictedit would. And it has done so for reasons that Lincoln was one of the first tofully comprehend.For while the idea that governments derive their authority from the consent ofthe governed is clearly indebted to John Locke’s formulation of the doctrine and“the right of revolution” that followed from it in his Second Treatise onGovernment (1688), a more utopian dimension lurks in the second paragraph of theDeclaration that is very much an expression of Jefferson’s imagination. Itenvisions a perfect world, at last bereft of kings, priests, and even governmentitself. In this never-never land, free individuals interact harmoniously, allforms of political coercion are unnecessary because they have been voluntarilyinternalized, people pursue their own different versions of happiness withoutcolliding, and some semblance of social equality reigns supreme. As Lincolnrecognized, it is an ideal world that can never be reached on this earth, onlyapproached. And each generation had an obligation to move America an incrementcloser to the full promise, as Lincoln most famously did. The American Dream,then, is the Jeffersonian Dream writ large, embedded in language composed duringone of the most crowded and congested moments in American history by anidealistic young man who desperately wished to be somewhere else.IN ONE OF THOSE chronological coincidences that would not be believed infiction, the first wave of the British fleet carrying General William Howe andhis 9,000 troops was sighted off the Long Island coast on June 28, the day thedrafting committee presented the Declaration to the Continental Congress. As thefleet approached, sentries in the Continental Army were stunned by its size: 113ships led by Howe’s flagship, Greyhound. “I thought all London was afloat,”exclaimed one of the sentries. Little did he know that Admiral Howe was comingon with an even larger fleet.35 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts35]After an initial probe of the Long Island coast, General Howe decided thatStaten Island was a more secure location. Troops began to disembark there onJuly 2, the day the congress voted on independence, and completed the landing onJuly 4, the day the Declaration was approved and sent out to the world. As theHowes were soon to discover, by arriving just as the climactic vote onindependence was cast, their preferred role as peace commissioners becamedecidedly more problematic, because now they would not be asking Americancolonists to avoid taking that fateful step, but rather asking Americans who nolonger regarded themselves as colonists to reconsider their decision.Although Washington had been worried about New York’s tactical vulnerability forweeks, the actual presence of the enormous British force was now striking homemuch in the manner of his worst nightmare. He put his entire army on alert,assuming that Howe intended to attack immediately, especially after loyalistspies had apprised him of the location and unfinished condition of the Americandefenses. He did not yet realize that Howe had prudently decided to wait for hisbrother’s arrival with a much larger force.The political drama reaching a climax in Philadelphia now had its militaryequivalent in New York, with the sharp edge of life-and-death danger building upfor all to see. Obviously shaken, and not yet aware of what was transpiring inPhiladelphia, Washington summoned up his own rhetorical energies in his GeneralOrders on July 2, in his own way matching Jefferson’s visionary message andtone:The time is now at hand which must probably determine, Whether Americans are tobe, Freeman, or Slaves; whether they are to have any property they can calltheir own; whether their Houses and Farms are to be pillaged and destroyed, andthey consigned to a State of Wretchedness from which no human efforts willprobably deliver them. The fate of the unborn Millions will now depend, underGod, on the conduct of this army.… Let us therefore animate and encourage eachother, and show the whole world, that a Freeman contending for Liberty on hisown ground is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth.36[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts36]This was Washington’s own declaration, rendered pressingly relevant by therecognition that Jefferson’s Declaration would be quickly forgotten if the warwas lost that same summer. The ideals that Jefferson had so eloquentlyarticulated were designed to be universal and eternal. But whether they wouldendure forever or die an early death over the next few weeks was a question soonto be decided by soldiers on the battlefield and not by an inspired youngstatesman in his study."},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 4[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]ETC., ETC., ETC.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I consider this War against us therefore, as both unjust, and unwise, and I ampersuaded that cool dispassionate Posterity will condemn to Infamy those whoadvised it; and that not even Success will save from some degree of Dishonour,those who voluntarily engaged to conduct it.—BENJAMIN FRANKLIN TO LORD RICHARD HOWE, July 20, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The men disembarking onto Staten Island had just endured a harrowing monthlongordeal at sea that eventually proved more dangerous than any of the battles theywould fight on land. The close quarters, poor diet, and bad sanitary conditionshad created outbreaks of malaria and accompanying high casualty rates. Slightlymore than 1,000 soldiers and sailors had been buried at sea, together withalmost as many horses and livestock. In most military histories, the termkilling zone refers to that most lethal location on the battlefield whereadvancing troops are exposed to waves of metal projectiles propelled at highvelocity from the state-of-the-art weapons of mass destruction. But in the lateeighteenth century, and for more than a hundred years thereafter, the mostlethal “killing zones” were the hospitals and confined conditions aboard ships,where the weapons of mass destruction were germs, microbes, and viral strainsagainst which medical science had yet to develop any defensive network ofprevention or cure. Leaving those disease-ridden ships for the bucolic hills andclean air of Staten Island meant that for the British Army the most dangerouspart of the American campaign was over.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts1]Ambrose Serle, the secretary to Admiral Howe, has left the fullest account ofhis impressions of Staten Island. “The People of this Island, like their Soil,are thin and meager; the Voices faint, and their whole Frame of a loose andlanguid texture,” Serle observed, adding that “the Soil is mostly poor, andreceives a very inferior Cultivation than our Lands in G. Britain.” Serleobviously observed the people and overall American environment, which he hadnever seen before, through the lens of presumed superiority and studiedcondescension appropriate for an overbearing British aristocrat. It was all partof the mental package he carried from the London courts and Whitehall corridors,where American resistance to British authority was regarded as a preposterousviolation of the divinely sanctioned political order and George Washington wasviewed, in Serle’s words, “as a little paltry Colonel of Militia at the Head ofa Banditti of Rebels.”2 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts2]If Serle’s political prejudices were just as predictable as they wereinsufferable—and, in truth, they provided a nice window into one reason Americanindependence had become inevitable—ordinary British soldiers harbored severalstrange preconceptions of their own. Some were surprised that the colonists woreclothes, thinking they would dress like Indians. Others had expected toencounter roving bands of wild animals in the manner of African jungles. Andwhen a loyalist came aboard one ship to help pilot it into port, the Britishcrew and troops were dumbfounded. “All the People had been of the Opinion,” theyexclaimed, “that the inhabitants of America were black.”3[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts3]But the dominant impressions were more sensible and strategic. The Staten Islandlandscape was dotted with highly productive farms and impressive herds of cattleand sheep that—Serle’s comments to the contrary notwithstanding—ensured animmediate improvement in the diet of the soldiers of the British Army. Indeed,given their recent experience crossing the Atlantic, the British troops could beexcused for believing that they had arrived at paradise.To top it off, the local inhabitants greeted them as long-awaited rescuersrather than as hostile invaders. Over the preceding months, all attempts toassess the political allegiance of farmers on Long Island and Staten Island hadproduced only muffled guesses, which accurately conveyed the multilayeredpolitical disposition of the populace. Outright loyalists and patriots werevastly outnumbered by simple farmers who only wished that the two armies wouldgo somewhere else to kill each other. But with the arrival of General Howe’smassive force, popular opinion shifted overnight. American sentries lookingthrough their telescopes from the southern coast of Long Island reported thatthe residents of Staten Island had not really surrendered so much as converted,enthusiastically joining the other side. Very soon the various “joinings”included sexual unions occurring throughout the rolling hills and apple orchardsof the island. “The fair nymphs of this isle are in a wonderful tribulation,”reported one British officer. “A girl cannot step into the bushes to pluck arose without running the imminent risk of being ravished.” Court-martial casesinvolving accusations of rape became daily occurrences at British headquarters.4[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts4]To a surprising degree, the British soldiers encamped on Staten Island resembledtheir American counterparts on Long Island and Manhattan. Contrary to a negativestereotype that developed in the next century during the emergence of theBritish Empire at the height of its power, the British Army was not a collectionof outcasts, criminals, and psychopaths swept into service from the jails andbars of London or dragooned from English towns and villages. They were, instead,working-class Britons—former day laborers, farmers, carpenters, andshoemakers—who had the misfortune to have become victims of the IndustrialRevolution, their jobs displaced by machines, thereby making the army theemployer of last resort. They were almost all volunteers.The big difference between the enlisted men of the British and American armieswas age and experience. The typical British soldier was twenty-eight years old,his American counterpart almost eight years younger. And most important, theredcoat had seven years of experience as a soldier, while the American had lessthan six months, and those in several units of the Continental Army had nonewhatsoever.5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts5]It came down to proven experience in battle, which on the eighteenth-centurybattlefield placed a premium on remaining calm amid scenes of unspeakablecarnage and horror. “To march over dead men, to hear without concern the groansof the wounded,” Nathanael Greene meditated, “I say few men can stand suchscenes unless steeled by habit or fortified by military pride.” Many of theBritish soldiers, and even more of the Hessians, had shown they could pass thattest. The Americans were as yet untried.6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts6]In an effort to buoy the spirit of his troops, Washington had on severaloccasions questioned the motivation of British regulars. They were meremercenaries fighting for money. The Americans were patriots fighting for thenoble goal of independence. This quasi-religious message had a point, but itmisconstrued the motivation of ordinary soldiers on the British side, who shareda deep-felt affection for their respective regiments and for the men standing tothe right and left of them in battle. British soldiers saw and felt themselvesas a brotherhood prepared to share some of the most excruciating experiences oflife together. The regiment was their family, and they were prepared to defendits honor whatever the cost.ON JULY 9, Washington received a packet of documents from Hancock, along withthe following cover letter:The Congress have judged it necessary to dissolve the connection between GreatBritain and the American Colonies, and to declare them free & independentstates; as you will perceive by the enclosed Declaration, which I am directed totransmit to you, and to request that you will have it proclaimed at the Head ofthe Army in the Way you shall think it most proper.7[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts7]News that independence had been declared had reached Washington two daysearlier, but this was the official communication from the civilian head of thegovernment to the military commander, along with the document itself. Washingtonmade no comment on the language of the Declaration, preferring to regard thewords as the long-awaited political commitment that at last aligned theContinental Congress with the Continental Army. He ordered it read aloud to allthe troops after dinner that evening on the New York City Commons and on severalbrigade parade grounds.The reading on the commons was greeted with “three Huzzas from the Troops,” whothen joined a large crowd of civilians that marched down Broadway to BowlingGreen to tear down a massive statue of George III. It was made of lead gilded ingold and depicted the king on horseback clad as a Roman emperor. Only astrenuous effort with crowbars and ropes could budge the two-ton monument. Afterbeheading their former sovereign, the lead was hauled away to make 42,000 musketballs, one witness relishing the prospect that “redcoats will have meltedmajesty fired at them.” In his General Orders the following day, Washingtonreprimanded his troops for joining the crowd in the wanton act of destructionagainst the last vestige of royal authority. No one took this reprimandseriously, including Washington himself, who ordered no investigation orpunishment of the offenders.8 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts8]DURING THE WANING WEEKS of July, Washington continued his practice of buildingup his networks of defense, both on Long Island and inside his own soul. Asominous as the British encampment on Staten Island appeared, it soon began toprovide reliable intelligence, from British deserters and from Americanloyalists on the island having second thoughts. Greene obtained informationabout the size and arrival time of Admiral Richard Howe’s approaching fleet,plus General William Howe’s tactical plans to launch his main invasion on LongIsland.9 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts9]These precious bits of information allowed Washington to fill in the blanks ofhis defensive scheme with more confidence than guesswork. Moreover, by mid-Julyhe had obtained accurate intelligence about Germain’s strategic plan for theconduct of the entire war. “As it now seems beyond question,” Washingtoninformed Hancock, “that the Enemy mean to direct their Operations against thisColony, and will attempt to unite their two Armies, that under General Burgoyne[coming down from Canada] and the one arrived here.” The looming invasion of NewYork, then, was the southern half of a coordinated British strategy to capturethe Hudson corridor and isolate New England.10[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts10]This helps explain the otherwise inexplicable attention Washington devoted tothe hapless and apparently hopeless American military efforts in upstate NewYork commanded by General Philip Schuyler, which dominated his correspondencefor days at a time at the expense of attention to the more conspicuous andvisible British threat only six miles away. Knowing Germain’s overall strategyforced Washington to broaden his vision in order to counter the British buildupnorth of Lake Champlain. In retrospect, he would have been better offconcentrating his attention on his more immediate adversary.11[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts11]On July 12 he proceeded to do precisely that. Knowing as he did that AdmiralHowe’s fleet was due later that very day, Washington convened a council of warto consider a strike against the British garrison in Staten Island before it wasreinforced. Rather than just sit and watch as the flower of the British army andnavy assembled and prepared to deliver a crushing blow, Washington proposed thatthe Continental Army take the offensive and deliver its own blow before AdmiralHowe’s fleet was securely ensconced.It was a bold idea that accurately reflected Washington’s aggressive militaryinstincts. A plan was drafted in Lord Stirling’s hand calling for a coordinatedassault on Staten Island by 3,300 American troops at six separate landing spots.It presumed split-second timing and a wholly unrealistic level of coordinationthat would have tested the most experienced professional army in the world.Given the inexperience and conspicuous disarray throughout the Continental Army,the plan resembled a textbook example of how to orchestrate a disaster. It wasalso the first of Washington’s inherently overcomplicated offensive schemes thatwould bedevil the Continental Army throughout the war. The question put to thecouncil of war was clear and succinct: Should the army mount an attack on StatenIsland? The answer came back with equivalent clarity: “Agreed unanimously thatit should not.” Complicated tactical attacks were not yet part of theContinental Army’s repertoire. Washington backed off.12[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts12]Even before that decision could be digested, Admiral Howe’s flagship, the Eagle,was sighted on the horizon, signaling the arrival of the main British fleet andforce. A few hours later two British men-of-war, the Phoenix and the Rose,accompanied by three tenders, took advantage of the favorable winds and tides tosail past Red Hook and Governors Island up the Hudson, guns blazing all the wayup the west side of Manhattan. Cannonballs came crashing through houses,scattering the terrified residents in the streets, while the soldiers in theContinental Army watched in disbelief from the shoreline as the Royal Navyoffered an exhibition of its matchless firepower. American batteries got offnearly two hundred shots as the ships glided past, but to little avail—theyswept past the major gun emplacements at Fort Washington and cruised thirtymiles upstream before dropping anchor at the Tappan Zee that evening.13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts13]A recently arrived recruit from Connecticut, only fifteen years old, by the nameof Joseph Plumb Martin, noted that he had just seen his first action, whichstruck him as complete chaos. He had never witnessed cannonfire before but wasprepared to testify that “the sound was musical, or at least grand.” He wasmesmerized.14 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts14]In his General Orders the next day, Washington focused on the dazed response oftroops, like Private Martin, who did not behave according to orders by repairingto their posts but instead just stood there in frozen amazement. “Suchunsoldierly conduct must grieve every good officer,” Washington lectured, notingthat it did not bode well for “The Cause” once serious fighting started.15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts15]But the most foreboding fact about the action that day was the ease with whichthe British ships had sailed past all the American batteries. In this first testof those elaborately constructed forts and gun emplacements designed to limitBritish naval mobility around Manhattan, the American defenses had failedmiserably. This meant that British ships could move with virtual impunitythroughout the New York archipelago, delivering troops and firepower whereverthey wished, making a mockery of Washington’s static defenses. Most ominously,it meant that if Manhattan was a bottle, the British could cork it at theirpleasure, landing troops on the north end of the island and trappingWashington’s entire army without any avenue of escape. It meant that GeneralLee’s original assessment was correct: British naval supremacy made New Yorkindefensible.Hindsight suggests that these revelations should have prompted a fundamentalreview of American strategy, leading to the abandonment of New York andwithdrawal of the Continental Army onto the American mainland in either NewJersey or Connecticut. But hindsight was not available to Washington, who wastrapped in the moment much as his army was trapped on two islands. It was clearthat the Continental Congress expected him to defend New York at all costs. Itwas equally clear that his civilian superiors in Philadelphia did not understandwhat “at all costs” might mean.Throughout July he devoted his fullest energies to assessing several schemesdesigned to limit British naval mobility on the Hudson and East rivers. Heresponded enthusiastically to a proposal from the Pennsylvania Committee ofSafety for the creation of six “fire ships” that would ram and sink Britishfrigates in a naval version of “forlorn hope,” or suicidal tactics. Heentertained the prospect of blocking ships in the channels of the Hudson withhuge piles of debris called chevaux-de-frise, creating underwater blockades thatwould force British vessels to slow down and maneuver within the range ofAmerican guns at strongpoints like Fort Washington. He even listened to aproposal, forwarded to him through Benjamin Franklin, for the deployment of anew kind of ship called a submarine, which would sink beneath the surface, thenpop up to wreak havoc among unsuspecting British ships. He was obviouslysearching for a way to offset the tactical advantages enjoyed by the Britishfleet, grasping at straws to reduce the odds against him.16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts16]The sheer volume of requests landing on his desk made it impossible forWashington to concentrate his attention on the larger picture. There were, itturned out, about fifteen thousand cattle, sheep, and horses on Long Island, allbelonging to local farmers. Should his army confiscate them to prevent them fromfalling into British hands? What impact would such confiscation have on thepolitical allegiance of the farmers? After much back-and-forthing, all thelivestock on Long Island were rounded up and slaughtered, which amounted toWashington’s tacit recognition that Long Island was likely to fall into Britishhands.17 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts17]Then there was the pressing and awkward question of what to do about the localloyalists. It was pressing because, according to Greene’s estimate, severalhundred residents of Long Island were currently hiding in the woods and swamps,waiting to join the British invasion force once it landed. It was awkwardbecause within New York City, a substantial segment of the population, includingsome of the most prominent citizens, refused to acknowledge the new realitycreated by the Declaration of Independence and insisted on straddling the divideas British Americans who refused to choose. Eventually it was decided that allstraddlers should be treated as loyalists and jailed, and the most suspiciouscharacters should be transported to Connecticut in order to prevent theirliberation if the British should occupy the city. Greene ordered a clean sweepof all the households on Long Island, done with decorum in order to avoid theappearance of harshness or insensitivity toward sincere neutrals. The arrestingofficers should be “decently dressed” and should avoid any expression of“indecency or abuse to any person.” The sheep had to be separated from the goatsfor obvious military reasons, but Greene wanted to accomplish his missionwithout becoming the American bully who alienated the very people he hoped torescue.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts18]Washington’s chief accomplice in managing the cascading array of daily demandswas Joseph Reed, a thirty-five-year-old veteran of the Boston Siege whomWashington had plucked from the ranks to serve as an aide because of his obviousintelligence and educational background. (Reed had studied law at London’sMiddle Temple.) When Reed decided in April to return to his family and lawpractice in Philadelphia, Washington was disappointed, since he had come toregard the young man as an indispensable member of his official “family,” whosejudgment and writing ability had become invaluable. In June he lured him backinto service with an offer of higher rank, as adjutant general, the chiefadministrative office in the Continental Army. Almost immediately Reedrecognized that he was in over his head. “The office I am in,” he wrote hiswife, “is so entirely out of my line, that I do not feel myself so easy init.”19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts19]In addition to his inexperience—like Greene and Knox, Reed was another one ofWashington’s gifted amateurs—he was responsible for administering an army thatlacked time-tested procedures and routinized policies, so that every decisionbecame an improvisational act. The intense concern within the officer corpsabout rank, for example, reflected the evolving criteria for promotion, whichproduced persistent bickering, mountains of paperwork, and scores of bruisedegos. Militia units from Connecticut that insisted on bringing their horses hadto be sent home because the Continental Army had no way of accommodating acavalry regiment. Reed tried to transform the lack of cloth for uniforms into anadvantage, ordering the soldiers to make their own “Hunting Shirts,” which mightterrify the British, “who think every such person a complete marksman.” Knox’sartillery regiment had more cannons than men who could load and fire themsafely. The standard-size musket balls and flints used in the Continental Armydid not fit the muskets carried by several militia regiments. Surgeons at theregimental hospitals demanded the authority to admit or dismiss patients withoutapproval from superior officers, but to no avail.20[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts20]Reed’s main job was to prevent all these nettlesome problems from landing onWashington’s desk. He surely did the best he could, but given the inexperiencedcondition of the army, even the most experienced British officer would have beenhard-pressed to manage the flow. And beyond the unscripted administrativeburdens, the Continental Army itself was actually designed as a permanentlytransitory improvisation that would expand and contract on a battle-by-battlebasis, when the core force of regulars would be supplemented by militia fromproximate states.This meant that over half the total strength of the army was comprised of newlyarrived volunteers who somehow had to be folded into the military plans andorganizational charts at the last minute. This logistical nightmare defied anycoherent solution, only adding a final layer of confusion and loose ends to thetangled mass of men and equipment called the Continental Army. No single mindcould comprehend it all, much less control it. Swamped every day with vexingrequests from countless quarters, Washington took refuge from the incessantbarrage in the impenetrable bunker of his own mind, where all the options wereuncompromisingly clear and blissfully elemental. “If they will stand by me, theplace cannot be taken without some loss,” he wrote his brother, adding thecaveat, “notwithstanding we are not yet in a posture of defense I shouldwish.”21 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts21]CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE of events: on July 12, Lord Howe’s fleet with20,000 British troops arrived in Long Island Sound; on that same day, HisMajesty’s Phoenix and Rose blazed their way up the Hudson, demonstrating thetactical supremacy of the British navy and the abiding vulnerability of theAmerican defensive scheme; the following day, Lord Howe sent a letter toWashington via a courier, announcing “the Commission with which I have the honorto be charged,” referring to his appointment as one of the two peacecommissioners—his brother was the other—purportedly carrying proposals fromGeorge III and the British ministry for diplomatic negotiations that wouldrender all those ships and soldiers superfluous. “I trust that a dispassionateconsideration of the King’s benevolent intentions may be the means of preventingthe further Effusion of Blood,” Lord Richard fondly hoped, “and becomeproductive of Peace and lasting Union between Great Britain and America.” Onewould be challenged to find a more dramatic example of the iron fist and thevelvet glove—or perhaps the sword and the olive branch—in all of ancient andmodern statecraft.22 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts22]But the letter could not be delivered. Howe’s courier and Joseph Reed met inrowboats between Staten Island and Governors Island. After pleasantries wereshouted over the wind and waves, Reed refused to accept the letter because itwas addressed to “George Washington Esq. &c, &c, &c.” No such person existed inthe Continental Army, Reed declared, adding that “all the World knew who Genl.Washington was since the transactions of last summer,” presumably referring toWashington’s appointment as commander in chief of the Continental Army. Reed’slegal training served him well during this diplomatic exchange, emboldening himto reject any solicitation that failed to acknowledge the legal status of hisclient.23 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts23]So the courier returned the letter undelivered, prompting a tantrum from AmbroseSerle, Lord Howe’s secretary. “So high is the Vanity and Insolence of theseMen,” Serle recorded in his journal, “they Dare to rebut Lord Howe, whoseBravery & Honor are So well known…[and] they pretend (or rather have pretended)to seek Peace, and yet renounce it.” Washington wrote to Hancock the next day tojustify Reed’s conduct during the interview, explaining that the decision toreject Howe’s letter involved more than mere etiquette. “I would not upon anyoccasion sacrifice Essentials to Punctilio,” Washington observed, “but in thisInstance … I deemed it a duty to my Countrymen and my appointment to insist uponthat respect which in any other than a public view I would willingly havewaived.”24 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts24]In truth, Lord Howe’s inability to address Washington by rank, though onlysymbolic, captured the essence of the diplomatic impasse, for Germain’sinstructions explicitly prohibited Howe from treating the Americans as equals oreven from negotiating at all until after the rebels threw down their arms andsurrendered. Both Howe brothers would have preferred a more roving mandate, butboth had been forced to come to terms with Germain’s narrow restrictions, andthey had reluctantly concluded that any peace initiative could occur only afterinflicting a decisive defeat on Washington’s army.Apparently, Lord Howe had decided to make one bold effort before the battle.Perhaps he thought that the very sight of the massive invasion force mightweaken Washington’s resolve. And it is possible, though pure speculation, thatHowe dispatched the two warships up the Hudson in order to demonstrate toWashington the hopelessness of his military situation. Whatever Howe’s motives,they had no effect on Washington’s resolute posture of defiance, nor on hislong-standing conviction that the whole business of peace commissioners was apolitical ploy designed to give false hope to die-hard reconciliationists: “LordHowe is arrived,” Washington informed General Horatio Gates, currently trying toimpose some semblance of discipline on the northern detachment of theContinental Army. “He & the Genl his Brother are appointed Commissioners todispense Pardons to Repenting Sinners.”25[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts25]Lord Howe was obviously exasperated, on the one hand by the short leash thatGermain had allowed him, and on the other by the apparent obliviousness ofWashington, who was rejecting the opportunity to avert what was most assuredlygoing to be a military catastrophe. He decided to make one final attempt a weeklater, this time sending his adjutant general, James Patterson, with the sameletter, plus a generous proposal about prisoner exchange. Reed determined thatthe prisoner issue afforded a pretext for a face-to-face interview withWashington, so Patterson was led, blindfolded, to Washington’s headquarters onManhattan. Patterson had been briefed to address Washington as “His Excellency,”to treat him with the utmost respect, and to assure him that the Howes had beengranted great powers to effect an accommodation. This was demonstrably untrue,as Washington was quick to point out, observing that George III’s vauntedgenerosity lay on the other side of American capitulation, so all the Howes hadto offer were pardons, “and that those who had committed no Fault, wanted noPardon.” Patterson conveyed Lord Howe’s deep disappointment that matters couldnot move past this initial sticking point, reiterated the regret of both Howesabout not recognizing the rank of a man whose “Person & Character they held inthe highest Esteem,” then bowed himself out the door, “Sociable and Chatty allthe way.”26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts26]The chasm between the British and American positions was now exposed more fullythan ever before. From the British side of the divide, all assumptions remainedresolutely imperial. Despite over ten years of political conflict during whichthe colonies challenged Parliament’s sovereignty and called for some kind ofsemiautonomous American presence within the British Empire, then fifteen monthsof bloodletting that raised the stakes for both sides, George III and hisministers continued to insist that the colonists were subjects, not citizens,and that Parliament’s sovereignty was nonnegotiable. No compromise was possiblebecause nothing less than the survival of the British Empire in North Americawas at stake. And no compromise was necessary because the British army and navy,so conspicuously poised on Staten Island, were invincible.Only within this imperial context was George III prepared to be charitable, notbecause he was required to do so but because, so the Howes claimed, he retaineda benevolent sense of affection for his American subjects and wished to envelopthem once again within the protective folds of his kingship. That meant that hewas prepared to issue a blanket pardon to the vast majority of Americancolonists once they relinquished their misguided claim to independence,disbanded their army, and disavowed those radical ringleaders in the ContinentalCongress and Continental Army who had generated so much of the recent mischief.These were the true culprits, who must, of course, be rounded up, be tried fortreason, and suffer the consequences. After the old order was restored, GeorgeIII was prepared to listen to fresh proposals for some sensible framework ofpolitical reform designed to keep his subjects happy.The view from the American side of the divide was most eloquently expressed byBenjamin Franklin, who knew Richard Howe from their days together in London,when they were both vainly seeking a political compromise that avoided an openbreak. Writing from Philadelphia on July 20, Franklin commiserated with LordRichard’s predicament, lamenting that he was precluded from offering any peaceterms other than “Offers of Pardon upon submission; which I was sorry to find,as it must give your Lordship Pain to be sent so far on so hopeless a Business.”No other delegate—indeed, no other American—could have written such words, whichdeftly reversed the British and American roles, commiserating with Lord Richardfor the hopelessness of his position. The style came naturally to Franklin, whohad been practicing it for nearly fifty years, first as the folksy Poor Richardwith his arsenal of witty maxims (e.g., “Let all men know thee, but no man knowthee thoroughly”), most recently in a devastating satire of British statecraft,Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One (1773).Franklin was, in fact, a latecomer to the cause of American independence. Formost of the last two decades he had lived in London, lobbying for a royalcharter for Pennsylvania, receiving the accolades of the Royal Society for hispioneering work on electricity, and rubbing elbows with the leading figures ofBritish society, Lord Richard included. He presumed that the British Empire wasreally an Anglo-American empire of partners, bound together by mutual consentand common interest. When the recently crowned George III and a succession ofBritish ministries began to tighten restrictions on colonial trade, impose newtaxes, and station a standing army in America, Franklin regarded these changesas a temporary aberration. Only a pack of fools would seek to destroy animperial relationship that worked so smoothly and boded so well for both sidesas members of an emerging global power.By 1773 he was beginning to conclude that the British government no longer knewits own interest. The clinching moment came in January 1774, when he wasrequired to sit silently in the House of Lords while he was pilloried andpersonally insulted for advocating his vision of a British Empire based on theprinciple of mutual consent. This searing experience prompted a conversion tothe goal of American independence. He returned to America in 1775, wasimmediately elected to the Continental Congress, and never looked back. If JohnAdams was the hands-on architect of the movement for independence in thecongress, Franklin was the acknowledged elder statesman, a generation or twoolder than most other delegates, who brought the resolve of a recent convert,the weight of his reputation, and even the status of a celebrity to thedeliberations. If Washington was the new American hero, Franklin was the mostfamiliar and famous American of the century.27[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts27]His message to Lord Richard Howe, then, carried a special resonance that couldnot be dismissed, even though it undermined everything that Lord Richard hopedto accomplish. The notion that the British government was prepared to pardon therecalcitrant colonists was preposterously presumptive, Franklin observed, sincethat very government “had behaved with the most wanton Barbarity and Cruelty,burnt our defenseless Towns in the midst of winter, excited the Savages tomassacre our farmers … and is even now bringing foreign Mercenaries to delugeour Settlements with Blood.” The moral leverage to grant pardons belonged to theAmerican side, “since it is not possible for you (I mean the British Nation) toforgive the People you have so heavily injured.”If Lord Richard had carried proposals for peace between two sovereign powerscurrently at war, Franklin continued, then perhaps negotiations would bepossible. “But I am persuaded you have no such Powers,” he observed, becauseBritain could not recognize the separate and independent existence of her formercolonies as equal states without abandoning her presumed supremacy. And if thatsupremacy then took a military form, as it was now doing, it only exposed thehypocrisy of all British claims of generosity. It did not help the good lord’scause that he was simultaneously a peace commissioner and co-leader of aninvasion.Whatever the outcome of the current contest at New York, Franklin predicted thatBritain’s war against America would prove unwinnable and “so destructive both ofLives and Treasure, that must prove as pernicious to her in the End as theCroisades [Crusades] formerly were to most of the Nations of Europe.” Like allhis former predictions, this one, Franklin realized, would not be believed “tillthe Event shall verify it.” Rather than invincible, British arms would proveinadequate.Franklin concluded with a piece of unsolicited advice to Howe. It pained him tofind his former friend prosecuting a war destined to go down in history asunnecessary, unwise, and unjust. “Posterity will condemn to Infamy those whoadvised it,” he warned, “and that not even Success will save from some degree ofDishnour, those who voluntarily engaged to conduct it.” Franklin was prepared togrant that Howe’s “great Motive in coming hither was the Hope of beinginstrumental in a Reconciliation.” Now that it was clear that reconciliation wasimpossible on the terms Lord Richard was permitted to propose, he should“relinquish so odious a Command and return to a more honourable privatestation.”28 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts28]Of course, Lord Richard could hardly hear Franklin’s advice, much less take it.A few weeks later he wrote Germain: “The interview [with Washington] was morepolite than interesting; however it induced me to change my subscription for theattainment of an end desirable.” This was his elliptical way of acknowledgingthat no peace was possible until the Americans had been taught a painful andbloody lesson, which would now become his chief task.29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts29]At Franklin’s urging, the Continental Congress forwarded Lord Richard’s peaceproposals to several major newspapers, in order to expose his limited powers anddash any false hopes that still lingered in the ever-dwindling number ofmoderate minds. If there ever had been a middle position, a bridge over thechasm, it was now completely gone.30[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts30]IN EARLY AUGUST, the gathering storm continued to gather. On August 1, Greenereported the arrival of thirty ships at Sandy Hook, which he took to be theGerman mercenaries but turned out to be generals Clinton and Cornwallis comingup from South Carolina. Another small fleet arrived a week later, containing thefirst wave of Hessians and several regiments of Scottish Highlanders. The mainbody of Hessians, 8,000 strong, landed on August 12. All in all, the Howebrothers now commanded a strike force of 42,000 soldiers, marines, and sailors,by far the largest military operation ever mounted in North America.31[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts31]Back in Philadelphia, Adams concluded that Lord Howe’s peace initiative hadalways been a delaying tactic: “He has let the cat out of the Bag…, throwing outhis Barrells to amuse Leviathan until his Reinforcements shall arrive.”32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts32] This was not really correct. LordRichard’s last-minute diplomatic effort was utterly sincere, though equallyhopeless. The more prosaic truth was that William Howe, fully aware that Germainhad spent a small fortune to acquire the Hessian mercenaries, saw no reason tolaunch his attack before they arrived. And given the tactical and manpoweradvantages that he enjoyed, he felt no pressure to move according to anyschedule but his own.For his part, Washington might be forgiven for regarding each new arrival ofBritish and Hessian troops as nails in the proverbial coffin. He wrote in anostalgic tone to a fellow veteran of earlier campaigns in the French and IndianWar, recalling their providential escapes at “the Meadows [Fort Necessity] andon the Banks of the Monongahela.” Since both of these battles had been crushingdefeats, they were strange memories to be conjuring up on the eve of the loomingbattle. Watching the British buildup enhanced his fear that the forces at hisdisposal were going to be seriously overmatched. He confessed that “I cannothelp but feeling very anxious Apprehensions.”33[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts33]Part of his problem was that he did not know for sure how many troops he had athis disposal. Under the implicit “balloon theory,” the size of the ContinentalArmy would be slightly more than doubled if and when militia units fromConnecticut, New York, and New Jersey arrived, bringing his total force to about25,000. But it was harvesttime, so many of the farmer-soldiers were late to thetask or did not show up at all. Washington dashed off last-minute exhortationsto state governors and militia officers to have the troops come on, leaving thecrops to rot in the field if necessary, emphasizing the historical urgency ofthe current crisis. “The Deficiency of Regiments … is far short of its intendedCompliments,” he warned. “Since the Settlement of these Colonies there has neverbeen such just occasion of Alarm or such an Appearance of an Enemy both by Seaand Land.”34 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts34]Moreover, he did not know how many of his troops already present were fit forduty. Contaminated water supplies had produced widespread dysentery onManhattan, and Greene reported an outbreak of smallpox on Long Island in lateJuly. Within the week, Washington estimated that 20 percent of his army was toosick to fight.Adams broke into a frenzy when he heard about the smallpox epidemic: “The smallPox has done us more harm than British Armies, Canadians, Indians, Negroes,Hannoverians, Hessians, and all the rest.” The disease was on his mind forpersonal reasons as well, since Abigail and their four young children werecurrently undergoing inoculation up in Boston at that very same time. He wasjuggling his responsibilities as statesman and his obligations as husband andfather, in the same letter expressing guilt about being distant while his familywas in danger, then adding that “our Army is also rather sickly at N. York.”35[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts35]The General Orders emanating from headquarters continued to sound an upbeatnote, despite the overwhelming British superiority in numbers. “The enemy willendeavor to intimidate by show and appearance, but remember how they have beenrepulsed on various occasions, by a few brave men,” read the order for August13. “Their Cause is bad; their men are conscious of it, and if opposed withfirmness, and coolness … Victory is most assuredly ours.”36[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts36]Washington did not really believe these words, though he did believe that he waspersonally and professionally obliged to write them. He was more candid withHancock, cataloging the manpower and sickness problems, acknowledging that itwas unlikely that he could prevent the Howes from capturing New York. But hefound final refuge in the Bunker Hill scenario, in effect another ruinousBritish victory: “These considerations lead me to think, that though the Appealmay not terminate so happily in our favor as I could wish, that they will notsucceed in their views without considerable loss. Any advantage they may get, Itrust will cost them dear.” Left unsaid was how many men he could afford to losein order to produce a Pyrrhic British victory.37[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts37]Not yet sure how his family had made it through the inoculation process, Adamsassured his recovering Abigail that his every thought was with her. But at leastone eye was looking north: “We are in daily expectation of some decisive strikeat New York.”38 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts38]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 5[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]AFTER VIRTUE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thus we are sowing the Seeds of Ignorance, Corruption, and Injustice, in thefairest Field of Liberty ever appeared upon Earth, even in the first attempts tocultivate it.—JOHN ADAMS TO JOSEPH HAWLEY, August 25, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Back in the spring, John Adams had on several occasions outlined the politicalsteps the Continental Congress should take in order to manage the movementtoward American independence responsibly. His primary concern had been to createa stable political platform of confederated states before launching the movementfor American independence.The central flaw in this wholly logical scheme—apart from the assumption that apolitical earthquake could be managed—was the belief that you could set thestage for an independent government before you knew for sure that there would bean independent America to govern. After the decisive vote of July 2 providedthat assurance, the delegates then decided to proceed without pause to addressthe ambitious political agenda that Adams had outlined earlier, albeit in adifferent order than he had envisioned.If only in retrospect, it was a preposterously presumptive decision, surely ameasure of the free-flowing confidence that accompanied the resounding triumphon the independence question. For the Continental Congress was proposing todraft a new constitution for the former United Colonies, now the United States,and at the same time to define the foreign policy goals of whatever governmentwas created, all this to be accomplished by two committees in a matter of weeksin late July and early August.The revolutionary fires were obviously burning brightly, warming up “the spiritof ’76” to a fever pitch that defied any prudent assessment of the possible. Infact, the political questions the Continental Congress proposed to resolve soquickly would continue to haunt and befuddle the infant American republic forthe next decade and beyond and would not reach resolution until theConstitutional Convention, and even then only tentatively.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts1]Moreover, these daunting political conversations would occur in the shadow ofthe looming British invasion at New York, which had been designed, and thenartfully organized, to deliver a crushing blow to the American rebellion beforeit got off the ground, thereby rendering all the deliberations in Philadelphiairrelevant. Given the escalating size of the two armies gathering on the watersand islands of New York, and given the “all-in” mentality of both sides, theapparent nonchalance of the Continental Congress is striking. While the Britishministry regarded the military outcome at New York as decisive, the delegates inPhiladelphia viewed the political agenda of an independent America as a prioritynot to be halted or hampered by worries about what would transpire on thebattlefields of Long Island and Manhattan.Part of the overconfidence was rooted in some combination of ignorance andmisguided faith in Washington’s ability to best Howe in New York, as he had donein Boston. Except perhaps for Adams, whose role as chair of the Board of War andOrdnance made him privy to more accurate intelligence, most delegates believedthat “swarming militia” had enhanced Washington’s army to nearly double the sizeof Howe’s. “Washington’s numbers are greatly increased, but we do not know themexactly,” Jefferson wrote a Virginia relative. “I imagine he must have from 30to 35,000 by this time.” In fact he had about half that number, of which 20percent were sick and “unfit for duty.” Jefferson noted in passing that Britishships had demonstrated their ability to navigate past American batteries on theHudson, but he did not realize the tactical implications of British navalsupremacy. “I imagine that General Washington, finding he cannot prevent theirgoing up the river,” he observed with confidence, “will prepare to amuse themwherever they shall go,” not recognizing that without a navy, Washington wastactically incapable of amusing anyone. Even after the full British force,absent the Hessians, had arrived on Staten Island, totaling 25,000 troops,Jefferson was reporting to Virginia correspondents that “the enemy there is notmore than 8 or 10,000 strong.”2 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts2]By and large, then, the view from Philadelphia was that Washington had thesituation well in hand in New York, which he clearly did not, and that theContinental Army had been sufficiently reinforced by militia to possesscomfortable numerical superiority over Howe’s army, when in fact the exactopposite was true. One wild rumor had Washington commanding a force of more than60,000.3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts3]Another optimistic train of thought circulating within the Continental Congresshad more far-reaching implications than any rough estimate of Washington’s andHowe’s armies. After returning from a tour of the eastern states, theMassachusetts delegate Elbridge Gerry reported to Adams that, by his reckoning,there were 111,000 militia armed and ready to fight from New Jersey northward,“a force sufficient to repulse the Enemy if he were 40,000 strong at New Yorkand Canada.” Even if Washington suffered a catastrophic defeat, even if hisentire army was destroyed or captured in New York, a virtually bottomless supplyof men was available to take their place. In response to British pretensions ofinvincibility based on the supremacy of their army and navy, an American senseof invincibility was now emerging, based on the manpower potential of theAmerican population.4 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts4]From the British perspective, a decisive victory in New York, then the union ofHowe’s and Burgoyne’s armies along the Hudson, would end the war. From theAmerican perspective, no single defeat would prove decisive until the entireAmerican population had been subjugated, an outcome no imaginable British armycould possibly achieve. As Franklin put it: “If the Enemy is beaten, it willprobably be decisive for them; for they can hardly produce another Armament foranother Campaign. But our growing Country can bear considerable Loses, andrecover them, so that a Defeat on our part will not by any means occasion ourgiving up the Cause.”5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts5]Franklin’s formulation reflected his values as a long-standing student ofAmerican demography, whose Observations on the Increase of Mankind (1751) hadpredicted—accurately, it turned out—that the American population was doublingevery twenty to twenty-five years, over twice as fast as the population of GreatBritain. In a century or so, Franklin observed with that ever-present twinkle inhis eye, the capital of the British Empire would probably have moved tosomewhere in Pennsylvania. But the more immediate implication of his demographicperspective—one could see overtones of this idea in Paine’s Common Sense aswell—was that the American and British armies were merely the militaryprojections of two different societies and populations. Whatever advantage theBritish enjoyed as a consequence of their superior army and navy was offset, andwould eventually be overcome, by the size and supremacy of America’s explodingpopulation. Whether they knew it or not, the Howe brothers were on a fool’serrand.But even within the optimistic framework of this emerging American perspective,the outcome at New York remained crucial. A humiliating British defeat would bevastly preferable, because it would mean a short war. A calamitous Americandefeat obviously would be painful, because it would mean a long war. Ahard-earned British victory along Bunker Hill lines—the most likely conclusion,in Washington’s opinion—would mean something in between. Whatever the result,the delegates in Philadelphia believed the American Revolution should continueto move forward politically regardless of the military outcome in New York. Forthem that meant deciding what a government of the United States should looklike, even while the armies squared off.IN LATE JULY and early August, the Continental Congress put itself intocommittee-of-the-whole posture in order to debate the recommendations of alarge, thirteen-man committee, chaired by John Dickinson, charged with providingthe framework for an American government that would replace the ContinentalCongress. For over a year, the congress had been functioning as a provisionalgovernment, with broad emergency powers that were implicitly justified by thedire circumstances of the ongoing if undeclared war and the looming prospects ofsecession from the British Empire. A more permanent central government wasobviously necessary once independence was declared, so on June 12 the congresshad appointed delegates from each of the colonies to a committee that wouldprovide the political architecture for that new government, if and whenindependence was declared. The committee met off and on for a month, thensubmitted what was called the Dickinson Draft on July 12. No record of thecommittee’s deliberations exists, because none was kept.6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts6]But some glimpse of the issues at stake is preserved in the correspondencebetween delegates at the time. Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire apprised acolleague that the conversations within the committee were edgy: “As it is avery important business, and some difficulties have arisen, I fear it will takesome time before it will be finally settled.” Edward Rutledge of South Carolinahinted at the core difficulty, objecting to “the idea of destroying allProvincial Distinctions and making every thing … bend to what they call the goodof the whole.” There was obviously a deep disagreement among delegates over howpowerful the new central government should be.7[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts7]The charge of the committee was to draw up “Articles of Confederation,”suggesting a voluntary alliance of sovereign states. The Continental Congresshad been created in 1774 as just such a confederation, and the constitutionalarguments made against Parliament’s authority had identified the colonialassemblies as the sanctioned voice of popular opinion, thereby locatingsovereignty in the respective colonial (soon state) governments.But over the past fifteen months, the Continental Congress had been functioningas a sovereign national government, adopting emergency powers to raise an army,orchestrate a collective response to British military and political policies,and put a common face on the thirteen separate colonies. This quasi-nationalstatus, to be sure, had been achieved pragmatically, on the run, in response tothe mounting British challenges currently embodied in all those ships andsoldiers commanded by the Howe brothers.Clearly, a faction within the committee wanted the new American confederation tobuild on the embryonic union created in the imperial crisis and establish acentral government sufficiently empowered to provide the political foundationfor an emerging nation rather than a mere clearinghouse for thirteen separatesovereignties that would presumably each go their own way after the war was won.The Dickinson Draft is difficult to interpret, even to comprehend, because itrepresents a series of accommodations between delegates with fundamentallydifferent visions of postrevolutionary America. The very term confederation, asmentioned, implied a loose alliance of sovereign states. But then Article 2referred to former colonies that “unite themselves into one Body politic.”Article 3 seemed to suggest that each state was sovereign over its own internalaffairs, reserving “to itself the sole and exclusive regulation and Governmentof its internal Police,” but then added the qualifying clause “in all Mattersthat shall not interfere with the Articles of Confederation.”8[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts8]The Dickinson Draft placed one unqualified restriction on the congress, namelythat it could never impose any taxes or duties on the states. The new congress,in short, could not become an American version of Parliament, a principle thatclearly reflected the core grievance of the colonies over the past decade. ButArticle 19 provided a long list of powers the congress could exercise, most ofthem related to foreign policy, and taken together they suggested a centralgovernment that was a good deal more than the passive plaything of the states.9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts9]No official record of the debate over the Dickinson Draft was kept, but bothAdams and Jefferson took notes that were preserved in their private papers.These provide a snapshot of the rivalries swirling among the different statesand regions. Such deep disagreements had been suppressed until now in order tosustain a united front against the British ministry and on behalf of a commoncommitment to that elevated ideal simply called “The Cause.” But if the coremeaning of “The Cause” was American independence, once all the former coloniesembraced that goal, the different interests of the new states rose to thesurface in a dramatic display of conflicting assumptions about the meaning of“the United States” after independence was won. The chorus quite quickly becamea cacophony.There were, in effect, three fundamental disagreements: first, a sectional splitbetween northern and southern states over slavery; second, a division betweenlarge and small states over representation; and third, an argument betweenproponents for a confederation of sovereign states and advocates for a moreconsolidated national union. All the political and constitutional questions thatwould bedevil the emerging American republic until the Civil War were thrownonto the agenda for the first time. For five days in late July and early August1776, the Continental Congress engaged in spirited debates that proved to be apreview of coming attractions in American history.Although slavery was too explosive an issue to be addressed directly, it wasalso too embedded in the economy of the southern states to avoid altogether. Theforbidden subject came up in the debate over Article 12 in the Dickinson Draft,which proposed that “the expenses for the war and the general welfare shall bedefrayed out of a Common Treasury, which shall be supplied by the severalcolonies in proportion to the Number of Inhabitants of every Age, Sex andQuality, except Indians.” An argument then ensued over how to count“Inhabitants,” which quickly became an argument over slaves: Were they personsor property?10 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts10]The southern delegates insisted that slaves were like horses and sheep andtherefore should not be counted as “Inhabitants.” Franklin countered that, thelast time he looked, slaves did not behave like sheep: “Sheep will never makeany insurrections.” This bit of humor was not appreciated by the South Carolinadelegation, which then proceeded to issue the ultimate threat: if slaves weredefined as persons rather than as property, “there is an End of theConfederation.” Sensing a southern secession movement, Samuel Chase of Marylandurged all delegates to calm down, then proposed that the term “white” beinserted before “inhabitants” in order to appease his southern brethren. ButChase’s proposed amendment only provoked outrage from northern delegates,including Adams, who accused South Carolina of trying to avoid its fair share ofthe tax burden to finance the war. In a thoroughly sectional vote, Chase’samendment was defeated.11 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts11]Since any resolution of the matter would risk a sectional split at the verymoment when a united front against Great Britain was utterly essential, thedelegates simply tabled it. It was resolved, if that is the correct term, in1783, when the Confederation Congress voted to count slaves as three-fifths of aperson for purposes of taxation and representation, an awkward compromise thatwas subsequently adopted at the Constitutional Convention.The question of representation in the new government generated an equallyspirited and divisive debate as the argument over slavery, though the split wasnot sectional but rather between large and small states. In the ContinentalCongress, each colony had one vote, no matter how large its population. AndArticle 18 of the Dickinson Draft recommended a continuation of theone-vote-per-state principle.12 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts12]But when the Dickinson Draft came before the full congress, delegates fromVirginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts launched a frontal assault onstate-based representation, arguing that population should determine theelectoral power of the respective delegations. Franklin was most outspoken onthe issue, warning that any new government based on equal representation bystate “will never last long,” because the disproportionate political power ofthe smaller states defied the economic realities. It was, Franklin argued, asimple matter of justice: “Let the smaller Colonies give equal Money and Men,and then have an equal Vote.”13 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts13]Advocates for proportional representation also wanted the new confederation tobuild on the intercolonial alliance against British imperialism forged duringthe past year. Benjamin Rush of Pennsylvania put it most provocatively: “We arenow a new Nation … We are dependent on each other—not totally independentstates.” As Rush described it, Americans were now united in common cause as asingle people. Only a representative government based on population couldreflect this new reality. Thinking as Virginians or Rhode Islanders was passé.The new name for the government, “the United States,” needed to become asingular rather than plural noun.14[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts14]Delegates from the smaller states found Rush’s national vision a politicalnightmare that exchanged the despotic power of Parliament for a domestic versionof the same leviathan. Roger Sherman of Connecticut warned that his constituentswould never surrender their liberties to some distant government that did notshare their values. Coming together to oppose the British invasion was onething, but Sherman described “the United States” as a plural noun, and anynational ethos was a pipe dream that defied state-based loyalties, which were asfar as most Americans were prepared to go. Though there was such a thing as “TheCause,” there was no such thing as “We, the people of the United States.”15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts15]Because voting in the Continental Congress remained state-based, Sherman and theother small-state delegates knew that they could carry the day despiteopposition by such powerful opponents as Franklin and Adams. And they did.The latent disagreements about the powers of the new central government rose tothe surface most menacingly in the debate about jurisdiction over theill-defined western borders of the states. Several states cited colonialcharters that placed their western borders at the Mississippi, or even morepreposterously in Virginia’s case, at the Pacific. A consensus in the congressheld that these extravagant claims were based on charters that had been draftedbefore anyone realized the size of the North American continent. But there wasno consensus on the question of whether the states or the new central governmentpossessed the authority to decide the matter. And the landed states likeVirginia and the landless states like Maryland were seriously split over how thematter should be resolved.16 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts16]Jefferson was under pressure from his colleagues back in Virginia to resist anyencroachment on the Old Dominion’s right to interpret her own charter claims.His main strategy was to defend Virginia’s jurisdiction but assure delegatesbehind the scenes that “no Virginian intended to go to the South Seas,” whichwas apparently a reference to the Pacific. Edward Pendleton, overseeing theVirginia Convention in Williamsburg, urged Jefferson to drag out the debate,then noted ominously that “perhaps while you are reading this, nay indeed whileI am writing it, it may be decided by the sword at New York whether we shallhave any land left to dispose of.”17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts17]In hindsight, the failure to achieve any consensus on the shape and powers ofthe new American government was eminently predictable. Knowing as we do thatenormous political and constitutional controversies over the overlappingquestions of sovereignty and slavery would define the history of the emergingAmerican republic for the next eighty-five years, we recognize that theconviction that these problems could be solved rather easily in a few weeks ofearnest effort during the summer of 1776 was unrealistic in the extreme. Lackingsuch hindsight, however, most delegates in the Continental Congress expresseddeep disappointment in their failure, coming as it did on the heels of thetriumphant vote on American independence.Adams was especially distraught to discover that unanimity about independenceshould be followed by total disagreement about what an independent Americangovernment might look like. “Thus we are sowing the Seeds of Ignorance,Corruption, and Injustice,” he lamented, “in the fairest Field of Liberty everappeared upon Earth, even in the first attempts to cultivate it.” Twoconclusions seemed to be clear: first, Americans were united, or at least mostlyunited, in opposition to the policies of the British ministry; second, they weredivided along regional and state lines once their common enemy was taken out ofthe equation. They knew what they were against, but did not know what they werefor.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts18]Adams had been extremely adroit at managing the delegates in the ContinentalCongress between advocates of reconciliation and proponents of independence in1775 and 1776. Now, however, the divisions within the congress had become morecomplicated and cut in several directions. Moreover, the political adrenalinethat had energized their collective response to British policy had run itscourse. Winning the war, of course, remained a common goal. Beyond that,however, the colonists had no agreed-upon political agenda, several competingversions of how an independent American republic should be configured, and someskepticism about whether any union of the states should continue after the warwas won. In his capacity as de facto secretary of war, Adams’s chief job was toprevent these emerging sectional and state divisions from undermining themilitary alliance. On the very eve of the battle in New York, he got a glimpseof just how difficult that job had become. Beyond independence, Americans had noconsensus on what being an American meant.The exposure of the deep differences that had lain latent beneath the surfacesince the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord fifteen monthsearlier moved the American Revolution into a new phase. The idealistic,quasi-religious political mentality suggested by elevated expressions like “TheCause,” and moralistic references to the superiority of American virtue ascontrasted with British corruption, had provided a rhetorical platform on whichthe different and disparate state and regional interests could congregate as aself-proclaimed collective. Like Joseph Warren at Bunker Hill, patriots wereprepared to sacrifice everything—in Jefferson’s lyrical rendering, “their lives,their fortunes, and their sacred honor”—on behalf of a higher goal.The exalted and almost operatic character of this mentality was heartfelt butunsustainable. It was like the honeymoon phase of a marriage, blissfullyromantic but of short duration. The divisive debates in midsummer 1776 markedthe end of virtue and the beginning of interest as the dominant influence inshaping debates in the Continental Congress. To be sure, the Howe brothers hadto be defeated and American independence won. But after that, nothing was clear.And everything would have to be negotiated.AMID THESE DISPIRITING political developments came one expected and unqualifiedsuccess. A committee charged with defining the contours of an American foreignpolicy, most urgently to explore a Franco-American alliance that would give thewartime government an invaluable European partner, delivered its report on July18. The committee had delegated the task to Adams, who single-handedly wrote thereport, which was titled “A Plan of Treaties.” Unlike the Dickinson Draft, whichwas an incoherent expression of differing opinions, the Plan of Treaties spokeclearly and with a singular voice. Almost inadvertently, it defined theframework for American foreign policy that remained in place for over acentury.19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts19]The first thirteen articles of the plan described the terms of a whollycommercial treaty “between the most Serene and mighty Prince, Lewis theSixteenth, the most Christian King, His Heirs and Successors, and the UnitedStates of America.” Adams adopted the courtly language of European diplomacy inits most affected style, presumably to demonstrate that the upstart Americangovernment knew how to play the European diplomatic game. In effect, France wasbeing invited to recognize the freshly created United States, and both countrieswould eliminate all import duties and tariffs in order to foster a more robustcommercial connection.20 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts20]The Plan of Treaties explicitly rejected any diplomatic or military alliancewith France. At least in retrospect, this seems strange, knowing as we do thatFrench military assistance was utterly essential in winning the war forindependence. But in July 1776 Adams and the other delegates in Philadelphia didnot believe that French troops and treasure would be necessary to defeat GreatBritain. Confidence in the prowess of the Continental Army and in a virtuallybottomless supply of manpower had yet to be exposed as wishful thinking.21[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts21]Articles 8 and 9 of the plan underlined the chief reason why any militaryalliance with France posed potential problems, for they prohibited any Frenchclaims to territory on the North American continent. A military alliance thatput French troops on American soil ran the risk that, once here, they wouldnever leave. Adams was fully aware of France’s desire to recover some portion ofits lost American empire, and he wanted to foreclose that possibility.22[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts22]Two years later, when the military situation on the ground looked moreproblematic, Adams was dispatched to Paris to negotiate the very diplomatic andmilitary alliance that the Plan of Treaties sought to avoid. (Franklin, in fact,had already negotiated the Franco-American alliance before Adams arrived.)Concern about French imperial ambitions on the North American continent,especially Canada, would not dissolve until the last French ship and soldiersailed home.The truly visionary contribution of the Plan of Treaties, to which theFranco-American alliance of 1778 was the unavoidable exception, was that thelodestar of American foreign policy for the foreseeable future would beneutrality. All treaties, most especially with any of the European powers, wouldbe exclusively commercial in character, with no binding diplomatic or militarycommitments. The Plan of Treaties was the first formulation of a neutral andisolationist posture subsequently enshrined in Washington’s Farewell Address(1796). This centerpiece of American foreign policy remained in place untilWorld War I and was not officially abandoned until after World War II.The debate over the Plan of Treaties went as smoothly as the debate over theDickinson Draft went badly. The Continental Congress adopted it on September 17with only a few minor revisions. Its passage created a rather anomaloussituation, namely that this new entity called the United States had a reasonablyclear vision of how it wished to interact within the world of nations, butlacked anything like a consensus on whether it was a nation itself.23[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts23]ANY HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION of the crowded political agenda of the ContinentalCongress in midsummer 1776 inevitably imposes an ex post facto sense ofcoherence that the delegates at the time, doing their best to manage events thatwere coming at them from multiple angles and at very high velocity, did notshare. They were trying to orchestrate a revolution, which almost by definitiongenerated a sense of collective trauma that defied any semblance of coherenceand control. If we wish to recover the psychological context of the majorplayers in Philadelphia, we need to abandon our hindsight omniscience andcapture their mentality as they negotiated the unknown.In Jefferson’s case, the editorial changes made in his draft of the Declarationpreoccupied him more than the debates over the Dickinson Draft and the directionof American foreign policy. He devoted considerable energy to making copies ofhis unedited version of the document, restoring the sections deleted by thecongress, placing their revisions in the margins so as to differentiate hislanguage from the published version circulating throughout the country. He thensent these copies to friends in Virginia, complaining that the congress haddiluted the purity of his message, suggesting that all the revisions weredefacements designed to appease the faint of heart, who still harbored hopes ofreconciliation with Great Britain. This was not really true—the revisions wereintended to clarify rather than compromise—but Jefferson’s wounded priderequired a more compelling rationale than thin skin.24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts24]His obsession with preserving his original language eventually waned, but itnever completely disappeared. Near the end of his life, he went back to thismoment in his autobiography and reiterated his sense of being badly treated bythe congress. At the time, he came off as a rather self-absorbed young man,though his early recognition that the language of the Declaration mattered agreat deal proved to be prescient.25[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts25]If his head was focused on defending his own words, his heart was at Monticello,where he himself desperately wanted to be. “I am sorry that the situation of mydomestic affairs renders it indispensably necessary that I should solicit thesubstitution of some other person here,” he explained to Edmund Pendleton backin Williamsburg, adding that “the delicacy of the house will not require me toenter minutely into the private causes which render this necessary.” These“private causes” surely referred to his wife’s health. Martha Jefferson waspregnant and, in fact, on the verge of suffering a miscarriage. “For God’s sake,for your country’s sake, and for my sake,” he wrote to Richard Henry Lee, “I amunder a sacred obligation to go home.” Ironically, if his plea to be replaced inthe Virginia delegation had been promptly answered, he would not have beenpresent to sign the Declaration on August 2, thereby tarnishing his lastingreputation as its author.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts26]If his correspondence is any indication, Jefferson was more interested in thedebates over the Virginia constitution occurring at Williamsburg than in thepolitical debates at Philadelphia. He had sent his own draft constitution toPendleton, who was chairing the Virginia Convention, and was especiallyconcerned that the right of suffrage be extended to “all who had a permanentintention of living in the country.” When rumors began to circulate inWilliamsburg that he harbored radical ideas about the inherent wisdom of “thepeople,” Jefferson was quick to point out that he opposed the direct election ofsenators in his draft constitution. “I have ever observed,” he wrote Pendleton,“that a choice by the people themselves is not generally distinguished for itswisdom. The first secretion from them is usually crude and heterogeneous.”27[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts27]Another libelous rumor suggesting that he had no stomach for tough-mindedpolitics against Indian tribes allied with the British produced a spiritedresponse that he would subsequently act on a quarter century later as president:“Nothing will reduce those wretches so soon as pushing the war into the heart oftheir country. But I would not stop there. I would never cease pursuing themwhile one of them remained on this side of the Mississippi.” He obviously caredmost about his reputation back home within the Tidewater elite and did not wishto be regarded as a romantic idealist.28[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts28]Finally, like all the delegates in the congress, Jefferson received regularupdates on the military situation in New York. The new information made him moreaware of the discrepancy in troop strength between the British and Americanarmies, but he remained confident that the last-minute arrival of militia wouldeven the odds. “Washington discovers a confidence, which he usually does only onhigh ground,” he reported to Pendleton. “He says his men are in high spirits.Those ordered to Long Island went with the eagerness of men going to a dance.”Military matters did not command the fullest attention of his formidableintellectual energies, and he accepted at face value the patriotic propagandaissuing from Washington’s headquarters.29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts29]ADAMS HAD A wholly different temperament and a range of responsibilities withinthe congress that did not allow him the luxury of indulging his personalfeelings. If Jefferson preferred to levitate above the waves of political andmilitary challenges roiling through the Continental Congress after independencewas declared, Adams was predisposed to dive into them all at once. In thedebates on the Dickinson Draft, he favored a more unified Americanconfederation. His leadership in drafting the Plan of Treaties, as we have seen,charted the future course for American foreign policy. On every political issue,he was both prepared and pugnacious, a one-man volcano ready to overwhelm hisopponents in a lava flow of words. His stature in the congress was equal toFranklin’s, who also had his enemies, and his responsibilities were second tonone. Working eighteen hours a day, he came across to his colleagues as theindefatigable and inexhaustible revolutionary spirit, running a marathon at thepace of a sprinter.Most demanding were his duties as chair of the Board of War and Ordnance, forthey made him the pivotal connection between the Continental Congress and theContinental Army. He was burdened with a cascade of specific requests.Washington needed thirty thousand flints for muskets, then an additional fivetons of gunpowder; promotion decisions for senior officers created bruised egosthat he had to soothe; militia units from Massachusetts originally ordered tothe northern front on Lake Champlain had to be diverted to bolster Washington’sarmy in New York.30 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts30]Beyond managing these pressing if nettlesome details, Adams was literally forcedby his position as the civilian most responsible for military affairs to engagewith the larger strategic issues. Both Joseph Reed and Nathanael Greene wrotehim to warn that confidence that the militia would bolster the fighting strengthof the Continental Army was misplaced, arguing that the militia were untestedamateurs whose numbers did not translate on equal terms with British or Hessianprofessionals on the battlefield. Reed and Greene urged larger bounties torecruit more soldiers with longer enlistments into the Continental Army.31[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts31]Adams agreed with their assessment but apprised them that political opinion inthe congress was resolutely opposed to the creation of a large standing army. “Iam convince that Time alone, will persuade Us to this measure,” he explained.“And in the mean Time We shall be forced to depend upon temporary calls uponMilitia.” More than anyone else in the congress, Adams recognized that thecurrent model of a relatively small Continental Army, supplemented at eachengagement with a surge of militia from surrounding states, was risky. Just howrisky was about to be discovered on Long Island and Manhattan.32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts32]But he could not afford to focus exclusively on the looming battle in New York.For example, a congressional hearing on the failed campaigns against Quebecbecame a search for scapegoats. Adams concluded that the debacle at Quebec wasthe result of several uncontrollable factors, chiefly bad weather and a virulentsmallpox epidemic. More significantly, he came to regard the entire Canadiancampaign as delusional, a misguided use of America’s limited military resourcesbased on the presumption that Canada was somehow destined to become part of theUnited States.33 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts33]He ordered General Horatio Gates, recently appointed commander of what was beingcalled the Northern Army, to abandon the Canadian campaign and consolidate hisposition farther south on Lake Champlain. “We are very anxious, for you and yourArmy,” he wrote Gates, “as well as for the General [Washington] and his at NewYork.” Then he added a highly revealing insight: “We expect some bold Strokesfrom the Enemy, but I don’t believe that Howe and Burgoyne will unite theirforces this year.”34 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts34]Adams clearly grasped the central goal of British strategy, which was to isolateNew England by capturing the Hudson corridor in a two-pronged campaign, withHowe’s larger force coming up from New York and General John Burgoyne’s 7,000troops coming down through Lake Champlain. While Washington contested Howe’scapture of New York, Adams wanted Gates to forget Canada and focus on stoppingBurgoyne’s march down the Hudson Valley. More than any other delegate inPhiladelphia, he had a panoramic perspective of the entire American theater.No one was juggling more political and military responsibilities than Adams. Noone else recognized the all-or-nothing character of this decisive moment orraised his pulse to match the impossible demands of that moment. He was therevolutionary spirit incarnate, and despite a lengthy career of considerableachievement, this was his finest hour.But, like Jefferson, Adams found his overcrowded mind diverted by personaldistractions about his family. As we have seen, in mid-July he had learned thathis wife, Abigail, and their four young children were undergoing inoculation forsmallpox in Boston. Abigail’s descriptions of their eleven-year-old daughter,Nabby, nearly brought him to tears. “She has about a thousand pustules as largea great Green Pea,” and could neither stand nor sit without pain. Then wordarrived that Charles, the younger son, had caught the smallpox “in the naturalway,” meaning by contagion rather than inoculation, and was “in delirium for 48hours,” on the edge of death.35 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts35]Adams felt that he was failing in his role as a husband and father in order tofulfill his role as an American statesman and patriot. “It is not possible forme to describe … my Feelings on this occasion,” he wrote Abigail. “I shall feellike a Savage to be here, while my whole Family is sick at Boston.” But despitethe temptations to head for home, he was like a soldier who could not leave hispost. “My Sweet Babe Charles, is never out of my Thoughts—Gracious Heavenpreserve him,” he wrote to Abigail, but then concluded that “the two Armies arevery near each other, at Long Island.”36[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts36]IF JEFFERSON WAS disposed to levitate above the political struggles withincongress, and if Adams preferred to embed himself in them all at once, Franklinbrought his own distinctive mix of floating engagement to the task. In anymeeting he was always the most famous man in the room—an internationallyacclaimed scientist, a renowned essayist and wit, the senior statesman parexcellence. “I am glad to find that notwithstanding your Countrymen have had somany good slices of you those forty years past,” James Bowdoin wrote Franklinwith a wink, “there’s enough of you to afford them good Picking Still.… Theystill expect to feast upon you, and to feast as usual most deliciously.”37[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts37]Though he was a latecomer to the cause of independence who had worked tirelesslyin London to effect a reconciliation, his conversion was as complete as it wassudden. He was convinced that the decision by George III and the Britishministry to, in effect, declare war on the American colonies would go down asthe biggest blunder in the history of British statecraft, and he had apprisedRichard Howe of that conviction. It was a measure of Franklin’s prestige thatLord Richard, instead of feeling insulted, attempted to sustain the friendship.He hoped that “the dishonour to which you deem me exposed by my militarysituation in this country has effected no change in your sentiments of personalregard towards me; so shall no difference in political points alter my desire ofproving how much I am your sincere and obedient humble servant.” Franklin wroteback to reiterate his view that Howe’s hopes for a reconciliation with Americaand with him were illusions. But he chose not to send the letter. He conveyedthe impression of a prophet who knew which way history was headed. And if youwere on the wrong side, as Howe clearly was, no sentimental attachment couldbridge the gap between the two political camps.38[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts38]Franklin applied the same rigorous standard to his own son, William, anillegitimate child whom he had raised as a full-fledged member of his family.William Franklin had been appointed the royal governor of New Jersey, then sidedwith Great Britain when the Anglo-American argument widened into a war. He wasarrested as a dangerous Tory in the spring of 1776 and was eventually sent toConnecticut for safekeeping. William’s wife, Elizabeth, wrote to Franklin,begging him to intercede and have William paroled to New Jersey so they could betogether. “Consider my Dear and Honored Sir,” she wrote, “that I am now pleadingthe Cause of your Son, and my beloved Husband.” Franklin did not respond. Hisson had chosen sides and would have to live with the consequences. At thisfateful moment, political commitments were thicker than blood.39[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts39]On the more controversial issues about the future American government raised bythe Dickinson Draft, Franklin was a staunch advocate for proportionalrepresentation and therefore a neonationalist who thought that an independentAmerica should become more than a confederation of sovereign states. But he wasnot willing to insist on the proportionality principle in the face of unitedopposition from the smaller states. Just as he thought that history was on theAmerican side in the war for independence, he thought that time would prove astate-based confederation inadequate to the task of governance. If thatpolitical fruit had to ripen before it could be picked, so be it. If you knewhow the journey was going to end, you could afford to be patient along thepath.40 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts40]The same combination of prescience and patience shaped his response to thedrafting of the Pennsylvania constitution. Like Jefferson, he took a personalinterest in the framing of his own state’s constitution. But unlike Jefferson,Franklin enjoyed the advantage of proximity—the Pennsylvania Convention wasmeeting in Philadelphia, indeed in the same building as the ContinentalCongress.In meetings with Pennsylvania delegates on August 13 and 15, he lent hisconsiderable weight to two of the most distinctive and conspicuously democraticprovisions of the Pennsylvania constitution, namely the insistence on a bill ofrights and the creation of a one-house legislature to be elected by a citizenrythat included artisans as well as property owners, thereby giving Pennsylvaniathe most egalitarian government in the United States. But he let others take thelead in the debates and receive the credit when the final draft was ratified.His suggested revisions were almost entirely stylistic. Given his prestige, hismost important contribution was being present to lend legitimacy to theenterprise. In both the Pennsylvania Convention and the Continental Congress,Franklin was an invaluable trophy, more revered and renowned at this stage thanWashington; he was the Delphic Oracle of the American Revolution.41[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts41]It was a role that Franklin took to instinctively, since he was a genius atsensing what the political imperatives of the moment required. In this instance,they required a sagacious pose, embodying the conviction that the cause ofAmerican independence had providential winds at its back. They also required himto become involved in the political debates at a higher altitude that preservedand protected his special status by not being drawn into damaging arguments.This made him an intriguing combination of Adams’s omnipresence and Jefferson’sdistancing. He was a singular figure.But even Franklin, who believed the British course was doomed, recognized thatthe military outcome in New York would determine whether the eventual Americanvictory would occur quickly—obviously the preferred conclusion—or slowly, in amore drawn-out war that Great Britain would eventually abandon. He lacked thefull flow of information that Adams enjoyed about troop strength and the doubtsabout the fighting prowess of the militia, but one informant serving in thebatteries along the Hudson assured him that the British invasion would berepulsed: “Every circumstance here is cheerful and if our Enemies dare attack,they will undoubtedly procure themselves a severe drubbing.” Franklin did notbelieve that a defeat in New York would kill the American cause, but neither didhe believe that patriotic estimates of the odds were reliable. He was confidentthat America would win the war but uncertain that the Continental Army would winthe battle for New York. “While I am writing,” he told Horatio Gates on August28, “comes an account that the armies were engaged on Long Island, the eventunknown, which throws us into anxious suspense. God grant success.” As it turnedout, God was not listening.42 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts42]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 6[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]THE FOG OF WAR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In general, our Generals were out generalled.—JOHN ADAMS TO ABIGAIL ADAMS, October 8, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ever since Lord Richard Howe’s fleet had landed on Staten Island in early July,Washington had been expecting an attack. But over the ensuing weeks, asadditional waves of troops and ships arrived, it became apparent that LordGermain and the British ministry intended to assemble a strike force much largerthan Washington expected. And the Howe brothers saw no reason to launch aninvasion until all of Germain’s reinforcements, most especially the highlyprofessional (and very expensive) Hessians, showed up in mid-August.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts1]The delay meant that the military campaign would begin late in the season,leaving the Howes only about three or four months to capture New York andvanquish the Continental Army before going into winter quarters. It also meantthat the size of the American force opposing the invasion would growconsiderably, because militia units from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware,and Maryland would flow into New York in early August, latecomers who hadharvested their crops before shouldering their muskets.Though mystified by the delaying tactics of the Howes, Washington welcomed theopportunity to even the odds: “They [the British troops] have been stronger thanthe Army under my Command, which will now, I expect, gain greater strength thantheirs, as the Militia are beginning to come fast, and have already augmentedour numbers … to about 23,000 men.” A week later, on the eve of the battle, theytotaled about 28,000.2 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts2]The militia surge bolstered the confidence of several American officers,including even Greene, despite his skepticism about the fighting prowess ofmilitia. Writing from the front lines on Long Island, Greene assured Washingtonthat all was under control: “I have the Pleasure to inform you that the Troopsappear to be in exceedingly good Spirits, and have no doubt that if they shouldmake their attack here we shall be able to render a very good account of them.”Lord Stirling, who was supervising the defensive preparations on Long Island,concurred with Greene. The forts, redoubts, and trenches were so formidable thatStirling actually hoped, as he put it, “that General Howe would come here inpreference to any other spot in America.” Eight months earlier Charles Lee hadrendered the judgment that New York was indefensible. Now Stirling thought itimpregnable.3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts3]Stirling’s excessive enthusiasm often made it difficult to distinguish betweenbravado and confidence. But subsequent testimony from British and Hessianofficers confirmed that the layered defensive scheme on Long Island wassufficient to repel a frontal assault by 50,000 troops. And even Germain had notseen fit to gather a British force that large.Given the capacity for carnage building up on both sides, the final exchange ofletters between William Howe and Washington seemed to suggest that Howe deeplyregretted the whole bloody business. “I cannot close this letter,” he confidedto Washington, “without expressing the deepest Concern that the unhappy state ofthe colonies, so different from what I had the Honor of experiencing in theCourse of the last war, deprives me of the Pleasure I should otherwise have hadin a more personal Communication.”4[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts4]Washington recognized this as a nostalgic postscript to the failed effort atreconciliation a month earlier. But he felt obliged to respond in the samearistocratic style, maintaining the etiquette of honor between two gentlemen whowished to disassociate themselves from the looming slaughter they were about tooversee. “Give me leave to assure you, sir,” Washington replied, “that I feelmyself greatly obliged by the polite conclusion of your letter … and have a highsense of the honor and satisfaction I should have received from your personalacquaintance. The different state of the colonies from what it was in the lastWar & which has deprived me of that Happiness, cannot be regretted by any onemore than Sir Your Most Obedt Servt.” The courtesies having been properlyexchanged, the bloody work could now begin.5[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts5]ANTICIPATING JUST WHERE that work would occur was Washington’s primary dilemma.On August 14, two British deserters reported that the main British attack wasaimed at Long Island. Another intelligence report a few days later predictedcoordinated attacks on Long Island and the northern tip of Manhattan. Althoughone of the cardinal principles of military tactics was never to divide your armyin the face of a superior force, Washington was forced to violate it because hewas defending two islands against an opponent with total naval supremacy. Hechose to regard any British attack against Long Island as a likely diversion;placed 6,000 troops, only a third of his men “fit for duty,” there; and kept theremainder on Manhattan, which after all was the ultimate British objective.6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts6]Meanwhile, over on Staten Island, a lively debate was occurring between Howe andHenry Clinton, his second-in-command, over their strategic options. In truth,Howe had little respect for Clinton either as a general or as a man, so therewas never a serious chance that Clinton’s preference would prevail. They hadserved together at Bunker Hill and in the Boston Siege, where Clinton haddisplayed his lifelong tendency to make enemies of all his superiors, who neverseemed to appreciate his advice as much as he thought it deserved. Clinton, itseems, possessed a truly unique talent for making himself obnoxious; he was thekind of insufferable character who always knew he was right. In this instance,however, all the advantages of hindsight make it abundantly clear that, in fact,he was.7 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts7]Clinton favored a British invasion at King’s Bridge, at the northern end ofManhattan, where the Harlem River separates the island from the mainland. Ifsuccessful, this option would block the escape of the Continental Army on bothManhattan and Long Island, presuming British naval control of the Hudson andEast rivers. Once trapped, the Continental Army could be gradually eroded andeventually annihilated in a single campaign. Clinton’s strategy was based on theassumption that the proper target was not the city and port of New York but theContinental Army itself. If it ceased to exist, the American rebellion wouldfollow suit.8 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts8]Howe disagreed. He believed that the Continental Army had to be decisivelydefeated but not destroyed. His orders from Germain were to capture New York,which would then become the base of operations for the British army and navy forthe decisive campaign to close the Hudson corridor and isolate New England. Ifthe city and port of New York were the target, then Long Island was the obviousavenue to reach it, since command of Brooklyn Heights would render southernManhattan indefensible. If the Continental Army was sufficiently humiliated inthe process to break the will of the rebellion, so much the better. But thestrategic goal was the occupation of New York, not the annihilation of theContinental Army. Howe had the final say, of course, so the invasion on LongIsland was scheduled for August 22, by which time the recently arrived Hessiansshould be ready to go.9 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts9]In hindsight, Howe’s decision to reject Clinton’s preferred strategy may havemeant that Great Britain lost a golden opportunity to end the American rebellionat its very inception. We can never be sure about this might-have-been, becausewe cannot know whether the total destruction or capture of the Continental Armywould have broken the will of the rebellion. Perhaps, as both Adams and Franklinsincerely believed, the Continental Congress would have defiantly raised anotherarmy and appointed another version of Washington to lead it. What is clear isthat both armies would have been better served if their respective commandershad exchanged places. For Howe, in targeting the territory rather than theContinental Army, pursued the cautious strategy when he should have been bold.And Washington, in his very decision to defend New York, pursued the boldstrategy when he should have been cautious.AN IMPROBABLE PIECE of bad luck then struck at the worst possible time, whenGreene informed Washington that he was “confined to my Bed with a raging fever”on August 15. Washington’s ablest and most trusted officer, just appointed amajor general, Greene had also designed and built the defensive network on LongIsland and made himself thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Now he had to beevacuated to Manhattan. To replace Greene, Washington chose John Sullivan, notbecause he knew and trusted him but because he was the only senior officerwithout a command, having just come down from Albany after threatening to resignrather than serve under Horatio Gates. Sullivan was a former New Hampshirelawyer of boundless confidence, limited military experience, and total ignoranceof the troops he was to command and the ground he was to defend.10[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts10]The British Army had been practicing amphibious operations on Staten Island fortwo weeks. On August 22, more than 300 transport vessels carried 15,000 troopsinto Gravesend Bay in southwestern Long Island without a hitch and without anyappreciable resistance. Lord Howe’s secretary, Ambrose Serle, described thescene as breathtaking: “In a Word, the Disembarkation of about 15,000 Troopsupon a fine Beach, their forming upon the adjacent Plain … exhibited one of thefinest & most picturesque Scenes that the Imagination can fancy or the Eyebehold.” Three days later another 5,000 Hessians were ferried across. AlthoughWashington moved another 2,000 men over the East River to reinforce the LongIsland garrison, the Americans were outnumbered more than two to one. Washingtonwas still hedging his bets that the invasion of Long Island was a feint and themain British attack would come on Manhattan.11[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts11]In his General Orders the next day, Washington announced that the long-awaitedtesting time for the Continental Army had finally arrived: “The Enemy has nowlanded on Long Island, and the hour is fast approaching, on which the Honor andSuccess of this army, and the safety of our bleeding Country depend. Rememberofficers and Soldiers, that you are Freemen, fighting for the blessings ofLiberty—that slavery will be your portion, and that of your posterity, if you donot acquit yourselves like men.” In case these inspiring words provedinsufficient, all the troops should also know that “if any man attempt to skulk,lay down, or retreat without orders, he will instantly be shot down as anexample.”12 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts12]GREENE HAD DEVISED a three-tiered defensive scheme for Long Island designed toinflict an unsustainable level of casualties on the British as they movedthrough each killing zone. Sharpshooters would be positioned in the thicklywooded area north of Gravesend Bay, concentrated along the three passes thatafforded space for British horses and artillery to advance. The American troopswould then fall back to a necklace of trenches and redoubts on Gowanus Heights,a ridgeline running east to west across Long Island. Greene’s original planenvisioned a stiff but temporary stand on Gowanus Heights, then a retreat to themain defensive perimeter, which consisted of four forts on Brooklyn Heights,where he presumed the heaviest fighting would occur. It was a collapsiblenetwork of defensive positions that took maximum advantage of the terrain andallowed the American troops to fight behind cover rather than engage the Britishon open ground, where the superior discipline and experience of British soldierswould be likely to prevail.13 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts13]Sullivan’s first, and last, act as a commander was to revise Greene’s plan byenlarging the garrison on Gowanus Heights to 3,000 men, nearly half his force.As events were to demonstrate, this was a costly mistake, making Gowanus Heightsthe focus of the battle, where the American force would be outnumbered seven toone.Then, on August 24, Washington had second thoughts about Sullivan and appointedIsrael Putnam as overall commander on Long Island, with Sullivan restricted tocommand of the troops on Gowanus Heights. “Old Put” had the torso of a bull, thehead of a cannonball, and the mentality of a natural warrior. A veteran ofBunker Hill and a legendary Indian fighter in the French and Indian War—he hadonce escaped while being roasted by Indians over a fire—Putnam had requested thecommand once it became clearer that the main British attack would come on LongIsland. “The brave old man was quite miserable at being kept here,” Joseph Reedwrote from the headquarters on Manhattan. While Washington’s change of mindconveyed a certain indecisiveness, putting his most battle-tested leader incharge also reflected his recognition, at last, that Long Island was the Britishobjective. Despite that recognition, he kept over half his troops on Manhattan,thereby covering his bases, but at the cost of ensuring that the British wouldenjoy a vastly superior force at the point of attack.14[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts14]William Howe was reputed to be the finest student of light infantry tactics inthe British Army. And his experience at Bunker Hill meant that he was perhapsthe last British officer in America to mount a frontal assault against Greene’sformidable network of defenses. But the more he studied the maps, the moreGreene’s defensive scheme seemed to defy evasion, making a battle with highBritish casualties unavoidable.Then Henry Clinton came up with a bold, if stunningly simple, solution. He hadalso been studying the maps. Far to the east, about seven miles from the centerof the American defenses, was a little-used road called Jamaica Pass. Localloyalists reported that the Americans regarded it as too far away to justifyanything more than a token force of defenders. But it was, Clinton claimed, thekey to the battle for Long Island, because it would allow Howe to outflankGreene’s layered entrenchments.Clinton proposed a flanking maneuver up Jamaica Pass that would place Britishtroops behind the American lines on Gowanus Heights, cutting off their retreatto the forts on Brooklyn Heights. He also proposed that British and Hessianunits engage the right and center of the American defensive front in order tocompel their attention until they found themselves surrounded. It was abrilliant plan, the obvious answer to Howe’s tactical dilemma, but it wasburdened by the awkward liability of coming from the obnoxious Clinton.15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts15]Clinton later acknowledged that he was his own worst enemy during tacticaldebates with Howe. “My zeal may perhaps on these occasions,” he recalled, “havecarried me so far as to at times be thought troublesome.” In this case, however,Clinton had the good sense to delegate the presentation of his plan to asubordinate. On August 26, Howe embraced it, invoking the commander’sprerogative to claim it as his own.16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts16]A group of loyalists then volunteered to guide British troops up Jamaica Pass ina night march. It was telling that no Long Island residents exposed the Britishplan to anyone in the Continental Army. This was perhaps the one place inAmerica that was so predominantly loyalist in sentiment that the British enjoyeda significant advantage in intelligence, a rare occasion that Howe exploitedfully.AT NIGHTFALL ON August 26, Clinton led the vanguard of 10,000 British andHessian troops on a looping seven-mile march around the left flank of theAmerican defenses, Howe and Cornwallis trailing with the main body. How Sullivancould have neglected to defend Jamaica Pass invited criticism at the time andspeculation ever since. He was aware that the pass existed, since he dispatchedfive horsemen to guard it, all of whom were quickly and easily captured. How aBritish force so large, hacking and sawing its way through underbrush, couldmove undetected has also seemed strange. In fact, two American officers, SamuelMiles and David Brodhead, later testified that they did spot the British column.“I was convinced … that General Howe would fall into the Jamaica road,” Milesrecalled, “and I hoped there were troops there to watch them.” But there werenot. Sullivan subsequently attempted to excuse his blunder by claiming, ratherlamely, “I had no foot [i.e., soldiers] for the purpose.”17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts17]Meanwhile, up on Gowanus Heights, Clinton’s plan was working perfectly. Aformidable British force of 5,000 infantry and 2,000 marines commanded byGeneral James Grant engaged Stirling’s brigade on the right flank. Sullivanapprised Putnam that the main British attack had begun, and Putnam in turn urgedWashington to cross the river and join him on Brooklyn Heights to oversee thebattle. In truth, Grant’s attack was only a diversion, designed to engage theAmerican troops while the force under Clinton and Howe came around from therear.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts18]Grant nevertheless used the occasion to bombard Stirling’s men from a distancefor two hours. “Both the balls and shells flew very fast,” one soldier reported,“now and then taking off a head.” Stirling had ordered his men to stand information rather than take cover, a way of exhibiting military discipline andembracing the code of honor still alive and well in the eighteenth century. “Ourmen stood it amazingly well,” one soldier proudly declared, “not even one showeda disposition to shrink.” A Hessian force under General Leopold von Heister,another 4,000 troops, gathered to the right of Grant’s men as together theybraced themselves to become the anvil to the Clinton-Howe hammer, theContinental Army in between.19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts19]The hammer came down at nine o’clock on the morning of August 27, when 10,000British soldiers emerged behind the American lines, producing panic among newrecruits, who were simultaneously surrounded and outnumbered. In most units,discipline dissolved immediately as soldiers attempted to flee to the forts onBrooklyn Heights. Joseph Plumb Martin, then only fifteen years old, rememberedthat a young American lieutenant broke down, sobbing uncontrollably, beggingforgiveness from his men as they ran past him to the rear. He also rememberedofficers removing the cockades from their hats so they could not be recognizedas officers if captured. He witnessed a massacre at Gowanus Creek as retreatingAmerican soldiers either drowned or were gunned down by British infantry fromthe bank, the dead bodies floating over the entire surface of the water.20[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts20]In certain pockets of action, captured American troops were summarily executed.“The Hessians and our brave Highlanders gave no quarter,” recalled one Britishofficer. “And it was a fine sight to see with what alacrity they dispatched therebels with their bayonets, after we had surrounded them so they could notresist.” Other witnesses described Hessians pinning American prisoners to treeswith their bayonets. Such atrocities were the exception rather than the rule,but they later became standard features in American newspaper accounts of thebattle that depicted the Hessians as barbaric mercenaries.21[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts21][images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_001_r1.jpg]While the dominant response of the American troops was fear and flight, in somesectors of the battlefield they fought with a ferocity that even the Britishacknowledged as impressive. This was especially true on the right flank, whereStirling commanded veteran regiments from Maryland and Delaware. Stirlinghimself was an unlikely combat leader, described by his biographer as “anoverweight, rheumatic, vain, pompous, gluttonous inebriate.” But in this intensetime of testing, he was magnificent, several observers agreeing that he “foughtlike a wolf.” In order to buy time for his other troops to escape, Stirling ledhis Marylanders on seven suicidal attacks against British regulars—400 against2,000—suffering a 90 percent casualty rate in the process of inflicting heavylosses on the British. Observing the action from Brooklyn Heights through hisspyglass, Washington was heard to remark, “Good God! What brave fellows I mustthis day lose.”22 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts22]It was all over before noon. Both armies reported inflated casualty rates forthe other side, Howe rather preposterously claiming more killed, wounded, orcaptured Americans than were engaged in the fighting on Gowanus Heights. Thebest estimate is that both sides suffered between 300 and 400 dead and wounded,the Americans more dead than wounded because of the Hessian massacres. But thebest measure of the British victory was the number of Americans captured, nearly1,000, most of whom were fated to die miserable deaths from disease andmalnutrition on British prison ships in New York harbor supervised by BetsyLoring’s husband. Two American generals, Stirling and Sullivan, were among theprisoners.23 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts23]Ironically, because so many inexperienced American troops fled so precipitously,simply ignoring the efforts of their officers to stand and fight, about 2,000made it back to the forts to fight another day. Veteran British troops wouldhave obeyed their officers and ended up casualties or prisoners.Beyond the sheer calculus of casualties and captured, however, the will of theContinental Army had been broken and any semblance of military disciplinedestroyed. The psychological momentum on the battlefield had swung entirely inthe British direction, so much so that British and Hessian troops had to berestrained from pursuing the fleeing Continentals into the forts on BrooklynHeights.Several witnesses, including Howe himself, believed that the forts and theentire American army on Long Island would have been taken if the British attackhad continued. “Had they been permitted to go on,” he later acknowledged, “it ismy opinion that they would have carried the redoubts.” Looking down fromBrooklyn Heights, Putnam observed that “General Howe is either our friend or nogeneral.” In Putnam’s judgment, Howe “had our whole army in his power.… Had heinstantly followed up his victory the consequences to the cause of liberty musthave been dreadful.” And Clinton, true to form, believed that Howe had missedthe chance to end the war in a single stroke. “Complete success would mostlikely have been the consequence of an immediate attack,” he recorded in hismemoirs, “for there is no saying to what extent the effect resulting from theentire loss of the army might have been … or where it would have stopped.”Clinton held to his conviction that the destruction of the Continental Armywould have generated traumatic shock waves that in turn would have destroyed thewill of the American people to continue the war.24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts24]William Howe thought differently, though his thought process at this stage hadbecome as layered as the American defenses on Long Island, and any attempt to doit justice requires the kind of analytical skills customarily associated withpsychoanalysis.As we know, Howe had once entertained serious hopes of negotiating a peacefulend to the rebellion, which he tended to regard as an unfortunatemisunderstanding that had somehow escalated to the current bloodletting becauseof radical leaders in Philadelphia and ill-informed officials in London andWhitehall. His fondest dream, shared by his brother, was to go home not as aconquering hero but as a statesman who had successfully brokered a peacefulreconciliation with his former American brethren.This dream was dashed in July, when his brother’s entreaties were dismissed aswholly inadequate by both Washington and the Continental Congress. Havingcrossed the line toward independence just before the Howes arrived, the rebelswere not disposed to retrace their steps. By August, then, Howe had becomeconvinced that only a decisive military defeat could bring the Americans totheir senses by exposing the utter futility of their fight against a vastlysuperior British army and navy. And he was fully prepared to deliver that defeaton Long Island, which is what by late August he was in the process of doing.25[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts25]Nevertheless, the dashed dream of a negotiated settlement never died. Howe hadonly put it aside to administer a proper thrashing to Washington’s amateur army,after which the rebels would be more disposed to recognize the hopelessness oftheir cause. And for this reason, he conducted the war on the assumption that acareful and calibrated demonstration of British military supremacy wassufficient for the task at hand. Unlike Clinton, who believed that the war mustbe won quickly with a massive blow that destroyed the Continental Army so thatit did not evolve into a protracted conflict of dubious conclusion, Howe thoughtBritish victory was inevitable, which in turn meant that a more limited strategywas wholly adequate. Unlike the British campaigns against the Irish and theScots, which were savage, genocidal conflicts that left residues of resentmentfor centuries, Howe wanted his American campaign to be a more measured affair,permitting a postwar resumption of the prewar mutual affection that heremembered so well.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts26]Howe’s preference for a strategy of limited war had a British component as well.He was obsessed with keeping his own casualties low, which was the considerationhe subsequently cited in defense of his decision to halt the attack on BrooklynHeights. “I would not risk the loss,” he explained, “that might have beensustained in the assault.” Bunker Hill still haunted him, to be sure, but so dida keen sense that he was managing resources that were expensive, finite, and noteasily replaced.27 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts27]The American and British sides of the Howe equation, then, were perfectlybalanced. On both sides, he preferred to keep damage to a minimum. In the caseof those forts on Brooklyn Heights, that meant conducting a siege while theBritish navy bombarded them from offshore. In a matter of days, Washington wouldhave no choice but to surrender, a delay of small consequence when compared tothe losses on both sides that would be entailed with an immediate frontalattack. After all, if you were sure of the outcome, there was no need to hurry,a posture that also suited Howe’s laid-back style.Washington was too beleaguered to affect anything like a style. For two days, hewore himself out riding up and down the line on Brooklyn Heights, exhorting thedispirited troops. Exhausted, still dazed by the ruinous defeat, the man whowould one day earn a well-deserved reputation for decisiveness did not know whatto do. And as he stared into the abyss, a heavy rain filled the trenches so thatsentries were standing waist-deep in water, many of their muskets uselessbecause their powder was wet. Meanwhile, Howe’s engineers were digging their owntrenches, angling up toward the forts in zigzag formations that afforded coverin a classic siege tactic. It was now clear that Washington’s decision to orderanother 1,200 troops over from Manhattan, enlarging the garrison on BrooklynHeights to 9,500, had been a mistake, since it only put more American troops inthe British trap. Given the forces arrayed against him, Washington had onlythree options: surrender, face annihilation, or attempt an escape across theEast River to Manhattan.28 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts28]Joseph Reed had been pressing Washington to make the only plausible choice, butfor several reasons he could not bring himself to order a retreat. He had, afterall, been lecturing his men to stand fast against the British attack for months.How could he reverse himself now without appearing foolish?29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts29] More elementally, Washington wasan honor-driven man in the eighteenth-century mode. He understood completely whyStirling had ordered his men to stand at attention while British artilleryrounds and grapeshot (i.e., chain links and iron pellets) were lopping off headsand disemboweling his troops. Though it sounds irrational to our modernmentality, Washington believed that his personal honor, meaning the core of hischaracter as an officer and a gentlemen, obliged him to suffer death rather thanthe dishonor of retreat. His apparent paralysis was the result of balancing twoimperatives: his reputation against the survival of the Continental Army.30[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts30]The resolution of his dilemma came on August 29 in the form of General ThomasMifflin, who had done a reconnaissance of the American perimeter and reportedthat troop morale was low, with several units actually talking aboutsurrendering to the British. Mifflin was a wealthy Philadelphia merchant ofQuaker background who had rejected his pacifist principles to becomePennsylvania’s preeminent soldier. Washington agreed to call a council of warthat afternoon if Mifflin himself proposed the retreat, which preservedWashington’s honor because the request would come from someone else. Mifflinconcurred, but with one provision, namely that he command the last troops toevacuate and therefore run the greatest risk of being killed or captured, agesture that also preserved his own sense of honor.31[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts31]The council of war met at Four Chimneys, the baronial summer home of PhilipLivingston, which offered a panoramic view of the escape route the ContinentalArmy would take, near the modern-day Brooklyn Bridge. The conclusion wasunanimous, thereby forcing Washington to embrace a course chosen by his generalsrather than himself, allowing him to preserve the pretense that he preferred togo down fighting. All that remained was to plan and carry out the evacuation ofnearly 10,000 men without alerting the British Army of their departure over abody of water that was controlled by the British navy. One young Connecticutofficer, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, put the matter succinctly: “To move so largea body, across a river full a mile wide, with a rapid current, in face of avictorious well disciplined army nearly three times as numerous as his own and afleet capable of stopping the navigation, so that not one boat could have passedover, seemed to present most formidable obstacles.”32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts32]At least the wind was blowing the Americans’ way. A northeastern stormrestricted the movement of British warships up the East River, though it alsoposed navigation problems for American boats trying to get across. Although hehad no other choice, Washington now needed to perform one of the most brillianttactical withdrawals in the annals of military history.DECEPTION WAS THE essential ingredient in the evacuation plan. Washington issueda General Order to assemble all ships and flat-bottomed boats on Manhattan andLong Island, purportedly to ferry additional troops over from New Jersey. Thisallowed Colonel John Glover and his Massachusetts regiment of Marbleheadfishermen and seamen to gather the fleet to evacuate Long Island under thepretense of reinforcing it. The very sight of Glover and his colorfully attiredtroops, all moving with the disciplined precision acquired from years ofexperience aboard ships at sea, made an immediate impression: “These were thelads,” noted one young officer from Pennsylvania, “that might do something.”What they were in fact about to do was show this army of amateur soldiers how aregiment of seasoned seamen staged a rescue operation at night.33[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts33]Only a few of the officers and none of the enlisted men knew that an evacuationwas under way. In some units, when ordered to go “under arms with packs,” thetroops assumed they were about to attack the British trenches and proceeded tomake out their wills in anticipation of certain death. Joseph Plumb Martinremembered the sudden code of silence: “We were strictly enjoined not to speak,or even cough. All orders were given from officer to officer, and communicatedto men in whispers.” Tench Tilghman, a young lieutenant soon to become one ofWashington’s most trusted aides, reported that whole regiments moved to the rearwithout knowing their destination: “The thing was conducted with so much secrecythat neither subalterns nor privates knew that the whole army was to cross backagain to New York.”34 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts34]The tactical retreat of an entire army currently engaged with a larger enemyforce is so difficult to orchestrate because units have to be removed piecemeal,in staggered fashion, leaving a sufficient complement of troops to hold theperimeter. Timing, therefore, has to be precise, and the remaining troops needto spread out to replace those just evacuated. A nearly fatal blunder occurredon Brooklyn Heights midway through the evacuation, when Mifflin received anorder to withdraw all his troops. The order was a mistake, since Mifflin’s menwere supposed to leave last and their withdrawal would leave the American frontfully exposed. Mifflin questioned the order but reluctantly obeyed it.As he led his troops back toward the ferry, Washington rode up and demanded toknow what Mifflin was doing. “Good God! General Mifflin, I am afraid you haveruined us,” he shouted. Mifflin, understandably exasperated and confused,explained the communication error, then led his troops back to the trenches.Though the American position had been undefended for over an hour, the Britishnever noticed.35 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts35]This piece of good fortune was more than matched when the northeastern stormsubsided and the winds shifted to the southeast, which greatly facilitated themovement of Glover’s boats across the East River. The weather change should haveprompted the appearance of British warships on the water, which would havetransformed the American evacuation into a full-scale massacre, since theoverloaded rowboats were defenseless. But Lord Howe, uncharacteristically, nevernoticed the wind shift and never brought the British fleet into play.He was preoccupied with dinner conversation aboard the Eagle, his flagship,where the two captured American generals, Stirling and Sullivan, were hisguests, and Lord Richard was fixated on discovering whether the recenthumiliation of the Continental Army might have changed their minds about hisproposals for a peaceful end to the rebellion. Like his brother, if not more so,Richard Howe’s fondest hope was for diplomatic reconciliation rather thanmilitary victory, and at this fateful moment that was where his fullestattentions were focused.The gods smiled on the American escape one final time on the morning of August30. The last troops to evacuate were most at risk, in part because no oneremained in the rear to cover their retreat, in part because they would have tosneak out in broad daylight. Major Tallmadge remembered it well many yearslater:As the dawn of the next day approached, those of us who remained in the trenchesbecame very anxious for our own safety.… At this time a very dense fog began torise, and it seemed to settle in a peculiar manner over both encampments. Irecollect this peculiar providential occurrence perfectly well; and so verydense was the atmosphere that I could scarcely discern a man at six yards’distance.… In the history of warfare I do not recollect a more fortunateretreat.36 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts36]As Tallmadge was being rowed across, he looked back to see Washington steppinginto the last boat to leave Long Island. It was the stuff of legend. In allnearly 10,000 men were safely ferried to Manhattan with only three stragglerslost. The planning had to be precise, the officers and men needed to behave withuncommon courage, the winds and river currents had to be properly aligned, theRoyal Navy had to be negligent, and, finally, a dense fog had to make aprovidential appearance at the end. And all these ingredients had to cometogether in the proper sequence. Although successful retreats seldom win wars,in this instance the evacuation of Long Island meant that the Continental Armywould live to fight another day. One could be forgiven for believing that “TheCause” could never die.The initial response on the British side was utter disbelief that Washington hadsomehow managed to extract his entire army without being noticed. The Americans,so it seemed to several British officers, had shown themselves to be whollyinadequate on the field of battle, but brilliant in their talent at runningaway.The prevailing British impression, beyond astonishment, was that the spirit ofthe Continental Army had been broken on Long Island, the utter futility ofconfronting the British army and navy had been convincingly demonstrated, and ithad been achieved with relatively few British casualties. In short, all ofGeneral Howe’s campaign goals had been met. As one British general, Lord HughPercy, put it: “I may venture to assert that they will never again stand beforeus in the field. Everything seems to be over with them, and I flatter myselfthat this campaign will put a total end to the war.”37[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts37]There were, however, dissenting voices. Captain George Collier, commander of thewarship Rainbow, thought that each of the Howe brothers had missed anopportunity to destroy or capture the entire American army on Long Island.General Howe’s decision to halt the British assault on the forts at BrooklynHeights looked less convincing now that Washington had escaped the trap. AndAdmiral Howe’s failure to throw the British fleet into the East River, whichCollier claimed “we have been in constant expectation of being ordered to do,”struck Collier as inexplicable, since only a few British frigates would havemeant that “not a man would have escaped from Long Island.” Whether suchopportunities would come again no one could say. “Now, I foresee,” Collierlamented, “they [the Americans] will give us trouble enough, and protract thewar, Heaven knows how long.”38 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts38]NEWS OF THE American defeat slowly dribbled into the Continental Congress, inpart because Washington was too exhausted to file a report. “For Forty EightHours,” he explained to Hancock, “I had hardly been off my Horse and neverclosed my Eyes, so that I was quite unfit to write or dictate.” His eventualreport emphasized the successful evacuation from Long Island, played down thedebacle on Gowanus Heights, and provided an inflated estimate of Britishcasualties, thereby conveniently obscuring the full scope of the militarydisaster and the dispirited condition of the Continental Army. Gossip mills atWashington’s headquarters on Manhattan began to circulate the opinion thatGreene’s unfortunate absence was the primary cause of the defeat: that if Greenehad been commanding on Long Island, the whole battle would have gonedifferently.39 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts39]The General Orders for August 31 sustained the same patriotic rhetoric as beforethe battle, suggesting that nothing had really changed: “From the justice of ourcause, America can only expect success,” it read. “Now is the time for every manto exert himself, and make our Country glorious, or it will becomecontemptible.” In order to set an example, Washington deliberately chose toexpose himself to British artillery fire from the Long Island shore. After tworounds missed overhead, and having made his point, Washington allowed his staffto lead him away.40 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts40]By any detached measure, the Continental Army had suffered a humiliating defeat.And according to General Howe’s strategic calibrations, the political andpsychological consequences of that crushing experience should have shocked theleadership of the American rebellion into the realization that their gloriouscause was, in truth, a hopeless waste of blood and treasure. Washington’sinitial management of the after-action reports undercut Howe’s strategy byconcealing the depth of the disaster, a justifiable distortion from hisperspective in order to reduce the sudden impact that the military debacle mighthave on popular opinion. If he had failed to control the movement of his troopson the battlefield, he would attempt to control the perception of the battle’sconsequences in that larger battle for popular opinion.Down in Philadelphia, Adams was having similar thoughts. He had originallyintended to return to Braintree and his family. But a premonition that the newsfrom New York might be bad convinced him to remain at his station: “Indeed, ifthe Decision should be unfortunate…, perhaps I may be as well calculated toSustain such a Shock, as Some others.” He worried most about the psychologicaleffect of Howe’s victory on the faint of heart in the congress and on theso-called half-Tories out there in the countryside. “The Panic may seize whom itwill,” he confided to Abigail, “it shall not sieze me. I will stay here untilthe public Countenance is better, or much worse. It must and will be better.”41[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts41]Adams’s first instinct was to minimize the damage by claiming that matters couldhave been much worse. If the Howe brothers had failed in New York, he arguedsomewhat dubiously, they would have attacked Boston, and its loss would havebeen more devastating. Then he argued that the very enormity of the Britishvictory would prove to be a military liability. “If they get Possession of NewYork, Long Island, and Staten Island,” he observed, “these are more Territorythan their whole Army can defend.” According to this line of thought, which wasat best counterintuitive, every British military victory only increased theburden of occupation, implying that the best way to win the war was to loseevery battle. Arguments like this suggest that Adams could not acknowledge anypossibility of an American military defeat leading to British victory in thewar.The truth was that the amateur status of the Continental Army had been exposedin no uncertain terms on Long Island, and all the platitudinous incantationsabout the moral superiority of the American cause had fallen victim to themilitary superiority of a professional army. These were uncomfortable facts thatAdams, like Washington, needed to obscure, even to himself.42[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts42]If all Americans were like his beloved Abigail, Adams would not have faced apolitical problem. Like her husband, Abigail was resolute. “We seem to be keptin total Ignorance of affairs at [New] York,” she observed, insisting that “ifour Army is in ever so critical a state, I wish to know it, and the worst ofit.” She was prepared to know the unvarnished truth because she was beyondcompromise. “But if we should be defeated” she insisted, “I think we shall notbe conquered.” In response to her request for a candid assessment of theAmerican performance on Long Island, Adams was elegantly succinct: “In general,our Generals were out generalled.”43[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts43]Adams was particularly attuned to gauging sudden shifts in the politicalweather. The preceding spring, he had watched with a combination of admirationand amazement as popular opinion shifted quite dramatically toward independencein response to George III’s decision to impose a military solution on theAmerican rebellion. Now he sensed a shift in the other direction in response tothe disaster on Long Island: “The Successes of Howe have given a strange Springof Toryism,” as another delegate put it. “Men who have hitherto lurked insilence and neutrality seem willing to take a side in opposition to theliberties of their Country.” Washington had even been heard to predict that moreAmerican volunteers in New York and New Jersey were likely to join Howe thanenlist in the Continental Army.44 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts44]The correspondence of other delegates to the Continental Congress suggests thatAdams was not alone in attempting to manage the political momentum. AlthoughBenjamin Rush confessed to his wife that the setback in New York had transformedthe political climate and that matters were likely to get worse rather thanbetter, in letters to others he put the best face on the current crisis. “I cantherefore from authority assure you,” he wrote a French friend, “that a fixeddetermination still prevails in that body [the Continental Army] to establishthe liberties of America or to perish in their ruins. No difficulties discourageus, no losses depress us.”45 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts45]Franklin joined the chorus, though in his case there was no need to stretch thetruth, since he remained confident that Howe’s victory was merely a minorsetback, a brief chapter in the eventual and inevitable story of Americantriumph. He acknowledged that British troops “have been rather too Strong forour people to cope with, and consequently have succeeded in their interprizes,which have not been of the importance that they will probably seem to theWorld.” Franklin held firm to his elemental conviction that the British militarymission in America was impossible, and nothing about the recent British successhad changed his mind: “For what have they done?” he asked rhetorically. “Theyhave got possession of three small islands on the coast of America…, and yet ifevery Acre of American territory is contested in the same Proportion, theConquest would ruin all Europe.”46[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts46]In the spectrum of political opinion within the Continental Congress, Adams andFranklin were among the most resolute in believing that, having crossed the linetoward independence, there could be no turning back, regardless of what happenedto Washington’s army in New York. Then, in the first week of September, adramatic event galvanized opinion among the other delegates within the congressaround a nonnegotiable strategy.47[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts47]The event was General John Sullivan’s arrival in Philadelphia. Recall thatSullivan, along with Stirling, had dined with Lord Howe on board the Eagle thenight that Washington’s army escaped across the East River. During the dinner,Lord Richard managed to persuade the earnest Sullivan that his peace commissionempowered him to offer generous terms that would allow the Americans to end thissenseless and unnecessary war with their honor intact. Howe had then offered tosend Sullivan on parole to apprise the congress of these terms.In his report, Sullivan described Lord Howe’s utter sincerity. Then he arguedthat by sending him to Philadelphia, Howe was implicitly recognizing theauthority and legitimacy of the Continental Congress. More substantially, Howehad made clear his personal opinion “that Parliament had no right to tax Americaor meddle with her internal Polity,” and he was confident that George III andhis ministers were now open to such an arrangement once hostilities ceased.48[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts48]Sullivan’s report provoked a vigorous debate. Rush subsequently remembered thatAdams leaned over during the debate “and whispered to me a wish that the firstball that had been fired on the day of the defeat of our army [on Long Island]had gone through his [Sullivan’s] head.” Adams then rose to protest theproceedings, calling Sullivan “a decoy duck whom Lord Howe has sent among us toseduce us into renunciation of our independence.”49[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts49]The following day, September 5, John Witherspoon of New Jersey delivered themajor speech denouncing Lord Howe’s proposals, and no one rose to challenge hisconclusions. “It is plain,” Witherspoon argued, “that absolute submission iswhat they require us to agree to,” so that despite the appearance of generosity,Lord Howe “has uniformly avoided any circumstance that can imply that we areanything else but subjects of the king of Great Britain, in rebellion.” Onceframed in that fashion, only an outright loyalist could embrace Howe’s terms,and no such creature could be found in the Continental Congress. Those delegateswho had been shaken by events in New York and were harboring doubts had nowhereelse to go.50 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts50]The only controversy arose over how to reply to Lord Howe, if at all. TrustingSullivan to deliver their answer was unacceptable, since his reputation, alreadytarnished by his conduct on Gowanus Heights, was now in deeper decline for hishaving been duped by Howe. But failure to respond might be perceived by lukewarmpatriots as excessively defiant. Best not to risk losing them and to err on theside of diplomacy.Howe had offered to receive a delegation from the congress, but only in theircapacity as private citizens, since his instructions prohibited him fromrecognizing the legitimacy of the Continental Congress. The delegates tossedthis diplomatic problem back in his face with the following resolution:“Resolved that this body cannot with propriety send any of its members to conferwith His Lordship in their private characters.” On the other hand, “everdesirous of establishing peace on reasonable terms, they will send a Committeeof their body, to know whether he has any Authority to meet with personsauthorized by Congress for that purpose in behalf of America.” Given hisinstructions, Howe either could refuse to meet with the American delegation,thereby assuming responsibility for the diplomatic impasse, or he could meetwith but then acknowledge that he had no authority to negotiate withrepresentatives of an American government. In either case, the peace initiativewould be exposed as a diplomatic mirage.51[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts51]THE FOLLOWING DAY, September 6, the congress chose Adams, Franklin, and EdwardRutledge of South Carolina to meet with Lord Howe on Staten Island. Theselection of Adams and Franklin ensured an interesting conversation that wouldend in failure, since Adams was high on the list of prominent American rebelsscheduled for public hanging for treason if and when Howe’s peace terms wereaccepted. And Franklin, Howe’s former friend, had recently advised him that hismilitary mission was hopeless and that continued service in this ill-fated causewould destroy his reputation forever.Even though the conclusion was foreordained, the meeting on September 11 was adramatic occasion. Clearly, Howe held out the hope that the recent Americancatastrophe on Long Island might have generated second thoughts among theAmericans about the prospects for an easy exit from the British Empire. Just asclearly, the American delegation came to the conference determined to dash thathope. Not quite so clearly, but most probably, a poll of the American populationwould have revealed a citizenry more politically divided and receptive to Howe’sterms than the Continental Congress or its diplomatic representatives.Unfortunately for Howe, polls were not possible.Diplomatic etiquette on both sides was almost excessively correct. Howe hadarranged to leave a British officer as a hostage at Perth Amboy, where theAmericans disembarked, as a guarantee of their safety once in British hands.Adams insisted that no hostage was necessary, since Lord Howe’s word was amore-than-sufficient guarantee. “You make me a very high Compliment,” Howeobserved, “and you may depend on it, I will consider it the most sacred ofthings.” An honor guard of resplendent British grenadiers ushered the Americansinto the meeting place with all the ceremonial trappings. Inside, Howe had laidout a sumptuous spread of “good Claret, good Bread, Cold Ham, Tongues andMutton.” The civilities were assiduously observed.52[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts52]Howe began by pleading his sincerity as a famous friend of America. He explainedthat he had delayed his voyage for several weeks in order to acquireinstructions as a peace commissioner, but that very delay had meant that hearrived just after passage of the Declaration of Independence. “Is there no wayof treading back this step of Independence,” he asked, “and opening the door toa full discussion?”53 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts53]Adams and Franklin led the American response, which was polite but whollynegative. If the British ministry had recognized American sovereignty overtaxation and its own domestic affairs a year earlier, the conflict could almostcertainly have been avoided. But that was then and this was now. Adams spelledout the British transgressions since the outbreak of hostilities at Lexingtonand Concord, culminating in the very invasion force that Lord Howe nowco-commanded. In response to this long string of abuses, the American states hadvoted unanimously for independence, and the Continental Congress had ratifiedthat vote, which could not be undone. In fact, the American delegation was justas powerless to reverse that verdict as Howe was to recognize them as Americancitizens rather than as British subjects. When Howe explained that he preferredto regard his guests as fellow gentlemen, Adams replied that his Lordship wasfree to meet with them in any capacity he wished, “except that of Britishsubjects.”54 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts54]The unspoken item on the agenda, which Howe thought awkward to address directly,was the recent action on Long Island, which surely cast at least a shadow ofdoubt over American prospects for success against the vastly superior Britisharmy and navy. Howe’s more elliptical way of raising the issue was to expresshis deep affection for America, then add that “if America should fall, he shouldfeel and lament it like the loss of a brother.” Years later Adams stillremembered with relish Franklin’s deft response: “Dr. Franklin, with an easy airand a collected countenance, a bow, a smile and all the Naïveté which sometimesappeared in his conversation … replied ‘My Lord, we will do our utmost to saveyour Lordship that mortification.’ ”55[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts55]Rutledge then proposed that since American independence was a nonnegotiablefact, perhaps Howe could persuade his friends back in London to embrace it andthen make an economic alliance with the United States with all its attendantcommercial advantages for both parties. Howe expressed his doubts that any ofhis superiors in London would find that idea acceptable; nor was it what he hadin mind.56 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts56]There was really nothing more to say. Despite the military setback on LongIsland, not to mention the highly precarious status of the Continental Army onManhattan, nothing had changed in the American political posture. Ambrose Serle,Howe’s snobbish secretary, was furious. His summation of the proceedings,recorded in his journal that night, was terse and vitriolic: “They met, theytalked, they parted. And now nothing remains but to fight it out against a Setof the most determined Hypocrites & Demagogues compiled by the refuse of theColonies that ever were permitted by Providence to be the Scourge of aCountry.”57 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts57]Adams went back to Philadelphia equally angry. He told Sam Adams that “the wholeAffair … appears to me, as it ever did, to be a bubble, an Ambuscade, a mereinsidious Maneuver, calculated only to decoy and deceive.” His only explanation,which contained more than a kernel of truth, was that “they must have a wretchedopinion of our Generalship to suppose that we can fall into it.”58[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts58]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 7[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]HEARTS AND MINDS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I give it as my opinion that a General And Speedy Retreat is absolutelyNecessary, and that the honor and Interest of America require it.—NATHANAEL GREENE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, September 5, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to the calibrated strategy of the Howe brothers, the humiliation ofthe Continental Army on Long Island was supposed to generate shock waves thatwould shake the foundation of the American rebellion. But the conference withLord Howe on Staten Island seemed to expose the flaw in that strategy, since theAmerican delegation refused to regard the debacle on Long Island as anythingmore than a temporary setback of minor significance. Adams and Franklin evenharbored the conviction that the annihilation or surrender of the entireContinental Army would have made no difference, except perhaps to prolong theinevitable American victory. The Howe brothers were trying to use their superiorarmy and navy as instruments of a not-so-gentle persuasion, but the leaders ofthe Continental Congress, having committed to American independence, were beyondpersuasion, in a zone where any prospect of reconciliation with their Britishbetters was now unimaginable.The Continental Army, on the other hand, was experiencing precisely the sense ofshock that the Howe brothers had intended to deliver. Favorable winds, shiftingriver currents, then a providential fog, had allowed Washington’s troops to makea near-miraculous escape across the East River, but their spirit had beenbroken. “Our situation is truly distressing,” Washington reported to Hancock.“The Militia, instead of calling forth their utmost efforts … are dismayed,Intractable, and Impatient to return [home]. Great numbers of them have goneoff, in some cases by whole Regiments.” As the troops arrived on Manhattan, onewitness described them as “sickly, emaciated, cast down.… In general everythingseemed to be in confusion.”1 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts1]Exact numbers are impossible to know, since Washington himself could not keeptrack of the deserters. But the best estimate is that about 10,000 militiawalked away during the first two weeks of September. Washington issued an orderto stop the deserters at King’s Bridge on the northern end of Manhattan, butquickly rescinded the order on the grounds that the militia had proven worsethan worthless, and their very presence fed an epidemic of fear and defeatism.Their departure meant that Washington commanded an army of 18,000, of whom onlyabout 13,000 were “fit for duty,” which meant that he was now outnumbered morethan two to one.2 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts2]Even those troops who were categorized as “fit for duty” were dazed anddemoralized, “constantly rambling about,” as Washington described them, “at suchdistances from their respective quarters and encampments, as not to be able tooppose the enemy in any sudden approach.” Fortunately for them and the Americancause, William Howe did not launch an invasion of Manhattan to follow up histriumph on Long Island. This delay seemed inexplicable to several Britishofficers, since it was clear that the Continental Army was wholly vulnerable,while the British Army was poised to end it all in one final battle. “For manysucceeding days did our brave veterans … stand on the banks of the East River,”remembered Captain George Collier, “like Moses on Mount Piszak, looking at theirpromised land less than half a mile away.”3[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts3]Howe’s apparent lack of initiative was, in fact, wholly in keeping with hisstrategic priorities. He was waiting to hear about the results of his brother’sconference with the rebels on Staten Island. There was no point in launchinganother military action if a diplomatic resolution of the conflict was imminent.Besides, the rebel army, if indeed it still could be described as an army, hadescaped from one trap on Long Island to another on Manhattan. There was no needto hurry, since Washington’s dispirited troops had nowhere else to go.British spies reported that American soldiers were busy plundering all the homesin the city, apparently justifying their thievery on the grounds that otherwisethe booty would fall into the hands of the British Army, which could occupy thecity whenever it chose to do so. Just as Howe had hoped, their near-deathexperience on Long Island forced them to face the fact that the defense of NewYork was, and always had been, misguided.Indeed, from the British perspective, the American rebellion had already beenquashed, and what remained was merely a mopping-up operation. Back in London,news of the Long Island victory prompted Lord Germain to initiate the paperworkfor William Howe’s elevation to a knighthood as a reward for his services inpreserving Great Britain’s empire in North America. “The leaders of therebellion have acted as I could have wished,” Germain wrote to Admiral Howe,meaning taken a stand at New York. “I trust that the deluded people will soonhave recourse to your lordship for mercy and protection, leaving their chiefs toreceive the punishment they deserve.” This presumably meant that Washington,Adams, and Franklin, among others, would go to the gallows.4[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts4]WASHINGTON REMAINED IN his quarters during the early days of September,recovering from exhaustion. The deeper truth was that he was groping toward therealization that the decision to defend New York had been an elemental mistake,and now, caught in the consequences of that mistake, he did not know what to do.The clearest recommendation came from Nathanael Greene, just released from thehospital after a near-death experience of his own: “The object underconsideration is whether a General and speedy retreat from this Island isNecessary or not. To me it appears the only Eligible plan to oppose the Enemysuccessfully and secure ourselves from disgrace. I think we have no Object onthis side of King Bridge.… I would burn the City and suburbs.” In Greene’scalculus, the survival of the Continental Army counted more than the defense ofany piece of ground. “I give it as my opinion,” he reiterated, “that a GeneralAnd Speedy Retreat is absolutely Necessary and that the honor and Interest ofAmerica require it.”5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts5]Greene was asking Washington to embrace two unpalatable and intractablerealities: first, that the decision to defend New York had been a mistake, andthe time had come to recognize that fact and cut American losses; and second,that Washington needed to subordinate his honor-driven instinct to stand andfight to larger political imperatives, which in this case meant the survival ofthe Continental Army. It was clear that Greene, unlike Adams and Franklin,believed that the destruction of the Continental Army put the movement forAmerican independence at risk.Greene’s diagnosis of Washington’s temperament was just as sharp as hisassessment of the strategic options facing the Continental Army. He recognizedthat Washington harbored a deeply ingrained sense of personal honor in which thefailure of the Continental Army cast a shadow over his own reputation. He tendedto equate retreat with defeat, and defeat with a permanent stain on his owncharacter. Within this code, a strategic retreat was dishonorable behavior, likerefusing an invitation to duel. Greene’s point was that Washington’s highestpriority must be the principled cause for which they were fighting, and therewas nothing principled or honorable about ordering the demise of the ContinentalArmy.Nevertheless, Washington’s first instinct was to reject Greene’s advice. Hiscorrespondence with Hancock at this moment was uncharacteristically unfocusedand meandering, perhaps a symptom of residual fatigue, or an aftershock from thetrauma of the Long Island disaster. (He regarded Hancock, as president of theContinental Congress, as his civilian superior, not Adams, even though Adams wasbetter informed on military matters as head of the Board of War and Ordnance.)Despite the desperate situation of the Continental Army, he was uncomfortablewith the decision to surrender New York without a fight, telling Hancock that“it would have the tendency to dispirit the Troops and enfeeble the Cause.” Itmight also have serious political consequences throughout the colonies, “wherethe Common cause may be affected by the discouragement it may throw over theminds of many…, especially after our Loss upon Long Island.” Whether the crucialconsideration was his own personal sense of honor, or the need to recover theconfidence of the army, or the fear that abandoning New York would generatedoubts in the minds of lukewarm patriots everywhere, he felt the need to deliver“a brilliant stroke” against the British on Manhattan, even if that meantrunning the risk of losing everything, including his own life, in the process.6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts6]One intriguing attempt at “a brilliant stroke” involved the deployment of aone-man submarine. As we have seen, Franklin had approached Washington severalweeks earlier about the prospect of an underwater vessel that might sink Britishwarships by cruising beneath them and attaching a delayed-reaction bomb to theirhulls. On September 6, Washington gave his approval to a pioneering effort atunderwater warfare. Despite difficulty with river currents, the experimentalsubmarine, named the Turtle, managed to get beneath Admiral Howe’s flagship, theEagle, with a 150-pound bomb but could not manage to attach it to thecopper-covered keel. If successful, the Turtle might have significantly reducedthe tactical advantage enjoyed by the British navy on the rivers surroundingManhattan. But soon after its maiden voyage, the Turtle sank in the Hudson whilebeing transported upstream for another trial run. It would take more than acentury for submarine warfare to become technologically feasible.7[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts7]On September 7, Washington convened a council of war that voted to endorse hispreference for a stand—perhaps a last stand—on Manhattan. It was a confusingdebate because Washington had received orders from the Continental Congress notto burn New York City, which some officers interpreted as an order to defend itat all costs. Washington seemed to endorse that interpretation by reminding hisfellow officers that the principle of civilian control of the military must berespected, even though it was clear that the Continental Congress did not fathomthe truly desperate situation confronting its army.Once the big decision to defend Manhattan had been made, the council of warvoted to divide its forces, placing 5,000 troops at the southern end of theisland to defend the city; 9,000 men at the northern end, where the Britishattack was most likely; and 4,000 of the newest recruits in the middle, where anattack was least likely. Because the British retained the initiative, they wouldenjoy a significant numerical advantage wherever they chose to launch theirassault.8 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts8]Washington wanted Hancock to understand that Manhattan was all but lost. “It isour Interest & wish,” he explained, “to prolong it as much as possible.” AsJoseph Reed explained to his wife, the goal was to inflict heavy losses on theBritish before surrendering, “and if a sacrifice of us can save the cause ofAmerica, there will be time to collect another army before spring, and thecountry will be preserved.” This fatalistic formulation almost surely reflectedWashington’s thinking—or what passed for thinking—at this tense and crowdedmoment. Washington was preparing to make himself into a martyr.9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts9]It is also possible that he believed he had no other choice but to sacrificehimself and the Continental Army because, outnumbered and isolated as they were,they had no realistic prospect of escaping from Manhattan. General Howe wouldhave to be a blithering idiot not to block the one avenue of escape at King’sBridge, and the American commander there, William Heath, apprised Washingtonthat he lacked the troops to stop Howe from sealing the trap. An engineeringofficer, Rufus Putnam, scouted the terrain and confirmed Heath’s assessment thatthere was no way of preventing Howe from putting the Continental Army in “a BadBox.”10 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts10]Writing from the relative security of Fishkill, the delegates of the provisionalgovernment of New York confirmed the strategic diagnosis: “We are so fullysatisfied of the Enemies Design to land above New York, and of the Mischiefsthat will result thereupon … we have Reason to dread the Consequences.” Allconcurred that British naval supremacy on the Hudson and East rivers, plusBritish superiority on the ground at the northern end of Manhattan, meant thatWashington was marooned. Since surrender was not an option, the only choice wasto fight.11 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts11]During the second week of September, three new developments combined to changeWashington’s mind. First, the Continental Congress clarified its earlier ordernot to burn the city of New York, leaving the decision to defend it toWashington’s discretion. His judgment, not theirs, was more fully informed bythe facts on the ground and enjoyed their support. Second, still waiting on wordfrom his brother about the peace initiatives, General Howe showed no inclinationto mass his army around King’s Bridge. He preferred to prepare for hisoccupation of the city and port of New York. Third, Greene lobbied his fellowgenerals for another council of war to reconsider the decision to defendManhattan, arguing that its defense was untenable and the survival of theContinental Army was synonymous with the survival of American independence. “Thepresent Case is of such Magnitude and big with such Consequences to allAmerica,” Greene insisted, “that a reconsideration of the earlier decision isimperative.”12 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts12]The day after the failed peace conference on Staten Island, on September 12, thegeneral officers voted 10–3 to reverse their decision of the preceding week.They would now abandon any defense of the city of New York and consolidate theirforce at King’s Bridge to resist the anticipated British attack there ratherthan spread the Continental Army the entire length of Manhattan. For the timebeing, they would leave 2,000 troops at Fort Washington, near the present-dayGeorge Washington Bridge, to contest British naval supremacy on the Hudson. Thenew goal was to block Howe’s likely invasion at the northern tip of Manhattan,then evacuate the entire Continental Army off the island. The new priority wasthe preservation of the army at all costs, including the loss of New York.13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts13]Washington embraced the new strategy reluctantly. It violated all his primalinstincts, his honor-driven temperament, and the military assumption he had beenharboring for the last four months about making New York a more lethal versionof Bunker Hill. In explaining the new plan to Hancock, he was almost apologetic.He wanted Hancock to know that he had fully intended to defend New York, becausehe recognized its strategic importance. “But I am fully convinced that it cannotbe done,” he pleaded, “and that an attempt for that purpose if preserved, mightand most certainly would be attended with consequences the most fatal andalarming in their nature.”14 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts14]By “fatal” he almost surely meant the destruction of the Continental Army.Whether he agreed with Greene that the end of the army meant the end of Americanindependence is not so clear. He had been regarding the American cause asinvincible for so long that it was psychologically difficult for him to give itup. But if the destruction of the Continental Army did put American independenceat risk, then it was not a risk worth running. He was fully prepared tosurrender his own life on this ground, and he wanted that fact to be known toall his officers. But matters larger than his own honor were at stake, and heneeded to subordinate his own instincts to that larger purpose.REPORTS FROM THE field began to gather on Adams’s desk in Philadelphia after hisreturn from Staten Island. His position as head of the Board of War and Ordnancemade him privy to the alarming desertion rates, the dispirited condition of theremaining troops, and what Henry Knox described as “the sense of Panic” that hadgripped the entire Continental Army in the wake of the Long Island ordeal. “Idespise that Panic and those who have been infected with it,” he apprised Knoxand half seriously urged that “the good old Roman fashion of Decimation shouldbe Introduced,” meaning that every tenth man in a demoralized regiment should beexecuted as a lesson to the others. Meanwhile, his job was to prevent theinfection from spreading to the Continental Congress, which, even more than thearmy, was the center that had to hold.15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts15]William Hooper of North Carolina reported conversations with former moderates onthe independence question, who were now whispering “I told you so” in thecorridors. But in the full-scale debate over Lord Howe’s peace initiative, ithad become clear that any chastened second thoughts generated by Howe’s victoryin New York were regarded as inadmissible; American independence remainednonnegotiable. The leadership in the congress effectively enforced a silence onthe troubling fact that they were losing the war.16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts16]This in turn meant that the political agenda should proceed apace, undistractedby unwelcome news from New York. On September 9, for example, the delegatesfinally got around to revising the style manual for all official correspondence,so that it replaced “United Colonies” with “United States.” On September 17,they adopted the final draft of Adams’s Plan of Treaties, designed to forge adiplomatic alliance with France, subsequently choosing Jefferson to join SilasDeane in Paris to negotiate the treaty. (Jefferson declined for personalreasons, chiefly the fragile health of his wife.) On September 20, they approvedanother Adams draft, the Articles of War, which standardized regulations forpromotions, procedures, and punishments within the Continental Army and whichAdams freely acknowledged “were copied from the British Articles of War, TotidemVerbia.”17 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts17]The underlying presumption remained that regardless of what happened on thebattlegrounds of New York, the American Revolution was going forward. If Adamsneeded any boost to his revolutionary confidence—and he did not—he received itfrom his indomitable Abigail. If all the men in Washington’s army were killed orcaptured, she declared, the Howe brothers would have to contend with “a race ofAmazons in America.”18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts18]While the British had convinced themselves that the war was all but over, theleaders in the congress wanted to make a clear statement that it had barelybegun. For months, Washington had been warning that an American army ofshort-termers supplemented with militia could not compete on an equal basisagainst British regulars. Now the fiasco on Long Island and the demoralized anddeteriorating condition of the troops on Manhattan had proven his point. “We arenow, as it were, upon the eve of another dissolution of our Army,” he warnedHancock, meaning that desertions were increasing and enlistments were about toexpire, “and unless some speedy and effectual measures are adopted by Congress,our cause will be lost.”19 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts19]Greene chimed in with a rant against the illusory prowess of militia, nowdeserting in droves. “The policy of Congress has been the most absurd andridiculous imaginable,” he wrote his brother, “pouring in militia who come andgo every month. A military force established on such principles defeats itself.”Washington seconded the verdict, observing that if the battle of Long Islandtaught anything, it was that “to place any dependence on Militia is, assuredly,resting upon a broken staff.”20 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts20]Unknown to Washington and Greene, the Continental Congress had already voted togive them everything they were asking for and more. On September 16, thedelegates ordered the creation of 88 new battalions, another 60,000 men.Enlistments would be encouraged by signing bonuses of $20, and enlistments “forthe duration” by the promise of 100 acres of western land at the end of thewar.21 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts21]In order to implement this order, troop quotas were established for each stateaccording to population. (Interestingly, although the delegates could not agreeon whether representation in the new government should be by state orproportional according to population, they easily agreed that big states likeVirginia and Massachusetts should bear a larger burden militarily.) Hancockwrote to the governors of all the states, urging them to “bend all yourAttention to raise your Quota of the American Army.”22[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts22]This new initiative reflected the recognition that events in New York had dashedall hopes for a short war. As Washington put it, the winning of independence “isnot likely to be the Work of a day.” Moreover, in the kind of prolonged strugglethey now faced, reliance on patriotic zeal, much like reliance on militia, wouldno longer suffice. “When men are irritated & the Passions inflamed, they flyhastily and cheerfully to Arms,” Washington intoned in his most realistic mode.But those heady days were now over, and the war was entering a new phase inwhich discipline and endurance replaced patriotic virtue as the ingredientsessential for victory. “To expect among such People as compose the bulk of theArmy that they are influenced by any other Principles than those of Interest,”Washington warned, “is to look for what never did, & I fear never willhappen.”23 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts23]The decision by the Continental Congress represented a collective commitment toprovide Washington with the kind of permanent standing army he believednecessary to win the war. It also represented a symbolic statement of politicalresolve that, no matter what happened to Washington’s army on Manhattan, thepool of manpower available to the American cause was virtually inexhaustible, amessage calculated to generate tremors in the corridors of Whitehall.But the decision was also symbolic in another sense, for its implementationdepended upon compliance by all the state legislatures, which were predisposedto fund militias within their own borders rather than recruits for theContinental Army. And since a mandatory draft defied the republican principlesthat they were all purportedly fighting for, the order was really a request, andcompliance was wholly voluntary, which meant that a new 60,000-man army wasnever going to happen. Washington might well have argued that republicanprinciples were meaningless if America lost the war, and the leadership of theContinental Congress obviously agreed. But the political reality was that thedelegates in Philadelphia were making a promise they could not keep.To be sure, all the state governments remained resolute on the question ofAmerican independence. (The Howes had expected some defections after LongIsland.) But when it came to providing money and men for the Continental Army,each state government made the protection of its own citizenry the highestpriority. They were no more willing to cede authority to the ContinentalCongress than they were to recognize the sovereign authority of Parliament. Theywere united on the question of independence, but only as long as each state waspermitted to pursue that goal as it saw fit.IT IS DIFFICULT to generalize about the bulk of the American citizenry. Noquestion, these were the most important hearts and minds of all and thereforethe ultimate target of the Howe strategy, which intended the humiliation of theContinental Army to serve as a demonstration of British military superiority.Something akin to a referendum on independence had occurred in May and June,with decisive results. Would the results be equally decisive or dangerouslydivisive if a referendum occurred in September?No such referendum occurred, of course, but even if it had, no major changewould have been likely, because most of the population remained ignorant thatthe Continental Army had suffered any kind of defeat at all. And the simplereason for the widespread ignorance was that American newspapers did not reportit. Abigail Adams was reading the newspapers as intensively as anyone, and shecomplained about the lack of coverage: “We seem to be kept in a total Ignoranceof affairs at [New] York.… Who fell, who [were] wounded, who made prisoner ortheir Numbers is as undetermined as it was the day after the Battle. If our armyis in ever so critical a state, I wish to know it, and the worst of it.”24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts24]In fact, one of the Boston newspapers Abigail was reading, The New EnglandChronicle, reported a glorious American victory on Long Island.The ministerial army attacked our lines on Long Island at three differentplaces, with their utmost force; but the intrepidity of the soldiers of theUnited States, joined with that vigor becoming to a free people, repulsed them;that they were obliged to retreat precipitously, with great loss, theparticulars of which we have not yet been able to learn.The Chronicle also reported, prominently but inaccurately, the death of GeneralJames Grant, the British officer who had previously predicted that he couldsubdue the American rebellion in a matter of weeks with 5,000 British regulars.Several other newspapers picked up this story, which had great patriotic appealgiven Grant’s disdain for the fighting prowess of American troops.25[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts25]The Connecticut Courant accurately described the size of the British and Hessianinvasion force and the encirclement of American troops on Gowanus Heights, butthen reported that the beleaguered Americans “bravely fought their way throughthe enemy, killing great numbers of them and brought off many prisoners.” ThePennsylvania Packet repeated this version of the battle almost word-for-word,but then added the firsthand description, wholly fabricated, of “the gloriousdeath of General Stirling from a witness who was close to him when he fell.”The Newport Mercury printed an account by a Rhode Island soldier that accuratelydescribed the heavy American losses and Stirling’s bravery as well as hiscapture but emphasized the steadfast courage and eventual victory of theAmerican troops, despite being outnumbered. The Virginia Gazette emphasized the“high spirits” of the Continental Army on the eve of the battle, but thenoffered no coverage of the battle itself. A later story erroneously reportedthat “General Howe had his leg dangerously shattered by a ball” and that anepidemic had broken out among the Hessian troops, who were purportedly on theverge of mutiny.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts26]Virtually all of the newspapers provided extensive and accurate coverage of themeeting with Lord Howe on Staten Island and the subsequent rejection of hispeace initiative by the Continental Congress, a decision that received editorialaccolades from all quarters as the proper statement of American defiance. Only afew papers mentioned the charmed and desperate escape at night over the EastRiver to Manhattan, presumably because it did not square with earlier accountsof American victory on Long Island.27[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts27]The press, in short, did not provide an unbiased version of the Battle of LongIsland or the glaring problems within the Continental Army. In this highlycharged and vulnerable moment, loyalty to “The Cause” trumped all conventionaldefinitions of the truth so completely that journalistic integrity became almosttreasonable. As a result, there was little discernible wavering in thecommitment to American independence in any province beyond the New York theater,where loyalists were volunteering in droves to join the British Army. Thepartisan American press had concealed the full extent of the demoralizedcondition of the Continental Army. Few Americans knew they were losing the war.ON SEPTEMBER 12, General Howe learned that his brother’s efforts at negotiationhad failed. This was the same day that the council of war decided to abandon thedefense of Manhattan. From Howe’s perspective, this meant that the city and portof New York had to be taken. The irascible Clinton questioned this decision,proposing a diversion toward lower Manhattan, followed by the main attack atKing’s Bridge, thereby “corking the bottle” and sealing the entire ContinentalArmy on the island. “Had this been done without loss of time,” Clinton laterclaimed in his Memoirs, “while the rebel army lay broken in separatecorps … each part of it [must have] fallen into our power one after theother.”28 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts28]Hindsight is not required to recognize the strategic wisdom of Clinton’sproposal. All of Washington’s general officers realized that the Howe brothershad it in their power to entrap them on Manhattan, which Reed described as “thistongue of land, where we ought never have been.” Indeed, this was precisely thereason why they voted to move the entire army to the northern end of Manhattan,where they would then try to fight their way off the island.29[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts29]The only dissenters happened to be the two commanders in chief. Washingtonreluctantly accepted that the city and port of New York could not be defendedonce the British occupied Brooklyn Heights, but he was still searching for a wayto engage the British Army on Manhattan before escaping to the mainland. TheLong Island humiliation had to be redeemed, the officers and men of theContinental Army needed to have their confidence restored, and “The Cause”needed a victory of some sort, no matter how token.Both of the Howe brothers detested Clinton and would have rejected his strategicadvice even if it had come with endorsements from the gods. But moresignificantly, it was now abundantly clear that they did not want to trap anddestroy the Continental Army on Manhattan. Despite the disappointing results ofLord Howe’s conference on Staten Island, they retained the conviction thatsupport for the rebellion was skin-deep, and they regarded their role as peacecommissioners as more important than their role as military commanders. Theywanted to limit the carnage on both sides until the Americans came to theirsenses. Intriguingly, both Washington and the Howes were subordinating militarystrategy to the larger battle for hearts and minds.AFTER EXPLORING SEVERAL options on the east side of Manhattan for their attack,the Howes chose Kip’s Bay, between what is now Thirty-second and Thirty-eighthstreets. On the morning of September 15, 4,000 British and Hessian troops weretransported across the East River, preceded by five warships that had anchoredin the bay that night, poised to lay down an artillery barrage before theinvasion. Ironically, the American evacuation of Manhattan was already underway, so if the British had waited another day, they would have landedunopposed.30 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts30]Instead, the shoreline at Kip’s Bay was defended by about 800 Connecticutmilitiamen and recent recruits to the Continental Army, including Joseph PlumbMartin. These were the most inexperienced troops under Washington’s command.Their defensive position consisted of a shallow trench topped off by mounds ofdirt. Many had only spears for weapons. No orders had been issued about how torespond to an attack, except to hold their position. At daylight, Martinremembered looking out at the British warships and the upward of eighty cannonsleveled at his ditch, wondering what he was supposed to do.The answer to that question became obvious as soon as the naval barrage began.All five ships let loose at once, producing a display of firepower that severalBritish naval officers described as more intense than any they had everwitnessed. Within minutes the American defensive line was blown away, andMartin, as he put it, “began to consider which part of my carcass was to gofirst.” The bombardment lasted for a full hour, during which time one Britishship, the Orpheus, expended over 5,000 pounds of gunpowder. By that time Martinand his fellow soldiers, quite understandably, had long since decided to fleethe killing zone as quickly as possible. The British and Hessian troops landedunopposed, without a single casualty. The few American soldiers who remained inthe trench were summarily executed when they tried to surrender. It was LongIsland all over again.31 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts31]Clinton led the invasion force, and he was under orders to seize the beachhead,then await the arrival of the second wave of 9,000 British troops led by Howe.Since he was unopposed, Clinton could have moved across Manhattan and therebycut off the 5,000 American troops under Putnam coming up from the south. ButClinton obeyed his orders, against his own better judgment, which allowed “OldPut” to squeeze past the British and Hessian force on what is now RiversideDrive. His precocious young aide, Aaron Burr, had identified the escape route.What happened next was one of the low points for the American side in the war.The panic that seized the troops fleeing the bombardment at Kip’s Bay was aplausible response to the overwhelming firepower of the British navy. But asthey fled north, their fear proved contagious, creating an epidemic of shockthat caused whole regiments of Connecticut militia and levies to toss asidetheir muskets and knapsacks when confronted by only token British opposition.“The demons of fear and disorder seemed to take full possession of all andeverything that day,” Martin remembered. The retreat became a rout.32[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts32]Washington encountered the frantic troops in full flight while riding south fromhis headquarters to the sound of gunfire. He made a futile effort to establishorder by instructing officers to make a stand behind a stone wall, but the menjust ran past him. One witness reported that “he struck several officers [withhis riding crop] in their flight, three times dashed his hatt to the ground, andat last exclaimed, ‘Good God, have I got such Troops as these?’ ” Theapproaching British infantry came within fifty yards, but his staff could notpersuade their commander to leave the field. Eventually Joseph Reed grabbed thereins of his horse and led Washington to safety, cursing all the way. The nextday, Greene recalled the scene, claiming that Washington was “so vext that hesought Death rather than life.”33 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts33]The man of almost preternatural control lost it all in that terrifying momentand was fortunate to escape death or capture. For Washington, it was the nadir,the conclusive demonstration that all his hopes for the fighting prowess of theContinental Army had been delusional. And since he regarded the army as aprojection of himself, the events of the day spread a stain over his ownreputation that he found intolerable, in his honor-driven world worse than deathitself. When word of the debacle reached Adams two days later, he too wasstunned, though he did not take the humiliation personally. “I am so outraged bythe infamous cowardice of the New England troops,” he observed, “that I amashamed of my Country.”34 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts34]But even cowardice had an upside, since the headlong flight of the troops meantthat most of them made it safely to the American lines at Harlem Heights. Thenumber of killed, wounded, or captured was only a fraction of the losses on LongIsland, even though the sting of the defeat was more painful for Washington.Meanwhile, the Howe brothers could be excused for basking in the reflected glowof their triumph. With only negligible casualties, they had captured theirprimary objective, the city and port of New York, and had delivered anotherdevastating blow to the military pretensions of the Continental Army along theway. All was going according to plan.Lord Howe sensed that this second thrashing might have cracked the will of therebels, much as the naval barrage at Kip’s Bay had broken the spirit of thehelpless defenders in their pitiful ditch. On September 19, he issued aproclamation to “the American people,” thereby bypassing the delegates in theContinental Congress, who had shown themselves to be beyond redemption orrational recognition of their predicament, and appealed to the populace atlarge.He urged them “to judge for themselves whether it be more consistent with theirhonor and happiness to offer up their lives as a sacrifice to the unjust andprecarious cause in which they are engaged.” (After Kip’s Bay, that cause waspresumably even more precarious.) If they would only abandon their pretense ofindependence and “return to their old allegiance,” the unnecessary bloodlettingwould stop, and they would enjoy “the blessings of peace … and the fullenjoyment of their liberty and property.” Whether or not this message was morecredible in the wake of the Kip’s Bay disaster can never be known, since onlythe loyalist press in New York and New Jersey saw fit to publish it. Washingtondismissed Lord Howe’s appeal as old wine in old bottles, in effect requiringtotal submission “after which His Majesty would consider whether or who shouldbe hung.”35 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts35][images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_002_r1.jpg]HARLEM HEIGHTS WAS A rocky plateau running across Manhattan just north of whatis now 125th Street. Its southern border was protected by a line of steepbluffs, some sixty feet tall, creating a ridgeline that resembled a naturalfortress. If there was a rough equivalent to Bunker Hill on the island, this wasit.36 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts36]For that very reason, it was selected as the rallying point in the Americanevacuation, as the Continental Army moved all its troops and equipment to thenorthern end of Manhattan. By the evening of September 15, the traumatizedsurvivors of Kip’s Bay had reached the safe haven of Harlem Heights, as had theexhausted troops under “Old Put,” who had somehow eluded the British on theirforced march up the western side of Manhattan.It had not been a good day for the American cause. About 60 troops had beenkilled or wounded, another 300 taken prisoner. As on Long Island, the onlyconspicuous talent the Continental Army had demonstrated was its impressiveskill at running away.From his new headquarters (now the Jumel Mansion, on the brink of Coogan’s Bluffat 161st Street), Washington enjoyed a panoramic view of the entire island. Hisfocus was south, where he presumed Howe was preparing an attack on HarlemHeights. In fact, Howe was establishing his own headquarters in New York City,where the bulk of the residents were greeting the British Army as liberators.Indeed, a frontal assault on the formidable defenses at Harlem Heights neveroccurred to Howe, for the same reason that he had refused to attack BrooklynHeights. He was unwilling to risk the casualties.Washington’s mood was somber, verging on fatalistic. A letter to LundWashington, his cousin and manager at Mount Vernon, conveyed his sense that theend was near:In short, such is my situation that if I were to wish the bitterest curse to anenemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings.…In confidence I will tell you that I was never in such an unhappy, divided statesince I was born.… If I fall, it may not be amiss that these circumstances beknown, and declaration made to the justice of my character. And if the men willstand by me (which by the by I despair of), I am resolved not to be forced fromthis ground while I have life.37 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts37]In preparation for what he seemed to regard as Washington’s last stand, heordered the bulk of the troops to begin digging trenches and constructingredoubts. But in order to discover the disposition of British troops to thesouth, he also ordered a reconnaissance by a recently organized elite unit ofConnecticut rangers led by Colonel Thomas Knowlton.Knowlton was a thirty-six-year-old veteran of the French and Indian War whoseheroics at Bunker Hill had already become legendary. (John Trumbull saw fit tomake Knowlton the central figure in his depiction of the battle, which currentlyhangs in the Capitol Rotunda.) In the postmortem after the Kip’s Bay fiasco,there was a consensus that a lack of leadership within the officer corps hadbeen a major source of the failure, but Knowlton embodied the highest combatleadership standard in the Continental Army. Aaron Burr had been heard to remarkthat “it was impossible to promote such a man too rapidly.”38[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts38]About a half mile south of Harlem Heights (near the present juncture of 107thStreet and Riverside Drive), Knowlton’s 120 men encountered a British infantryregiment of 400 regulars. A fierce skirmish ensued, with the Americans firing toexcellent effect from behind a stone wall. But then a regiment of ScottishHighlanders, the renowned Black Watch, appeared, and Knowlton, now badlyoutnumbered, retreated toward Harlem Heights. The British were so accustomed toseeing American troops in flight that a bugler sounded the signal used infoxhunts at the end of the chase when the fox is trapped.This enraged Washington and his staff, who also recognized that the roughly1,000 British and Scottish troops, in their exuberance, had overextendedthemselves and were walking into a trap, enveloped by an American force tentimes their size. Washington sent Joseph Reed to the scene with orders forKnowlton, reinforced by Virginia Continentals under the command of Major AndrewLeitch, to flank the British and get behind them while several Americanregiments came down from Harlem Heights to engage them at the front. Thisenvelopment tactic failed when the Virginia troops fired on the British beforethey were behind them. In the firefight that ensued, both sides took heavycasualties, including Leitch and Knowlton, who was hit in the lower back whileexhorting his men from an exposed ledge. His purported last words, duly reportedwithin weeks in most American newspapers, were the stuff of martyrdom: “I do notvalue my life if we do but get this day.”39[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts39]Both sides then threw more men into the action, transforming a skirmish into theBattle of Harlem Heights. The British made a stand in a wheat field just southof the present Grant’s Tomb and, after two hours of ferocious fighting, wereforced to withdraw, having suffered 270 killed or wounded to 60 for theAmericans, who had to be restrained from pursuing the fleeing redcoats. It wasthe first occasion in the battle for New York in which the British Armyexperienced defeat. Although it was not a major battle—at its high point, about2,000 troops were engaged on each side—Harlem Heights had a significantpsychological impact on the morale of the Continental Army, which until then hadgood reason to doubt its ability to hold its own against Britishprofessionals.40 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts40]In his General Orders for the following day, Washington saw fit to underlinethat very point: “The Behavior of Yesterday was such a Contrast to that of someTroops before, as must show what may be done, when Officers & soldiers willexert themselves.” He had been searching for a way, as he put it, “to strikesome stroke” that would not only bolster the confidence of his troops but alsosend a signal to the American population as a whole that “The Cause” was aliveand well. The latter goal was reinforced by coverage in most Americannewspapers, which neglected to mention the Kip’s Bay disaster but featuredHarlem Heights as a glorious American victory and Thomas Knowlton as the newestAmerican martyr-hero. Though the strategic predicament facing the ContinentalArmy had not really changed, at least for the moment, the defeatist mood hadsubsided. It remained to be seen, however, whether the army could get off theisland.41 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts41]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 8[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]A LONG WAR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Give me leave to say, Sir, that your Affairs are in a more unpromising way thanyou seem to apprehend.—GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN HANCOCK, October 4, 1776--------------------------------------------------------------------------------One might have thought that the victory at Harlem Heights, small though it was,would serve as the stroke that Washington had been hoping to deliver. Havingscored that important point, he was now free to evacuate the Continental Armyoff Manhattan, honor intact, before General Howe could block his exit.But instead he ordered his troops to dig more trenches, in anticipation of amajor British assault from the south. He had finally found the ideal defensiveposition that perfectly embodied his entire strategic plan for defending NewYork, and he intended to use the rocky elevation at Harlem Heights to inflictmaximum casualties on the British Army before beating his retreat. It was a boldbut dangerous decision, since he was putting the survival of the ContinentalArmy at risk in order to deliver one more telling blow in behalf of “TheCause.”1 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts1]On the evening of September 20, as he scanned the sky to the south, looking forHowe’s approaching army, the horizon became ablaze from the fires consuming morethan one-third of New York City. The Continental Congress had given strictorders not to torch the city upon evacuation, reasoning that one day it would berecaptured—a palpable measure of the confidence still dominating thedeliberations in Philadelphia.2 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts2]What came to be called the “Great Fire” was probably the work of arsonists, mostlikely self-styled American patriots who were now a beleaguered minority in thecity. Two suspects were summarily dispatched, one thrown into the flames, theother hanged on a lamppost. Washington apprised Hancock that the fire was nothis doing and was probably an accident. But privately he confided to LundWashington that “Providence, or some good honest fellow, has done more for usthan we can do for ourselves.” Whatever the cause, for the remainder of the warthe occupying British Army lived among the ashes of all the homes, churches, andbuildings west of Broadway.3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts3]MEANWHILE, AS WASHINGTON awaited Howe’s frontal assault of Harlem Heights, whichnever materialized, the Continental Congress was attempting to digest the fullimplications of the Kip’s Bay disaster. Unlike the American populace as a whole,the delegates in Philadelphia were fully apprised of the humiliation.Caesar Rodney, for example, provided his fellow delegates from Delaware with afull narrative of the debacle, taking care to absolve Washington of anyresponsibility and casting blame on “the beardless boys” he commanded. “I havewrote on the Subject till I am in ill Humour,” Rodney concluded, “and the onlyComfort is that by the time you have read it you’ll be as Angry as I am.”William Hooper of South Carolina believed it was time to take off the patrioticblinders. “It becomes our duty to see things as they really are[,] divested ofall disguise,” he urged, “and when the happiness of the present age and Millionsyet unborn depends upon a reformation of them, we ought to spare no pains toeffect so desirable a purpose.” Washington, in fact, had been trying to tellHancock for several weeks that the Continental Congress did not seem to fathomthe deplorable condition of the army. After Kip’s Bay, the delegates finally gotthe message and voted to send a three-man committee to confer with Washingtonand his staff at Harlem Heights. They met for five days, from September 20 toSeptember 24.4 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts4]No record of the deliberations was kept, but the problems addressed andsolutions proposed were clearly outlined in the committee’s report to theContinental Congress two weeks later. The underlying conclusion was that theContinental Army was really not much of an army at all. To the extent that aquick victory was no longer tenable and that therefore success in the war forAmerican independence depended on a fighting force that could compete on equalterms with the British Army, there needed to be a “New Model” or “NewEstablishment.” In effect, the committee recommended all the reforms that thecongress had already tried and failed to implement a month earlier, this timewith a greater sense of urgency and comprehension.First, the Continental Army needed to expand to at least 60,000 troops, with amajority committed to serving “for the duration.” This would eliminate the needfor militia, since the New York campaign had demonstrated that dependence on“Minutemen” had proved to be one of those glorious presumptions that produceonly inglorious consequences. And one-year enlistments had proven equivalentlyproblematic, since the troops were scheduled to rotate out of the army just whenthey had begun to internalize the discipline of military service and becamereliable soldiers.Second, the organizational infrastructure of an effective army did not exist.The quartermaster corps, the commissary, and the hospital units were allfly-by-night improvisations. The troops were poorly clothed, poorly fed, andpoorly cared for if wounded or incapacitated by disease. The prevailingassumption that it was going to be a short war had allowed the Continental Armyto function in this ad hoc fashion. Now that the assumption had changed—it wasclearly going to be a protracted conflict—organizational reforms had to beinstitutionalized along lines modeled on the British Army, precisely whatWashington had been urging for months.Third, the officer corps at both the senior and the junior levels was woefullyinadequate. After-action reports on the collapse of discipline at GowanusHeights and Kip’s Bay placed the blame on inexperienced officers. Poorly ledtroops became mere gangs. On the other hand, when a natural leader like LordStirling or Thomas Knowlton was commanding, the troops fought well. NathanaelGreene even thought that, properly led, American troops were a match for Britishregulars. “If the officers were as good as the men,” Greene claimed, “Americamight bid defiance to the whole world.”5[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts5]The visiting committee endorsed all the reforms that Washington and his staffsuggested. The New York campaign had been a painful learning experience, so theonly sensible thing to do was to fix the glaring problems in order to make theContinental Army an effective fighting force worthy of its name. The problemswere clear, so the solutions were obvious—in fact, the solutions had beenbandied about in the congress for several weeks. Now, with greater resolve, thefull congress embraced all the recommendations for a “New Establishment” duringthe first week of October.6 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts6]But it was one thing to endorse the recommendations, another to implement them.Once again it became clear that the Continental Congress lacked the authority toenforce troop levies in the states, so the proposed enlargement of theContinental Army to 60,000 was a political, economic, and logisticalimpossibility, which in turn meant that Washington would remain dependent on themilitias for the foreseeable future. Even offering enhanced incentives forvolunteers who signed up “for the duration” made little appreciable difference.One-year enlistments remained the norm. Only a mandatory draft could have solvedthe problem, and that was out of the question. The manpower for a much enlargedContinental Army was undoubtedly available, and the political will to draw on itwas present in the Continental Congress, but that will did not extend to thestate legislatures, whose vision remained local rather than national.Moreover, the necessary organizational reform could not be effected merely bydrafting new procedural guidelines for the different branches of the army. Theregulations had to be enforced up and down the chain of command by men withlittle or no military experience, then internalized until routinized. This wasnot a natural act for the kind of men in the Continental Army. The truth wasthat a “New Establishment” could not be created overnight except on paper. Thefact that the war was going to be long meant that the army would have time, on atrial-and-error basis, to work out the all-important details. The ContinentalArmy, it would seem, was destined to be a permanent work in progress. And thatmore limited projection of a national army was all that could be justifiedwithin a republican framework.The recommendation for an improved officers corps caught John Adams’s attention,in part because it confirmed battlefield reports from New York, in part becausehe had been reading histories of the Roman army in order to educate himself ashead of the Board of War and Ordnance. He discovered that Polybius had concludedthat most Roman defeats were not the fault of troops but “always the Fault ofthe officers.” This same failure of leadership haunted the Continental Army, butAdams believed there was no swift cure for the problem: “The true Cause of thewant of good officers in the army is because … such officers in sufficientNumbers are not in America. Without Materials the best Workman can do nothing.Time, Study, and Experience alone must make a sufficient Number of officers.”7[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts7]What he meant was that America lacked the kind of British aristocracy thatencouraged military careers in the manner of the Howe brothers. And lacking sucha tradition, the Continental Army would have to manufacture officers therepublican way, by recognizing and promoting merit on the battlefield. (HenryKnox, Nathanael Greene, and the much-missed Thomas Knowlton were all excellentexamples of this slow but sure process, and a young artillery captain namedAlexander Hamilton was a looming discovery.) In the long run, America needed amilitary academy to produce competent officers, and Adams was prepared torecommend such an institution after the war was won. For now, however, demandvastly exceeded supply, and since there was no immediate solution, the very actof talking about the problem only advertised a congenital weakness in theContinental Army. “Concealing it is the way to cure it,” Adams concluded, “notpublishing it,” meaning that the unsolvable problem should be convenientlyobscured.8 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts8]As the summer turned to fall, then, two conclusions were clear: first, on allmatters related to the war effort, the Continental Congress continued tofunction as a provisional national government prepared to give Washingtoneverything he asked for; and second, while there was the will, there was no wayto translate that rhetorical support into reality, in part because the congresslacked authority over the state legislatures, in part because many of the illsaffecting the Continental Army had no immediate cure.Washington fully grasped this unpleasant but intractable reality. In a longletter to Hancock on October 4, he expressed his appreciation for theendorsement of all his recommendations by the visiting committee but added that“there is a natural difference between voting for Battalions and raising ofMen.” For the foreseeable future, he would command an army of unqualifiedofficers, wholly undependable militia, and short-term enlisted troops. As hisnewest aide, Tench Tilghman, put it, it would take a miracle to “stop the careerof Monsi Howe with the finest army that ever appeared in America,” whileWashington commanded “as bad a one as ever appeared in any part of the Globe.”9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts9]At bottom, Washington concluded, what was militarily essential was politicallyimpossible. Nothing less than a permanent standing army on the British modelcould win the war, but there was “such a distrust & jealousy of Military power,that the Commander in Chief has not an opportunity … to give the least assuranceof success.” To be sure, “The Cause” was glorious, but the Continental Army, ascurrently constituted, was an inherently problematic improvisation.10[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts10]Indeed, the deplorable situation was sufficiently obvious to his own troops thatsome deserters were already going over to the British Army. One British officer,Frederick MacKenzie, claimed that they were arriving at the rate of eighty aday. And as Washington predicted, loyalists from Long Island and lower Manhattanwere volunteering in company-size units to join Howe’s army. Meanwhile, over inNew Jersey, a civil war seemed to be brewing, as nearly three thousand citizens,including one signer of the Declaration of Independence, took up Lord Howe’soffer of amnesty and signed an oath of allegiance to George III.11[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts11]These defections could plausibly be regarded as the first cracks in the edificeof American independence and therefore as early indications that the Howestrategy was working. Several British officers expressed confusion when GeneralHowe let weeks pass without taking any action against Harlem Heights. Theypresumed, as Captain MacKenzie put it, that “the grand point in view iscertainly to beat and disperse this principal army, which, if once effected,little more will remain to be done.” But Howe, in fact, did not share thatpresumption. Having delivered a series of devastating blows to the ContinentalArmy, he was waiting for the aftershock to take effect. He felt no need todestroy the Continental Army, since he believed it was going to disintegrate onits own. And no less a witness than Washington himself feared that, as he hadtold Hancock, his army “is upon the eve of its political dissolution.”12[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts12]IN ORDER FOR the Howe strategy to succeed, the epidemic of fear anddisillusionment had to spread beyond New York and New Jersey. Pro-American presscoverage limited the contagion, but Washington worried that deserting troopswould carry the infection back to their respective states and the unattractivereality would begin to settle in; namely, that it was going to be a long war,and that the Continental Army as currently constituted was ill equipped to fightit.The leadership in the Continental Congress had demonstrated its wholeheartedsupport for Washington and provided a united front on the nonnegotiable statusof American independence. Even though they could not deliver on their promisesabout a “New Establishment,” the political gesture itself was important as astatement of commitment during this vulnerable moment. The delegates inPhiladelphia had to demonstrate that they were immune to the infection.Adams, for example, used his position as head of the Board of War and Ordnanceto reassure officers who were having doubts about the dispirited condition ofthe Continental Army. “I am extremely sorry to learn that the troops have beendisheartened,” he wrote to one officer. “But the despondency of spirit was thenatural Effect of the Retreats you have made one after the other.” After thedefeats on Long Island and at Kip’s Bay, Adams observed, “the finest Army in theworld would have been seized, in similar circumstances, with more or less of aPanick. But your Men will soon recover their Spirits in a short Time.”13[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts13]Franklin took a different tack, preferring in his ever-agile way to use thedeplorable condition of the Continental Army as leverage to extract money andsupplies from the French. In his instructions to Silas Deane, the new Americanminister to France, he urged complete candor about the sad state of the army:“Upon the whole our Army near New York are not sufficiently strong to Cope withGeneral Howe in the open Field.… They want better Arms, better Tents and moreClothing than they now have, or is in our power now to Supply them with,consequently we cannot recruit or increase that Army under thesediscouragements.” Nothing less than immediate French assistance could save theday.14 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts14]Among several delegates, at yet another, somewhat deeper level, the need toimmunize themselves from doubt prompted a variety of ingenious and oftencounterintuitive arguments, all designed to serve as flying buttresses thatreinforced the interior architecture of their revolutionary confidence. LikeThomas Aquinas’s five proofs of God’s existence, these were rational attempts tojustify a belief that ultimately rested on faith, which in this case was theconviction that the military defeats in New York were meaningless because theAmerican cause was destiny’s child.Benjamin Rush, who would later be celebrated as the founder of Americanpsychiatry, told his wife that the recent British victories were, in truth, agodsend. “I think we stood in need of a frown from heaven,” he wrote. “It is,you know, through difficulties & trials that states as well as individuals aretrained up to glory & happiness. My faith is now stronger than ever.” Indeed,Rush claimed that “for a long time I not only expected, but wished that GeneralHowe might gain possession of New York.” For now all the loyalists from adjacentstates would flee to New York, “where they will ripen as the Tories of Bostondid for banishment & destruction.” The rest of the country would then “be purgedof those rascals whose idleness or perfidy have brought most of our calamitiesupon us.” All of America’s rotten eggs would now be gathered into one basket.15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts15]William Williams, a delegate from Connecticut, took a more theological route toreach a similar conclusion. His preferred interpretive framework was the Puritanjeremiad, which transformed the British victories on Long Island and Kip’s Bayinto acts of divine retribution for a sinful American people. “God has bluntedthe weapons of our warfare,” Williams intoned, “and made us flee before ourEnemies, and given them possession of our strongholds.” In Williams’s moraluniverse, the issue was not the relative weakness of the Continental Army butthe depravity of the entire American population: “A thorough Repentance &Reformation … will appease the Anger of a holy & just God, avert these amazingCalamities, secure Liberty & Happiness to this and all succeeding Ages & eternalFelicity & Glory to all the Subjects of it.” The obvious solution was not betterofficers, better equipment, or aid from France. All those items would beforthcoming after American patriots fasted, did penance, and prayed for theirprovidential redemption.16 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts16]Adams discovered assurance in Greek and Roman history, chiefly the lessonslearned in the Peloponnesian and Punic wars. When Henry Knox expressed concernabout the impact of the series of defeats on the morale of the Continental Army,Adams told him to stop worrying: “It is very true that a Silly Panic has beenspread in your Army, and from there come to Philadelphia.” But Hannibal hadinflicted an equivalent panic on the Roman army yet could never manage to takeadvantage of it and eventually lost the war. Howe was likely to prove theHannibal of the American Revolution.17[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts17]For, like Hannibal, Howe would discover that winning battles was not synonymouswith winning wars: “Conquests were easily made, because We atchieve them withour whole force—they are retained with difficulty because We defend them withonly a part of our forces.” In Howe’s case, the occupation of Long Island andManhattan would stretch his resources to the breaking point. “After such adivision and distribution of his forces,” Adams predicted, “I think he hasnearly reached the end of his tether for this Year.” The greater Howe’svictories, the greater his difficulties. Howe was destined to win his way todefeat.18 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts18]Moreover, Adams explained, the Americans had the example of Thebes in thePeloponnesian War to guide them. After some initial defeats akin to the Americanlosses in New York, the Thebans realized that they could not win a conventionalwar against Sparta and adopted a defensive strategy that rendered it “rash tohazard a decisive Battle against the best troops in Greece.” Instead, they chose“to harass the Spartans with frequent Skirmishes … whilst they gainedExperience, Confidence, and Courage by daily Encounters.” The humiliations inNew York were really a marvelous learning experience that taught the Americansthe lessons the Thebans had learned two thousand years before. For the British,like the Spartans, had to win the war. And the Americans, like the Thebans, hadonly not to lose it. That seminal insight had been learned the hard way in NewYork but would now guide the American side to ultimate victory.19[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts19]The Adams analysis would prove prescient as the war dragged on, though it wouldtake a herculean effort on Washington’s part to embrace a defensive, or Theban,strategy, partly because of his own aggressive instincts, partly because he wasworried that superior British financial resources would win out in a protractedwar. But in the crucible of that moment, what stands out is the multiplearguments the leading members of the Continental Congress were able to constructin order to dismiss the military disasters at New York. Whether it wasdemographically, divinely, or historically sanctioned, they regarded the fate ofAmerican independence as foreordained. Even if the specific arguments werespecious, the underlying faith on which they rested was unshakable. The Howeshad badly miscalculated the depth of that faith.BY EARLY OCTOBER, Washington had come to the realization that General Howe wasnot going to take him up on his invitation to attack the fortress at HarlemHeights. About the same time, Howe was coming to the realization that thecampaign season was drawing to a close and that he needed to stage anotherevocative demonstration of British military supremacy—in effect, to deliveranother shock to the dazed and dwindling Continental Army.Howe’s tactic of choice was almost always a flanking movement, so afterconsulting his brother about navigation options and obstacles in the East River,he chose to launch an invasion at Throg’s Neck (also called Frog’s Neck), ninemiles northeast of Harlem Heights, near present-day Fort Schuyler in the Bronx.In keeping with his measured strategy, Howe’s objective was not to blockWashington’s escape from Manhattan but, just the opposite, to threatenencirclement in order to force the Continental Army to evacuate the island, thenfight an open-field battle in which the superiority of the British Army wouldonce again prove decisive. As he later put it to Germain, his goal was not totrap Washington on Manhattan but to draw him out of his Harlem Heights fortress“and if possible to bring him to action.”20[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts20]The movement of British ships and men up the East River immediately caughtWashington’s attention. “I have reason to believe,” he wrote Hancock on October11, “that the greatest part of their Army has moved upward, or is about to doit, pursuing their original plan of getting in our rear & cutting off ourcommunications with the Country.” Washington plausibly presumed that Howeintended to seal the trap, when in fact he intended to open the door.21[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts21]Washington conducted a personal survey of the shoreline northeast of Manhattan,including the terrain at Throg’s Neck. It revealed that the isthmus was reallyan island at high tide, connected to the mainland by a causeway and bridge. Heordered an undersize regiment of Pennsylvania Continentals to block thisprospective landing spot. Under the command of Colonel Edward Hand, the exit offthe island was destroyed, and when the advance wave of 4,000 British troopsunder Henry Clinton landed on October 12, they found themselves marooned in amosquito-infested swamp. Throg’s Neck, it turned out, was the worst possibleplace to launch an invasion.22 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts22]Events then moved at lightning speed on both sides. Washington convened acouncil of war on October 16 that voted almost unanimously—there was onedissenter—to evacuate Manhattan and move the army eighteen miles to the highground of White Plains, which would provide a natural defensive refuge akin toHarlem Heights. The goal was to get there before Howe blocked the route.The council of war also voted to leave 2,000 troops at Fort Washington. Thismade no strategic sense, since leaving “a castle in the rear” violated everyconventional principle of warfare and since it was already abundantly clear thatBritish warships could sail up the Hudson past Fort Washington with impunity,which undermined the core mission of the garrison. But the commitment madeperfect sense psychologically, as a statement of American resolve to defend NewYork, even as Washington was ordering an evacuation. It was simultaneously anindefensible military decision, a heartfelt act of honor, and Washington’s worsttactical blunder of the entire war.23[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts23]Present for the council of war was none other than Charles Lee, recently arrivedfrom his victorious campaign in South Carolina. Despite his irreverent anderratic mannerisms, his beaked nose, disheveled appearance, and ever-presentpack of dogs, Lee was second-in-command only to Washington. His presencebolstered the confidence of several officers, including Joseph Reed, who hadbeen murmuring about Washington’s apparent confusion and indecisiveness eversince the brilliant escape from Long Island.One can detect the early symptoms of rivalry between the two commanders, mostglaringly when Lee suggested that Washington offer his resignation to theContinental Congress for the recent failures on the battlefield, an offerallegedly designed to extract a vote of confidence from his civilian superiors.Washington ignored the suggestion; further, he did not interpret Lee’s advice asa hostile act. Indeed, he renamed Fort Constitution, on the New Jersey side ofthe Hudson, Fort Lee to commemorate Lee’s return. And the decision to evacuateManhattan was an implicit endorsement of Lee’s judgment, since he had alwaysthought that New York was indefensible.24[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts24]On October 18, the same day that the Continental Army began its evacuation, theHowe brothers transported Clinton’s troops off Throg’s Neck, added two regimentsof recently arrived Hessians to the invasion force, and landed at Pell’s Point,a few miles up Long Island Sound in present-day Pelham. The complicatedamphibious maneuvers went like clockwork, the landing site was on the mainlandrather than on a quasi-island, and the landing was initially unopposed.But unluckily for the Howes, they had chosen a location that was guarded by JohnGlover and his Marblehead regiment, perhaps the most disciplined troops in theContinental Army. Glover later remembered looking through his telescope andseeing two hundred British ships approaching his position: “Oh! The anxiety ofmind I was in then for the fate of the day.… I would have given a thousandworlds to have had General Lee … present to direct or at least approve what Ihad done.”25 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts25]Acting on his own initiative, Glover moved his 750 men into position behind aseries of stone walls and, though outnumbered more than five to one, invited anattack. As the British advanced, one row of Glover’s troops rose up to fire,then retreated, and as the British charged forward with bayonets at the ready,the next row rose up to deliver another withering salvo, and so on from wall towall. In a little more than a hour, the British lost more men at Pell’s Pointthan they had in the entire Long Island campaign. (Glover later claimed that hismen remained as calm throughout the engagement “as if shooting ducks.”) By oneestimate, the British suffered over 300 dead and wounded, the Americans only20.26 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts26]Howe was sufficiently stunned by the unexpected fighting prowess of Americantroops to order a halt in the British advance. The next day he moved cautiouslyinland toward New Rochelle, where he decided to wait for 8,000 newly arrivedHessians to come up from Long Island. Glover’s troops had, in fact, retreated tojoin Washington’s army, so there were only a handful of militia to contestHowe’s march toward White Plains. But Howe did not move.The Continental Army did move, though ever so slowly, advancing less than threemiles a day. Fully a quarter of the 13,000 troops were sick or wounded; therewere not enough horses to pull the wagons and cannons, which had to be hauled byhand; and food supplies were nonexistent, forcing troops to scavenge whateverthey could find along the route. Joseph Plumb Martin remembered, with irony,that he was required to carry an iron cooking kettle, which was never usedbecause there was nothing to cook. The troops were in no condition to fight, butthat was not necessary, because Howe made no effort to block their path. It wasalmost as if he wished them to escape.27[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts27][images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_003_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Whatever Howe’s motives, the final stragglers in the Continental Army reachedthe safety of the hills at White Plains on October 24, at last out of the trap.The strategic decision to defend New York had always been a fundamental mistakethat created the potential for an American catastrophe; now, thanks to thediplomatic priorities of the Howes, it had been averted. True to form, WilliamHowe waited four more days to launch an attack on White Plains, enough time forWashington to prepare his defenses.IT WAS THE END of the beginning for the American side, meaning that its army hadmanaged to survive what proved to be the most vulnerable moment of the war.Washington, from lessons learned at New York, would never again allow thesurvival of the Continental Army to be put at risk. Though it ran counter to allhis instincts, he now realized that his goal was not to win the war but rathernot to lose it.It was the beginning of the end for the British side, meaning that the Howebrothers, despite their tactical brilliance, had failed to deliver the decisiveblow that killed the rebellion at its moment of birth. Indeed, they haddeliberately decided not to do so. What might have happened if they had actedotherwise will always remain one of the most intriguing and unanswerablequestions in American history.But several other intriguing questions had, in fact, been answered duringAmerica’s revolutionary summer, and the answers largely defined the parametersof the war that would ensue. They cut in two different directions, one makingthe prospects for a British victory remote in the extreme, the other making anyoutright American military triumph equally unlikely. Taken together, theydefined the terms of the protracted conflict that would play out over the nextfive years and end with the British decision after Yorktown that the war wasunwinnable.On the one hand, it was now clear that the Continental Congress was immune toany British proposal for reconciliation. Commitment to “The Cause” was creedalin character, impervious to the calamities on Long Island and Manhattan, whichwere dismissed as temporary setbacks and then folded into the providential senseof American independence. This was not a wholly rational mentality, for it ruledas inadmissible any evidence that challenged that core conviction. It turned outthat Jefferson’s lyrical rendering of the revolutionary pledge—“our lives, ourfutures, and our sacred honor”—was much more than a rhetorical gesture. Itaccurately reflected the bottomless level of commitment in the ContinentalCongress, which had now been tested to the limit and never wavered. The centralassumption on which the Howes had based their military strategy, namely thatsupport for the rebellion was soft and shallow, was exposed as misguided.Whatever subsequent disappointments and disasters might befall “The Cause” outthere in the vast American theater, the center would always hold.On the other hand, it was equally clear that the consensus on independence didnot translate into a consensus on American union. And because local, state, andregional allegiances remained supreme, all prospects for a fully empoweredContinental Army were impossible. Americans regarded both a national governmentand a potent Continental Army as embodiments of consolidated political andmilitary power that ran against the grain of the very values the AmericanRevolution claimed to stand for.This, in turn, meant that the Continental Army would forever remain a kind ofawkward orphan, indispensable but suspect, always on the verge of dissolution.Its persistence was obviously essential, but its marginal status constituted amore essential statement about the hostility toward standing armies in thefledging American republic. There was no way that such an army could win thewar.Taken together, these two products of the revolutionary summer virtually ensureda long conflict that the British could not win for political reasons and theAmericans could not win for military reasons. Many fateful decisions andchallenges remained ahead—Washington’s inspired bravado at Trenton, Howe’sbizarre decision to capture Philadelphia rather than seal the Hudson corridor,the endurance test at Valley Forge, the crucial French entry into the war—butthey all played out within the strategic framework created in the summer of1776."},{"pageContent":"[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg] 9[images/Elli_9780385349628_epub_L01_r1.jpg]POSTSCRIPT: NECESSARY FICTIONSThe ink on the Treaty of Paris (1783) was barely dry when Washington predictedthat the true story of the improbable American victory would never get into thehistory books:If Historiographers should be hardy enough to fill the pages of History with theadvantages that have been gained with unequal numbers (on the part of America)in the course of this contest, and attempt to relate the distressingcircumstances under which they have been obtained, it is more than probable thatposterity will bestow on their labors the epithet and marks of fiction; for itwill not be believed that such a force as Great Britain has employed for eightyears in this Country could be baffled … by numbers infinitely less, composed ofmen oftentimes half starved, always in Rags, without pay, and experiencing, attimes, every species of distress which human nature is capable of undergoing.1[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts1]Washington was calling attention to the persistence of the Continental Army—theembodiment of “The Cause” for eight long years—as the essential ingredient inthe ultimate American triumph. As Henry Clinton had realized from the start butthe Howe brothers had not, the strategic center of the rebellion was not aplace—not New York, not Philadelphia, not the Hudson corridor—but theContinental Army itself.Within this narrative framework, the New York campaign of 1776 loomed large, forthis was the most vulnerable moment, when the Continental Army nearly ceased toexist. Indeed, a history of the war from the perspective that survival was thekey to success featured the near-miraculous escape across the East River inAugust 1776 and the endurance of the Continental Army at Valley Forge in thewinter of 1777, even more than the dramatic victories at Saratoga and Yorktown,as the decisive events.Washington’s own cast of mind about the course of the conflict assumed aprovidential character based on recollections of the summer of ’76. For herealized, more than most, that the decision to defend New York had been amonumental blunder, rescued from catastrophe only by some combination of sheerluck and the inexplicable reticence of the Howes. This was what he meant when hedescribed the American victory as “a standing miracle” that came about becauseof “a concatenation of causes, which in all probability at no time, or under anycircumstances, will combine again.” Though Washington was not a deeply religiousman, the early months of the war made him a believer in providence, which meantthat on some occasions the gods took matters into their own hands.2[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts2]He was convinced throughout the remainder of the war that New York was thedivinely ordained place where he would return to redeem his earlier mistakes anddeliver the decisive blow that ended all pretensions of the British Empire inNorth America. He was obsessed with New York as the place where the climacticbattle would occur, because New York was the place where “The Cause” had nearlydied, so it stood to reason it should be the place where it would ultimatelytriumph. He was completely surprised when the fates, and the French fleet, chosean obscure location on the Tidewater peninsula instead.His description of the Continental Army—“half starved, always in Rags, withoutpay”—was intended as a tribute to the long-suffering troops who had stayed thecourse. But it was also a caustic comment on a political pattern that had firstcongealed in the summer of ’76, and then only deepened and darkened over theensuing years of the war: namely, that the Continental Army was kept on lifesupport but was never provided the money and men Washington requested, eventhough the resources for a larger and better-equipped army were readilyavailable.3 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts3]From the start, as we have seen, the respective states preferred to support themanpower needs of their own militias rather than meet the allocationsrecommended by the congress for the Continental Army, primarily because localand state allegiances outweighed any collective or national ethos. As the wardragged on, these centrifugal forces only accelerated, and each request formoney and men was more deeply resented by the state legislatures. Nor was itmerely a matter of state versus national loyalty. The very idea of a robustContinental Army was generally regarded as an American version of the BritishArmy, which had the menacing look of a domestic leviathan that threatened therepublican principles that the war was purportedly being fought to defend. Inthat sense, Washington’s interpretation of the American victory focusedattention on the gritty and stubborn persistence of an institution that amajority of Americans regarded as somewhat embarrassing.The urge to airbrush the Continental Army out of the patriotic picture becamepalpable when the matter of pensions came up in the wake of the Treaty of Paris.A promise had been made during the course of the war, chiefly for recruitmentpurposes, to include pensions of half pay for life for officers. As it becameincreasingly clear that this promise was not going to be kept because the stateswould refuse to raise the taxes to fund it, an alternative proposal called“commutation” was put forward, whereby retired officers would receive full payfor five years.4 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts4]The popular response to the commutation scheme, most especially in letters andeditorials in the New England press, was overwhelmingly negative, verging onscatological. Veteran officers were described as indolent nobodies, flushed withtheir sense of significance, feeding at the public trough like “ravenous harpieswith whetted beaks and piercing eyes.” If they were truly virtuous men, as theyclaimed, then virtue should suffice as their only reward. One retiredConnecticut officer complained that reports of his pension made him a pariahamong his neighbors: “I became obnoxious to the mass of people.… When I had anysevere sickness they hoped I would die. One noisy man said he hoped I would dieand they would take my skin for a drum head to drum other officers out oftown.”5 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts5]The antiveteran sentiment then coalesced around the creation of a fraternalorganization of retired officers called the Society of the Cincinnati, whichseemed to embody all the values ordinary Americans loathed. Henry Knox had beenthe main proponent for the preservation of the “band of brothers” who hadsuffered and sacrificed together to win American independence. But once itbecame known that membership in the society was hereditary on the male side ofthe family line, it was stigmatized as an aristocratic institution thatthreatened republican values. The widespread hostility to the Society of theCincinnati stunned Washington, who regarded it as an abiding reminder of thecountless personal sacrifices that had made American independence possible. Butas it turned out, the crucial role of the Continental Army was just about thelast thing most Americans wished to remember.6[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts6]FIRSTHAND MEMORIES HAD nearly evaporated by the time Joseph Plumb Martin gotaround to publishing his memoirs in 1830. Writing from his farm in Maine when hewas seventy years old, Martin recalled his first experience of combat on LongIsland and Manhattan as a fifteen-year-old boy brimming over with patrioticconfidence, wholly bereft of military experience, the poster child for an armyof amateurs. His major theme echoed Washington’s emphasis on sheer persistence,his own and the Continental Army’s capacity to survive despite hardships thatsubsequent generations could not possibly comprehend and apparently preferred toforget.7 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts7]There was nothing glorious about the episodes in Martin’s account, which focusedon the mundane, day-by-day challenges of staying alive that often took the formof finding food to eat. He made no effort to assess the larger strategicimplications of the battles on Long Island and Manhattan, since his vantagepoint, like the shallow ditch at Kip’s Bay, hardly afforded a panoramicperspective. But in his own unassuming way, Martin provided what we might call aTolstoyan view of war, meaning a recovery of the authentic emotional experienceof an ordinary soldier. In the end, his message was simple but profound: both heand the Continental Army had been survivors, and that was how the war was won,or perhaps not lost.By the time he wrote, the enforced amnesia about the essential role of theContinental Army had established itself as received wisdom, and what Martincalled “the myth of the militia” had emerged in the folklore to explain theimprobable American victory, which was allegedly won by “Minutemen” rather thanregulars like Martin. As one of the few veterans of the Continental Army stillalive, he felt a special obligation to challenge this misguided version ofhistory:It has been said by some … that the Revolutionary army was needless; that theMilitia were competent for all that the crisis required.… But I still insistthat they would not have answered the end so well as regular soldiers, who werethere, and there obliged to be … and could not go away when we pleased withoutexposing ourselves to military punishment.8[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts8]Americans needed to believe that they had enjoyed an Immaculate Conception, thatthey had given birth to an independent American republic without resorting to astanding army of regular soldiers. Martin’s memoir was a poignant plea for theregulars like him who had been written out of the patriotic script because theydid not fit the republican stereotype of the citizen-soldier. Washington hadwarned from the start that the story of America’s successful war forindependence might have the look of fiction, but he had no way of knowing thatthe fictional version would portray the militia as the stars of the story.EXPLAINING A DEFEAT is always a more difficult assignment than explaining avictory. But the publication of the Treaty of Paris created an impossibledilemma for Great Britain, since its terms revealed that the British Empire inNorth America was lost forever. All the blood and treasure—40,000 casualties and50 million pounds—had been for nothing. As the improbability and totality of thedefeat sank in, a collective silence settled like a cloud over the subject, asif it were an unwelcome guest at a dinner party that, if ignored, wouldeventually go away. John Adams, who had the misfortune to serve as America’sfirst minister to the Court of St. James’s in 1785, reported that members of theBritish court averted their eyes whenever he entered the room, since he was sucha painful reminder of an unattractive reality they preferred to deny. Abigailclaimed that vast sectors of the London press, influenced by the delusionalstories of the loyalists-in-exile, were reporting that a majority of Americanswere having second thoughts about independence, and that Benjamin Franklin, uponhis return from Paris, had nearly been stoned to death by Philadelphia artisansangry with him for leading them astray.9[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts9]Denial was vastly preferable to a candid appraisal of the debacle, for thatwould have required the British government to face some extremely unpleasantfacts that, taken together, undermined the core presumption on which the entireBritish imperial agenda rested. For the unattractive truth was that severalBritish ministries, starting in 1763, had badly miscalculated the depth andrange of American opposition to the extension of Parliament’s authority over thecolonies. These ministries had arrogantly assumed that the imposition of Britishmilitary power in 1774 would coerce the colonists into submission. They hadconsistently misread the level of resistance within the American population. Andthey had incorrectly presumed that the superiority of British arms would producea quick end to the rebellion in 1776.On all counts, history had proven them wrong. The American colonists hadprovided them with multiple opportunities to alter their course, on severaloccasions offering glimpses of a reconfigured British Empire based on theprinciple of shared sovereignty and mutual consent. The British had rejected allsuch suggestions, on the constitutional ground that sovereignty was indivisibleand must reside in one place, which was Parliament, but also for deeperpsychological reasons rooted in the need to ensure control over their colonialsubjects. This imperious conviction was, they believed, the nonnegotiableprinciple that defined an empire. It transcended political and constitutionalniceties and came down to an entrenched sense of superiority that rendered theirAmerican cousins as inferior creatures. But the resulting war had demonstratedquite conclusively that the British could not control the outcome; their senseof superiority was an illusion. It is probably apocryphal, but it madehistorical sense that the defeated British army that marched out of Yorktownplayed “The World Turned Upside Down.”An alternative narrative had begun to cushion the pain of defeat even before thefull implications of that defeat were felt. In the spring of 1779, from lateMarch to late June, the House of Commons put itself into committee-of-the-wholeformat in order to debate what it called “The Conduct of the American War.” Thishighly unusual inquiry had been requested by William Howe, recently recalledfrom America, now to be addressed as Sir William, the knighthood a reward forhis services as commander of His Majesty’s troops in the American theater. Butdespite the honorific title, upon his return Howe had encountered widespreadcriticism of his conduct of the war in the London press, essentially accusinghim of making military decisions almost designed to protract rather than end therebellion. Howe used his status as a member of Parliament to request, in lieu ofa trial or court-martial, a special session of the House of Commons to answerhis critics and clear his name.10 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts10]In response to those critics who accused him of excessive caution throughout theNew York campaign, Howe offered a blanket explanation: “The most essential dutyI had to observe was not wanting to commit his Majesty’s troops where the objectwas inadequate. I knew fully well that any considerable loss sustained by thearmy could not speedily or easily be repaired.” Howe did not acknowledge that heand his brother had had aspirations as diplomats, and were hopeful ofnegotiating a peaceful end to the conflict. He took refuge, instead, in hisjudgment as an officer in the British Army who, in fact, had achieved his statedobjective of capturing the city and port of New York with a minimum of Britishcasualties.11 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts11]His most ardent critics had focused their fire on his failure to follow up hisvictory on Long Island by attacking the fleeing American troops on BrooklynHeights, which might very well have resulted in the surrender of the entireContinental Army. Howe acknowledged that the blood of his troops had been up andthat, if allowed, they could have taken the forts on Brooklyn Heights. But heinsisted that such a victory would have come at the cost of massive Britishcasualties, which he judged to be unnecessary. He had no way of knowing thatWashington would find a way to evacuate his defeated army across the East River,a quite miraculous extraction that defied all the conventional tactics of modernwarfare. His critics, he implied, were second-guessing a battlefield decisionthat had been made for sound tactical reasons in the crucible of the moment—thatis, without the benefit of their hindsight wisdom.12[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts12]Thus far Howe’s defense rested on his narrow definition of the accusations madeagainst him, justifying his tactical caution in several actions on Long Islandand Manhattan on strictly military grounds that civilians and politicians lackedthe competence to criticize. But the argument expanded exponentially whenseveral British officers were called to testify on Howe’s behalf. They confirmedhis claim that his decision to delay a frontal assault on the forts on BrooklynHeights had been tactically correct, indeed that such an attack would have been“an act of desperate rashness.” But then they went on to describe the largerstrategic dilemma that Howe had faced:That the force sent to America was at no time equal to the subjugations of thecountry—That this proceeded from the general enmity and hostility of the people,who were almost unanimous in their aversion to the government of Great Britain;and also from the nature of the country, which was most difficult andimpracticable with respect to military operations than could possibly beconceived…, which rendered it impossible for the army to carry on its operationsat any distance from the fleet.13 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts13]This testimony caught the immediate attention of two prominent critics of thewar, Charles Fox and Edmund Burke, good Whigs who from the start had opposed thecoercive policy of George III and his ministers that culminated in Germain’sdecision to invade New York in the summer of 1776. Fox was particularlyoutspoken in defending Howe, who was being made a scapegoat, he claimed, inorder to deflect criticism from the real culprits in the British government: “Wehave lost 25,000 men. We have spent upwards of 30 million [pounds] by thisaccursed American war. Who has been the cause of this miscarriage? Is that notthe question? Who led us into this war?” Since blaming the king would haveverged on treason and violated the unspoken code of conduct for debates inParliament, Fox fixed his sight on a safer target. It was not Howe who was ontrial but Germain. Burke chimed in with his expression of profuse thanks toHowe, an honorable officer, who had had the misfortune to be appointed commanderin chief in a war that was both unnecessary and unwinnable.14[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts14]No one, including Howe, had anticipated this turn of events, and even thosemembers of the House who harbored serious doubts about his management of HisMajesty’s troops now called for an end to the deliberations, which had become afreewheeling critique of the British government. But Howe insisted on continuingthe proceedings, arguing that nothing less than his reputation was at stake, andhe did not yet feel fully vindicated. Fox, who was having a field day at theexpense of Germain’s reputation, heartily concurred that, by all means, thedebate should continue, for Sir William had become the agent for the emergenceof truth in the House of Commons after years of obfuscation and denial.Germain had said nothing up to this point, but he now felt obliged to respond tothose criticizing his conduct of the war. He was at pains to express his abidingrespect for Howe and his deep disapproval of the way Sir William’s reputationhad been bandied about by “runners and whisperers, and coffee housepoliticians.” But he was also resolute in his conviction that he had providedthe Howe brothers with overwhelming military superiority. He had no doubts orsecond thoughts about this: “The force sent out from this country was fullycompetent to the attainment of its objective, by the total reduction of therebellion and the consequent recovery of the colonies.” Germain did not say itoutright, but the clear implication of his remarks was that for whatever reason,the Howes had failed to accomplish their mission.15[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts15]He was especially distressed to hear Howe and other British officersmisrepresent the level of popular support for the rebellion as “almostunanimous.” His own sources, mostly loyalists-in-exile, assured him that onlybetween one-fourth and one-third of the colonists were committed rebels; therest were either loyalists or neutrals. To document his case, Germain presentedevidence that there were “more Americans regimented in our service than were tobe found under the rebel commander in chief.” He also cited the recruitmentproblems afflicting the Continental Army, “which wanted 60,000 but had neverbeen able to muster more than 20,000 in one army.”16[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts16]Howe requested the opportunity to contest Germain’s figures but was blocked whenthe House voted to end the proceedings on June 29. It is clear in retrospectthat Germain’s estimate of loyalist sentiment was vastly inflated. We now knowthat approximately 20 percent of the American populace was loyalist, but theclaim of Howe’s supporters that almost the entire American population embracedthe rebellion was also an exaggeration.From Howe’s point of view, the results of the inquiry were equivocal. On the onehand, his critics had been answered, and no one had suggested that he bestripped of his knighthood or receive any official reprimand. On the other hand,his conduct had become a political prize in a larger argument about the wisdomand winnability of the war. And his defenders had rallied behind him on thegrounds that he had been given an impossible mission that no display of militarycompetence could have overcome. For long-standing opponents of the war inParliament, he was a victim. For supporters of an imperial agenda toward theAmerican colonies, he was the convenient one-word answer to the awkwardquestion: How could we possibly have lost the war?WHAT WE MIGHT CALL the Howe interpretation of the British defeat never receivedofficial status. For that matter, the British government never saw fit toconduct an official inquiry into the reasons for the rather monumental debacle,preferring instead to draw a curtain of silence around the entire episode,treating it like a wound that would heal itself over time.One exception to this policy of enforced amnesia was Henry Clinton, who saw fitto begin writing his own memoirs soon after returning from America in 1782.Clinton had inherited command of the British Army from Howe in 1778, so hisprimary motive was to justify his own decisions during the latter stages of thewar, arguing that once the French entered the conflict, he faced insuperableobstacles and that the surrender of Cornwallis’s army at Yorktown was not hisfault. But in the early pages of his memoir, Clinton went back to the New Yorkcampaign and, after bowing to Howe’s status as commander in chief, proceeded totell a story that insinuated that Howe had missed a golden opportunity to winthe war at its very inception.17 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts17]Clinton described three occasions when Howe had rejected his advice. Claimingthat he was motivated “by no other principle than to contribute my utmost towardthe speedy extinction of the rebellion,” he had initially proposed an attack onthe northern tip of Manhattan, which would have sealed the Continental Army onthe New York archipelago without hope of escape. He had also argued for pursuingthe Continentals at Brooklyn Heights, when they had still been reeling from thedefeat on Gowanus Heights. And he had recommended an assault at King’s Bridgerather than Kip’s Bay, which would have trapped the Continental Army onManhattan. In each instance, Howe had rejected his advice, and although Clintonwent out of his way to defend Howe’s authority as commander in chief, henevertheless created the distinct impression that the Continental Army couldhave been destroyed several times over in the New York campaign, and if that hadhappened, the war might very well have ended then and there.18[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts18]Clinton’s memoirs probably reflected the critical appraisal of Howe’s decisionswithin certain segments of the officer corps of the British Army, but they hadno impact on the ongoing if surreptitious debate about who to blame for theBritish defeat, because Clinton died before completing them, and they were notpublished until the middle of the twentieth century. It does seem clear,however, that Clinton went to his maker believing that the American war forindependence might very well have ended differently if he, rather than Howe, hadbeen in command in New York.Clinton’s account was obviously self-serving, but it was reinforced by the firstcomprehensive history of the war from the British side, published in two volumesin 1794. Its author was Charles Stedman, a British staff officer throughout thewar who wanted to strike an upbeat note despite the British defeat. “Althoughthe issue of the war was unfortunate,” Stedman explained, “neither martial ardorwas wanting, among our countrymen, nor patriotic zeal.” Stedman’s main argumentwas that the British Army had done its duty, fought bravely, and should notsuffer criticisms or blame for the eventual outcome of the war.19[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts19]The only exception was William Howe. Stedman’s account of the New York campaignfollowed the same line as Clinton’s critique, describing Howe’s decisions onLong Island and Manhattan as “inexplicable.” Since Stedman had served on RichardHowe’s staff, he was surely aware that the military decisions of both Howebrothers were considerably influenced by their hopes for a peacefulreconciliation, but he did not mention that fact, preferring instead tocharacterize Howe’s decisions as “tactical blunders.” He was especially criticalof Howe’s failure to pursue Washington’s depleted troops as they retreatedthrough New Jersey in November 1776, citing that as the final and most opportuneoccasion to destroy the Continental Army.20[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts20]According to Stedman’s account, once that vulnerable moment passed, thelikelihood of a British victory diminished for three reasons: first, Washingtonadopted a more defensive strategy, what was called “a war of posts,” that madedecisive engagement highly improbable; second, the Continental Army got betterwith experience, especially in the development of a more professional officercorps; and third, the Franco-American treaty of 1778 threw money and men intothe American side. Taken together, these developments made the war unwinnablefor the British, despite heroic efforts by the army and navy.21[Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts21]Stedman’s version of history provided an attractive story line for both theBritish government and the British Army, as it contradicted the claim ofopposition leaders like Burke, Fox, and Pitt that the war had been, from thestart, a misguided venture. But it had to be won quickly, with one smashingblow, which was precisely what Germain had proposed and orchestrated in thesummer of 1776. When that effort failed, the British military had performedheroically in support of what had become a lost cause.The beauty of this interpretation was that it sidestepped the question ofwhether the policies of the British ministry that had caused the war weresensible, which they clearly were not, and it located the source of the Britishfailure in one discreet moment, the summer of 1776, and one British officer,William Howe, who missed the chance to destroy the Continental Army. This meantthat fundamental questions about the core assumptions underlying Britain’simperial agenda need not be raised. It assumed that if the Howes had acted moreaggressively, the Continental Army would have ceased to exist, which is almostcertainly correct, but also that the destruction of the Continental Army wouldhave ended the war. While we can never know for sure, the balance of historicalscholarship over the last forty years has made that a highly problematicassumption.22 [Elli_9780385349628_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts22]"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe chronological terrain over which this story moves is highly contestedground, littered with the dead bodies of historians who have preceded me.

Jeffrey Ward did a masterful job of making the maps both depictthe battles and fit the text.Ike Williams, my agent, handled all the contractual niceties, made sure thepeople at Knopf were paying attention, and routinely brought me back from theeighteenth century with gossip about the Celtics, Patriots, and Red Sox.Linda Chesky Fernandes, my assistant, did not do any of the research, but shedid just about everything else, to include deciphering my scrawl, compensatingfor my technological incompetence, balancing my mood swings, and kissing me onthe cheek.My wife, Ellen Wilkins Ellis, did not edit my writing, but she did edit mypsyche. I have a strong suspicion that this made a huge difference.Most of the writing was done in longhand in my study at Amherst, surrounded by afeisty Jack Russell terrier, an earnest Labradoodle, and a very brave cat.This book is dedicated to Ashbel Green, my editor at Knopf for twenty years andsix books. Ash passed away just as I was finishing the manuscript. We alwaysargued over adverbs, semicolons, and subtitles, conversations that invariablydrifted to the pathetic state of his beloved Cleveland Indians.

See William Howe, TheNarrative of Lieutenant General William Howe…(London, 1780). The earliest casethat Howe’s American sympathies lost the war for Great Britain came from amember of his own staff. See Charles Stedman, The History of the Origin,Progress, and Termination of the American War (Dublin, 1794). In my view, Howe’smotives were psychologically intricate, but his chief mistake was to assume thatBritish victory was assured, so he could afford to fight more cautiously. Likemost British officers, he overestimated the level of loyalist sentiment andunderestimated the staying power of the Continental Army. His concern aboutBritish casualities, though misguided in retrospect, was wholly plausible at thetime.27.
